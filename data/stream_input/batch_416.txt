078322611X|5.0|this is a great movie..great transfer and great extra features...commentary, roundtable with hall of fame baseball players...bravo special ...current day update on the actual field of dreams location....BUT , and its a big one...it does NOT contain the fabulous hour long making of documentary from the initial release!!! as well as many of the other bonus features....<BR>so.....if you are a fan , you will most likely want both editions...<BR>I don't understand why they couldn't have included the bonus features from the first \\"collectors\\" edition to make this the definitive issue...but Like ON GOLDEN POND ...you get a newer edition with great extras which don't duplicate the original....<BR>anyway...just thought I'd warn fans out there who are thinking of \\"trading up\\" for the new edition...
1401300901|4.0|Cecilia Ahern makes a splash with &quot;PS, I Love You,&quot; a surprisingly charming debut about grief, love, family and struggling to move on with life. While Ahern needs to polish up her writing, she has plenty of raw talent, and a good grasp on her quirky characters.<br />Holly and Gerry were the perfect couple. Not sickening perfect, but perfect for one another. And so when Gerry dies of a brain tumor, Holly feels utterly lost and depressed, staying in her apartment and deteriorating. Finally she emerges from her cocoon, but still isn't ready to reembrace life. Despite the efforts of her family and friends, she can't move on.<br />Then she receives a package from beyond the grave: the List. Gerry wrote it before his death, leaving her instructions to do things like buy a bedside lamp, sing karaoke, and ends every note with &quot;PS, I love you.&quot; Holly obeys the List -- sometimes happily, sometimes reluctantly -- and her new experiences help her to remember the past, while looking to the future.<br />&quot;PS I Love You&quot; is not your typical chick-lit. Sure, it has most of the usual trappings -- a young woman out in the world, the loud'n'lovable gay confidante, the outspoken best friend, the eccentric family complete with pink-haired baby sister. But there's no gooey love story with some new Hot Guy Du Jour, nor does it avoid the darker, more depressing experiences.<br />Ahern's writing is the sort that will be excellent when she gets a bit more writing experience. It's almost painfully awkward in places, the sort of thing that normally gets smoothed over by editors. But she has plenty of talent -- she makes the settings and characters come alive. And she knows how to mix grieving and humor, without making the humor less funny or the grief less heart-tugging.<br />Holly herself is a likable character, very true to life and sympathetic. Her family seems a little too bizarre at times, but weirdly enough, we all knows jerks, freaks and lovables like this.  Worse, we're related to some of them. And Gerry himself, despite being dead, is one of the more intriguing personalities in the book even if he only appears in Holly's memory.<br />Ahern needs to work on her sometimes-awkward writing style, but her humorous, melancholy slice of chick-lit  is a sweet read, especially for anyone who has had to say goodbye, and &quot;PS I Love You.&quot;Worse, we're related to some of them. And Gerry himself, despite being dead, is one of the more intriguing personalities in the book even if he only appears in Holly's memory.<br />Ahern needs to work on her sometimes-awkward writing style, but her humorous, melancholy slice of chick-lit  is a sweet read, especially for anyone who has had to say goodbye, and &quot;PS I Love You.&quot;
0780626494|5.0|Brendan Fraser is remarkably good in this good-natured comedy about a young man born and raised in a fallout shelter.  Fraser manages to parlay his rugged good looks and youthful exuberance into an intensely likeable hero named Adam.  Once released into the modern world, Adam is gleefully joyful to watch.  Alicia Silverstone is fine as his \\"Eve\\" who is both enamored and repelled by Fraser's childishly kind behavior.  Dave Foley as her gay friend is marvelous as well.  I also liked Joey Skolnik as the bartender who metamorphoses from a happy teenager to the self-proclaimed monk of a new religion.  Kudos also to Nathan Killion (Firefly series) as Alicia's macho boyfriend who gets put in his place by Fraser.  Also to the delightful dance scene where Fraser and two girls jitterbug to high heaven.  But one cannot overlook the truly marvelous performances from Sissy Spacek and Christopher Walken as Fraser's paranoid parents.  They are both brilliant, and one can see how these two won Oscars for previous performances.  Director Hugh Wilson keeps it all together and I found myself smiling and chuckling all the way through.  A delightful find!
0671004107|5.0|While taking care to keep the fantastical adventure scientifically sound, Sagan seems to have given into his didactic nature. The book is a novel in the sense that it focuses on the central characters' thoughts, feelings, and experiences, but it is also an examination of human culture and philosophy. Fascinating . . . it will provide enlightenment for all future generations.
6304071906|4.0|Heaven's Gate has been unfairly stigmatized by the circumstances of its creation.  According to a documentary aired in a TRIO channel series called FLOPS, the film was done in by Michael Cimino's ambition to create a new &quot;Gone with the Wind.&quot;  What he created, however, was an exciting, ravishingly beautiful art film whose natural audience was much, much smaller than what the studio needed to recoup its expenses.  Some reviewers say that the story was confusing, but I was able to follow it and was quite gripped by it, even though the pacing was slow and it did not spell out the plot details or give obvious clues for the audience in the usual way of Hollywood movies.  I thought this was rather a compliment to my intelligence.  Cimino's obsessive attention to detail -- the ultimate reason for the cost overruns that killed United Artists -- really paid off for this viewer, who loved the authenticity, the sense of being drawn back into another time (although Isabelle Huppert was too modern-looking for her role).  The young Christopher Walken's tender and vulnerable character may be a surprise to those used to seeing him protray ghouls.  I must point out that Kris Kristofferson's Harvard classmate is played by John Hurt (of &quot;Elephant Man&quot;), not William Hurt.
B000021XR5|3.0|this is a good hard rock CD.  with the exception of &quot;sour girl&quot;, most of the tracks are similar driving rock guitar with wyland's unique voice over.  scott wyland and company have locked on to a formula that works, and this CD is it.  it lacks the catchy, driving guitar lines found on purple and the experimentation found on tiny music, but while its not full of incredible tracks, you can put it on and listen to it front to back without skipping over anything, which is more than i can say of some CDs i own.
B00000DRA9|1.0|Apparently I am the only person who has noticed this, but a great majority of the music on this CD is NOT the actual music that plays during the film. I love this film, and have always loved the music in it. I decided to purchase this cd particularly for the song \\"Ivory Tower\\". The music accompanying the arrival at the Ivory Tower always enchanted me and I was eager to have it on a CD for regular listening. However, the Ivory Tower song on this soundtrack CD, is not the stirring orchestration from the film, it is a trumped up synthesizer-ridden dance-mix version of the original Ivory Tower song which pales in comparison to the original. Several of the songs on this album have received the same treatment, and have synthesizer beats and electric guitars added to them, which completely alters the mood of the songs. Why these songs were redone for the soundtrack is beyond me, but prepare to be disappointed if you are looking to hear the score as it is in the actual film. Some songs are left unchanged from the film, but to me, the synthesizing of the others spoils the overall mood of the album.     I recently purchased the German version of this soundtrack, (Die Unendliche Geschichte) off of iTunes, and I must say that I am MUCH happier with this version of the soundtrack. The lovely \\"Ivory Tower\\" song is still missing, but this version of the soundtrack is entirely orchestral, and does not have the horrible souped up synthesized songs of the American version. If you're very fond of the Limahl title song, and can't imagine a soundtrack to The Neverending Story without it, than the American version is right for you, but if you're looking to have a nice copy of the beautiful score of the film, purchasing the German version is definitely the right way to go.

B00009W0U4|4.0|Irreversible is a film that explores the deep pain that human life can have, through extreme violence and sexuality.<br />I have wanted to see this movie for quite a long time, but due to it's graphic nature, (and strong rating) I have not been able to watch it...until now. Incredible performances by all 3 leads, especially Monica Bellucci. This woman has such an amazing beauty that sometimes her look is overpowered by her performance, but in this film, both work for her.<br />You've already heard the story of this film by now, the movie (which is told backwards) is about a woman who got raped in an underpass in Paris. When her 2 closest male friends find out, they both search for the person who violated their best friend.<br />You've already got WARNING written all over this movie because of its graphic violence and strong sexuality. If you have seen Requiem for a Dream, this one is similar to that but just 100x more disturbing. Gaspar Noe's direction is great but completely all over the place, with an enormous amount of camera spins and dizzying movement, which is placed at the beginning of the film.<br />Kudos goes out to the Visual FX team for making the fire extinguisher scene truly disturbing and increbibly hard to watch. The featurette, on the DVD, of how they made that scene work is amazing, from using different layers, all the way to prosthetics. The sound editing of this film is great (especially in that scene) which makes the bashing sounds so hard and grusome that you have just got to turn your head away. The rape scene is also hard to watch as it seems to go on for an eternity. I can't get enough of Bellucci's performance in that scene, where she just gave everything that she had into making it seem belivable and sad all at the same time. (special mention also goes out to Jo Prestia)<br />Gaspar Noe is a director that is for sure a force to be reckoned with. I have not seen his other film 'I Stand Alone' (where the subject matter, from what I've heard,is the same) but for sure, I have got to check that one out. Noe dives into the deepest emotion that a person can have and presents them with brutal honesty. Even if you don't want to admit it, these things happen all the time, to the most unsuspecting people and I belive that Noe made this film because life is not always filled with rainbows and happy people; life is difficult, and for him to shed light on issues and events that most individuals would not even want to tackle, is brave and admirable.<br />Overall, Irreversible is a work of art; filled with great performances, visual fx and direction.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|I am 1/2 Irish, 1/2 British, by heritage, I am a history major and international relations minor, I have written many papers on Anglo-Irish relations for both subjects.  It was the U2 song that got me intrested in the subjects.  I have learned alot about my heritage, and the more I learn, the more I am ashamed of the 1/8 of me that is English (the other 3/8 are Welsh).  I have read about the day from many different people; uninvolved 3rd party historians, Gerry Adams (who was not there), and both Irish and British authors, but seeing it, and knowing that it was a joint froduction of both the Itish and British film boards made me see a light, a comming together to heal old wounds.  This move made me realise that while the English were evil monstars on that day (and on others) the IRA retailated in June of 1972 killing 9 UDA men and 2 soilders, I am a Nationalist, I want to see the North annexed back to the Republic where it belongs, but it can not be done through killing.<BR>As for the movie, it is not for everyone, if you want to learn more about the day or the Troubles in general it is a good way to start.<BR>I have read so much about the conflict that many of the disturbing and heartrenching facts have become common place in my head, but this film made me cry, and still does everytime I watch it.  If you have any interest in the situation and want to learn more, I STRONGLY suggest you watch the film.
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is one of the best films out in years.  If you want to be totally entertained and like action films this is the one to see.  Uma Thurman leads a cast of great actors and actresses.  It is a tale of revenge, very graphic violence, BUT it does have lots of humour.  Alot of it I did not see the first time around.  But if you watch how the movie was made on the DVD you will see things you might have missed watching this intense filem.  I can't wait for Kill Bill 2 to come out.  I will defenitely buy it.  The director and producer deserve all credit they receive and more.  Lucy Liu from (Alley McBeal and Julie Ann Dreyfus from Jerry Seinfeld elspecially, you will not even recognize.  Lucy Liu is again her beautiful and talented self which we have seen before.  BUT Julie Ann Dreyfus is in a totally different role from Jerry Seinfeld.  You probably won't recognize her until the credits.  Uma Thurman should have been nomainated for Best Female Actress.  If not winning, then the competition was extra tough.  Once again, if you want excitement from beginning to end, See Bill 1.  My only warning is you will be beckoning for Kill Bill 2.  Enjoy.

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|\\"Mystic River\\" is a rich, densely-layered movie. Part drama, part psychological thriller, it is one of the finest films of 2003. It is also an actor's dream. Containing at least a half dozen excellent roles, it provided Sean Penn a Best Actor Oscar, as well as one for Tim Robbins as Best Supporting Actor.  <br />`Riveting' is a good word to describe the story. At the start, three boyhood friends are playing games on the sidewalks of a working-class Boston neighborhood. Two men, allegedly cops, abduct one of the boys. He is found a few days later in a cellar. He has been sexually molested and, naturally, is traumatized. The movie implies that no one knows how to deal with what has happened to the boy. It's a working-class, Catholic neighborhood. Life just goes on.<br />Flash forward about thirty years later to the present. Each boy's life has taken a different path. Jimmy [Sean Penn] has become the operator of a successful neighborhood grocery store - but only after a stretch in prison for armed robbery. He still hangs out with the local thugs. Sean [Kevin Bacon] has become a detective with the Boston police department. His professional life is fine but his personal life is a shambles. Dave [Tim Robbins], the one who was kidnapped, lives life as best he can. When Jimmy's teenage daughter is brutally murdered, the three boyhood friends reunite on a chaotic collision course which leads to tragedy. <br />This is not a movie for people with short attention spans. Those who do not pay attention may be befuddled by the end of it. <br />\\"Mystic River\\" is possibly Clint Eastwood's crowning achievement in a long and very interesting career. It's the kind of movie that would be hard for any filmmaker to top.
1586212567|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki &quot;retired&quot; when he was only 47 years old. (His wife was only 37 at the time.) Most people would consider that an early age at which to retire. In order to accomplish this, you need a &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;sure&quot; financial financial plan.<br />The way to do this is to use the power of leverage, otherwise known as &quot;other people's money&quot; (OPM). Kiyosaki's vehicle of choice was real estate, and he credits mortgage brokers with enabling his early retirement. That's because he was using their money to retire (through mortgages on his apartment houses), rather than his own money. He is a &quot;value&quot; investor who invests for cash flow and depreciation (read, tax breaks), which are known ahead of time, rather than appreciation, which is uncertain.<br />In fact, Kiyosaki's &quot;fast&quot; plan is really about getting other people to help you get ahead financially. For instance, if you own 500 (fully rented) apartments, and each unit yields you $50 a month after mortgage payments and expenses ($600 a year net), that's an income of $300,000 a year. The more units you own and the more people you serve, the more money you make. The greatest opportunities lie in low income housing, where the U.S. government wants &quot;qualified&quot; (experienced) landlords to help it solve the problem of housing poor people, and will provide generous subsidies. Alternatively, you can own and manage one or more (small) corporations using teams of people that you assembled yourself. If you know how to work with different types of people, you can &quot;play the fastest game in the world.&quot;<br />I am looking at my 47th birthday as an opportunity to &quot;retire&quot; in a similar fashion to Kiyosaki. I believe I have a &quot;critical mass&quot; of capital, although I don't have his experience with turning around failed companies.  Will his methods work for me? I'm about to find out.
0156027321|3.0|Some wonderful passages (esp when Pi goes blind...) but overall disappointing. Its pretensions to depth seem stilted and the authors voice is irritating. This is a &quot;message&quot; book, of which there are pitifully few these days: its trying to tell you something....but the message itself turns out to be slightly shallow. Frustrating. Nice tiger, though.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This is not a who-done-it. This is high drama, a deep character study. And this is one helluva superior movie. It's 3 kids, working-class poor, whose lives were changed the day one of them was abducted by a pedophile. That opening scene doesn't take long, but it's riveting with menace and seems to last forever. Then, flash forward maybe 3 decades. The boys are now men, each chasing his own demons. <BR>Dave, the man who was abused as a child is married with a child of his own, but he's an emotional shell, vulnerable in his arrested development. Jimmy, the brash one as a kid, is still brash. He did 2 years in prison for a petty crime and is now a devoted father of 3 daughters and owner of a corner store in the old neighborhood. Sean is an unemotional homicide detective whose job it is to notify Jimmy of his daughter's death and find her killer.<BR>The three have long ago drifted apart. Then Jimmy's 19yo daughter from a first marriage is murdered. And somebody's got to pay. Turns out they all pay in different ways.<BR>The directing by Clint Eastwood is superb; those who have read the excellent book will be pleased at how carefully he stays true to it. The acting is beyond superb; the three men are so perfectly cast that you completely forget they're acting. In this respect, the movie belongs to Sean Penn, an actor who's kept getting better and better and better over the years till now: and now, he's perfect. The plot is crafty and convoluted. The setting, shot in a working-class Boston neighborhood, is realistic. <BR>There are only a couple of oddly weak spots, and they're not weak enough to deserve the loss of a rating star. But Sean (the cop) had a nameless, faceless, estranged wife who keeps calling him and not speaking - and this is left unexplained. And Laura Linney plays Jimmy's wife (the only questionable bit of casting, IMO) who has this rather long speech near the end that's kind of out of nowhere and pretty over-the-top.<BR>Still, five solid stars and at least one Oscar nomination, for sure. Maybe 2 or 3. Top rating.
0743243307|5.0|Stunning. This is great novel about love, fitting in, and the pain of loss. More importantly, this is how it is for many muslim immigrants, and as such is almost social realism. One of the best London novels I've read in years. Oh and Brick lane itself is wonderfully realised too: you can almost smell the spices coming off the page.
B00005U18E|2.0|This is the story of a 30-something unmarried woman w/out any self-respect who snivels her way through life. I suspect there is something sinister behind the reasons why people find this &quot;entertaining&quot; or &quot;hilarious&quot;. It just made me cringe. It's a terrible movie, but in fairness, the actors played their parts well, such as they were. But even the ruse of an actor gaining/losing weight for a role has become a cliche, ever since &quot;Raging Bull&quot;. Hey, if you want a fat person, why not just hire one? Actually, &quot;Bridget&quot; wasn't fat; her clothes were just too small (not to mention tasteless, as was this film).
B0000039PW|5.0|This is really one of the best rap albums to come out in the 90s. Yes, there are some bad songs and some of the intros are really annoying. For example the one intro when Biggie is banging some girl is really unneeded. All in all the intros are the weakest part of the album and by far the easiest parts to skip over. But enough about the bad when there is so many good things to say about this masterpiece. Things Done Changed is a cool back in the day song and is indeed enjoyable, then comes the very catchy Gimme the Loot. Although the subject matter of that song is laughable the chorus is very catchy. More highlights are the spectacular Ready to Die, the classic Juicy (great hip hop bass line), and the dance party favorite Big Poppa. <BR>However the greatness of this album is all about the producing. I saw Biggie live and he didn't sound the same, he sounded more flat and not as impressive as he does through a stereo. Every song is recorded prefectly. Big Poppa for example has each part in perfect balance. I can hear Biggie rapping and every little nuance in the background music. For some reason rappers today cannot get that down and they spew their inarticulate lyrics at lightning speed and everything turns into a blur, but every single one of Biggie's songs is produced perfectly. Puff Daddy really knew what was up for this aentire album.<BR>Also the entire album embodies the American myth of rags to riches and then an early death. Sonehow all of his lyrics are prophetic of what would happen to him and they all create the narrative of an amazing life of an amazing rapper. <BR>R.I.P Biggie
0446677450|1.0|This is another case of follow the herd behavior. After reading this book I was amazed by how little it insight it offers. There is really nothing there behind all the fluff. The funny thing is that I bought this book based on all the positive reviews on Amazon - but these reviews could not have been further from the truth.<br />If anything, I am more confused than I was before reading this book. It offers nothing in the way of a plan on how to build up your asset base or on how to cut your expenses. This book is nothing but a collection meaningless drivel with very little grounding in reality. I was really glad to discover that the author invests in real estate - but other than stating that he buys distressed properties below market value - the usual meaningless cliche, no other information is provided.<br />In retrospect, I should have looked more carefully at some of the negative reviews on this site. Many of the reviewers mention exactly the points I described above. I feel like I have wasted my time and money reading this book. What a waste.
B000002NFM|5.0|Most people are idiots - many people understand this fact, and that it applies to them - however, under partiucular circumstances the average man can forget that he is a complete idiot for a brief period of time, during this time he may look even more idiotic than at other intervals, but on the inside he feels only sheer adrenaline pumping excitement - this album combined with some big speakers and a couple of shots of tequila, can definitely provide the average idiot with a simple means of escape from his own lunacy - One Love -
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Room on Fire is pretty much a mixed bag. Its true that the strokes seem to only have one style of song, but on Room on Fire they try out some different rhythms and guitar textures. There are several exceptional tracks and cool guitar riffs flow throughout. Although I personally expected a bit more, I think this album fares better than most nowadays, thus the 4 star rating. Over all this is a solid (and a bit repetitive) effort.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm a total Christina fan, she's my idol, and this album ROCKS! Is make me want to cry! She's finally coming out of the mold. sHe's never been who she really wanted to be, and now she's finally expressing herself and what she wants to say. She had a ruff childhood, and thinking how far she came to get to where she is today is so inspirational. You can do what ever you want if you put your mind to it, and Christina is living proof. She's finally being herself, thru all the public critisem. Definatly this album is worth the money. Support Christina! She's worked so hard to get here! BUY THIS ALBUM
B00006RAKP|3.0|Many of these greatest hits collections are great for casual fans to get to know the artists. But for me I ALWAYS find my favourite songs are non-hits anyway. <BR>Heres my favourite Elton Songs:<BR>Your Song, Memory of Love, Blue Eyes, The One, First Episode at Hienton, Take me to the pilot, Fat Boys and ugly girls, Street Boogie, Lil Fridgerator, Gypsy Heart, Skyline Pigeon, Country Comfort, Return to Paradise, I need your to turn to, Wide Eyed and Laughing, I am your robot, Harmony, Hard-luck story, Heels of the wind, Carla Etude, Sixty Years on, Breaking Down Barriers, My fathers gun, All the nasties, Princess, I fall apart, etc.<BR>Only five of those 25 songs even charted. So for big-time fans this GR. Hits is perhaps a bunch of songs that you've heard too much. So for casual fans only. But then I find this compilation annoying. It was an attempt to get his early 70's fans into his later period or perhaps his 90's music fans into his 70's stuff. We could exclude everything pre- Live in Australia [or Reg strikes back] because the songs from that era are covered on Greatest hits '74, Greatest hits Vol.2, '77 and the 76-86 collection. This could have been a more comprehensive collection of the 88-01 period and then casual fans could go and get all four. Now songs like 'Simple Life', 'The Last Song', 'Recover Your Soul', 'True Love' [with Kiki Dee], 'A word in Spanish', 'Healing Hands', 'Club at the end of the street', among others, will never be heard on a greatest hits collection.
0312263120|2.0|After having read the Da Vinci Code, my first Dan Brown novel, I expected great things from Digital Fortress. Being a techno-geek, I was attracted to the digital-encryption theme that is the hook of this story. Unfortunately, the characterization is sub-standard. You just don't care what happens to any of these people. The plot is interesting, but unbelievable.<br />Angels and Demons is much better, although Da Vinci Code is probably the best of Brown's lot so far.<br />If you're into techno-thrillers, I would recommend Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon, an 1100-page journey through World War II code-breaking, hidden gold, and brilliant characters. It's a marathon read, but highly interesting, and much more believable.

B000274THQ|5.0|This is probably the best movie to come out of Germany in the last 20 years.  I can personally guarantee that it is the best in the last three years.  I saw this movie two years ago in German and can only hope the translation does it justice.  It is one of the sweetest and funniest stories out there in a real life bitter sweet sort of way.  If you have any interest in what has ever gone on in the world, or ever asked a German friend of mine \\"was it REALLY communist in Eastern Germany?\\"  Look I know what you mean...more what was it like in the DDR but if you want to have an idea please watch this movie...all the good sides and many of the bad sides in an \\"ostaligia\\"  (ost means east) sort of way.  BTW I have recommended this movie to every western german I know.  <br />Take care and please enjoy!
020530902X|5.0|For writers and those who work in publishing this little book contains a lot of matters worthy of consideration.  It's not the most useful book I have on the subject (that honour goes to &quot;Style Book&quot; by Derek Wallace and Janet Hughes published in 1995) and I don't agree with everything the authors have to say, but it does contain a lot of useful tips, pointers and ways of polishing your text.  You can't go wrong by giving it a careful read.
B000002H97|5.0|This is another time less classic Metallica album. This album was probably the most bashed on in the early 90's for a reason being that Metallica has \\"sold out\\" to their old fans, but Metallica has always been a band to do things their way, in defiance of the music trends that have been taking place. This is the beginning of the opening for a new generation of Metallica fans on the horizon. The music has been stripped down into more a simplistic song structure, but the aggressiveness of the old Metallica still remains and is clearly noticable, James's rythm guitar still chugs through with groove while his vocals of the old are still heard and sounding well, Kirk's lead guitar still wails with awesome complex solo's that have always been his trademark screach through, and Lars's drumming has been more stripped down and less complex, but still sounding hard n' heavy like the previous Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets albums. With the songs being cut down, it still leaves room for Hetfield's impressive songwriting, it includes the classic tracks Enter Sandman, The Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters, Through The Never, Wherever I May Roam and Of Wolf and Man; it also includes a song they made for the Gulf War era in Don't Tread on Me. The Black Album is a true Metallica masterpeice that should not be over looked, stop your Metallica collection with this album so you should have Kill 'Em All through Metallica; and you will be glad that you did!
B0000CABBW|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  My wife and I watched it and when it started slow, she lost interest.  I was lazy and didn't want to get off the couch so I stuck with it.  What a reward!  This movie was inspirational, just a tad predicatble, but well written and well acted.<br />I rarely care about the Oscars but I really wanted Keisha Castle-Hughes to win her category.  True to form, the politics of Hollywood prevented her from winning, but no matter.  This movie was wholesome and entertaining.  It covers the social stigmas that will inevitably arise in any culture and does its best to break down barriers.<br />Hopefully there will be no sequel because the point was made in this movie.  Any future movie will just try to cash in on the finanical laurels of the first and will likely be just an attempt to make money.
0393324818|5.0|Moneyball is the most captivating and interesting book I have ever read.  It's a book that shows the secrets of success in baseball.  Author Michael Lewis writes about Billy Beane, the General Manager of the Oakland Athletics, and his innovative method of scouting and management that changed the way baseball is played.  Beane was able to maximize the market of talent with a minimum of spending.  Alongside assistant Paul PoDesta, he broke down statistics to figure out how many games needed to be won to make the playoffs.  A formula was created that evaluated every action on the field into a point system.  What that point system determined was how many runs the A's would have to score to win.  The Oakland Athletics, with the payroll worth nearly 1/3 of the mighty New York Yankees, are capable of competing every year for a championship and that's thanks to Beane.  As a fan of a team with a low payroll, I get a thrill of them defeating the usual powerhouses.  Moneyball gives the fans of small market teams a reason to believe that next year could be their year.  This book is a must read for all baseball fans and I highly recommend it.
B000002KIK|3.0|I'm &quot;Over to you&quot;'s complete fan, this song stands out above the others because of the mix: classic-cool piano-ing + powerful BS-like rythm section + gospel-like &quot;triumphing&quot; organ + Ozzy's unique raging/whining voice = oppressively romantic white blues. A giant outdoor for Ozzy, however he cares of that song's power!!! <br />Happy for the other reviewers who enjoy the whole album ...
B00005JK8K|1.0|First of all I will say that the importance of the concept for this film is necessary and much overlooked. The involvement of American Indians in war is sadly left out of too many history books.<br />I was hoping this film would be better than it turned out to be. The historical facts should be recoginized along side all of the other celebrations of war heroes. Sadly this film was a complete bomb. The direction was predictable and the action scenes could have been shot by a five year old boy playing &quot;war hero&quot; in the backyard, alot of noise and piles of dust and actors pretending to be dead. All this with the constant drone of a musical score best left for a karoke bar to hum along to.<br />And what happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to be a great actor with individual style and presentation. It seems that he just keeps slipping away. I just was not convinced of his &quot;hero&quot; ability in this film....and his death scene is almost the most horrendous I have ever witnessed, not for the gore or emotional impact, but because it was simply awful acting!
B00023B1A8|4.0|Knowing the street date was June 9th, I stopped off at Best Buy, they didn't have it, but that's not surprising, they didn't have Cat Stevens two weeks earlier. I then went to the local record store and there sat one copy each of CSN &quot;Acoustic&quot; and &quot;Daylight&quot; again. I now own about 100 Concert DVD's, all are classic rock, two weeks earlier I picked up Cat Stevens &quot;Majikat&quot; from 1976, Doobie Bros &quot;Rockin' Down the Highway&quot; from 1996 and Simon &amp; Garfunkel at Central Park from 1981. One of my first DVD purchases about two years ago was a Supertramp show from 1983 and I've been turned off on buying older shows ever since, normally looking for newer concerts because of the audio and video. However recently I picked up the Doors Collection and the 1968 L.A. show that's included is pretty good so I've expanded my horizon. If your a fan of Cat Stevens, his new DVD will blow you away, even though I've held a grudge for his changes in lifestyle and religion it was easy to forget all that. Now, two weeks later I'm sitting down to watch CSN Acoustic &amp; Daylight Again. I start off with the older 1983 Daylight again. I've been a fan since 1969 but have never seen them in person, I own the Woodstock DVD, and I can remember wearing out the Deja Vu record while stationed overseas in 1970-'71 and later the Four Way Street album. First off, the DVD audio and video are excellent, as good as any current DVD recordings. The concert was pretty much as I expected, a good backup band, a mix of old and newer songs, some acoustic, some electric and some with Graham on piano. I didn't know Graham Nash played guitar, it's interesting when they open and you see three guitars standing side-by-side. I would recommend buying this DVD, giving it 4 out of 5 stars. The second DVD, &quot;Acoustic&quot; recorded 1991, I'll probably rewatch more because it includes more of the songs I like. Stephen Stills is plugged in quite a bit of the time, so the main difference is there are no drums or keyboard backup, however CSN is good either way. The audiences on both concert DVD's are really into the band, but on the &quot;Acoustic&quot; DVD the San Franciscan crowd is a bigger part of the event, probably because it's a little smaller venue and the band invites them to be more vocal. Even though it's billed as acoustic, it's an energetic show, I would give &quot;Acoustic&quot; 4-1/2 stars. Do what I did, buy both DVD's.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|So I followed the hype and finally indulged myself....but I have to say I was lost period, even a translation dictionary wouldn't help me understand what people find so great about this movie.<br />Bill Murray plays an old fart going through a mid-life crisis in Japan. So of course he is lonely and lost, big surprise! Scarlett Johansson is the young pretty thing living in Japan with her new husband who happens to be too busy to pay her much attention. So she is bored and lonely. Gee, I wonder what happens?<br />I was bored watching this movie it felt a little too close to a day spent pacing the floor for something to do. Two people floundering around in Japan exposing themselves to situations that mean absolutely nothing. A great love story? NO! A surprise? NO! How many times do bad relationships start out exactly like the two characters in this movie? ALWAYS! The better message would be found in part two.....where the two lost people discover how stupid they were in the first place. But how many times have we seen a couple of bored people give up their lives for that moment of false recoginition...too many!
B000069HK2|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I wasn't really open minded.  I listened to it once and put it in my case...I just recently took it out again and I've been listening to it a lot lately.  It's the perfect CD to sit in a dark room and blast through headphones.  I kinda feel dumb for putting it away for so long.  I'm a new fan of these guys.  Congrats, and I can't wait for the new album in July.

0553213105|5.0|I loved this book because it really grabbed my attention from the beginning.  It also kept me away from the fridge for a good while so I skipped out on a lot of fatty snacks.  I lost five pounds reading this book.  Never mind &quot;The South Beach Diet&quot;.  Read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.
B00000JLWW|5.0|in my books thisis my fave movie.the best part in the flik is whenthe ship sinks.this is the best movie ever.i found that they chose the perfect and cutist acter in the world to play jake(lenordo dicaprio)<br />the movie is 3 hours and 14 minutes but it is going to be the best 3 hours and 14 minutes in your life
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I watched this movie the other night not thinking that it was not going to be that good considering some of the reveiws that I had read. I LOVED IT!!!! The movie was great from the start to the finish. I dont know to much about the real Mike, so I am not sure if the movie follows that story line or not, (I just ordered the shockamentary). I have watched this movie twice already and I sure to watch it several more times. If you are thinking about buying this movie....DO IT!!!!!
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I never heard the debut D12 album Devils Night, but this album gave me a good idea of what they might have sounded like. But anyway, this album is okay. the only tracks i really like are My Band and 40 Oz (is there a video for it???) and the rest are either okay or kinda bad. Eminem soundz a bit different in this album than he did in his solo albumz, cuz in this he sounds more laid back and in hiz soloz he sounded like he had real energy. honestly i think Eminem should use his normal rapping voice cuz if he did i would like this album a lot more. Without him, i would not listen to this album.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Ok lets get one thing straight.....i am not usually into this type of music....I have since gotten tired of crap rock, manufactured BS that has nothing behind it.  It all sounds the same to me.  I heard Duality on the radio and was hooked on it, i sung the chorus all day long. So i bought the cd....blew me away, along with the harder stuff....acoustics? I couldnt belive me ears.  Havent taken it out of my cd player yet, and a funny feeling not for a lond time
B000084T18|4.0|damn man this album iz hot!!! i am not a very big fan of 50 Cent (which is the explanation for the 4 starz) but geez this album iz kool! Unfortunately my mom really hatez 50 Cent so she wouldn't let me buy it and grounded me when she found out i borrowed it from someone. it still mystifies me why shez okay with Eminem but hatez 50...course, she's never heard Eminem :)anyway 50 does real good on this and my fave track is Patiently Waiting (mostly b/c it has Eminem on it) and P.I.M.P is pretty good too (although i like the G Unit remix with Snoop Dogg better) and i hope 50 continuez to release albumz as good as this one...i won't be able to buy them though :(
B00005JLSE|1.0|Back in the 1970's, Liza Minnelli rescued this work from becomming a Broadway flop and turned the box-office around as soon as she stepped into the lead role.  Liza recorded great versions of &quot;All That Jazz&quot; and &quot;My Own Best Friend&quot; and was at one point rumored to be signed for the lead in the motion picture &quot;Chicago&quot; with Goldie Hawn as the co-lead!!  Now that would have been a classic and it is sad that for some strange reason this classic pairing did not happen except in an extraordinary TV Special &quot;Goldie And Liza&quot; which should be released on DVD!  What we have here is a movie with no Superstar musical talents and it shows!!  The movie plays like so many videos today and doesn't have the depth and substance of the musicals from the classic period that is gone.  For a major motion picture musical you simply need a major musical star (or two!) to really make it a great classic!!  This &quot;Chicago&quot; is a lightly entertaining movie that could have been a all-time great classic.  When will Hollywood learn or does it even care anymore...
B0001AVZA8|1.0|I'd rather gouge out my eyes with a dinner fork then sit through this movie a second time.  The acting was fine, of course with this cast that's a given, but the story is so horribly horrible... only rich divorced women over 50 would even get a chuckle out of it.  The plot is so obvious and the dialog was so unreal it made me feel like Moses lost in the desert as I searched the barron wastland for the ending credits.<br />I think the one tag line from the movie says it all &quot;...what about birth control?&quot;<br />&quot;menopause, don't worry&quot;<br />&lt;shiver&gt;<br />AN
B000002AVF|4.0|By this point, Mariah Carey has become one of the biggest acts in the music industry.  This collection, however, shows the beginnings of the dowfall of Mariah.  The Diva attitude started to come through.  The mix of several producers starts to show the disjoint theme and arrangements throughout the CD.  Her first 2 albums had a cohesiveness that this CD doesn't have.    However, there were some stand-out performances on this CD.  \\"Fantasy\\" was a great revival of an obscure 80s song.  Mariah's version is better than the 80s song.  ONE SWEET DAY was a great collaboration with Boys II Men.  \\"Open Arms\\" was a cover of an 80s ballad but this version doesn't have the type of umph found in the original.
B000062TU1|4.0|I really wish that Warner Brothers would release a 'directors cut', which would put back the deleted scenes.  Especially since that is what they are showing on network TV.  I would definitely purchase an extended version of this movie.
B0000028P8|5.0|Mariah Carey was so big in the early 90s that MTV immediately gave her a spot in their Unplugged line-up.  Her modesty was sweet.  The big hit from this CD is her cover of the Jackson 5's \\"I'll Be There.\\"  The rest are songs from her previous 2 albums.
0060392584|5.0|One of the best autobios ever. Read this!
B00000273M|4.0|Obviously, the girls didn't have anough hits to fill a Greatest Hits compilation.  Maybe this CD should be called &quot;Greatest Moments.&quot;  However, even if you don't know all of the songs, they are worth listening to.  <br />The songs are varied which makes this disc nice to listen to.  It doesn't drag on like many other artists' discs that have songs that sound the same all the way through.  <br />These gals are quite talented.  I would recommend this disc to anyone who has enjoyed their songs in the past.
B0000025ZF|5.0|Contrary to what many say, Roger Waters' solo albums are excellent. Check out this dense, intelligent album.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|27 #1 hits!  That's a lot of songs!  Too bad it couldn't include top 5 songs but could you imagine how songs that would be????<br />The cover booklet is great.  Imagaes of the album covers and record covers are priceless.<br />The Beatles are definitely one of the best bands ever to have recorded music.
B0000027I6|5.0|Contrary to what many say, Roger Waters' solo albums are excellent. Check out this dense, intelligent album.
B00008PX8P|5.0|The most amazing DVD I have ever seen.  I had a single complaint with it, and that is the rare but still very annoying still shots at the end of each segment.<br />Aside from that, Jimmy Page's performance on Dazed and Confused and his solo White Summer are phenomenal, not to mention Bonham's riveting drum solo in Moby Dick, extended to a full 15 minutes.  This proves why Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B0001ME5L2|5.0|Avril Lavigne has once again proved she's not just some artist to pass up.  I recommend this Cd and her previous one (Let Go)to anyone who wants to listen to something new and different.  Here's the songs broken down:<BR>1.  Take Me Away 5/5 <BR>2.  Together 4/5  (reminds me of a previous relationship!)<BR>3.  Don't Tell Me 5/5 cool song- nice lyric &quot;did you think that I was going to give it up for you?&quot; <BR>4.  He Wasn't 5/5 (see note about song #2)<BR>5.  How Does It Feel 5/5 One of the best songs on the album<BR>6.  My Happy Ending 5/5  <BR>7.  Nobody's Home 5/5 Both versions are totally awesome; One of my favorites<BR>8.  Forgotten  3/5  an &quot;okay&quot; song (sorry Avril)<BR>9.  Who Knows  4/5  <BR>10.  Fall to Pieces 5/5  Catchy tune you could sing all day <BR>11.  Freak Out 5/5 So I'm up to 3 favorite songs and heres number 4..<BR>12.  Slipped Away  5/5  I heard this song is about her Grandfather who passed away, it's pretty powerful and you can relate if you've lost anyone, much different from her other songs but still gets credit as a favorite.<BR>13.  I always get my way  3/5 Bonus track that sounds like a &quot;for fun&quot; song
B00003CXE7|1.0|I thoroughly HATED this movie.  The fight scene with the tigers was visually spectacular, but that doesn't make up for a drudgingly dull plot &amp; awful acting from Russell Crowe.  He Is, in my opinion, the single most over-rated actor in the last 20 years.  He has gone above and beyond when it comes to OVER ACTING, none of his roles that I've seen have been convincing OR entertaining.  I am certainly not qualified to critisize an actor and nobody may find my review to be helpful, but I have to be honest in my opinions and mine is this:  THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER!
B000002UVX|5.0|There's no denying that the best band Jimi would play in would be the Experience mark II (Jimi, Billy Cox, and Mitch Mitchell), but the Band of Gypsy's was a fine group.  Here we see (or more like hear) Jimi expanding his sound into funkier directions. &quot;Who Knows&quot; and &quot;Power to Love&quot; all have very funk-a-licious grooves and some crazy guitar playing (something we all know Hendrix was the best at).  His lyrics are a lot more laid-back, as well (&quot;Ah, gettin' high every day is easy/even the jellyfish will tell you that&quot;).  Buddy Miles also takes the spotlight on his two original tracks &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;We Got to Live Together&quot;.  He is a good songwriter and a fine singer, and his songs don't detract from the album, but the show is still Jimi's. The best track, undeniably, is &quot;Machine Gun&quot;.  Here Jimi expands on the protest-song genre he started with &quot;House is Burning Down&quot;.  His lyrics are powerful and image invoking (&quot;evil man make me kill you/evil man make you kill me/even though we're only families apart&quot;).  And it must be noted that this performance of &quot;Machine Gun&quot; may well be the best twelve minutes of guitar playing ever captured on tape.  The solo is, in my humble opinion, the greatest guitar solo of all time.  Hendrix not only mixes scales and all that other revolutionary stuff he did, but he makes his guitar sound like planes, bombs, and whizzing bullets.  Marvelous. Another high point to the album is that it was recorded so well.  Back in 1969, live recording technology was not the best.  But here, everything sounds perfect.  Every drum and every cymbal can be heard perfectly.  Billy's bass is clear and precise, and Jimi's guitar sounds HUGE, the way it should sound.  Some people may complain that the vocals sound too midrangey, but that's what makes them remain clear and cut through the mix.   If you're a fan of Hendrix and you don't own &quot;Band of Gypsy's&quot;, you need to get it.  If you're a fan of great guitar playing, you need to get it.  And, if you're a fan of great live performances, you need to get it.
B00005V9IK|2.0|Boring disappointment.  Oh yes, folks, I said boring.  Not recommended.
B00004W52U|5.0|This is an amazing album that defies all the boring punk releases that were put out in the late 80's/early 90's.  This album was put out in such a stagnate stage in punk rock, the days before it's complete demise.  Most bands coming out of the bay area all sounded the same, some were good and some were bad.  Then came Operation Ivy and they shook everything up.  Like an explosion they came and went and their effect was felt every since.  They seem to just put everything into this, hardcore, punk and they even make ska sound good.  Though they are traditional described as punk-ska I think they transcend that boring description.  These guys are amazing, the album is titled energy, just as if any other title would do this any more justice.  Never a more aptly titled record, whither your skating, driving or hanging out with your friends this album just seems to make every good time better and every bad time seem okay.  Just buy this and wish that you could have been around when they were around and while you wish that, hope that they NEVER EVER do a reunion tour.  All the members of this band have gone such seperate ways that you could never really get the same feel.  This album... just thinking about it makes me nostalgic and if you feel me, you'd say the same thing.
B000069HUF|4.0|J'ai aim&eacute; ce film, je suis tomb&eacute; dessus par hasard. Un ami l'avait louer et l'avait trouv&eacute; moyen. Il me l'a d&eacute;crit et j'ai r&eacute;alis&eacute; qu'il s'agissait d'un remake. Comme sa location n'&eacute;tait pas termin&eacute; je l'ai vu gratuitement. J'ai toujours aim&eacute; la version original de ce film. C'est un grand classique pour moi.<br />J'ai &eacute;t&eacute; ravit par la mani&egrave;re dont le r&eacute;alisateur a modifi&eacute; les choses juste assez pour que ce ne soit pas une copie. Le chercheur avait un but diff&eacute;rent et r&eacute;alise des principes non abord&eacute;s dans la version originale. La sc&egrave;ne ou la lune se brise, wow. Inqui&egrave;tudes &agrave; la sauce du jour.<br />La seul chose que j'aime moins c'est la destruction des m&eacute;chants. Un peu tir&eacute; par les cheveux, mais que veux-tu, on ne peut pas tout avoir.
B000001IQH|4.0|Many people are all over Rancid, I don't know why but I just can't understand why?  They are okay at best and have a few great songs, but honestly what is so great?  I know that Operation Ivy were at great band, but their old essence is not felt in Rancid.  So this is supposed to be thier best cd, so I bought it becuase when in my High School days this was the band that everyone was jocking.  I popped it into my player and I did like it, but as the years went on I never really would spark up when I heard these songs.  There wouldn't really be any \\"Dude it's Rancid these guys take me way back.\\"  So, what is the big deal?  They didn't really bring much to the table, they have a few good bands on thier label and that's about all I can think about when it comes to Rancid.  And this album is so long!  I swear it seems like I'm watching a boring action movie with a few good parts.  So in other words, you probably already own this album and if you don't you probably shouldn't really bother, this album is past it's prime and should remain untouched by future generations.  Rancid already refried this stuff in their subsequent releases, so buy those.  Leave this one alone!    Post Script:  I sorta changed my mind about this, yeah it's like four years later and it had probably been that long since I last listened to it.  So I go to my cousin's marriage and it's Memorial Day weekend and we are driving to the reception and stuck in traffic, the traffic was hell too, plus I was really uncomfortable cause I was sitting by this girl that I sorta like but sorta don't like and you know how that is.  So I'm going through my cousin's cd's and I come across this and I am like \\"what the hell, it's been years\\" and we play this and my hell, every song came alive for me.  Maxwell Murder came pounding out of the speakers and I was taken back to the good old days before I became so damned pathetic, 11th Hour is a new favorite of mine I've been playing that lately and you know the rest the usual roll call Ruby Soho, Timebomb, M.I.A.  So in short this is an amazing album, a classic and it is a really big deal that a band could put out an album with so many memorable songs on it.  I'm grateful it got me through a very awkward moment and if you knew the half of it you'd appreciate it too.  So I was a young idiot when I wrote the stupid review and I completely disagree with it now, this album should be required listening for anyone who is remotely into music, not just punk rock or ska or whatever the hell.  Solid album and a definite classic.
B00005JMUA|4.0|Wow! What a great ending. Unlike Volume 1, Volume 2 depicts more emotional experiences and not blood baths. A very confusing plot, but a very detailed one. And for those thinking there is going to be a Volume 3, there isnt!!! This is the second half of the great Kill Bill and it shows what Uma Thurmans character (u find out her real name in the movie!) has 3 left to kill on her list. This is wonderful how the story connects and how the movie is layed out. the movie is sort f a prequel, sequel and a summary of Volume 1. ONLY WATCH THIS IF YOU LIKED VOLUME 1!!!!!!!!
0679720200|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend of mine and had often heard of it from teachers and fellow students. It wasn't until I had read it, that I realized what all the buzz was about. This book is phenomenal! I can't even describe it well enough to give it full justice, but it leaves you with such curiosity and wonder on how the life of an emotionally disattached, cynical, and annoyingly [ but at the same time amusingly ] nonchalant man can turn into such a catastrophy. I found myself smirking at the way his mind worked sometimes, because it simply seemed morally incomprehensible. It really gives a voice to the state of life that existentialists emphesize. I would highly suggest reading this whether you are looking for a quick, zesty read [this book is very short], or a look into the philosophies of existentialism and Albert Camus' work. It's really something!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Every mention of this new album previous to it's release said to expect something diffent and to forget what you think you know; they were all right!  This album is a very different sound from the other two.  There are some slower tracks but they heavy stuff is still as raw as slipknot has given us before.  The music hits hard, I mean, it is HEAVY STUFF!  <br />Don't shy away because people say it slow, it's not that bad.  The slower songs are good and there are only a few.  The heavy tracks are heavy and they hit hard.  There is a slight hint of Stone Sour in this album which I didn't really apreciate but it does not prevent the enjoyment of any song. People also complain about it sounding different.  IOWA was different from the first so Vol 3 is differetn from IOWA.  All bands have a verying sound from album to album.  This album sounds differen but still sounds like slipknot.  Good Slipknot. <br />FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW: VOL 3
B00006879E|5.0|So, I bought this CD based only on other reviews and the fact that &quot;This Love&quot; is an amazing song with a cool video. I like mostly all of the songs except for two. <BR>1.) Harder To Breathe - cliche, insipid, over played. 2/5<BR>2.) This Love - this song deserves the 24/7 play time on the radio. It also has the best video ever. 5/5<BR>3.)Shiver - Another great song. 5/5<BR>4.) She Will Be Loved - My absolute favorite song EVER. 6/5<BR>5.) Tangled - The other bad song 0/5<BR>6.) The Sun - Greatness, greatness, greatness 5/5<BR>7.) Must Get Out - A good song, though confusing 4/5<BR>8.) Sunday Morning - I first heard this song on the LoveActually soundtrack and loved it since then 4/5<BR>9.) Secret - not the best but not bad 3/5<BR>10.) Through With You - A good song, though the &quot;i hate my ex&quot; theme seems to be a little over done by now. 4/5<BR>11.) Not Coming Home - A good song, and the fact that it's live makes it even cooler 4/5<BR>12.) Sweetest Goodbye - Another song on the LoveActually but it was cool to hear the whole thing. 5/5<BR>My suggestion: hear the samples on this website and if you like what you hear: BUY!
B00005JMUA|5.0|Kill Bill Vol. 2 is incredible!<br />This movie completes the Kill Bill epic and does it well.  Many are dissapointed by the lack of action in the film and they are right.  There is far less action in the movie as vol. 2 goes more for plot and character development.  Don't be shyed away though, the fight scnenes that there are are incredible just like in the first.<br />Vol. 2 is more for people who like good movies and care what happens with the plot.  \\"Common-Folk\\" need non-stop attention getting like in Vol. 1. Character interactions in Vol. 2 are long and drawn out, so you have to really be enjoying the story.  There is a scene where Uma gets buried alive and if you watch this in the dark with surround sound you will feel like you are being buried alive yourself.  When I saw this in theatres I felt my chest getting tight and noticed how much I suddenly hated trying to breath.  What a mind trip!<br />This movie completes the epic and makes Kill Bill one of the best films I have ever seen in my life!  Thank you, Quentin.
B000002WYT|5.0|This CD is so good only one word can desbribe it,(...)Go buy it right now.
B00004YW6I|4.0|This album is my introduction to PJ Harvey. I must say it's great work even though some people say it's more polished than her earlier albums. I'm sure my opinion about this album will change once I listen to her older albums (I may like them better, who knows) but for now I am content with this. Standouts include 'Big Exit' (which includes one of my favorite lines 'This world's crazy, give me the gun!') the optimistic 'Good Fortune', the unique 'The Whore's Hustle And The Hustlers Whore', the crazy 'Kamikaze', and my favorite 'This Is Love'. If you are looking for a female songwriter/singer/guitarist that is a cut above the mainstream then PJ is your choice. Enjoy.
B00009Y3SA|1.0|Does one good performer make a good movie?  Fat chance!  It doesn't even make a halfway decent one!  Am I referring to the leading man/woman Rob Schneider?  Hell no!!  He's as bad as ever in this misfortune of a movie that wasted an hour or so of my life that I cannot get back.  He tries to be like Adam Sandler, but, even if you can't stand Adam's humor, at least Adam can pull it off.  Adam's brief moment in The Hot Chick is better than any acting that Mr. Schneider has ever provided for us (that's saying a lot; Adam's cameo was terrible in this film!)  Rob should stick to robbing gas stations; his humor....hahaha......humor......I can't believe I actually began to give him credit for creating humor.probably his best line in the movie is \\"These should come with a warning: earrings may come with penis.\\"  And that is his best.....pitiful!!  Maybe that line would have been funny if Rob understood this thing called comic delievery!  Also, looking like a constipated cow is NOT FUNNY!!  At that point, I had to laugh, thinking to myself \\"Is he really this bad of an actor?  What would a normal actor have to be paid to be seen in a movie with this guy?\\"  Which brings me to what I was saying earlier, about the one good performer in this movie.  I think we all know that I am referring to Ann Faris.  Obviously, she was given lousy material to work with, and, as a result, could hardley generate any laughs.  However, Faris does know how to pull off comedy with little effort, mostly via her facial expressions (see Scary Movie trilogy for much better examples of her acting!)  I can only imagine the large sum of money she demanded to be seen with this goon.  Most of the other actors/actresses in this movie are young and looking for a big break.  Sorry kids, it ain't gonna happen with this pile of Godforsaken crap.  If you want a better movie, go to your local retail store and randomly pick any movie off the shelf.  (...)

Ever since I finished the the three first books I have started reading fantacy yet I haven't found books close to the caliber of these books.  Since then, I've read books by Robin Hobb's, Terry Brooks, Rober Jordan, Katharine Kerr.  None of them can compare to George Martin.  His charecter development is awesome.

B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|I pre-ordered the campaign edition directly from Racket Records with my expectations high, as the band touted this latest effort to be a &quot;peach&quot; of an album.  When I recieved my copy, the CD box artwork was stunning to say the least but it paled in comparison to the music within:  Marbles is probably the most clever Marillion work, with such diverse use of every band members talents.  Like most Marillion albums, Marbles requires many listens to fully appreciate the complexity and beauty of their music.  Favorite songs are replaced and then become favorites again, only to be replaced by other tracks.  On 1st listen, I was struck by 'Geenie', then by 'Neverland'(beautiful anthematic final track) and now I find 'Don't Hurt Yourself' to be one of my favorites.  Some tracks on Marbles are musical &quot;worlds within themselves&quot;, such as &quot;Invisable Man&quot; (clever use of synths and organ near the end) and &quot;Ocean Cloud&quot;...this is signiture Marillion.  Other songs venture into new ground such as the single &quot;youre gone&quot;, having more of a U2 feel, however vastly better both musically and vocally.  While I am trepidatious to call any one Marillion album my favorite, I consider this to be a masterwork.  The cherry on top of all this is that Marillion have just announced a North American tour!!!
B000069CWE|5.0|Linkin Park is a wonderful band and the idea of putting out a cd in between your two studio albums is a great idea.  Why they chose to make most of the album have so much of a rap sound I will never know.<BR>With that said, this cd is just all of the songs from the first album (Hyrbid Theory) along with a couple of songs from the LPA and their demos just being remixed.  They are great remixes, but when I went out to buy this cd I was expecting to get another graet rock cd, I was wrong, I just got another decent rap/rock hyrbid cd.<br />Don't get me wrong, this cd is far from being bad... It's just not the LP I have grown to love.  The screaming seems to be missing and replaced with more of Mike Shinoda's rapping.
B000002JSR|4.0|It's hard to review this record.  It's like being asked to review a Picasso that was never exhibited, or a concept car that never touched the road.  There are reasons why these objects were never marketed.<br />With that, I must say that I really like this CD.  I have all of Zep's CDs, including the BBC stuff.  I won't skip any songs when I listen to this one  usually.  \\"Darlene\\" gets skipped from time to time, and maybe \\"Poor Tom.\\"  But \\"We're Gonna Groove,\\" \\"Ozone Baby,\\" \\"Walters Walk\\" and \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" are terrific rock songs.  The version of \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\" on this CD was recorded during a sound check, hours before one of their concerts.  A sound check!!!!  And it sounds unreal!  I'm sorry, but I can't see how anyone could say anything bad about this CD.  It's Zeppelin, and it's the perfect ending to a collective musical career that nearly spanned 3 decades.  Toward the end, we saw a major shift in the band's dynamic; we witnessed Jimmy dive deep into the dimentia of drugs; Robert start and attempt to maintain a family; the resurgence of John Paul and his ability to craft beautiful (but not \\"rock\\") songs; and the death of the most innovative, talented, groovy drummer the rock genre saw to this point in history.  (Say what you will about Neil Peart, Carl Palmer, Dave Grohl, Tony Thompson, Ginger Baker, etc.--none of them remained a STALWART on top of the percussion world as long as this man.)<br />I don't favor the John Paul Jones material that dominated \\"Presence\\" and \\"In Through The Out Door,\\" which may explain my love for \\"Coda.\\"  I think \\"Achilles' Last Stand\\" and \\"Tea For One\\" might be two of Zep's best songs ever, but as albums, \\"Presence\\" and \\"In Through...\\" aren't nearly as strong as earlier, Page/Plant written recordings.  \\"Coda\\" is a mish-mash of earlier outtakes, including a few rare live performances with excellent production quality.  It's one last look at LZ before the John Paul Jones era commenced.  Most are older songs that, for whatever reason, weren't good enough to be included on an album.  That's what it is, and looking at it from that standpoint, it really rocks!  Let's not forget--Physical Graffiti is \\"littered\\" with outtakes, hence the \\"double album\\" presentation.  Nearly half of the tracks on it were either recorded for the \\"Houses\\" album, or weren't destined for any album at all.  Look at the so-called outtakes on that record--they are some of the greatest songs I know, like the tune \\"Houses of the Holy.\\"  Can you believe that the producer convinved them NOT to include that song on the \\"Houses\\" album?  Thank God for \\"Physical Graffiti!\\"<br />This brings me to the whole reason why you should buy this CD.  Anytime one of your favorite bands puts out a \\"Rare 'B' Sides\\" or \\"Outtakes\\" CD, you need to get it.  Know why?  It's a collection of songs that your favorite musicians put together, but some corporate a-hole producer decided that, at that moment, these songs just aren't good enough for the \\"consumer.\\"  From the Cure, the Cult, Nirvana, Cream, Butthole Surfers, Misfits, Metallica, Pink Floyd...it doesn't matter what type of music you're in to: all of these bands have outtake/rare CDs and they all rock in their own particular way.  I'm not saying, \\"buy this only if you're a die hard fan.'  I'm saying, \\"It's Led Zeppelin, it's good, and it's not radio riff-raff, or a couple of guys banging on their tools with the 4-track on 'REC'.\\"  You'll love some of the songs, and you might not enjoy them all, but what are the chances of you picking up a CD without a weak track these days?

B0001ZX0PG|5.0|Clint Eastwood has a trademark it seems of filming a story to become not what it seems. Where the beginning there seems to be a set of &quot;good&quot; guys and &quot;bad&quot; guys, but by the end you don't know who's who. Warning: watch the movie from the beginning and by the end any feelings you have towards a character will be dashed to pieces. It seems like a crime thriller, but actually it isn't even a good crime thriller (for that look at Silence of the Lambs or Se7en). But it is a good tragedy. It reminds me of a Greek drama and a Shakespearean play put together. Think of &quot;Antigone&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot; blended into a contemporary setting.
1566194407|4.0|The Raven, Annabel Lee, Eldorado, The City in the Sea, and The Bells are commonly found in anthologies, but much of Poe's poetry is not widely read today. I enjoyed this inexpensive introduction (published by Barnes and Noble Books) to Poe's poetry, but I was disappointed by the absence of an introduction, footnotes, and commentary. The poems are apparently arranged chronologically from 1827 to 1840; Poe's best known poems are in the latter half.<br /><br />Poe's best poetry is marked by creativity and innovation, sometimes unexpectedly transitioning from a theme of love and beauty to one of despair and death. I consider The City in the Sea, The Sleeper, The Valley of the Unrest, The Haunted Palace, The Conqueror Worm, For Annie, and Annabel Lee to be among the best examples of Poe's imaginative, haunting descriptions of death and dying.<br /><br />Poe's early poetry, and some of his later works, are reminiscent of English romantic poetry.  At his own expense Poe printed his first book, Tamerlane and Other Poems (1827). Poe's style in these earliest poems - Tamerlane, Song, Dreams, Spirits of the Dead, Evening Star, A Dream Within a Dream, Stanzas, A Dream, The Happiest Day --- The Happiest Hour, and The Lake - is characterized by lyrical descriptions, flowery language, and romantic themes.<br /><br />I enjoyed the long poem Tamerlane. Tamerlane (or Tamburlaine, or Timur), a Tartar warrior of the fourteenth century, had amassed an immense empire, and was now reflecting on a distant, but not forgotten, youthful love. Following legend, Poe supposes that Tamerlane was born a lowly peasant, but it is more likely that he was descendant of the famous Khans. (In 1996 the newly independent Uzbekistan celebrated the 660th anniversary of the birth of Timur Khan.)<br /><br />As in The Raven, Poe often employed refrains in later poems. We see Poe experimenting with this poetic technique in one of his earliest efforts, the lyrical poem titled Song. Spirits of the Dead is a contemplative look at death, not a poem of terror. A Dream Within a Dream questions reality itself.<br /><br />I had more difficulty with the lengthy, early poem Al Aaraaf. This romantic fantasy portrays a visitation from a distant world \\"near four bright suns\\" to our lovely Earth, the home of the \\"Idea of Beauty\\".<br /><br />Two poems, An Enigma and A Valentine, challenge the reader to uncover hidden names within the poetry itself. (They reminded me of Poe's secret code in his mystery The Gold Bug.) I have yet to unravel either riddle.poem of terror. A Dream Within a Dream questions reality itself.

B000148KK2|1.0|There has been an enormous amount of analysis about this opus. Some of it quite intelligent and introspective, and on that level, perhaps this album has some merit in stimulating interesting conversation. I do take exception by those who think just because a song was written 50 years ago it's \\"passe\\" or \\"old fashioned\\". Jazz IS classical music in many ways and great songs are great songs no matter when they were written. It is a complex music that displays pure emotion, rich lyric and yet passionate inprovisation which truly separates great talent from the pedestrian. Diana Krall has demonstated she has the ability to sing great jazz. She has the phrasing, the voice and the style within her.     For this collection, however, the highlights are few. The Krall-Costello collaborations are consistantly bland, redundant, static and depressing. What's more, Krall is a JAZZ artist and though it is more profitable to sing songs in the pop world, you must also have a pop talent to pull them off, such as Martha Reeves, Aretha Franklin Sarah McLaughlin or the late the late Dusty Springfield, among many others. Diana Krall excells as a jazz artist and singing pop tunes is obviously very foreign turf for her. This was an interesting experiment, but most of this album is highly forgettable and mundane stuff. I could not imagine listening to this tepid stuff more than once.
6305428042|5.0|I, personally, find this movie to be hilarious.  The acresses are great and very funny.  The whole cast is great.  The story is very funny as well.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually is one of my favorite romantic comedies of the past 10 years, and I'm not overall a big fan of the genre. It ties in a number of storylines that all address love and how it affects people. While there is generally a warm gloss, it really addresses all sorts of relationships. The cast is first rate and the movie ties together well.<br />I wanted to address the twofold criticisms that seem to be depriving this movie of the truly glowing reviews it deserves:<br />-\\"The movie is anti-American.\\" Lighten up. To begin with, it doesn't criticize Americans, but rather arrogant American politicians. Frankly, I think the criticism is on point. The idea behind it isn't to bash America, but to celebrate England as a country that can stand on its own. Hugh Grant's stand brought a smile to my face. And every other American in the film is a sympathetic character. If you're a jingoistic, flag-waving maniac that can't deal with the notion the US ever does anything wrong, then by all means boycott the movie. If you're a normal person that understands all nations have good and bad aspects, then believe me, this movie isn't going to bother you in the least.<br />-\\"Too much sexuality, it detracts from the love theme and family messages.\\" Again, this film was made in Britain. I know this is a shocker for some Americans, but much of the rest of the world isn't so uptight about sexuality. I'd much rather have my kid watch this romantic, soft hearted film than a PG 13 rated action film with non-stop violence. Love and sex go hand in hand. Romantic comedies that avoid sex aren't being very true to what love is. The sex and nudity is done in a classy manner that in no way taints the spirit of the film.<br />By all means, give Love Actually a view. It's a delightful movie.
B000002HH2|5.0|QUOTE: Possibly The Worst Singer In The World! by Cassandra Dongoski. I listened to this C.D. a while back & I almost went deaf this cd is awful this chick can not sing & this album is so freaky & scary!I could barely get through this whole cd! If I could give it zero stars I would! I have never heard of her kind of music it's like she has her own music catergory!If your into freaky & different stuff then you probably will like it! all songs have a outer space sound with weird noises!I don't know what I can recommend to you if you like this except anything Bjork! :UNQUOTE<br />NOW, my turn. I could NOT stop laughing at your atrocious review of an album by one of THE best singers of our time. She has a phenomenal range and a fantastically individual style (<that's a GOOD thing). Not only that, I am painfully aware of the fact that you are terrified of anything different, because you have been brainwashed. Yes. I'm sorry: brainwashed. It happens to all the weak-willed in America (\\"BE THE BEST!\\"). The culprits? Britney Christina and all the other boob flashers and shrill squealers (who, by the way, have to \\"collaborate\\" with the \\"hippest\\" new producers to get a hit).<BR> <BR>Bjork is one of the few artists I have never gotten tired of, because there is always something new to listen out for. Debut can be my favourite some days, and other days my favourite is Homogenic or Vespertine or Post or Telegram (underrated) or Selmasongs. I don't have a set favourite song on this album, however I do love the extreme exmperimentalism of Cover Me. My advice to anyone who has heard this album is to search for the version of Army of Me that Bjork recorded with Skunk Anansie. She goes hell for leather on it and it is gorgeous for those days when you could do with a bit of a scream, but are too exhausted to do so. This review probably won't be helpful to you, but I just like to get things off my chest.
B000002UAI|5.0|While there are quite a few songs sung mostly by Paul, I happen to think the best songs on here are sung by John Lennon.I think Hard Days Night was mostly for the Paul fan but on this early Beatles album Lennon really shines as a vocalist.I think No Reply is a great opening number and Im A Loser is great because its sort of a song about low self esteem which is a cool thing to sing about cause its good to get those dark feelings off your chest.Babys In Black is another really good one and Johns voice is really cool on Rock N Roll Music as well as Mr Moonlight.Words Of Love is a great Buddy Holly cover and I Dont Want To Spoil the party is one of my favorites. I must admit that 2 of the best songs are sung by Paul (Kansas City and Eight Days A Week) but John has always been the coolest Beatle and this is one of the best ones to get if youre a fan of John Lennon.Best early Beatles album ever.

6304696566|5.0|Ethan Edwards, (John Wayne), finds his way home after the civil war to his brothers homestead. Some cattle are rustled and he and a few men track them only to discover it's a Comanche trick to lure them away while they kill out the folks left behind which is Ethan's brother, wife, and kids. They arrive back too late, all are dead except Ethan's niece who was taken captive. Ethan sets out to find his niece accompanied by Martin Pauley, (Jeffrey Hunter), who Ethan found as a baby years earlier after another Indian raid. Ethan loved his brother's wife which is clear in the book by Lemay but very lightly alluded to in the film. This helps to explain his rage because everything he cared for in the world is gone. He will pursue the Comanche that have his niece until hell freezes over. Along the way he finds that he is still a human being. This film is considered by some as the greatest western of all time and a favorite film of Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg if that means anything to you, I thought I would toss it in anyway.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is simply one of the most beautiful films ever shot.  The intricate precision used in crafting each and every scene is flawless.  Whether you liked this film or not, any serious film student should analyze every detail in this movie.<br />What makes this movie so likable, in my opinion, is its aray of unique and 'real' characters.  So many films try to forget that we are all the 'hero' and the 'villian' in our own life story.  Our perception of mean and hateful people are just as easily perceived as kind and joyful by other people in other situations.  What we lack in our mundane everyday lives is the ability to understand and perceive the emotions and motives of other people.  And this movie shows us that in a gradual, very subtle way.....then turns it up strong near the end just in case you haven't yet caught the message.  <br />Lester Burnham was a man that finally discovered what life was all about.  He broke out of his mundane world and started speeding toward all his hopes and dreams accomplishing so much along the way.  At last when he understands what happiness really means to him....is when he truly achieved it.  But there's hope to those who failed to see the important message in this movie; as Lester Burnham said, &quot;If you don't know what I'm talking about, don't worry.  You will someday.&quot;  You can actually hear the smile in his voice.
B000003TA4|4.0|I'm not gonna yell around about how people who don't like Nirvana don't recognize music and whatever.  If you don't like it, you know, go your own way.  Now, I'd like to say that if your glad Kurt died cause &quot;he was a loser&quot;, well, you're the loser.  Anyone who wishes ill of another is a &quot;loser.&quot;  Also, just cause no one knows what SLTS, or any of the songs, &quot;mean&quot;, doesn't mean they're not music or art.  Picasso didn't neccesarily &quot;mean&quot; anything with his art, yet it goes without a doubt that he was a great artist.  This album is chock full of terrific music, with only 1 bad song: On A Plain.  I mean, who can complain?  Also, Kurt could play guitar, he just wasn't as good as some.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|I recently bought &quot;Want One&quot; by Rufus Wainwright and after a few listens, I was absolutely addicted.  I've listened to the album too many times to count and it has never gotten old.  I bought his other albums soon after and loved those just as much.  Wainwright has extraordinary talent and his musical style is completely unique.  There is absolutely no one like him.  So if you're a lover of music and innovation, you have to buy &quot;Want One&quot; or any of his other albums!
1400079179|4.0|In many ways THE DA VINCI CODE was similar to ANGELS AND DEMONS.  Both books start off a little slowly, but if you persevere, the pace picks up and, it seems like each chapter is more exciting. The main character is Robert Langdon, an American professor from Harvard.  His field is Semiotics, the study and theory of signs and symbols,<br /><br />Author Dan Brown takes on the Opus Dei organization along with another ancient secret society whose members were supposed to be some of the greatest men of the world, including Sir Isaac Newton and Leonardo da Vinci. The story begins in France where Robert Langdon is on a lecture tour.  He's due to meet with a famous museum curator when the police advise him that the curator was killed.  The man's body is laid out, in what appears to be a ritualistic fashion.  Robert assumes that the police want his expertise in helping to solve the murder, but he's warned by Sophie Neveu, a French Cryptologist, that the police believe that Robert is the killer.  Because of information that she's received, she knows that he's innocent.  Robert and Sophie team up to solve the mystery which leads them into amazing and mind boggling discoveries.<br /><br />This author writes fascinating action fiction that keeps you interested and wanting to know more; however, his characters are a little bland. The exception is Lee, a wealthy Englishman who is also an expert in ancient symbols. I found him to be engaging and the most arresting character in the story.<br /><br />Judith Miller

B00005JKLZ|3.0|This is watchable action/adventure, with competent acting and effects. It just never rises past the ordinary, though. Also, though I haven't read Welles' original in some time, I have doubts about its faithfulness to the original.<br />The plot is simple enough. Brilliant but obsessed scientist suffers a terrible loss, then creates the time machine to go back and recover what was lost. When that doesn't work, he skips forward through time, and an accident lands him in the distant futre. Mankind has split into two subspecies, the peaceful, pastoral Eloi and the vicious (and a little more technologically oriented) Morlocks. Our hero saves the world and lives happily every after. [Vague, I know, but I prefer to avoid spoilers.]<br />The steam-punk look of the time machine is well done. The look of the Eloi village is distinctive, but very reminiscent of the Myst games. There was interesting continuity of the traveler's steps into the future, including the one character that reappears in different eons.<br />A few things left me confused, though. The Morlocks use blowguns with some vile mix in the darts. As near as I can tell, though, the only effect of a dart is to leave a black stain - I never did see toxic effects in the people hit by them. Also, a relatively small nuclear blast was enough to break up the moon. Huh? You don't need to be a physicist here. Some of those lunar craters came from meteor impacts that released the energy of nuclear blasts, big ones, and the moon held up just fine. Breaking up the moon would mean overcoming the gravitational attraction that holds all the pieces together. No human bomb is anywhere near that energy range.<br />It's a decent enough way to kill an evening. Just be sure you want it dead.
6305313687|5.0|How terrifying is it while listening to some of Edward Norton's rants in this movie....that you actually begin to understand his point of view on things?  That's a very important aspect of this film.  The hatred spewing from his mouth along with statistical evidence and insightful rhetoric places the viewer amist what seems to be an actual white supremicist rally.  It becomes easy to see how so many fall into crowds like this with characters like the fictional Derrick Vinyard preaching to the masses.  Many people don't like the way the world around them is.  They're looking for a  change.  People like Vinyard offer a path to that change.<br />But this story is mainly about redemption.  The redemption of the character in question, Derrick Vinyard.  Only after he loses everything can he begin to see the horrible path that he has beaten for his younger brother who is speedily chasing after him.  The unlikely friendship with a black prison inmate and the tutalage of his former principle are what helps him return to his humanity.  The simple yet distanced solution to all the hatred and anger that he's felt most of his life comes like an epiphany:  \\"It's just not worth it.\\"  A point that he vehemently drives into those around him.<br />Be forwarned, this is not a happy story.  The ending is tragic yet depressingly real.  Hatred becomes a vicious circle.
B000000H66|5.0|Almost perfect. Goes all the way through without one bad song.Amazing guitar work! Amazing drums! There is yet to be a out a better album and maybe there never will. 5+ stars
B00001QEFU|5.0|This is probly the best Twisted Sister album made. The songs are heavy and pissed off. The standout songs are &quot;bad boys of rock n roll&quot;, &quot;sin after sin&quot;, &quot;shoot em down&quot; and &quot;Tear it Loose&quot;. &quot;what you don't know, sure can hurt you&quot; does'nt sound right in the studio thought<br />never the less, this is a great kick ass Rock album, If your an SMF you need this.
B0001AVZA8|1.0|I wasn't expecting the best romantic comedy in the world but I was hopeful that this one might be reasonably entertaining.  Instead, I found it embarrassing and deadly.  I am not a fan of Diane Keaton but I didn't expect her to be this bad.  Her character behaved like a melodramatic teenager and the crying scene was idiotic and interminable.  Jack Nicholson was his usual lecherous, boozy-looking over-the-hill lothario and it was very hard to believe that any woman of any age would go so nutsy over him, especially with Reeves waiting in the wings (also an incredible premise in these circumstances). Even Frances McDormand, who is always good, could not do much to help out as her character was severely underwritten.  It was a relief when this movie was over.
B00004Z459|4.0|well first off all i got to say is damn this CD is great, best i've ever heard, Linkin Park is a very talented band, some people out there take Linkin Park as a no just cause they rap, well as long as they got guitars in it and singing then i like it, it's probably the only rapping i like, i don't care much for raps like Limp Bizkit, they just don't have the style that Linkin Park does. My favorite song on this album would probably be Crawling and One Step Closer, those two songs are great, very talented how Chester held his voice like that in Crawling, awesome. All i got to say is don't take Linkin Park for granted just cause it has rap in it, that stuff on MTV is what you ought to hate, no doubt about it, Linkin Park has rap which sounds great with Chester's loud voice. Anything other than that i give it 4 stars for this album just a few songs i didn't like very much, In The End, i didn't like that one very much, and Forgotten thought it had to much rap in it or it would be alright. In other words i recommend this album buy it, trust me you will be surprised how good it is.
B000002GD9|5.0|Supertramp is a fascinating group.It shows on all of their albums.Including this one of course.Inspite of Give A Little Bit being the only song I've heard on the radio,the rest of the album is worth listening to as well.My favourite tracks are Give A Little Bit,Lover Boy,Even In The Quietest Moments,From Now On and Fool's Overture.When I first heard the title track(Even In The Quietest Moments),I thought it was Rick Davies singing,until his voice got higher enough that I realised it was Roger Hodgeson.Fool's Overture is probably my most favourite track.I love how this track seems to be a variety of different songs and sound effects combined,including music that is now known as the instramental theme of the TV show W5.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think &quot;Under My Skin&quot; by Avril is one of the best pop rock cds i've ever heard. From the melodies to her lyrics, i just can't even describe. I'm recommending anyone and everyone to buy this cd. I think its the BEST!!!!!!!!!!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|\\"Cold Mountain\\" is one of those few movies, that I say is beautiful and gorgeous. I give a movie this title, if is if flawless, and \\"Cold Mountain\\" is. There is not a thing that I would change about this movie. The cinematography, costumes, direction, writing, story, and acting are perfect. Jude Law is the perfect choice to play Inman, his quiet intensity truly conveys the horror of war, and the effects on soldiers. Nicole Kidman was a surprising choice as Ada, but does a marvelous job. She is convincing, and deserved and Oscar nomination. But the true star of this film is Renee Zelwegger. She deserved her Oscar for this movie in every way. Her role of Ruby Thewes, was completely amazing. She made me laugh, she made me cry, she truly moved me. This is one amazing film, and was the best movie of 2003!
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Oh my god what a long boring movie. And it wasn't even that original either! I kept getting the feeling when watching it that I'd seen it before, but it was called something else and had different characters. The only thing good about this movie is the cast. They could have easily done this movie with no-name actors and it wouldn't have been any worse (or any better), it just wouldn't have gotten so much hub-bub. I can't believe they managed to get a 3 dvd set of this crap movie. what extras they could have possibly come up with to fill up two extra dvd's are far beyond my imagination.<br />Basically, this guys daughter gets murdered, and the whole movie revolves around these three guys who were friends as kids. One of them turned into the detective who's investigating the murder, one of them was the father of the murder victim, and the other guy everybody thinks was the guy who did it. Two of the guys kind of stayed in touch over the years, but the detective guy really didn't stay friends with any of them. So what it turns into is a stupid boring 4 hour (seemed like it) drama about how these guys get &quot;thrown&quot; back into each others lives. I could tell you the story in 10 seconds. They just add all kinds of stupid filler to it to just make it more dramatic. Like some kid getting abused as a child, another deaf kid and his relationship with his two brothers. Just stupid boring FILLER.
B0000T6JH4|5.0|I find this an interesting collector's item.Though I can't hear any differences in most of the songs.The only three that do sound different are Let It Be,The Long And Winding Road and Across The Universe.I especially find Across The Universe to be sung in a higher key and sound slightly more cheerful.
B000255LIY|3.0|One correction for a previous review. JULIE Harris was not in the Broadway production of \\"Lion In Winter\\". It was another wonderful actress, ROSEMARY Harris.<br />One other interesting piece of casting, it was an early role for Christopher Walken as the King of France.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|A clear attempt to change by slipknot is more than successful in there third album.  It reaches new levels of musical ability and achievement in all areas.  Mick and Jim on guitars play some sick deep rhythem tracks and shed some sweet guitar solos.  Drums and custum percussion are better then slipknot has ever shown.  Bass and the DJ section are awesome. Coreys vocals and lyrics are amazing. He has truly been opened up by stone sour.  However, I disagree with anyone who says that they sound like stone sour.  Also contrary to popular belief, I do not feel this was slipknot's attempt to go radio friendly, I truly believe that they are just reaching new levels of musical expression.  The songs are catchy and new, but still have the old vibe.  They get incredibly heavy, and also slow and soft with acoustic songs one would never expect from them.  Slipknot has truly developed musicianship in creating what i would call none other then a flawless display of Hard Rock. The subliminal verses is a definete great buy.
0385510438|1.0|Bought the book in February and just finally forced myself to finish it last night. (It looked so lonely on my nightstand, watching piles of more interesting and well written books come and go.)Why did it take me so long to read this particular Grisham work? Because this book lacked the page turning quality of his previous works. The narrative arc was shaky at best, with the ending a shoot'em up let down. Be warned -- many characters waltz in and out of the story, lots of wacky over the top stereotypical southern names to keep track of.  I did enjoy the author's thinly veiled attack on WalMart -- he did an excellent job of explaining the damage caused to small town economies by  WalMart stores.
B000002GEY|5.0|Breakfast In America is one of my all time favourite albums.I've had it on record ever since I was nine years old,back when the album first came out in 1979.I believe this to be their best album ever.I know all the songs off by heart.One thing that fascinates me about this group,is how Roger Hodgeson and Rick Davies have always alternated in lead vocals.You can tell their voices apart,but they both do equally great songs.You'll notice how side 1 begins with a song where Rick sings lead,then followed by a Roger song,then the next song we're back to Rick,and so on.Side 2 begins with two Roger songs,the first one being his ever popular Take The Long Way Home,the next two songs are from Rick,the last song titled Child Of Vision,Rick and Roger sing together.Interesting track pattern.No Supertramp collection would be complete without Breakfast In America.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Joss Wedon has yet again produced an amazing group of characters with a riveting story line.  Packed with action and great humour, there is no way you can consider this boring.  Pity the show was cancelled but thank goodness some lovely people decided to make a movie.  Hopefully this will kick the network that axed it into continuing the series.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Purple was the first time I had heard of Stone Temple Pilots, and then I listened to the rest, becoming an instant fan. What this album does is abandon the Core sound and really gets into that grunge mode, but they do it gracefully, and looking back, everyone knows they succeeded. This did not intend to compare with what Nirvana was doing, producing some good catchy tunes like Meatplow, Vasoline, Big Empty, and of course, Interstate Love Song. It belongs in every music fan's CD collection. Nuff said.
6304712936|5.0|I just watched this movie yesterday, and I am still in awe.  I have never been a huge fan of classical music, and I'm sure if I was I would have liked it even more, but I certainly enjoyed it immensely.<br />There were some incredibly powerful scenes, my favorite being the one toward the end where Mozart is dictating the funeral mass to Salieri, and the music starts in the background as he is composing it.  Brilliant!<br />My one complaint is a small one, and that is the casting of Tom Hulce as Mozart.  In the production notes it said that the director did not want well-known actors, because it would distract the audience, who would say &quot;that's just Tom Cruise (or whomever) playing Mozart.&quot;  But in the first few minutes of the movie all I could keep thinking was &quot;where do I know this guy from???&quot;  And then I remembered.  Animal House.  I could think of 5-6 better casting choices off the top of my head, but I have to admit, over the course of the film, Hulce did seem to grow into the role.<br />Overall, a wonderful experience.  Highly recommended!
B000002UDB|5.0|The Magical Mystery Tour is another one of my all time favourite albums.I even have the movie on VHS.By the late 60s,even The Beatles began experimenting with drugs.You can hear it in most of these songs.I find Blue Jay Way to be a creepy spooky sounding song.It has an intense,even nerve wracking sound to it.The famous song All You Need Is Love is also included at the end of the album.Apparently nobody knows which Beatle is dressed in what costume on the album cover.
1400032717|5.0|It was perfectly fitting that author Mark Haddon wrote this book, as he worked with autistic children in his earlier years and his background and experiences in this field must have greatly contributed to the believability of this story, even though it is an incredible tale. I was deeply fascinated by the gifted though autistic teenage boy Christopher in this story of false accusation and a boy unable to defend himself and explain his innocence, but CAN try to prove it. This was a highly enjoyable, very fast-paced, and at times moving and funny read. Highly recommended.<br />David Rehak<BR>author of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;
6305508550|5.0|That this movie is one of the best comedies ever?  I have managed to make every person I work with watch this movie.  It is so true to life, and you know and understand every single personality in the movie that I think it should be considered a classic.  There is a classic quote in almost every scene, and believe me, I say them all the time.  I was also thrilled to see Gary Cole in this movie.  I thought him talented way back in his &quot;Midnight Caller&quot; days.  He has even more talent than I gave him credit for.  He will give anyone the heebie jeebies, and will make you want to wash after seeing a scene he is in.  Ron Livingston is the great every man, and as always Jennifer Aniston plays another &quot;Rachel&quot; kind of character in this movie.  Aside from her, it is a pitch perfect cast and I watch it whenever I'm having a &quot;case of the Mondays&quot;.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|1st off the 1st CD was great, 2nd cd was good (it had it's great moments though) and this new cd is ok. Seems like they have digressed to me over the years. Corey doesnt sing (scream) with conviction like before. I guess all that screaming can take it's tolll on you after a while! But much like IOWA, this new cd has it's shining moments, just not enough for me to put it in the same catagory as the 1st release.
B000002UAU|5.0|One of my all time favourite albums.I love the sound of it from beginning to end.No Beatles album collection would be complete without this album.
B0000027RL|5.0|seriously.your reviews are worthless.you and your buddies are nothing.amazon always bans the people the against you but never ban you and your buddies.that's not fair.
B00003CXXP|2.0|This movie isn't terrible but because it comes from two great directors, the bar must be raised a bit.  At it's back-bone, the movie relies on a series of plot-points that are contrived to push your emotional buttons.  The first is when the robot designers claim that the big question when designing a robot is &quot;will it be loved&quot; - oh, please.  This is NOT the &quot;big question&quot; in brain AI development.  The real &quot;big questions&quot; are ones like: &quot;will an AI brain develop a soul&quot; and &quot;what are the moral implications of shutting off an AI brain.  The question of love is just a typical application of &quot;Spielberg's special sauce&quot; to make you cry in the end.<br />Next, the imprinting burn-in - another rediculous contrivance.  An AI brain as sophisticated as the boy's would behave like a real boy. It would develop attachment like an orphan adopted into a family - over time by mental imprinting - not some half-baked process like entering your serial number whilst installing Photoshop.<br />Now, remember that the parents signed up for this experimental robot-boy with the &quot;Dad's&quot; company.  Why then did the &quot;mom&quot; dump the boy in the forest?  Didn't she realise that the company was going to wonder where their $80 billon robot was?  Why couldn't she just give it back to the company?  Maybe because this begs the very interesting question, &quot;what are they going to do with it then?&quot;  But this movies carefully avoids these and other interesting questions.<br />What about the robot hunters?  Why are they flying in a futuristic balloon?  Why not one of the many cool flying cars in the movie?  And how about their &quot;futuristic&quot; bounty-hunter lingo?  Is this cliché dialog Spielberg or Kubric?  I guess it doesn't matter - it's bad both ways.<br />Let's jump to the end.  The ET-looking-people have travelled the countless zillions of light-years, settled on the earth, and can bring &quot;Mom&quot; back tolife but only for 1 day!  This is the final blow.  After witnessing this, I felt used.<br />CONCLUSION:<br />Instead of being achieving a kind of gestalt effect, &quot;AI&quot; suffers from it's association with both of it's great directors. It not only fails to address REAL questions of AI, it avoids them.  The periodic introduction of contrivances makes it painful and sometimes laughable to watch.  There is really no end to the movie.  It just kind of slows to a full and complete stop.
B00006IR5S|3.0|The music is pretty good, but the tracks go out of order when compared to the movie, which bugs me so much that I never listen to this.
B000002UB6|5.0|Inspite of the negative reputation this album seems to have,I've always liked it.It's worth listening to.The first track Two Of Us is a pretty happy fun sounding song.Though as much as I like Across The Universe,I rather liked the original wildlife fund version better.The version on this album sounds kind of sad.Let It Be and Get Back are probably the most popular songs from this album.I haven't seen the Let It Be movie.I'd like to someday.I like the way you often hear the band members make comments and joke around in between tracks.
0385510438|1.0|This has been the worst book from Grisham than I have ever read. It was a waisting time. Page after page I was expecting things change or come better but  at the end I was dissapointed with this book. I should read the amazon rate before buy this book. I'll do next time.
078322611X|1.0|Not an emotionally authentic moment in this movie.  It's scary, and tells you a lot about America, that so many moviegoers are bowled over by this treacle.  No wonder the booboisie want to put Ronald Reagan's mug on Mt. Rushmore.  They fall for anything.
B00018D44U|1.0|YAAAWWWWWWWWNNNNNNNNN!!!!......<BR>Oh is the CD over yet??<BR>I can't believe how boring this one is.  I can't tell if it's the first or the second album.  Here is one of the most overrated artists ever.  It's not original, it's not entertaining and her voice isn't that good.  So I ask, what's with all the hoopla??!!!!!<BR>Avoid ladies and gents.
B00004SGNM|5.0|I just love everything about Cyndi Lauper.Her music takes me back to my teen years.Especially this album filled with such memorable rock songs.I remember seeing the video for Time After Time,and I cried my eyes out.Girls Just Want To Have Fun seems to be everyone's favourite.Cyndi is so colourful that all her colour seems to spread all over everything she does.I loved her video for She Bop.Another favourite of mine is All Through The Night.There's something special about the sound of that song.Definetly one of the best albums from the 80s.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|What annoys me is overly critical people who think the only point of a review is to compare bands to other bands...Why do they listen to music that's obviously in the same genre, just to criticize it for being the same genre? Anyway...<br />I liked the Franz Ferdinand Cd. The catchy beats and guitar riffs made me wanna dance, and I thought it was original, even if it was '80s-influenced. My favorites were &quot;Jaqueline&quot;, &quot;Take me out&quot;, &quot;Matinee&quot;, &quot;Darts of Pleasure&quot; and &quot;40'&quot;. I liked most of the songs on the CD. I kinda thought &quot;come on home&quot; sounded too similar to the other songs. As the reviews show, this CD probably is not for everyone. But I liked it, and that's really all that matters to me.
B00006CXSS|5.0|That's part of the speech attributed to Henry V by William Shakespeare. This is about the men of Easy Company, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division.<BR>It begins on June 5, 1944, (the day  originally chosen by Eisenhower to be D-Day,) but just before they're supposed to make their jump into France, they're ordered to stand down due to the weather. They go the next day. Then it goes to when the 501st was formed. The men of Easy Company<BR>had it rough. Nobody said that war was easy. It's a long, hard, slog through mud, snow, and tropical heat. However, since this is the ETO, (European Theater of Operations,) that this miniseries deals with, there aren't any jungles in Europe. General William T. Sherman, the famous Civil War<BR>commander, said it best. I can't think of a more fitting way to<BR>end this review than with Sherman's quote about war. &quot;War,<BR>gentlemen, is hell!&quot;
B00003CX9E|4.0|This 2 disc dvd reveals the underbelly of a rather ugly part of american history.  Kind of similar to how Chicago is based upon fact (rather ugly fact), so is Citizen Kane based upon fact.  Both discs in this dvd are historically wickedly cool.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is the strangest album The Beatles ever made.I don't mean that in a critical way or as a put down.The bizarre sound of this album in general,is what makes it special.Listening to it is like going on a phychedelic joy ride,an adventure.Obla Di Obla Da,While My Guitar Gently Weeps,Blackbird,I Will,and Birthday are probably the most familiar tunes.I believe this was also the band's first album to feature the Apple label.I'm So Tired was apparently based on the pressure John had been under,having to decide whether he should divorce his wife Cynthia to marry Yoko Ono.Don't Pass Me By was in fact the first song that Ringo had written and composed all on his own.Then we have Revolution 1,which is the first version of John's hit song Revolution.You can definetly tell these two versions apart.Revolution 9,the second last track on the album,is in no relation to the Revolution song at all.It's not even a song.What it is,is a whole variety of sound effects mixed together.Practically the wierdest part of the whole album.The final track titled Good Night is a beautiful song with a sound quite unlike any other track on the album somehow.In fact,to me it sounds like something out of a Walt Disney cartoon.Still,this is among my favourite Beatles albums.
B000008HPE|5.0|In eighty seven, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is hip to be square, a song so catchy, most people don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's a personal statement about the band itself.
B000007R1M|5.0|It's now been 26 years since Kraftwerk released &quot;The Man Machine&quot;, the second of the classic trilogy of albums started with 1977's &quot;Trans Europe Express&quot; and concluded with 1981's &quot;Computer World&quot;. I'm gonna have to disagree with the London reviewer a couple of reviews below, and believe that the album has clearly stood the test of time. In my opinion, Kraftwerk synthesized everything here, and this album noses out &quot;Computer World&quot; as their best ever.<br />&quot;The Man Machine&quot; (6 tracks, 36 min.) can be divided up in 3 parts: (1) the singles &quot;The Model&quot; and &quot;The Robots&quot; are irresistable (I remember being in France the summer of '78 when this just came out and the discos were blasting &quot;The Robots&quot;, make sure you crank up the volume on this one); (2) the (mostly) instrumentals &quot;Spacelab&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; are nice; (3) the most important, and best, tracks are the 2 last: &quot;Neon Lights&quot; is mostly instrumental, with an incredible hypnotizing outro, just amazing; and the title track is a dark, yet highly &quot;robotic&quot; danceable song that sums up the album perfectly.<br />At 36 min., there is not a second, not a moment wasted. How many albums can make that claim? Also, if you haven't checked out &quot;Tour de France Soundtracks&quot;, Kraftwerk's 2003 'come-back' album, make sure to do so. It is a delight, unexpectedly so in my opinion after a 17 year break.
B0000VD04M|5.0|I'd heard good things about Ed Wood from critics, and decided to rent it to see for myself. After all, most of the movies I enjoy the most are movies that are panned viciously by said critics. Guess what? for once, I agreed with the \\"screen snobs\\" and enjoyed this movie just as much as the ones normally dismissed by the critics.<br />Johnny Depp is brilliant as the ever optimistic, supremely untalented Ed Wood. It is strange to contemplate the irony that it took such a top notch director, cast and writer to honor someone like Ed. <br />Speaking of brilliant, don't miss Martin Landau's Oscar winning turn as Bela Lugosi. By turns hilariously profane and poignantly troubled, Landau earned his Oscar for this part.<br />I just wish the powers that be at the studios would hurry up and put this gem on DVD so that we can all enjoy it!
B000002GJ7|5.0|Extreme's sophomore release, &quot;Pornograffitti,&quot; is one of the most astounding pieces of rock music I have ever heard.  It may be a biased statement (as Nuno Bettencourt is my favorite guitarist of all time), but the riffs and solos on this album have an energy to them that I cannot describe... If you are a guitarist, I promise you will be impressed with Nuno's playing... And even if you aren't, there is still just something about this album that is so unprecedented for its time (1990).  The music flows so incredibly well as only Nuno and company could make it.  I listen to every song on this album except #9.  Not that it isn't good, it just doesn't fit with the album. (It is a song played on piano and sung by Nuno Bettencourt)  The only downfall about this album, and it is an extremely minor one, is that the music tends to sound a little cheesy and 80's-esque in some parts.  But most people will be so incredibly amazed by the rest of the music that this minute flaw will not matter.  That is how most rock music sounded in the late 80's, early 90's anyway. I would recommend this album to anyone who loves good, solid, guitar-driven rock and roll music.  By the way, Gary Cherone's voice is also breath-taking.  Also recommended: Extreme's III Sides to Every Story
B0001932ZA|3.0|This overly predictable sci-fi/action yarn (based on a story by Stephen King which he wrote under the pen name Richard Bachman) stars good 'ol Arnie as a wrongfully accused man forced to fight for his life on a TV game show in the year 2017.  Former Family Feud game show host Richard Dawson is great as the slimy evil game show host, and the rest of the cast includes Maria Conchita Alonso (as a love interest who believes Arnie's innocence), and the late Yapphet Kotto as one of Arnie's pals.  However, the Running Man warrants new viewing today, just to see future governors Arnie and Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura bash heads.  Oh the irony.  Artisan decided to release a &quot;Special Edition&quot; version of the film, but why in the heck does it have to be on 2 discs?  The extras are minimal and one disc would have served it's purpose, plus such features like the Lockdown on Mainstreet and Game Theory documentaries are pure fluff.  All in all, if you own the single disc edition, don't feel the need to upgrade.
B00005B364|4.0|\\"...but you are still in commotion.\\" This title track is in the standard 1970s prog mode, so much that they could have optioned it to ELP and no one would have been the wiser. Thijs Van Leer's vocals are so similar to that of Greg Lake and his piano work on this cut so good a good imitation of Emerson's that it could have been the B-side of \\"Lucky Man\\", being that \\"Take a Pebble\\" is too long for that purpose. At the same time, the track \\"Hocus Pocus\\" sounds like standard hard rock, were it not for the tongue in cheek interludes that contain yodeling on one and scat singing on another that sounds like the type Popeye the Sailor used to do as he walked along. Who said prog artists take themselves too seriously to fit into the fun side of rock? A longer version than the radio track is included here. The epic \\"Eruption\\" (which was the entire side 2 on the LP version) comes across as an answer to the title suite on the ELP album \\"Tarkus\\", except that there isn't much in the way of dynamics here--the whole thing is pretty much the same level throughout. There are more recurrances of the main theme than on \\"Tarkus\\" here--they pop in and out the way the \\"Promenade\\" theme does in Moussorgsky's \\"Pictures At an Exhibition\\". The only complaints I have are the serial tracks \\"Focus\\" and \\"Anonymous\\", which reappear throughout the Focus discography with different Roman numerals. Unfortunately they are more restatements of versions up to that point than continuations. It would be a bad idea to do tape or MP3 dubs and string each set together--the redundancy would drive you up the wall.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|Basically, this movie shows how two up-and-coming directors can stray from their roots and adopt the Hollywood system.  They sold out at a level on par with only the likes of George Lucas, although they sold out much, much faster.<br />The third movie is basically a whole lot of prolonged, bad scenes that ultimately lead to a completely worthless conclusion that does absolutely nothing for the series and fails to resolve any of the huge issues raised in the first and second installments.  <br />The worst part of all of this is that the ONLY reason the Wachowski brothers went with an ending of this type is because they want to cash in on The Matrix Online, which they are helping to make and is supposed to continue the franchise's story.  So basically the only reason that this crap was laid out before us was so that the Wachowskis could make another bad video game, only this time I imagine no one will buy it.<br />If you're into fake-looking visual effects, terrible acting, pointless narratives, and the like, then by all means, pick up this movie.  Otherwise, watch something good.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|Don't waste your time with this movie, see another movie instead. There is no Tim Burton magic in this film. Look at how many used copies are for sale, and you'll understand what I mean.
B00005JLWN|5.0|The box says, &quot;Forget The Matrix!&quot;  There's no way around a comparing the two.  In many ways, I say this one is better.  Yes, better!  This movie hooks you in the first 10 minutes and keeps you there.  The movie has a well thought out plot and the action is &quot;Off The Chain!&quot;  They fight with guns like I never saw before.  I highly recommend this one.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Awesome album.  I love everything about it, thanks for putting your heart and soul into it Avril, that's awesome.
B00025ETIW|5.0|To sum it all up in one word-beautiful. But I can't get away with that! My Chemical Romance releases a slightly more upper than their previous debut (word is Gerard is in therapy) that's so unbelievably energetic its impossible to contain yourself while listening to it. The blended elements of pop punk and screamo/post-hardcore are so effective that I simply dare you not to start moving when you hear the first tune. Lyrically it's a trip through a disturbed mind, which is odd considering how unbelievably catchy and melodic the vocals tend to be-of course there's the requisite scream here and there. Maybe its guitarist Ray Toro's huge hair but there's some slightly retro here, way deep down beyond everything else rooted in the mix. They certainly never relent on the sing-a-long choruses and funny song titles-\\"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us In Prison\\" and \\"It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish\\" take the cake. Without a doubt this will be a favorite for most and high on \\"best album\\" lists for 2004, while the buddyhead's out there will laugh and say how horrible it is. Oh to be cool.
B0001DI0FI|4.0|Despite some earnest attempts, the confrontations between Aubrey and Maturin just aren't that gripping, and while Crowe brings charisma and stature to his role, he's rather hard to empathize with. That said, Master and Commander still succeeds admirably thanks to its wealth of exciting action sequences and meticulous detail. Fans of the age of sail will be well rewarded.<br />If you liked this film, be sure to check out the Horatio Hornblower movies, based on the other classic series of Napoleonic naval warfare books, those by C.S. Forester. The Hornblower films may lack the massive budget of Weir's production, but the attention to detail is just as convincing and, more importantly, the characters are much richer and more likeable.

B0001ZX0OM|1.0|what a load of crap! i dont know who bribed who but this DID NOT deserve an Oscar! the whole storyline is just absurdly terrible and i dont understand how anyone can think this was a great movie! Mystic River is on the list of MOST HORRIBLE MOVIES EVER, and at the top of the list along with Insomnia(i felt horrible that robin Williams would do such a terrible movie]. these 2 movies expecially made me cringe with disgust
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I knew that I wanted to see/hear Wicked as soon as I heard the words Kristen Chenowith, but it was Idina Menzel that blew me away.  I loved all of Kristen's numbers, but I knew that I would...with her amazing range that I came to love in her CD &quot;Let Yourself Go&quot;.  Not to mention her countless other musical additions to her resume.  Close your eyes during &quot;Popular&quot; and you can see little dynamo wowing everyone with her voice.  You can hear the smile in her voice.  It was  Idina that captured me completely though...I had ignorantly never heard of her.  But her voice in such songs as Defying Gravity and No Good Deeds takes listeners to another level.  Honestly it made me want to re-watch The Wizard of Oz, and root for Elphaba.  Buy this CD, and support Broadway!!
B00004Z459|5.0|Hey its LP #1 fan Lynette here just to tell ya all that if you are a LP fan too { get this cd } IT ROCKS !!!!!!.

B00009V7RF|5.0|Elephunk is the third CD from the Peas, and although some would criticize them for becoming commercially successful, I'd have to say this is their best album yet.  This is the first album with Fergie, who provides vocals that join with Wills, apl's, and Taboo's rapping perfectly.  I rate the songs as follows:<br />1- Hands Up           4.5/ 5<BR>2- Labor Day          5  / 5<BR>3- Let's Get Retarded 5+ / 5  One of my favorites on the album<BR>4- Hey Mama           5  / 5<BR>5- Shut Up            3  / 5  Catchy at first, EXTREMELY annoying after a few listens.  The only song on the album I skip.<BR>6- Smells Like Funk   5  / 5  <BR>7- Latin Girls        5+ / 5  Another of my favorites<BR>8- Sexy               4.5/ 5  <BR>9- Fly Away           5  / 5  A great song that really showcases Fergie's vocals, which also samples \\"Fallin' Up' from the Peas' first CD<BR>10- The Boogie That Be 5++/5  My overall favorite on the album<BR>11- The Apl Song      5  / 5  <BR>12- Anxiety           4  / 5 The only rock song on the CD, it features Papa Roach... could have been better.<BR>13- Where Is The Love? 5 / 5  While it is good, this is not the best song by the Peas...<BR>14 (Hidden Track) 4.5/  5  Consisting mainly of Fergie and Will, it was a solid song, but I thought it was a little too long and boring.<br />Overall, you should definitely pick up this CD, whatever type of music fan you are.  Prior to Elephunk, I had never listened to rap, but I'm so glad that this introduced me to such a talented genre.  5 stars+++! :)
B00005JLEX|5.0|I was at Jerry Seinfeld's Las Vegas show on June 11.  After his set, he took some questions from the audience as his 'encore'.  Someone asked him about the DVD set of the series, and he said a November release was planned (he even joked about it coming in time for the Christmas season).  He said the reason for the delay was that they were doing a lot of background and bonus materials, which I guess was his way of saying he was negotiating his compensation for those materials.  Either way, I can't wait for the set.  No one asked how many seasons would be coming out, but I would imagine they would release one season at a time to maximize sales, like the Simpsons is doing.
630512762X|5.0|Place this modern action classic up there with DIE HARD, SPEED, and THE NEGOTIATOR as one of my personal favorite action films.<br />Before watching FACE/OFF completely, I had taken a look at one of director John Woo's Hong Kong action epics, THE KILLER. I must say, I prefer FACE/OFF better. Sure, both films have that same over-the-top operatic style, but at least FACE/OFF isn't as shamelessly sentimental as THE KILLER was. In THE KILLER, Woo's main characters both demolished hundreds of extras in graphically bloody style, and towards the end it got a bit too much even for me. In FACE/OFF, the gore isn't quite as graphic, and while the body count is still pretty high, it never got to the point that I was disgusted.<br />I'm not a knee-jerk admirer of John Woo as some people are. That slow-motion technique of his can become wince-inducingly excessive, especially now that many lesser action directors have started to rip off his style. In this case, though, one is too engrossed in the plot and in awe of the high-energy action staging to notice. <br />Of course, most people probably already have an idea of what the plot is about: criminal Castor Troy (Nicolas Cage) dies, but he has planted a bomb somewhere in LA, so obsessive detective Sean Archer (John Travolta) literally swaps identities with his arch-nemesis to go undercover at a high-tech prison to find out where that bomb is. Obviously, this situation leads to various complications as Troy wakes up from his coma, takes Archer's face, kills the doctors who performed the operation, and then tries to find Archer. It's the typical body-switch, and I would be remiss to mention that Troy is responsible for the death of Archer's son many years ago, and thus Archer has a vendetta against him that explains his obsessiveness.<br />It's a potentially laughable premise, but the actors and director make you buy it. Travolta and Cage are both convincing and have a lot of fun playing each others' characters, and the supporting cast is just as believable. The script, by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, may have its bum dialogue lines here and there, but it's filled with ingenuity, plot-wise, as Troy tries to fit in with Archer's family and Archer tries to function in a prison. And of course the script gives director Woo plenty of leeway to go all-out with action scenes, and Woo does not disappoint, giving us plenty of stylish gunplay and loud explosions for about three action films, and even an audacious soundbite of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; as characters blow each other away. Woo sure lets his inventiveness run free here.<br />So okay, the film may be a little overlong, and that final gun battle at a church is perhaps too reminiscent of a similar battle in THE KILLER, right down to the flying pigeons motif. But all its flaws are forgivable in this case, since the movie is so thrilling matters of logic fall by the wayside. FACE/OFF may not be Woo's best film ever (I haven't seen HARD-BOILED yet), but it's pretty close to it, and in comparison to other modern action films, it stands pretty high there too. It'll ceratinly forever be one of my favorites. Recommended.
B00008ADPF|5.0|Ok, some crazy person wrote that &quot;to like Nickelback you must be retarded&quot; ok I'm all for opinons so I'll give mine: To NOT like at least one song one this CD you must be retarded. The first few CDs were OK, but this CD is great. Songs like &quot;Someday,&quot; &quot;Figured You Out,&quot; and &quot;Should've Listened&quot; are personal favorites. This is one CD i can listen all the way through without skipping a song. Nickelback is awesome!
6304711891|4.0|Okay, perhaps I am being very hasty with making that proclamation, since I'll admit I haven't seen any other Michael Bay film other than this one and ARMAGEDDON. Still, I cannot imagine that this much-maligned director has made a better action movie than this one. ARMAGEDDON was an ugly, bloated, flagrantly manipulative piece of action drivel. THE ROCK, on the other hand, may be just as manipulative, but I'll pick this very good pure action flick over ARMAGEDDON any day.<br />What's good about this particular action movie? Unlike ARMAGEDDON, THE ROCK doesn't attempt to be something more than good action entertainment. There are no synethetic emotions and all that nauseatingly insistent patriotism that seriously marred ARAMGEDDON, despite the fact that the antagonist of this movie is a former general who is looking for restitution for families of soldiers who died in combat under his command. THE ROCK is purely what it is, an action flick. As it turns out, it is a very skillful one at that, with convincing performances from all three leads (Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage, and Ed Harris) and exciting action scenes all around.<br />As for the plot, no, it is not particularly fresh (with elements borrowed from DIE HARD and even PULP FICTION), but the script adds some interesting elements to the equation, particularly with Ed Harris' General Hummel, who all throughout shows significant sympathetic human dimensions that make him stand out from the usual one-dimensional snarling villain. I liked those touches, as well as the twist at the end, in which the villains of the story seem to shift. It is with that twist that THE ROCK truly does stand apart from the action-movie crowd.<br />I always love a good action movie, and THE ROCK is definitely one of the good (if not absolutely great) ones. Recommended.
B00006879E|5.0|maroon 5 is so smooth and a very good sound. i mean on the verge of a classic. this sound does not come around to often. secret and she will be loved are hits. i feel everybody should have this cd. maroon 5 is here to stay.
0783225881|5.0|I've probably watched &quot;Field of Dreams&quot; about 25 times.  This is due, in part, to my love for baseball.  I appreciate its historic recollection of players and events and I've always found the film to be well done and very moving.<br />Even though I liked it already, this movie has taken on a greater significance to me since my father passed away in 1999.  In the end, when Ray Kinsella asks &quot;Hey Dad... You wanna have a catch?&quot;, how could anyone that loves their dad keep it together?  Costner's performance just seems to reach into your soul and bring out your emotions.  <br />When I saw the anniversary edition was available, I scooped it right up.  Most of the bonus inclusions are pretty thin but the documentary on how the book was transformed into the screen play and then the film is worth every penny.
B00006RIO7|5.0|This CD is one of my favourite CD's. The performances are much more gripping on film, I recommend buying the film and then if you like the performances buy the recording. Otherwise check into the stage performances of Chicago. <br />But wow! The Kander and Ebb score is to die for!! Chicago is one of my favourite musical scores and the energy and excitement of their music comes out so well here! Both of the leading ladies are amazing and even Richard Gere has his moments. An altogether amazing and must have recording!
0156027321|3.0|Life of Pi is a unique and ambitious book and deserves praise for that alone.  Clearly, as evidenced by the positive reviews in this forum, the fundamentals of the book are thought provoking and inspiring.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book but the second half was disappointing.  Perhaps my hopes were too high.  For such an imaginative story, Martel leaves little to the readers' imagination.  The level of detail about Pi's survival at sea was not necessary and simply boring.  The ending dumbs down the message of the book and robs the reader of a chance to put his/her own meaning to the characters and events of the story.  The greatness of this story is that it challenges the reader to think, to question, and to believe.  I wish the author would have given the reader a little more room rather than drown with detail and spoon-feed the already obvious theme.
0743455967|5.0|I enjoyed the book, especially the sections after CV. King rambles in CV. Although I found his life story fascinating, I was reading this book to learn his tricks of the trade! Shorten CV by 10% and the book will be 10. <br />I am glad that I read the book. I respect King for his openess about his methods of writing and about his ups and downs in his life. He doesn't try to paint himself as a saint or diety among writers. He's just a man who is passionate about writing (and reading). In the back there's quite a bibliography of suggested reading (all fiction, I think).
B000002HH2|5.0|I'd like to make a comment. While I don't own this CD, I find that there are some people here who write some immature reviews. And there are immature people on both sides (The pro and con).<br />I am an obsessed Britney Spears fan - I love her. But you know what? Bjork is amazing, and I love her as well. I'm going to buy this CD soon enough. Bjork is a genius that understands things that many people haven't seemed to fully grasp yet... but please people, grow up - you can love pop and Bjork at the same time, it's very much possible, so grow up and realize that it's possible. Liking a certain kind of artist or genre doesn't determine who you are as a person. Usually it's linked in some way, but it's not what determines you.
B0001NBMBC|4.0|Im not going to get angry at people who put down this slipknot cd because im not writing a review to try and argue that this cd is better...blah blah blah. The point is everyone is saying &quot;its not the same slipknot&quot; <br />I guess its just me who thinks that...isint there too much of the same? Why do you want a band to create more and more of the same. Theres 2 ways you can look at it, either they are getting bad because they have changed the tone/core doesnt drop &quot;F-bombs&quot; (as someone stated in a previous review) in their songs and that makes this album so bad or you could look at it as maturing and growing as a musical band. I think people need to be open minded when coming into the slipknot cd, ive talked to people who tell me their opinions about slipknot...ive heared alot of...&quot;their music is good but it just prolongs alot of the same sound after a while&quot;<BR>I think this cd covers that. If your looking for alot of the same old slipknot then maybe this album isint for you. If you just want to see the work and progression they have made then you should give it a try. People need to stop being so critical of every name that comes into mainstream. Its actually sad now that the subliminal meaning is its not &quot;cool&quot; to listen to mainstream music. Now that slipknot has become widely advertised people use this as an excuse to tear them down. No band stays the same. Its just a question about how your going to look at them when they make a musical change. Are you the type of person that says wah wah wah &quot;they sold out&quot; or appreciate what their offering. And if you dont like it...then dont listen to it. All greats change eventually and all greats head for a downfall. When i say greats i include black sabbath, pink floyd, even marilyn manson (even though not in the same category). Not saying slipknot can compare to the greatness of floyd and sabbath but a band changes and it either goes north or south. People dont like this album becuase they came into the cd expecting to hear the same thing they have heared on the last 3 albums.
0345446798|3.0|i must first admit that i have learnt 2 or 3 useful tips after reading this book. i was hoping that it'd be much more fruitful though.<br />this book is written like the author is sitting down chatting with you throughout a relaxing day about her experience; dropping hints and tips on the best way to handle dogs, the differences between primates (human) and canids(dogs), dog's emotions, how they have personalities, dominance etc.<br />invariably, such 'talks' will involve stories with relevant points, as well as some that stray quite far from the theme. bbeing interesting, i think many readers will not mind the occasional light hearted irrelevant story. <br />despite the fact that there are some useful hints and tips on how to handle our best friends, they are too few and far in between. bulk of this book is somewhat repetitive, and the author tends to be too 'talkative'. also, there is just too much comparisons with other primates like baboons, gorillas etc are often used to draw similarities and differences with dog's behaviours.<br />i hope i do not come across sounding like a sexist but i find that this book will more likely appeal to female readers, who are more emotive. i always like the more text book style, indexed do this, do that; this is bad, that is good etc.<br />this is a good and interesting book to read, but getting only 2-3 useful tips out of 220 pages i feel isnt good enough. a good idea will probably be for you to imagine buying a book by agassi on tennis. you'll end up hearing a many heartwarming stories about his life/marriages; and the other half of the book tells you about tennis, how the ball spins, some techniques on service, returns but generally you'll only learn 2-3 tips about playing tennis well like how your legs should be positioned, what type of racket may suit your style etc.
B000089CJI|3.0|at times this cd has promise and the songs sound they are building but they generally don't go anywhere. the vocals are irritating and overall the sound gets dull fast.<BR>there is one song that i do really like, #2 such great heights, but i think its because its reminiscient of several eighties songs; and i get a kick out of the lyrics to #5 recycled air, but that's because it's about the ice storm and i like that movie (it is about the ice storm right?)
0425152251|3.0|Sophie's World has an interesting concept, but this philosophical read is not for everyone. I have some criticism of the book, but also some praise. I'll start with the criticism. This is really a philosophy text disguised as a novel. The characters are caricature at best. They're really just devices Gaarder uses to get his point across. The dialogue is not believable either. Another potential problem for certain readers is that the philosophy lessons contained in this book are, in the novel, aimed for a young audience, for the novel centers on a fifteen-year-old character. If you have studied philosophy at some point in your life, this will probably be far too simplistic for you.<br />However, there are various things I liked about this novel. Sophie's World is a great introduction to philosophy. Those who find philosophy intimidating will very likely enjoy this book. I think it's a wonderful introduction to philosophy because it is aimed at the fifteen-year-old character. Even if you have studied philosophy, this book will be thought provoking, if only because it makes you think about what you once studied. I think this would be a wonderful book for parents to read with their teenage children. It would certainly make for some excellent discussions. The true strength of this book is the material it covers. Philosophy is a fascinating subject and Sophie's World is the perfect choice for anyone who would like to gently ease themselves into that subject.
0385510438|5.0|The Last Juror, John Grisham's latest novel, is filled with surprises and twists that will keep you reading for hours. Willie Traynor, a young kid just out of college, buys a small weekly paper in sleepy Ford County during the 1970s .The rape and murder of a young mother by Danny Padgitt, one of a known criminal family of Padgitts, headlined the paper and sold many copies. Willie's paper reported all of the gruesome details and infuriated the Padgitt family throughout the trial. During the trial Padgitt threatens the jury to avoid a conviction. Danny is convicted for two &quot;life&quot; sentences for his crimes but the courts paroled him in less than ten years. With Padgitt out the jurors, judge, and even Willie could be in danger. Grisham's writing turns a mediocre story idea into a great thriller. This book is a great read, Grishham fan or not.
0156027321|2.0|In Life of Pi, Yann Martel has created a story that explores the question of human belief and faith in God's existence.  I certainly hope Martel intended this to be a satire of conventional religious wishy-washiness (the stripping of complex religious phenomena to bland caricatures that would actually allow someone to be Hindu, Muslim and Christian simultaneously), because the narrator's dimestore philosophy and callow religious syncretism cannot possibly form the foundation of a coherent worldview.  In the end, the reader is treated to two brief versions of Pi's journey across the ocean: the 'good' version (which forms the bulk of the book), and the 'bad' version (which is rather unpleasant to read, and made more chilling by the pared-down style in which Pi relates it, but is probably the true version).  Fundamentally, Pi's choice to believe in the good story rather than the true one illustrates the human tendency to believe what one would wish to be true rather than what the evidence suggests to be the case.  <br />The book begins slowly, but the first hundred or so pages are necessary to provide the first half of the framework that surrounds the central narrative.  I have no way to judge the accuracy of the zoological and oceanographic information that the narrator relates in his retelling of his story, but like all satisfying survival stories, it is rich in detail.  Pi's journey ends rather abruptly, as does the book, but the last few pages are a treat for anyone willing to suspend the idea that Pi ended a resolute believer in God rather than a traumatized, half-mad, broken boy who turned to God in desperation.  <br />Still, 200+ pages of mostly indifferent writing is hardly worth the effort for the philosophical and literary dividends this book returns.  Although Life of Pi is probably not destined to be great literature, it is worth a read if you don't have anything more pressing to read, and it would be a great book to take on vacation (not so predictable andformulaic that you could read it in a couple of hours, but definately not so complex that you'd need a dictionary and Cliff's Notes to figure out what's going on).  2.5/5
B000003C2U|5.0|Human was the first album that introduced me to arguably one of the greatest death metal bands of all time, led by the late great Chuck Schuldiner who passed away from brain cancer in late 2001. Speaking of Chuck, the guy wrote great lyrics, all about the struggles of human emotions, and his vocals on here are just amazing too. Now about the album, it packed with fast, complexed guitar riffs, ear piercing solos from Chuck(who also played lead guitar)and Paul Masvidal. Steve DiGiorgio's(who also played with Sadus and Testament) bass work is excellent, and Sean Reinert's double kick drum action will just kick you in the gut. Suicide Machine, Flattening Of Emotions, Cosmic Sea, and Vacant Planets are my favorite songs on here, hey the whole album is just perfect, and I'm hoping to get some more albums from these guys. Anyways, if you love true brutal death metal, you will love this masterpiece, get it now.
B00012L786|5.0|For those who appreciate the fine acting of Thelma Ritter, this film is a must-have (along with Alfred Hitchcock's &quot;Rear Window&quot;). Her portrayal as the informant is a classic role for one of the best supporting actresses Hollywood has ever seen.<br />Richard Widmark also lends one of the greatest performances of his career, right up there with his roles in &quot;Kiss of Death&quot; (1947) and &quot;Judgement at Nuremburg&quot; (1961). The Criterion release provides a magnificent restoration of this underrated film noir gem.<br />I am rather baffled as to the clueless wonder at Amazon.com who tagged this motion picture with an NC-17 rating. Either that person didn't see the film, or the lights are on but nobody's home. &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; isn't a skin flick. It is one of the greatest dramatic thrillers of the 1950's.<br />Get this DVD on Criterion. It's an essential classic for any serious film collector.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I'm a man in my mid 70's. Films have been my hobby since the silent days so I've seen more than most people. When 4 Weddings and a Funeral was all over cable for so long, I ran into it a few times but did not like the title or the scene that was on at the time. But somehow, over time, I got involved and now have a copy in every format. I have watched it over 40 times. I thought this film might be similar but it was absolutely nothing like I expected. All I can say is, no matter what your age, go out and buy a copy. I can't imagine another Christmas going by without watching all the wonderful feel-good endings. Its not often the we get much real original material anymore. Everything seems to be a copy of some movie or movie material from the past. This one is a winner.

078681859X|2.0|I think this book would make a great movie.  While Harry Potter directors are agonizing over the amount of great material left on the cutting room floor, I think that there is only about 2 hours of decent material in this entire book, so it would make a director's job a piece of cake.  I kept waiting for it to get exciting, riveting, even \\"not boring.\\"  It never did.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The best part of this documentary is that there is no narrator. All parts of the story are described using pictures/sound clips/videos/commentary from the Beatles themselves, which makes for a very inciteful watch. <br />Plus, because each Beatle has a different personality, you get a mostly objective view. Paul is always trying to smooth arguments and rivalry over, George is cynical about the 60's in general, Ringo is friendly, and John (taken from past interviews) is always inciteful. <br />It was very interesting and it kept my attention throughout the entire 8 hour film. One thing I wish they had done was focus more time for the later years as a band (IMO when they made their best music), but it is hurried a bit. Of course, that is only relative since they spend 2 1/2+ hours on it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was transported by this DVD and am going to be giving it to all the children in my life! It is something that adults and children can enjoy together -- a combination of Alice in Wonderland and The Secret Garden, I highly recommend it.
B00000DSEN|4.0|1990 was an awkward year for Metal. It was a new decade and some of the great Metal bands were starting to look tired and boring. I waited with anticipation for the release of this album, I knew that no matter how the music ambient was changing, Maiden would not let me down. At first, the album didint sink into me. I gave it a few spins, but after a quick listen, I would quickly slip in &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; or &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;. But some years back, I put it on and gave the album a chance. It was mind blowing to hear the power in this Maiden album. The songs are perfectly constructed, the production is crisp and the band just sounds very energetic. The title track is a true gem. &quot;No prayer for the dying&quot; is a song that hardly ever gets talked about, but it is beautifull &quot;ballad&quot;. Other standout tracks in the true Maiden fashion are &quot;Tailgunner&quot;, &quot;Bring your daughter to the slaughter&quot;, and &quot;Hooks in you&quot;. I have talked to many Maiden fans and they dont seem to enjoy or like this album, but considering the albums that came after this one, I think this album is to often over looked.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne's new cd Under My Skin is by far one of the best cd's that I own. When I first heard it, I thought, WOW. Its totally cool. It rocks. I love it. Its way better than my other cds. I take it wherever I go. The songs are incredible, the music is awesome.
0380977788|5.0|Children have a far more vivid imagination. For children this story is scary, but they ask for more. This adult got creeped out by this tale about a girl and the world on the other side of the door. <br />Neil Gaiman has a strange kind of mind, and it conjures up imagery I had nightmares about when I read it :) <br />A very good read, one of Gaiman's best, and highly recommended for both children and adults.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Please make sure that you have done some research before dragging an artist of Stevie Wonder's caliber through the preverbial mud.  You do know that &quot;Songs in the key of life&quot; was originally written in 1976, and what you probably heard was the remastering of the orignial (which I also have)...So it was around years before Justin had even spoken his first words.  I won't take anything away from Justin as an artist, but he is completely outclassed when matched against Stevie Wonder.  His attempt to re-create some of Mr. Wonder's works is a wonderful gesture and a sign of respect; but it will never, ever compare to the original.  I suggest that you listen to more music that was released before 1995 to get a better understanding of why you like the music that is around today and how legends like Stevie and many others have influenced it.  Get to work young person!!!
0765310015|5.0|Martin fans will enjoy this series.  It has all the empire building, scope and intrigue of Martins novels.  Characters in the dozens, each with there own story and place, no matter how minor are here.  A world on the brink of collapse and darkness.  It has Tolkiens wonder, and diversity, with new races and the beginnings of an epic quest.  <br />It has everything I really like in a fantasy series.<br />The one thing I really like about all this is that there is a real sense of magic in the air.  I like my fantasy fast paced with the wizards casting spells, and the sword play good and bloody.  The one thing Martin seems to have missed is the magic in his books.  Too subtle for my taste.
B0001XALTG|5.0|When Trainspotting was released in 1996, it took the world by storm and caused a sensation not only in its homeland of England, but in the United States as well. Audiences couldn't get enough of this gritty, funny tale of Scottish heroin addicts. The Criterion Collection originally released an extras-packed laserdisc. Miramax subsequently released a bare bones edition on DVD and have now, finally, gone back to the well with a new \\"Definitive Version.\\"<br />The first disc features an audio commentary that first appeared on the Criterion laserdisc with actor Ewan McGregor, director Danny Boyle, screenwriter John Hodge and producer Andrew Macdonald. This is a very informative track with excellent insights by everyone as one would expect from Criterion.<br />There are also nine deleted scenes with optional commentary from the Criterion laserdisc. Most of it is extra footage that unnecessarily explained things and provided more information than needed.<br />The second disc contains the bulk of the extra material. \\"Retrospective\\" examines various aspects of the film with interviews done at the time of production and brand new ones conducted last year with Boyle, Hodge and Macdonald.<br />\\"Behind the Needle\\" shows a scene where Renton shoots up from three different angles with video commentary from Danny Boyle.<br />There is also vintage footage from the movie's screening at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. A camera crew interviews Martin Landau, Oasis' Noel Gallagher, Blur's Damon Albarn and Ewan McGregor as they exit the screening and offer their impressions of what they saw. Nothing too substantial here but it is a nice snapshot of the times.<br />There is also a teaser and theatrical trailers.<br />\\"The Making of Trainspotting\\" featurette was done at the time of the production. It is pretty standard electronic press kit material but still well made.<br />There are biographies of the cast and crew.<br />And finally, a gallery of production Polaroids mainly of extras from the movie with some cast included as well.<br />Trainspotting has aged surprisingly well considering it was one of those zeitgeist-defining movies. It also set the tone and style of later British exports like Snatch. Miramax has assembled an excellent DVD with a crystal clear transfer and a decent collection of extras that fans of this film will enjoy for hours.the movie with some cast included as well.<br />Trainspotting has aged surprisingly well considering it was one of those zeitgeist-defining movies.

B0000DBJ2B|5.0|I admit to being scared out of my wits by the Skeksis and the Garthim when I was little (reptiles combined with vultures and spiders combined with crabs are still terrifying to me), but I've come to really cherish this Tolkien-esque/ Froudian film. The gentle, nurturing Mystics, and cute little dog/ dust ball Fizzgig are among my favorite characters. The Podlings are simply adorable... the Gelflings are finely- featured and beautiful(Jen is very ponderous, if somewhat passive... Kira shows just how women can be, and are, just as strong as men!)... the Landstriders (which gracefully manage to combine the aspects of cats, moths, giraffes, camels, bats, rabbits, and who knows what else, into such beautiful creatures) are swift, courageous animals, and are very dear to me (for some odd reason). Possibly because I love animals(and I just have a thing for the underdog/unsung hero.) And there's the gentle Nebrie and many other creatures.<br />It's incredible to me that they were able to do this whole film without human actors! I seriously thought when I first saw it that they were real, flesh-and-blood creatures! Jim, Frank, Brian, and the rest of the crew really put their time and effort into making this film! Their hard work really paid off; the facial expressions and movements are impeccable! And the scenery is unbelievably lush, beautiful, and realistic. All of it looks so natural and earthy. It is as if they actually had real-live creatures acting, in my eyes... and they fact that they took the time to make up all of the history beind this story! That's just amazing!... and I could not get enough of &quot;The Making of The Dark Crystal&quot;. How they all managed to sculpt, design, and perform these characters is mind-blowing for me, since I'm far from an artist like this crew. No matter...<br />This film, while impressive, is not for all people; there is a sizable mortality rate in this film that (the little ones) are likely to find very disturbing, including severalstruggles (Screaming Podlings being snatched up to be converted into slaves, Nebries being served to the Skeksis for dinner, and two Landstriders squealing as they fall to their deaths in a cliffside battle with the Garthim... I can't bear to watch (or hear) animals being harmed, and especially animals as gentle and benevolent as they are. Was showing these things really necessary?)<br />Apart from little things here and there, it is truely quite an accomplishment, if not earth-shattering, to watch!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|I didn't expect to like this movie. &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; got on my nerves. So did &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. I want to buy this movie. I keep thinking about it. It has so many different depictions of love that it makes you think there's hope for everybody. It's impossible not to see something of yourself in this movie. It is a &quot;feelgood&quot; flick, but who cares, sometimes everyone needs to feel good.
B0000508U6|4.0|I just wanted to give my thoughts on this album...I think the album is amazingly produced. I think Chris has an exceptionally unique high voice and it really adds to this band! I think the arrangment of songs on the album is well put together. The lyrics are unique...it's just a good uplifting album with love songs and stories...
0375432302|3.0|What can be said about a book that is about religion,history, and murder. I like a book that I can sit and read to relax and enjoy. Not one that makes me want to stop and think.<br />  If you like a good murder mystery this book has it. This is not a book that I would reread. It has to much to keep track of.
B0000584V3|1.0|There are a few things that I just can't let slip by when deciding if I like an album and one of those is the quality of the singing. Well the singing here is, well not singing. It's growling. It sounds like the wordless rants of some sort of demon.<br />Check out the vastly superior Damnation from 2003. On Damnation, they seemed to have learned how to sing and wrote songs that actually sound good for whole tracks!
0446677450|5.0|Jennifer Lauck has written an unforgettable and truly inspiring memoir, in her first book titled Blackbird.  Not only has Blackbird won many awards, it has been sold in over twenty countries and proved so successful that another two books sequel it.  Blackbird tells the story of Jennifer's heartbreaking childhood from the age of five to twelve.  <br />Blackbird is set in the 1970's, in America.  Jennifer is a courageous young girl who lives with her very ill mother, her father, her brother B.J. and her two cats Moshe and Diana.  When her father remarries, Jennifer is forced to live with her ruthless and evil stepmother.  This is only the beginning of Jennifer's unhappy childhood and there are so many unexpected twists, that it seems Jennifer will never have a peaceful and happy childhood.<br />Jennifer writes the memoir from her point of view as a child and this made me feel so much more involved in the story.  Not only was it possible to feel the range of emotions Jennifer must have gone through, but I could see just how innocent she was about the happenings around her and her inability to seek help.  I felt angry at the pitiless characters Jennifer had to deal with and I could not understand how they could be so cruel to such a young child.<br />Blackbird holds the message of hope, survival and inner strength and I was very moved by the story.  It is best suited to the young adult age group onwards, because of the issues it raises.  I could not put this book down and Jennifer Lauck's writing skills are an invaluable tool in the telling of this story.  This story is not to be missed.
078322737X|5.0|This movie is way before my time, but i still can't help but love it. I live in the small town that this film was made in, Modesto California, and was reminded about the film by the annual graffiti festivil this weekend. It is true to Life, and still holds true in the most basic senses with my generation, I graduated High School in 1998 and my friends and I were always cruising, racing and having a good time any chance we got, and the mucle cars are still alive, they may be a little different but still alive. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 because it still relates to teenagers even after all these years, I believe this movie can bring generations together.
0385508417|3.0|3 1/2 stars.  I read this slight Christmas story as an unabridged audiobook in the balmy month of June.  I must say that reading this in the summer did not make me all gushy and wistful for the hectic Christmas season (which, I'm guessing is the point of this silly little tale)!<br />Luther Krank is quite disgusted by the commercialism of Christmas and the thousands of dollars he wastes every year on the season. This year, since his daughter is out of the country, he decides to skip it altogether and spend the holiday with his wife on a Caribbean cruise. He's looking forward to the trip and counting up all of the money he's sure to save.  His wife, Nora, reluctantly agrees to Luther's plan and the two embark on a diet to shed a few pounds before their trip. Unfortunately, Luther's nosy neighbors and co-workers can't seem to understand the whole &quot;skipping Christmas&quot; concept and nag him to reconsider.<br />Between the nagging neighbors, the solicitors hounding him for money and his ravenous hunger pangs, Luther is a man living on the edge. When the fire department arrives at the door peddling fruitcakes Luther is so ravenous he actually considers grabbing one of the noxious things for himself.  Little episodes like these fill the book with a sense of fun despite the often irritating plot twists (and even more irritating friends and neighbors). Poor Luther just can't get a break and I plugged away hoping he'd eventually escape the madness and get to enjoy his well deserved vacation.<br />This is a cute story about the ridiculousness of the Christmas season and the foolishness of rushing around like mad-people.  Though the ending isn't quite what I was hoping for it was written with a lot of heart.  I'm a bit too grumpy to appreciate the gushing sentiment and the feelings of goodwill but I'm sure the ending will satisfy those looking for such things.
1401300901|5.0|This book was very charming and delightful to read.  Not only can you laugh, cry, or feel angry for the main character all at once, but you get so involved with her that her emotions often times become your own.  This book is one that the characters keep on living even after you've read the last page.  I really have no complaints with the book, except for the fact that it is set in Ireland, and some of the phrases and wording are kind of hard to grasp.  However, that takes NOTHING away from the main story line.  Another perk of this book is that is really makes you step back and think about life and your loved ones in a whole different way...not many books can have that kind of effect.  Hope to see many more books by this author!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just purchased this DVD set and watched the whole thing this weekend.  WOW!  Buy It!  This is a first rate series that will show you would a tragedy that it was cancelled before even being given a chance.  Fox put it on Friday, which is one of the worst TV days there is.  This should have been their flagship show.  <P>The acting, directing and special effects are all 1st Class.  The show has the quality of something that is on HBO like the Sapranos or 6 Feet Under.<P>At the time I wrote this review 946 people had reviewed it and it had the full &quot;5 Stars&quot; of the Amazon rating system.  This is for good reason.  They will soon be coming out with a feature &quot;big screen&quot; movie based on the series which proves that loyal fans are not the only ones that think this show was worth its while.  Pick it up today!

0156027321|2.0|Life of Pi was heralded as one of the great novels of our time, and extolled as a source of faith.  Did it make me believe in God?  It didn't make me believe in Yann Martel, that's certain.  This book was pretentious and rambling, with a writing style unpalatable or even unaccessible to most casual readers.  The ending fizzled rather than popped.  I believe that by the last section of the novel Martel just wanted it to be over.  I expected the story to be based, at least in some small way, on a true story.  I have found no evidence that that is the case.  This makes it an imaginative, fanciful tale only, and while it's interesting to consider the protagonist's situation, it doesn't resonate with me on any level.  I see no subtle commentary.  Even God, who gets billing on the jacket blurb, appears little,, if at all in word or deed.  The main character himself rarely attributes anything that happens to the actions of God.  If I hadn't been informed that God was a theme in the book, I never would have thought so.  It therefore offers me no wonder or belief in anything, other than the author's ability to write an interersting, but ultimately pointless, story of survival.  This is a poor man's Robinson Caruso.  Heavy-handed language that sounds intelligent isn't really sufficient.  Far too much detail and not nearly enough meaning.  In a word, overrated.  In two, extremely overrated.  It was entertaining and not without its merits, but I don't understand the high praise.
B000060P79|1.0|I hate this cd, I loathe this cd.  I hate this band its like listening to NSYNC or Backstreet Boys with guitars.  BLEEEEHHH!!!  Bad music!!  Why are they on Warped Tour?!?!?  They don't belong there!! They should be on some pop tour or something.  Music like this shouldn't be made, it's just adding to the pollution problems we have.  BLAH!! enjoi.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Don't ask me why, but there are some movies that work better on the small screen than the large one. To my wonderful surprise, watching Mystic River last night, I discovered that Clint Eastwood's gorgeous, mournful drama/mystery is one of them. There's something about the downsized visuals of the movie combined with the intimacy of home viewing that just makes the movie click even more. And if you have seen it in theaters, I urge you to give it another viewing, for the ensemble acting of the movie is - no question - the finest of the year. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Laura Linney, Marcia Gay Harden, and Kevin Bacon all form unforgettable characters that truly feel real - just pay close attention to gestures; Linney lighting a cigarette and beckoning the cops inside, the icy torrent of fear that runs through Gay-Harden's body language, and the rigid but broken body and soul of Penn (who now, more than ever, shows that he deserved the Oscar over Bill Murray).<br />          And River actually moves faster than I remembered, mostly thanks to the film's first hour which still is difficult to watch in its unflinching look at tragedy and grief. The whole scene where Penn discovers his daughter's body is a masterpiece of timing and camerawork: when it finally hits him, the omnipotent lens pulls back into the heavens, letting Penn's grief echo as Eastwood's score swells. My favorite shot of the film is a pull-away from the scene of the crime into the Boston sky that floods the screen with white light. In fact, throughout the entire film (especially in its explosive final act) there is so much craft in the direction and acting that it's easy to overlook the film's flaws. Helgeland's screenplay becomes showy occasionally, while Laurence Fishbourne's cop is just annoying and could have been written (and, sorry Larry, acted) better. But even Psycho has a few things I'd rather overlook, and that's why Mystic River, a standard by which other movies will be judged in the future, deserves nothing less than a GRADE: A
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album brings out the vocal talent that Christina has got!!! She can sing notes that some of us can only dream about. This album is deep and from her heart. I love the way she writes her songs because she can!!! Her lyrics are awesome as they do not have really obvious rhyming words. Christina's album is a huge hit and i think you should buy this. You may not like it, but this is very good music.
B000008J3I|2.0|I was dissapointed when I heard this album. I heard that his album Tubular Bells was a popular album and I remember hearing &quot;Sentinel&quot; on the radio. So, I bought the cassette just to give it a try. After hearing the album, I was dissapointed that Sentinel was different than the other songs on the album. There were a few good instrumentals but I still didn't like most of the album. Mike Oldfield uses a unique mixture of sounds in his music and he includes a few voices as well. Some of his songs I would not even classify as new age, like &quot;Shadow On The Wall&quot; since it sounds like rock music and doesn't have good vocals. Even if you are a Mike Oldfield fan, I would still recomment listening to the album before you buy it.
0689835604|5.0|This book is great for infants / young toddlers who are just getting interested in being read to.  Our one-year-old enjoys lifting the flaps and discovering not only where the baby's belly button is in the book, but also pointing out her own.  Our older child enjoyed this book at this age also, and is enjoying reading it to her younger sibling now.  Nice, simple, and fun.  I would highly recommend this book.
B000148KK2|1.0|A disappointing album filled with that wonderful voice singing the most depressing music. I was going to buy concert tickets for her next Northeast show, but I fear that it will promote this album, so I'll pass.<br />Has success or the Costello collaboration spoiled Diana?
0312995423|2.0|If you haven't read any of Dan Brown's books, I would begin with Angels and Demons or Da Vinci Code before this one.<br />Dan Brown spins a great tale, but Digital Fortress lacks the carefull detail and conundrum of his better works.<br />If you are a Dan Brown fan, you'll like this book because it follows his classic model:<br />good looking genius hero learns of problem when someone dies, murder mystersy feel leads you to assume inaccuracies of characters, characters developed as antagonists evolve to unsung heros, the bad guy ends up being an authority figure that is trusted by the hero..<br />I enjoyed this book because I didnt' have a book for my 2 hr commute from work; it fit the bill, but didn't change my life.
078322611X|5.0|I watched the movie on TV again on Saturday Night with the vinettes showing what was going to be on the DVD.  Very intriguing the parts where the former players talk about their lives and their play.<br />It is all about connecting with your dad.  What Kinsella did and what this movie did was attempt to make closure for Kinsella with his dad and, in his mind, for the players who had dreams that were not fully or in ever realized.<br />Interesting sport baseball.  It is an American and now international sport that surpasses boundaries.  It is a game like no other.  Any young man can remember the feeling of having a catch with dad or learning how to hit a baseball or other ball with a bat for the first time.  It really made us connect with dad and me like others, always wanted dad to have a catch with us.  He taught us not to be afraid of the ball when catching.  To keep our eyes open when having a catch and keeping our eyes on the ball when swinging at the ball.<br />Kinsella captures something else in his story about the field of his dream to connect with his father again and to ease his pain.  It is the pain of a life unfulfilled seen through the lives of players, the 8 players from the White Sox who were kicked out of baseball for good at the peak of their careers due to a gambling scandal.<br />The movie makes you wonder about dreams and desires achieved versus those which are not achieved.  My thoughts go to my deceased uncle Jack who tried out for the NY Giants in 1939 or 1940 as a catcher.  He had a life changing injury, as the story goes, that caused him not to be picked that year.  I see my uncle in that field of dreams, wondering if he would or could have made it if he had not gotten hurt and, if he had, what a life he would have had for his family.<br />I really love the connection that Cosner, as Kinsella, has with his dad.  \\"Dad, can we have a catch....?\\"  Wow, too powerful for words.  This movie is one where the author honors and respects his dad and finally connects and fully washes away any guilt he may have had for not connecting with his father before his death.<br />There is a scripture that states, \\"honor your father and your mother that your life may be long in the land....\\"  To Ray Kinsella, \\"Long Life.\\"  Thank you for a beautiful tribute.finally connects and fully washes away any guilt he may have had for not connecting with his father before his death.<br />There is a scripture that states, \\"honor your father and your mother that your life may be long in the land....\\"  To Ray Kinsella, \\"Long Life.\\"  Thank you for a beautiful tribute.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|I think that just because a band or a artist evolves, it doesnt mean that they have changed or sold out in any way.  I definately think this is the best album that they have made yet.  I dont have the Stone Sour album, so I cant compare it to that, but this cd sounds more like a classic rock cd at certain points because of the acoustic tracks and the &quot;melody&quot; that is incorporated (think Staind).  I would have to say however that the album is not as hard as the last two in my opinion, but the expression of other emotions on this album is probably the reason why.  You cant continue to talk about the same subject matter forever;  Korn should definatly take note.
B00005JL78|5.0|I am so glad my husband dragged me to see this movie.  From the advertising, it did not look too interesting, although I love action and sci-fi.  Minority Report is magnificent.  One of the most original, thought-provoking, and entertaining movies to come along in twenty years.  This is a true classic.<br />Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell are wonderful in their roles as Precrime Police, stopping crimes and charging &quot;criminals&quot; even though the crime has not taken place.  The Precrime Police have three empaths who provide them with information.  The empaths are suspended in water solution, and although they are not slaves, have never seen the outside world.  One of the empaths is female.  She is one of the most compelling characters, although she does not say much or get much screen time.<br />The last scene had a few women in the theater crying.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|Yes, I think I am. If Kat Beckinsale is supposed to be a vampire, I missed it. Underworld is more like a try hard Matrix than anything else. I never want to hear this in the same sentence as Interview With a Vampire quite simply because Underworld has nothing to do with Vampires. It simply uses them to make a group oppose the warewolves. Kate or 'Selene' actually passes out from lack of blood (funny considering she's supposedly dead), when the light in the mansion goes out, the 'vampires' actually need to carry torches in order to see. And lastly, I've never met a vampire that can;t hear trains in a tunnel before. All in all, this is one of those movies that you watch if you're a fan of 'Dracula 2000'(yes, it;s THAT sad).
B00003CXXM|5.0|I am very glad my husband dragged me to see this movie.  Although I never would have thought Matt Damon could play an action hero, he does, and a very good one.  His character, Jason Bourne, really knows how to take someone down, fast.  The European sets and slightly dimmer lighting lend an authentic touch to the movie, making it seem more real.  You just want rest for the two protagonists, but they are being hunted mercilessly.  How they seek to evade capture while developing their relationship keeps you on the edge of your seat.  There is not much time to breathe between the action scenes, and they are great.  Fighting and car chases are all so suspenseful you can't breathe.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is one of the deepest science fiction books of its time, you'd never really guess that it was written about 50 years ago. It tells of a boy named Paul who is destined to become the religious leader of the Fremen, the native dwellers of Arrakis. The politics and religious aspect in Dune are very well balanced and the characters are quite realistic for a sci-fi. If you're into sci-fi or not, you really should read this book.
B00005AR3G|2.0|The Emperor's New Groove never gets your pulse up.  You never care about any of the characters.  It would have been ok as a Saturday morning cartoon special, but is unworthy of the title &quot;Disney Animated Feature.&quot;  David Spade stars as an Inca king who is turned into a llama to teach him a lesson on kindness.  John Goodman voices his best friend.  The villian looks like an anorexic Cruella DeVille with disgusting spidery eyelashes.<br />Endless babbling and anachronistic cultural references made me weary.  I was glad when it was over.  I know that the destruction of the Inca civilization at the hands of the Spanish conquistadors was one of history's greatest tragedies.  But if I were Pizzarro, and the Incas were this annoying, I would have annihilated them, too!  I recommend Disney's 2003 &quot;Brother Bear&quot; instead, as a wonderful film for both kids and adults.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This movie is stunnig. Aronofsky has thrown his glow to the sand with this disturbing and challenging film that will demand of you as viewer one moment of your valuable time because this film is important.<br />The infinite loneliness in which lives Ellen Burstyn (I still wonder why she didn't received the Academy Award for this performance)is just the starting point of horror nightmare which will involve four lives.<br />The hopeless and the no reason to live in the behavior mood of his son , will lead him with his bride and his friend to find the delights and pleasures of an artificial universe , due this world is awful and understandable for these three border characters.<br />The narrative is loaded of brilliant effects ; every one of the meaning characters is inmersed in his own mind jail. The slow decline in the moral will lead to feed the unthristy need of getting more and more ; the huge greed for feeling alright.<br />You'll experience a journey to hell , but beware ; I don't mean special effects ; it's the awfulness , the anguish  in its major expression.<br />This film , from its first release has become in a sudden cult movie.<br />If you felt the human desperation in the man with the golden arm in the fifties , so then prepare your senses when you watch this film.<br />Top notch performances and no mercy script!
1400032717|5.0|This novel deserves a wide readership.  Written from the perspective of an intellectually gifted but emotionally challenged young man, Christopher John Francis Boone, the language in the novel is straightforward; the plot readily clear. This book merits a receptive readership across a wide age group, from young adolescents to adult readers.  Although it can be approached from a range of angles, my interest was sustained by the truth-telling propensity of young Christopher.  Truth matters to Christopher, and language as a vehicle for conveying the truth matters, in its way, as much to him as his mathematics. Yet, as this novel shows, in the world of mature, work-a-day adults, what matters is not truth, but the emotional consequences of it.  Just as Christopher is insistent on truth-telling, he is surrounding by adults who have a greater interest in concealing the truth as a means to shelter young Christopher from its consequences. A fast, wonderful read, this book could, in my view, supplant any number of required classics that middle and high-school students are today required to digest.  Here's hoping its attains the status it deserves!

Survival is the famous Marley reggae sound to politically charged amthems that are great like Zimbabwe, Babylon System, and So much trouble in the world. This another that you need to get your hands on.
6305499365|5.0|I'm only 16 so I haven't experienced the life that this movie is based on, but I still think it's hilarious. My brother bought the movie a few years ago and I've watched it many times and never get tired of the humor. I think that pretty much everyone would find at least some parts of this movie laugh-out-loud funny. The characters are so great, especially Milton and Bill Lumbergh. This is one movie that I think everyone should consider buying, because once you've seen it for the first time you're bound to want to watch it on many more occasions...and force all your friends to watch it with you!
B00005KB9T|5.0|This is a good reggae album period and all of the songs have strong statements. The 2 songs that Peter Tosh does, 400 years and Stop that Train, are very good. The rest is solid with that classic reggae Bob does. Recommended for the reggae fan looking for something good to listen to.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The movie shows a small part of life that most people never get to see or understand.  The character development isn't all that involved but that isn't what the movie is about.  It's about two people in a situation that brings them together and makes that situation better.  The only thing they have in common is that they aren't like everyone else around them.
B00005MKA1|5.0|If you are reading this then I am telling you, GET THIS!! Kaya is a laid back album consisting of love, sunshine and of course, marijuana. This is one of the best of Bob's cd's. Recommended totally.
B000002UA0|5.0|this stunning debut album released in august 1967 from this great british rock band demonstrated barret's dominant role in the group before the advent of gilmour.songs were full of childlike images with impressive guitar work from syd barret compilmenting wright's unusual keyboard style and contained underrated masterpieces like arnold layne about a transvestite and see emily play a psychedelic classic.i recommend this highly to you.
B000088E6M|1.0|50 Cent is everything hip pop is rite now.

If u want a club album here it is but for gods sake if u love hip hop like i do dont buy this junk.
B000002U9W|5.0|the fifth album from this great rock band during the david gilmour era of the band was an underrated album with an experimental sound and though not that great in the mould of the dark side or the wall but still this album would surely be appreciated by floyd fans like me.worth a buy.
B000002LND|5.0|I've always known who Madonna was (flashy, controversial, famous for being famous), but I never understood why. I'm 18 and I was curious about this so-called &quot;Pop Icon&quot;, so I purchased this CD. I was astounded. After so many years of being a famous face, we tend to forget why a person becomes famous in the first place (Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, Michael Jackson), we forget their genius. After listening to this album, I finally realized why this woman is so loved and idolized, she is truly deserving of all her hype. Her songs are just pop perfection. They are everything pop music &quot;MUST&quot; be, and have become individual anthems. The title, first of all, is the perfect title for this album simply because you begin to realize, as you listen, that this woman is a gift to the art of music from heaven above. Songs like &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Cherish&quot;, &quot;Into The Groove&quot;, and &quot;Like A Prayer&quot; are pure treasures. All the songs are treasures that should always be remembered. For the first time in my entire life of being a music listener, I can't decide on a favorite song from an individual artist. They are &quot;all&quot; that good. If you love pop, and divas, or if you're a music listener in general (no matter what genre you listen to) this is one album to have in your collection. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B000006TRV|5.0|i would highly recommend you this classic containing two discs of the finest music ever made which was one of the largest selling rock albums ever worldwide.this phenomenally selling cd contained the chart topping single another brick in the wall and comfortably numb one of the greatest rock songs ever made.highly recommended.
B000063DHK|5.0|First of all... let me just say that double CDs in one package rule!!! LAD was Iron Maiden's longest tour ever!(almost a year)<BR>Now, I really don't have much to say about this album except that any Iron Maiden fan who doesn't own this album is worthless. Every Maiden fan should wake up everyday realizing that they got the greatest live album by Iron Maiden. The tracks on this album were unbelievable, the second CD is crammed with old classics from the Di'Anno era. That's great because I haven't heard much Di'Anno songs live. Take my advice, get this CD while you can or admit to the fact that your a worthless Maiden fan.<br />I realize that I'm being a little meaner than in my past reviews, sorry! I just got Live After Death and well, I don't know what we Maiden fans would do without this album.<br />Up The Irons!
B00006AG5N|5.0|what more has to be written about this great compilation from one of the finest rock,n,roll singers of all times containing 31 beatuful songs like hound dog and jailhouse rock extemely highly recommended.
0226264203|4.0|This is a new edition of Milton Friedman's classic 1962 capitalist manifesto. As such, it was ignored, spurned and hated for decades by the intellectual, post-Keynesian establishment. In the 60s, Friedman once found himself debating a liberal who attacked him by simply reciting Friedman's views of the proper role of government. This was working rather well with the audience of college students until he quoted Friedman's opposition to the military draft. Friedman suddenly found himself awash in the unexpected cheers of students. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of his career. Friedman won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1976, and his ideas gained some degree of mainstream acceptance in the Reagan years - although many of his thoughts remain controversial. To the extent that Friedman debunks myths about the Great Depression that are widely accepted as fact, perhaps he has a point about the semi-privatization of education. We strongly recommend this volume to those who seek a deeper understanding of government's role in a free-market economy.
B0000CABBW|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I was enchanted by the performance of Keisha Castle-Hughes and fully appreciated her struggle to be recognized as a leader of her Maori community.  Upon seeing it again a year later I realized how abusive Pai's relationship with her grandfather is.  When a twelve-year old girl feels she must sacrifice her life in order to realize her destiny and win the respect of her grandfather, this is not a vision quest but suicide.<br />So many young girls today sacrifce who they really are in the name of societal beauty and cultural acceptance.  Thousands of years ago, in the story of Abraham and Isaac, Abraham was stopped from sacrificing his own son to fulfill his destiny with Yahweh.  This was a crucial mark of difference between the early Hebrew faith and other tribal religions in Mesopotamia, that there would be no child sacrifice to appease gods or ancestors.  Children were now the vessel through which the promise of God would be fulfilled.  Later a man named Jesus of Nazareth would be crucified for his passion to live in the love of God the Creator so completely.  But he was a man, an adult who could make decisions for his own life.  A twelve year old girl is still a child; on the brink of womanhood but a child nonetheless.<br />To uphold this movie as a role model for other young girls (and boys) is wonderful up until the last few scenes.  I apologize for the spoiler content in this review but I feel strongly about the mixed message this movie gives.  Perhaps I am imposing my Western, 21st century point of view upon an indigenous culture, but how does this message translate to young teens facing adversity and lack of acceptance from peers and possibly family?<br />This movie is all about keeping tradition but also about making changes to move into the future. Yet Pai's sacrifice is something of the ancient world, not the one she hopes to lives in.  When watching this movie with your teenage children, talk with them about how they see Pai and could there have been an alternative ending, another solution to the impass between Pai and her grandfather.

Well a few days later Emma finds out that her no-named seatmate was in fact her boss Jack Harper. Now Emma is foced to work with a man that knows everything about her.<br />As in other books, Ms. Kinsella offer the reader great characters, with a good pace that hold the readers attention. A book by Sophie Kinsella should not be missed.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I have been a fan of Avril Lavigne since her debut.  Her first album, Let Go, was tremendous.  I loved every song on it.  But I have to say that her new album, Under My Skin, is by far her best album.  The songs on this album are a lot more grown up compared to the teenage type songs of her first album.  It seems that Avril has finally been able to write her own music and it far surpasses the music from her earlier album.  I would recommend this CD to any one who was any type of fan of Avril Lavigne or to any fan of music in general.
B00003CWRX|3.0|One of those films that I always meant to watch and only now, years after the fact, I get around to doing so, and I am a little disappointed. Docudrama about top tobacco corporate vice president who aligns with TV's &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to expose tobacco company standards is too narrow-minded in scope to encompass all the havoc the tobacco empire exposes on the world, relying on the sympathetic plight and near ruin of the family man executive whose behavior borders on paranoia and insecurity. Al Pacino as a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer and Russell Crowe as the reluctant crusader executive both seem overdrawn as characters, Pacino in his familiar nervous edgy urban guy persona and Crowe as the weakling confused executive both grow tiresome after a while. Still, the movie moves along briskly and a surreal sequence where a hotel wall becomes an imagined memory invokes the sometimes hopelessness of tobacco addiction. But why does the film feel the need to mercilessly pick on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;'s Mike Wallace? I seem to be missing the inside word here.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril's new album &quot;Under my skin&quot; is an awesome album.  I definately think she topped her last album and this one shows her moving up as a singer and songwriter..I think everyone should own this album.. Rock On Av!
B00005AQF7|5.0|I think the title pretty well explains it, but in case you didn't know.....<br />By the way, don't be hatin' on this cd just because you don't like rap.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|This is a semi-interesting movie about Wellesley College in the 1950s, and an art history teacher who comes along and changes the lives of her students in 1953. How accurate a portrait it is of Wellesley at any time, I don't know; apparently they showed the movie in an early screening to a bunch of 1953 Wellesley grads and they hated it. But Wellesley still holds the &quot;hoop roll&quot; that's shown in the movie -- the winner of the hoop roll used to be said to be the first one to marry, now apparently it means they'll achieve &quot;success, however they define it.&quot; Whatever. Seems stupid to me, but I didn't go to Wellesley or anyplace like it, so what do I know.<br />There are many very charming moments in this movie, and some fine performances from the young actresses, particularly Maggie Gyllenhall, who plays her character with a great mix of brazenness and vulnerability, and the actress who plays Connie, who's adorable - you can't help rooting for her in her quest for love and understanding.<br />The movie features two of my least favorite actresses - Kirsten Dunst, who is not pretty or talented enough to keep getting the plum roles she's getting, and Julia Roberts, whose talent is overrated, in my opinion. Apparently Roberts had a hand in producing the movie and the script definitely plays to her advantage, aggrandizing her in places and also giving her lots of chances to look serious, over-emote and flash her toothy grin. Dunst's character is the girl you love to hate, as the uptight, brittle preppy girl who has the fairy-tale wedding to a hunk who ends up not to be Prince Charming. I never felt sorry for her character at any point in the movie, even after the big &quot;reveal&quot; towards the end. Julia Stiles is also somewhat good as Dunst's character's best friend, but they don't give Stiles a lot to do, which is probably good, considering she doesn't seem to have much of an acting range. I really wish they had expanded Gyllenhall's part to give hermore to do; she was the most compelling part of the movie, for me.<br />While there are moments in the movie that are heartwarming, as a whole, the script is a mess. People do things with little or no motivation, characters are introduced and then largely dropped, storylines are introduced and then peter out with little or no explanation of what happened or why we were shown that piece of information in the first place. Things that should have a lot of emotional weight seem glossed over, while the movie perseverates on some minor details that don't seem to make that much difference to the overall story. The story jumps around a lot, with very little continuity. Maybe this was supposed to be more of a diary of Roberts' character's year at Wellesley; if so, it's still not done very well. This could have been a very good movie if they had chosen a screenwriter that could have woven the pieces together into a coherent whole. As it stands, the movie is practically a series of vignettes, rather than a whole story.<br />As for the pro-feminist message of the movie - it's pretty heavy-handed, but I didn't feel beaten over the head by it. The movie doesn't have a lot of positive things to say about marriage in the 1950s - I wasn't alive then, so maybe life was as wooden and stifling as the movie portrays, and men were for the most part clods who wanted &quot;dinner on the table by 5 o'clock,&quot; regardless of how much respect they had for their wives. I don't know. But I really, really doubt things were as black and white as the movie portrays.<br />All in all, this is worth a watch for the costumes - they're fabulous - and Maggie Gyllenhall's performance. Other than that, there's not much &quot;there&quot; there, if you know what I mean. A clean-up screenwriter could have done wonders with the movie, it's too bad they didn't bring one in. A lot of fine talent was more or less wasted on this movie - hopefully the good actresses from the film will get other chances to showoff their talent in a vehicle more worthy of them.
B000005JA8|5.0|I love this record. I get irritated by charges that people only 'pretend' to like it just to seem cool (of course people do this with all kinds of music). I don't know if Beefheart is technically a 'talented musician', but I do know that I have gotten hours of honest enjoyment out of this album (and never thought to rub it in anyone's face). I'd hate for anyone to miss out on some spectacular music just because of an attempt to 'lower the ratings' or charges of 'inaccessibility'. Truly inaccessible music would be something like Throbbing Gristle (yes, people both pretend and don't pretend to like that too). But there's no reason for fans to get upset either way: TMR has been around for a long time, and a bad 'rating' won't hurt it: the Amazon reviews page is not the powerhouse of cultural arbitration some seem to believe. The ultimate proof of TMR's invincible greatness is the large number of excellent musicians, past present and future, who cite it as an influence on their own music. This is well documented and worth more than all the internet reviews put together. It's unfortunate that pretentious Beefheart fans exist, but middlebrow 'elitism' is no better. Artists should not be attacked for attempting something outside the norm. Read Lester Bangs's excellent appreciations of Beefheart: even he admits the guy is a bit pretentious at times, but that's not necessarily incompatible with making great music.
B00006LPES|5.0|I entirely agree with the previous reviewers. The actors and actresses are of the best choice. The characters are so well portrayed and the settings are so well depicted. The overall effects are quite convincing. It's defintely shocking and at least commercially this film is a success.<br />The choice of Schubert's music at least serves two points. First, Schubert's music is one of the saddest in the history of music, it's the music of the loniest pilgrim. Second, contrary to Beethoven's music, which is so clear and straight forward, the change of moods in Schubert's music is so sudden and so abundant and that it is often difficult to follow, so are the turns and twists in this story.<br />A general survey of the life of the pianists would making this story more convincing. An American critized Kissin for knowing nothing but playing on the piano from day to night all his life; Glenn gould shut himself up in front of the piano since or before his pre-teens; Allica de Larrocha's mother begged her daughter to &quot;live her life&quot; (Allica's word), instead of sacrifying it to the piano; MargaretArgerich's &quot;fiance&quot; (Margaret's own word) was the piano... The life of a musician destined to become a concert pianist could be very lonely ( and boring )to the point of abnormality unless you really love it, or unless you can balance it with sufficient chamber music or the like. Yet, competition is so keen that 99 concert pianists out of a hundred would advise against a cereer of a concert pianist unless he is exceptionally talented. <br />Obviously the heroine here, despite her sacrifice, didn't make it as a concert pianist. Her mother, so possessive and dominating, openly urged her to earn more money in order to buy a flat. Furthermore, the family has a history of mental problem; and her mother sharing the bed with her even when she was forty something... Needless to say, this case is by no means a norm yet it is not at all unconvincing.<br />What is controversial though is the deliberate distortion of the sound of all music, be it's piano or vocal music, so that there is NO MUSIC LEFT AT ALL. Perhaps this serves the main theme of the story better, delivering a greater impact upon the audience. And yet on the other hand, one also wonders if that is really necessary, whether a mix of bitteress &amp; sweetness would be more impressing.
B00008YJH5|5.0|I believe this to be the best of the Pixies' albums, with Doolittle at a very close second. It may be true that they wrote better songs down the road, but with Steve Albini's grinding production and the fire down somewhere in Black Francis' lungs and Joey Santiago's right hand, this is the most bone-crunching, throat-tearing, purely PHYSICAL album the Pixies ever made (and certainly one of the most intense albums rock music ever produced). <br />Every thumping, screaming, thrashing moment conjures images of bodies - usually bodies coming apart (\\"Break my body\\", \\"Broken face\\", \\"Bone machine\\"). But even what passes for romantic/love songs on the album are obsessed with physical detail, such as when Black Francis insists his lover prove her long-distance existence with physical evidence (\\"bloody your hands on the cactus tree/wipe it on your dress/and send it to me\\"). \\"Gigantic\\", which sports one of the best bass/guitar riffs *ever*, is obsessed not even with lust or sex, but with Kim Deal's swaggering celebration of her boyfriend's, ahem, \\"big big love\\". This exceedingly frank approach compliments their intense sound perfectly. The singing by both Deal and Francis is at the peak of their abilities, blending together like no male/female pair has sung since the Mamas and the Papas (if Mama Cass was into heavy metal). And, probably my favorite part, Black Francis produces probably the best screams I've ever heard throughout the album, particularly on \\"Bone Machine\\".<br />I could go on and on about Joey Santiago's remarkably innovative guitar playing and the fantastic drumming, but I'll leave it at this: Surfer Rosa is a crucial album for anyone who is interested in rock music made past 1989 or so. Most rock movements of the 90's, and therefore everything beyond, were deeply influenced by this album (most famously Kurt Cobain admitted to having \\"stolen\\" much of his sound from the band - stolen is a bit harsh, but somewhat accurate). No collection is complete without it.
0375751513|5.0|Beautiful on the outside, ugly on the inside.  That's Dorian Gray and the symbolism couldn't be more relevant today.  This is one of the reasons why this has remained and will continue to be a classic.  I won't bore you with a summary of the plot.  I'll simply ask that you please give this book a read.  It's quick, it's short, it's exciting, it's thrilling, it's very well written and it's a good summer read - I promise.
1931788340|5.0|On page six of this large book, Stephen Shore writes, in the Artist's Note, \\"The book you are holding in your hands amounts to what might be called the photographic equivalent of a director's cut\\". It is in the nature of such things you now get an additional ninety-four photos with the forty-nine that were in the original 1982 Aperture edition, though this is not strictly true because some that were in the original are not in this edition.    I bought the original book because I loved the way Shore captured the everyday urban American outdoors and of course the amazing color and detail.  This new edition is even better because the photos are now larger, mostly 10.5 by 8.25 inches.  The other thing I love about some of these photos is the way Shore captures the street corner, this seems to be a favorite composition (stretching back to the famous FSA photos of the Thirties) with contemporary photographers and Photorealists painters like Richard Estes or Davis Cone.  Shore's 'El Paso Street, Texas, July 5, 1975' could just as easily be an Estes painting.  There are several corner photos in the book and they are just stunning.    Another reviewer has commented on the amount of detail in these photos, helped of course by the two hundred plus screen, the original book used a 175 dpi.  Apart from the screen it is interesting to compare images that appear in both books and the color does vary.  'Beverly Boulevard, June 21 1975' in the original (page 39) is predominately brown for the street area, in this edition (page 115) it has changed to a predominately blue cast.  I wonder if this is the sort of thing that concerns collectors of first edition photo books?    In addition to the photos in this beautifully designed and printed book there are two text pieces, the first one, by Stephen Schmidt-Wulffen, includes twelve photos from Shore's 'American Surfaces'.  The back of the book includes biographical notes and a useful bibliography.    This latest 'Uncommon Places' will bea book I'll look through for some years to come.
B00005N83M|5.0|Love Don't Cost A Thing - One of the best tracks of the album, love the beat and the lyric is good too! (5/5)<br />I'm Real - The videoclip is very good, too bad the dancebreak isn't included in the mp3. (4/5)<br />Play - First I didn't like this song, but now I do. However, it is't J.Lo's best song! (3,5/5)<br />Walking On Sunshine - Good summer song! Nothing to say about it (3,5/4)<br />Ain't It Funny - The BEST track of the whole album. The lyric, music, voice..everything is good! (5/5)<br />Cariño - Catchy song, love the beat! (4/5)<br />Come Over - I don't prefer this song. It's boring..(3/5)<br />We Gotta Talk - I love this song! But the album has better ones.

B00004U28G|2.0|I bought this movie on DVD because it was on sale and &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot; DVD was no where in sight (because it's not on DVD). I have never seen this movie until now but having watched I would happily take my $8.00 back if offered.<br />The best part of the movie is the opening session, one sleek black Lamborghini tearing up the road. The rest is ridiculous and corny.<br />More emphasis should have been placed on the cars rather than the actors, actresses, and corny stuff. &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot; did a better job with two lovely cars and serious acting mixed with just the right amount of comedy; not corny and ridiculous antics.<br />Scenes of beautiful actresses in this movie are nice but who needs it if there are beautiful cars and who wants to see an ambulance go cross country, that killed me. Buy &quot;The Gumball Rally&quot; instead if it ever comes out on DVD. If you still have a (soon to be antique) VHS player then your lucky and can buy it now. <br />If you really want this movie though buy my copy for four bucks so I can take back 50% of my loss. It's only been used once and I won't use it again.
B00005JKNC|5.0|Unheard of right?  Not anymore.  Jim shows the world that there is more to him than being dumb and/or dumber.  This movie should get 5 stars, so why is it rated so low?  Well Carrey made a name for himself as a comedian, and people were expecting laughs, little did they now, the only laughs they were going to get out of this movie were the wisecracks that come out every once in a while.  This movie is one of the best I've seen.  Peter (Carrey), a sucessful movie writer isn't as sucessful as he would like to be, trouble boils up and he decides to take a little joy ride with what he has left.  This simple joy ride turns into a big accedent and Pete ends up in a unfamiliar town, but the town doesn't find Petey to unfimiliar.  They mistake poor ol' Pete for Luke, who goes missing after a brave act during World War Two.  Everyone mistakes him for Luke, but the people Luke was closest to know there's something wrong.  The town needed Luke, and things shape up making Pete's unknown new life a happy story.  <br />I'd have to say the best part of the movie would be the ending.  It's perfect as they would say in &quot;Secret Window&quot;.  Pete, now knowing who he is, gives the US Court more then they wanted to hear, a lecture that makes more then enough sense to everyone.<br />This movie is top-notch, making a combination of intense drama with jazzy swing music, The Majestic, is more then just a movie theatre, more than a movie, it's legend.
B000007492|5.0|A CLASSIC COMPILATION FROM A GREAT POP ROCK BAND FEATURING GREAT SONGS LIKE THE LOGICAL SONG BREAKFAST IN AMERICA.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
1400032717|2.0|Dont get me wrong, i liked the book. I mean i didnt looove it, but it was weird enough to hold my attention for the duration. I liked the tiny diagrams and pictures aiding in obscure descriptions. I liked the off beat characters. And I especially liked, maybe loved (but dont push it), the first fifty pages. Nevertheless, I HATED THE ENDING. A book should end with some finality. Nothing less than genocide, nuclear winter or buddha like enlightenment. Perhaps the dog really died of boredom?
B000006TRV|5.0|THIS WAS WITHOUT ANY DOUBT ONE OF THE BEST PINK FLOYD ALBUMS FEATURING THE GREAT COMFORTABLY NUMB.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL ROCK MUSIC FANS.
B00005V331|2.0|I first heard Welcome To Hell back in 1981 and thought it stunk, my opinon hasn't changed.  I like the idea of Venom, brutal metal with dark themes.  This album along with Motorhead's much, much better Ace of Spades album gave metal a kick in the pants.  Welcome to Hell was extreme, obnoxious, heavy, and for the time fast.  You could tell Venom were influenced by the hardcore punk scene happening at the time, and did several shows with Black Flag back in the day.  The problem is that Venom can barely play their instruments, the drummer freaking SUCKS, and the songs just aren't very good.  Did they have something against tuning their f-ing guitars?  The satanism is so obviously done for shock value that it comes off as campy and just stupid: ooh scarey Mr. Satan.  I know it's done purely for entertainment but they just don't pull it off.  As a historical document I can understand its importance and Venom's influence on other bands, but musically Welcome to Hell just doesn't stand up: it sounds dated and very sloppy.  If you want to hear the roots of black metal played by people who could both play and write good songs I suggest buying some Bathory (The Return...) or getting some early Celtic Frost or even Mercyful Fate.  Skip this tired pseudo satanic crap or if you must have it, download it.
B000002A3T|5.0|A TERRIFIC CD AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF ROGER WATERS AND CONTAINING MY FAVOURITE SONG MAROONED.VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.5 STARS.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|Seriously, anyone who has followed Chantal Kreviazuk's music/songwriting/singing must agree with me,that Avril's new album is fully Chantal influenced and inspired! Which is great 'cause they're both Amazing Canadian Talent!! You can hear &quot;Chantal&quot; in the writing, music arrangment and in Avril's voice which she sometimes inmitates!!  Very good Album, much more mature then the last....more songwriting and melodic driven!! (Chantal influence I suppose) So, even if you're not an Avril Fan, this is a great &quot;Chantal Kreviazuk&quot; Album as well!!! Go get it!!
B000002UA0|5.0|THE GREAT DEBUT CD FROM THIS LEGENDARY ROCK BAND FEATURING ARNOLD LAYNE  AND SEE EMILY PLAY. AWESOME ,WISH ICOULD GIVE THIS TEN STARS.
B00005T30L|5.0|Focusing on the themes of friendship, loyalty, dreams, the future, and the quirks of a teen's life, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is an exciting adventure leading insight into the life of a newly graduated teen.<br />      The story is about two best friends freshly out of high school. In their search for a future they would enjoy, they run across opposition from their parents and peers. They are trying to find a place where they belong in the world. Focusing on one of the girls, it portrays her inner tumult about the decisions she must make. This girl meets an older eccentric man and decides to befriend him and add color to his life. She feels sorry for this man and feels she can help him. She ends up falling in love with him even though she is 18 and he is 40. Through trying to help this man she has only complicated her own life more. When the man she is helping falls in love with a woman his own age (who the girl has set him up with) the girl sabotages the relationship and ends up ruining her friendship with the older man too. She becomes very depressed and dissatisfied with her life at this point. Her best friend is pressuring her to get a job and move into an apartment with her. She doesn't feel ready for this choice yet and holds back. Meanwhile on the home front her father has told her he is going to marry someone who she hates. At this point she is very displeased with her own actions and with the people around her. Finally she decides to follow her own dreams. She finds a random bus and gets on it. This has always been her dream to do and she finally does it. <br />       This movie portrays an interesting aspect to all of our lives. I think at some point this is what everyone wants to do. Just get on a bus and leave all your cares behind. This story really brings about a human connection between the characters that makes you feel as if you know them. I think the author, through this story, is trying to express his concern for the world. He shows one lone girl and the weight of her problems and a lonely man. The author is trying to tell others to just follow their own dreams instead of trying to live someone else's life for them. I think the author is hoping that when people watch this they will try to relate it to their own lives and make better choices themselves.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|Been a ZZ Top fan for a long time, and I'm one of the people who likes both their early stuff, and the stuff in the Eliminator / Afterburner period (it seems most ZZ Top fans don't like both, just one era or the other).  Anyway, if you don't own ZZ Top at all, this is the one to get, as you get all the big hits, and a few others you might not know of.<br />As usual with a Greatest Hits package, there's always stuff that's missing, and this is no exception.  Despite being put out in 2004, it has nothing from the albums Antenna, Mescalero, XXX, & Rhythmeen.  Rhythmeen is one of my favs by ZZ Top, so I was kind of disappointed that nothing was there from that.  I understand that with Greatest Hits albums, that will always happen - someone's personal preference left off.  I could accept that.  But this colletion has THREE songs on there TWICE EACH!  Cheap Sunglasses, Legs, & Velcro Fly are on here in live or alternate mixes.  BORING!  That's three spaces that could have been better allotted to songs from the albums not covered.  That's the reason I gave this four stars - it would have been 5, and I would have given it 4.5 stars if I could.<br />But that I admit is my own personal gripe.  What is here is most excellent, and as I said, if you don't have any ZZ Top at all, this is the one to get.  This essentially replaces the most excellent 1992 \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums, with only two tracks that were on that one not here, but neither of them are a big loss at all.<br />Check it out!<br />Edit a week later: I found out why the four most recent albums aren't represented here.  They're on a different label, that's why they're not here.  Still would have been nice to have seen the entire career represented.  After having listened to it for a couple of weeks now, it's a fabulous collection, and is a great pickup if you don't own all their albums already.
B00009ATIX|1.0|If you suffer a sleeping disorder this movie will guarentee you instant relief. Come and get it! It was totally out of this world, literally. Solaris belongs in the 60's era when movies were at there worst. Don't waste your time energy or money on this masterpiece of drivel.<br />The only redeeming feature about this film is George Cloony's good looks and when the film ended. NUMBER ONE WINNER for the academy award for WORST FILM. It even beats the Killer Tomatoes and that's saying something.
B00001NFCY|1.0|this is a horrible band. scott staff cant sing.  the muisc is ok. i cant think of anything good to say about them so i will leave it at that
B0001Z53AQ|5.0|i haven't even listened to this cd yet. but i think eminem is proving that he can basically put anything out and people will buy it just b/c its him. i say go for it, he has everything in the palm of his hand. i still think his songs are great even if they're not all hardcore. they don't have to be &quot;real&quot; to be good.
B0001GOH6Q|1.0|I am from the south and we don't all speak with exaggerated accents and we don't all lie to get our points across. shame on you tim burton for perpetuating this hateful stereotype of southerners!
0743243307|2.0|It was dissapointing. It was long and got boring after the first 150 pages. Towards the end, when the Muslim League agenda comes in, it was unbearable. I was reading every alternate page. Nazneen's sister, Hasina's story would have been more compelling and interesting. The protagonist's character lacks depth. Overall, Ali should have kept the book shorter, got rid of the religious aspect and strengthen her characters.
B00003CXI1|1.0|this movie is loaded with occult practices and beliefs. if your child reads these books and watches these movies they will likely succumb to the evil world of the occult. parents if you think this is harmless you obviously aren't paying attention. the parents of the two columbine shooters didn't know their sons were making bombs in the basement...what are your kids doing in the basement after they watch these movies?
B0001GOH6Q|3.0|I wasnt one of the ones who wanted this to win best movie of the year even though all the other movies Ive seen last year sucked a lot.I thought this was a good movie.Nothing more nothing less but I wouldnt pay to own it.Id rent it though.
B00005JM0B|2.0|Cheesiere and less serious than the second was. The female terminator was rediculous, she couldnt act at all. The plot had huge holes in it. It didn't really work on any level. I liked the first 5 mins and the end result which pushed on to a post judgement day era finally. One the whole it pretty much sux.
B0000584V3|5.0|This i would say is the best opeth album ive heard so far. unfortunately i havent heard still life and morning rise, whichi have heard were the best but when i heard this album, it just shocked me with the way these guys can transfer the emotions from the music. they can really feel it and they like to play it. there is a constant sense of fear and depression not only in the lyrics but in the music itself is well. the ripping chords really can get into you if you like such bands like opeth. buy this cd. it is great. mikaels deat vocals sound like goth metal vocals and have a pretty good impression but some people dont liek growling but i guess its the matter of choice. no one can like exact same things as other people.
B00004TRD8|3.0|They went into hyper drove with the sequel to the classic Terminator movie. Big effects, big story, big set pieces, big budget, big cheeze. This film loses the serious feel that made the first film so good. On its own it plays as a fun enough action flick. But the kids does ruin the film. Jason Patrick is excellent though, I must give him props.
B000002UA0|5.0|If you only buy one CD in your whole life make it this one. I only vaguely framiar with Pink Floyd when I recieved this album and was not a huge fan. All i knew about was DSOTM and The Wall and stuff like that. A friend let me listen to his copy, i was astounded by how good it was!!! I can't explain why. Something about the way Syd makes all his voice slure. Something about the long periods of free form jamming. Something about the fairytale psychadelic lyrics. JUST BUY IT!!! But be warned that this album is so addictive that it'll make all your other CD's obsolete because you wont want to listen to any but this one for about a month straight. Don't be ashamed to listen to Bike 20 times in a row.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Terminator is the perfect sci-fi action thriller movie ever. It is dark, gripping, well acted, great effects, great story and timeless. It is a shame they couldnt even come close to catching the magic of this film with the sequels. The extras on this disc are fantastic also. Enjoy.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|This is his best movie yet . someday I am going to meet him and marry him.
B000002MU3|4.0|Monster features some of r.e.m.'s most popular songs to date such as \\"What's the frequency Kenneth?\\", \\"Crush With Eyeliner\\", \\"Star 69\\", \\"Strange Currencies\\", and \\"Bang and Blame\\". What's misleading and perhaps gives way to some negative reviews of Monster is the fact that R.E.M. has totally altered there sound and to a lesser extent. <br />There is obvious signs of a changed R.E.M. from their previous cds, but it doesn't mean that this is a bad album. It's not their best in my opinion but it did sell back when it came out, did it not? You go to a used cd store, and you see hordes of Monster overflooding the racks priced at a mere dollar, but that's just b/c the sound isn't fitting today, and had finally quit murking the minds of all the teen/college kids who realize that maybe it wasn't all that great to begin w/. Not w/ me though. I still listen to Monster, w/ all the other R.E.M. albums, simply b/c I like the band, no matter what the songs are like. Is that a crime?<br />Maybe it was a ploy from R.E.M. all along, just to boost record sales. They knew there was no way in hell they would follow up from the masterpiece of Automatic for the People, so they wanted something new. They made a record that adheared to the music taste at the time. Grungy alt rock. <br />\\"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\\" is a fun song, that is probably the best recognized on the album. No harm in hearing it played every now and then.<br />\\"Crush w/ Eyeliner\\" is a repeating wave of grinding guitars and off beat vocals. Typically song of this era.<br />I don't find \\"King of Comedy\\" something great, especially from R.E.M. Almost as if Mike Stipe is forced to sing this one. It does have a nice beat to some extent. Nice backing vocals from Sally Dworski.<br />The song, \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" is a great song. Somewhat eerie, and mysterious, but the theme that can't be ignored is some of the sexual subliminal messages included. I wonder what the hell the band dreams about after hearing the words here.<br />\\"Star 69\\" is a fast uptempo song about just what the title says. if you star 69, means you call back the last person who called you. Weak lyrics, but nice sound.<br />My favorite song, \\"Strange Currencies\\" is a classic. With a spash left from AFTP, and the rock influence that Monster adds, this song is just beautiful. <br />\\"Tongue\\" is a weird piano instumental w/ Mike buzzing off words I never bother to look up. A nice peaceful song.<br />The most emotion on this album comes out of \\"Bang and Blame.\\" I think this song may have meant the most personal for the band, but that's only my opinion.This song is Monster's representive for the type of sound on the album...eerie sounding rock w/ haunting vocals.<br />\\"I Took Your Name\\" is distorted. The vocals are mixed funning, and the the guitars seem to reverberate back and forth through the whole thing. <br />\\"Let Me In\\" is another mixed changed R.E.M. sounding song. I do like the guitar sounds. Something similar to maybe a U2 song, but that could be far fetched.<br />\\"Circus Envy\\" and \\"You\\" finish the album off w/ maybe nothing too spectacular, but does fit the same unique sound of the album. I just wish they could added another song to give the album a better finish.<br />So there you go. Monster, a strange alteration in R.E.M. but would be the only album w/ this type of sound. Enjoy if you still have the cd and didn't trade it in for a measly 50 cents, you may regret it later on.
B00016POFE|3.0|Like the other reviewers here, I thought the CD of In Absentia was one of the best albums I've heard in years. Not only in terms of music, but also in terms of sound. The record was wonderfully recorded, mixed and mastered (in stereo), with plenty of detail (...)<br />This DVD-A version stands in sharp contrast for me in that I honestly think something got lost in the translation. In my humble opinion, the mix is disembodied, lacks any real punch (particularly the guitars which have no weight in comparison to the stereo version), and the mastering is inconsistent. The first two tracks are compressed to within an inch of their lives, and the bass guitar doesn't make an appearance until \\"The Sound of Muzak\\" (presumably more mix related than anything else).<br />The good news is that the sound improves as the disc progresses, so that by the time \\"Strip the Soul\\" plays, were in the ballpark in terms of mix cohesion and a lessening of over-compression on the tracks.  <br />I was really hoping to be blown away by this disc. Alas, I'm not. However, the inclusion of the bonus tracks made the purchase worth it. Drown With Me is a great tune! Chloroform and Futile are really good as well.<br />Do I recommend this disc? Yes, with certain reservations. My complaints have more to do with the sound quality than anything else. The music is still sensational, AND there's a standard stereo version on the disc as well (just a 48K version of the CD release, which allows for direct comparisons of the original and the new). Finally, there's a DTS 5.1 version which will play in DVD-Video players (for those of you without DVD-Audio players). Lots of bang for the buck. I just wish the sound could have been a bit better.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm sad to admit I'm one of the folks that saw Firefly, became somewhat confused, and largely stopped watching. I gave it a second chance on DVD, and found it all made sense (and was incredibly entertaining).<br />Because Fox did not show the pilot until the end, the first episode that aired tried to establish 9 different characters, and it was just too much to take in. (Fox also refused to air the show in widescreen as the creators intended).  Then Fox aired the episodes out of order.  To make it harder for the viewer, the show presents a completely new universe that fails to follow many Sci-Fi conventions, and it may seem strange that people still ride horses on some recently terraformed planets and the characters often curse in chinese (But check out the Alliance flag, its a combo of the American and Chinese flags--something not pointed out by the characters on the show, its just there to be figured out.)  Fox just made it impossible for the series to be understood by refusing to present it the way it was meant to be shown.<BR>  <BR>The DVD set has everything in order, 3 missing eps, and some amazing commentaries.  Unfortunately, now that I know how good the show was I am sorry that it was cancelled.  Its a great DVD set though, and I recommend it for anyone that likes Joss Whedon's work (Buffy and Angel) or that appreciates science fiction, or just likes to be entertained with something other than &quot;reality&quot; TV.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A tremendous musical score and phenomenal vocal talents make this a must have album.  Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel prove their worth on this cd with great songs like &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; and &quot;For Good&quot; shows their vocal talent belong on Broadway. This Musical produces all the key elements of a great show and the album is a equal portion of the brilliance of Stephen Schwartz
0449002632|4.0|The story is about the population of London starting way way back in the tribal Celtic days.  It traces several family lines through to present day.  There is a story vignette for different stages and ages.  I thought the first ones were the best and that some of the ones in the middle read more like a history book being somewhat weak on story.  Consequently I put the book down half read several years ago and only now got around to reading it all the way through.  In the end I liked the book very much.
B000089RVX|4.0|You rarely see debut albums this impressive.  Amy Lee's voice is beautiful, and all the musicians in the band can REALLY play.  The lyrics are extremely sophisticated.  Amy Lee and Ben Moody are great songwriters.  The melodies are beautiful, too.  This is a GREAT album!
B00005V9HH|5.0|I was blown away by the ending of this movie. It was just great. 5 guys have been set up by someone they don't know even exists, someone they're still afraid of. They are ordered to do the impossible, or be killed. Great movie. 95/100 for me
B0001UL7RY|3.0|Avril Lavigne has matured greatly since her last album, Let Go.  The songs are much more melodic.  The lyrics aren't GREAT, but they're a lot more sophisticated than the lyrics on Let Go.  Overall, this is a really good pop album, and I'm looking forward to Avril Lavigne's next album!
B000084T18|1.0|Isn't it sad when the ARTIST puts on two tight songs on his/her cd and then fills the rest of the cd with crap? And I'm just trying to make a point cause their ain't NO good songs on here. ;) In Da Club has got the slowest beat goin how can anyone get down to this?? If 50 is a rapper then so am I! He's not rappin he's conversing with me. I'm sure that's the pace he talks with. There's no love on this cd. We've all had it rough but not all of us get record deals and a million dollars for our no talent bootays! Why don't you check out Eric B and Rakim?? Put the needle on the record yo!!!
B00005JN0A|5.0|This mayb one of the top 3 movies of 2004,I just watched it, and I loved it.It's like American Pie and Road Trip, better than Road Trip, the same has American Pie.Get this movie if u didnt see, its worth watching and buying.Awesome movie for 2004.
038533348X|5.0|I first read this book in Jr. High, and have read it several times since.  It has been one of the most influencial books in my life.  It's a great read, fascinating in many respects, and blends politics and religion, which makes it still as relevant today, if nor more so.
B000089RVX|2.0|You can listen this album from start to finish and think you'll just listened to the one song for 40 minutes. Unfortunantly, all the songs blend into one another and tho this album has the chart-topping singles 'My Immortal' and 'Bring Me To Life' thats about all it's worthy of.<br />Personally, I've listened to it a couple of times and now I've ripped those two singles from the cd I listen to them in compilations with other songs on my computer, but the CD just sits and gathers dust.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I loved Jagged Little Pill, but this surpasses it with many different music styles and instruments. Her vocals are much more controlled and the lyrics to these songs are much deeper. The songs I love the most are &quot;Front Row&quot; Baba&quot; and &quot;The Couch&quot; and I lyk a little of &quot;Cant Not&quot;. If ur not a fan of alanis, i wouldnt suggest bying this album, but if u r BYE IT!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was suprised when I listened to this album. Anyone who watches MTV or something similar know's who Christina Aguilera is. But behind the stories and the persona on TV is one bitchin' rock voice! Stripped isn't a pop album, it's more rock if you ask me! You'll know the songs from hearing them on the radio and when you hear them in context of the album you'll like them even more. You'll be dancin and singin in no time.    The songs themselves are also original for Christina. Not like the junk she was singing like Jeanie in a Bottle. And they couldn't be furthur from the happy-chappy Christmas album she released! This is about a sexy talented woman that needs to be heard.    Forget all the gossip that floats around thanks to those trash magazines and just listen for yourself to this greatly talented singer, you'll be impressed I guarantee it!
055321263X|5.0|A friend of mine bought this book for me for Christmas and I was a little on the disappointed side. I thought from the blurb on the back and the time period the book is from that it would be long winded and dull. I was SO wrong! This book is literally non-stop excitement. Every page was chocked full of mystery and suspense and the characters were among the most interesting I've ever read about. Particularly the villain. He is without a doubt amongst the most evil and manipulative characters I've ever read about. This one is a must read!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This album is pretty good. Its great that Bruce and Adrian are back. Maiden goes back to their old self. Now the songs are good but have problems with repetition in their chorus'. Another problem are the epics. Most old Maiden epics are excellent. This album has 3 big ones, and they're rather boring in my opinion. Since there are 3 guitarists most songs pull off some great solos, so thats a good thing. Most of the songs here are slower than the old, fast songs from the past.<br />1. THE WICKER MAN (10/10)<br>My second favorite opener. It starts with a cool riff and then the drums come in well. Bruce sings this song very nicely. His voice is powerful when he sings the chorus. Speaking of chorus, its extremely catchy! This is my favorite song on the album.<br />2. GHOST OF THE NAVIGATOR (9.75/10)<br>This song is good. The lyrics are interesting. Has a nice solo. The chorus is cool and has some cool riffs in it.<br />3. BRAVE NEW WORLD (7.75/10)<br>Not a bad song. I like how the song builds up during the beginning and Bruce's voice gets more powerful and the riffs go off. The chorus is repetitive though.<br />4. BLOOD BROTHERS (8.75/10)<br>This song has a cool beat when Bruce is singing. Bruce sings it moody and very well. Guitars are awesome here. Chorus suffers repetition.<br />5. THE MERCENARY (8/10)<br>This song is much faster than the others. Sweet riffs throughout the entire song. The chorus sounds good but gets repetitive.<br />6. DREAM OF MIRRORS (8/10)<br>First big epic. Decent guitar work in the beginning. I like how the song speeds up a little bit with some riffs then gets softer again. Bruce sings &quot;I only dream in black and white&quot; too many times. Its 9 and a half minutes long so it gets kind of boring after a while.<br />7. THE FALLEN ANGEL (9/10)<br>Second best song on here. Shortest song but its cool. The guitars are good since there's some nice solos. The chorus is actually pretty good and catchy.<br />8. THE NOMAD (7.5/10)<br>Second big epic.I don't like this song that much, its my least favorite. Its cool that it has a middle eastern theme to it. The middle of the song is an instrumental full of great solo work from all the guys. Of course the chorus gets repetitive even though Bruce sings it well. Too long of a song (9 minutes).<br />9. OUT OF THE SILENT PLANET (9/10)<br>This song has some nice guitar work. The chorus is not bad for a change and has some sweet solos afterwards.<br />10. THE THIN LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND HATE (8.25/10)<br>Third big epic. The first half consists singing that seems rather unenthusiastic. The second half great. It's an instrumental part and has some sweet solos. The best part is when that very nice solo is played then Bruce sings the thin line between love and hate really nice and powerfully just as the guitar solo played the notes. Thats cool.<br />Its a good album. Better than most of the '90s albums. Give it a chance too. Most songs seem really annoying at first then they grow on you. I still recommend any of the '80s albums over this, except Piece of Mind.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This is metal at a next level. I know they sell well, are very popular and will headline Slayer in a North-American tour in August 2004. WOW ! This IS metal at a new level. And this Rick Rubin produced release sounds just like a brick in your face. The first time I heard it was just amazing ! I'm at my 10th listening and can't stop ! Already the metal release of the summer !!! Try it and be AFRAID !!!!!
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I like to know the ending of a story.  I couldn't hear Bill Murray's last lines, spoken into the ear of his young friend, even after re-running the scene a couple of times.  So I don't know what happened or what they intended for the future.  Very disappointing.<br />Cinematography was excellent though, and music too.
B0001UZZWW|5.0|Shrek is so funny. It starts with our hero Shrek(Mike Myers)who is a pretty amiable sort of ogre whose only goal in life is to live and let live. That is until Lord Farqaard (John Lithgow)tries to capture all of the fairy tale creatures, who happen to find solace in Shrek's swamp. An outraged Shrek demands that Lord Farquaard remove the creatures. They strike up a deal that if Shrek rescues the beautiful damsel Fiona (Cameron Diaz)from her fiery keep for Lord Farqaard, then he would remove the fairy tale things.<br />  So off goes Shrek, with his noble steed Donkey. A excessive talking donkey who lacks the capacity to be still even for a moment. They reach the keep which happens to be guarded by a female dragon who falls madly in love with Donkey. The princess is rescued and brought back to Lord Farqaard. But trouble pops up, Fiona has fallen in love with Shrek. But can she make him love her just in time before she marries Farqaard?<br />  A romantic antidoce that never lets you stop laughing. A clean and wholesome film for the whole family. A must see
0375713751|2.0|I respect and enjoy Oprah but I continually am disappointed in her book picks. I guess we are on different pages so to speak as far as literature is concerned.<br />The woman in this story does try to have it all with Marriage, kids and work but her choices obviously are tearing her apart and then the introduction of infidelity disappoints and ruins the hope the book would end well. I know it's just a story so I'll just say \\"bad choice\\". It drug for pages and finally stops, but doesn't end. Wish I had my 20 something dollars back.<br />I really don't recommend this one. Sorry Oprah.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I love this movie because of the adorable little donkey. He is so cute! He is obnoxious, yet adorable and friendly. He is also the most underrated character in the movie. Shrek and Fiona would not have been anywhere without all Donkey's loving, sweet help. I say let's band together and give Donkey the respect he deserves.
0800141601|4.0|First Knight isn't faithful at all to the story of Arthur and the costumes, lighting, and settings were all terribly modern, but the story itself was well done enough that the movie makes up for the rest of it.<br />It follows the story of Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot and thier journey from the time Quinevere and Lancelot meet by chance as her carraige is ambushed on her way to marry Arthur, through some more kidnappings, a wedding, and a knighthood, to the death of Arthur.  Lancelot, who begins as a mercenary, grows a great deal as a character, while Guinevere's struggle to control her feelings for him is painfully clear. Sean Connery's Arthur is the kind of king one would expect of Arthur, kind, understanding, with a rigid set of morals that he cannot break even for his queen.  Julia Ormond makes it clear that Guinevere loves both men and Richard Gere's sensitive performance and longing looks tug the heartstrings.<br />In essense, it is the acting and the love story that make this movie enjoyable.  It is a remarkably un-historically accurate movie and there is not much in common, aside from the names, with the traditional Arthur legends, but these old stories are made to be interpreted.  The romance of the movie is what makes it worth watching...that a Richard Gere looks really, really good.
B000001F3C|5.0|U2 never topped this incomparable classic. On every track, they showed their talent and musical genius. They mixed the new wave sounds with hard, distortion-driven guitars, making them one of the best bands to come out of that glorious decade that was the 1980's. All of my favorite U2 songs are on this album including 'New Years Day', 'Sunday Bloody Sunday', and 'Seconds...'. This album, in my opinion, is far better than the somewhat overreted Joshua Tree album. This is an essential for any true 80's music fan.
6305558167|2.0|I'm surprised at the rave reviews that Excalibur got.  I had trouble just watching the whole movie, and I found myself wishing it would just end so I could go do something worthwhile.  Where do I begin?<br />The acting, especially in the beginning with Uther and Igraine was terrible.  The man who played Uther, Gabriel Bryne, for some reason, seemed to think that it was neccesary to shout every single line he had.  After about five minutes of this, I was ready to kill him.  Very odd really, because I've seen him in other things and been impressed by his acting.  In this movie I found myself wanting to punch the mute button.  Merlin wasn't much better, everything he said he intoned as if it were a spell.  Though the acting improved, slightly, once Uther croaked it, it wasn't by much.  The story of Lancelot and Guinevere felt very contrived, the second scene they were in together he told her how much he loved her, and I found myself wondering...'where the heck did that come from?'  Morganna, who was supposed to be evil, came off as a spoiled little girl most of the time, and in the beginning her bouts of evil seemed very off kilter with her behavior the rest of the time.  Liam Neeson, who was Gawain,was the only person in the entire movie, who wasn't laughable, I think.  The longing looks between Guinever and Lancelot were so cheesy I wanted to stuff them both down a well, and Arthur himself was embarrassingly forgetable.  Ick.<br />This movie wasn't even historically accurate.  Supposedly it took place in the dark ages, but all of the knights were running around in plate armour, the kind worn in the late middle ages. And the women...oh goodness...let's see, Morganna wore her hair in a high ponytail, and Guinevere's was so puffy she looked like she'd been electrocuted.  Of course, she did dress it up sometimes, by having a scarf tied sideways over her head, or somtimes she had what looked like tinsel from a Christmas tree in it.  Their clothing was no better.  Morgannawore fishnets and Guinevere wore one gown made of patchwork.  I suppose, looking on the goodside of it all, at least they wore dresses.  Hmmm.<br />Generally I would say it is a strength to keep to the orginial story, and Exaclibur follows Le Morte de Arthur pretty well. But the watcher gets lost in the bad acting, bad costumes, and random gore and sex scenes inserted for no real reason.  And Le Morte de Arthur is a written story, it is easier to keep track of.  The side stories and quests that were included in Exacalibur felt not only contrived, but they lost me.  And I have read Le Morte de Arthur.  If I had not I think I would have been more lost then I already was.  The movie is tedious and so poorly acted and scripted it makes one want to jump into the screen and strangle simpering Guinevere or the intoning Merlin.  As I said, it was an extemaly difficult movie to watch,one that I shall not be watching agian.
B00001OH7P|4.0|The early 1970's: hippie fashion was dying, heavy metal was beginning, and the British glam rock craze was at its peak. This weird mix of pop and hard rock was all the rage at this time. And nobody did it better than David Bowie. Bowie's mix of piano, heavy guitars, and saxophones made a perfect mix. And on this album, he probably hit his peak. This is a concept album about an alien rock star who wins the hearts of all who hear his voice. Some of then tracks are really weird like the opener, Five Years, which is about the destruction of the Earth or something like that. The most pop tracks are 'Soul Love' and 'Lady Stradust'. The most rock tracks are 'Suffragette City', 'Star', and the title track. This is a glam rock classic and everyone should own it.
B00009V7P8|5.0|All I want to say is that Rice has a really haunting voice and he conveys a lot of emotions in his songs,esp Cannonball.When i heard the song,I almost cried because the lyrics were so touching.I just can't find the right words to describe how beautiful the song is.He is a really talented musician with really good vocals.Everyone should listen to Damien and be brought into a world of emotions.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Russel Crowe does a great job on this great epic film. The story is about two warships (one French one British) fighting each other on the high seas in the early 1800's. Russel Crowe plays the intelligent captain of the British ship, who engages ina battle of wits with the French captain. My favorite line from the movie is &quot;Twelve knots, sir&quot;! This is one of the greatest epic films ever made.
B00005JKES|5.0|The music, the weirdness, the crazy drama...watching this show was like being stoned while you're sober. The characters were as intense and strange as their stories.  The quality of this set cannot be beaten. I've got the entire series on VHS and paid a lot for it, but the VHS version is so grainy you have to be a really hard-core fan of the show to enjoy it at all. On the other hand, this set puts 2 episodes on per DVD, and while it's so crisp it could make you cry after the VHS version, it never needed to be sooooo perfect, I've been very satisfied with other series that put on about 4 episodes per disc. And now the problem is, they spent so much making these that they never really made the profit they were after and soured on releasing the 2nd season.  However, if you were a fan of this show you will not be disappointed in this set. It is such a pleasure to at least be able to watch clear, sharp versions of these episodes, before you have to finish watching the series on VHS tapes.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril is not a good song writer. &quot;Yeah yeah yeah&quot; &quot;Na na na na na&quot; Give me a break, she needs a dictionary or thesaurus so she can use bigger words and not rhyme the obvious single syllable words. What a poser!
0140431179|2.0|This book was a dull book to read!  After reading the first page and a half I stopped.  I could'nt stand the notion of reading that stuff for so many pages.  I gave it two stars because I'm sure its a classic and all that stuff.  Save some time and money and read something from this century!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|When I went to see the Butterfly Effect I didn't expect much, but what i got was an incredible piece of cinematic excellence. Ashton Kutcher plays a great serious role and Amy Smart is flat out Phenomonal! from beginning to shocking end this movie will keep you guessing. This is a DEFINITE MUST SEE!!
B00008H2LB|1.0|What a bunch of whiners.  This band blows. No talent, no meaning, lots of makeup, glitz and glam.  Thanx to all the little kiddies buying this album linkin park is filthy rich, while bands 10x better will never make it to the radio much less trl, or mtv.  This band is more of an industry than a 'musical group', bringing in millions for the record company weekly.  Dont buy this cd. (btw i have heard the cd in its entirty&quot;).
B00006CXXU|5.0|Ithink Christina is the most talented artist of her generation also, her singing is really good. I like her amazing voice very much ^.^ In this album, the song i like most is 'The voice within'!Also,most of the songs in this album are good and the style are special too.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This film is the most wonderful one ever, the story will warm hearts of young childthings for years and years. Do not be ignorant. Buy this film today and begin to warm your own heart with Christmas cheer from Elf.
0425152251|4.0|&quot;Sophie's World&quot; is a fictional tale about a girl and a mysterious character that teaches her about philosophy.  It is sort of a &quot;Karate Kid&quot; (Daniel-Mr. Miagi Relationship) in which one person is teaching without the other really knowing it until later.  The book is a fast read and gives a great overview of some of the biggest names and theories in the world of philosophy.<br />Basically, if you're looking to supplement a formal study of philosophy with an entertaining novel or just want to get a quick overview of philosophy without having to trudge through a textbook, this is a good book for you.  However, this will not replace any formal study of philosophy.  Think of it as &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;: You can't learn all the moves of Karate just by watching the movie, but you can get the gist of it.
B0000009TJ|5.0|hey folks, im a 22 year old that likes zappas work. how odd is that! i know it sounds weird, but i got into zappa from watching beavis and butt-head!!! after that greatful day i was addicted to zappa. this is my first zappa buy, and it wont be the last neither. the covers done on this album are great, done with total originality with the composition of the pieces. i really like the way stairway to heaven sounded the most though. my dad has a box set of his vynal, well most of his works in a box set on vynal and his record player is broke!!!!! so now i will have to just buy his stuff on cd when i get the chance to go to a cd store!!! all in all though, all these tracks are good, really good. if its a crime to have fun while making music, then damnit, what is music suppost to be then!!!!
0345349571|4.0|\\"A Distant Mirror\\" is a detailed, well written and mostly engrossing political, cultural, religious and social history of Europe in the fourteenth century.  It comes as close as any history of the period to imparting a sense of what life was like, at all levels, in western Europe through plagues, wars, and the vicissitudes of everyday living.  <br />While the book claims to focus on one life in order to tell the history of the period, it works poorly as biography.  The story of Enguerrand de Coucy is more of an excuse for delving into the period and is, in itself, more sideshow than main attraction.  This is just as well, for the full cast of characters, kings, princes, lords, popes, cardinals, priests, merchants, farmers, and so on are all so fascinating that the story glides along.  At times the book does suffer a little from its verbosity.  It could have used a little paring down.  Nonetheless as a whole it is a remarkable achievement, and well worth it for anyone interested in European or medieval history.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|why do they need to waste space on the dvd for whatever todays biggest hiphop stars think about this movie? Think is a joke of course, because, all they care to talk about is how Tony Montana came \\"from nuthin' man\\", and,  \\"he's like me\\", \\"I'm Scarface nigga\\". Uh, yeah sure. Don't watch it, it'll only make you pissed. But if you find the producer of this dvd, make sure you smack him in the head for that terrible blunder.<BR>The other extra is pretty funny. Its a look at the tv eidited versions of Scarface. Too funny. \\"Now we sittin' in Bently's man, yeah\\"
0385512104|4.0|Good story teller, interesting story. This kid was a riot without trying to be! Liked how he worked his rules of life and his formulas into what personal problem he was working through.
B00005AQGH|5.0|I love this Album. I can go through the whole thing without skipping one track,now that is a classic to me.  <br />And to think this album was recorded in 7 days.Wow. This wasnt even his full potential knowing that every album was better then the previous one so its scary to think if he was alive(R.I.P) how good his stuff would be.<br />I really reccomend this album, you wont get tired of it...and thats what i like about it....<br />R.I.P.

B00028HBKM|5.0|I went to watch this movie with my parish. As a pastor, my heart was beating more from the beginning of the movie with the scene in the Garden of Gethsamane. I found the movie to be very moving on a deeply spiritual experience, not because I enjoyed see Jesus suffering so much, but that it was just incredible to see the amount of suffering a person could endure. In this case, it was because God loves us so much he gave us His Son. I find this movie to be the best description of the passion of Jesus Christ. If you were to read the Bible, you would see why the movie is so realistic. The Bible describes Jesus suffering to the point of death. I thank Mr. Gibson for daring to make this movie. I hope other people will be able to have a deeply spiritual experience from watching this movie.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|But this verison holds it's own. I loved the first one, everyone seems to dump on a remake but I think this version adds to the first one. It fills in some blanks of the original, it has to be veiwed and enjoy as its own work.After seeing it I purchased both one for the memories,I'm 45 and one for the new ones.This generation. It will be their classic. I enjoyed the remake with a nine year old and enjoyed the awe again,but he has to see the first one for the hole picture. Enjoy both with you children.   Kirk B.
B0001CNRS4|4.0|Hated this, & I'm someone who hates dancing movies, mostly because I don't know how to dance, & I liked it. I thought the moves were so cool, & Jessica is so hot, & the moves were hot too!! I'm going to have disagree with anyone who doubts her acting abilities, or anyone here, the acting in this film is amazing!! Mekhi Phifer is amazing, I really admire that guy, he's funny & he's likeable in every movie I've seen him in so far. Lil' Romeo, I was wondering how he would turn out, actually he wasn't too bad, he's a good actor for a rapper. Actually, most rappers are pretty good actors these days, well, better then pop stars anyway, except the ones who changed into pop stars later(like Jlove or Hilary Duff, they might suck at singing, but they can act.) Back to the movie, if you were seeing this for Missy Elliot, well catch a different one, cause she's only in like 5 minutes of it, at the end. David Moscow is Michael Ellis, sometimes I hated him, other times I liked him, that's the only character I have mixed feelings about. & the thing that made the movie for me, the Honey/kid connection, I don't remember his name. That was so cute!! Plus, Chaz's crazy brother, he was awesome!!     Hip-hop dancing is cool, they should have more movies like this, & Jessica has such a pretty smile, I would watch a movie just to see her smile, she's so gorgeous.     Another thing I like about this film, they don't waste every effort just on swearing, just cause your black, you have to swear. That's so stupid!! Not everyone swears every second in real life, I think it's so stupid when there's tones of swearing in a movie, unless it makes sense(ex. Phone Booth or Turn It Up) but for the most part, I find it mindless. This movie however, has a PG-13 rating, & I like it for that!!     Plus, you have to watch the outtakes, if you don't, then shame on you. It's the best part of the movie!!     It's nice, relaxing film to watch, I definitely recommend it!!
0679879269|3.0|Got hooked on the first 2 books...great books, original storeyline, great writing.<br />This one got bizarre.<br />So many loose ends, unanswered questions and religious comparisons. It just left me dazed and confused.<br />What happened to the cloud mountain...did we destroy it? Is it Heaven? Was that really the final battle? Did we win? Why was Dr. Malone playing a serpent, was marzipan like the Adam and Eve's apple? Is the world now Godless (authority-less?). Did the trip to deadland really have any significance? Why did anyone fear Angels...they couldn't, and didn't do squat. Dust was consciousness?  Where'd that come from? Was that old babbling invalid God? Is the world now loving and kind since he's gone? What the hell was the battle all about, and what happened to the world(s) after? Did the dust stop leaving cuz we won the battle or because Lyra and Will fell in love? Cuz no windows were closed when it stopped, which was the reason they said it would stop leaving.<br />Convulated sub-plots, loose ends, unanswered questions, inconsistent cause and effect relationships. This book was simply silly and erratic.<br />\\"Sacriledge!!\\"<br />I know, I know...everyone loves this series. I liked it too. Loved the bears, the witches, the gypsies, the little people...and the characters were great. It's just this last book was all over the place. Inconsistent and confusing if your actually trying to follow a plot. The writing and character development were wonderful and absorbing...the story was original and had huge potential. It just never really resolved or adequately explained anything.<br />It was like the author took each issue in religion...Death, Heaven and Hell, God, Adam and Eve, and just built subplots around those ideas, instead of the books storeyline. \\"Ok, now I'm gonna deal with death and hell, so I'll send Lyra there to fix it.\\"  Or, now I'm gonna deal with the Biblical view of Adam and Eve, so I'll send lyra and will to someplace similar.\\" \\"Now I'll deal with Angels...and make 'em wimpy\\"...\\"Now I'll deal with God, make him a babbling senile old man.\\" And he just built a story around doing those things. Screwed up any coherence in the storyline, almost as if he didn't care what the story actually did...as long as he made those points about each specific religious issue.<br />Argh!<br />If your still trying to debunk and rail on other people's faiths (which, make no mistake...that is exactly what this book is about) after you've reached middle age, you got some serious issues with your own self. Anger? Or just plain meaness...I dunno. This book was written to piss off religious folk, and show \\"how enlightened\\" and self possesing the author is. \\"I am so secure in my atheism, I can write about God being an evil old senile invalid.\\"  He either has a huge Ego, or is just a nasty person...mebbe both.<br />I have been an atheist myself since 1970. I remember how smart I felt that I didn't beleive in those silly \\"myths and fairytales,\\" religious folk did. I also remember I had to tell them at every chance. \\"Look, your a fool, can't you see it's all just a fantasy!\\"<br />I'm still an atheist, but I don't need to prove to religous folk how stupid they are, and how smart I am. If someone has faith, more power to 'em. If they wanna preach to me...that's ok too. They usually are doing it because they sincerely wanna help, or care about my \\"immortal soul\\" and stuff. An occassional zealot might be a little obnoxious, but, I can deal with it. <br />As an atheist, I was arguing with them not because I cared about them...I wanted to show how stupid and ignorant they were, and how enlightened I was. Arrogant and egotistical. That was me. And that is the author.<br />Get over it.<br />Anyway, I still enjoyed the series. The religious things didn't really bother me, except that it screwed up a good story...especially in this last book. Fun to read. Wonderful characters. I think people really fall in love with the people in the book...I did. Just don't get too curious about what's happening and why, and you'll have a grand time.<br />But, it will upset religious folk. Completely unecessary in my humble opinion.
B000002BPS|5.0|The Offspring is my favorite band.  This is probably their best album.  Yeah Americana had a few good songs and so did Smash but this album is a true gem.  This CD as usual with Offspring CD's has some sort of positive message in their song but without sounding cheesey.  Sometimes you even forget the message and just want to rock out to the song.  Here is a track by track review.<br />Disclaimer (3/5)-This is usual for an Offspring intro and I sorta agree with what he says about &quot;if it offends you then don't listen to it&quot;.  It sets up the next song very nicely<br />The Meaning Of Life (5/5)-One of my favorite songs with a really good beat and a nice message about following your own path and not someone else's.<br />Mota (4.5/5)-I actually really like this song.  It opens nicely with a drum solo.  The song is very catchy and it's about smoking &quot;mota&quot; and being a pothead and throwing your life away.<br />Me And My Old Lady (4/5)-A comedic song talking about his girlfriend.  Kind of reminds me of &quot;Why Don't You Get A Job&quot; from Americana except much heavier.  About how his &quot;old lady&quot; give him grief all the time.  I like the bass line at the beginning<br />Cool To Hate (3/5)-I used to LOVE this song but now it's kinda old.  It's about being outcast and hating everyone at school.  A very fast upbeat song.  Nice chorus<br />Leave It Behind (3.8/5)-Kind of a filler song but I still really like it.  I can kind of just lay back and listen to this song.  Pretty cool.<br />Gone Away (3.5/5)-This is where the album kinda slows down.  The song is very emotional.  I can hear the emotion in the song.  It's about the world being gone away.<br />I Choose (4.5/5)-This song is great.  I love it.  Very catchy.  This song always puts a smile on my face and reminds me of a sunny day at the beach or something.  Just a great song<br />Intermission (5/5)-This is an instrumental elevator music type song.  It reminds me of the beach and it is very soothing.  It relaxes me.  It's kind of like a breather from the beginning of the album and also prepares you for the rest of the album<br />All I Want (5/5)-AWESOME SONG!!  This is the song that made me LOVE Offspring.  When I was playing Crazy Taxi, I heard this song and just HAD to know who it was.  This song has such a good message and a great beat and it is a friggin teen anthem.  Love it!!<br />Way Down The Line (5/5)-This song is great.  A song about growing up like your parents. It has a catchy beat and has a little ska breakdown at the end.  I love it.<br />Don't Pick It Up (4/5)-A nice little comedic song about picking up &quot;bad' things I guess.  Haha no masterpiece but a good little punk song.<br />Amazed (4.5/5)-This song is great.  It puts me in a trance. A little darker than the rest of the album but still a great song. And if no one likes this song &quot;i'd be amazed&quot;.  tee hee.<br />Change The World (4/5)-This song is very cool.  It just makes me wannakick back and drink a Sprite.  I love how kickin it is.  It's just an anthem to teens about changing the world.  What more could a parent ask for??  At the end of this song there is about a 2 minute pause when all of a sudden Dexter comes out of nowhere and says &quot;I think these guys should try heavy metal.  Kiss my ass!&quot;  When I first heard this I got scared.  But juxtaposed to the seriousness of Change The World is hilarious and ends the CD where it started, on a happy light and carefree note.<br />In short purchase this album with no doubt that you will get your money's worth.  Buy with confidence.  I'm sure you'll love it as much as I do.
B000002GB9|1.0|Styx is one of the worst bands of all time.  They featured Hair Metal-esque whiny vocals.  The guitarist was far from being a virtuoso, but you could tell he thought that he was.  Styx are full of themselves, no one should be subjected to the torture of listening to them
0743243307|3.0|I had the biggest problem with the way the novel jumped around. I agree with the reviewer who wondered about white people in England- as much as I love reading about other cultures and the nitty-gritty of the way immigrants live, I began to feel kind of claustrophobic after about 50 pages. The characters aren't always convincing. Ali's style is likely so highly regarded because it is solid. It lacks the flair of Zadie Smith and Jhumpa Lahiri, though. The novel is kind of subdued from beginning to end, which isn't exactly suited to what Ali tries to do with the plot. Overall, this book is better than 80 percent of what's being published today, but I think that's the only reason people are so quick to praise it.
0553212737|2.0|The first 2 Jane Austen books I read were Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility.  Both I considered excellent books, Pride and Prejudice being my favorite.  I had high hopes of Emma, considering it had been made into the modern movie &quot;Clueless&quot;.  However, I have found this book very tiresome and it took me a long time to trudge my way through it.  It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly.  It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option.  I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person.
B0002858YS|4.0|The Killers first album is a success! what a great cd . Along with the smash hit Somebody told me , it has other great tracks with simple strings and serious rocking. If you like a melodic techno rock , this is the cd. for you , hope you all enjoyed it as much as I did.
B00018D44U|2.0|Nora Jones's first CD presented easy listening jazz that was enjoyable for the eclectic music lover wanted to add some mild jazz in their life. This new CD is deceptive in her first release Sunrise you can her the bluegrass influences in the still somewhat jazzy recording. After purchasing the album you discover that with the exception of a few tracts ,\\"Don't Miss You At All\\" and \\"Those Sweet Words\\", it is a bluegrass album what I found enjoyable but not at all what I wanted when I purchased the album.
0027164403|5.0|My 12 month old twin boys love this book.  They know how to lift the flaps already!  It will be great for teaching them animal names and making predicitons.  I used to use this book a lot when I taught kindergarten, also.  We would read the text and then think of animals that matched that description.  Then we would look at hte picture and teh kids would all want to guess what was in each cage.  A great book!!
B0000048CP|5.0|This album is supberb in all respects...this is one of the first where it all began. Quorthon (an company??) have outdone themselves. The production, especially the guitar/drum/bass sounds I think does have an eerie similarity to Metallica's Ride The Lightning...(am I the only one who thinks this??)...This is definetely a great thing though as that album as everyone knows is a classic as well...anyway back to Bathory...this album rules. Varied tempos...and the title track experimenting with the future sound of Bathory's full blown 'Viking Metal' era. I wrote this review after one week and a day of Quorthon's Demise...R.I.P. Great one. BATHORY will be sadly missed but will live on in Valhalla eternally!
B000059TPN|4.0|The Michael Bay - Jerry Bruckheimer formula, like that for the James Bond films, is pretty well set: lots of stuff blowing up, lots of bodies flying through the air, a cast dominated by strong male leads, women are very secondary, a very dramatic music score, lots of foul language and a very right of center political outlook (the military are always the heroes and anyone who questions the heroes' judgment are pansies or some other leftwing radical type). However, the James Bond films always had a sly sense of humor about themselves. Bond might save the American Space program, Fort Knox, Miami and the planet Earth, but there was always an underlying message: This is just for fun folks. The Bay-Bruckheimer films, however, have the delusion that they're actually fighting the battles depicted on screen. There's a lot of overwrought music, emotional scenes between the characters and slow motion closups of the hero(es) walking or running towards their battle with evil. The Rock, in this way, is no different. A team of marines, led by General Frank Hummell (Ed Harris) and disgusted with the way the U.S. Government has neglected the families of those soldiers killed in illegal missions abroad, has taken 81 hostages on Alcatraz, threatening to lauch nerve gas rockets into San Francisco unless reparations are paid to those soldiers' survivors. Heavy, heavy stuff.<BR>However, injected into this serious mix is none other than the best James Bond himself -- Sean Connery. Even in the more serious early Bonds, Connery always managed to convey to the audience that they were supposed to have fun during these films. Bruckheimer and Bay do their best to elevate what is essentially Saturday morning action serial material into Wagnerian opera. But there is Connery, putting all the action into perspective by not taking anyting too seriously and grounding the material by recognizing what it really is: sheer entertainment.<br />Bay, Bruckheimer and company keep trying to push the fact thatEd Harris' desperate General Hummell is a man of honor, a real hero, etc., etc. Anyone who questions his judgment, like the hapless, simpering Presidential Chief of Staff at the first briefing scene, is shot down as a liberal wimp who would never make the sacrifices that Harris' character made for America and should shut up before one of the real men in the room shoot him (I wonder what George McGovern, Daniel Inouye and other liberals who fought for and were decorated for fighting for their country think of this kind of portrayal). Never mind that the General threatens to kill thousands of San Franciscans with nerve gas. Bay-Bruckheimer have stacked the deck by having the great Ed Harris play General Hummell, giving the character an inherent integrity that can't help but make him sympathetic. Fox News isn't this slanted.<br />In walks Connery who, in his big confrontation scene with Harris, gets right to the heart of the matter in a few lines. He correctly says that he doesn't see how \\"you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million\\" and sums up Hummell's actions as \\"an act of lunacy.\\" In one fell swoop, Connery slaps the collective message of the film across the face and shows that terrorism is terrorism, no matter if it's done by decorated U.S. soldiers with a legitimate gripe against the government. It's fairly certain that Connery, an executive producer of the film, purposely torpedoed Bay-Bruckheimer's testosterone toned view of the world.<br />In The Rock, Connery proves, once again, that an actor with a strong enough presence and a large amount of talent doesn't need to scream and shout to give a great performance. Nicholas Cage, Connery's co-star, bellows and shouts like he's on fire most of the film (\\"How, in Zeus' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?!?!?!?!?!?\\" -- god, give it a rest, Nick!). Cage certainly isn't alone -- the rest of the cast buys into Bay-Bruckheimer's \\"this film is the most important thing you'll ever watch\\" mentality.However, Sean Connery, with his charm, wit and grace, throws a bucket of cold water over the entire proceedings and reminds everyone that the film is what it is and nothing more: a technically superb action film that exists merely to entertain ... period.<br />A final note: Criterion has always produced the finest quality DVD's loaded with many, many interesting extras. Most of the films Criterion has released are classics: Notorious, Roshamon, Ikiru, Yojimbo, Charade, Rebecca, etc. I enjoyed The Rock, but why did Criterion deem it good enough to rank with the other films they've released on DVD? Criterion has been selective in its releases and The Rock lowers the bar.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|If any one were to ask me my oppinion on avrils new cd i'd say its the greatest cd ever made. becuase her music is so good and her lyrics are amazeing its un believible. she isn't like britney spears or christina aguilera her music isn't about sex. this new album of her is what the younger music people should be listening to, but not only them but older kids and adults could learn from avril lavigne too. I know people probley think i'm crazy but her music sends out a message saying don't let no man push you around which is much diffrent then what was on her last album. It seems weird seeing avril's under my skin album to be mainly about boys in her life but i have to admit they helped me and their real good deap songs. and this is why I choose to be a big fan of avril's becuase her music is understandable. you don't hear avril say in her music \\"dawg\\" or \\"hisle fisisshle\\" or something. And you deffently don't see her whereing bra's and panties for clothes either. <BR>      under my skin is an album that sets good examples and has the beat songs and lyrics thats my oppinion.

He correctly says that he doesn't see how \\"you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million\\" and sums up Hummell's actions as \\"an act of lunacy.\\" In one fell swoop, Connery slaps the collective message of the film across the face and shows that terrorism is terrorism, no matter if it's done by decorated U.S. soldiers with a legitimate gripe against the government. It's fairly certain that Connery, an executive producer of the film, purposely torpedoed Bay-Bruckheimer's testosterone toned view of the world.<br />In The Rock, Connery proves, once again, that an actor with a strong enough presence and a large amount of talent doesn't need to scream and shout to give a great performance. Nicholas Cage, Connery's co-star, bellows and shouts like he's on fire most of the film (\\"How, in Zeus' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?!?!?!?!?!?\\" -- god, give it a rest, Nick!). Cage certainly isn't alone -- the rest of the cast buys into Bay-Bruckheimer's \\"this film is the most important thing you'll ever watch\\" mentality. However, Sean Connery, with his charm, wit and grace, throws a bucket of cold water over the entire proceedings and reminds everyone that the film is what it is and nothing more: a technically superb action film that exists merely to entertain ... period.
B000002J0B|5.0|I have to admit that when I first bought this album, I had my doubts.  Even Led Heads like me have to admit that there's an inconsistancy to this album that makes it seem weak, but the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.  I mean it's not Zeppelin's best work but it's still a five out of five. Something you half to credit this album with is that it's very diverse.  Certain tracks stick to their classic sound like &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot;, &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;, and &quot;The Ocean&quot;. &quot;The Crunge&quot; has a funk influence that nobody expected. &quot;D'yer Mak'er&quot; has a 50's doo-wop feel. &quot;Dancing Days&quot; is more or less a country song.  &quot;The Rain Song&quot; is a slow masterpiece that mixes string instruments into itself, and &quot;No Quarter&quot; is the song that layed the track for what would become become grunge. You really have to credit Led Zeppelin for, after the huge success of the symbol album to not try to make the excact same thing.  All in all, I'd give Led Zeppelin's most experimental album a 5 out of 5.
0345347951|5.0|Along with Asimov and other great science-fiction authors whose works have added themselves to other great works by other sci-fi masters: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, as well as the more modern cyberpunk works like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|WOW! This album has totally renewed my love of metal.<BR> Only this album and Opeth have managed to impress me recently.<BR> This is the album of the year by far, ignore any criticism of the melodies, this is definitely classic Slipknot. They have evolved and vastly improved. And there are some amazing Solos! (This from a Carcass Fanatic).<BR> Let's just hope that this isn't a Swan Song (But if it is, what a way to go).<BR> GET THIS ALBUM!
B00005JL1C|3.0|The saving grace to SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL are the performances by the three lead actors: Eric Stolz, Mary Stuart Masterson, and Lea Thompson, especially Masterson. There isn't much in this script that hasn't been done before, and yet these three very young performers really pulled something out of it. Otherwise, this is another typical Hughes film filled with teenagers who are vain and self-important until something that SEEMS significant enters their lives. I know I'm in the minority here, and I'm probably just too old, but I would feel so insulted if I were a teenager watching any of Hughes' films. (Go ahead, let me have all your &quot;Not Helpful&quot; votes)
B00005J6UP|2.0|but this movie was way too corny for my tastes. This movie managed to use every single clich that ever existed. This ranges from the group of misfits going on an adventure to save their home from evil corporate rich people to mobsters with guns to a pirate treasure cave filled with booby traps to a fat kid who saves the day to a disfigured grotesque monster suddenly gaining human knowledge and capabilities and rebelling against it's owners to love between two 13 year olds. The reason that I gave this movie two stars is because there are worse films than this one and one scene was funny. Other than that, I do not recommend this film to anyone who likes hardy boys and other meaningless kids detective stories.
B000089RVR|5.0|How did I miss hearing about Dido before?  This is wonderful stuff!  Would that half of us come up with such beautiful and poetic expressions from a deep depression after a romantic breakup.  Dido also has an unusual blend of sound.  A sexy, sultry voice over a soulful beat with ethereal high notes in the background.  The actual music is better than this brief description reads.<br />\\"White Flag\\" is the radio single most of us have heard and it gives you a big clue to what this CD is like.  One by one each song adds another part of a story of a woman whose love has left her-but she is not ready to let him go.  Indeed, she can't.  We are told of desperation (\\"Stoned\\"), hopeful pleading (\\"Don't Leave Home\\", painful memories (\\"Sand In My Shoes\\") and that unexpected period where acceptance alternates with black helplessness (\\"See The Sun\\").<br />This album would be disturbing if it were not so beautiful.  When love walks away and all hope is lost of ever getting them back, the whole world is coming to an end.  There is no \\"snapping out of it\\".  All that can be done is to ride it out.  Sounds to me like Dido was lost for quite a while.  This is one of the most deep and human albums to come our way in a long time.
B000089RVX|5.0|Love it. Great. One of the best rock albums of 2003. I loved all the songs right away. The 2 strongest songs on the album have to be Going Under and Whisper. Amy's voice is so pure, and the music is soft, hard and dark at the same time. Which i didnt know i could get into, but its so good, im into all that now. But the lyrics, are the best part of the album. They're so strong and straight foward, it grabs you. You'll have to hear it for yourself. I would give it a 10/10, so buy it and hope you enjoy! : )
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have never liked her too much, I have never bought her music, or thought of her too highly. I have never considered her a good musician; I sometimes gave her  credit for being a good entertainer. The only reason I had some of her songs (and realized last night that I know all of them by heart) is because my brother loved her since we were kids, back in Europe. I never thought I would be living in DC one day and pay money to go see Madonna. Glad I did. She is not a good entertainer, not a good musician...etc. etc. these words are too lame to describe her... she is someone that makes you proud to be a woman, a man, gay, straight, lesbian, immigrant, foreigner, Arabic, Japanese, communist, socialist, democrat, repu....well not republican, not at this point of time at least. Anyhow, to throw a show like she did you need to know and appreciate the differences. She does.<BR>And the album, American life, in my opinion is her best piece of work, unlike the rest it's not only entertaining, it has substance, it has lyrics that touch to any reasonable soul with a brain. <BR>I am glad I saw the reinvention tour, cause she is truly reinvented, to the greatest levels any entertainer can reach. <BR>My praises to her!To grow in life a person needs to live it, if someone has done that it would be her. The notorious naked music \\"diva\\" from the 80s has transformed into a serious, concerned 45 mother and children's book writer. I can accept her in both roles as the ultimate and best example. The 'pitiful' singer has turned into a musician that chooses lyrics with style and point-that is the American Life, and she is the AMERICAN in it's best. I am surprised I am the one who says this, but she deserves it to the fullest.
B00005JMAH|3.0|The first 2 were awesome, but this one just didn't adapt to the books as well as I'd hoped it would....maybe my expectations were just too high from the book.  Not bad, but a bit disappointing.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|This movie is not great.  It's not bad either.  It's just O.K..  After listening to the commentary, I bet that's Stillers' opinion also.  He states that many gags seemed to work when writing the script but did not translate well in the movie.  You can tell by his voice that it bothers him.<br />The part of this DVD that works the best is the menu.  Each section starts with Derek giving us innane instructions.  I also enjoyed the freeze-frame, cubist, color morphing on the main section.  If only the rest of the movie had been as fresh and original as the menu.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THE POPULARITY OF THIS SERIS????  It's dumb and stupid and DORKY!!!!
1559408855|5.0|I'm giving this movie the highest rating because it made me understand the definition of the word CAPTHARSIS (the process of releasing strong emotions-pity and fear-through a particular activity or experience, such as writing or theatre, which helps you to understand those emotions)
B00008DDXC|5.0|This one was just as good aas HP 1, and MUCH better than HP 3.  It had action, and a good story line.  Beats 3 by far, and comes too close to call with the original.  OH, and don't worry...the kids finally learned how to act.
B00008J4P5|1.0|I am sorry everyone, but these two people are the two most untalented people to ever pick up musical insturments.  I'v played percussion for a little over 10 years and even if I had only played one I would still be better than their &quot;drummer&quot;.

0553296981|4.0|I earnestly almost cried after reading this book.I was 13,the same age as Anne's when she started writing her diary,whom she called \\"kitty\\".<br />For those who have no idea who Anne Frank is,she is a Jewish girl and the youngest of two girls.Her father was successful businessman...and the family led a happy and wonderful life after settling down in the bustling city of Amsterdam,that was until Adolf Hitler started the Nazis.The Nazis was an anti-Jew operation,where they would capture Jewish men and tortured them.The women and young and old were not let off either,many were sent to concentration camps,where living conditions there were so bad,many died of diseases rather than the slow torturings.<br />It was at this time that Mr Frank decided to go into hiding with his family.With some of his kind-hearted co-workers,they managed to perfect a secret hideout.Anne,her mother and sister Margot began moving into the hideout,which was located just behind the office.Joining them were the Van Dans (not sure if spelling is right)who had a son named Peter and a doctor.Life was very tough,for living behind the office with barely a bookshelf as a wall means not making loud noises.No one must know of their existense,so all everybody could do is to crept round their area softly,tip-toeing and even speaking in hush-whistle.<br />For almost 2 years,that's the life of Anne.A growing teenager,she could not go out to the streets to watch a movie,play with her friends or even talk to boys,for that means getting caught by the Nazis.It was also round this time that Anne had one true friend where she can confide everything to:kitty,her diary.<br />In her diary,she wrote of how talkative she was in class(she went to school before the hiding),how she hates her mother when the latter compared her to her sister Margot,how she detested Mrs Van Dam...and her deepest thoughts on growing up in a secret hideout.She also shared about her crush on Peter,who also liked her.<br />Anne,as we could see,was a normal girl,someone who detested writing,someone who likes a boy and someone who wants to grow up being an author.Well,you could say she is one now,with her diary published after the war, which was later translated to more than 50 languages and sold millions worldwide...but the young girl,unlike her diary,did not survived through the war,for she was captured from her hideout one fine day.Mrs Frank,Margot,the doctor,the Van Dams and Anne herself,all died.All except for Mr Frank himself,who survived...<br />By the way, a little unknown fact about her Anne:her real name is Annelies Marie Frank.as a normal girl,someone who detested writing,someone who likes a boy and someone who wants to grow up being an author.Well,you could say she is one now,with her diary published after the war, which was later translated to more than 50 languages and sold millions worldwide...but the young girl,unlike her diary,did not survived through the war,for she was captured from her hideout one fine day.Mrs Frank,Margot,the doctor,the Van Dams and Anne herself,all died.All except for Mr Frank himself,who survived...<br />By the way, a little unknown fact about her Anne:her real name is Annelies Marie Frank.

B00005A1PR|5.0|Is it possible to NEVER get sick of an album?  I don't know how many times I've listened to this since the day I bought it -- how long ago? But it never wears out.<br />Actually, I love it more now than I did the first day.  <br />I bought it, of course, for the song &quot;Video&quot; -- I mean, what woman can resist a song that says, &quot;My mama says a lady ain't what she wears, but what she knows.  Keep your silicone, I prefer my own, what God gave me is just fine.&quot;  How can you resist that?  So of course I had to buy it.<br />It took me a few days to get excited about the rest of the album.  It has a &quot;midnight smooth&quot; feel - ultra polished - which isn't my usual thing.  But the songs grew on me one at a time.  <br />After Video, the next song that got me was the one about how everything in life makes music, including &quot;a tin can rolls across the gravel like a tambourine&quot;.  Very meaningful song to those of us who are deeply drawn to sound.  <br />Then I went crazy over the song that proclaims love of a man by stating, &quot;I see God in you&quot;.  What a great way to put it!<br />Next, I got taken in by the gentle, understated tribute to deceased artists and ... by now, I'm pretty much wild for every song on there, and I never get tired of listening.<br />Let it grow on you if it's not your usual thing.  There's lots of instrumentation and it's very traditonally polished -- not the kind of sound we usually associate with great lyrics.  But this one has them.  <br />If smooth, soulful, polished music is already your favorite kind -- then no sweat!  You'll love this album from the get-go.
B000002P2W|5.0|Long before Pete Townshend started making a public fool of himself by getting caught in interent porn sweeps and accidentally overdosing on heroin while partying with Duran Duran (!), he wrote nine tenths of \\"The Who By Numbers.\\" (The tenth song, \\"Success Story\\" was a John Entwhistle song that for once fit in with the context of Townshend's tunes!) For one thing, it sounds like back-to-basics \\"Live At Leeds\\" style-Who. There isn't a synthesizer in sight, to the point where you wonder if the group was embarrassed by \\"Quadrophenia\\"'s excesses (excellent album though it is) and decided to strip down the sound. And Keith Moon was indeed deterioriating, but he hadn't gotten to the ballooned up \\"Who Are You\\"/\\"Kids Are Alright\\" phase yet. This album is above all, guitar music-probably Townshend's finest. As for the songs themselves, this album is up there with \\"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\\" and Neil Young's \\"Tonight's The Night\\" for meditating on the high price of fame. After all, not all songwriters could write about their midlife crisis as convincingly (or as much) as Pete Townshend. \\"Squeeze Box\\" is the only obvious exception (which explains why it was a hit)...songs like \\"Dreaming From The Waist\\", \\"They Are All In Love\\" and \\"How Many Friends Have I Really Got\\" are brutal, cynical and uncompromisingly honest pieces of work. Supposedly Roger Daltrey was forced to sing some of these (\\"However Much I Booze\\" he understandably declined outright) but you'd never tell from the singing. Yet there are some great lines in the songs, \\"Like a woman in childbirth, grown ugly in a flash\\" is one that sticks in my mind, as is \\"When I first signed the contract, it was more than a handshake then -I know it still is- but there's a payback: we talk so much s--- behind each other's back I get the willies.\\" Gee...you don't suppose Pete had anybody specific in mind with that one, do you? Add a little ditty like \\"Blue, Red and Grey\\" and you could see how many of the Who's songs were definitiveat the demo stage. <BR>\\"The Who By Numbers\\" is a great album, but by no means a happy one. Listen to the music, because, as great as the lyrics are, and as admirable it is that that Townshend not only wrote them but was willing to let the world hear them, they are depressing and very down. Too bad Prozac didn't exist in 1975.
B00009L1TA|3.0|This film is interesting and suspenseful the entire way through. Both clever and well written it tells the story of a military training mission gone wrong from the perspective of several different officers. The cast of characters are great with the best performances by John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, Giovanni Ribisi and Harry Connick Jr. <br />If you are looking for a military movie this will satisfy you but it takes more credit as a murder mystery. It is gripping, intriguing and a great whodunit with a twist that is unpredictable at the end. Highly entertaining and well worth the ride.
B000002J6F|5.0|As a big fan of both CSNY and The Flying Burrito Brothers, when I first heard about this album I said, &quot;This I have to hear!&quot; So I ended up blowing thirty bucks on an old vinyl copy, with all the trimmings (the packaging includes a huge two sided poster with pictures and the handwritten lyrics -Stills' own writing, I presume.) When I realized it was not only a double album but that all the songs were broken up into four separate 'suites' I was like, &quot;Oh...somebody was a bit ambitious...&quot; and so I was expecting something overblown like CSNY at their worst. Wrong. With the possible exception of the first CSN album, this is the best stuff I've heard Stills do- and once you hear the Manassas album, it's hard to think of them as a mere backing group. It's really a band, versatile as hell -this is an album that encompasses just about every genre of popular music you can think of, and they pull it off convincingly (not bad for a bunch of fairly obvious stoners!) And, though he wrote the songs (with a little bit of help from Chris Hillman, Dallas Taylor and Bill Wyman in places) Stephen Stills does not play practically every instrument as in CSNY or his other solo albums. Not that there's anything wrong with that. In the end, I played the album to death, I was that blown away...and ended up blowing another thirty bucks for the CD just so I could listen in one sitting and not have to get up every twenty minutes to flip the LP over! No...what we have here is a double album modeled loosely on &quot;Exile On Main Street&quot;: an album consisting of a side each of great rock, folk, blues and country played by master musicians. And it is worth mentioning that Bill Wyman, the Stones' old bass player, who plays on a few tracks, went on record as saying that Manassas was the only band he would have not hesitated to quit the Stones for. I can see why. If they cared at all, I bet Crosby and Nash felt a little bit intimidated, justifiably so, because Manassas is waaaaay better (and not as dull) as any Crosby/Nash project I've ever heard...
B0001LJCPC|5.0|The soundtrack to Vol. 1 can barely compare to this one, I feel. The music perfectly captures the emotion and drama of the movie's plot and story--sort of how Vol. 2 was more story with bits of action peppered on, while Vol. 1 was tons of action with a taste of the story to keep you going. Combined the two movies are amazing, and so to with their corresponding soundtracks.<br />The most memorable tracks on here are the ones by Ennio Morricone--I've never heard anything so spectacular in my life. They fit this film's mold so perfectly it's like the two were made for each other. Another song worthy of praise is Malcom McLaren's &quot;About Her.&quot; The scene in which this song plays brought tears to my eyes. That's not to say these are the only songs/composers worth paying attention to. It's just that the songs on here and all so wonderful it'd be a bit tedious to go through each of them. Every one is a perfect fit (particularly Johnny Cash's &quot;A Satisfied Mind.&quot;)<br />Simply put, this is a must have for fans of the film or fans of the music Quentin so cleverly chooses for his movies. You won't regret this purchase. Although it's an unorthodox styling (I can't imagine many people listening to it today) it's sheer perfection that deserves to be listened to over and over again. This soundtrack is definitely the more &quot;Western&quot; of the two, while Vol. 1's OST had a 70's Shaw Brothers film twist. Also, since I think it deserves to be said, fans of the Cowboy Bebop anime series should pick this up for kicks. The music is strangely similar and has the same feel as the show. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B000002JSJ|5.0|&quot;Presence&quot; is probably the greatest example of a band working under enourmous pressure and rising to the occasion. At the time, 1975, Zeppelin was forced to do a major rethink considering Robert Plant just about didn't walk again after a car accident, and Jimmy Page was just starting his Keith Richards-like descent into heroin addiction. But musicians are often compelled to go with what they do best, so they wrote some songs, went into the studio and knocked off this electric guitar TOUR DE FORCE in about seventeen days. That's recording the basics, overdubs and mixing, folks (The Stones were coming in to recut &quot;Black And Blue&quot; as soon as Zeppelin was done and they were shocked at Zeppelin's efficiency!) Now, there is stuff on, for example, &quot;Physical Grafitti&quot; that sounds thrown together, but the seven &quot;Presence&quot; tracks excel. Jimmy Page did the uncountable guitar overdubs in two days (to be fair, both &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot; and &quot;Tea For One&quot; are ten minutes long) and there are no acoustic guitars or keyboards to be found anywhere. Under the circumstances, Plant is in excellent voice (&quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot;), John Bonham pummels the drums into submission (&quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot;, &quot;Candy Store Rock&quot;) and John Paul Jones plays a lot of what sounds to me like five and eight string bass (&quot;For Your Life&quot;, &quot;Royal Orleans&quot;). And these are not simple songs either! Numerous stops and starts in the rhythms and insane time signatures must have made the rehearsals a nightmare (which makes the seventeen days of recording seem all the more impressive.) Yet &quot;Presence&quot; comes across as a very confident, collective sounding album, and only reinforces just how good and tight Led Zeppelin could be. Sadly, it is an overlooked album in their catalogue, which is odd, because, to me, &quot;Presence&quot; makes the first four albums sound like a bunch of amateurs and blues-cover wannabes.

B000024D4R|5.0|Technology aside, Pink Floyd musically never improved on &quot;Animals&quot;. The culmination of a trilogy that included &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot; is the pinnacle of Pink Floyd's musical sound. People tend to overlook the album due to the fact that, lyrically and thematically, it is extremely alienating (but that's Roger Waters for you!) Here we have the human race categorized into being either &quot;Dogs&quot;, &quot;Pigs&quot; or &quot;Sheep&quot;. Nasty. You get the idea that Waters was, or still is, extremely down on the human race in general (not just Pink Floyd's audience) and writing these songs was cathartic. Or maybe that was &quot;The Wall&quot;...the trouble is, Roger Waters spent so much of his career in the Floyd trying to spoon-feed his views down everyone else's throats that it's no wonder he burned out. And lost the band to Dave Gilmour, who's much more...positive.<BR>Fortunately, then, &quot;Animals&quot; is chock full of tasty Gilmour guitar licks (particularly &quot;Dogs&quot; -all seventeen minutes and fourty seconds of it- and the end solo in &quot;Pigs&quot;)and Richard Wright's jazzy keyboards (&quot;Sheep&quot;). But even Nick Mason, not the most exciting drummer in the world, seems to be playing his ass off. And though Waters was about equal as a bass player, the intro solos in &quot;Pigs&quot; are a bit of a departure. I say &quot;Animals&quot; is the last real Pink Floyd album because it's the album where they took the sound as far as they could. Every album to come along since then has really been either Waters or Gilmour solo albums disguised as Pink Floyd, and all rollback the sound to the &quot;Animals&quot; era. <BR>Or maybe, considering the album came out in 1977, Roger Waters was trying to send the punks a message, that even old geezers could have a social conscience-no matter how overbearing that conscience may be...

B00005QGAX|5.0|In 1987, Michael Jackson released the hyped up Bad, the followup to Thriller, the biggest selling album ever. Michael actually believed that Bad could top Thriller. First of all, no. Thriller has such an organic feel, it seems so natural. Bad is so processed and well, inorganic, that it could NEVER live up to Thriller, even if it did make more hits than that legendary album. Bad kicks off the album, and it was meant to be a duet with Prince. It's a good song. But the best song here is The Way You Make Me Feel. It's a perfect song. Man In The Mirror was the first &quot;make the world better&quot; song for Michael, and it works because there's restraint. He says that you should start changing the world with yourself. I Just Can't Stop Loving You is a duet with Siedah Garret, and it's great. Dirty Diana is another star, despite the mysoginistic tendencies. Smooth Criminal is a million times better than the ridiculous cover that was made a few years back. Leave Me Alone, Speed Demon, and Liberian Girl are other excellent songs. Thriller isn't Michael's best album, but it is certainly good, and this would never beat Thriller. While 8 million copies isn't bad, it sets the stage for Michael's continuous attempts to top himself. Dangerous and HIStory are great, Invincible is okay, but Michael will never top Thriller. Bad is close to being as good though.
0553573403|4.0|This book is a great example of not having to follow cliches to write a great fantasy book. This is intensely powerful in its message that bad things happen to &quot;good&quot; people, too. Life isn't a cakewalk for real people and Martin's people seem real. I only give this four stars because he couldve lessened some things that were unnecessary to move the plot forward.
B0000029LG|4.0|I don't want to talk about the first CD in this set. We all know the hits. It's the second CD that's the real gem. My favorites are Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow, Earth Song, You Are Not Alone, and Tabloid Junkie. Come Together is also good, but I hate the Beatles, so I can't get into this one much. Stranger In Moscow is Michael's second-best ballad ever, next to Will You Be There, his best song ever. This is some of his most bizarre music yet, and most of it is paranoid, schizophrenic, and angry. I can see that most of the songs were written in a very hard time of his life, what with the FIRST child molestation accusations. You listen to the amazing music on the first CD, then the paranoid music on the second, and you put them together with the accusations. It's strange to see what has happened to this man so quickly. The downside of the CD is that songs like Childhood and Smile are too sugary and saccharine for me. Another thing that irks me is that he'll release these songs, thinking that they will be successful. We want to hear the amazing Billie Jean, or The Way You Make Me Feel, not some weepy ballad about his childhood or a song that tells you to smile. It's not fun. Even with these missteps, HIStory will not be history with me for a long time.

B0000E5PEE|2.0|I have listened in amazement to Pontes pushing the boundaries of fado and folk genres on her prior CDs with her unique delivery and fantastic voice.

On the other hand, if you like fireworks in every song, this one's for you.

Of course, we had the wonderful Doro Pesch and Lita Ford but others were clearly few and far between. However, the past several years have seen this void filled to a very satisfying capacity. We can now count on the existence of bands that are fronted by these amazing singers who add both beauty and grace to music as powerful and complex as their voices. Joining the ranks of Tarja Turunen (Nightwish) & Floor Jansen (After Forever) is Simone Simons of Epica.<br /><br />Epica (formerly called Sahara Dust) have just released their debut effort entitled \\"The Phantom Agony\\" on Transmission Records. This CD is a very well crafted piece. As I listened to the CD, I was reminded of the singer named Annie Haslam who performed for the art/progressive band Renaissance back in the mid 70's. Of course I fear that I am dating myself with a reference such as this but the voices were very similar. When I brought it up with Simone of the band she told me that she had never heard of her before. Of course, Simone is only 18 years old. Yes, I said 18 and she sings like I have not heard in some time. She is also a very beautiful girl, so make sure to check out the pics on the site.<br /><br />Of the 8 tracks on the there are a few who stick out as my favorites most immediately. They are \\"Sensorium\\", \\"Facade of Reality\\", and \\"Seif al Din\\". The number of tunes is by no means a reflection on the CDs length as the piece runs a little over 50 minutes. Not bad for a debut. The music is deftly performed by the group who combine haunting operatic chorals and spectacular metal skills. As a drummer I always listen to the drums, and really enjoyed the work by Jeroen Simons. He holds it together quite well. In addition to Simone's high pitched Arias there is the male vocal by Mark Jansen. He uses the growls so prevalent in a lot of Black Metal. At the same time he is providing some serious guitar shredding. After Forever fans might miss his playing, but I think they will enjoy his new band quite a bit. Epica, by the labels title of them is considered Epic Gothic Metal, yet it is not as gloomy as some Goth pieces I have heard. The opening sequence \\"Adyta\\" gives the feel of some religious service or foreboding chant as it begins with a very dramatic choir piece.<br /><br />Packaging wise, the CD comes with a fully detailed booklet, lyrics and photos and some great artwork imagery. Like other releases, this comes in a limited-edition Ecobook version, but I did not have this for review purposes. I enjoy extensive liner notes and lyrics, especially in these high priced music retail markets and the listener should get the most for their money. As I described in my After Forever review, the fans of Nightwish will be able to enjoy this group since the music is similar enough to be appreciated by them, however it is different enough to be enjoyed as a totally separate entity. It is a group that I hope tours in the United States for I think they will be a welcome change.<br /><br />Epica is:<br />Simone Simons - Mezzo - Soprano<br />Mark Jansen - Guitars, Grunts, and Screams<br />Ad Sluijter - Guitars<br />Geon Janssen - Synths & Piano<br />Yves Huts - Bass<br />Jeroen Simons - Drums and Percussion<br /><br />There are also some considerable Orchestrations as the band employs Violins, Cellos and Violas on the CD. There is also an Epica choir. The list of contributors on that end was too vast for me to provide, so please refer to the band site.<br /><br />Epica Official Site: [...]might miss his playing, but I think they will enjoy his new band quite a bit.

1400032717|5.0|Some years ago Sue Townsend wrote a book called the adventures of Adrian Mole aged 13 ¾. It was based on one joke and that was Adrian's total inability to see the reality of what was happening in the world. He went along not realising that his mother was having an affair or that his life was collapsing around him. It was harmless and one of the funniest books to come out in years. <br />This book is a little like it. Instead of the hero being self absorbed and thick, the hero of this book is a young autistic child. A mathematical genius but a person who does not have the slightest ability to understand human beings and to pick up the subtle signs of what is going in their world. This book like Adrian Mole is funny. However there is something in it which is infinitely sad. Christopher the main character can never understand the very real depth of commitment and love that his working class dad has for him. Unlike Adrian Mole towards the end it becomes tragic, not in an outward sense of some catastrophic event but in subtle interplay of the characters.<br />The book is multi dimensional and is not just about its hero Christopher deciding to investigate the death of the neighbour's dog. It is a book about seeing and perception about the working of maths and what autism is about. By showing how Christopher does not see it shows us how people do see and understand each other. The book was originally written as a children's book but has taken off with adult readers. As a children's book it is wonderfully inventive yet serious and is fine tool for the development of young peoples minds.

B00005QXXO|5.0|Let me be the first to say that this album is a &quot;must own&quot; for any Radiohead fan.  I know some fans of their early music were confused or disappointed by the fussy studio electronica of Kid A and Amnesiac but live versions of these songs take on new dimensions and show how powerful and energetic they can be.  If you've seen them live you're aware of how great their shows are.  I Might Be Wrong captures their energy pretty well and lets you look at the songs in a new way.  The one drawback is the disk is only 40 minutes long, that's 40 minutes too short for me!

B0001O3YD0|4.0|Watching &quot;Pitch Black&quot; for the first time was like trying a new ice cream flavor; you're not sure until the second or third bite what you really think. The original film got zero publicity and a limited release but served to introduce Vin Diesel to an audience in his first true starring role.<br />A passenger spacecraft ends up crashing on a desolate planet. The only survivor from the crew co-pilot Carylon Fry (Radha Mitchell) takes command and directs her surviving passengers (including Claudia Black from &quot;Farscape&quot;) to find food and water. While there appears to be no indigeous life forms, a human survey team did briefly occupy the planet. Curiously, there's no indication as to where they went or why they left much of their material behind.<br />Also on the flight is a what appears to be an interstellar police officer (Cole Hauser) escorting a convicted criminal by the name of Riddick (Diesel). Riddick has the unique ability to see better in the dark than the light. While he's no hero, he does make suggestions to the survivors to help their chances for survival. Unfortunately, they're soon to discover that some life form forced the survey team to consider leaving once night arrives.<br />A suspenseful &quot;B&quot; movie premise that works primarily due to Twohy's sharp, taunt direction and crisp dialogue, &quot;Pitch Black&quot; immediately graps your attention with its inventive visuals and intense performances from the superb Mitchell, Deisel, Hauser and Black. Actally, the entire cast gives strong performances throughout the film and Twohy throws in plenty of unexpected twists and turns to keep the audience on the edge of its seat.<br />This &quot;new&quot; unrated director's edition was available previously on DVD a couple of years ago. It appears that the transfer here is the same one as before and all the extras are the same with the exception of those created for the sequel &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot;. We get a brief introduction by director/screenwriter Twohy that focuses on the sequel and a glimpse at the making of the video game. If you're fan of the original film, be aware that a couple of extra bells and whistles were added to this two disc edition to entice fans of the new Riddick movie and the original audience for &quot;Pitch Black&quot;. Unless you want the meager extras about the sequel (some of which will probably be available when the sequel hits DVD anyway), I'd suggest holding on to your money.<br />The packaging has been revamped to capitalize on the sequel as well with an emphasis more on Riddick than before. &quot;Pitch Black&quot; is a terrific thriller (as is the unexpected minor classic &quot;Below&quot; and &quot;The Arrival&quot; also by Twohy). If you don't have this on DVD yet, by all means purchase it. If you have it already, don't feel the need to upgrade and become a victim of the LOTR double-dip (despite what one reviewer said, New Line has always released the expanded edition six months after the original LOTR films on DVD thus suckering fans into purchasing product twice).ion by director/screenwriter Twohy that focuses on the sequel and a glimpse at the making of the video game.

B0001MDP3G|1.0|Well, I finally got around to seeing \\"Cold Mountain.\\"----and I'm sure glad I waited till it came to the dollar theater. I love Nicole Kidman and thought she was amazing in \\"The Hours.\\" But Nicole, take a break--you're making too many movies. Poor acting and ZERO chemistry between her and Jude Law makes for an extremely dull film. Rene Zellweger adds a little spark to this overblown and pretty unconvincible southern accent drama. Jude Law is good---but Natalie Portman steals the show as a widow living alone with an infant. The worst of all---the length. I thought it would never end. Save your time and money---rent the DVD(if you must) when there's a discount day at Blockbuster.   A BIG disappointment.
0380789035|4.0|I don't normally read horror, but who couldn't make an exception for Gaiman? His background in comics and fiction points to him as a master storyteller, and American Gods is no exception. The books length is hardly noticed as Gaiman weaves a fascinating story of a Gothic America, peopled by Gods from the old world in conflict with Gods of the new. His mini-chapters covering previous periods in American history are worth the read alone!

B000055Y0X|5.0|Watching the recent funeral and memorial tributes for the late Ronald Reagan speaker after speaker praised the former President for his part in ending the Cold War.  My 18 year old daughter asked me what the Cold War was about.  I tried telling her about the iron curtain and the Berlin Wall and nuclear proliferation, then I realized that I had the perfect movie to demonstrate some of the fears that gripped most of the civilized world while the USA and former Soviet Union had their respective nuclear arsenals aimed at each other.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick took a chance making an over-the-top black comedy about nuclear war, but the payoff is evident.  George C. Scott in a broad comedic farce?  Believe it!  He riffs with Peter Sellers' President Muffley in a way that absolutely must be seen.  Sellers has played comedic madness in many other films, but as President Muffley he is the straight man to Mr. Scott's General Turgidson, who is out of control trying to explain why one of his Base Commanders has ordered all of his B-52's to deliver their nuclear payloads into the Soviet Union in the diabolique \\"Plan R\\" - the contingency plan which was put into place to allow lower level military leaders to continue the war after a \\"sneak attack\\" had wiped out Washington and the rest of the military big-wigs. Legend has it that Kubrick tricked several of the actors into their performances.  Supposedly George C. Scott didn't know that the film was a satire and played Turgidson straight, and after a few takes Kubrick would say \\"now let's do one over the top - just for fun\\", then used only the \\"over the top\\" takes in the film.  Legend has it that Scott was mad (who wouldn't be at being tricked) but Kubrick got the right performances into the film.<br /><br />Sellers gives a tour-de-force performance in three roles, and the most interesting one to me is as Group Captain Mandrake, the 2nd in command to Sterling Hayden's deranged General Jack D. Ripper. General Ripper is the kind of paranoid patriot who thinks that \\"the only good commie is a dead commie\\", and when I was growing up there were men like this everywhere in America. (Their children grew up to form the Tea Party.) I met some in the service too, and it's not much of a stretch to imagine one becoming a general who would decide to \\"take the initiative\\" and begin World War III with a pre-emptive nuclear strike.<br /><br />The other main sub-plot takes place in one of the B-52s that General Ripper has sent off on Plan R.  Slim Pickens is an absolute hoot as the pilot, and finding out later than Kubrick had told Slim that this was a patriotic war film and that Slim was playing \\"Major Kong\\" straight makes his performance that much funnier.  Kong's crew play it even straighter than Slim, and as their plane gets closer and closer to dropping the big one there is palpable tension that mounts, ending with one of the most memorable visuals ever as Slim rides the bomb down to it's destination, waving his cowboy hat and hooping and hollering.ho thinks that \\"the only good commie is a dead commie\\", and when I was growing up there were men like this everywhere in America.

B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best movie! Great acting, follows novel well and it so funny!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an incredible series that was placed in the wrong time slotting thus leading to its demise.  I feel it is the best TV series to come out in the past 5 years at least.  Great special effects.  I liked babylon 5 but this has much better special effects.<P>OK heres the kicker.  The movie comes out next year.  They have signed the entire cast to a movie deal entitled &quot;Serenity&quot;.  Thats the name of the ship.  Maybe after the movie this great series will come back out again on TV.  There is so much open that we need to learn.  Like who exactly is the preacher dude?
B000003TA4|5.0|I found it funny that someone actually tried to sterotype all Nirvana fans by saying that they  (and i quote): &quot; enjoy listening to Avril Lavinge and Puddle of Mudd. And if they even know of amazing bands like The Smashing Pumpkins and Blind Melon, they consider them &quot;oldies&quot;. They enjoy giving anyone different from them the finger.&quot; <br />this is absolute bull. but rather than get angry or feel the need to somehow prove myself to this peice of dirt, i'll just laugh at their stupidity and feel bad for them. (for the record, the Smashing pumpkins are amoung my favorite bands; i do not like avril or POM in particular, and AND i support diversity...) that's the thing with sterotyping: it just doesn't work!<br />so...for the review. <BR>i don't care what people say about this album, i love it. those who hate it are either A) pissed off hairmetal fans or B) too arrogent and obsessed with being 'hardcore' and the idea that this album is 'overproduced'. (what am i sterotyping people? oh the hypocrisy of it all). <BR>others still claim that this album is too repetitive, boring...etc. well to those people i say: there is beauty in simplicity and the best way to see that in this album is with Polly. that alone is the most remarkable song on this album (besides the hidden track where krist's bass freaking rules). all that matters in the end, are not the riffs that you can mindlessly bang your head to, but the passion and the brilliance of the lyrics. if you buy this album, but it for those reasons.
B00000JLWW|4.0|The movie: great. With a box-office of over Rp 1.8 billions worldwide, this is the highest grossing movie to date. The DVD: very plain. No bonus except theatrical trailer, and the print is letterbox. This DVD simply needs re-release and fully loaded with such features as anamorphic widescreen, DTS, making-of, music video of Celine Dion, and so on. So does great movies like Mission: Impossible and Top Gun. I hope the studio is listening.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Released amidst charges that it is anti-Semitic by those who have not seen it, those that do see the Passion of the Christ will discover the credibility of that charge is dismissed very quickly.<br />Within the Pharisees, the Jewish religious leaders, contentions against the Christ are disputed by some.  What develops is the power of one individual, Caiaphas, who spearheads the effort and who gains docile to outright support from some others within a differentiated group.  In fact, Mel Gibson's production continues to compelling use various elements of differentiation.  Jews who call for crucifixion are the mob and faceless.  They are those that mindlessly follow lies when stirred to do so.  But juxtaposed against this presentation are more striking and personalized individual Jews.<br />There is Simon of Cyrene who first reluctantly aids the Christ in carrying his cross.  He shouts to make clear that he is not associated with this man, an echo of Peter's denials.  But he is touched by the inherent charisma of Jesus through the meeting of their eyes that no crown of thorns or trickles of blood, presumably inflicted according to justice, can negate.  Another, Veronica, wipes the Christ's face while a chaotic commotion preoccupies others.  Before this moment, we are primed that it is her faith in the Christ that leads her to him despite his sufferings.  The counterweight of sobbing women along the Christ's path taken with the cross exhibit that even at group level Gibson remains true to Gospel and traditional accounts, making those planted seeds of the anti-Semitism detractors reach to put there more ridiculous.<br />Gibson's use of the presence of Satan is striking and a unique and unexpected accomplishment of this film, too.  Gibson places Satan first in the Agony in the Garden scene, seeking to discourage the Christ from the sacrificial path.  When the Christ submits to the Father, that's when Satan's tempting presence is both figuratively and literally squashed inthe form of a snake.<br />Satan continues to appear, not as the overriding plotter or a demon casting with certainty the course of events.  No `the devil made me do it' excuse can be derived.  Rather Satan exults in victories over individuals such as Caiaphas (driven by authority), Judas, Pontius Pilate (who submits to politics) and the Christ's Roman torturers, observing with approval, as the individuals remain responsible for their individual freely made choices.  Satan attends the demon children that haunt Judas who suffers with the guilt of his acts.  Caiaphas' greatest moment of conscience occurs when the Christ upon the cross forgives him and all responsible for his crucifixion.  Caiaphas halts one stride upon hearing it, gaining irrefutable proof that the Christ endures unaltered, strength you and I can only wish to attain but fail in.  It is the example clearly given and to be practiced by followers in dealing with enemies.<br />When Mary the mother of Jesus and Satan walk opposite sides of the cross-carrying Christ, it evokes the Catholic symbol of Mary crushing the snake beneath her foot although that ultimate battle is not fought directly at this time.  However, the spirit of Mary prevails even as she accepts the dead Christ taken down from the cross.  She is a constant for the Christ.<br />The bloodiness of the tortured Christ throughout the movie becomes almost superfluous, as the viewer journeys into the deeper meanings overtly evident.  The journey we are taken upon is impressed upon us by the sacrifice of the man.  These are enhanced by intervals of flashbacks expertly used and that define the essence of the Christ in humanity and purpose.  Jesus is a child, a carpenter and a teacher.  At the Last Supper, the significance of the Eucharist is realized corresponding to his own played out sacrifice, making it far more than the shared meal it would have appeared if comprised in one presentation at the outset of the movie.<br />The Resurrection of the Christ is acknowledged as the stone is heard rolling back and he stands risen.  It fulfills that gospel message of understatement rather than fanfare and miraculous.  Nor is it meant to upstage the central portion of this film.<br />If you look for the detailed message of the Christ in one place, this is not it.  It need not be because that has been done aplenty before.  But the Passion that covers the last twelve hours of the Christ's life brilliantly transmits the essence of the sacrifice made and why, and, after all, that was Mel Gibson's purpose.  For that reason, that message, it reaches beyond any limitations that would make it just for believers.

0156027321|5.0|At once scary, funny, exciting, and uplifting, this is really a book for all ages.  The story begins with Martel establishing his protagonist Pi Patel's world and background.  Pi is a sixteen year old child who deals with friends' torments over his name and the constant questioning of his religion.  The story finally picks up a third of the way into the book when Pi's boat sinks, <BR>He loses his family, his world and everything he heas ever known,  leaving him stranded at sea in a lifeboat with a large Bengal tiger.  The rest of the story chronicle's Pi struggle to stay alive.   Martel's clear prose and often funny oberservations shown through Pi's eyes is a joy to read and once the last page is turned, one feels a sense of sadness, hope and pure joy for the celebration of life.  Amazing.

SHE ACTUALLY PERFORMED AL, NOBODY KNOW ME, AND A MOTHER&amp; FATHER/INTERVENTION MELODY. THOSE SONGS SOUND EVEN BETTER IN PERSON HEARING HER SING THEM LIVE. SHE LOOKED AMAZING AND SHE WAS IN PERFECT VOICE. SHE SMILED AND DANCED HER ARSE OFF. I STILL THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IF NOT THE BEST CD MADONNA HAS RELEASED IN A VERY LONG TIME. ITS A NICE POP CD WITH SOME DANCE ELEMENTS TO IT BUT NOTHING LIKE MUSIC OR RAY OF LIGHT. ITS A VERY WARM CD THAT SHOWS HOW SHE HAS GROWN NOT JUST AS AN ARTIST BUT AS A HUMAN BEING.THE ONLY SONG THAT REALLY SEEMS OUT OF PLACE IS DIE ANOTHER DAY OTHERWISE ITS A GREAT CD

B00018D44U|4.0|Norah Jones has literally had to outdo herself more than once in front of the limelight. First, by making a follow up single to &quot;Dont Know Why&quot;. Second, by overcoming the sophomore stumble with &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;. And finally, by maturing as a vocalist and a musician without stooping to the lows of some of her peers. In my honest opinion, she has overcome all three. &quot;Sunrise&quot;, may not be the &quot;Dont Know Why&quot; of 2004, but it is certainly a sure-fire hit that equally stimulates your ears and your senses, with its organic soul and its rootsy feel. The CD &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; is certainly that, organic and homely. The music is never too overproduced, the vocals never strained or forced, the lyrics never immature or stale, and the rhythm is always nurtured in the music. The highlights in my view are, &quot;Carnival Town&quot; with its dreamy atmosphere and its moody feel, &quot;Above Ground&quot;, a simmering track with a harmony sharp as hell and imaginative and intimate lyrics (its great LIVE, might I add), and &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot;, a somewhat love song to yourself, very organic and soulful. Other good ones are &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot;, (one of my FAVORITES), and &quot;Dont Miss You At All&quot;. She is not the next Ella, Nina, or Janis, and she is not concerned with being such. She is simply focused on making music to please herself and her fans, and she should be rewarded with positive criticism instead of the bullsh*t comparisons that some of the other reviewers have making. <br />Thank You Norah,<BR>A.B.
B00004W510|5.0|That said, I wanted to respond to the Canadian's post which contradicted the statement that The Band's music is genuinely American, stating that it is completely Canadian because 4 of the 5 members were born in Canada. Right, you can hear all their great Canadian influences like Muddy Waters, Sonny Boy Williamson, Elvis and Bob Dylan. And when the started playing rockibilly as the Hawks that was certainly born out of the old tent shows of Ontario, not brought up from Arkansas by Ronnie Hawkins and Levon. Regardless of where these fellas may have been born, there is no music is more truly American than theirs, especially their stuff on this particular album.
B000003C5C|5.0|Yes Chuck Schuldiner (r.i.p) produced another death metal influenced album Leprosy all about the horrid disease and other things about death for example open casket, Pull the plug, born dead and the rest of the album this album is really awesome and heavy i urge you all to take a listen you will not regret it
B00009TB5G|5.0|Not only is this an amazing film, it is also an amazing boxed set that will keep you entertained and mesmerized for a long time.  Not one aspect of the making of this film is left out as every detail is shown and lovingly presented.  Four discs doesn't seem enough to contain how much Peter Jackson and his crew did to bring this movie to the big screen.  As for the film itself, with it's added time, it is allowed to breathe and develop.  For those who still don't have Fellowship, that is amazing too
B000002UA9|5.0|\\"1, 2, 3, 4...\\" Minus the cheering fans, this is the closest we can come (not including some Anthology tracks) to the Beatles' stage show in their early days. Their story is fantastic if you don't know it; how they went from a rag-tag teenage skiffle group in the late fifties to a bunch of young men playing all night long in Hamburg (and rewarded with speed, booze, and women) until they'd tightened their act up and finally to a professional, exciting Liverpool group that wowed the local Cavern Club when they got back from Germany. It took a few years, but they were finally noticed, signed to a label, and cut a few singles. When Please Please Me (the song) hit #1 in the charts, producer George Martin knew they had to get an album out to capitalize on the hit. There's the history if you didn't know it. As for the album? Well, it was recorded in a single day. And yet, or because of that, it's a fantastic debut. This was the cream of the Beatles' act, showcasing their diverse taste in pop and their own keen songwriting instincts. Their lyrics are still pretty light (though there's some fascinating Lennonesque introspection in There's a Place), but the compositions are outstanding. The album infamously kicks off with the early masterpiece I Saw Her Standing There, the best track on the album and the perfect place to start listening to the Beatles. Next up is Misery, which is anything but. Followed by a lot of interesting covers, including Anna (Go to Him), Chains, and finally the notorious album closer Twist and Shout which as you probably know shredded John's voice (and yes, they had to save it for last). And there's the famous singles, still catchy after all these years, Love Me Do and Please Please Me. Poppy material, like P.S. I Love You is pleasant, and Do You Want to Know a Secret, seemingly nothing more than a silly love song, has a darker side: John wrote it while he and his wife were staying in manager Brian Epstein's flat, where Brian conducted his discreet homosexual liasons. Anyway, if you're new to the Beatles sound and you want to start at the beginning, start here, from the countoff and \\"She was just seventeen...\\" to John screaming his head off, \\"Woooooooooo...\\"<BR>5/6
B000021XS0|5.0|This group of guys is simply astounding. Their musicality, and, dare I say it about a &quot;popular&quot; band, their virtuosity never ceases to amaze. Time and time again, these boys just keep bringing it on. Absolutely unbelievable. This album is packed, chock-full, 100% phenomenal. Believe all the previous reviews, because I can not begin to put into words how good Dream Theater is.
B0000AEKAW|4.0|Ummm. I like this Cd. but the thing is that it quickyl gets to a slow side which make you wanna goto sleep. I liked the first four tracks. After that comes the bore of the album. why couldn't she sing fast-paced songs and take it easy on the slow ones. 'Cause I went and dozed off through nearly half the Cd until Work it out and the other bonus tracks played out. I got up and I liked that part. A Good CD but content needs a little brush up. that's all. She's got a good voice so please don't spoil with sleepy songs which bores everyone. I like this CD honestly. Just hope she could better next time.

B000003C2S|5.0|i have two words to describe this album DAMN AWESOME seriously the song structure and musicianship on every instrument is INCREDIBLE chuck is a genius in song writing really bringing out some awesome music along with James Murphy another awesome guitarist helping chuck rip apart your ears there is some very talented guitar riffage in here as i am a guitarist of 6 years GET THIS ALBUM who am i kidding EVERY death album is unique!
B000007WNN|4.0|I cut my Cult teeth on the likes of &quot;Fire Woman&quot; (Sonic Temple) and Ceremony.  In stark contrast to this is Electric, an earlier Cult offering permeated by songs that, if they had a certain gravelly-voiced vocalist, could easily be mistaken for AC/DC.<br />Make no mistake, though, Electric is magnetic.  'Wild Flower' is an instantly likeable song, as is the familiar 'Born to Be Wild' (a nice remake effort).  'Lil' Devil' is AC/DC bread and butter sound.  'Love Removal Machine' actually seemed like an early version of 'She Sells Sanctuary' to me, but I liked it nonetheless.<br />The debate will rage as to which Cult release is their best (personally, I would lean toward Sonic Temple), but Electric deserves to be in the running, even though it is somewhat unoriginal.  The Cult does well to demonstrate an all-too formulaic 80's metal sound in Electric.<br />If you are a hardcore Cult fan, then you must own this CD.  If you love AC/DC, this CD is for you.  Otherwise, I'd recommend you go after something in the Sonic Temple or Love vein.

B00003CWL6|5.0|Sam Mendes and Kevin Spacey combined the best of their craft, to give us one of the most remarkable american films in any age.<BR>Despite the fact that the movie starts as Sunset Boluevard (voice in off) with the camera softly setting in the house of our troubled man. Think about Lolita  -the powerful film of the sixties - but beware, add it a fine touch of outrageous romanticism and a bit of eroticism in a bed of roses , and then well be witness of the inner conflict about a man who doesnt accept to get old . That critical age in whch the man is able to raise a passion in a woman but he is unable to satisfy her.<BR>That film is no mercy and so our disturbed man will be the fatal victim of the surrounding circunstances.<BR>Dazzling script and superb performances. <BR>The best work of Spacey to date.
B0002858YS|5.0|Saw these guys open for Stellastarr* a couple months ago and I was hooked.  Sounds sort of like an American Franz Ferdinand that came out of the 80s.  My favorite songs so far are tracks 1,2,4, and 7, so check these out.  This is a great first cd for such a young band- I heard the lead singer is only 22- so, watch out for these guys in a couple of years.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|I luv dis cd, it rawks.<BR>Avril yur my gurl!<BR>Da best songs on da cd are...<br />&quot;Nobody's Home&quot;<BR>&quot;Don't Tell Me&quot;<BR>&quot;He Wasn't&quot;<BR>and &quot;My Happy Ending&quot;<br />I reccomend any1 to buy dis cool album, much betta than let go, hunger hurts but stravin works...But I want it so badly I would kill, I got focus cuz these hands are just too shaky to hold...but let me tell you hunger hurts but stravin works. FREE FIONA!
B00013F38K|5.0|I've been waiting for this series to become available for years. Now that it has, it has exceeded my high expectations.  The old magic is still there - unchanged by time.  The photography, music, story-lines, direction - all hold their own with anything produced today.  I can't recommend it highly enough.  My only question being - when is the second series going to become available?
B000267JQK|2.0|Well, I was expecting Seether's next album to be a Full LP with 14 brand new tracks. Now All I get is the same CD I purchased 2 years ago with a couple brand new tracks that seems to be older tracks they touched a little.<br />Those old Tracks are supposed to be Remixed / Remastered. Yet, They are all the same as Disclaimer I with a touch to the beat barely noticeable. Poor Work.<br />Of course, for someone who doesn't own Disclaimer, we can find on here the master tracks: Fine Again, Broken and Driven Under. But the new tracks on here are nothing different than a typical track #6 off some rock albums. only Got It Made came to my attention.<br />In conclusion, This is very disapointing. Will we have to wait another 2 years to get BRAND new tracks??? There's nothing on this album than Disclaimer I doesn't have. Period.
0688145078|4.0|My 18 mo son will sit and listen to this book, and it's the most I get to discuss the \\"new baby\\" with him. If I try to point to the new crib, or my burgeoning belly, he just says \\"no baby\\" and goes back to his cars and trucks. I agree that the book should have a nursing mother, in this breastfeeding age, or at least say \\"some babies have Mommy's milk and some babies have milk from bottles,\\" or whatever. But I like that the little boy in the book is unflaggingly positive about his new sibling, and how much his parents still love him.
0689835604|4.0|My one year old son loves this book it's like playing peek-a-boo with a new friend, This book gives are whole family deep belly laughs as we find Where is babys belly- button? The only thing that I would change is the flaps unfortunitly any strong willed young toddler could rip the flaps right off their hinges.
B000002MU3|5.0|Monster is R.E.M.s experimental rock cd, and let me tell you, it's something else. It's hard for a band as different as R.E.M. to produce something even more different! But they have done it, and despite the bad reviews it got from the critics, I say this is a cd you would be mad to pass up.<br /><br />This cd, unlike the slow, melodys of the previous album, have hard hitting tracks that grab you. What's The Frequency, Kenneth? is a song we've all heard thousands of times before, but it's great, and I never get sick of it! The cd also contains singles Crush With Eyeliner (this song should have done a lot better), and Star 69, which is a fantastic song that echoes at you. Bang And Blame is another great song, but not as good as those mentioned.<br /><br />The two slowest songs, Tongue and Strange Currencies, are in my opinion the best on this album. Tongue is a song sung in falsetto, and is brilliant. Strange Currencies, however, is the highlight of this album, and is absolutely beautiful. It will remind you of the far more successful Everybody Hurts.<br /><br />As for the others, King Of Comedy and Circus Envy are heavily distorted songs that sound great, even if you don't know what's going on. Let Me In is a great song dedicated to a great musician (Kurt Cobain), and the other tracks are all good listening. Surprising is the stunning finale, You. It's a great track that's seriously underrated.<br /><br />This cd is heavy R.E.M., and if you want to explore this rarely seen side of them, this cd is definatly worth picking up. It's a bad way to start off if you're new to R.E.M., however, so pick up Automatic first!
B0000D96NW|4.0|I'm not going to say that this album is Machine Head's best work (\\"Burn My Eyes\\" gets that title), but Ashes is definitely their best work since their bone-crushing debut.  Screw Ross Robinson.  The only musical style change that pissed me off more than what Robinson did to MH is what happened to Sepultura's music.  \\"The Burning Red\\" was one of the biggest disappointments to me, so much so that I never even bought \\"Supercharger\\".  Probably a good thing, since I heard it was worse than \\"Red\\".  But having heard the opening track to their new album on Music Choice, I decided to get it.  I am so glad I did, because this album kicks serious butt.  MH return to their earlier form, in which they pummel you with heavy riffs and brutal drumming.  The only major difference from their first two albums, and it is a welcome one, is the fact that there are also clean vocals in this album.  This album represents what MH SHOULD have evolved into.  Thanks guys, for a stroll down memory lane.  Ross Robinson should be producing Britney Spears' comeback album when she turns 50, not screwing up perfectly good metal bands!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Being a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, I waited a long time for this album and I wasn't disappointed. The absence of Christine Mcvie was somewhat apparent, though for me, Stevie Nicks was always the highlight of this band and with Christine McVie gone, there came more room for contributions for Nicks. The 18 songs here are split equally by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks, whereas before, Stevie usually had about three songs on each album, when there were usually about twelve tracks..not very fair, considering a majority of the people bought the albums for her songs.<BR>Most of the songs on &quot;say you will&quot; are old songs that were never recorded. Most of Lindsey's songs were supposed to be recorded for his last solo album, while Stevie left a bunch of old demos for the band to work on while she was off touring the year before for here &quot;trouble in shangri-la&quot; cd(which is an amazing album!). The vocal harmonies between Stevie and Lindsey are totally amazing and like no other, though this is where Christine is sometimes missed. She did give some balance in the harmonies and the three of them always sounded amazing together. Mick Fleetwood and John Mcvie are just incredible musicians who always carried this band as the strong backbone that they are...and who could overlook Lindsey's guitar playing. As far as I am concerned, he is the greatest guitar ever. When he left the band in 1987, right before they were going on tour, they hired two new guitarists, rick vito and billy burnette, to take his place..that's how incredible he is!<BR>Some of the classic mac standouts on this album are: what's the world coming to, miranda(could have been on &quot;tango in the night&quot;),running through the garden, destiny rules, say you will, peacekeeper, and goodbye baby(which is the closing song to all of their shows). This is an album to add to your collection!
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|Put together a great cast including Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins, add a spectacular plot and a wonderful director and you should get a fabulous movie.<br />In many ways that is exactly what you get.  Penn as Jimmy the family minded gangster puts in a magnificent performance, easily the best work I have seen from him.  Robbins as the haunted Dave, who struggles to overcome child abuse tears at you throughout.  Many of the scenes captivate you as you helplessly watch the tragedy unfold, Dave's face looking back from the car window is a graphic example.  The mood of the movie is right on the mark, you never feel comfortable, in fact unsettled is the correct description as you feel the menace floating over the river like mist.  For at least 99 percent of the movie I was hooked like a fish that wanted to get free but couldn't.<br />My lack of total captivation came at the end after the tragic deeds and the unfolding of the mystery.  I felt dissatisfied but couldn't work out why, later it came to me.  The issue with this movie is it offers no conclusion, it offers nothing to uplift the spirit, there is weakness upon weakness upon weakness - there is no honor in any person portrayed.
0792844882|1.0|This movie is about a woman who goes to Las Vegas to try gambling but instead becomes a prostitute.<BR>If the nudity could be removed I believe this could be an exciting thriller about gambling. Instead it is really just like a silly soap opera with lots of nudity.<BR>Because of the large amount of nudity in this film I wouldn't recommend it for children or women.
B0001Z363W|2.0|I had high hopes for this album and was highly disappointed since The Blessed Hellride was so great.  There are about 4 good tracks but on the others, Zakk is singing out of range which makes the songs sound ridiculous.  Also, most tracks are way over-produced so if you are looking great acoustic work by Zakk, buy Book of Shadows, one of the best albums ever.
B00022LRXA|4.0|2 cents on the music: very good, very wonderful, very Eno. Unabashed pop (Backwater, Here He Comes) mixes with artier WTFs (Kurt's Rejoinder), nervous funk (No One Receiving), and spacier dreamscapes (Energy, Julie). I quite prefer the second half of this album, which in its textural bliss culminates in the gorgeous Spider and I, which is a fitting farewell to Eno's \\"vocal\\" era. As on his previous album Another Green World, Eno makes use of the deft rhythm battery of Phil Collins and Percy Jones, who were both playing in Brand X at the time. (And one of `em was in Genesis, too, I think.) For all his talk about being a non-musician, blah blah blah, Eno knew the value of hiring top creative players, and he himself is no slouch at playing imaginative keyboards - listen to that almost orchestral buildup in Julie With. So, the music gets four stars from me, even if a couple of the tracks grate the nerves on occasion.<br />But if you're reading this, chances are you're wondering about the SOUND of these reissues. I had cassettes of these early Eno albums back in college, I had original CDs, I had the 1993 boxsets...and I figured this time out, we'd get the once-and-for-all, definitive, hi-quality editions we'd all been waiting for. And...er...well, it's nothing that drastic. These are not remasters, these are not remixes, these are \\"retransfers\\"; to my ears, this apparently means a wee bit more clarity, a wee bit higher CD master volume (but not much), and that's it. No doubt they sound better than the original CDs, but it's not much of an improvement over what was heard in the Vocal and Instrumental boxsets over a decade ago. And those were needing an upgrade, if you ask me.<br />The problem is in the original mixes. No One Receiving, for example, buries the drums and removes almost all the visceral punch you could expect from a track with two basses. It's maddening to have to adjust your home EQ/volume to try and bring this track out of its shell. On the other hand, Kurt's Rejoinder puts the bass WAY OUT THERE, and I'm left wondering why Eno couldn't have found a happy medium somewhere. Actually, it's some of the bass/drum tracks on Another Green World that frustrate me the most, but there are bits on this album, particularly the leadoff track, that could have used some 2004 tweaking.<br />To clarify, I'm not complaining about the analog beauty of the album. Those keyboard washes in Julie With sound wonderful to me, better than any digital recording. There's a \\"datedness\\" to the sound of this record that cannot be replaced (or fixed). But I'm still left with the opinion that these latest reissues are not all they could have been. Nevertheless, these have become the definitive editions for now, so grab this album and its predecessor, have your remote handy, turn out the lights, cue up and enjoy.
B00006V9A0|4.0|While my favorite Nirvana song (actually only a cover of a Bowie track, but Cobain does it much better) was originally &quot;The Man Who Sold The World&quot;, this quickly changed when I bought this CD and heard: &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;.<br />This song, strangely neglected and intensely disliked by most hardcore Nirvana fans I know, is perhaps the epitome of the band's 'message' (if they ever had one, which is open to dispute). It begins with a creepy jingling coupled with a subterranean, watery (reminiscent of &quot;Come As You Are&quot;) descent into the darker regions of the human mind, in this case I believe the singer's.  It is compellingly destructive, a raw and honest portrait of his mindset at the time: &quot;Things have never been so swell/I have never failed to fail/No thought was put into this/I always knew it would come to this&quot;.  All these lyrics, to my mind at least, suggest the thoughts and feelings of a man ready to check out.  Every Nirvana song has a certain flavor of sarcasm or destruction to it, but this one hits the mark in a more concise way than any of them.  As far as this compilation being exclusively for money I do not doubt, but I don't really care.  This song is worth the price.
B0000640SB|5.0|This movie is a hilarious take on the whole concept of the Earth being populated by extra-terrestrial beings and two agents named Agent K and agent J are assigned on a mission to stop a menacing alien cockroach who is trying to gain a hold of an artifact.<br /> Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are a really hilarious team and their acting is phenomenal! The special effects are also really cool and the alines are so funny.<br /> Go and buy this DVD and get teh Deluxe Edition because it has so much cool stuff on it! Peace out!
B000000OMB|2.0|Asia was one of the first supergroups to achieve massive chart success, as this album topped the US Album charts for 7 straight weeks. Listening to the album now, it's hard to imagine how a thing like that happened. The album opens strong with the one-two punch of the singles &quot;Heat of the Moment&quot; and &quot;Only Time Will Tell&quot;. And the rest of the album actually holds up fairly well, but as a whole the songs are so bombastic that it overwhelms what would have been an otherwise good album. In other words, even though everything on the album is actually quite good, it adds up to less than the sum of its parts. Cool cover, though.<br />Worth noting: Six of the nine songs on this album can also be found on their Greatest Hits collection, so if you're looking for your first Asia album, you might want to pick that up instead.
0593044703|1.0|I just finished the book and don't understand why everyone is saying this is such a great series, and comparing it to the Wheel of Time and Song of Ice and Fire series.  I got the book because of all the rave reviews and good comparisons, and seriously don't understand how this can be so overrated. The main problem is that there is a good story here but very bad storytelling.  There is a constant jump from character to character so you never get to know any of the characters very well, and it becomes even more disorienting because nothing is ever explained to you. Nothing is ever said about the world, it's magic system, or it's gods. All very important aspects that you are left in the dark about. You basically see what a character can see but without that characters native understanding of the events and are left to figure out everything.  That's not so bad if there weren't so many holes in what you know that most things can't be figured out, so you're left very confused throughout the book with some understanding coming to you the further you read but still pretty confused. So something very important could happen and you don't really understand what happened, big problem near the end. Way too many DBZ like characters everywhere. Really powerful mages are as strong as gods and can kill them. Who needs armies with mages like that around. Action is done ok but don't expect to see much of it, unless its uber magic users going against each other, even that becomes a problem if they do something complicated with there magic becuase you'll probably not understand what in the world happened. There are also somethings that logically don't make sense that annoy me. Let's release an evil god-like tyrant and hope our enemy fights him for us, definitely one.  The ending also seemed a cop-out even before the ending came there was &quot;we're preparing for an even more dangerous threat blah blah blah&quot; I've read lots of fantasy, so nothing actually very original here exceptthe way the story is told and I hated that.
B00009W0U4|4.0|A few of my friends told me about this movie after a late night of drinking and that it was the most twisted film ever made. I decided to watch it after everyone went asleep. <br />From the first scene to the last scene, I could not take my eyes off the screen. I won't bore you with the specifics because it's better to not know anything about it to get the full effect of what Noe invisioned. <br />But a word of warning, if you are at all squemish and/or get grossed out by penis shots...This is not the film for you!
1577311523|1.0|To realize the infinite through finite potential of the senses is impossible.  To become a Buddha is possible but not through intellectual cognitions.<br />Tolle's book heavily focuses on just one narrow aspect of meditation - which involves techniques to bring the mind into the now - this moment.  However, the purpose of all meditation is dropping of thoughts, in other words attaining to a \\"no-mind\\" state.  Yes, Tolle in his book has randomly provided derivative versions of some ancient Indian techniques to bringing the mind into \\"now\\" thus not giving it any space to either contemplate on the past or plan for the future, BUT the effort involved in going through a whole book to gather that is not commensurate with the knowledge gained.  Spirituality is existential it has to be lived you can't get drunk by taking about wine - you have to drink it.  So save yourself some time - from getting on a rollercoaster of words, arguments and logic.  And get busy creating an inner silence so that you can hear God from the divine depths of your own consciousness.
B000002G26|3.0|There was a time not so long ago when Bryan Adams was the biggest singer in pop music, and this collection of hits shows why. The album opens with his trademark hit, &quot;Summer of '69&quot; and keeps rolling through the hits. All his major '80s songs are here including &quot;Run to You,&quot; &quot;Heaven,&quot; and &quot;Cuts Like a Knife&quot;. But of course the centerpiece of the album is Adams' awesome ode to romanticism: &quot;Everything I Do (I Do It For You)&quot;. [Useless fun fact: &quot;Everything...&quot; had the longest run at #1 in the UK, at 16 weeks] Unfortunately, this collection only goes through 1993, so it omits the few hits he had post '93 (a more career-spanning hits collection was released in 2002 and would be a wise purchase for the more casual Bryan Adams fan). Also, because a lot of Adams' songs sound so similar, the album can get a bit monotonous if listened straight through. And the album sleeve is pathetic. But if you need an excuse to go back to the summer of '69 (or '85), you'll want to pick this album up.
B00005JM02|4.0|I must admite that this movie was superb and entertaining but some of the things in this movie are misleading to children who does not know anything about the life in the ocean. A child would get the wrong idea thinking that he or she learned something...so ...parents beware.....
B00000K3D4|5.0|This movie is great! The puppets are very cute,  but if the special effects shots were redone with the technology in this day and age, it could be even better! <BR>David Bowie was excellent as the Goblin King and portrayed him very well. I wrote to a friend about the movie and she sent me an e-mail back asking about the ending. She told me that she bet at the end, Jareth and Sarah get married and Sarah becomes queen of the goblins. This would have been a nice ending, but Sarah does have to go back home. <BR>I would have liked the ending to be a little different, but this movie is still great and would appeal to anyone who loves fantasy things - like I do!
0385335482|1.0|This book is so much like Bridget Jones'Diary in a sense that 1. Book is written in first person, 2. There are pages(letters here, lists in the BJ' Diary) inserted into the story, 3. the main character, Rebecca, is a young British girl stumbling along not knowing exactly what she wants out of her life just like Bridget, 4. Neither Becky nor Bridget likes or cares for her job that much, 5. They both find a better suiting job later, 6. they both find love with guys (Luke and Mark) they didn't like in the beginning 7. Both book ends with the main character sleeping with the guy for the first time and having an incredible time. Now, what sets this book apart from Bridget Jones' Diary is the fact that Rebecca is ANNOYING! She shops constantly and therefore in debt to everyone including her flatmate. She buys expensive stuffs like D&amp;G that she doesn't even need in multiples. What's worse, instead of taking care of her finances like a responsible adult, she throws away bills and letters from  banks, hides from them and lies to them about dead aunt, dead dog, broken leg and etc., and dreams about winning a lottery or marrying a rich guy so that she can shop some more! She does come to her senses near the end, but just when I started to like her a bit she buys three sunglasses from a home shopping network! I mean, I like shopping too but this is too much! While I was reading this book, I was constantly frowning and had an urge to slap some sense to this immature and irresponsible girl with no will power whatsoever. I only finished reading this book becasue I have a policy of finishing what I started. I barely stuck to the policy this time only with the best effort of speed reading. This book is so annoying you'd get upset even if you were sitting under the shade sipping your favorite drink by the beach in Aruba.
B00005JLPK|5.0|I was a little bit skeptical in the beginning because of  difficulties associated with approaching this topic and because my doubts in acting abilities of Salma Hayek. I was wrong on both accounts. The movie is both very well done and doesn't step aside from history. It's amazing how Salma Hayek looks like real Frida. The same could be said about other characters judging from photos (besides Diego Rivera). The movie is a combination of art (almost every scene is practically a statement), romance and political farse (although maybe the last quality wasn't intended). It creates a very convincing and tragic portrait of this very strong woman. Thumbs Up!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|The movie was suprisingly faithful to the book which was good. The only difference from the movie and the book is that the movie had only the main events and took out the good details out of the book. and overall, it was good but, the acting could have been improved. The special effects were really realistic too...it was like magic coming to life.
B00028HBKM|1.0|If you go into this film without a personal agenda, you'll find it basically leaves you physically exhausted and emotionally flat.  If your going to get a faith booster shot, you'll get what you want.  Other than that, the book was better.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril shows her pain in failed relationships through her music.  I can certainly identify with many of her songs on this CD.  I feel her anger and emotion in her singing. (I'm curious if she has BPD however)  I personally didn't care for her previous album's but I really enjoy this one and about have all songs memorized by now.  It's a must have, especially if you like CD's such as Alanis or Ani Difranco!  Good chick music!
6305609705|5.0|To write that this movie is a comment on war or the politics of the period is a gross misconception in my view. this movie like the book Heart of Darkness, which I suggest everyone who sees this movie reads, is a powerfull commentary on human nature. The line 'the horror, the horror' does not refer to the horrors of war or acts of violence commited but is a general judgement and condemnation of the darkness that resides in human nature.<br />Anyway this is a brilliant adaptation and well worth the few bucks it costs.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Superb movie...the actors' acting defiantly improved from the first Harry Potter film. And the special effects are better that ever. an exciting movie to watch if you are in need for thrill.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Thanks Slipknot... thanks for breaking up and reforming as Stone Sour. <br />Guys, this album is worse than St Anger and hte new Static-X! <br />I am so serious... this band has been changed into terrible songwriting and I'm into bands who experiement but this is dreadful!
B00005JLEU|5.0|The sign of a good film is a film that lingers with you for weeks, if not months, if not longer. Spirited Away is the most imaginative film I have ever seen and I feel that life is ever so slightly sweeter for seeing it.

Gin is a former bicycle racer who left his family after amounting incredible gambling debts; Hana is a drag queen who left the safety of her surrogate family after a violent incident at a bar; Miyuki is a young girl who ran away from home after a fight with her father.  While rummaging through a garbage heap, they hear a baby crying and find an infant girl hidden among the trash.  Determined not to let the child have unhappy memories of Christmas, Hana convinces the others that they need to find the child's family.  Along their journey, each is forced to confront his or her own past and what forced them to turn away from their families.<br />Filled with beautifully animated scenery, great stories about friendship and family, and just a hint of the magical, director Satoshi Kon has crafted a marvelous anime film that goes beyond the futuristic action that I've usually associated with anime.  The characters are very human, very believable.  It shows you just what animation can do as a storytelling medium.

0156027321|1.0|This book was so sloooooooooooow and the story was gruesome, gory and boring.  Very disappointed in this book.
B000174LVQ|5.0|This recording is nothing less than astonishing.<BR>Whether the listener is a flamenco guitar snob, a lover vying for seduction, a lonely adolescent, Joe lunchbox cruising down the highway, a too-cool college babe, or a hopelessly romantic cubicle rabbit like myself, this is very satisfying and inspiring music.  Life getting you down? This will turn your head around, strike lightning in your soul. Shrinks should prescribe this music instead of Prozac. <BR>An incredible vitality infuses these recordings, very upbeat. Especially track 7 (Que venga el alba, or Here comes the dawn) with Tomatito and Camaron playing with Paco (the ghost of Camaron visits, thanks to modern technology) - it made the hair stand up on my neck. Even with the little easy-listening lounge piece at the end, Paco pulls it off nicely, flamenco purists be damned.<BR>In these tragic and cynical times (as of this writing, another bomb in Baghdad killing 21 today), it is so refreshing that wonderful and surprising things can still happen in our lives, like this latest music from Paco. How someone as good as Paco de Lucia can continue to improve is a marvel to witness. With these original pieces, the \\"Good Little Things\\" (Cositas Buenas) is a humble understatement. This is a masterpiece.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Ok, let's face it- The Floyd is divine. Even the name- Pink Floyd - is so perfect that it suggests nothing less than perfection within... and Roger Water's mind is apparently indeed quite brilliant... what kind of person could have possibly thought up such intelligently soothing lyrics and music? No kind of person, only a God.    Anyone who doesn't like Pink Floyd is probably pessimistic, insanely anti-consumerist, and a very unpleasant person to be around. *cough cough* eric hamilton *cough cough*   Anyone who could be so blatantly ignorant, so outright MORONIC!    And for those who DON'T LIKE THE FLOYD, the lunatic is in your heads. You'd better believe that I'll raise the blade, make the change, re-arrange you till you're sane!   HARRUMPH!

B00005JN0A|4.0|If your looking to see Michelle Trachtenberg nude then don't buy this movie.  She has a great bikini scene but that's it.  Such a waste - well maybe we'll see more of her in her next movie.  What you see on the TV promos is what you get.  There's plenty of male frontal nudity, however.  Don't waste your money on this one.
0767830520|2.0|This film is manipulative and exploitative. It DOES NOT really give you a portrait of what alienation, paranoia and dislocation are really like. It glamourises these things in the worst possible way ie very, very slickly and with a lot of craft and attention to detail. This film belongs in the same dustbin as similarly AMORAL and empty films like Seven, Goodfellas et al  that purport to be 'truthful' investigations of the dark and disturbing - they are part of the problem, not the solution !
079284131X|4.0|From the back of the DVD:<BR>After 6-year-old Andy Barclay's babysitter is violently pushed out of a window to her death, no one believes him when he says &quot;Chucky,&quot; his new birthday doll, did it! Until things start to go terribly wrong...dead wrong. And when an ensuing rampage of gruesome murders lead a detective back to the same toy, he discovers that the real terror has just begun...the deranged doll has plans to transfer his evil spirit into a living human being - young Andy!<br />I bought this film on DVD without even renting it first. On the way home, I kept wondering if it was a mistake to do that. Well, it wasn't. The special effects were stunning for a late 80's film and it had a very unique character in it, Chucky. The acting though was great at some parts and horrible at others. There wasn't much gore or a high body count, but the movie is still pretty fun to watch. I give it an 4 out of 5.
B00005JLIU|2.0|This film is well interesting.  Julie Andrews played the role the best she could, however I don't think it is close to her at her best...(Her best was Sound of Music, by far).  Yet, she did excellent and as always her voice is lovely.  <br />I thought Mary Tyler Moore did a fine job as Miss Dorothy.  The trouble with the movie comes with Carol Channing.  She played this role so annoyingly I almost wanted Mrs. Meers to knock her over the head when they were fighting, I mean how did this girl make it?  She can't sing, can't dance and can't act...a triple blow.  <br />Also James Fox was a mess.  There was absolutely no chemistry between him and Julie.  (Don't watch Sound of Music before this movie because after watching Julie and Chris Plummer you won't be able to believe that Millie and Jimmy are in love.)<br />Another thing that bothered me was there was a lot of mind singing, so the thoughts were sung in the background while things happened.  The opening number was great, yet it would have been even better if it was a big number sung by everyone.<br />I guess the reason I am hard on this movie is because the new stage production is a million times better.  The Muzzy we saw was African American and totally right for the role...inspiring not obnoxtious.  Millie and Jimmy were convincing and the new and improved songs were not my favorite, but pretty good.  There were showstopping numbers and it was never boring.  So see the new TMM!
B000093FLA|4.0|I thought from the title that this was a XXX porno flick. Silly me. Brad Pitt still spends the entire movie talking like he's got a tampon stuffed in each cheek (sort of like the cotton wads Marlon Brando used in The Godfather). Is this the way these people really talk? And I thought I had a speech impediment. I should start auditioning for parts in movies about Irish gypsies. Still, this was a pretty good flick and I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could. Big Bubba says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn.
B00012FXB8|4.0|&quot;Alien 3&quot; is an exciting, scary, sci-fi film with fantastic, gothic art direction and, dare-I-say, beautiful photography. As such, it's a great film in its own right, on par with its visionary predecessors, &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Aliens.&quot; <br />Oddly, &quot;Alien 3&quot; only suffers criticism due to its relationship to those earlier films. Here's how: In &quot;Alien 3,&quot; director David Fincher tries to unencumber the saga from the baggage of the first two films, where the story arcs of favorite characters Ripley, Hicks, Bishop, and Newt had already come to complete resolution, with each character saved. By dismissing (read that: killing off) all but Ripley so as to get on with a new story, Fincher, to fans, had negated the victory that was &quot;Aliens.&quot; Most of the criticism of &quot;Alien 3&quot; stems from this.<br />Taken on its own, however, &quot;Alien 3&quot; is an entertaining film with impeccable production value, a tight storyline, great performances, plenty of scares, and more replay value that any other film in the franchise.
B0000024JN|4.0|After I first picked this album up 19(!) years ago, I didn't listen to any other album for over a year.  Nineteen years and  hundreds of albums later, I don't listen to this album much anymore, but I still get a kick out of it when I put it on.  The Beasties don't take themselves seriously on this album, and you can't expect a work of art coming out of an act that named itself the Beastie (acronym for: Boys Entering Anarchistic States Toward Internal Excellence) Boys.  They're more mature now, but they were a lot more fun back then.<br />Licensed to Ill kicks off with one its best tracks, &quot;Rhymin and Stealin&quot;, which uses a sample of Zeppelin's &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; and then moves on to &quot;The New Style&quot; and &quot;She's Crafty&quot; which uses another Zeppelin sample, this time &quot;The Ocean.&quot;  It may seem sacreligious to use Zeppelin samples in rap considering P. Diddy's mauling of &quot;Kashmir&quot; a couple of years ago, but it really works well here.  A few more tracks later and we're at &quot;Girls.&quot;  The song is admittedly a bit misogynistic, but the Beasties are posing as frat boys on this album, not feminists.  Next up is the immortal party anthem, &quot;Fight for Your Right&quot; which you've probably heard a thousand times unless you've been living in a hole for the last 2 decades.  The second half of the album has 4 classics, &quot;No sleep..&quot;, &quot;Brass Monkey&quot;, &quot;Time to Get Ill&quot;, and my personal favorite &quot;Paul Revere.&quot;  Few rappers could match the Beasties in telling as engagingly ludicrous of a story as &quot;Paul Revere.&quot;   <br />Though this album is chock full of great moments with samples of Zeppelin, Mr. Ed, and others, the Beasties' next album, Paul's Boutique, really elevates sampling to new heights.  For me, this album is about reminiscing about being an immature, carefree 8-year-old listening to the Beasties all the time.  Although hip-hop has advanced by leaps and bounds since, I'm sure people will still like the simple beats and inane lyrics in this album.
B0000630BT|4.0|This is the heaviest, fastest and best album from Judas Priest. The drum intro to the title track is simply mind blowing. Tipton and K.K. Downing offer some of their best guitar work on this album. This may not be their most melodious album (check out Screaming for Vengeance), but who cares ! The best track on this album is the title track, followed by &quot;Leather Rebel&quot;. In my opinion the lyrics are not that great (What is the title track supposed to be about anyway, besides the artwork on the CD ?) However, the album as a whole sounds awesome.
B000003S5H|5.0|I remember this was like the album of the year in 1998. Everyone was playing it nonstop. I was at a new year's eve party at the end of 1998 and someone put this album on and it was great. I was on some E and hanging out in Brooklyn. I went into the city and hung out at a few parties. I will always remember that night. The music of Air plays a big part in this.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I agree with others that this is an extremely poor adaptation of a pretty good book. The best part of Crichton's novel was the explanation of time travel (or rather, parallel universe travel) -- which, while fanciful, was based on actual science. The movie completely alters and glosses over this part of the story. Then it further abandons the second most interesting part of the book (expositions on life in medieval France); also minimizes the third most interesting part (the character of Doniger, who must have been based on Bill Gates) and reduces the whole story to a corny action movie. The characters are poorly cast. Key plotlines are dropped. Overall, a major disappointment.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Honestly, I only liked 3 or 4 songs in this album; Smells Like Teen Spirit is the greatest Nirvana song that I've ever heard, You Know You're Right is also a very good song with repetitive lyrics which necessarily isn't a bad thing but it does get kind boring after hearing Kurt (lyrics) singing pain like 11 times. I also enjoy (but not really a favorite) listening to Rape Me and Lithium which are good additions to this album. But if you ask me, $13 for only a couple of good songs isn't worth it. I would rather recommend the album &quot;Nevermind&quot; from Nirvana.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This album is in the matter of opinions, if you like hole more poppy then this is the best album, if you like hole grungy, than this may not be the best choice. For hole's last album it, well isn't the best. It's sad that hole made lots of great music and bombed out at the end. I'm not saying that this album sucked, but i expected better. How can you blame them, Patty Schemel left the band shortly after the release and Melissa Auf der Maur left in 1999. Good album, the best tracks (in my opinion) are: Celebrity Skin,Awful,Malibu,Playing your Song, Dying and Petals. FYI: Did you know that there were 4 different titles in debate for this album? They were, Courtney Love suggested, Reasons To Be Beautiful, Eric Erlandson suggested, Sugar Coma, and Melissa Auf der Maur suggested Best Sunday Dress, but in the end they agreed on Celebrity Skin.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|I think you get what you expect when you purchase this album. It does not push the envelope of McLachlan's talent or ingenuity and is not a departure from the formula which has earned her millions of fans.  The lyrics, harmonies, instrumentation, tempo and style are all consistent with her prior work.  I really enjoy it and would strongly recommend it.<br />I do not think that this CD shows off McLachlan's voice as well as it could.  The clarity of her voice, astounding true pitch and very precise and deliberate enunciation of words are not as evident on this album as on other albums.  I am a McLachlan fan for one reason - her amazing voice.  This album gives her voice a more &quot;pop&quot; quality than I would prefer.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|It was said to be a great come back to the eighties. Well, let's see.<br />Wildest Dreams - a lame, souding between rock'n'roll and heavy metal, song. The music sucks, so do the lyrics. Back to the eighties? Yeah, if you mean the gay level of the music. 3/10<BR>Rainmaker - one of the best songs on the album. Short, real heavy sounding song. Should've replaced WD as the opener. Rocks, really. 9/10<BR>No More Lies. Quite good. A typical slow intro, and a predictable explosion at some part. Quite good on gigs. Almost beats TAatG in repetetivnes. 7/10<BR>Montsegur. Heavy. Good. But I've heard many better songs. Much better. And the chorus sounds lame as hell. 6/10<BR>Dance of Death. Oh my gods! The cheesiest Maiden song ever. Sounds like some gay scout song to sing by the fire. Quite heavy at moments though. 4/10<BR>New Frontier. First song written by Nicko. Hopefully the last. 2/10<BR>Gates of Tomorrow. A classic gay rocker from the eighties. 3/10<BR>Paschendale. The band tried to be great by writing a WW I epic. Well, they tried a bit too little. 5/10<BR>Face in the Sand. Oh yeah. Definitely the best song on the album. Heavy, great lyrics, great guitar work! 10/10<BR>Age of Innocence. Same thing as GoT. Sux. 3/10<BR>Journeyman. Quite good. A 100% acoustic song. I like it, though the electric version from the NML EP is much better. 7/10 (album version)<br />Whole album: 5/10. Sux.
B000002VMD|5.0|All of the six songs that Whitney Houston sang for &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; soundtrack show her as a true diva taking control!  Every time I hear &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, I get chills!  It is so perfectly done, so beautiful, and you can't be moving around, because Whitney's taking center stage and running the show when she sings it! The other songs are just as good, such as &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot;, &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot;, &quot;Run to You&quot; and her no-nonsense dance number &quot;Queen of the Night.&quot; <BR>The other album's half is okay, typical soundtrack stuff, but I love SOUL SYSTEM's rapped-sung &quot;Lovely Day&quot; and Lisa Stansfield's &quot;Someday I'm Coming Back.&quot; The Kenny G song and the theme from the Bodyguard are also good.  But the true album's standout is Whitney!  I can see now why it's sold over 24 million albums or so to date! A diva at her highest level!
B000003JBM|2.0|In principle guru's experimentation on jazzmatazz is a good thing.  The variety of guest artists adds diversity and originality to each track, and gives the cd a distinct jazz flavor.  However, there is one problem with the album: guru really isn't a very good lyricist.  His rhymes are boring, simple, and formulaic.  An example from &quot;take a look at yourself&quot;: &quot;In there gettin funky with the track/I used to drive a cadillac/it got me there and back.&quot;  As you can see, the lack of diversity in guru's delivery makes for a fairly bland album, despite its experimental nature and promising direction.
B000002VCQ|5.0|I didn't get to hear this album until over a year after its release in spring 1986.  It is a very fabulous album.  Some of the songs are a little sappy in the lyrics, but Whitney overcomes that with her superb voice and range on all of them. There are two songs on here, Someone For Me and Thinkin' About You (the two dance numbers) that give How Will I Know some stiff competition!  I have played those songs more than &quot;How&quot;. Loved the duets she did with Jermaine Jackson and Teddy Pendergrass. And she sounds superb on the remake of George Benson's &quot;The Greatest Love of All.&quot; I still think she sings a little too loud on &quot;All At Once&quot;, especially &quot;Though I must face it all alooooooooooone&quot; singing it too loud. I go &quot;Whitney! You sound too loud!&quot; every time those parts come up!  I still love &quot;You Give Good Love&quot;--that was the SONG! Whitney at her rawest form there!  Although she moved on to pop-oriented stuff and soundtrack hits like &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, this is such a unique debut, very R&amp;B. I think they waited a year too late to release the later singles--they sounded better in '85 than '86.  It still holds up today every time I hear one of that album's hits on the radio!  Timeless songs!!!!!! Heavily imitated by wannabe singers to this day on talent shows, American Idol and the like!
B00003CWL6|5.0|'American Beauty' might be the best movie coming out of the United States in the last ten years. Everything falls together in this great movie. The story is great; a man in his midlife crisis who quits his job, doesn't understand his daughter and reverts to puberistic behavior, but he loves it.<br />His wife is brilliantly played by Annette Benning. Especially foreigners who are living or lived in the United States will see the humor in her performance. She is so American that most American's will not see her little over-the-top acting which makes it great. And then of course Kevin Spacey who is great as Lester Burnham.<br />There are so many themes, so many characters. As he says in the end of the movie; they look normal from the outside but in fact they are not. And that's what this movie is about.<br />It might be a little strange to watch sometimes, or it can even make you ashamed of yourself but 'American Beauty' is one of the best movies in the subjects of midlife crisis, gayness, American society etc.
B00008S2VG|1.0|Oh my God...Madonna has hit rock bottom with this totally empty album. All its tracks are recycled songs that we have heard many times before. She lacks any originality with such drudgery as Nothing Fails and a laughably bad American Life- the title track. And she has the guts to rap, no less...My sides were in pain, from laughing so hard. You can differentiate one song from the other. Madonna sounds as monotone and tone deaf as ever- out of tune and out of sync. She has the misfortune of not being able to sing. At least her 80's music had some decent songs. This is plain sad, and Madonna needs to hang it up.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When ADTI (an amazing band as well) split up I had no idea something even better would come up. When I first listened to Sparta, I thought Oh man, not as good as ATDI. And when I first heard TMV, I was listening to Inertiatic and I said &quot;What The Hell?&quot; because Cedric's voice was so high and unlike is screaming voice with ADTI. So I listened and each time I became more and more fascinated and I still do. De-Loused is what music is.<br />1.Son Et Lumiere - 10/10 - A cool intro to the best song on the record.<BR>2. Inertiatic ESP  - 10/10 - An amazing song, amazing voice amazing sound. My favorite on the album.<BR>3. Roulette Dares - 9/10 - A very good and solid song.<BR>4. Tira Me A Las Aranas - What To Say, an intro track with funky guitars.<BR>5. Drunkship Of Lanterns - 10/10 - Another masterpiece, and right from the start it grabs you and it never lets go.<BR>6. Eriatarka - 9/10 - Great song with the best line on the album, &quot;If you only knew, the plans they had for us&quot;.<BR>7. Cicatriz ESP - 10/10 - An epic masterpiece. And for those people who hate the ambience, its a welcome change from mainstream.<BR>8. This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed - 8/10 - Worst song on the album, but still very good, which is amazing.<BR>9. Televators - 10/10 - Beautiful and haunting song that features Cedric's emotional singing at its best.<BR>10. Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt - 10/10 - Tied with Inertiatic for best song. Just insane. And the last 1:00 of the song, of the album is probably the best ending to the best album ever.<BR>All that simply put: BUY THIS ALBUM!

0790729628|5.0|By the time Roy Batty dies, he has made peace with his engineered fate, that his manufactured four-year lifespan was ending.  Upon relinguishing his life, Batty releases the dove he had been clutching, his soulful metaphor, which escapes into the gray sky.  The implication is that Batty's compassion for Deckard manifested his humanity, and thus earned him an afterlife.  It was a poetically masterful conclusion to a cinematic masterpiece of science fiction.  Most fans of science fiction will agree that this is one fine film, proof of what can be done with the genre when it's taken seriously, as something that can appeal to grownups.  About that, we can pretty much concur.  The contention begins when we discuss which version is better: The original theatrical release, or this Director's Cut.  Look at some of these other reviews and you'll see what I mean.<br /><br />The theatrical version is now out of print (it was on VHS).  I have it and I've seen it countless times.  I also have this Director's Cut DVD, and I've seen it countless times, too.  What some of the other reviewers have failed to mention, or have glossed over without explanation, is HOW the two versions differ.  First, the noir-like voice-over is omitted in the Director's Cut, as was Deckard's fly-away escape with Rachel, the final scene in the original.  Second, there is an added scene in which Deckard falls asleep at his piano and dreams of a unicorn running through a verdant wilderness.  Though they seem minor changes, these omissions and additions change the movie to the degree that the two versions are entirely different films.  In the original, Deckard's and Rachel's escape implies their living happily ever after.  In the Director's Cut, Deckard himself is a replicant, he and Rachel both doomed by the four-year lifespan.  To fans of the original film, the conclusion of the Director's Cut is hard to swallow.  I know: I was one of them, and when I first viewed the Director's Cut, I didn't even see what is now glaringly obvious.  Viewing the original edition so often had biased my perceptions; I simply couldn't see it in any way other than how I initially interpreted it.  But via discussions in the Blade Runner newsgroup I came to think and accept otherwise.  Deckard was a replicant.  The proof is distilled from three points: Deckard's dream of the unicorn; the memories implanted by the replicants' manufacturers into the minds of the replicants to give them a sense of an extended lifespan; and the final origami -- a unicorn -- discovered by Deckard as he and Rachel escape.  There are other clues, for sure, but these cinch it: Deckard's dream was known to someone besides himself, just as he had known Rachel's private memories in detail, because they orginally belonged to Tyrell's niece.  After a period of adjustment, I've come to prefer the Director's Cut.  It's a more nuanced film.  Also, this is truer to the director's vision, and that's a good thing in this case, like a mistake corrected.  It's less happy-ending Hollywood.  I haven't watched the original version since I bought this DVD.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it's a two-sided disc, with a widescreen presentation on one side and fullscreen on the other.  The image quality is superior to that of the VHS edition, of course.  The yearning soundtrack by Vangelis, so integrated into the whole experience, is enhanced by the digital rendering.  For DVD extras, there's not much here in the form of special features -- &#34;production notes&#34; the only real extra, stuff you read; not really that special -- but for now, this is the only available edition of this great film.  And it's more than enough, if you love films by directors with visionary ambition.<br /><br />On a hopeful note for those of you favoring the original theatrical release, I understand there's a special edition DVD package planned that'll include both versions of the film, both digitally corrected in a couple of spots -- those of us cult-like aficionados are painfully aware of some glaring continuity errors -- along with a few other goodies as extras (REAL extras, such as a director's commentary).  But there's no official release date as of yet.  For now, if you don't have the original release on VHS you're tough out of luck.  But having to settle for this Director's Cut isn't a bad deal: It's as close to the director's original vision as you'll get for now.ware of some glaring continuity errors -- along with a few other goodies as extras (REAL extras, such as a director's commentary).

B0001UL7RY|1.0|What does it say about today's youth, if so many kids are buying into this poor me screaming irrelevant noise?! There are so many more interesting rock bands out there. If everyone likes Avril, that's cool. I just hope the folks buying into this angrier-than-thou/feel-sorry-for-yourself-with-me posturing also consider looking into some other great rock groups from around the world, and of earlier years. Not everyone is feeling sorry and angry all the time. It's a mood that has it's place. But this is cheesy overkill. The music (sans singing) is actually not bad, though...Maybe it's just Avril. Maybe she just needs a shrink. Then she can get with some relevant lyrics that speak to a bigger world than the one inside her head.
1558216847|5.0|It is certainly a good idea to be skeptical about any historical account, and this one particularly invites such skepticism because of the lack of corroboration from the other persons involved.  However, I found that the entire story is very plausible.  The writing style is quite straight foward and humorless, but that is just the style this story calls for.  I think it is a fascinating book.  I have read it twice.  It would be instructive for anyone wishing to get a first hand account of the inhumanity of the totalitarian state.
B000099T2L|1.0|This girl must be commended for her dedication and persistence as an artist. She consistently tries to achieve high quality work. Although she demonstrates talent as a performer, a sound image, and mass appeal, since this review is about her cd, it is necessary to review her musical talent. Despite the obvious attention to detail on behalf of this singer, and production staff, I find most of her singing uninspiring and boring. She uses the same old licks and her voice is just not a big deal. Perhaps she has potential to contribute more to her music. Maybe this cd is dull because everyone involved was holding back on the creativity, for fear the commercial appeal might not follow more original music. Modern Hip Hop and r&amp;b was founded on a long and soulful tradition of varried singing styles and voices, inspired orchestration, and overall originality. This cd could have provided a refreshing and welcome addition to the genre. Frankly, it just doesn't deliver.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This is a phenomenal album!  If you don't like every song on it...something is VERY wrong with you (or maybe you like Rap!)!  This is TRULY one of the best albums I've ever heard!

You will NOT regret it!<br />To Renee....I hope you read this....We are going to REALLY enjoy watching you grow into the large star that you will surely become!

B00004TH7Z|4.0|If you like your heavy metal served with heaping spoonfuls of corn, this cd's for you. Iron Maiden is the epitome of the music that your parents loved to hate. (They probably thought that you were also worshiping the big bad.) The funny thing is that these guys are old enough to be your grandparents. Aging rockers are  back in style (see Van Halen, Slash and his new band, Velvet Revolver, Aerosmith, etc.) One thing that stands out about this album is what a great bunch of musicians these guys are. I've always loved Adrian Smith's guitar playing, and the return of Bruce Dickinson means the return of the pseudo-operatic, over-dramatic but always appropiate British Heavy Metal vocals. Now that all the guitarists are back, we're talking about three part harmonies and excessive solos. Woo-hoo! I find myself constantly singing these songs, especially &quot;Blood Brothers.&quot; Although I have no idea what the heck any of these lyrics mean, I have this CD in constant rotation on my iPod and CD player. Heavy Metal is back!!!!
B0002234LS|1.0|This was, by far, the worst film I saw in the theater last year. Just plain awful. Slow and ponderous, with Johnny Depp sleepwalking through his role even as Turturro chewed on the scenery in a performance that was unintentionally laughable. <br />They owe me the 20 bucks I wasted taking my date to this steaming pile of dung.
B00006CXXU|1.0|What is the point?! The only reason I am writing a review for this cd is because it was a gift that I hope nobody else finds it necessary to purchase for anyone else. Christina has strong lungs and a decent delivery. But, she needs to stop trying so hard. I mean, she's already successful. She already has fans. Why oversing?! She sounds silly on most of the tracks. Most of the songs would be suited for someone less accomplished who may give more attention to the appropriate placement of ornamentation. I imagine what she'd sound like singing a telephone book or the Bible. Everything she does is the same over dramatized shlock. This genre of music is very inspiring, and Christina has a lot to offer as a model and a performer. Maybe her singing would be more appealing if she added some fiber and roughage to her diet. She needs to calm down, experience more of life, and then, after some rest, go back to the music and tap into her feelings, not just her range of notes and all that missplaced belting!
B000002LCX|5.0|The CD shows the musical versatility of Morrisey and the way this band put together quality sound.  &quot;Girlfriend in Coma&quot; and<BR>&quot;Last Night I Dreamed Somebody Loved Me&quot; show the intense search for love..and gives one a sense of being lost in a cruel world. <BR>Reminds me of my 20's, when I was quite confused about life and what it meant.
0380778556|5.0|I finally had the time to finish reading this wonderful thriller! Daphne du Maurier's prose carries so many important details woven together that every paragraph must be savored. Her books are not ones to speed read. As with My Cousin Rachel, the title character is created out of the other characters recollections of her, her possessions and her history. Unlike Rachel, Rebecca's appearance doesn't allow for her to make any explanations or tell her version of the story. Both books end abbruptly but with Rebecca there's a chance for happiness for the protagonist.
B00004U8JU|5.0|When I originally saw this movie, it was at a movie theater with an excellent sound system.  Needless to say, I was somewhat disappointed when it came out on VHS a few years back.<BR>I have since bought this version of the DVD, and boy - what a difference!<BR>The DTS sound track will pick you up - toss you in the air then slam you down on the ground - and then youll ask for more.<BR>Clearly the way the move was mean to be seen / heard and FELT. <BR>If you have at least a decent home theater system, with good low frequency capabilities, then this movie is a must buy.  Why hear the T-Rex when you can feel it?<BR>As far as the picture quality - its as good as it gets for DVD.  No artifactts, discolorations or distortions at any point during the film.

B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie will divide fans.  In the comicbooks, the Hulk is considered a superhero (after 40 years of comicbook stories and countless writers, artists, and editors taking their spin on the character).  In this movie, for purposes of establishing his/its origin, the Hulk is a misunderstood monster on the lamb from the U.S military who want to destroy him (a very tired plot device in tv and movie sci-fi/adventure these days).  Director Ang Lee puts his spin on it as the Hulk's origin is tweaked a little. Part of the Hulk's transformation is due to repressed anger of Dr. Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) from of an abusive father, Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte).  Part of the Hulk's originally written origin (by Stan Lee) is kept intact (exposure to gamma ray radiation from a self-inflicted experiment), but the added &quot;abuse&quot; subject matter seems trite and unnecessary. When Dr.Bruce Banner is the Hulk, the film picks up and the cgi effects are seamless.  The best sequences are those when the Hulk is running away from the military in the desert, jumping over canyons and cliffs that are miles apart.  Otherwise, the rest of the film is not fun or very interesting.  It is downbeat and the characters are not very memorable. Many reviews state that Jennifer Connelly (as Betty Ross--Bruce's/Hulk's love interest)was playing the same character she did in A BEAUTIFUL MIND (Why not? It won her an Oscar!).Glenn Talbot (Josh Lucas) was a generic slimeball, as was Sam Elliott's &quot;obsessed with destroying the Hulk&quot; General Ross. Lastly, The love angle between Bruce and Betty wasn't interesting either.  There isn't anything new here (except for the abusive father thing). The old tv show with Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno (who makes a cameo in the film) did keep the &quot;monster-on-the-lamb&quot; concept through the course of the series.  It's main theme was like the tv show &quot;The Fugitive&quot;. Dr. Banner is on the road, going from town to town, city to city. He presumed a different identity every week trying to find a cure for his &quot;condition&quot;. There was pathos hovering over each of plot storylines.  Somehow, it worked for the purposes of the television series and it made for a pretty decent dramatic series.  However, it didn't work in this film.different identity every week trying to find a cure for his &quot;condition&quot;. There was pathos hovering over each of plot storylines.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|This disc is what it is....GREATEST HITS.  Of course some things are gonna be left of, but it's still a great album with great songs.  GNR beats anything on the radio today and this is a great cd to remind us of how great Axl was before he completely lost his mind.
0793509602|5.0|This is the BEST! I held off starting my studies due to the title of this book. Being a ROCK player, not true &quot;metal&quot;, I let the label steer me wrong. However, this book is FANTASTIC for ANYONE wanting to learn lead guitar in almost any genre. <br />Very well written, excellent examples. When you finish volume 1, you WILL be a lead player!<br />Thanks, Troy!
6304077955|5.0|I love this movie.  It contains one of the most blistering portrayals ever put on film.  David Thewlis as Johnny gives a magnificent performance and its the best reason for seeing this movie.  You can't be unmoved by him.<br />I'm sure after seeing Thewlis playing Professor Lupin in the third Harry Potter movie that a lot of people are wondering what else he's done.  <br />Why isn't this movie available on DVD?!
B000055WIQ|5.0|First of all i wont go into great detail about this movie as so many other reviewers have. what i will say is if you have not seen this movie see it. i was not born before it came out in 1973 so when it was re-released in 2000 i saw it in the theatres and i must say i like this version better. Take the scene where ellen burstyn is coming home from the doctor's and walks into her daughter's room. in the original there was no music. in the new version there is music that creeps up on you and i think makes the scene better not to mention the flashing demon faces. and the spiderwalk scene is very wild. i have seen this many times and it is one of my favorite horror movies. Linda Blair and Ellen Burtsyn both should have won academy awards for this. Watch this in the dark by yourself with the lights out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Just listen this album, ull like. I believe in her.<BR>She has broken her leg, she is a really working girl, dont talk bad if u didnt hear this record.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|A deeply moving and haunting movie about 4 people caught up in the world of drugs. I CANNOT BELIEVE they gave Julia Roberts the oscar over Ellen Burstyn, but thats the academy for you. This movie will stay in your mind for days. Ellen Burstyn and JEnnifer Connelly did an excellant job and the last half an hour will blow your mind. see this excellant movie. i cannot recommend this movie enough.
044022425X|4.0|i would have given it four and a half stars but you cant do that. i dont think it merits five stars but i wouldnt call it a four star book either. <BR>Diana Gabaldon begins to pull together all the floating strings in The Drums Of Autumn and she does an excelent job. She brings in a new romance, quite nicely, and has it play out much better then Jamie and Claire. it doesnt go rancid. She brings in a new charecter with Jamie's nephew Ian, who one gets to know in this book; she doesnt send Ian on the predictable route and instead creats quite a good charecter. She also brings in and developes Lord John Grey, who is a complex and interesting charecter. Again, the plot is good,  being complex and not all that predictable, her writing style, though not deep, is definately hooking and beleivable. The one thing that gets very old is Jamie and Claire. They were great in the first book, they actually argued and acted like two people in a relationship but in this book it's all cotton candy between the two of them. Diana Gabaldon creates a possible fantacey or hers, in the relationship between Jamie and Claire and it stops working. Every body gets older and well it does not mean that they  get any less beautiful it is doubtful that, unless she got implants, her boobies are as firm and round as they were when she was 27. I seriously doubt that her hair looks like Autumn and i find their relationship more and more sickening: no relationship is that perfect, it would get boring. <BR>on the whole though, it was a good book, possibly my favorite from the Outlander series.
B0000TSQXE|5.0|Even if you own In the Zone on CD, you must get the DVD-Audio version!  It is truly an amazing listening experience!  It's like being in the middle of the room while Britney sings and dances all around you. This is mixed in surround so it comes out SIX speakers!!!  And I can tell you, as a sound mixer myself, this is one of the best surround mixes I've ever heard.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|When Myazaki came to an arrangement to release Ghibli films through disney, he had strict guidelines for such release.  In exchange for exclusive rights to rerelease Studio Ghibli films, Disney agreed not to alter the films' content.  Thus, all Buena Vista rereleases of studio Ghibli films have been true to the originals.  <BR>Miyazaki's films have a far reaching social impact and often touch on topics of environmentalism and the human impact.  His mastery of making the viewer relate intimately is amazing.<BR>if you are a fan of any of his work (princess mononoke, Spirited away, etc.) then you will not be disapointed in this movie.  My faith in this statement is so strong that although the Buena vista release has not arrived, I am assured that it will be of the utmost quality.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I have a strong interest in artificial intelligence.  I am fascinated by the possibilities for humans and our future.  Japan has always embraced robots as benefactors of humankind, but American entertainment always portrays robots as sinister and a mistake.<br />A.I. puts the blame on the humans, who are abusing the &quot;mecha,&quot; humanized robots, that they have created.  Although the premise is worthy, A.I. leaches all hope out of the viewer and replaces it with utter bleakness.  The scene of the toy teddy bear lumbering after his abandoned robot boy master (Haley Joel Osment) in the dark forest is almost as unbearable as the endless scene of the same boy robot's open, staring eyes as he has been trapped at the bottom of the ocean for many years.  The scenes of innocent Mecha being systematically destroyed for human entertainment, including a gentle nanny robot, are a kind of robot Schindler's List.<br />The film is too long. Jude Law gives the best performance as a robot gigolo who befriends the boy.  The special effects are flawless, but in this case they just serve to make your depression more realistic.  A.I. fails in its mission to be thought-provoking, which is very unfortunate, because this could have been a masterpiece.
B000002URV|5.0|When I was driving down the highway in my big big truck,listening to this music,I was nearly fell asleep.I almost lost my life.Then an angel flew down on me and said something very very sweet to me.She said I am a voice of ENIGMA.The next moment I was in the sky flying over the clouds.I was deeply absorbed in the journey of my pure mind.I was so refreshed and finally found myself in a starnge room full of sexy angels waiting for me for a long long time.This music is a kind of drug that take you higher and higher to the next spiritual level.<BR>So passionate and alluring !!
B00005JMEW|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I had been previosly warned of its violence. But that did not take away from the film at all. A brilliant, oddball, epic masterpiece. Directed wonderfully By Tarantino. Full of well-choreagraphed action sequences that set it off. A work of genius. My only criticism is that it isn't long enough.
B000000OMB|5.0|Prog rock worriors got together to team up this project band.The main concept is &quot;LESS IS MORE&quot;.That is no more meaningless guitar solos or keyboard solos.This strategy turned out to be very successful in Japan.The songs are so compact and commercial enough to capture listeners heart.This is the JOHM WETTONS's album and moreover WETTON'S composership reals his brilliant craftsmanship and his strong vocal expressiveness.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Almost every song on this album (...). \\"Pay the man\\" is one of the best songs. It lasts for 8 minutes and yet it isn't boring, AT ALL. If you liked Smash, you'll love this. I even find this album better than Smash. It's just total pwnage!
0792162803|5.0|I'll admit, this movie is kinda bad. But it's one of those movies, that's really bad and stupid and just so ridiculous...that you love it (Like &quot;A Night at the Roxbury&quot;). I first saw this with my best friend at a sleepover when we were totally high on sugar, soda and ice-cream (the best time to watch this movie, by the way...), and it became an instant sleepover classic.<br />I suggest this movie for the slightly insane (I'm nuts and I'm proud)
B000001IPL|5.0|This is the best independent CD sold to date. And that says enough. If you like any of the other albums, you'll love this.
B0002DB50E|5.0|This film is finally getting the treatment it deserves, a double-disc Criterion edition.  It will be re-discovered and newly discovered by Cronenberg & Criterion fans alike.  <br />The soundtrack and the dialogue were always more disturbing to me than the imagery, which still shocks and creeps under your skin more than any CGI effect ever could.  It's the organic nature of Cronenberg's style that sets him apart from everyone, period.  <br />It's also his most prophetic work, a warning for how television can and has warped our sense of reality.<br />\\"The battle for the mind of North America will be fought in the video arena, the Videodrome.\\"
B00006RINF|3.0|Lacuna Coil's &quot;Comalies&quot; is one of those albums where you get your money's worth for the cd, but you didn't get a bargain.  They're not bad.  The guitar work is pretty good, the drumming, while fairly simple is still tight, the bass is fine, and the female lead vocalist is just awesome all together.  Now we have the matter of the male vocalist.  To be blunt, he sucks.  He can't sing at all, and that is with the help of studio work for his voice.  He likes to do that wispery voice sing that anyone can do.  Maybe its a good voice in Italy, but I don't see it.  I saw the Lacuna Coil performance for &quot;Heaven's a Lie&quot; live acoustic on headbanger's ball, and the male singer destroyed it.  Everytime the chorus hit, I couldn't help but laugh because he sounds so terrible.  Its not that hard to just match someone elses voice and make it sound listenable.  And she isn't singing in a high pitch on the chorus.  But he just sings the wrong key completly, it was horrible.<br />But still, everything else is good on the cd, and the studio work makes his voice almost listenable.  There is about 4 awesome songs on the cd, the rest are just descent.
B00000GUZP|5.0|Debbie, you should be very proud of this album/cd. It is an overlooked classic- it is so damn good it brings tears to my eyes. Thanks. (I've got the digitally remastered 2 bonus song Holland import, btw. WAY AHEAD of its time- EVEN NOW.
0688172377|5.0|It naturally just goes to your heart. The language is simple and honest, so you can read the book in a day or two. Her story was just remarkable and the book was well-written. People should be made aware of FGM and its effects. They should know that it exists. I particularly liked the way she ended the book. She says that if the existance of FGM has any meaningful explanation, maybe she would think twice about denouncing it...but this practice has no significant reason to exist what so ever! There were, however, too many \\"In Africa...\\" generalizations in the book. FGM is not ubiquitous in Africa, in fact, most Africans don't even know that it's there. It is just concentrated mainly in East African countries like Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Egypt, Djibouti, and some areas in West Africa like Mali for example. I loved the book. Everyone should read it!
B00004Y6OA|4.0|March 1980 saw Van Halen's release of their third album,WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST. The album title comes from a lyric to COULD THIS BE MAGIC?,track 8 on the CD.

0761536434|4.0|This book covers over 600 pages of entertainment history, starting at the beginning of the previous century up until the year 2001. It tells about the development of the entertainment business from the early novelty games and the development of the pinball machine, through the invention of the first computer and television games to the rise and fall (and rise again) of the coin-operated video game arcades which eventually lead to the development of game consoles and hand held computer games. Many of the well known and lesser known companies are present: Atari, CapCom, Sega, Nintendo, Namco, Activision, Electronic Arts, Coleco, Commodore, Mattel, Rare, etc.<br />The book reads as a novel and the story is told by the people who made video gaming history, through interviews held by the author. There are many anecdotes and quotes that really paint the picture of this colorful history, which will coincide with the history of many of this book's readers, making the book that more interesting to read. <br />There is a small section of 9 pages with black-and-white pictures showing some of the people who played a significant role in video gaming history. Also there are enticing pictures of a &quot;centipede&quot; assembly hall and a storage facility full of &quot;donkey kong&quot; games; cabinets that are now very hard to find in good condition.<br />Less glamourous but certainly part of history are the chapters about court cases and congressional investigations into violence, and the reactions of the game mannufacturing community. <br />Towards the end the book is more about the business than the actual games, listing the numbers consoles sold and the amount of money earned by some of the leading companies. This gets boring and while offering insight into the relative successes, it does not hold much historic value.<br />American and Japanese readers will probably not notice, but Europe is hardly mentioned in this book, leaving readers from this part of the world feeling underappreciated. While Europe played an important part in video gaming history, especially when America's video game business was failing, almost of none of this information is contained in this book. Even events, like the following, that played a major role aren't even hinted at:<br />&quot;By 1980, Magnavox had become a subsidiary of North American Philips (NAP), a Dutch electronics conglomerate. As a result, Philips released the European equivalent of the Odyssey² (the Videopac G7000) under its own company name. The Phillips Videopac G7000 was more successful than its American counterpart. There were many different versions of the system around the world, and one version (the G7200) even had a built-in monitor.<br />&quot;The G7000 inspired a larger following and enjoyed a longer life span in Europe than the Odyssey² ever had in the U.S. As a result, more games were created for the European market. If anything, the console enjoyed an even greater following when it was released in Brazil, where it was called simply the Odyssey. Brazil was treated to practically the entire release library of both the U.S. and Europe, and received a couple of exclusive titles (Clay Pigeon! and Comando Noturno!) as well.<br />(quote from [...] 2004)<br />The lack of complete information is compensated by a strong focus on Atari and Nintendo. Although these companies obviously played an important part in the history of computer games, it appears to be a slightly skewed representation of the entire playing field. <br />Apart from that I give the book a big thumbs up for detailing a very important part of history and being so well written.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|David Lee Roth,Michael Anthony and brothers Alex and Eddie Van Halen began their band as Mammoth in the early or mid-70's. I don't know what inspired the name change,but several years later they became Van Halen. This album was originally released in 1978,on Warner Bros. Burbank label,which features a view of Sunset Boulevard(the last year Warner Bros. albums,even past ones bore the Burbank label). Hits from the album include Ray Davies' YOU REALLY GOT ME,first recorded by Davies' band,The Kinks. RUNNING WITH THE DEVIL was a hit also. JAMIE'S CRYIN' is pretty cool. YOU REALLY GOT ME was heard in the 1997 Paramount film,PRIVATE PARTS. Guitarist Eddie and drummer Alex both can play both instruments. But during recording sessions,Eddie stuck with his guitar and Alex stuck with his drums. Anthony is the bassist and Roth is the lead vocalist. Roth's fellow members sing background on most songs they recorded. Seven years after this album was released,Roth was fired from the band and experienced persistent success with a solo career.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I loved Morris' &quot;The Thin Blue Line,&quot; so I was expecting something good.  This, however, is without question a stunning documentary!  I do not know how Morris managed to get McNamara to be so frank about what McNamara tacitly admits are &quot;war crimes&quot; -- committed by the United States, but we are all the wiser for it.  The movie uses a lot of Morris' techniques and a score by Phillip Glass, so it will be familiar on that level.  However, the power lies in an apparent spontaneity in McNamara's as he gives his views.  He simply opens himself up and says stuff that will blow you away.  I was mesmerized.  Highly recommend it, especially given our current predicament in Iraq.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|The spring of 1981 saw the release of Van Halen's fourth million-selling album FAIR WARNING. The album title is spoken by frontman David Lee Roth on the first track,MEAN STREET. UNCHAINED is the only Top 20 hit from this album. SUNDAY AFTERNOON IN THE PARK is instrumental. Other great tunes include PUSH COMES TO SHOVE,SO THIS IS LOVE and SINNER'S SWING.

0684857219|5.0|This book is not the final word on every subject mentioned within.  That said, it is an EXCELLENT book, and many people reviewing this book must not have read it.  To suggest that bodybuilders have &quot;proportionately weak legs&quot; must have missed the entire legs chapter of the book.  The current Mr. Olympia Ronnie Coleman can squat 855 pounds, and the world record is ~1100, so I'd say he's doing pretty well!<br />Some of the people dismiss the book because of the training routines, but I would question the diligence of their training.  If you are a beginner, and you use his advanced training routine for preparing for a world-class bodybuilding competition, IT WON'T WORK!  However, if you eat the way the book describes and train in accordance with your level of expertise, you can see fabulous results.  I gained 45 pounds of muscle in a year and a half following principles like Arnold's without using a single performance-enhancing supplement - let alone something illegal.  Genetics isn't what will hold you back - your desire to succeed will.
B000089RVX|3.0|I have to admit, when I heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; for the first time, I hated it. First thing I thought was &quot;Oh great, a female Linkin Park&quot; and wrote it off as the mainstream selling &quot;rap core&quot; in another new way. But my girlfriend let me hear the rest of the CD and I was mildly impressed. Then my girlfriend handed me some of Evanescence's older material. I was shocked.. why? Well..<br />Amy Lee does have a great voice, I don't think anyone can deny that, but it does seem like she's wasting her talent in alot of ways. For instance, &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; was a horrible single because of the &quot;rapper&quot; they invited onto the track. The original version of the song is only Amy and has better music including a great guitar solo. If you ask me, the label's choice to put a &quot;rapper&quot; on the Fallen version of the song was a mistake. For one, it mislead people into thinking Evanescence is a &quot;rap core&quot; group which could ruin how they see the band after hearing the whole album. Second, they ruined a perfectly good song that actually does have much replay value. And third, it turned off people who are sick of &quot;rap core&quot; music, forever leaving the group misjudged. &quot;My Immortal&quot; is a great track and by all means should have been the first single. The emotion in Lee's voice is powerful and suits the piano laced track and the aura it creates perfectly. This track does display TALENT and great song writing. If released as a first single, most people would have been happy to hear something different on the radio that virtually everyone can relate to (All the nu-metal garbage followed up by an artistic piano-laced song would've had more than a few people appreciative) and Amy herself would have gotten respected fully for her beautiful voice and lyrics.<br />&quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; is another good song and would have made a very decent second single. Some of the best music on the album is displayedhere. &quot;Going Under&quot; would be another strong point if it didn't get old really quick. All the people I know who have the CD agree that after a few listens, this song gets boring and is only good to listen to on occasion. &quot;Whisper&quot; the last track is unfortunately the last really strong track, leaving all the tracks before hand other than the ones noted sounding ok, medicore or just downright bad.<br />It's sad that the mainstream had to put Evanescence out there sounding like every other band on the radio. I seriously think it turned off alot of people who if not for the ridiculous &quot;Rap core song&quot; might have appreciated the band and might have given them more of a chance other than the songs on the radio. Because older songs like &quot;Where Will You Go?&quot; are beautiful. That particular song has some of the deepst, emotional, beautiful lyrics ever with some of the most haunting music as it's back drop. Amy hits high notes on that track so amazingly that you'd swear she's Maynard James Keenan's long lost sister. &quot;Field Of Innocence&quot; is equally beautiful and is a far cry from what Evanescence has become. Their three previous non-commercial releases &quot;Sound Asleep&quot;, &quot;Evanescence&quot; and &quot;Origin&quot; are great albums and should be downloaded by anyone interested in giving the band a second chance.<br />I hope they get back to their roots on the next LP and experiment a little more with other styles of music, something that made &quot;Fallen&quot; (Aside from My Immortal) highly repetitive and mediocre. What a shame for a band that was once really great who had the misfortune of getting noteriety not for that, but for an extremely weak album. Skip this and download the previous albums, since they're all out of print and unavailable to buy.<br />One love,<BR>Kevin
0452282152|4.0|When I saw the movie I thought, &quot;Wow, this really looks like a Dutch Renaissance painting in every frame!&quot;  However, when I read the book I felt like I was walking through such a painting  on every page; which was even more awesome.<br />I like the way Chevalier looks at and writes about art and color. When the colors of Griet's vegetables fought in the opening of the novel I knew this was a writer with an artist's eye.  And who better to write about Vermeer than an author who appeciates the play of light with color, the influence of history and culture on painting, and the elevated role of women in painting while they were degraded in society.  This was a highly visual novel that was fun to read.  Chevalier's style is easy yet intelligent.<br />As usual the book is better than the movie--read it.
B00005N919|1.0|This isn't an intelligent film, even for American standards. The police are so dumb they couldn't find a giraffe in a field of wildebeasts. Even the US army would be able to find the killer in this movie.<br />Having said that, this movie did make me quite hot. I walked down to the well and jumped in.<br />Here in Africa most people don't wear clothes anyway so nudity alone isn't enough to satisfy me.
B000002BFL|5.0|When 'The Rising' came out I went back and bought all of Springsteen's past collection. I came across 'The Ghost Of Tom Joad' and sat down to listen to it, not really knowing what is was about. It really blew me away, and for the first time I actually felt like I was pulled in to the album, thanks to Bruce's brilliant song writing. You listen to an album like this, which is so beautifully crafted, and then listen to basically any song from pop bands, you will be put into a new light. This is how music is suposed to sound, intimate, fun, and emotional. I can honestly say, if you buy this record you won't be sorry.

I walked down to the well and jumped in.<br />Here in Africa most people don't wear clothes anyway so nudity alone isn't enough to satisfy me.
B000069HKH|4.0|The reason I say this is only great for young fans is because it's a typical rock and roll record that you can play in the car and sing along to. The likes of which we rarely see these days. But if youre an old fan and you were excited about The Boss bringing out new material (finally) then you could be disappointed by a couple of tracks. Y'see there isn't any room on an eagerly awaited album for 'filler tracks' yet 'The Rising' does have 'em. The title track is the strongest one on there and other favourites of mine are 'The Fuse' and 'Waiting On A Sunny Day.' You should buy it anyway, simply because I wouldn't be surprised if this isn't Springsteen's final record. He has the talent but just doesn't push himself. Sorry Bruce.

This and much more in this combination high-tech/cyberpunk with far-reaching galactic sci-fi make this as intriguing and entertaining a work as &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. A definite must-read.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I don't get all you people out there that say you won't buy the Star Wars trilogy on DVD because it doesn't contain the original versions, only the special editions. So, for a few minutes in each movie that you don't like you'll give up:<BR>-Better picture<BR>-Better audio and,<BR>-A format that will not deteriorate<br />If I stayed away from every movie that had a few minutes I didn't like, I wouldn't own any movies. Saying you wont buy the movie at all because a few scenes have changed is the stupidest argument I have heard. And waiting until the originals are available is even worse...THEY WILL NEVER BE AVAILABLE. Give it up. Put up or shut up. I think we're all sick of listening to all the whining. I'd prefer the originals myself, but I'd rather have the special eds on DVD than not at all...

B000089RVX|1.0|The drummer for this band, Rocky Gray...is an incredible guitarist and used to play in Living Sacrifice and Soul Embraced. The song &quot;My Tourniquet&quot; was written and originally performed by Soul Embraced. <br />As for Evanescence as a whole, I think it's pretty freaking cheap for a band to forsake what it stands for and buy into mediocrity.
0156907399|5.0|This book is not for people who need lots of explicit flash-bang style action. Or for people who think they want deep concepts, but only if they are clearly spelled out so that the reader doesn't have to work to hard. There is no sex, but there is pleanty of romance, there is no killing, but there is death (on many levels). It is a book that deals with the inner workings of the mind and Virgina Woolf gives us a glimpse into some thoughts that come from people who are honest. Perhaps the best example of this is when Mrs. Ramsey, one of the main characters, struggles inwardly with her motivations and asks herself honestly why she helps people. She comes the remarkable conclusion that she helps people so that others will look at her and think about what a wonderful person she is. That may not seem so profound, but very few of us are able to be that honest with ourselves.<br />It is difficult to get through, so if you want a candy book go read Tom Clancy. Her points are subtle but honest. She says more about human nature in her 200 pages than any other author I've read. I wouldn't classify myself as an intellectual, but this is still one of my all time favorite books.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I had never watched the TV series on Tuesday nights, but bought the DVDs as a gift for my partner. Over the past two weeks we watched all 21 hours and for someone who rarely watches more than two hours of TV a week, that's really saying something. <br />The show is extremely well-written with sundry movie, tv, music, theater and historical references included as part of the every day banter. This is not your usual TV script and reminds me of Tracy-Hepburn movies. And the Gilmore Girls cast is excellent throughout!<br />I don't usually buy TV shows on DVD since you can almost always find them in syndication, but my partner and I can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD. Unfortunately, I'm forbidden to watch any of the current season until we catch up!<br />This is a can't miss opportunity for intelligent TV viewing pleasure!
0446310786|5.0|What I love so much about this book is that Harper Lee presents it as a story you might hear your grandmother tell. She accomplishes this with such skillfull and poetic use of language, powerful character development, and the right blend of sadness and joy to satisfy the reader in the end. <br />The title itself shows Lee's skill with words. The comparison of more than one character in the book to a mockingbird is touching. This is made poignant when you read Atticus' explanation of the title phrase and the echo of it by his daughter, &quot;Scout&quot;, at the end of the book. Ms. Lee powerfully draws the line of good and evil with her vivid descriptions of the characters in Maycomb. And, just like life, there is not a purely sugary sweet happy ending. However, the ending is richly satisfying and moving.<br />I was never assigned to read this book in high school or college, but I am so glad that I got around to it. Incidentally, the movie is just as good, with an excellent (oscar-winning, I believe) screenplay adaptation.

0618526412|1.0|First of all, I would like to praise Carson McCullers for writing that such poise and character exposition but she labeled Deaf characters wrong. As a deaf invividual, I am a culturally and literally novel reader and a teacher of Deaf studies at a community college. I want to clear about real Deaf people in the United States and their perspectives. First, I want to present myths about deafness and its facts. Here is a lisdt of the following myths and facts below:<br />Myth#1: Deaf people are sucidial. They tend to be lonely and uncommunicative among the majority of hearing people.<BR>Fact: A very tiny percent of Deaf people are sucidial. They are basically happy human beings. Many of my friends have decent lives along with good jobs, houses, and even cars. In 1950's, there was the very same situations in which we live in today. They do usually communciate with hearing people by writing on pads, speeching, using thru interpreters, and gesturing. <br />Myth#2: Deaf people are slow learners because they can't hear nor speak well.<BR>Fact: There's no significent co-relation on intelligence  between the hearing people and the deaf counterparts. Most of Deaf people can read and write in despite of any hearing loss and muteness. Again, there is a small minority of deaf people who have mental health histories or emotional disturbances. They do everything except hearing.<br />Myth#3: All deaf people can lipread.<BR>Fact: Not all deaf people can do it well. They can only master lipreading skills up to 30% of all words they can detect. The most skilled lipreader can detect up to 70%. Therefore, lipreading is not a very good communication strategy. The best way to communicate is to write on pads or using a certified interpreter. <br />Myth#4: Many deaf people are somewhat lonesome or isolated because they don't like hearing people.<BR>Fact: Most deaf people seek for another deaf people in big cities or towns that contain residential schools for the deaf. They can be lonely if you don't let them go what they want. It considers an act of oppression if you keep them at bay from interacting with other deaf people. They do like hearing people as long as they respect their independence and well-being. You can make friends if you are willing to learn sign language. They would appreciate if you show your efforts to talk with them. If they feel somewhat lonely, they would move to the communities where many deaf people work and live without question. I don't know why that such deaf characters decided to stay in that town and let it happened to them. <br />Myth#5: Deaf people seek for your mercy or help.<BR>Fact: Again, the majority of Deaf people don't ask for your mercy or help. They are proud and fierce independents. They don't usually beg for money. Peddling is unacceptable today but in the past, they had good reasons to do that because they hardly find decent jobs everywhere. How can they support themselves if you don't offer them? During 1950's, they usually were skilled workers. They did printing newspapers, assembly lines, and driving deliveries. They earned decent wages and salaries, too. <br />Overally, I want to make a clear and simple emphasis to you that not all Deaf people are lonely, unintelligent, uncommunicative, poor, or emotional. So I consider that novel is still invalid and stereotypical. I recommend that you should read other reading materials about Deaf culture and its history and arts which represent more positive and bright sides instead of that rubbish unrealistic novel. <br />Carson, who is in a Heavenly place, I want to let you know that I do appreciate your writing style with good insights about other people in the South but you should have to study deaf people more carefully before starting writing. Sorry, Carson. Hugs.
078062999X|4.0|&quot;Hamlet&quot; is obviously the gold standard for actors -- pull off the melancholy Dane, and you've just about reached the top of your craft.  Kenneth Branagh's turn as everyone's favorite soliloquist is an ambitious, bold, wonderful film that just misses the mark.  <br />First, the high points (and there are many).  By daring to film the entire (four hour!) production, Branagh has paid both Shakespeare and his audience the ultimate compliment.  As Branagh's characters spelled out in his comic gem, &quot;A Midwinter's Tale,&quot; cutting &quot;Hamlet&quot; from its full four-hour length to a two-plus hour length is one of the most difficult editorial processes you'll ever try, but everyone does it because nobody stays in their seats for four hours anymore.  By telling the &quot;whole story,&quot; Branagh fleshes out minor characters and provides more context for the story (for example, Claudius has a more precarious political position than many truncated versions depict, and his negotiations with Laertes become more important).<br />Branagh's Hamlet is a bright, dynamic individual, full of rage and yet stymied by his ability to see more than one side of the situation.  (As has been pointed out by wiser folks than I, if Hamlet and Othello were transposed, there wouldn't be any plays!  Othello would have murdered Claudius in the first act, and Hamlet would have seen through Iago's plotting and outsmarted him.)  He's a product of his home, which is a surprisingly well-lit, semi-modern location -- most productions cast Elsinore as a fairly gloomy place.<br />Showing off a buffness that was not present in his earlier films (in &quot;Henry V,&quot; Branagh is comparatively doughy), Branagh nails the part.  From his sheepish realization that he is overcoaching the players to his anguish over his realized inaction to his manipulation of Ophelia (a suitably tortured Kate Winslet), Branagh hits all the right notes and even pulls off the difficult fencing scene with Laertes.  The rest of the British cast (Branagh veterans for the most part, including Derek Jacobi as Claudius -- Jacobi was considered the leading &quot;Hamlet&quot; of his era) is excellent.  Watch for a nice Ghost scene -- the Ghost's fury and torment and Hamlet's horrified recognition that the Ghost is confirming his worst fears more than makes up for some second-rate special effects.  <br />The look of the film is tremendous.  Shot in 70mm (giving a richer, wider picture), &quot;Hamlet&quot; gives us a sprawling Elsinore Castle filled with a wonderfully dressed royalty.  The centerpiece of Elsinore is an ingenious throne room filled with mirrors, conveniently allowing for spying under plausible circumstances for key scenes.  But other scenes also appropriately take place in back rooms and on the edges of the domain.  This is definitely a kingdom worth killing for (as is Gertrude, played by the perpetually ravishing Julie Christie).<br />&quot;Hamlet&quot; forces the director to make choices.  Branagh has chosen to make Hamlet confrontational -- many of his lines that could be whispered asides to the audience are instead full-fledged roars to all and sundry.  Some might quibble -- it worked for me.<br />There are only two weaknesses in the film.  First, is the general weakness of the American cast.  It's a sad fact that not every great actor is a great Shakespearean actor, and in an apparent attempt to make &quot;Hamlet&quot; more accessible by bringing in well-known Americans, some jarring results occur.  Jack Lemmon, God bless him, sounds completely out of his depth in his cameo. Robin Williams, who has the acting chops to play Shakespeare, inexplicably makes his brief role as Osric as mincing as one of his stand-up comic homosexuality riffs.  Billy Crystal acquits himself fairly well as the First Gravedigger by showing the restraint Williams eschews.  The only American who triumphs in a cameo performance is Charlton Heston, who inhabits the role of the Player Kingwith a nice balance of pomposity and humility.<br />By comparison, the Brits who have minor roles (including Sir John Gielgud as Priam, Sir Richard Attenborough as the English Ambassador, and Rufus Sewell as Fortinbras) show how the Shakespearean game is played, even in small roles. <br />The only other problem I had with the film is Hamlet's exit -- the Christ imagery was just too darn over the top.  We're several decades removed from such obvious imagery (it may have worked for Paul Newman in &quot;The Left Handed Gun,&quot; but now it provokes only rolling eyeballs).<br />&quot;Hamlet&quot; is truly a magnificent attempt to tell Shakespeare's most famous tale.  Standing ovations to Branagh and friends for even attempting this unabridged version -- this was truly daring.  I have not seen a better film adaptation of &quot;Hamlet.&quot;  The fact that it doesn't quite work to 5-star level (unlike, say, Ian McKellen's &quot;Richard III&quot;) is no criticism whatsoever.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Stephen King's first novel that was adapted into film version is quite true to the author's words.  While Stephen King was less than pleased with the film version of his malevolent masterpiece, \\"The Shining\\", King was quite happy with Brian De Palma's direction and his vision with \\"Carrie\\".<br />Sissy Spacek in her debut role as the freakish, shy and telekinetic Carrie White. Sissy beat out Melanie Griffith and Carrie Fisher for the title role that launched her career.<br />The beautiful Piper Laurie is cast as the ravenous religious fanatic, stark-raving, bible beating, madwoman and Carrie's mother, Margaret White who chastises Carrie relentlessly and has a penchant for locking her daughter in the closet with a really creepy, crucified Jesus statue and candles so that Carrie may repent of her evil, sinful and womanly ways.<br />Amy Irving as the well-to-do town doctor's daughter Sue Snell and Amy's real-life mom, Priscilla Pointer as the \\"cocktails at five socialite\\", Mrs. Snell.<br />William Katt plays Tommy Ross who asks Carrie to The Bates High School Senior Prom, the butch, Betty Buckley as the ultimate in P.E. teachers from Hell, Miss Collins, Nancy Allen , Brian De Palma's wife as the horribly cruel and self-absorbed, Chris Hargensen, John Travolta as the boy from the wrong side of the tracks, Billy Nolan and  P.J.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|I have to admit that at first I did not like Slipnut.  Infact I couldn't stand listening to their first album more than 1 song because if I did I would get a horrible headache.  As for Iowa, I only liked 1 song off that album aswell My Plague.  But as for Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) I can't get enough of the CD.<br />First off, Corey Taylor has matured as a singer, it isnt just screaming all the time (except for Wait and Bleed off first album)  and yes I did think Stone Sour was a waste of good talent.  Second, #s 1-8 have all gotten better at what they do, especially Joey Jordison his beats are so much better.  <br />Slipnut's new album has me in a craze, because I'm acctually starting to like their old albums better knowing now that their first album was poorly produced doesn't help the sound of the album, and Iowa, well..do I have to say it?  Also, Slipnut looks and is a lot more fun to see live in concert now.  I think they all enjoy it a little better because they've had a real success under their belt.  I would highly reccommend this album to people who are open minded or people that just want very good music, or a nice scream.<br />Slipnut is the only screaming band I can really listen to and enjoy and understand what their screaming/singing about.  Now, about Stone Sour.  Why Corey?  Why waste your time pretending you where goin softer when you needed to focus on your main band Slipnut?  I personally think if they'd focused more Vol. 3: (The Subliminial Verses) would be even better than it is.  Slipknot is truthfully much better and if they keep it up their gonna have more fans than any other rock bands out there.<br />Now all that's left for me to say to Slipnut..When's Vol. 17 not comin out?
B0001Z37HM|5.0|I was raised on Conan and Red Sonja, so I can't help but highly recommend these movies.  No, the acting isn't great, and there are homosexual connotations that I just didn't catch when I was six, but these movies have stood the test of time-- at least in my estimation.  Wonderful adventures with unforgetable characters, and the swords are just darn cool.
B00005BJ9W|1.0|please stay far away from this cheesy new wave 80's pop album from these defunct musicians who are irrelevant as nobody listens to them anymore.songs like hungry like the wolf and lonely in your nightmare sound very dated and overall this album has aged badly.avoid at all costs.get any cd from bachman turner overdrive instead.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Last week I rented \\"the first fifty dates\\", and after watching it, I checked the previews that were on this DVD. One of the previews was of \\"Seinfeld\\" series on DVD!!!!

Very catchy tune<BR>Opium of the People - 9/10 Great song, but kind of a strange opening to the song.  Kinda sounded like System of a Down, but the rest of the song is crazy<BR>Circle - 9/10 one of two acoustic songs on the album, its mixed the vocals with the guitars very well, and it has a cool drum outro to it<BR>Welcome - 9.5/10 a heavy song with a cool solo<BR>Vermilion - a semi-heavy/soft song, a build up to vermilion pt.2 with a cool solo<BR>Pulse of the Maggots - 10/10 a super heavy song with some crazy guitar shreading, and from what i have interpreted a nice dedication to the fans of Slipknot<BR>Before I Forget - 10/10 a deadly song, with good vocals from Corey, and a somewhat slow bridge that sounds un-slipknot like but a cool sound<BR>Vermilion Pt.2 10/10 a nicely balanced acoustic song, and really different for Slipknot but a nice job well done<BR>The Nameless - 9/10 creepy song, nice vocals, unique samples<BR> The Virus of Life - 8/10 a creepy song, with lots of subliminal messages (the song I would replace with the song &quot;Scream&quot;)<BR>Danger-Keep Away 8/10 a good song that is very slow.<br />Overall a great CD by Slipknot, go buy it cuz its worth the money.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This is one movie I had to see over and over again as I brought family and friends to experience it. Ashton and the rest of the cast were phenominal! The story line kept the viewer intrigued. It evoked so many different emotions to watch the \\"effects\\" of trying to change one's past. Awesome movie. Needs to win a Golden Globe at least!!!
B00025ETIW|2.0|Another band to totally popimify their 2nd release in the SAME month...(the other being alexisonfire). \\"I brought you my bullets...\\" was catchy but this?! Come on! This is just TOO radiocore. Looks like they only had enough in 'em for one. I hope they make lots and lots of money.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is, without any doubt, some of the best music I have ever heard. It is a quantum leap above any of the music produced by bands in this genre; even such brilliant one's as Godspeed You! Black Emperor &amp; Mogwai.<br />Colplay have cited Sigur Ros as a big influence and you can hear it. Though, as much as I love Colplay's music, comparing Sigur Ros, and especially this album with them, is like comparing The Beatles with a Cellular Phone ringtone.<br />This sounds like they've tapped in to a vien of music that no-one else has access to. Their only difficulty will be producing music at this level consistently. If they can, now they're signed to a major label, they will be massive.<br />If ever there was an essential album produced in the last five years, this is it.
B00020HEG6|5.0|The music of John Williams is magical! I think this one is even better than the film music for the previous two Potter flicks. The chorus 'double trouble' is simply wonderful, even though it does not appear in the novel. <br />A 5-star recording!
B000000OUE|4.0|It had been a while (like 4 years or so...) since I'd listened to this album, and I don't know what was wrong with me.  This is a great, timeless, completely heavy album.  The whole thing is better than what came before (La Sexorcisto) and better than what came after (Rob's first solo album).  Overall, that would put this at the pinnacle of the Zombie legacy.  Every song is great in its own way, and on this disc White Zombie stradles that very fine line of giving each song its own sound without making the listener wonder if they're listening to a compilation; that is to say, every song has its own unique nuances but the whole thing is signature White Zombie.  \\"More Human Than Human\\" was the monster (haha!) hit, but any of these songs deserves repeat listens.  Go out and get this one if you have a hankerin' for some heavy, dirty, vicious-sounding metal.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This trilogy is the hallmark for all 'blockbusters' that came after it.  It set a format that is still being emulated in tone and in theme today, yet it's the original, and still resonates with audiences, despite its vocal critics.  Can't wait to see it in high definition.
B000003CKH|5.0|Cake's &quot;Fashion Nugget&quot; is a great, laid-back rock record with a unique sound, clever lyrics, and a talented singer.  This is the ideal soundtrack for kicking back on the porch with a cold beer on a Saturday afternoon.
B0001US62I|5.0|a wonderful little piece of film noir that will be right at home in any horror or suspense fans library. well done alan parker
B00006CXSS|5.0|Let's rewrite history for your benefit!<br />What would you suggest?<br />I suppose &quot;Patton&quot; is more realistic?<br />Some people need to get a life.
B000068TPN|5.0|This is a very moving film that depicts the first major engagement between American soldiers and North Vietnamese soldiers in 1965. The imagery of the battle is very, very well done, but the movie isn't just about guys shooting at each other. It also shows how things were at home, how the soldiers' wives dealt with their own challenges. Best of all, We Were Soldiers isn't a Hollywood creation; with a few unimportant exceptions, it stays true to the actual events recorded in the book &quot;We Were Soldiers Once... and Young&quot;. If you're looking to learn a bit about the Vietnam War (and have some fun at the same time), this is a great DVD to buy.

It's just a little screaming with Black Thought rapping. Sounds horrible, and is probably the worst LP song ever.<BR>H! Vltg3: 2/5<BR>LP didn't really change this song at all. The rap is just stronger.<BR>[Riff-Raff]: N/A<BR>Just another message for Mike.<BR>Wth&gt;You: 4/5<BR>It's a tie bewteen the original and remix. They made the song stronger, but Aceyalone's rapping was terrible.<BR>Ntr\Mssion: N/A<BR>Just a little piano.<BR>Ppr:Kut: 5/5<BR>I think the remix is better than the original. The whole song has a great sound.<BR>Rnw@y: 3/5<BR>The original was better. The chorus is OK, but the verses and the Backyard Bangers aren't OK.<BR>My&lt;Dsmbr: 5/5<BR>Much better than the original. The rock is stronger, and Kelli Ali sounds great. <BR>[Stef]: N/A<BR>Yet another message.<BR>By_Myslf: 5/5<BR>Wow, LP really improved this song. The new chorus sounds fantastic, and the verses are better.<BR>Kyur4 Th Ich: 4/5<BR>Sounds a lot better than the original. The techno sounds great,but it's too short.<BR>1Stp Klosr: 5/5<BR>Who thought LP could possibly improve such a great song? They made it longer, and Jonathan Davis sounds awesome. The ending part where LP and Davis sing is the best part of the song.<BR>Krwlng: 5/5<BR>Another great song. Aaron Lewis really makes the song sound cool.<BR>The above reviews for each song is why i give this CD a 4/5. The first songs aren't that good, but the last ones are great, making up for the horrible ones.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|A lazier artist would have merely taken all of his unreleased material and issued them under the disguise of &quot;new albums.&quot; But not Bruce Springsteen, the man who proved you can get rich and famous paying homage to the working class citizens while keeping your dignity and that working-class ethic in tact. As if the 4-CD unreleased/rarity-packed &quot;Tracks&quot; wasn't enough, The Boss (as he is called) released other unreleased songs on the box set's predecessor &quot;Greatest Hits,&quot; and three more on the &quot;Tracks&quot; sampler &quot;18 Tracks.&quot; And now, an entire disc of odds and ends highlight this expanded best-of collection. So why didn't he just release those songs as different albums under different titles and say &quot;Well there's my new album&quot;? Because Springsteen loves to work, and loves to make music. He released three studio albums in the 90s, and the whole time he had a vault full of unreleased, already recorded material, but decided to release new albums instead.<br />Some complain that Springsteen has no right to sing about the working class while he lives the life of a successful musician; but by that logic, B.B. King, the late Ray Charles, Muddy Waters, and every other successful blues musician should have put away their guitars and stopped making music the second they became famous. After all, there's no more reason to sing the blues right? Wrong. Like so many others, Springsteen actually knows his subject--he wasn't born with his picture on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, now was he?<br />&quot;Essential&quot; is one of the few compilations that actually lives up to its name. True, fans can argue back and forth about what tracks should have been included and which ones should have been left out. One could say &quot;'Adam Raised A Cain' instead of 'The Promised Land,'&quot; or &quot;More material from &quot;The River,&quot; &quot;Nebraska,&quot; and &quot;The Ghost of Tom Joad&quot;!&quot; It could be endless, but the thirty tracks on the first two discs do a pretty good job at simply defining what each era of Springsteen's career sounded like. It starts with his naive beginnings when his heavy-rhyming lyrics reflected Bob Dylan, then to his confidence as a spokesman for the downtrodden and on disc two, an anthem-maker and commentator on the bleaker aspects of love. Three of the best songs from 2002's wildly successful and highly praised &quot;The Rising&quot; are included, and nicely ended with live performances of two anthems that would come to fit perfectly in the post-September 11th American attitude; the awkwardly dark '41 Shots' and the slightly more optimistic 'Land of Hope and Dreams.'<br />The third disc meanwhile is worth the price of admission alone, a collection of 12 rarities, unreleased songs, and some soundtrack work. The best cuts are the &quot;Nebraska&quot;-raw 'The Big Payback,' an anthemic live version of Jimmy Cliff's 'Trapped,' the heart-wrenching falsetto performance on 'Lift Me Up,' and 'County Fair,' a simple, beautiful song about a simple, beautiful day.the thirty tracks on the first two discs do a pretty good job at simply defining what each era of Springsteen's career sounded like.

0064400018|5.0|I read these as a youngster and I am re-reading them after a trip near Independence, Kansas where we saw a house where Laura's family once setteld. They are great books! I am seeing the whole experience from a new perspective now that I am 35 (relating more with Ma I think) and I am enjoying the stories completely. It's also nice because the books can be read in a single afternoon or just a few hours. A wonderful look at the pioneer life with details about cheese making, maple suger harvests, and cabin building (in the later novels). I highly recommend these books but suggest reading them in order to keep the story of Laura's adventures straight.
158799190X|5.0|Taleb is the ideal independent (if IRREVERENT) thinker who deliver the news few want to hear (see the amusing prevalence of obsessive detractors). <BR>His point is simple:<BR>1) He uses logical thought experiments to show that in a random environment Warren Buffets are almost unavoidable to produce JUST BY LUCK --of course misunderstood that Warren Buffet has been lucky (the subtelty is not difficult to get).<BR>2) If you have done poorly in life he can convince you that it may not be your fault (therapy)<BR>3) If you have done very well in life and do not introspect you will be angry at him (he takes away from you your self-importance). The explanation are the attribution &amp;overconfidence heuristics: people are motivated by a lack of understanding of the odds. They believe that their successes were explainavble &amp; their failures were random. Go tell a gambler that he does not have the odds: he will be angry at you.<br />All that is wrapped in his idiosyncratic style. I have to say that I find his both charming and extemely arrogant. There is a deep philosophical point but it is too difficult for this. <BR>HE did not tame his arrogance for this second edition
0446530891|4.0|The book puts the reader in the middle of the action within the first 20 pages. Two similar events, 8 years apart, involving both a Secret Service agent, apparently unconnected, quickly come together into a single story with many characters, events, surprises, in this past paced thriller. Overall a well structured story, keeps you reading, and you better do or you'll forget some of the pieces of the puzzle. I enjoyed it. Only minor point: the author includes sometimes too many &quot;thoughts&quot; of possible theories/plots that tend to confuse.
B000002X4T|3.0|I must admit, even as a Jefferson Airplane fan, that Volunteers is probably the weakest of their albums.  It sounds pedantic and moralizing, kind of Rage Against the Machine-esque, in a sense.  It is also very difficult to separate the music from its context, which makes the album seem dated and irrelevant.<br />In a way, I think that Jefferson Airplane's Volunteers illustrates, very well the dangers of writing politically topical music.  After time runs its course, matters which were of extreme political and social importance, are often no longer so.  As a document, indicative of the political and social climate of the late 60's Volunteers functions quite well, but as a work of art, it suffers.
B000002MJC|5.0|If you look at Depeche Mode's history it's clear that if they did not sign with Mute back in about 1980....they wouldn't have been able to do half the things they have done creatively.  a lot of bands, like the cure or radiohead and nine inch nails even....have a lot of creative control that many major label bands don't have. it jus kinda get's me that as experimental Depeche was with SOFAD, you would think fans would understand the inspiration and focus of the work.  I think a lot of fans knock off this album cuz it's not Violator or Ultra or Black Celebration.  This is just not a synth dominant album, which is what everyone expected this to be...but it's not.  I do agree that some of the songs are not THAT good (you know exactly which one's i'm talking about) but please don't knock off this album cuz it's not all drum machines ran on a tape deck and 3 synths playing.  That's what makes DM a great band...they're willingness to put out a very different album...and still reach #1 on the US and UK charts...and still have a very long, and AMAZING successful tour, is astouding.    I say listen to this album a few times, very openly.  Leave it alone...listen to it again OPENLY, and see what happens. IMHO  this album in it's own right is amazing although you can't say this is classic DM.  The album is heavily influenced by blues, gospel, soul, and rock with the obvious electronics.  All the tracks are really solid, but i'm agreeing with Alan Wilder himself by saying that \\"Get Right With Me\\" is difficult because it kinda leaves the feeling that it's not finished ya konw?  btw ok Condemnation is not THAT bad.  Dave Gahan does sound out of tune sometimes but it's a very emotional song if you jus listen.
B000002KHB|4.0|As boring as classic rock can be, sometimes it can be great, like this. This is the most famous Purple album, as it should be. It's pretty basic metal (for it's time). &quot;Lazy&quot;,&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot;,&quot;Highway Star&quot;, and the fantastic &quot;Space Truckin'&quot; are the radio hits, and they are the best songs on here, but the others like &quot;Maybe I'm a Leo&quot; are all in exactly the same style. If you like what you've heard, you'll like the ones you've never heard of too. It's commercial as hell, but kinda dark too.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Another masterpiece by Marillion,very beatiful songs,very beatiful lyrics,very great.<BR>it's wrong to say that this album is beatiful since Brave,marillion's album are all beatiful.Listen it this strange engine,stupend for example.<BR>Carry on Marillion
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This cd is just flat out a pure master piece in ever sense of the word. Now dont get me wrong by the title of my review Many people didnt like Iowa what so ever, I myself did but yes it did fall well below my expectations. But as an abid SlipKnot fan, maggot whatever you wanna call me I knew after making an album that alot of people didnt seem to like very well I knew Volume 3 was gonna be explosive and more in depth. Volume 3 is like I said just flat out great on all aspects. Even the slower more mellow songs are not only a new twist but a great turn to the album also in my opinion. I have yet to see SlipKnot live but after listening to the Live Pledge Of Alligence tour cd with such GREAT bands such as Mudvayne (THE BEST BAND) but they have some other great music just like SlipKnot, System Of A Down and so on. But also actually seein what they bring to the stage on the Diasterpieces DVD is nothing short of phenominal!... Dont let Iowa be the reason you dont run out to get Volume 3 because Vol. 3 just blows Iowa outta the water!!!<br />Run out and get this masterpiece you wont be disapointed!!!
B00005N5S5|5.0|James Cameron's films have humanity, maybe even more humanity than most Spielberg films do today. But, this is a genre piece that ends up, defining or re-defining the genre of action-adventure. As far as I'm concerned, James Cameron created the first here in The Terminator and some of the very best non-stop roller-coaster ride action films. <br />This is the Snow White of modern action. The granddaddy of action movies today. What Frankenstein and Dracula were for horror film sooo long ago, The Terminator was and is for action.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I think that everyone should give this album a chance...I like every single song on this C.D, which says a lot because I'm super picky and there is almost always that one song on all my C.D's that I just detest.  Not so on this album; give it a listen and enjoy!<BR>P.S.  Gotta love the reviewers who insist that certain artists are idiots and if you like them and their music, you must be an idiot too...I just wanted to say thanks, because yes, according to you I must be an idiot...and I'm DAMN proud of it!! :)
B000060P79|2.0|Simple Plan is extremely poppy, predictable, talentless, generic, brainless, and whiny, but somehow they still rock. Honestly, I cannot figure out what it is about &quot;God Must Hate Me&quot; that makes me like it so much. I think 80% of the people bashing them just aren't open enough and think hating SP will be good for their image. Whatever, you can do that but your missing out on some good music.
B0001IN07Q|2.0|Well, having felt I judged this a bit harshly I have re-edited my initial review.  I first saw Michael Buble on 'Totally Blonde' (just out on video in Japan...we are THAT behind!) and was so impressed that I went out and had a look for his CD in the hope of finding something that would recapture what I saw in him on the screen. There were 2: This one and his debut album, 'Michael Buble', and I unfortunately chose the former.<BR>Although I love this genre of music, always have done, I was SO disappointed with, well, mostly the DVD.  Although he rates 5 STARS for sheer talent, I had to be mean and strike him down to 3, just purely because I felt that he was let down by whoever decided to make that kind of bizarre DVD!  <BR>The following are comments I would like to make to fellow purchasers:<br />1) The CD was ok, but I felt that it would have been better if it was an &quot;either/or&quot;: Either a concert CD or a studio recording. <BR>2) Although I am still only 27, I do appreciate being kind to my eyes.  The worst part about this album was the DVD.  The camera shooting moves around SO much, and the audio is so off with the picture that its like a badly dubbed movie that you just can't keep up with...the best part is the end 3 bonus tracks that are shot in the studio.<BR>3) Buy the debut album instead, and hopefully we can be patient enough to wait for his next CD that will not only contain the additional tracks of CFWM, but also some new stuff!  His voice is to die for, and sends shivers down my spine just listening to it.<br />Finally, with so much potential inside him, so much passion for the music, will he ever pen his own songs? It's all very well re-releasing the great classics, but to really bring this music to the 21st Century and keep the music alive, you need to make it apply to people now, give it a new edge. People will always tend to prefer the originals, and he runs the risk of disappearing into the background...and we don't want that!!!!  Bring on something new, as well as the old, otherwise, it will always be 'of that era', for people to reminiss on, not relate to.<BR>Just a thought.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Hands down...best CD ever. <BR>Or my favorite anyway.<BR>Need I say more?
1572814748|5.0|I pre-ordered this MONTHS ago, and it arrived today! It comes in a nifty little dark blue box, with artwork from the deck of course. This box is much better than standard, where the top comes completely off: less wear on that one card that ends up at the back of the deck, plus it just looks nicer. The backs are a little different: dark blue sky with blue clouds and a single yellow star in the middle. The colors are much more vivid than the newer version of the standard-sized Univeral Waite (um, maybe USGames should look into that, as it's obviously a printing issue). Of course the size is very nice for us small-handed Tarot-holics! Well done version.
0312263120|4.0|Ok- first off... I really did enjoy this book. However, now that I have all 4 of Brown's novels, I have noticed a certain formula that Dan Brown uses.<br /><br />1- Use the word \\"Incredulous\\" as often as possible (although he kept the word to a minimum in \\"Digital Fortress\\" less than 10 occurrences).<br />2- The bad guy MUST be known by a term/phrase instead of a name (here he is known as \\"North Dakota\\").<br />3- The bad guy is double crossing the good guys... and you are NOT supposed to suspect this.<br /><br />4- The novel must take place in the course of one day.<br />5- Your hero must wake-up and not have a clue that he will spend his entire day many miles away from home, while being chased by bad guys.<br />6- All good guys must be experts at something very arcane.<br />7- The ending must be weak.<br /><br />If you follow these steps you too can write a Dan Brown novel. ORRRR you can use this formula to figure out the book you are currently reading after about 100 pages.<br /><br />  Of course, tweaks the formula for each of his books. However, \\"Digital Fortress\\" is clearly the little brother of all Brown's books.  The plot is interesting and while the it certainly is a \\"Page Turner\\" you notice pretty quickly that everything doesn't quite add up. Like when the deaf guy notices all of the people entering the street because he HEARS a bell being rung.<br /><br />  As others have pointed out, Brown has taken quite a few liberties with computer programming. Even though it took me two tries to get through FORTRAN, I had very little trouble figuring out a few of the mistakes.<br /><br />  For the most part I enjoyed the novel. Since I know the Brown \\"Formula\\" it didn't take me very long to predict EXACTLY what would happen... but hey, sometimes a little predictability is ok!
B00005AQGH|5.0|This is classic 2pac, his best album in my opinion.  This album is probably his hardest album.  All the songs are solid and there is not one weak song here.  But my favorites are Me And My Girlfriend (instant classic, jay-z tried to do a remake but failed), Life Of An Outlaw (just love this song its great), To Live &amp; Die In LA (we've all heard this classic), and the rest are good too.  To cap off a classic album, this remastered version includes the video of &quot;To Live And Die In LA&quot;, which is a good video too.  If you don't have this album, well you are missing out big.  If you are a 2pac fan, it is mandatory that you have this album because its his best.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Yes, you've seen it a hundred times on TV...but not at home on dvd.  Watching the killer rabbit scene in slow motion is worth the price of the set alone!  This is one of the greatest comedy films ever.   You owe it to yourself and  family to add \\"The Grail\\" to the home dvd  collection.    So add to cart  and prepare to laugh out loud for the 101st, 102nd, 103rd time etc, etc.  Don't let a few measely $$$$ stand in your way!
B0002858YS|5.0|I have been wainting for a LONG time to find a new band that took what I love from my favorite bands (New Order, The Cure, The Jesus and Mary Chain)and translate it to the 21 century. The wait is over. At last there is a new band that I can relate to musically as a proud child of the 80's (the best and worst decade for modern music)!! The Killers rule.
B000089RVX|5.0|This cd rocks. Amy Lee has such an amazing voice. All the songs are great on this album. &quot;My Immortal&quot; is the best song on the album. it is an awesome song and you can feel the emotion coming out of Amy Lee's voice as she is singing the song. If you dont like rock music, this cd is still one that every person should have in their collection. The lyrics can really move you. You rock Amy Lee
B00006SFBD|5.0|This is the second weakest opeth album in my point of view. this album doesnt have alot of acoustic and heavy metal mixed songs but still some of these power up the album.<BR>1) Wreath 11/10-incredible. one of the best heavy songs they have done with nice beat and really good melodies.<BR>2) Deliverance 9/10-heres one of the songs that is not strong enough for opeth. it has some boring passages and way too simple beats for such a creative band.<BR>3)  A Fair Judgement  10/10- an awesome soft song. unfortunately it is a little bit too long for a soft song. and it might bore some people in the end but maybe not. its different for everyone. an excellent song.<BR>4) For abscent Friends 11/10- a pretty touching instrumental. it carries the emotions very well. dazzles me a lot.<BR>5) Master's Apprentices 7/10 - i did not expect to hear such a song from opeth. the music is a pretty low qality. mikael can definetely do much better than that and the album would have went perfectly fine without it. a pretty boring osng in the beginning where mikael repeats kind of the same thing over and over. bores me a bit in the beginning.<BR>6) By The pain I see In Others 11/10- outstanding. incredible instrumentational parts. this song made me think much more of the album. it is a great finishing song. leaves an incredible impression.
6304806434|3.0|For pure adrenalin and testosterone exposure, one can't do much better than CON-AIR. There are a ton of unbelievable action scenes, and that's the key word---unbelievable.  One can't say director Simon West didn't keep the action flowing.  The finale in Las Vegas is way over the top!!!<br />Credit the actors for doing something with their roles, especially the brilliant John Cusack who puts his teeth into his meaty role as a US Marshall.  Also Colm Meaney as the DEA agent who is obstinate and overbearing, to say the least.  There are a nasty set of villains--John Malkovich, Nick Chindlin, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, David Chappelle---a nice looking guard played by Rachel Ticotin, another good bad guy played by Mykel Williamson, and Monica Potter does a nice turn as Poe's wife.  Nicolas Cage is so bland, saddled with a ridiculous Southern accent, and does so many stupid things, it's hard to see how we can consider this guy that heroic.<br />But, if you want a two hour roller coaster ride with plenty of guns and action, CONAIR is hard to beat.  It also has the Trisha Yearwood version of &quot;How Do I Live,&quot; which is worth watching the movie!!!!
8186939024|5.0|&quot;It's my belief that if you cut into a thing deeply enough, if your incisions are precise and persistent and conducted methodically, then you may reveal not only that thing's inner workings, but also the meaning behind those workings.&quot;  Alan Moore<br />I am at the point of being convinced that if Patricia Cornwell can spend over a million dollars and not be able to conclusively prove the real identity of Jack the Ripper, that nobody is going to ever be able to do it.  But since we will never know the &quot;truth&quot; about Jack (Ripperologists cannot even agree on who gets to be counted as his victims, which is a pretty important starting point for construction any sort of theory as to whodunnit) all that really matters is whether someone can construct a compelling case.  In that regard, &quot;From Hell: Being a Melodrama in Sixteen Parts&quot; by writer Alan Moore and artist Eddie Campbell, certainly succeeds.<br />Volume One contains the &quot;Prologue: The Old Men on the Shore,&quot; set in Bournemouth in September 1923 in which an elderly Inspector Abberline and alleged psychic Robert Lees reminisce about the past, including the Ripper case.  &quot;Chapter One: The Affections of Young Mr. S&quot; tells of the supposed marriage between the incognito Prince Eddy and Annie Crook, the sweetshop girl.  This relationship becomes the motivation for what follows.  &quot;Chapter Two: A State of Darkness&quot;  introduces us to William Withey Gull, who would grow up to become a doctor, a Mason, Queen Victoria's Royal Physician in Extraordinary, and, in Moore's story, Jack the Ripper.  In this story a stroke suffered by Gull in October 1887 becomes another catalyst for this rather amazing transformation.<br />In the Appendix to each chapter Moore careful details his sources, alterations and inventions for &quot;From Hell&quot; on a page-by-page basis. While such elaborations will only serve to infuriate most Ripperologists, they are certainly of interest to us poor neophytes who cannot help but be fascinated by the details of the unsolvable mystery. Moore is working primarily off of Stephen Knight's &quot;Jack the Riper: The Final Solution,&quot; which advances what Casebook: Jack the Ripper (the world's largest on-line public repository of Ripper-related information) labels the most controversial Ripper theory. Known as the Royal Conspiracy theory, it does have the delicious quality of involving virtually every person who has ever been a Ripper suspect. Despite its popularity, Ripperologists pretty much universally dismiss the theory: it is currently ranked 6th on their list of suspects while Cornwell's choice, Walter Sickert, is 12th out of 22.  But then the most popular suspect is still James Maybrick, brought into prominence by the &quot;Diary of Jack the Ripper&quot; hoax (ah, but was it really?).<br />All of this just reinforces the idea that &quot;From Hell&quot; is not history, but rather drama. Time and time again, it is the rationale of the STORY rather than the FACTS that drive Moore's narrative.  The artwork by Eddie Campbell is certainly evocative of the tale. I even think there is a point at which the reader has to be grateful that the bloodier episodes are rendered in stark black and white drawings. Campbell presents various styles at different times in the narrative, altering it to match the narrative. But it is Moore's epic story that captivates throughout as he puts his giant jigsaw puzzle together from all the evidence and his own speculations.  Final warning: If your introduction to &quot;From Hell&quot; was the movie by the Hughes Brothers, then you are really ill prepared for what happens in this graphic novel.

B0000027RL|5.0|This is the best album to come out of the grunge era sure nirvana's nevermind was probably more popular but it didnt sound as amazing as this cd did. It starts out with once a great rockin intro to start the journey. Next comes the classic even flow which everyone has heard eddies vocals are top notch on this song. After that comes the best song on the cd and of the whole grunge period, alive. Wow wut an amazing song. It has deep personal lyrics and the best damn guitar solo ive heard since led zeppelins stairway to heaven. After that comes another great rocker why go and then the deep and emotional black, probably the best ballad they have ever done. Then comes the second best song on the cd, the classic jeremy about a young boy who commited suicide in front of this classmates. Then comes in the tranquility of oceans which is a great slow tempo song. Porches is another hard rock fast tempo song with an awesome guitar solo. Garden is next, which also features another great guitar solo, damn i love these solos!! Deep is a great song that captures eddies amazing vocals on here. And finally we come to ballad number two release which is a great way to end the cd. Well there u have it. The greatest cd to come out of the grunge period and possibly of the 90s. I recommend this for any hard rock fan period young or old.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This album is fantastic. It marks another long leap forward since the collossal WTF of &quot;Outside&quot;. &quot;Earthling&quot; proved Bowie could pull off electronica (albeit Bowie style). &quot;Hours...&quot; displayed a gradual shift back to traditional Bowie (it sounds like Bowie asking fans if they want more Beatmeister or Rock God); organic guitars and vocals set over drum loops that, while they got to feeling artificial, were certainly quality songwriting. &quot;Heathen&quot; dove right into the real &quot;band&quot; feel, and &quot;Reality&quot; is the continuation of that movement, all organic instrumentation and inspired songwriting. The real standout is the funked up jazz dream &quot;Bring Me the Disco King&quot;, a seven minute masterpiece that gives us a piano, a snare, and Bowie, crooning in that weird Bowie way about everything and nothing all at once, so eloquently, so beautifully.
B000002KBU|1.0|this album might fly when the hippy flag was not yet torn to complete shreds and everyone was feeling a little blue but i'm sorry joni i just don't care about you and your songs are self-indulgent in a way that just makes me feel annoyed and further from christlove that even Prince Myshkin could ever imagine.  When joni is blue i don't want to come in your kitchen. . .  period.
B000089RVX|3.0|Let me start by saying I would actually give this CD 3 in a half stars. Evanescence is 1 of the only rock bands I like. @ 1st I thought they were just going 2 B another hard rock band, but they're actually really good. They have some techno type sounds in like 1 or 2 of their songs. Let me make this quick.       &amp;quot;Going under&amp;quot; Great song!      &amp;quot;Bring me to life&amp;quot; Also a great song!      I'm not sure if this is the 3rd song because I don't own this album, but my step brother does and I've listened 2 the whole thing B 4.      &amp;quot;My Immortal&amp;quot; Great ballad! It's not what U would expect from a rock band especially since they're not alternative rock, but who cares!      The rest of the song sound alike, but &amp;quot;Everyone's fool&amp;quot; stands out a bit. I would definately recommend this album even if you're not a rcok fan (like myself) Let it grow on U. I don't like today's rock. If it helps those of U who aren't really into rock, some of my favorite artists R Usher, Sean Paul, Beyonc'e, Aaliyah, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Missy Elliott, and Mary J. Blige and Alicia Keys. And I even like Evanescence! So just give them a chance.
B000002LUB|5.0|I remember when this Black Sabbath come back album came out in 1992 or so.  Ronnie James Dio was back at the helm and a very cool music video for \\"T.V. Crimes\\" (with a junky, obsolete television playing nothing but Sabbath is constantly being stolen) was playing on MTV's Headbanger's Ball.  I liked the single, but only later did I purchase Dehumanizer.  I was stunned at how solid this album is.  It is right up there with Heaven and Hell and Mob Rules.  In fact, I like it better than Mob Rules.  The first track \\"Computer God\\" just rocks!  The vocals are awesome (as they usually are for Dio, but especially on this track).  \\"T.V. Crimes\\" is a fast-paced rocker.  \\"After all (The Dead)\\" and \\"Letters from Earth\\" are dark and haunting.  \\"Sins of the Father\\" is a track I think Ozzy would have sounded great on as it sounds like his style.  \\"Too Late\\" is one of my favorites.  It is a very powerful song, quiet at the beginning and then launches into a blistering metal track with killer lyrics: \\"It's too late too late for tears, too late and no one hears you, welcome to forever, it's too late.\\"  \\"Time Machine\\" is the most mainstream of the tracks with two versions on this album (one from Wayne's World which I cannot tell apart from the original).  The anthem here, though, is \\"I.\\"  It is amazing musically and lyrically: \\"I am virgin, I'm a whore, Giving nothing the taker the maker of war, I'll smash your face in, but with a smile.\\"   There is nothing weak on this album.  It rocks from beginning to end.  If you are missing this album in your Black Sabbath/Dio collection, Buy It!  You will not be disappointed.
B00003CX95|5.0|The best guy's movie ever?  It's hard to say.  Some things are so subjective it's tough to make any determination.  I personally just bought it on DVD and watched it for a third time last night.  Loyalty, honor, virtue, desire, love, and the experience of platonic friendship as being an end in itself; these values are the embodiment of what makes us men.  I'm very glad it was made.  It may well not be the greatest movie ever but there can't be too many that rate higher.  It's incredibly entertaining and the ending foreshadows what Gibson (and his ICON Films) eventually did with &quot;The Passion.&quot;  A must see.
0790729652|3.0|Here is why I gave this DVD a 3.  I love Batman to death.  I still remember being 6 years old and going to the theater to watch it.  And plus I can honestly quote the whole entire movie, I've seen it that many times.  It's one of the best films ever.  However, like most of the reviews, the DVD features suck.  I was disappointed that there were no extras.  However, I can still watch the DVD at anytime.  That is why I give it a 3.  Oh yea, I'm Batman.
B00018D44U|5.0|I am surprised to see that, though this album has remained a strong seller for months after its release, so many people seem to have written reviews of it merely to vent spleen about how awful it is.  Some of them are outraged jazz fans.  Others are disaffected worshippers of Norah's first album, Come Away With Me.  Personal taste cannot be accounted for, but I think a lot of people are facing this music in the wrong way.<br />First of all, Feels Like Home is very different from what I usually listen to.  If I'm not listening to a deep and intellectual piece of classical music, I'll probably play Tom Waits, Leonard Cohen, maybe Radiohead -- all of which feature male voices and pessimistic, intricate lyrics.  Yet somehow, I'm still able to appreciate Norah Jones, probably because her music serves as such a contrast to my usual fare.  This disc especially, since it is absolutely one of the most cheerful albums out there.  Most popular music either dwells on rage over lost love or rage over the system, whatever that may be.  In this context, what can be wrong with a sunny, almost inocuous album?<br />Second, this is anything but elevator music or background noise.  Norah Jones has one of the best voices of any young artist I can think of; pretty but not bland, with just a bit of a smokey edge and sensual whisper.  The instrumentation, which manages to blend Norah's jazz piano with more folk-oriented guitars, always strikes me as original.  Furthermore, despite continual attempts to disparage this music by pidgeonholeing it in a certain genre, it cheerfully resists classification from beginning to end.  I detect jazz (though less than in the first album), quite a bit of grassroots American folk, and just a dash of Nashville.  And I can't name any other artist with a combination like that.<br />More than anything else, I respect Norah for following her own path and managing to rise to popularity anyway.  I usually steer clear of what the majority of Americans read, watch, and listen to -- and many reviewers have accused Feels Like Home of being pre-packaged and commercial.  But I think this misses the point entirely.  Miss Jones once said in an interview that she never knew the pop mainstream very well until she became it.  I think she's right: her music bears little relation to any CD which has sold so well within the past decade or more.  It has no glitzy production, no hip electronica, none of the innuendo that appeals to the teen crowd, and is accompanied by no dance moves, bared navels, or 48-hour marriage scandals.  Nevertheless, it just keeps outselling all the pop acts that attract our national attention.  And Norah has done this just by being her quiet, unassuming, lovely, and utterly charming self.  This is an impressive achievement at any time, most of all in today's society.  I think, if anything, this music is more essential now than ever.  It is simple, unclassifiable, and above all cheerful -- and has become a success almost in spite of itself.  Highly recommended.
0743455967|5.0|Half autobiography, half writing advice, On Writing will give you amazing insight into why Stephen King writes the way he does. The first half of the book is spent almost exclusively in an autobiographical tale about King's younger life, up until his first published book, Carrie. The second half is all English teacher - he breaks down the what, why and how's of being an author. Don't think for a second that one part is more interesting or helpful than the other - they fit together very well and you really get to understand how a top selling author thinks. Highly recommended. I bought a copy, loaned it out and never got it back...so I bought a second copy!
6302862949|4.0|Baryshnikov does eleven pirouettes straight.  What more can you ask for?  Anyway, the movie was very good.  It was a dark, communist Soviet Union film, with a lot of tension.  But most importantly, Gregory Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov were fantastic.  It is superhuman what they can do.
B0002234LS|4.0|This film did disappoint me in some ways, but astounded and shocked me in other ways.  For those of you who have read the novella, you will know what I am talking about.  I'm not sure if this was a mistake or not, but in the film, the story that Mort Rainey( Depp) has written and published is Secret Window, and the story that John Shooter( Turturro) claims HE has written is Sowing Season.  In the book however, it is the exact opposite!  I would think the script writers would pay more attention to such an important detail.  Then again, maybe it isn't as important....
6305603847|5.0|This movie is awesome! I just watched it today because school's over and I was bored. I was spellbound the whole time. Contrary to other reviews, there is a plot, but it is very confusing and hard to follow due to the fact that it isn't in chronological order among other things. It certainly isn't a popcorn movie; you actually have to pay attention to enjoy it.<br />But, nevertheless, it is a superb video. I myself am not even a big fan of Pink Floyd music; but I was entranced by this film. But, be warned, the film is very depressing, shocking, violent, and graphic at times; especially the animations. Although they obviously aren't real, some of them are very creepy.<br />I'm 16, and although I could handle it, it was quite disturbing in parts. I wouldn't recommend anyone under that age watching it.

B00005JM0B|3.0|T1 was amazing the I first watched it in the 80s and still it is one of best ever Sci-fi movies. Since then I've seen it 10+ times and I can't stop admiring it and enjoying it...<br />T2 was out of this world...rarely a sequel can top the original...and T2 did just that to T1...amazing action and special effects but what made T2 a blockbuster movie in my opinion is that it had a solid story, drama and character development with great plot and acting...a true sci-fi masterpiece...<br />T3...well what can I tell you about it except that we've waited for this sequel a long long time more than a decade to follow up on T2...Basically T3 will stand ashamed of itself next to T1 &amp; T2...The whole production seemed rushed, the whole movie seemed without direction. The story could have been much much better. The choice of actors/actresses was wrong (apart from Arnold of course and the women terminator, they were both good)...The story would have been better if Sarah Conner was kept in the story as an alive character in that case Linda Hamilton should still have taken that role...Sarah's son role should still have been done by the same actor who did T2, not only he is actually and really the same person we knew from T2 but his age would have been perfect for T3...I didn't feel the actress doing the role of Sarah Conner son's girlfriend/wife/assisstant was a good choice, she was weak and didn't fit the whole feeling of an action scifi movie of the calibre of Terminator...she wasn't special and did more harm than good to the movie...<br />T3 would have been some movie to be proud to have watched and own if James Cameron had directed it...his talent, touches of genuise, his clear and pure understanding of the Terminator saga would have made this T3 a great if not an awesome addition to the first two...Saddly T3 wasn't to be more than an enjoyable movie to watch...no more no less
6305265666|4.0|At first when I saw they were making this movie I was intrigued, but also skeptical, about this new twist on Perrault's Cinderella, this time starring Drew Barrymore.  Well, Cinderella is my second favourite fairy tale, so I should probably force myself to sit through it for that reason alone.  Barrymore's also not that bad of an actress, not the best, but hey not the worst. Then I notice Anjelica Huston is in it also, and hey I really like her so why not go and see it?<br />Well eventually I completely forgot about the movie, never did get around to seeing it in theatres.  Then while surfing through the channels on my TV I see a commercial for the movie being shown on some station and I'm intrigued all over again.  So I tune in to see the movie, and wow, I was not expecting this movie to be as great as it was.<br />This is not Disney's version of Cinderella, not by a long shot, so if that's what you're looking for in your tale of Cinderella I suggest you search elsewhere.  Instead of the pixie dust and fairy tails you get the legend of Cinderella, the supposedly true story which the fairy tales were later based off of.  The movie opens with the brothers Grimm arriving at a castle in France invited there by an again woman who wishes to tell them the true story of Cinderella without the magical pumpkins or a faery godmother.  I'll spare you all the details of the film which every other reviewer has already gone through.  I will however tell you that the performance is average from Drew Barrymore, no fireworks with her acting here, just the way she usually is, which isn't that bad but she's not going to be winning an Oscar anytime soon I promise you that.  Anjelica Huston was amazing and easily stole the movie away from Barrymore, she was simply delicious as an Evil Stepmother, the role fit her like a glove.  Perhaps my favourite role in the film was of Pierre le Pieu played by Richard O'Brien more widely known as Riff Raff in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  I nearly fell off of my seat the first time I saw this movie and he first appeared!<br />You'll not be disappointed at all by this movie if you decide to take the time to sit and watch this movie.  It is however a \\"chick-flick\\" if you haven't already noticed so considered yourself warned.  It's not quite as bad as most of them, but it has the makings to make most men wish to rip their hair out at having to even think about watching this movie.fell off of my seat the first time I saw this movie and he first appeared!<br />You'll not be disappointed at all by this movie if you decide to take the time to sit and watch this movie.

B0000C7PQK|2.0|Good heavens. What the hell is Michael Cretu doing with Enigma? During the intro we got the usual horn piece and then the song kicks in and everything sounds pretty good but then the album quickly goes downhill after that. Yes, that quickly the album disintegrates. The vocals are so awful you can't understand what anybody is saying. There are no more signature enigma sounds such as the pan flutes and monks singing in the background. Now, it's just a bunch of weird computerized noises. What happened to sandra? And get the monks back in the studio!
0553278223|5.0|Even under the guise of a sci-fi book, this book, as other reviewers have pointed out along with the editorials, it is a comment on humanity it the human condition. Even to the point of Man bringing his fears and strong desires to Mars and, after &quot;conquering&quot; the Martians, becoming &quot;Martians&quot; himself. A great work, just like the other sci-fi works I own and love, both new and old: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others.
0393026590|4.0|The follow-up to the successful, \\"Surely you're joking Mr. Feynman\\" this book offers four pretty distinct parts.<br />First section describes how his father taught him to think about the world and his father's ambition to make young Richard a scientist.  The end of the book is Feyman's case for the importance of science.  In between we get the sad, but sweet story of his first wife and the utterly compelling story of his time on the committee investigating the challenger explosion.  It was my favorite part of the book.<br />The description of how government committees decide facts and make recommendations was eye opening.  It was the best description of how these things work that I've ever read.  Feynman was constantly up against a committee chairman that wanted to keep everyone in a room asking questions of experts.  Feynman didn't like that setup.  He wanted to travel out to NASA and talk to engineers, so he did.<br />Going to Huston and Canaveral, Feynman learned something about the nature of NASA that probably goes for any big organization.  He found that NASA was a unified force when their goal was putting a man of the moon.  Information was shared freely and appreciated at every level.  Once that goal was met NASA became compartmentalized.<br />Leaders at the top spent their time reassuring Congress that NASA would achieve their goals with low costs and high safety.  Engineers at the bottom realized that this wasn't entirely possible.  The middle managers didn't want to hear the challenges because they would be forced to report it to the top bosses who didn't want to hear it.  It was much easier for top bosses to paint a rosy picture to Congress if they were unaware of the actual challenges of making it work.  The end result was that top bosses said that the likelihood of a mission death was 1-100,000 while engineers on the ground felt that the likelihood was more like 1-300.<br />Feynman concludes that maybe the shuttle program was a bad idea.  It could never live up to the ambitious projections of the leaders and the American public was being lied to.  NASA should be honest with the American people, Feynman thought, then Congress and voters can decide if they are getting enough for their money.  It was a surprisingly thing to hear from an advocate of science and discovery.  But Feynam reckoned that the amount of science and discovery has been little compared to the cost.  He complained years after the first shuttle launch he still hadn't read any significant experiments in scientific journals.<br />In all, I liked this book a little better than \\"Surely You're Joking.\\"  It was a little more thought provoking than those fun tales.could never live up to the ambitious projections of the leaders and the American public was being lied to.

B0000TB014|2.0|First of all, wheres Smooth Criminal? The best of all MJs videos was disfigured, distorted, ripped off... I just bought the DVD because of that masterpiece of magical dancing! It was just a simple thing to do: getting that part out of the Moonwalker movie and injecting into this DVD! What have they done?!! Second, why not all the videos? Should we still depend on VHS old rags? Third, if not all the videos, at least the best ones, right? So wheres &quot;Ghost&quot;? That is a masterpiece! Wheres &quot;Another Part of Me&quot;? That one is also amazing. They even play it on a huge screen in Disneyland. Wheres the final part of &quot;Black or White&quot; (the one he changes into a panther and dances in a dark street)? At least five minutes were cut out!! Thats why it deserves only two stars. We, old fans, deserved a little more.
B00009RGBS|5.0|A great piece of musical theatre put to the big screen.  Richard Geere is a surprise in the movie, who knew he could sing and dance his way through a film with such great success.<br />The story of Roxie is a reflection of our culture and our obsession with celebrity.  Rene Zellwigger is a convincing &quot;victim&quot; of the celebrity obssessed time. The screen lights up with her beauty and excellent acting ability.<br />Queen Latifah justly deserved the Academy Award nomination (I can't remember if she won or not)  <BR>Lots of talent packed into this movie.  <BR>Highly recomended for those who are musical theatre fans.

0743454529|5.0|For me, the hardest part about reviewing books is having to explain your opinions and thoughts. Not all things I think can be explained. For instance, for years I would eat only square hamburgers. (This went on through high school...) One day I ate a circle hamburger and it turns out, they taste just fine. I can't explain the initial aversion to circle hamburgers or why the quirk went away. It just was.<br />When I select books to read, the selection is usually based on little more than whim. I am a whore for good book covers. I prefer hardbacks to paperbacks because it's much more satisfying the first time you break the spine.<br />I decided to read My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult basically because the main characters in the book are two sisters named Kate and Anna. My younger sister's name is Anna and mine is Kate. Maybe I figured it was fate?<br />My Sister's Keeper is not a great book in the sense that it isn't a challenging read. It is not some scholarly book that will make you feel smarter for having read it. It reads much more like a John Grisham book with a fast pace and rotating narrators.<br />Kate was diagnosed in early childhood with a rare form of leukemia. She needs a transplant and no one in her family is a perfect match. Kate's doctor suggests that her parents could have another child and that the child could be a possible donor. Rather than leave Kate's future to chance, her parents work with a geneticist to give birth to a second daughter who will be an absolute perfect match for Kate.<br />Immediately after her birth, Anna donates her cord blood to Kate. Although originally intended to be the only donation, as Kate's illness progresses, Anna makes several other donations, which requires multiple surgeries.<br />Now, as Kate's life seems to be reaching its end, thirteen-year-old Anna is asked to donate a kidney. Rather than go along with the procedure, as she has in the past, she hired a lawyer. Anna sues for the rights to her own body so that her parents can no longer make medical decisions for her. If she wins her case and elects not to make the kidney donation, her sister will almost certainly die.<br />Picoult story raises questions that will challenge anyone. When does a person get the right to independently make medical decisions? Is it moral to create one child for the sole purpose of saving another? When does the pain of one person outweigh the risks to another?<br />While My Sister's Keeper does focus primarily on the story of Kate and Anna, Picoult keeps the readers interest by also giving voice to the girls' parents and brother, as well as the legal experts in the book.

6304779607|3.0|When people watch the recent &quot;action&quot; movies that have been released in theaters, they definitely are not getting what film-goers got out of action movies in the 80's.  What makes action movies, &quot;Action Movies&quot;, is the obvious lack of story, poor acting, and endless amounts of cheese.  Cobra has it all...and much, much more!  From the group of psychos that are bent on creating &quot;The Way of the New World&quot; to Marion Cobretti, Stallone, and his Zombie Squad, Cobra never lets you forget that it is a terrible movie, which means it is awesome.  The Zombie Squad is supposed to be the misfit cops who do the jobs the &quot;real&quot; cops won't do.  Stallone heads this rag tag crew, which involves only Poppy from Seinfeld fame, against the dirtiest man alive, who leads...the group of men and women who kill hot chicks.  Are you following me?  No? Good.  Some highlights, the soundtrack...trust me, pure cheese, and the give and take between Cobretti and the Lieutenant who disagrees with Cobra's methods, riveting stuff.  The fight at the end between Cobretti and the whole Attractive-Girl Slaughtering Gang deserves an award.  I am not sure what award, maybe a bucket of KFC?  Any way, this movie is atrocious...so buy it to annoy your friends or your girlfriend.
0060589272|4.0|I admit it - I don't like surprises. When I go to a restaurant, I always order the same thing. After all, if I know one thing is good, why try something else? Surprise parties? I hate them - they scare the crap out of me. Plot twists in movies? I think they're so rarely done well, they only annoy me.<br />So when I saw Paulo Coehlo's new book, Eleven Minutes, on the bookshelf, I knew I had to get it. After all, I adored the other book I had read by him, The Alchemist. I reveled in the idea of curling up on my couch with an old friend - how I equate reading books by authors I like.<br />Eleven Minutes is a book about sex. You can cut it other ways, but that's what it comes down to. The title itself refers to the length of time it takes to commit the act. The world we live in revolves around sex, no matter how much people try to disguise or argue that fact. Rather than dispute it or make sex ugly, Coehlo presents sex as a beautiful lesson to be mastered as one gains experience.<br />Maria is a prostitute from a small town in Brazil who gets convinced to move to Geneva, Switzerland, to become a stage sensation. Doing Brazilian dances at a sleazy bar does not bring the fame Maria wishes so she gets out of her contract and tries to fend for herself in Geneva. With no money and little knowledge of the language though, she ends up working as a prostitute.<br />While Maria's entrance into prostitution is probably pretty typical, she is not who one imagines when they think of a sex worker. She visits the library religiously and during downtimes at her workplace, she reads and takes notes on matters of psychiatry, love, sex and farm management. She learns to provide for her clients physical and mental needs. She saves her money and she has adventures while she bides her time until her return home to Brazil.<br />Coehlo makes an astute choice in having the main character in his book, which honors sex, be a prostitute. Through Maria we are able to see some of the ugliest sides of sex. But it is through her development as a character that we are able to appreciate the beauty of the act of sex.<br />In his celebration of sex and love, Coehlo is a success.

The coloring is the best I've ever seen in any comic format in my whole life. John Higgins (the colorist) deserves a credit on the cover with Alan Moore and Brian Gibbons. A wonderful graphic novel which collects a wonderful series.
037542217X|3.0|Fourth in a series about The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency of Botswana, The Kalahari Typing School for Men by Alexander McCall Smith is an easy read. There is nothing terribly exciting or riveting about this novel, but the simple storyline will make you smile.<br />In The Kalahari Typing School for Men Mma Precious Ramotswe and her assistant Mma Makutsi run a detective agency. Business is slow and a competitor has moved into town so the ladies are forced to develop new ways to earn business and money. Mma Ramotswe investigates a complicated case that requires her to use intuition, tact and foresight. Mma Makutsi creates an entirely new way to make money that will also help elevate her from the ranks of assistant detective and help her lead a more full life.<br />Being perceptive of human behavior, Mma Makutsi sees many men around her falling behind in the business world because of their inability to type. They do not want to take classes and be shown up by women, so they end up falling behind technologically. Being a top graduate of secretarial school, Mma Makutsi decides to open a typing classes geared specifically for men. She is able to make use of her contacts at The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and from her secretarial schooldays and suddenly she is in business and finding renewed purpose in her life.<br />As in many good tales, the storylines of Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi become more and more interwoven as the story progresses. The Kalahari Typing School for Men reads like a children's fable written for adults. At no point will the reader be challenged but reading the novel is a pleasure, as Smith's novel reads with the rhythm of life in Botswana.
B000003TAR|5.0|In 1991, &quot;Nevermind&quot; became a huge commercial success, throwing Nirvana and especially Kurt Cobain into the international spotlight, something he dreaded and hated upon its occurrence. Two years later, &quot;In Utero&quot; was released, and it was almost like Kurt's attempt to whittle their audience down -- much like Pearl Jam tried to do with &quot;Vs.&quot; and &quot;Vitalogy&quot; -- except Pearl Jam got to make more records after those. Nirvana, as is common knowledge, did not, and with that knowledge comes a certain aura of significance which surrounds the album. It is viewed by many as Kurt Cobain's suicide note and, whether or not that's true, it's such a hardcore but beautiful and eloquent album that we *want* to view it that way, as something extraordinarily significant.<br />Whether or not it's significant in regards to the rest of Cobain's life, it is most definitely significant in purely musical terms. The lyrics are some of the most haunting and twisted (but in a good way) that have ever been written -- &quot;I miss the comfort in being sad,&quot; &quot;Look on the bright side is suicide, lost eyesight I'm on your side, angel left wing, right wing, broken wing, lack of iron and/or sleeping,&quot; and of course, &quot;All in all is all we are.&quot; Cobain also finds the most inventive way to say &quot;I love you&quot; that I've ever heard -- &quot;I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black.&quot; Wow.<br />Musically, the album is all over the place, from soft songs such as &quot;Dumb&quot; and &quot;All Apologies,&quot; to the scream-fest that is &quot;Scentless Apprentice.&quot; In between are just some solid rock songs propelled by Dave Grohl's superior drumming, such as &quot;Pennyroyal Tea,&quot; &quot;Rape Me,&quot; and &quot;Heart-Shaped Box.&quot; It's not for sensitive eardrums, but it's probably not going to give you a headache.<br />&quot;In Utero&quot; is undoubtedly Nirvana's best offering -- the sound is rawer, the lyricsare gut-wrenching, and the music just makes you want to scream along (especially at the part where he screams &quot;Doll steak! Test meat!&quot; in &quot;Milk It&quot;). Plus, there's just that aura that surrounds it. It's my all-time favorite album, and I highly recommend it for anyone who has emotions.
0440234743|3.0|Like clockwork, John Grisham churns out at least one novel a year, as he has for the past eight years. The Testament, his most recent in paperback, meets all the basic requirements of his previous novels (legalese with tension), but it has a new twist that sets it apart from the rest.<br />Grisham attracted the attention of litigious America in 1992 with his first novel, A Time to Kill, the tale of a lawyer defending a black Vietnam war-hero who killed the men who raped his child. Since then, Grisham's lawyers have found themselves in different compelling plots that make for enjoyable reads without inundating the reader with any deeper meaning.<br />With The Testament, Grisham seems to have left his usually formulaic writing behind - here he creates a deeper, more involved story.<br />Troy Phelan is planning his last will and testament and wants to make sure that his good-for-nothing, money-grubbing children don't get their hands on a red cent of his 11-billion dollar fortune. He plans everything down to the most minute detail and then jumps off a balcony to his death.<br />When the will is finally read to his heirs, everyone is surprised to learn that every last penny is left to Rachel Lane, an unknown, illegitimate daughter of Phelan's, currently working as a missionary in a Brazilian jungle.<br />Josh Stafford and his law firm must ensure Phelan's last wishes are carried through - the first and most difficult task falls upon the shoulders of Nate O'Riley.<br />O'Riley has just finished a stay at a detox center, one of many such programs he has been through. Stafford and his partners decide that sending O'Riley to South America might be the best way to keep him away from the stresses of the law firm for just a little longer.<br />Herein lies the genius of The Testament: Almost the all rest of the book takes place in South America and not in law offices. There are running subplots about the other Phelan heirs and their schemes to undo their father's will, so that they can get what they feel to be their rightful share of the money, but these stories are hindrances to the main plot.<br />With the help of Jevy, an ex-Brazilian army-man who acts as a translator and guide, O'Riley enters the jungles of Brazil as an unprepared American. A suicide attempt, plane crash, boat wreck and bout of Dengue later, O'Riley finds himself more at peace with his life and rather well-acquainted with Lane, the famous Phelan heiress.<br />Rather than churning out a novel filled with his typically entertaining legal mumbo-jumbo, Grisham creates an adventure novel with The Testament, with both romance and a lesson to be learned at the end. Perhaps the greatest pleasure of the book is that the answer to everyone's problems lies not in the hands of a judge, but rather a missionary in South America who neither wants nor needs to be a billionaire. What she does in the end is definitely surprising.<br />There are still court scenes and lawyers galore, but in The Testament, Grisham has written a novel that is decidedly different from his others, and thus very satisfying.they can get what they feel to be their rightful share of the money, but these stories are hindrances to the main plot.<br />With the help of Jevy, an ex-Brazilian army-man who acts as a translator and guide, O'Riley enters the jungles of Brazil as an unprepared American.

038073186X|2.0|This book is worth the read simply because of Lehanes writing - always competent and at times spectacular in his characterizations and economy of style.  As for the substance of the book, it goes limp at the end, the author opting for the same ending done to death by earlier writers such as Fredric Brown, Kurt Vonnegut, and Ray Bradbury.<br />This would have made a brilliant short story.

B000002U82|5.0|There is no excuse for anyone not to have this album in their collection.  It is by far the best rock album ever, not only because the songs are great, but because it shows strength as an album.  Other albums have great songs, but have no overall theme or smooth transfer from one song to another, but on this album, the songs literally blend into one another, and everything is relevant to each other.  The smooth feel to every song helps make the picture that this album tries to make of how society has fallen, and the music's good too.  &quot;Time&quot; has to be my favorite song, due to good music and lyrics like &quot;No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun&quot;, but other good ones are, &quot;Money&quot; for it's catchy tune and truthful lyrics, &quot;On the Run&quot; for it's innovative sound (No one had used synthesizers before at that point) and because it was a great example of how limetless the possibilities were for synthesizers. &quot;Breathe&quot; is a good song because of it's use of convincing using a relaxed tone, &quot;Great Gig in the Sky&quot; for it's amazing vocals, &quot;Any Colour You Like&quot;, for the psycodelic trip it takes you on, &quot;Eclipse&quot; because it's an amazing finish to an amazing album. Other's are &quot;Brain Damage&quot;, for bringing out the lunatic in your head, and &quot;Us and Them&quot;, for mixing jazz with spacey rock.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

B000001ELP|5.0|This remains the one KISS album that I can listen to over and over without getting sick of the repetitiveness. 'The Elder' is a multi-textured, multi-layered masterpiece. <BR>I have had this since 1981, and love it. 'The Oath', 'Only you' and of course 'Dark Light are some of the best KISS songs ever recorded. When the remastered version came out, I grabbed a copy and it was as if a light had been switched on - the songs had been put back in their correct order and the story suddenly made some sense!<BR>If you like KISS, OR orchestrated concept albums (The Wall, etc.) definitely get yourself a copy...

0671042858|5.0|I really enjoyed this horror novel. But I didn't like they way Stephen kept saying that she didn't even notice she was doing it and the way he described to God of the Lost. But overall, this is an awesome book. Very hard to put down.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I have never in my life had a movie-going experience like the one when I saw The Passion.  This movie is very simple: it very graphically portaits the last few hours of Christ's life.  It's not a documentary on His whole life or what He taught (although a few brief snippets pepper the film). It is a very powerful statement of the suffering of Roman torture.  I swear you can feel the pain Jesus' felt.<br />Whether or not you're a Christian, if you have an open mind and want a good history lesson, you will enjoy this film.  It's not feel-good movie by any means, but it is extremely moving and if nothing else you'll really \\"experience\\" getting nailed to a cross.<br />If you are a Christian, you will never look the same at the sacrafice Christ made for you.<br />I highly recommend spending a little time reading the four gospel accounts of Christ's life before seeing this film, especially if you aren't familiar with His history.  You'll get a much better idea of why this movie is so amazing, and why it NOT just a two-hour gore-fest.
B00008S2VG|2.0|My hope was that Madonna's voice would mature over the years. Unfortunately, she hasn't gone beyond 1 octave on most of her offerings. It's sad to say that Britney Spears has a better vocal range. AL is sadly mediocre, not helped by Madonna's flat vocals. I gave this a listen when it first came out, but haven't had the need to give it another listen since.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is definitely Tim Burton's masterpiece, and it should appeal to even those that would not care for his other work, such as Edward Scissorhands. The story combines fact with fantasy that leads the audience to wonder what is real and what is make-believe, much like the story-teller's son, Will, played by Billy Crudup. Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney both play Edward Bloom, who embelishes tales for effect, from encountering singing conjoined Korean twins to meeting the head of the circus who also happens to be part wolf, played by Danny Devito. The tall tales are so imaginative, such as a utopian-like town and a field full of tulips. Interestingly, Burton decided to use real tulips to create the field of tulips instead of CGI, since, &quot;you can tell&quot; the difference. This tale follows the life of a big fish that escaped a little pond to become someone very extraordinary, even if some of it was stretched.
0446608955|5.0|First off, Nicholas Sparks is an absolute fantastic writer.  A Walk to Remember is by far the best book that I have ever read.  It makes you happy when your sad, excited when your bored, it gives you this overwhelming feeling as if you were right there with Landon and Jamie.  The first time that I read A Walk to Remember was 2 years ago for a school summer reading project, I stayed in my room all day and read it because I literally could not put it down.  Although it is also my favorite movie, the book blows it away.  It is a must read for all ages.
0393317552|4.0|This 400 page summation of 13,000 years of history is hard to put down when it begins and hard to finish when you reach its final quarter. Diamond's friendly style draws the reader in immediately, making the book feel not only lively but vitally important as well. What could be more important or interesting than the reasons why the world has turned out the way that it has?<br />Without a doubt, this is an important book, and not because it won a Pulitzer. Diamond makes a convincing case as he argues against notions that were quite popular when he wrote this at the close of the 90s. He refutes the notions of The Bell Curve, which used pretend science to claim that blacks were destined by genetics to be less intelligent than whites and Asians. Instead, he shows that the reasons why Europeans ended up dominating most of the world instead of Africans or native Australians or Americans are myriad, but boil down to a reasonable set, including: Eurasia's size advantage; the fortunate combination of ancient plants and large animals available for domestication; its east-west axis, making the spread of plant and animal domesticates easier by keeping them in the same climate; and its relatively mild barriers, like the Urals, which posed less a division than rain forests, high mountains, and deserts in the Americas and Africa.<br />The thrilling opening and friendly style are eventually tempered by a repetition of these primary causes; Diamond explores numerous situations around the world, from New Guinea to the New World, and makes essentially the same arguments about each region, adding only nuances for the particulars of each place. It's the beginning of the book that's got the goods-the fourth part, especially, is a litany of details that are less captivating because the reader has learned enough to predict many of them. <br />Still, this is a very useful book for understanding the world, and it will arm you with facts to use against anyone who claims that a person's intellect can be predicted by his or her race. Diamond also shows how present conflicts on the world stage are very similar to ones that have been going on for 40,000 years, casting modernity in the same light as prehistory. And, while the fourth part is slower than the rest, the epilogue explains why Europe leapt ahead of Asia in the last millennium, an explanation that is both fascinating and worth learning from. <br />Why did Europe colonize America and not the other way around? If you'd like to know, read this book. It's weighty stuff, but it will reward you richly.
B000001F5F|5.0|First things first - the live performances on this album are outstanding. Why U2 have only ever released one whole live album I will never understand. OK, there are videos/DVD's etc but most hardcore fans had to resort to bootlegs to get concert performances.<br />The only thing that lets this album down is the production: 1. the crowd noise is way too loud 2. Edge is not loud enough in the mix and 3. The sound has a lot of distance/space in it (not sure if that makes sense). If you listen to An Cat Dubh and Twilight (taken from Redrocks) on the Sweetest Thing CD single you will notice how much better the sound is. Thats why I think this album should be rereleased remastered.<br />Aside from that, this is a brilliant album! All the early staples are here and the best version of I Will Follow you are likely to hear. The rest is history...<br />cheers
0060005688|5.0|The counterintuitive title of this book makes sense by page two, which is only the first of many wonders Schwartz makes happen over the course of this deceptively thin and breezy tome. Paradox explains why we feel like we have less time even as technology continues to promise to make life easier. In a nutshell, it's because we have too many choices and invest great amounts of time and mental capital in making decisions that were far simpler or simply didn't exist in the past. Schwartz start with examples like buying jeans--slim fit? baggy fit? classic fit? relaxed fit? tapered leg? button fly? zip fly?--or choosing phone service--AT&amp;T? MCI? countless baby Bells? myriad cellular providers?--but quickly demonstrates that our choices in every area of life, including where to live, who (or whether) to marry, what to do for a living, and much more have expanded to a degree that we not only spend more time contemplating our choices, but experience far more regret afterward--or sometimes, he argues, choose not to choose at all because thinking about all the choices we must forego in order to choose just one paralyzes us--or makes the option we like the best seem less appealing.<br />Schwartz also notes that the increased array of choices combines with the human imagination in dangerous ways that make us sadder. Life gives us choices with fixed qualities--a good job with potential in a city far from home or a decent job with little potential that's close to home--but we compose our own options by assembling aspects of the real choices into fictional options that we then compare with reality. What a surprise that, as we learn of more and more choices, reality falls further and further short! I can't have it all: live close enough to family and retain the freedom to use distance as an excuse to avoid obligations, live in Minneapolis and also in a house with Brad, work with people I loved working with and also return to Illinois. Yet in times of distress, I (and all of us,Schwartz says) tend to compare the situation that troubles me not with a real alternative but with a fantasy constructed from several conflicting components. This is not a useful way to deal with whatever it is that troubles me, or any of us.<br />Fortunately, Schwartz closes the book by offering useful suggestions for understanding the problems unlimited choices pose in our society and dealing with them in our own lives. His book isn't perfect--it gets a bit redundant at times--but it's a fascinating take on a topic that plays a bigger role in modern life than many of us realize.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I have a new hope that George is reading this (or his lackeys).<br />NEVER will I purchase this DVD set.  It's simple, you can't re-write history.

B000089RVR|4.0|This is a very solid album. The first nine songs maintain a consistent level of quality, and &quot;White Flag&quot; is one of the best songs of the year--a poignant reflection on lost love and the unwillingness to let go. The sinking ship is the perfect metaphor for so many reasons: it implies the singer's dedication to her love by evoking the image of the captain who won't leave his ship behind, but also implies that she was the one keeping the relationship running in the first place and probably couldn't--and can't--do anything to save it.<br />Dido uses the setting sun to great effect in &quot;Mary's in India,&quot; another standout song. Standing for the difference in time between Mary and her lover, Danny, back in Britain, and also for the emotional shifts that take place over the course of the song, the sun metaphor looks, in the lyric book, like it pushes the delicate boundary between cleverness and shlock--but Dido's delivery carries the day, and the song itself lands clearly on the safe (and sonically pleasing) side of the line.<br />The last few songs drag a bit--particularly &quot;This Land is Mine,&quot; a mistake in tempo at track 10 on what is otherwise a nearly flaw-free CD. &quot;See the Sun&quot; sets things to rights, and the bonus track is an acoustic--and very pretty--love song, perhaps the most sincere and heartfelt on the album besides &quot;White Flag.&quot;<br />Dido's songwriting remains strong on this album, and her classical training informs a musically interesting work that occasionally slips into sounding too much like itself by maintaining the same mid-tempo beat for much of the album. Nevertheless, that feel suits the songs, and as a result Life For Rent is just as strong as No Angel , if a bit more consistent and lacking an obvious second single. Here's hoping she releases &quot;Stoned&quot; to radio--it has the best danceability on the album, and people will love the title.
B0001O3YD0|1.0|Pitch Black makes the ultimate mistakes a horror/monster/alien movie can make, If the film takes place in pitch black then make it so dark you can't see very well, don't show the creatures until the end, fear of the unknown is far more terrifying, that's what makes the original &quot;Alien&quot; so frightening.  Write a better script this was so full of incondite dialogue and cheesy plot devices it irritated the hell out of me.  Pitch Black had one good thing going for it initially, A GREAT IDEA!!!, but sadly that was dashed to the rocks.  Riddick could have been a great character BUT!... seeing in the dark?!PLEASE!... that's not only ridiculous! it's STUPID! it took the fear of the dark angle down ten notches, and I found him mostly irritating. The creatures looked computer generated and they were so cheesy looking that they weren't scary at all.  Director's take heed, the all time biggest mistake is to show the audience from the killers/monsters point of view/persective/angle it's not scary! it's STUPID!, always show from the protaganist point of view it places the audience in his/her place or put the camera behind the protaganist so that way the audience will feel like they're there with them!. Unfortunately this film suffers from every mistake a good horror film could possibly make and just becomes an uninteresting, forgettable, braindead, eye candy action film and not a very good one at that.
0812550757|5.0|Seriously.<br />It does take some 'work' - the Portugese names are an enjoyable challenge to pronounce right - even in your head.  The story is COMPLEX and brilliant.  It is a standalone book - you need not have read &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (somecentury to a theatre near you!) to read and love this book.<br />If you give it your reader's 'all' - i predict it will move you and open new thoughts you never imagined.  The entire series is like this, but for my mind - this one is the best.  It is satisfying - even with threads left dangling!  The growing series of books built around Ender Wiggin are worth the money and time to acquire and devour ... or maybe you'll savour them slower.<br />Speaker for the Dead - i have read now in excess of 5 times.  More than the rest.  It contains a novel system of ... let us say 'dealing with bereavement' in what i see as a healthy and fulfilling way.<br />That is all you get from me on this subject.  I'll not blunt the sense of discovery that makes this book uniquely powerful - to me at least.<br />WHEN you have absorbed the book and\or the series ; and when you decide the writer is a brilliant voice to be cherished - i highly recommend the following books by him (in no particular order):<br />  &quot;Wyrms&quot;<br />  &quot;Memory of Earth&quot; (the city of Basillica is maybe THE place in all of fiction to which i would permanently relocate.)<br />  &quot;Treason&quot; (- or if you can find the older version &quot;Planet Called Treason&quot;<br />  ALL of &quot;Maps in a Mirror&quot; - specifically  'The Originist'  and &quot;Breaking the Game' .<br />  &quot;Pastwatch - the Redemption of Christopher Columbus&quot;<br />  &quot;Red Prophet&quot; (my choice for best in the 'Alvin Maker' series)<br />Most of his books and some short stories compilations have the first  few chapters (depending on length) available to read online for free at his site:<br />[...]<br />Thank me later - or i welcome the discussion of any of Card's works!<br />-keith-Card's works!<BR>-keith-
B0001US8EO|3.0|Wyatt Earp was ok, but it just doesn't measure up to Tombstone, the movie about the same subject which was released one year earlier.  <br />Pros:  This movie covers all of Earp's life and allows us to see him develop more as a character, especially in regard to his wife and the woman he lived with for most of his life before the city of Tombstone.<br />Cons:  The musical score seemed very repetitive and less-than-impressive.  Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid simply do not compare to the Tombstone performances of Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer (Even though I do not think that Kilmer is that great of an actor, his role as Doc Holiday is one of the best characters I have seen on screen).<br />In comparison, I'd give this movie 2 or less stars, but judging it on its own, I have to give it at least 3, if for no other reason, for its grand scale.
B000062Y98|4.0|This album is awesome. It's blistering! To hear all the details you'll want to hear it over and over. And may be that's the only problem with this disc. Some songs have too much stuff. Cool anyway!
B00007JMCX|5.0|This is one of those films that is best watched in the dark, by yourself, because sometimes, you just might want to shout out &quot;WHAT?&quot; <br />Basically this movie is a great cult classic about an alien who comes to our planet in search of water for his desert planet. David Bowie... how do you rate his performance with that of other conventional actors? You can't. He is brilliant in his role as Mr. Newton! I was completely mesmerized and even attracted to him as the thin redhead. I was surprised however that he was completely unclothed in one scene, but hey, it didn't hurt any part of the movie!<br />I would recomend this to anyone, period. I give the movie a 5, but Bowie's performance gets a 10!
B000002MP2|4.0|One of green day's best. Some of their biggest hits came from this album.Very good album but almost in the end there are songs that could be a little more developed. Nontheless, one of my favourites songs from Green Day is here: (She) This song is superb!<br />NI!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Don't be surprised if this is the last album Dream Theater makes.  I expect members to report the band is taking an indefinite break in the near future, or at least before the next album (code for breaking up but not wanting to make an announcement.)  Unfortunately, you can get to old to rock 'n' roll, as this album illustrates.  I'm a huge fan of their earlier work, which was the only rock music of any style that interested me during the mid 1990s.  I think age has taken his toll. I don't know their precise ages, but I assume most members are in their mid to late 30s.  I cannot think of one metal or hard rock band that did not hit the creative wall as the years rolled on.  The fact that they  would choose to draw on sounds from more than ten years ago when creating Train of Thought really dates them.  The way Dream Theater is plodding along really reminds me of how Queensryche became worse after a certain point.  I question the wisdom of their choices recently.  This album is embarrassing because they already have their own sound and shouldn't try to sound &quot;modern.&quot;   The addition of Jordan Rudess hasn't worked out well at all.  The hype about his talent doesn't match his mediocre contribution to the band.  His sound is totally wrong for this band, no matter how good he is.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|I like Russell Crowe as an actor a lot.  I've admired many of Peter Weir's previous movies.  I like action adventure movies.  I love war stories.  I love history.  And so I anticipated that I would really like this movie \\"Master and Commander\\" and instead....what a disappointment it turned out to be!  What happened?<br />The cinematography and the authenticity of shipboard life and naval warfare in the age of tall ships is terrific.  Kudos.  But that's about it for this movie, and just about everything else fell flat for me with this movie.<br />Russell Crowe plays perhaps the most cardboard cutout character of his career in this movie, the rather unsympathetic, ego-driven war-crazed Jack Aubry.  Crowe's best roles have always been these flawed but ultimately honorable, heroic figures.  Not so here with Jack Aubry.  It didn't help that Crowe inflated himself again to the size of the Pillsbury Doughboy in order to play this role (yes, I know that the novelized Aubry was that size, but still, a fat guy at the helm of a tall ship just doesn't look terribly heroic).<br />Perhaps in a different era, Aubry's determined drive to risk the lives of his men in order to seek out, engage, and defeat the enemy of his king would have appeared heroic.  In the context of our current world, post-Vietnam, and now mired in Iraq, one can only think that this guy was an idiot for taking on unnecessary risks and for throwing away the lives of his men.<br />For that is the one thing that this movie, in its drive for realism, does show.  At the end, a number of the characters that we have become thoroughly acquainted with during the movie get killed in the final battle with the French ship Acheron.  And I couldn't but help think, was this supposed to be heroic?  Just what did Aubry gain from all of this death?  A promotion?<br />As for the rest of the movie, well, others have mentioned already the problems with the plot.  This wasn't just a minor problem.  There were gigantic holes in the plotline.  The lack of a coherent plot just made Aubry's meandering determination to attack the French ship look even more senseless and ridiculous.<br />So here's the plot in a nutshell, see if you can spot the holes:  first, the Acheron catches and fires on Aubry's ship, the Surprise, as both ships are enveloped in a moderately dense fog.  Then, somehow, after getting battered by cannon fire, Aubry manages to escape by having crews on three tiny rowboats tow the Surprise into an  dense fog bank.  Come on, the Surprise must have outweighed those three rowboats by several thousand tons.  And if the Acheron was capable of finding them in the fog in the first place, why didn't it stick around to look for them again in the fog?<br />Then all of a sudden the Acheron is speeding away from them, and Aubry is the one chasing the Acheron.  Oops, chase, what chase?  Let's go explore the Galapagos islands!  Oops, they discover that an English whaler has been attacked by the Acheron, so off they go chasing the Acheron again.  Oops, the Surgeon accidentally gets shot on board the ship and almost dies.  So, in yet another non sequitur, this means that they MUST break off the chase and return at once to the Galapagos so that the Aubry can fulfill his promise to the Surgeon to let him explore the island.  Then, just out of sheer coincidence, the Surgeon finds the Acheron after trekking to the other side of the island!  Change of plans yet again!  Must attack Acheron!  Aubry uses the Surgeon's insect analogy to come up with the brilliant idea of disguising his ship as a whaling ship!  His brilliant plan works!!  The Acheron pulls right up to them to board their ship!!!  Now,wait a minute, I don't know much about ships, but surely those Frenchies were close enough at some point to spot the row of  firing ports on the side of the Surprise?  Surely whaling ships don't carry these large batteries of cannons?  Surely the French captain, described by Aubry at the beginning of the movie as \\"brilliant\\" didn't suddenly go blind and drop a hundred points in IQ?<br />Well, no wonder, the movie had only modest earnings during its theatrical release, despite an enormous amount of hype, including a front page story on Time magazine - can you spell OVERHYPED?  The Cat in the Hat ended up grossing more than this movie in the U.S in 2003!<br />Ecch!  The best part of the movie was when Billy Boyd showed up on screen and my youngest daughter squealed \\"Pippin!!\\"f the movie as \\"brilliant\\" didn't suddenly go blind and drop a hundred points in IQ?<br />Well, no wonder, the movie had only modest earnings during its theatrical release, despite an enormous amount of hype, including a front page story on Time magazine - can you spell OVERHYPED?

B00000K2VZ|5.0|There'll never be another Janis Joplin, and this is the album to have.  <br />For the entirety of it, Janis's passionate, throaty voice sings for every woman who's ever ... been on the road, been dumped, been unfairly led on, been wildly in love and ready to do it again, been annoyed by materialism or - you name it! Her songs speak plainly about her life as a woman who didn't meet all the stereotypes, and who knows what pain -- and joy are.  <br />Her voice is never &quot;pretty&quot;, but always passionate.  <br />If you only plan to have one Janis album -- don't buy a greatest hits.  Buy this one -- PEARL.  These songs need to be enjoyed in their original order.  There's a flow and story in the arrangement.  (Besides, most greatest hits albums will include a lot of songs from this album.)<br />If you buy this and still wish you had BALL AND CHAIN or SUMMERTIME, you can buy a greatest hits album to complement it.  But PEARL is the one you have to have in its entirety.
B0002858YS|5.0|All I know is that Ronnie Vannucci owes me like $5 from that time me, him and Lisa went to the Dairy Queen in my Supra. It's been over 6 years now, and it pisses me off just thinking about it. I'm so mad, if you slit my throat right now you'd get shot in the eye with boiling blood. Besides all this, before he scammed me for my money he \\"borrowed\\" my Paul Simon Best Of CD. You can bet I never saw THAT one again. All I have to say is: watch out world, a darkness is about to overshadow the world, and that darkness has a name, and that name be \\"Vannucci\\".....
B000002H5I|5.0|I think enough time has gone by that this album should finally be called a classic.  <br />With a voice this expressive, lyrics this blunt, and a musical sensibility this exciting and haunting ... Tracy Chapman deserves legendary status for this album alone -- even though she's made more good ones since.  <br />Hard to imagine anyone going through teenaged years without lying in bed and listening to this at least once or twice.  It's gritty and honest -- brutal, yet strangely comforting all at once.  Made a whole generation want to buy guitars and make up their own songs!
0375703764|5.0|I really don't feel like writing an essay like some of the reviewers have, but I would like to say that coming from the perspective of a not-so-avid reader, this book still holds up strong. It really is terrifying and thought provoking on so many different levels. I adore the 'unconventional' structure of this book, as well as all the taboo themes it deals with.<br />There is absolutely no end to the amount of ways there are to read this text(literally as well as figurativly). You won't be finished with it until long after you've finished reading it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd is great You People are Not understanding that they were trying to achieve a mix of all different types of music not just metal or rap or anything but a Mix so please don't say that They don't sound like metal or some other. genre of music when that Is not what they were trying to achieve.  My fav song is: A Place for My Head.
B0001AP12G|5.0|2. We don't care-Awesome beat and awesome lyrics. One of my favorite songs on this CD. I never get tired of listening to this song. 9/10<BR>4.All Falls down-1st single. Syleena Johnson provides some very good vocals. The beat is off the hook and has some banging lyrics. Shows that Kanye West can spit them out with the best of the rappers. 8/10<BR>6. Spaceship-My favorite song on this CD besides \\"through the wire.\\" The soul that rips through it is outstanding and explains diffuculties of his job and growing up. SHould be a single and video. Has a very good beat too and the lyrics are tight. 11/10<BR>7. Jesus Walks-A very contreversial song in my opinion. His second single that deals with Jesus and God being with people. I never get tired of listening to this song. I hope more people will listen to this song. 9.5/10<BR>8. Never let me down-Jay-z really makes this song stand out. His 2 parts before and after Kanye West makes this song one of the best on the CD. 9/10<BR>9. Get'm high-I love the rapping of Talib Kwell in the song. The beat is off the hook. The producing ability of Kanye West is really a stand-out in this song. The rhymning is funny too reminds me of Chuck D.8/10<BR>11. New Workout plan-Hilarious song by Kanye. Talks about drug use, abortion, sex, lies. and etc. Hilarious song. Makes you want to dance.9/10 <BR>12. Slow Jamz-Awesome song by Twista and Kanye West. Of course many people have heard this song, and it has been overplayed by the radio. Twista fast rapping makes this song into a classic. Jamie Foxx is outstanding too.10/10<BR>13.Breathe in Breathe Out-Alright song. Ludacris does a funny chorus.Probably the worst song on the CD.4/10<BR>15. School Spirit-Funny song. I really didn't get it that much for some reason. Has some funny lyrics. 7/10<BR>17. Two Words-Freeway makes this song go. Has a very good chorus probably the best on the whole CD. Describes the life of America and how other countries are starting to see the light. One of my faves.10/10<BR>18. Through the Wire-Kanye West samples Chaka Slan and Marvin Gaye here. When I first heard it, that was when I became a big fan of Kanye. Everything about the song is perfect lyrics, beat, chorus, and etc. 12/10<BR>19. Family Business-Talks a lot about family and growing up. Another great song on this CD. The kids singing on it was the a great idea.10/10<BR>20. Last Call-Alright song. 6/10
B000002LOE|3.0|OUT OF TIME stands as something of a paradox in R.E.M.'s discography.  Even though it's R.E.M.'s most inconsistent album, OUT OF TIME ushered in a new, radical phase in the band's career, moving them far and away from such groundbreaking recordings as MURMER or RECKONING.  Because of the massive hit \\"Losing My Religion,\\" R.E.M. came out from the underground and began their mainstream career.  While all the subsequent records (AUTOMATIC, MONSTER, NEW ADVENTURES, UP, and REVEAL) have moved them further along the lines of reinventing their sound, this transformation started here.  <br />Ironically enough, this is R.E.M.'s worst album, although this is the very record that broke them into mainstream and enabled them to make some of the greatest music of their career. While many purists despise this album, I personally feel that without this record which brought R.E.M. such massive success, we wouldn't have those great later day records.  It may have turned off a lot of fans, but OUT OF TIME brought R.E.M. to national attention.  Still, it can be hard to swallow some of this record.<br />Filled with sonic grooves and textures, bright, shinny production, and lots of outside collaboration, OUT OF TIME finds R.E.M. moving away from the more jangly pop and underground sound of their IRS years to a more mainstream, streamlined sound.  (\\"Radio Song,\\" one of the more bizaare collaborations with rapper KRS-1, is a fun, jaunty little song, but still sounds, after all these years, as a rather misguided and a largely failed experiment.) The biggest problem with OUT OF TIME is, after the record finishes, there's not a lot to return too.  It's a shiny, happy record, without much substance.  <br />Any record where the production is more noteworthy than the songwriting is in deep trouble, and that is exactly where OUT OF TIME suffers.  I do admire the band's ambition to broaden and deepen their sound, bringing in mandolins, keyboards, and even string sections.  It's just the songs on OUT OF TIME are so breezy and insubstantial that is plays like a 1970s Wings album.  It gets in a mellow, sunny groove, more concentrated on making a pleasant summer record than making lasting music. Like \\"Shiny Happy People,\\" OUT OF TIME is a great catchy album overall but when it comes down too it, stripping away all the bright production and concentrating on the album itself, there's not really that much to it.  Even the title has that tossed off feel.  The band laterally ran out of time to come up with a title, hence the name.<br />However, when the band does get the songwriting right, then OUT OF TIME strikes gold.  The aforementioned \\"Losing My Religion\\" deserves all the acclaim it gets.  (Who'd think a mandolin driven song would be such a huge hit???)  \\"Half a World Away,\\" \\"Texarkana,\\" and \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" are essential songs.  Also, the two outtakes on the bonus disc from IN TIME, R.E.M.'s recently released greatest hits compilation, would have greatly aided this record.  \\"Fretless\\" and \\"It's a Free World Baby\\" are both more substantial than most of the material here and Buck even said to send in a resequenced setlsit to the band because they were thinking about reissuing this album with these two songs incorporated into it.<br />The real masterpiece, however, is the phenomenal song \\"Country Feedback.\\"  Capturing a general psychic unrest and a searching for meaning, \\"Country Feedback\\" is easily my favorite song on the album and one of my top ten R.E.M. songs.  The lyrics reminds me \\"E Bow the Letter.\\"  Both \\"E Bow\\" and \\"Country Feedback\\" have a very distinctive, haunting style that never fails to capture my ear, with wonderful, free association lyrics wedded with R.E.M.'s great instrumental sensibilities.  One of R.E.M.'s best.  Great live version on IN TIME on the B-Side disc.<br />In the end, OUT OF TIME never really offends; it just never really makes you think other than the two aforementioned masterpieces.  It's a pretty fun record to listen too, but not something to return too time and time again. It's ironic that this is the album that catapulted them into mainstream radio, given OUT OF TIME's spotty nature.  R.E.M. made great records before this, and they made wonderful records after this.  We can thank OUT OF TIME for coming at that critical juncture, that linchpin record that secured R.E.M. a place in 1990s mainstream rock.  Just wish it was a more substantial record than what it is.

Highly recommended tape set. Well worth the price. And glad that Kiyosaki appreciates and understands network marketing.
B0000DCGT1|4.0|I totally enjoyed this movie. It was well made, well acted and evoked many emotions in me. I am not a large horse racing fan but never-the-less I was captivated by this movie. I would own it!
B00028HBKM|5.0|I do not claim to be an expert on religion. I have heard all of the controversial comments that this movie did not coincide with the actual happenings and the Jews were misrepresented. All I know is that was a  great movie by Mel Gibson. There was not one dry eye in the theatre when it was over and I have been hearing all sorts of good things onhow this movie compelled people to get closer to the church after it was released, here in America and in other parts of the world.<br />And YES--I will buy the dvd. It is rare that a movie of this   quality comes out.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like many who have written reviews here, I'd never seen Firefly during its TV run and decided to buy the DVD set based on my faith in Joss Whedon and on word of mouth.  I'm halfway through the set and am enjoying the series more with each episode.  The pilot, in particular, I thought was truly fine -- I would happily have to gone to see it more than once as a first-run film release.  I found the second episode to be a slight let-down, but since then they've only gotten better and better.  I can't believe Fox cancelled a program this good.  (Wait a minute, we're talking about Fox -- Simpsons aside, I can believe they cancelled a program this good.)<br />Great writing, great acting, great special effects -- an exceptional, kickass series.  Hope Joss W. does it justice in the big-screen version now filming.<br />Buy it.
B000002UAO|5.0|In a recent poll,rolling stone declared this the 5th greatest album ever,vh1 said the 6th greatest album ever! Containing gems like Michelle,Nowhere man,In my life and Girl,its no mystery why this album is so well loved...oh,its true!!!
B000089RVX|1.0|I think it's sad when one gets their break from a bad movie like &quot;Daredevil&quot;. They were the only reasonably decent thing, besides Jennifer Garner ( as eyecandy ) in that horrible movie. <BR>But that being said, they still rank low on my list of good bands.<br />Amy Lee seems to want to try and channel some wierd mix of Sarah Brightman and Sarah McClaughlin(sp?) in most of the material on this album.This is most apparent in Bring Me To Life. And as much as I hate My Immortal for as much as it reminds me of a cat loving ex of mine, it's even worse as a song from a pure song standpoint...someone like Diane Warren probably could have written it in their sleep. Dig up some old Ministry or Nine Inch Nails if you want some really good angst-ridden music, or even some Skinny Puppy if you want some music that has a really Goth tinge to it. Evansecence is Faux Goth.
B000003S0I|5.0|I was recently very bored so I was searching through my dad's box of vynils and came across Larks tongues in Aspic. Ever since I heard this album King Crimson  has been one of my favorite bands This is one of those albums that changes your life in a good way. Alongside with Grunge rock I am also getting into Progressive rock. Every single song on this album is amazing from start to end. The first song(Larks Tonge In Aspic Part 1) is just as powerful and aggressive as the song Red. It features a booming bass from John Wetton and then rapid fire guitar licks from Robert Fripp. The other songs are just as good. I play violin and viola myself so I really appreciated David Cross's musical abilites on almost every song. The rest of the album is in general a lighter more folksy side of King Crimson. The Book of Saturday is a very harmonic song, so is Exiles, I think that Exiles is just about the most buetiful song I've ever heard. The other songs are just as great especially Easy money. I think that Bill Brufford is THE best drummer to date and it shows in this album in a more discreet and melodic way. If you like any kind of music you should buy this CD it is amazing. This is the best King Crimson album.
B0000399WI|5.0|This review is going to be quite short, as I don't have time to write a full review as I'd like to.  As a fan of comedies such as American Pie and South Park, I have to say that I was suspicious when our college english class had to watch this movie.  I didn't think it would be fun at all.  However, when the movie was over, I wanted to see it again.  Unlike many other movies like it (i.e., Titanic), it is not cliche; it is very original, and unpredictable (you never seem to suspect that Andy is going to escape).  All characters are developed, and the plot and ending are very satisfying.  The theme is not necessarily noticable from a mile off, which deals with having hope even in the most hopeless of situations (like being in a prison).  The story draws you in from start to finish.  Well done!  (also, for those of you who are appalled that I mentioned Titanic in a less than perfect light, I'd like to say this openly: TITANIC SUCKED!!  It was the epitome of cliche and predictibility; everything that happened you could see from a mile off, the characters were lame and SAPPY, as you can expect when Leonardo DeCaprio is in the cast, and the story was all over the place.  Easily one of the worst 10 movies I've ever seen).
B00025ETIW|4.0|if you connected in an intense, personal way (as i did) with \\"bullets\\"...the first few songs of \\"sweet revenge\\" will throw you off.<br />the subject matter's changed...the vocals have become more singing, less screaming....and everything has...mellowed.<br />(well, mellowed as much as MCR could possibly mellow)<br />but by the time the album hits its midpoint, it becomes clear: this is a more mature, sonically-expanding MCR, not content with the vampire narratives and tortured, throat-shredding tales of love lost and dead from the first album. here we've got cautionary tales of fame, narratives of the undead (again and still, and probably always), as well as a song full of neil gaiman/sandman references (\\"it's not a fashion statement it's a deathwish\\"). <br />it's a band growing up. and taken with that perspective, this album is every bit as brilliant and emotive as the first, but a bit less on the surface.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I can't stop watching it. The music always gives me goose bumps and I cry every time Crowe says goodbye to the little girl. And I never even noticed the pigeons the first time!....duh.
1400032717|5.0|As a high-functioning autistic adult and parent of a child with PDD-AS, I found it very interesting how the autistic mind is characterized by the author.  I was intrigued by the writing style, because it parallels my own--seemingly random, unrelated ideas that are actually tightly integrated in a nonlinear, relational matrix--where footnotes and parenthetical phrases abound.  The book's character, Christopher Boone, reminds me of my son-- who was similarly enthralled by the book, although thoroughly upset by the prospect of an impaled canine.  I urged my mother to read the book, and she, too, found it to be odd, but fascinating.<br />Other reviewers suggest this book is entertaining, at the least.  I think it is a wonderful book for helping others to begin to understand the world in the mind of a pre-teen kid with autism.
6302212529|5.0|Disney's 1989 animated film THE LITTLE MERMAID is a very formidable movie, surpassing the combined visual and musical artistic talents of all concerned. Character development is one of the strong points of THE LITTLE MERMAID achieved through concise dialogue, music and simplistic yet effective images. However, most effective to the success of this film are the songs that advance the story line and define the characters. That was the brilliance of lyricist Howard Ashman's contribution to THE LITTLE MERMAID.

So in THE LITTLE MERMAID we are given a substantial amount of information and entertainment in a minimum amount of time. There is not a single frame of wasted footage in this film.

B0001NIUWG|5.0|Wasn't expecting this &quot;unauthorized&quot; Queen DVD to be as good as It really is.  Nothing spectacular, yet interesting.  Talks about where each of the guys come from, then as Smile....and so on and so on.  Many interesting people interviewed on this DVD.  Including Tim Staffel, Ibex members, and etc...I just received this in the mail a few hours ago...and just finished watching it.  I could watch it once again.  I think it's puts into perspective just how big Queen really is..and will always be.  Especially Freddie's always knowing behavior or what the right thing to do was....and we all know now just how correct he was!  Of course I'm still sitting here wanting more and more info and more to watch about Queen and Freddie.  But for a quick $16.00 or so....I now feel special as to having this DVD.  I think any Queen fan could and would appreciate this one.  I now feel that much closer to Queen as a fan and will always love Queen for what they have done and what they are continually doing.  This is from a young 21 year old Queen fan.  This DVD is essential to any true Queen collector or fan!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This album has recently been certified quintuple(5)-platinum!  It is obvious that Evanescence is talented: They won Best New Artist at the Grammys and their album is doing very well in sales.  <br />Now, the ALBUM:  What can I say?  Whatever Amy Lee says, she says well and with very powerful meaning behind it.  There is a wide variety of songs on this album, from the haunting, quiet &quot;My Immortal&quot; to the powerful blast of &quot;Bring me to Life&quot; and &quot;Going Under.&quot;  The album sort of tells a story.  The songs have an interesting relation to one another.<br />I truly believe that this band will go far, despite the loss of Ben Moody (he left the band).  They work well together and present a meaning to hard Rock, and aren't just about going crazy and getting drunk and head banging.  I highly regard Amy Lee for doing so.  She does not want to be compared with traditional bands.  What a great start!

B000007VCM|5.0|This is the best recording of rock I've ever heard.  I got this CD in '87, a few years after it was released.  Actually, I bought it and &quot;Electric&quot; at the same time, as the latter was just released.  I was lucky enough to pick up the original &quot;BEGA 65 CD&quot; (Beggar's Banquet) version, with the gold lettering on the front cover.  It had two extra songs on it (&quot;Little Face&quot; and &quot;Judith&quot;) as well as liner notes--lyrics to all the songs on the CD, inscribed in that odd, neo-egyptian script that you see on the front and back covers of the CD.  In 1990, I saw this same CD on a website of RARE recordings going for $60, so if you see it anywhere and its affordable, pick it up.  <br />The songs contained within are incredible.  Unfortunately, there are a few mellow tunes (&quot;Brother Wolf...&quot; and &quot;Black Angel&quot;) that will really make you want to cry or sleep, depending on your mood.  They are good, and the lyrics are well crafted, but they are too long.   There are a couple of Euro-Pop tunes (&quot;Nirvana,&quot; &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Revolution&quot;) which sound kinda 'blah' now, but they are listenable.  The true treasures on this Cd alone make it a 5-Star purchase:  &quot;Big Neon Glitter,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; (so good, they used the same riff later for the ELECTRIC version of &quot;Wild Flower&quot;), &quot;The Phoenix,&quot; (no 80's song rocks this hard or well--not one...it still gives me goose bumps), &quot;Hollow Man,&quot; (I heard a band cover this a few years ago...a buddy at the show asked me, 'is that a Foo Fighters song?') and &quot;She Sells Sanctuary.&quot;  Though I mentioned it as a negative, &quot;Brother Wolf...&quot; is a great song, too.  It's 7 minutes long, though.<br />There will never be another rock CD like &quot;Love.&quot;  Ian and Billy saw to that--they scrapped the follow up album (to be titled, &quot;Peace&quot;) and rerecorded all of the songs with a new sound (&quot;Electric&quot;).  In a strange, dysfunctional way, this CD reminds me of Queens of the Stone Age's &quot;Rated R,&quot; (not the way it sounds) in that it's innovative, it's a little ahead of it's time despite borrowing from earlier genres, and it rocks in so many different ways, and on so many different levels.<br />You wanna now how this CD rocks?!?!  Ask Ian: &quot;Like a kiss from the lips of Ra that burns on....rising ever higher....a Phoenix from a pyre...my eternal desire....FIRE!!!&quot;

B00005JMX6|4.0|Remember when you saw the first \\"American Pie?\\" It was funny, it was crude, and it was also sweet. The characters were well written and you genuinely cared about them. The same can be said for \\"The Girl Next Door.\\" A new sexy comedy from Luke Greenfield whose previous films include \\"The Animal.\\" In the girl next door we are once again thrust into the high school hell. Douche bag jocks, snotty girls, and geeks are all accounted for, and of course the geeks shall inherit the earth. The title character Danielle, (played perfectly by the gorgeous Elisha Cuthbert \\"24\\", \\"Old School\\") moves next to uber-student, presidential hopeful Matthew (Emile Kidman, previously in \\"The Emperor's Club, The Secret Life of Altar Boys.) And naturally his world is turned upside down. Now Matthew is living his life, and doing things he would have never dreamed of, from sneaking into his principals pool, to jogging naked. Danielle has a secret though, she's not on hiatus from college, and she's in-town because she's hiding from her last career...PORN!! So she's hot, the movie is funny, and she's an ex-porn star, is there any reason not to see it? The Girl Next Door is much more than a 21st century teen sex comedy, its well written, smart, and has genuinely great performances. Matthew is a character you want to see succeed, you want him to get the girl because a.) She is ungodly hot, but more because b.) He might just deserve her, and The Girl Next Door also deserves a look.
0759598029|5.0|I never liked reading until I piked this book up.  I couldn't put it down,  I have never sat down and read a book because I wanted to, it was becase I had to.  This book was excellent, I would tell everyone to read this book.  Thanks
B00006RAKP|5.0|Yes I realize there is always considerable consternation among collectors about the plethora of \\"Best of\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\" packages that are put on the market every year.  Some artists simply don't warrant a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection while the music of more important and prolific performers is constantly being repackaged.  But if you are someone like me \\"Elton John Greatest Hits 1970-2002\\" is a fine value.  This collection replaces 3 previous vinyl \\"Greatest Hits\\" albums I now own. I will be keeping those vinyl LP's for the tunes that were not included in this particular package.<br /><br />I must say that Universal has done an outstanding job with the series of anthologies they have released in the past couple of years.  This collection offers up 34 of Elton Johns' biggest and best.  There is no doubt that everyone will probably quibble about a few of the tracks that were included as well as those that failed to make the cut.  But overall,  I am quite pleased with this one.  Just about all the big ones you would expect to find are included.  Among the hits that did not make it are 1979's soulful \\"Mama Can't Buy You Love\\" and 2 hits from 1982 \\"Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny)\\" and the wonderful \\"Blue Eyes\\".  The collection comes in a very attractive package that includes a nicely done 40 page booklet.  One of the unique features of the booklet is a fold-out section showing all 41 album covers from Elton Johns' fabulous career. The remastering on these tracks is also first rate.  Again, if the price of this collection was $29.99 I would be much more critical.  But the price is quite reasonable for a collection you are sure to enjoy for years to come.  Highly recommended.
B000007WNN|4.0|This is a true American Rock album, and you'd almost have to call it &quot;neoclassical,&quot; in that it pays homage to an earlier era by imulating &amp; incorporating elements/highlights of that era.  I read a review here where someone credits the influence of &quot;Zodiac Mindwarp.&quot;  Brilliant!  (as those 2 Guiness guys would say).  This is true; the Cult really did shed their English Pop-Rock image, move to America, and release &quot;Electric,&quot; the only post-70's rock album I ever listened to at the time.  It made me think of Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, Deep Purple and Zodiac Mindwarp, most of all.  Let's go back, though, to the year after the The Cult's album &quot;Love&quot; was released...<br />The guys began writing and recording for their next album, which was to be titled, &quot;Peace.&quot;  They recorded the bulk of the songs at a place called &quot;The Manor.&quot;  The recordings sounded like the &quot;Love&quot; sesions, except for one small difference--Billy Duffy perfected the art of &quot;new&quot; rock--every song had 3-5 guitar tracks.  Every song sounded like there were 4 or 5 guitars playing at once.  One playing a lead, one rhythm, and 1 or 2 overplaying harmonics, a catchy little 3 note riff, or a crunchy droning power chord.  The song &quot;Outlaw,&quot; for instance, is as loud and rocking as &quot;The Phoenix,&quot; except there are MORE guitars...Billy plays solos right over top of Ian's vocals, like on &quot;Phoenix.&quot;  I could go on and on...I was blown away by the Manor Sessions, plain and simple.  It was &quot;Love&quot; with no slow mellow songs!  Ian and Billy weren't satisfied, had a falling out with the producer (who, unbelieveably, was giving Ian and Billy virtual free-reign in the studio) and after receiving advice that the newly recorded &quot;Peace&quot; (the Manor Sessions) was never going to be a big hit in the USA, they move their home base to America, and re-recorded every song under the directionof Def Jam psycho metal-head/rap producer Rick Rubin.  EVERYTHING CHANGED!  &quot;Wild Flower&quot; for example, became the American version of the song &quot;Love&quot; (listen to the music--it's the same notes, put to a different drum beat)...Aphrodisiac Jacket and Born to be Wild were composed (well, not BTBW) and recorded on the spot, mostly by Rubin, and many of the other songs were reduced (guitar-wise) to fit this new hollow, shallow, &quot;70's rock&quot; biker/Easy Rider sound.  Thing was, 70-s rock  songs didn't have very many guitar tracks--the technology was just not there!  Rubin decided &quot;Electric&quot; would be a better record title.  Rubin also added some of his own guitar tracks to the recording.  I think Ian and Billy relied too heavily on others' advice (like they always do) and redid a perfect album to make it an American 70's rock album.<br />I love &quot;Electric,&quot; but I prefer the Manor Sessions.  If you are a fan of &quot;Love&quot; (one of the greatest CDs I've ever purchased) songs like &quot;Phoenix,&quot; &quot;Hollow Man,&quot; &quot;Love,&quot; &quot;Big Neon Glitter&quot; and &quot;She Sells Sanctuary,&quot; do yourself a favor and find the Manor Sessions.  I guarantee you will be shocked to hear these earlier recordings: the wall of guitars, the fierce SINGING vocals of Ian (not the loud yelling he did for Rubin's recordings)...this is why I can only give &quot;Electric,&quot; one of my favorite CDs, 4 Stars...I know what it was and where it came from.  Anyone who owns this CD needs to get the earlier recordings, and vice versa.
B000002LGQ|5.0|THIS ALBUM PROVED THAT MADONNA WAS MORE THAN A POP TART. THIS ALBUM REALLY PROVED SHE HAD SOMETHING TO SAY. I THINK LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE SUPRISED AT HOW GOOD A SONGWITER SHE WAS. THESE SOUND HAVE SO MUCH HEART AND LEAVE YOU WITH YOUR HEAD A MESS. OH FATHER TIL THIS DAY STILL REAMINS MY FAVORITE MADONNA BALLAD. ITS SO HAUNTING AND SAD, YET A VERY SIMPLE SONG. I AGREE WITH MANY OTHERS YOU COULD NO LONGER DENY THE TALENT THIS WOMAN POSSESSED. I WAS ONLY 11 WHEN THIS WAS RELEASED AND IT STILL REMAINS ONE OF MY FAVORITE MADONNA DISCS TO DATE.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|costumes, two hours on a ship, no women - I thought for sure i would hate it so i did not go to see it at the cinema - but while scraping the barrel for dvds to watch I got this in the end and it is superb! I could hardly breathe for excitement in part and was SO disappointed when it drew to a close as I wanted it to go!<BR>The cinematography is stunning - I had to pause it several times to remind myself that I was not in fact onboard HMS Surprise. The acting is fabulous by everyone and the story line is gripping. I loved it.

B0001GF2DS|5.0|Mr. Q. Tarantino, R. Rodriguez, and many others were inspired by this movie.<br />Now, with an even better feature. A 2 Disc Extended verison.<br />It is a must buy. The music is remarkable, the plot is nicely done, Cast perfect, and above all the Sergio Leone Touch gave the movie The Western that IMHO no American Movie was able to produce.<br />Do yourself a favor. And watch the trilogy in its correct order:<br />A fist full of Dollars, For a few dollar more, and The Good The Bad and The Ugly.<br />Each Movie is not related to the other (from a story point of view. But so you can see how the efforts continued to improve.
0425163407|5.0|Loved the book!! I've read most of the Kay Scarpetta series books and have enjoyed each one.  This one was unique in it's subject and style.  If you love a good mystery, Patricia Cornwell can write them and you won't be disappointed!
B000002UAC|5.0|The Beatles top their debut with their second album; from the spring of '63, when they recorded Please Please Me, to the fall of '63, when they released this album, they had gone from a local Liverpool group with a hit single to Britain's biggest stars. Over the summer, Beatlemania had exploded and now the Fab Four were playing the Palladium and a Royal Command Performance rather than the Cavern. Check out the covers, and you'll see the difference. The four eager kids on the first album have morphed into the cool, aloof icons on this one. And the music? This is where the Beatles kick off their flight to ever loftier heights. This is more rock and roll than Please Please Me, and it's faster and more urgent as well. John's performance on Please Mr. Postman is outstanding; he's said he was the leader of the group at this point, and on With the Beatles his peculiar voice dominates most of the songs he sings on. It Won't Be Long kicks off with a jarring variation of the &quot;yeah yeah yeahs&quot; from their hit single She Loves You, Little Child is an underrated classic where Lennon changes his voice every line, veering from sensitive and sorrowful to tough and deep, and Money closes the album sardonically with a gleeful celebration of greed. Paul's no slouch either, effectively crooning the show tune Till There Was You and memorably delivering All My Loving, the most famous song on the album. And George has his first composition with Don't Bother Me, which is not highly regarded but very good nonetheless. It has the strange Harrison touch which is recognizable in so many of his songs. Ringo sings I Wanna Be Your Man (a song written for the Rolling Stones-legend has it that when Jagger and Richards saw Lennon and McCartney compose it in a few minutes, they were encouraged to take on songwriting themselves), plays the bongos on Till There Was You, and bangs an Arabian bongo on Don't Bother Me. This LP (CD now) moves the Beatles beyond their humble origins and thrusts them into the realm of musical superstars. They could've stopped here and their reputations in Pop would still be secure. But no, they didn't. This was just the beginning...<BR>5/6
B000099T2L|5.0|The original Independent Woman, #1 Bootylicious One herself has finally released her debut album -and MAN was it worth the wait and every penny I spent on this CD.<br />&quot;Crazy In Love&quot; -obviously the most played song on MTV, BET, etc.<br />Complete w/ rapper/boyfriend Jay Z and Chi-Lite sample, B blazes through this one with ease.<br />&quot;Naughty Girl&quot; -another one where Ms B tantalizes and teases with &quot;tonite I'll be your naughty girl&quot; and with a hook from Donna Summers' &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;.  Who knew B had it in her?<br />&quot;Baby Boy&quot; -f/dancehall star of the momenet, Sean Paul.  Blazing beat, banging song.  B really out does herself on this one.<br />&quot;Hip Hop Star&quot; and &quot;Be With You&quot; I wasn't feeling at first.  But then like B's songs tend to do, they grow on you.<br />&quot;Me, Myself &amp; I&quot; -a mellow tune about &quot;being your own best friend&quot;.  Rumor had it, that she wrote this song after allegedly hearing rumors that bandmate Kelly Rowland was talking bad about her behind her back.<br />B keeps the heat moving with &quot;Yes&quot;, &quot;Signs&quot; w/ Missy Elliot, &quot;That's How You Like It&quot; w/ recent retiree Jay-Z.<br />Ms B also solicits help from (Mr Romance)Luther Vandross on the remake of Roberta Flack's &quot;The Closer I Get To You.&quot;  Not bad, B.  I am not sure if the original needed a facelift or not, but this is a good remake.<br />&quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot;, Interlude, &quot;Gift From Virgo&quot;, and the ultra-sweet &quot;Daddy&quot; finish off this CD.<br />All in all, this CD is worth every penny.  As well as the money that I spent at her Ladies' First Concert.  B has grown and matured into the talented singer/songwriter we all knew she'd become.  Congrats, B!
0425152251|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It is indeed a history of philosophy but is revealed through the interactions of Sophie and her mysterious 'teacher'. There seems to be 3 stories going on at once throughout the book, which keeps it interesting. There is a twist near the end that totally blew me away. The ending was a bit 'out there' for me but overall I loved every bit of this book and plan to read it again. Anyone who has an interest in philosophy, human history, or just interesting stories will like this book. I also enjoyed this book because the characters are not American and the story does not take place in America. New perspectives are always a good thing for me, and Sophie's World is a marvelous window to see the world through.
B000001FOL|4.0|This album has a distinct, haunting flavor to it, and is not for those who judge music by technique, especially by the technique of the singer.  Nico's voice is very flat and dead pan, and in this case, it brilliantly fits with the songs. Her voice is suprisingly beautiful, and will resonate deeper within you than most, perhaps technically better, singers.  Since her voice is so strange, you probably will not like it at first, but after a few listenings, something clicks and you just get it.  This is an album that is easily personalized, and it will become a part of you that you will be glad to have discovered.
0385336810|5.0|Loved this book.  Cannot possibly say enough good things about it.  The &quot;ers&quot; and &quot;ums&quot; were a bit much at times, but this book does not disappoint.  I read it in a night because I couldn't put it down.  The characters were funny and sweet.  You could feel and share in the humiliation of Emma and her feelings toward family and co-workers, especially when Jack comes to the office, knowing her &quot;secrets.&quot;  I loved Emma and Jack's characters and I thought it was very good.  Very highly recommend it.  I have not read Ms. Kinsella's other books but this was a great start.  Very funny and sweet.  Reminded me very much of Bridget Jones Diary.  Go read it!
0385510438|2.0|It's been awhile since I read a John Grisham novel because I'm not a big fan of contemporary writing.  However, after reading the dust cover of The Last Juror, I was hooked.  I braced myself for a thriller reminscent of A Time to Kill (after all both books were set in the same small Mississippi town).  I was sorely disappointed.  Grisham tosses in almost everything but the kitchen sink in this novel as he waxes poetic on small town life in Mississippi, the evils of Wal-Mart, and the wonders of Southern cooking.  This is a great sentimental novel but as a thriller it lacks punch.
B00006879E|3.0|This is a good cd. I feel like the radio ruined the songs that they've put out, by overplaying them. Please stop, it makes it harder to listen to it on the cd. ANYHOW, it's a cd that has to grow on you, but these guys are very talented by writing their own stuff. THey have a different sound.. it's like soul and rock put together. I dunno how to describe it, but they do their own thing and it's good. She will be loved, is one of teh best songs on the cd.
B000267JQK|5.0|When I first heard that Seether was re-releasing \\"Disclaimer\\" I was a little worried that they were on the verge of selling-out.  But out of respect for the band, I bought this CD on the day of its release.  I was 100% WRONG on my original thoughts of the CD.<br />Seether has re-recorded, and re-mastered the truly awesome songs off of \\"Disclaimer\\" and they sound so much better.  The remastered songs sound 100% better and more professional than the original cuts of the songs on \\"Disclaimer\\".  Even the band says on their website that they were never truly happy with the original mastered versions of the songs.  The added guitar harmonics in \\"Driven Under\\" just gave me chills, they blend together so well with the song.<br />Seether also has added 8 new tracks to the CD.  All of the new tracks are excellent, except for the new version of \\"Broken\\" which features guest vocalist Amy Lee from Evenescense.  The original acoustic version of \\"Broken\\" was so much better than the new one made for \\"The Punisher\\" album.  Amy Lee's vocals are too loud and they completely drown out the original and better vocals of the ACTUAL composer of the song, Shaun Morgan.  It's not Amy Lee's song, so why does she have to be more noticable than Shaun, who created the song in the first place??  But aside from all of that, the extra tracks are awesome.  \\"Sold Me\\" is one of the greatest songs I have ever heard, and \\"Got It Made\\" is right up there too.<br />The only other flaw with this album (other than the new version of \\"Broken\\") is the title.  \\"Disclaimer II\\" just doesn't sound right.  It sounds like a movie sequel.  I know it's a minor problem, but come on, I would have taken something like \\"Disclaimer: Special Edition\\" or \\"Disclaimer: Remastered\\" or something like that, but \\"Disclaimer II\\" just sounds stupid and half-assed, like they didn't wanna spend time picking out a name that worked.  But the name doens't effect the awesomeness of the CD in any way.  It was just something that bothered me.<br />The Bonus DVD is awesome.  The live footage is truly worth having and the videos are pretty cool as well.<br />So, over all, \\"Disclaimer II\\" is truly an awesome CD. If you were a big fan of \\"Disclaimer\\", like I was, times that by like 100 and you end up with \\"Disclaimer II\\".  This album is definately worth the buy for old and new Seether fans.  Just re-release the new version of \\"Broken\\" either without Amy Lee, or just take her vocal level down just a little bit so we can actually hear Shaun Morgan, and Seether will be on its way to being one of the greatest hard rock bands out right now.(...)
0061015725|2.0|Frankly I was disappointed. Michael Crichton takes what could be an intriguing and potentially apocalyptic idea (predatory swarms of evolving nano-machines on the loose) and boils it down to week-long crisis that involves relatively few people. It's easy to see why the author is so popular: There is nothing remotely challenging about his prose, which is easy to skim and even easier to digest, with plenty of pretentious techno-babble thrown in along the way. There's also a mild indictment of corporate irresponsibility and carelessness here, but none of it's enough to make you care very much. This novel is tailor-made for a two-part ABC miniseries, and that's about it. I loved &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; as a kid, I was thrilled by &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; .... but I found &quot;Sphere&quot; too puzzling and &quot;Timeline&quot; really weak. After reading &quot;Prey,&quot; I think I'll just give Michael Crichton a rest. But for anyone really intrigued by the concept of nanotechnology, I would HIGHLY recommend &quot;Blood Music&quot; by Greg Bear.
0375432302|5.0|I thought this book was great!  I sat down at a girls desk at work and she was reading it and I read the first chapter and I walked down to the book store and bought it.  I didn't put it down until I ws finished.  I think it is a great read!
B0001UL7RY|3.0|This cd is ok, it grew on me after a few listens. Its definately worth checking out. I'm really just posting to &quot;A music fan from michigan,&quot; who said in his review &quot;maybe Avril isn't very good but don't fool yourself into thinking that Good charlotte is better because it makes you seem ignorant.&quot; You didn't even listen to the whole cd, so you should probably do that before responding. Also, maybe you don't like good charlotte (actually, I don't really either) But there are people who do, so just because you think it sucks doesn't mean that it does. I agree with you that people should reasearch music to find lesser known groups as there is a lot of talented people out there. But the only person who seems ignorant is you, for not awknowledging that there are other people out there who have different tastes than you do. Just because someone likes Avril and good charlotte, doesn't mean that they are ignorant and those artists don't suck just because you say so. It just means that the are individuals who have there own tastes. Sorry for the rant. But I just had to post this after reading music fan from michigan's short sight review.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|...Baby One More Time: A nice, pop album.  Upbeat, but follows the debut formula.<BR>...Oops I Did It Again: better than &quot;BOMT&quot;.  The songs are nice, her voice is nice. Her voice will never have the power to blow you away with talent, but hey, as long as it's &quot;nice&quot; you won't cringe, right?<BR>...Britney: For me, this is when she started going downhil.  The only song I liked that was released from this album was &quot;Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman&quot;.  her voice is getting worse--maybe from the smoking.<br />And now we have &quot;In the Zone&quot;.  An album filled with either over-hyped, repetitive synthesizers or ballads where Britney warbles her way through.  &quot;Toxic&quot; is catchy, but it's not impressive at any point.  Her voice-Oh, wait, you can hardly HEAR her voice through the beats and computerized tones.  &quot;ME Against the Music&quot; was just horrible.  Madonna didn't help it.  &quot;Everytime&quot; is a song that has already had dwindling top40 popularity.  Why?  With ballads, you can't hype them up.  You leave them as is; and with Britney's whiney voice, you just can't support a song.<br />All in all, skip this &quot;music&quot;.  She reminds me of *NSYNC.  I used to like them, but with each subsequent CD, the music and their voices got worse.  I don't know what it is; but Britney's voice has really gotten just horrible.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Why do all the fakes get all the attention? Why not the women who really can rock? Is the media too afraid of them? Instead we get Avril Lavigne who's so supposedly the 'antidote' to Britney Spears? Don't you people get it? Avril is NOT the antidote to Britney. She is only the GERM that spreads the disease. This is total pop music. Some may call it pop/rock but the more pop than rock. It's just sad. If you want some punk rock made by women you should try Babes In Toyland, Bikini Kill, L7, early Hole, Bratmobile, Huggy Bear, etc. These bands were around when Avril was still in elementary school! Ha! How sad that all these bands have been forgotten.
B0002234LS|5.0|After Pirates of the Carribean, I would proclaim this movie as one of the best Johnny has ever done. Johnny Depp plays Mort, a struggling writer living in the wilderness, with the nearest town a long drive away. One day, he hears a thundering boom on the door, and answers it to find himself rushing in a wildwind of fraud, a pinch of romance, mystrey, and yes, murder.<br />'Secret Window' is a shocking movie I would recommend for teens and above, at the lowest maybe a 10 year old could view it. Though a thrilling movie, some parts I even close my eyes to avoid... well... gruesomeness.<br />A highly suggested movie for those that seek suspense.
B00006RINF|5.0|I bought my tickets a month ahead of time, I even rented a car so that mine wouldn't overheat in the traffic of the sweltering city of Philadelphia, all so I could see Lacuna Coil at the Electric Factory on May 29.  Much to my dismay, they were the first band on and wouldn't you guess my luck, I arrive at 7:30pm (only 1/2 hour late) and totally missed their set! So I decided to drown my sorrows in a bottle of vodka.<br />Flash forward an hour later as I am drowning my sorrows in a bottle of vodka while at Dracula's Ball.  Can you believe my surprise when who walks by me?!?!??  Cristina, Andrea, and Chris from the band!  So of course I followed them downstairs.   Of course, I went up and said hi.  But you know what shocked me the most?  No one seemed to know who they were, and even more shocking, Chris, hung out with me the rest of the night drinking Screwdrivers and conversing in Italian, French, and English!<br />Cristina, Andrea, Chris, Criz, Maus, and Marco not only create beautiful music, but they are charming and absolutely delicious in person (DUH, they are Italian!)  Their music is sometimes moody, sometimes dark, but they are always intriguing.  Cristina's vocals are haunting, ethereal, and oftentimes spinetingling.  She can start at a low murmur and rise to a high fevered pitch effortlessly.  (You know, those notes that you cringe thinking the singer just might not hit it...) Well she does!  Her vocals are complemented by her boyfriend, Andrea.  Many times they blend together so seamlessly that it is difficult to discern who is singing.  Guitars, keyboard, and drums blend in to create the tension and mystery this band is going to be famous for. <br />Everyone seems to want to compare them to Evanescence.  They do have similar dynamics. However, each of these groups is a triumph in their own right. Evanescence is a tad more upbeat.  Lacuna Coil is a tad more dark, gothy.  Either way, both of them make great music. We should celebrate, not hate.
B0001HAHXW|2.0|Don't expect to hear amazing blues guitar, or much guitar playing of any sort, on this misleadingly titled CD.  A more descriptive title would have been &quot;Clapton sings Johnson&quot;.  What little guitar playing there is, is obscured by the piano &amp; rest of the band.  I was pretty disappointed.  Seems like Clapton has regressed back to the 70s when he rarely played on his albums.  Maybe his legend has surpassed his ability &amp; he's afraid to let us find out.
B00006RINF|4.0|While Comalies isn't my favorite album by Lacuna Coil, I could tell you that what Evanescence (or more akin to their true nature: The Amy Show with a few nameless guys) is attempting to do. Yay, good for them that can produce a psuedo-rap-rock theme. What band can't?. Lacuna Coil has what they lack: a soul to their music. No one in the Gothic Rock scene can really belt out the vocals that Christina can with tracks such as, &quot;Comailes&quot; or &quot;Swamped&quot;. While Comalies uses more synthetic sounds than I have heard in any of their previous albums, it does not negate from the fact that they are above all, very soulful musicians.
B000001FMX|5.0|In the 70's the new york dolls did a tour with two off the biggest bands ever areosmith and kiss. The only thing about this tour was that the new york dolls headlined the tour.

B0001AP12G|5.0|&quot;What the hell was that kanye?&quot; Well, what it was, it was one of the best albums of the year.

It's The ROC Hola!
B00005B36H|5.0|I want to know the webside for Tool.<BR>I have four cdand they are brilliant
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I first heard this record I thought this was the best Slipknot album ever, but to tell you the truth I was not a Slipknot fan and I didn't understand their purpose in rock music. I got so obsess with this album that I have to buy Iowa and Disasterpiece(DVD) afterwards. After watching Disasterpiece I could understand Slipknot a little more. I could not be anything but overwhelmed by this nine guys delivering the most aggressive and in your face music I ever heard, and I know there are hundreds of heavier bands, but the masks, and the fact that there are NINE guys on the stage performing their asses off is just leave eating dust any other heavy metal contender. So it made me think, &quot;Slipknot is a live band, and the material from Iowa is most enjoyable through live performances&quot;, and that was it, that was the moment when I could come with a better description of The Subliminal Verses. Slipknot first two albums were a document of the possibilities of a Slipknot live concert, raw and in your face, but if you ever play an instrument or were part of a band, it could be fatal to be playing the same thing over and over again. If Slipknot would have release another album like Iowa, the possibilities of this band breaking up were going to be higher, and the record would have turned out in just another heavy record with no purpose, a crowd pleaser, and that for me is selling out. I can understand why certain fans are pissed off but maggots have to understand the importance of a record like The Subliminal Verses. My favorite bands are Radiohead, Tool and The Cure, and from this type of musical taste you could say that a Sipknot album would never be found in my record collection, but that is the greatness of this album, now it does. If you don't like this record, maybe you should give up on Slipknot and be grateful that they released two of the most excitable heavy records in rock music history. I for one can say that I love this record and I definitely will checkout what Slipknot do next.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|People who say this album isn't hard should be slapped... HARD! This is a great album, I think Rick Ruben took them to the next level as a band. Before listening to this I thought there wasn't much else out there pushing musical bounderies other than &quot;Tool&quot;. Keep in mind all this is coming from a person who did not like Slipknot what so ever until this effort. Being a musician I can really appreciate all the layering of sound that has gone on, something that wasn't really there in Iowa and in the s/t. There is finnally a nine-piece band where nine-pieces works really well. Pick this album up if you are into rock, metal, or are just looking listen to something a little bit different. Or, if you are like me and didn't like Slipknot to begin with, you might be suprised and gain new appreciation for their work as I have.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|This is a &quot;must see&quot; Rock N Roll movie, there are not bands like this anymore. Thankfully, the movie has been fully restored,and the quality far exceeds the cinema release.<BR>Although I would have loved it if Jeff Stein could have located<BR>more concert footage or even added more of The Who's Woodstock<BR>performance.  I know for a fact that 5 songs were filmed, as I have seen them, years and years ago.

B000000H3W|5.0|The Jungle Boys, also known as Seputura have done it again with Arise. I just get a rush whenever I listen to these guys. Like Morbid Visions, Schizophrenia, and Beneath The Remains, Arise is just a pure total slamming, headbanging death/thrash metal assault that is just loaded with brutal guitar riffs, insane solos, and bobbing drums that makes you wanna thrash in your room whenever you're not in the mood for any happy ass, everything's going to be okay bullsh**. Max Cavelera's vocals get more angrier every time, and his rhythm guitarwork is just fast and superb, while lead guitarist Andreas Kisser rips out solos that are just art like. Igor Cavelera is one of the best drummers in metal, and he give out a strong performance as usual, talk about sheer brilliance. Arise, Subtraction, Desperate Cry, Murder, Dead Embryonic Cells, and the cover of Orgasmatron (originally performed by Motorhead, another one of my favorite metal bands) are the best songs. If you want to start a Sepultura album collection, I suggest you start with this album and Beneath The Remains. Happy Headbangin! The Metalbeast.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|How can anyone out there claim to be a rock fan without owning or experiencing this album. Everlong is one of the best written and produced songs, just listen to it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'm a 45 year old guy, and I can't stop listning to this CD.  Absolutly addictive. I cannot stress this enough...Buy it!
B00023BLXK|5.0|i love this retelling of the classic love story, Dirty Dancing! I especially love Diego Luna in this movie! I can tell he will be a HUGE star soon! And if you are reading this Diego, I LOVE YOU!
B000003TA4|5.0|This Cd is awesome ...right from the rattlesnake riff of Smells like Teen Spirit....it simply rocks......well i would like to say that some idiot dude said that kurt is a loser, he has no talent,road runner is better, and this album is crappy and blah blah blah well **** you we don't need your silly opinion ....everyone knows Kurt was a legend (include Rolling Stones)and this album is one of the greatest of all times...if you don't have taste for music then don't utter rubbish...you must still be listening to britney,backstreet n all...don't have taste for rock don't buy rock albums but please don't give your f***in opinion.....
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first heard tATu in early 2003 or so. I heard their first single, \\"All The Things She Said\\" on the radio, and I loved it. Then, about a half a year later, my friend got their CD and literally just raved about how awesome and addictive it was. I really wanted to hear all their other songs, so I went out and bought it. It is utterly amazing! I thought it would be good... but not this good! I kept listening to it over and over again. It is so addicting. The pop/rock sound mixed with techno influences of each song along with the unique vocal flare of Julia Volkova and Lena Katina make it incredibly addictive. Even now, months and months later, I still listen to this album practically everyday. There is much speculation as to whether or not Julia and Lena are actually lovers in their personal lives. In my opinion, it does not matter. Speaking personally as a teenage homosexual male, these lyrics are truly an accurate and honest expression of the angst, loneliness, and depression that you go through as a homosexual person. They are expressed with genuiness and honesty that no other artist has captured before. I love how poetic and respectful the lyrics are. The fact that this is being put out there for people to buy and hear is truly powerful. There are 11 tracks, but 8 of them are original, and they are as follows:<br />1.Not Ganna Get Us- Truly awesome song with a techno flare. It's about running away from society with the person you love... like a fantasty song. The only bad aspect is that it can get repetative. 4/5<br />2.All The Things She Said- Great song! It's basically expressing the general angst of being in love and no one understands your love, and it's driving you insane. Great poetic lines, and not as repetative as track 1. 5/5<br />3.Show Me Love- Has a very cool russian opening where Julia and Lena are talking on the phone. I love how this album incorporates some russian into the english songs. This song is a very upbeat dance track. It's about being lonely and wanting someone to show you love. It contains my favorite lines on the CD. When expressing why you're attracted to someone they sing that it's \\"like a game of pick-up-sticks, played by f***in' lunatics\\" Also, the only hardcore cuss word on the CD. Great Song! 5/5<br />4.30 Minutes- Very creepy! It's a ballad. There's this creepy laughter in the background that adds a very eerie feeling, especially if you're alone. It's about making decisions. wonderful song! 5/5<br />5.How Soon Is Now?- a cover of the Smith's song. I've heard both. I know I might get lacerated for this, but this version is significantly better. Probably the most rock influenced track. A truly honest expression of loneliness and needing love. Arguable my favorite. 5/5<br />6.Clowns(Can You See Me Now?)-Very techno influenced. Probably the most poetic and metaphorical lyrics. It can have 2 interpretations in my opinion. One is how ignorant people shield themselves from what they don't understand. Or, I also interpret it as an expression of wanting the object of your love to see you and that you love them, but they're so consumed with everyone around them that they can't. Can get repetative though. 4/5<br />7.Malchik Gay- It means \\"Gay Boy\\". Probably the most american sounding song. It's about being in love, but the person you love is taken. Incredibly relatable. It might get annoying to some though with the repitition. But, it's arguable one of my favorites just because of the topic and lyrics. 5/5<br />8.Stars- Truly Captivating! The girls go back and forth from verses in english to verses of russian rap. The russian sounds so awesome. I love songs in different languages, and to also have english in it is very cool. The saxophone in it provides for a very smooth melody. It's a very slow and soothing song. It's basically just about how it shouldn't have to be this hard for homosexual people in society. Great Song! 5/5<br />9.Ya sashla s uma- original russian version of \\"All The Things She Said\\"It's very cool to hear it in russian and go back and forth between this and the english version. Because the girls are singing in their native language, the passion in their vocals really stands out. Very cool to listen to. 5/5<br />10.Nas Ne Dagonjat- original russian version of \\"Not Ganna Get Us\\" Again, very cool to listen to the russian version. It makes you want to learn russian! lol. 5/5<br />11.Show Me Love(Extended Version)- This is the extended version of Show Me Love. If you like the original, you'll like this. It has a different opening that's more rock oriented. Awesome! 5/5<br />This album is truly amazing! The lyrics are very genuine and honest, and it truly expresses a soul that is tormented by the angst, depression, and loneliness that encompasses being different. It expresses the shameful shyness that homosexual people experience in their lives. The lyrics are also written in a very illusive way to where not just homosexual people, but that everyone can relate to. Regardless of whether or not Julia and Lena are actually homosexual in their personal lives, the fact that they do express it and put it out for people to hear is awesome. I encourage you to purchase this utterly amazing and expressive album. You will not be dissapointed.

B00003CXFG|4.0|On it's own, \\"Pitch Black\\" is an enticing, satisfying, gore-and-gusto horror film that is of a slightly different feather than other such Sci-Fi outings like movies about Mars, movies about aliens destroying us all, or new movies about good actors and bad directing in movies about Jedi.<br />Speaking of Jedi, put \\"Pitch Black\\" up to \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\" and suddenly \\"Pitch Black\\" looks like \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\"  Either that, or \\"Chronicles of Riddick\\" looks like \\"Phantom Menace\\"--an overload of computer special effects that stir nothing.<br />A quick recap:  Huge frigate ship crash-lands on desolate thrice-sun scorched planet, leaving ten survivors along with notorious killer Riddick stranded seemingly without help.  They wind up dancing back and forth between the prospect of dying at the hands of a murderer, or being made into a meal by noctural wraiths that screech and hoot at them from the shadows.<br />I first saw \\"Pitch Black\\" in the midst of a horror-film bender that included all of Romero, \\"Dead-Alive\\", the \\"Evil Dead's\\", \\"The Frighteners\\", \\"Dusk Til Dawn\\" etc etc etc.  I never thought that a Sci-Fi setting could figure into that sort of stylized horror-genre where the main satisfaction is in grisly demise, but \\"Pitch Black\\" pulled it off, a lot more so than \\"Event Horizon\\" tried to do a few years ealier.<br />The pivotal character, as we are all well aware of now, is \\"Richard B. Riddick, murderer, escaped con\\" as he cheerfully informs one very intimidated Paris P. Ogilvey.  This very large man (Vin Diesel) who commands one hell of a presence has two distinct gifts, well actually three.  One; his eyeballs have been wet-sanded and buffed to a showroom finish, giving him an ultra-sensitivty.  Two; he has a knack for killing nocturnal wraiths (cross between a hammer-head shark, a leopard, and a pterodactyl with a huge bloodlust).  Third; he can disappear like a mist.  What's not to love here?  The movie recognizes Riddick's immense appeal and infuses that into the character of Jack (Rhiana Griffith); a girl disguised as a boy until something very exclusive to girls gives her away.  Jack/Jackie is the survivor who most closely resembles Riddick in essence (mysterious, headstrong, hidden sensitivity) and even goes so far as to mirror his image by shaving his/her head, wearing makeshift goggles, donning his devil-may-care attitude.  Jack almost outdoes Riddick  on-screen, although not quite.<br />Cole Hauser plays a Aryan dreamboat named Johns who has a morphine addiction and is rather attached to his gun.  He hunts Riddick, with limited success.  Rhada Mitchell plays Fry, the pilot-cum-captain who never attains the strength she tries to project.<br />The best part of the movie is when it's about to take a 180-degree turn.  Everything is going just hunky-dory with the recovery plans; they find a spare ship (best bit of space-luck EVER), find that it's functional and compatible with their remaining hardware, and realize a plan to make it off the planet.  The only problem is that those man-eating wraiths come out when the sun is down, and the whole planet is about to be engulfed in an eclipse set to last forever.  Sure enough, the wraiths emerge once the suns are gone and the death ensue, but it's here that the characters really get interesting.<br />The idea that the movie would spend time with their characters, developing their weaknesses and shortcomings as opposites to Riddick is quite revealing.  Riddick becomes a measuring stick for all of us in this movie, showing how a mix of people with enigmatic backgrounds (also like Riddick) all come up short in certain categories, especially in clutch situations.  Their first sin is that they all misjudge Riddick and blame him for the death of Zeke, one of their group.  Of course Riddick didn't do it, but who cares?  They have their scapegoat, and not until a very close call do they realize their error (incidentally, Riddick is still waiting for the letter of apology from everyone on that).<br />So the movie becomes not only just about a marooned motely group on an uninhabitable planet; but about a microcosm of humanity struggling with their individual anti-heroism as they try to measure up and meet the challenge of being stranded with no recourse to the outside world.  I suppose isolation becomes one of the more important ideas the movie deals with; something that Riddick cherishes, but everyone else cannot deal with.<br />All in all, there's more to this movie that meets the eye, and I think a lot of big-name reviewers missed the point.  This movie actually brings up some complex issues such as character and identity, the morality of a microcosm, relation and disassociation, as well as the nature of good when faced with \\"good evil\\". <br />I highly recommend this movie.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is because the sumblimity and mood of a truly classic sci-fi film is missing, but I do count on this movie becoming a pulp-sci-fi classic quoted heavily by those with the disposition towards such films.  Also, there are some plotholes; such as how does a species of animal who are killed by sunlight evolve on a planet where light is abundant 24/7?  And just how in the hell does a solar eclipse last forever?  Either the moon would have to slow down, or the planet speed up, it's revolution to match speed with one another and create a lasting darkness.  We all know that objects in space in motion remain in a constant motion neither accelerating nor decelerating unless acted upon by another force.  Who knows, maybe it's the force from those Jedi far, far away...
6304602979|5.0|Won't repeat what has already been said. This is one of my favorites with unforgetable characters. This is Quetin's best script. Also, there's something about a hot blonde and a downtrodden guy who loves comic books. Enough, for guys especially, this one is a keeper.
B00005JMEW|2.0|there was only 1 good part in this movie. it was in the begining when there was a fight between 2 chicks. that was the best part of the whole movie and the only reason it gets 2 stars. without this sceen it would have no starts. the movie looked good in the trailor and previews i saw 4 it but it kept changing from black and white back 2 color then 2 japanese anime crap. i am not 1 of those ppl that hate violence but evrytime a limb was cut off blood squirted out like a fountain and it looked so fake. i own many dvds and this is my least favorite 1. i would recamend renting this 1st cause there is 1 good sceen and those of u who like japanese fighting movies would like this. otherwise dont buy it bcause it sucked
0780021967|5.0|\\"39 Steps\\" is the last of Hitchcock's British nail biters. He took his style to Hollywood after this one. All the elements of a Hitchcock thriller are here. We have the mistaken man plot. Our hero has stumbled on a den of spies. He must prove his innocence and thwart the theft of military secrets and escape Scotland Yard from London Music halls to Scottish moors. The Hitchcock blonde is Madeline Carroll and her stocking scene must have been tough for American censors. Hitchcock learned his craft from the German expressionists and you can see the darkness of that genre in this gem. In the top twenty of best movies ever made, I recommend 39 Steps.
089381525X|5.0|At first glance this book is very intimidating by size.  I was overwhelmed by the amount of photos Salgado took of his subjects, which in this book were the workers around the world.  As I flipped through each page I began to think of rather than looking at a book of a photographer's work, it seemed as if I was looking at a photo album dedicated to hard laborers. Each photo is extremely vivid and beautifully shot.  In addition, each photo gives the impression that Salgado puts thought and emotion before shooting his subjects.  This is apparent by the many angles he shot his subjects and more importantly the extreme close-up shots he had.  In many of his pictures Salgado appears to capture not just the action of the subject, but the emotion and story as well.  You can't help but sympathize for each worker.  Furthermore you start to realize how much the world depends on this type of labor in order to move forward.  In a sense, this entire book give a view into all the hard work it takes to create all the luxuries we take granted for. <br />The entire book itself is very high quality.  Each picture is printed clearly and at a large scale to show each detail of Salgado's work.  It's also neatly organized rather than photos jumbled everywhere.  Photos are separated by the location where they are shot.  Moreover, aside from the large scale photos in this book which take an entire spread, there are some fold-out pages that contain smaller photos which give it that \\"photo album\\" feel. <br />This book is evidence of how great of a photographer Sebastiao Salgado is.
B00005JLR8|5.0|I watched In America with two savvy co-eds jaded by Kill Bill movies and Hollywood special effects. So I got them to watch this movie and when it was all over they were bawling their eyes out for at least an hour. This movie is very touching. It's told with a terrific script. The minor characters are bigger than life, New York low life types, very believable. The family of Irish illegals live in a horrible ruin of an apartment because the Paddy Considine can't find work as an actor, so his wife, Samantha Morton, of the short haircut, takes up the slack by waitressing. The story is told through the eyes of the oldest sister, Christy, so we have a narrator that sees the world innocently. This gives the film a fable quality, like any of this could happen in NYC, but the viewer wants the love of family and the resolution of a family tragedy to be true. I'm going to cry.
B0001UL7RY|2.0|I needed to write this because I was sickened by all the reviews on the board.  At least if you are going to write something make it intelligent and don't say something like &quot;listen to good charlotte, new found glory, and simple plan instead&quot; because none of those bands are good either.  In fact they suck.  If you really want to hear good music listen to Ben Kweller, or Cursive, or Sunny Day real estate, death cab for cutie, travis, modest mouse, guster, or the shins.  Don't pollute yourself with stuff from the radio thats completely mainstream.  Educate yourself about music.  Do your research.  And maybe Avril isn't very good but don't fool yourself into thinking that Good charlotte is better because it makes you seem ignorant.
6304806442|2.0|Trainspotting glorifies heroin use while it gets preachy about friendships. It appears that the Scots of Braveheart have deteriorated in a socialist country. If these teens and young adults have nothing to live for in the public housing block grayness, then escaping into a heroin fog seems enticing. Alienation of youth has been with us for a while, but it seems to flourish only in relatively benign societies subsidized by social programs. Even in capitalist America, heroin is a favorite in the Urban Pockets of Social Welfare. Ewan McGregor is a fine looking young man and he has a choice,live or stick a needle. He chooses the needle. Special effects stretch the addicts bodies like rubber and there are hallucinations of a doomed baby, a fat baby for a heroin mother. Well it reminded me of those Acid Trip, movies from the 60s. Groovy Dude and the Blue Meanies are so hip, man. Trainspotting is ranked in top ten British movies ever made by some ranking services. I think David Lean would object.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|It annoys me that those of us who have decided not to buy this DVD set are being called whiners by some other reviewers.  I believe it isn't right to ask people to shell out $41.99 or more for movies that are not the ones we grew up with.  It might just be a few tweaks here and there, but to me that is not the same movie.  I refused to buy the special editions on VHS and I refuse to buy this set now.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I saw 8 ? (1963) for the first time on South Street in Philadelphia at the old TLA theatre. I was in my mid-twenties and liked the big-breasted women. Saw the movie again yesterday at the Colonial in Phoenixville, PA, a wonderfully restored small town theatre, and reentered the world of the great director Federico Fellini. The cast consisted of Marcello Mastroianni (mid life crisis of the great director), Claudia Cardinale (the perfect woman), Sandra Milo (the chesty but dim lover) and Anouk Aim?e (the ordinary wife he cheats on).For Fellini, 8 ? continued a trend away from the realism of his early movies to a surrealistic view of his own life. The film has a simple premise. The great director has no idea what his next movie is about, while his producer and film company wait for Mastroianni to tell them what the movie is about. It does not help that Mastroianni falls in love with every woman in the cast and every woman he ever knew. The famous harem scene is near the end of the movie, where all the women in his life await his every whim. The older ones get banished upstairs. When the women revolt, he gets his whip and regains order. The women love him again. Oh, irony, but in Surrealism, Freud reigns supreme and dreams are a wish. I rate 8 ? one of ten best movies ever made.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I'm probably the only person who thought this was a dull, boring, pointless, and largely unsuccessful, movie. That's because a film that is merely a grossfest of bizarre atrocities, because it needs to surpass the level of weirdness of the original movie to lure people back, but which lacks any sensible plot to tie it all together, not to mention much else in the way of redeeming aesethetic or other qualities, such as scientific accuracy, is still a dull, boring, uninteresting movie.<br />I wanted to say something more on the medical info, some of which is wildly off-base. This will require my waxing a little technical, so I apologize for that in advance, but I feel obligated to point out that several things in this movie are total nonsense.<br />I'm not a medical doctor, but my masters and doctoral work was in neurobiology, and I do know something about that, and it's highly unlikely someone would cut off their face while on poppers, if that's what Lector gave the Gary Oldman character. There wouldn't be enough anesthesia.<br />Oddly enough, there is a way this could happen, but it's a very rare neurological condition. These people lack a certain type of pain nerves. Mothers with this condition have been known to go into labor without knowing it and had the babies fall out on the kitchen floor--not good.<br />These people are born missing one of the two main neural pain pathways, known as the paleospinal-thalamic tract, or spinal lemniscus for pain. The other pain pathway we have for pain is the neospinalthalamic tract, which is for so-called epicritic pain, which are basically sharp, pinprick-type sensations, as opposed to protopathic pain, which are more dull, aching, type of pain sensations. But if I'm remembering my neurology correctly, it's the former one that's involved in this condition. But nothing in the movie suggests a connection with this strange neurological condition.<br />Well, I didn't mean to get into the technical minutia on all this, but movie-makers have a certain obligation not to desseminate crapola. I also doubt that there has ever been a case like Hannibal the Cannibal. Obviously, he's a fiction or construct, perhaps a combination of several real-life people (such as the Harvard Law School Professor, Kingsley, was in the movie, Paper Chase), but I didn't even mind that too much. The movie revolves around Hannibal's bizarre psychology, which, although they never do explain it very well, is really the only interesting thing in the entire movie, and if they didn't have him, they wouldn't even have a movie at all.<br />Finally, the scene with the hog was lifted from a much earlier Thomas Harris book from about 15 or so years ago, called Red Dragon, which is about a different character than Hannibal Lector. But I didn't even mind that too much, as the hog was probably the best actor in the movie (and I usually like Anthony Hopkins).<br />There are other things I could criticize about this movie, but as this is already a pretty long review I'll leave it at that. You might think I'm one of those hypercritical, nitpicky reviewers who love to find fault with everything, but in fact I'm actually very easily entertained when it comes to movies, and usually I'm not very uncritical of them.<br />This movie completes the parallels between the Roman Coliseum gladiatorial games and Hollywood's film output. Next thing you know we'll be having our own version of the gladiatorial games with the same events the Romans had--gladiators hacking at each other, political and religious dissidents being eaten by lions, and naked boys having to chase and catch porcupines with their bare hands.<br />If you like pointless voyeuristic grossfests almost completely lacking in any other redeeming cinematic qualities, then this movie is for you.kers have a certain obligation not to desseminate crapola.

B0001HLVSC|3.0|Shiver me timbers, boy. Har har. The trouble with these old sea tales is the lack of women. Its all about the men and boys for years, er and hour or so. Here's an excellent recreation of life at sea on wooden ships. Are the action scenes exciting or farfetched? As a yarn I guess its okay, but a little too Hollywood for my taste. Russel Crowe is certainly everybody's favorite captain or little league coach. His doctor pal is unreasonable and not much of a friend in his single minded Darwinian search for lizards and bugs while the British Empire is in danger. Anyhow, entertaining, but nothing to write home about.
078401213X|4.0|The two worst things you can do in a review are over-hype and give away the ending (especially for movies that build to the end) - here's looking at you 'The Aphasic Android' (other reviewers gave away the ending too). This movie is somewhat pretentious and suffers from some neo-classical art-house direction tricks; however these flaws fail to take much away from a truely intersting storyline. I guess this movie isn't for everyone - sort of the equivalent to listening to the Jesus and Mary Chain.
B0000DCGT0|3.0|In Sea Biscuit,the big horses are great to look at, and the photography of racing is exciting, but this tale of second chance Depression Populism falls short. It's the mean Republicans against the noble Democrats during the Great Depression. Poor people look saintly while they're starving, and we know that uncaring rich people that don't want to pay their fair share of taxes cause bad times. There's the mandatory shot of the great Franklin Roosevelt offering a helping hand, so we have a tale that blends My Horse Flicka with 1930's hard times, and we come up with a wishful fantasy history. If only Roosevelt ended the Depression with social programs and government jobs. Let's see. The Depression started approximately in 1930 and Roosevelt and the new Deal were still going strong by Pearl Harbor. Hmmm, if it had not been for a war economy, with Roosevelt's help we would still be in Depression today, but don't let reality get in the way of a feel good movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this entirely on the faith I had in Joss Whedon and company from his shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.  I love those shows and figured I'd give Firefly a shot when I saw the DVD was coming out and all the great reviews it was getting.<br />So I watch the pilot episode and I must admit that I was a bit confused.  Maybe it was the whole Western thing with spaceships, I'm not sure.  Anyway, I kept going with each episode and each one is progressively better than the prior one (at least they were upon first viewing, I don't feel that way now...the pilot was excellent upon repeat viewing.)<br />The weird thing about viewing these is this.  I got near the last few episodes and started feeling sad for everyone involved with Firefly (viewers, actors, writers, directors).  The show was so fabulous and you can tell from the commentaries that all the people involved with the show felt cheated by FOX for pulling the plug on them so quickly.  This is pretty obvious because you don't generally make movies out of TV shows that lasted only 11 episodes on the air.  They are though and I'm going to go see the movie.<br />For anyone thinking of buying this...do it!  If you are a Buffy and/or Angel fan...buy this!  It isn't the same as those shows obviously (i.e. Western, spaceships and stuff) but the writing style and the humor is there.  You'll be able to tell this show came from that same universe even without the vampires.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|A special mention here about &quot;Lost In <BR>Translation,&quot; the Sofia Coppola film that <BR>wowed critic Terry Teachout and others.  <BR>There are films that translate well on <BR>television screens, but I fear this <BR>masterpiece by the daughter of Francis <BR>Ford Coppola of &quot;Godfather&quot; fame must <BR>be seen on the big screen.  <br />Few films show a semi-familiar place, <BR>modern Tokyo, in the splash of dazzling <BR>excitement and color this film <BR>immortalizes.  The visuals would be <BR>enough to hold you for an hour and forty-<BR>five minutes.  Also, the sound track is so <BR>ultra-modern amazing; the theatre <BR>sound system changes from fantastical <BR>to whimsical scene by scene.<br />Scarlett Johansson, a pretty young <BR>blonde plays the thoughtful and lonely <BR>wife of an inattentive photographer on <BR>an assignment in Japan.  Bill Murray of <BR>comedic movies like &quot;Ground Hog Day&quot; <BR>or &quot;Caddie Shack&quot; plays a semi-serious <BR>role, a washed up TV star doing whiskey <BR>commercials for Japanese television.  <br />Unfortunately, Murray is going through a <BR>mid-life crisis and is lonely like <BR>Johansson.  Sure, they connect, but this <BR>is not the love story you might expect.  <BR>We want them to be lovers, but even for <BR>the audience there are ethical <BR>considerations.  How many movies <BR>involve the viewers with such subtlety?  I <BR>highly recommend.
6305784116|3.0|How is it that Disney movies don't seem to age? Even Snow White seems pretty normal nowadays. The Aristocats is not the best, prettiest or funniest Disney movie ever made but people who like sweet cats will enjoy the drawing of the cute little cats in this movie.<br />The drawing of the people is very realistic and the animals all have their own personality, the jazzy alley-cats are my favorites. It's about 80 minutes long so perfect for young children.
B000067J1H|2.0|Fight Club is shocking, colorful, Matrix like, full of technical magic, but it stinks. The whole idea that Corporate America stifles freedom is bogus. Most folks put in 8 hours and go home to kiss the wife and kids, smoke pot, or ride their motorcycles. In truth, human activity after 5 in America is diverse. Wasted, gray lives, that's what its like in Socialist countries. So what do these fighting young men do to combat Corporate Fascism, they kill and destroy like Nazi's. Clear thinking there, hey! Yeah, Brad Pitt is believable as a handsome, cocky, cool guy. He had to use all his talent to stretch for that role. This movie is everything that's wrong with the Left Wing Intelligentsia on the East and Left Coast.
0743243307|3.0|Other than finding it a bit of a long haul getting through Chanu's lenghty philisophical pontifications, I thought this book was generally a good read. Ali certainly has a different writing style from others and that is fine, although sometimes I feel she works a bit too hard to be different. The book did however leave an impression with me and I doubt I'll forget it anytime soon. I felt I could identify with many of Nazneen's inner struggles of faith (although mine is a strict Christian background)and morality; I think Ali portrayed these sensitively and accurately. I actually liked the way she implyed Hasina's accent in her letters, I felt as though  I could hear her speaking. I thought it added to the book's interest rather than detract from it. I am glad I chose to read it, it broadened my outlook.
B00009P1O5|5.0|This is one of Neil's best albums.  I prefer the rock side of NY's work, such as Zuma and Ragged Glory.  If your like me, and love lengthy guitar solos and distortion than you will really like this cd.  Neil was going for repitition on this album and he definately got his message across.  All the songs are awesome, but my favorite would have to be T-Bone, which has excellent guitar.  Neil shows his rocking side on this album and there are plenty of his unique solos.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I've been bored with a lot of new urban artists. It all sounds the same to me. In the middle of this big period of bordum this album was released. Features Kayne's deadly production.

B000002UAF|5.0|As Tony Barrow said, &quot;we didn't want the film to turn into a continuous parade of Beatles music, but we decided to still release the other songs that John and Paul had written.&quot; And easily, any of the tracks on this LP could have been hit singles. The CD is filled with one great tune after another.  There are absolutely no songs on here that you'll want to fast-forward.  The title song, &quot;A Hard Day's Night,&quot; along with &quot;Can't Buy me Love&quot; and &quot;If I Fell&quot; are probably the most famous of this collection, but it also includes such great songs as &quot;I'll be Back,&quot; &quot;I'll Cry Instead,&quot; and &quot;I'm Happy Just to Dance With You.&quot; The only fault I see is that George doesn't sing enough (only 1 song), but John and Paul still do an excellent job.  You would expect their first album of all-original material to be weak in spots, but it is strong all the way through. If you're a fan of the early Beatles stuff, this is THE album to buy.
B000066NW0|1.0|We don't need anymore of this crap, we have enough, if i could i would put no stars because that is what she deserves. If she had written the songs herself, then MAYBE one, but she has an annoying voice and that crap about not wanting to learn how to play the guitar correctly is crap. She needs to grow up A LOT before she can be taken seriously. She is too old to be dressing and acting like she is a 10 year old at a blink 182 concert. I agree with this &quot;uncle lester&quot; and there is much better music to listen to than this crap. You want good music? then go out to a local club and listen to the bands in your area who are struggling to make it and even bring home enough money to eat! that is REAL music... along with the greats like led zep and the beatles and metallica. this cd is NOT worth your money or time.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|This album of the infamous band has an unbelievable effect even on an &quot;experienced&quot; Slipknot listener! From this point the purpose of all the previous band work could be interpreted as a preparation for them &quot;Subliminal Verses&quot;. After issuing two great yet striving to be popular albums and showing the world that they can and will work great with live audiences, they just unleash it all on us. The thoughts, the goals, everything they have planned to express by banding together, everything just can't be ignored by our minds now we are ready to accept it.<br />This album is a masterpiece in all possible meanings of this word. It is flawless because no one has ever done nothing like that, and how can you do wrong something no one hasn't done yet? Furthermore, you can't possibly do wrong when you have been preparing your workspace so long!<br />Bravo! Now I'd like to see them top THAT!
B0000AKCLS|5.0|After recording two successful solo albums, mixing influences of classic rock and blues, Joe Bonamassa has released his first full-blooded blues album, Blues Deluxe on August 26, 2003 which marks his contribution to \\"The Year of the Blues\\". This CD is totally made up of Joe paying homage to The Blues Legends, never mind what CD is the best of 2003, this one reaches into your all time list and knowing that it was recorded in just 8 days is way to scary to even think about what this guy is capable of!    To be honest there are some great new blues/rock CD's that have come out this year, and I know of at least 3 or 4 others that I highly recommend as a must buy for 2003, but if you don't buy Joe Bonamassa's new CD, I promise you will live to regret it! After the first spin of this disc I was totally speechless, a total loss of words! I don't even know where to start describing the overwhelming sense of AWE that came over me, I mean the hair on the back of my neck literally stood on end about half way through the title cut Blues Deluxe! I knew this cat was good but is it really possible that he has gotten that much better? Damn right he has! From this day forth anytime the name Joe Bonamassa is spoken it should be followed immediately by these two words \\"GUITAR GOD\\" because they only people I have ever heard play like this is Jimmy Page, Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. I have heard people flirt with music like this and become \\"GUITAR GREATS\\" but to just flat out kick it in the ass like this not only puts this cat in the category of the elite, but cements his place in guitar history! It's so very exciting to witness greatness like this in the making! Joe Bonamassa has perfect control over his instrument, it's like he will's it to speak to you without any effort at all.    High points on this disc are the front and back cover, and everything in between! There isn't a week spot on the whole disc. Some of my favorites are the B.B. King cover \\"You Upset Me Baby\\", the title track which was wrote by Rod Stewart \\"Blues Deluxe\\", \\"Woke Up Dreaming\\" which features Joe's amazing speed on acoustic guitar, the T-Bone Walker-inspired \\"Long Distance Blues\\" and the Freddie King cover of \\"Pack It Up\\"! Also \\"Wild About You Baby\\" is some great smokin' slide stuff. Bonamassa is a great musician and showman if you miss the chance to see Joe live then you will be left in the dark at what this guy is all about, his guitar work is beyond words you must experience him in person, I truly believe that Joe Bonamassa is the future of the Blues!!!    Bonamassa has secured his place in Blues History. Phenomenal Masterpiece!    Reviewed by The Bandit  [...]
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I was skeptical of this movie after reading some short plot summaries. But I am glad I checked it out because it is a great movie. Don't be fooled by all the time travel/giant bunny talk; this isn't a big time science fiction film. Those are just occurring events in the plot, that's not what the movie itself is about. I would relate it closely to The Butterfly Effect in terms of the idea of the movie. If you could change things in your life in order to protect those around you, even if it meant maybe never having some of the beautiful memories, would you do it? Jake Gyllenhall does a great job at being creepy and yet sensitive and loving, like most teenagers. It's a haunting movie and may stick with you a while. The reason I only gave it four stars is that I thought the plot could have been a little tighter; the premise is great and the resulting movie is as well, but there were moments when a little more could have been added to really put this film over the top.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|this cd is great the guitars are crazy as well as the drums its slipknots heavier side you can hear every single instrument its just great corey isn't swearing constantly which is a nice change and mick and jim are just tearin it up joey continues his crazy drumming as he has through all 3 cd's its just plain metal the way people like it
B0001NBMBC|4.0|okay. i reviewed this album once already but i've had some time to think about it. i'm not coming at it from the angle of the new found slipknot fan that thinks the oldsters are ungrateful for calling the knot sellouts. or the old school maggots that complain the band has gone soft. i'll look at it from both angles. on the first hand, the album over all is quite impressive musically. there's some very nice motorip going around on a few of the tracks and it definitely grows on you overall after the first, let's say three listens. while it does demonstrate maturity that the band has stopped swearing, it's probably a shock to some people because that was sort of a slipknot staple. i will say this in the defense of the new school fans, all shock bands lose their shock and sparkle after a while. either they realize you eventually lose your shock when people become desensitized, or you just decide that you become a gimmick after awhile, i think that could have prompted slipknot to stop attempting to shock us all. on this side, the side of the long time slipknot maggot, you have to say that the band definitely went in a completely different direction...but, there is a but. after three years it's almost naive to assume slipknot would sound the same. none of us expected them to sound this different, but i knew they wouldn't sound like they did on Iowa, they've grown, i think. In reference to the band themselves, i will say that one thing that disappointed me lyrically was corey taylor almost bragging that he was the new kurt cobain for a while, using phrases like 'if you just listen to me i'll go away', that annoyed me, because the banner of voice of generations is usually one that the holder doesn't embrace or acts like they don't realize they have. it's a sign of commercialization, i suppose. at any rate, all of the oldsters like me who were raised on slipknoit and moved on to death metal and hardcore cannot logically complain that a nu-metal album sounds polished and commercial, otherwise the album wouldn't be nu-metal, it'd be something else. saying that you still love them makes you a real maggot is just mindless teen garbage. i mean, when metallica released st. anger how many people said that they were real fans because the album didn't suck? now even metallica them selves are apologizing in interviews for subjecting people to their newest effort. if the band regrets to direction they took, we'll find out soon enough. and if the old slipknot will make a comeback, we'll all be there, saying we knew it was coming. at any rate, those of us who were older fans back when the band wore orange and played garages still have the past to reminisce and the new kids on the block will get just as caught up in the craze as we used to, it's the circle of life. if you don't like the new album, you've still got their three old ones, and even some of the ep stuff they did with Revelation Records. Me personally, I'm not willing toi just write off a band that played such a huge part in my adolescence and who i turned out to be as a music fan. i can say thank you to the knot for leading me in the direction of hardcore, and i can say thank you for helping me make the transition from rap to metal in general. i might not necessary like the direction the band is taking, but i've got the past. nostalgia is a powerful thing, people. new slipknot fans: just make a promise to me and the other oldsters that you'll get as much out of the knot and 'the great big mouth' as we used to, that's all i ask. that having been said...new schoolers, here's a line from the past: 'how does it feel to be the new abortion, the only generation that's up for extortion?'
B000031XCR|1.0|When I first heard the song, &quot;Power of Love,&quot; it sounded like she was being stabbed. And after listening to a few more Celine Dion songs, I wish I was the one being stabbed. Just because you can screech a song through the hills doesn't mean it's pleasant to the ear. I am certain that if Celine Dion were on the Titanic performing, passengers would be jumping off the ship far earlier than when the ship hit the iceberg. I wish amazon.com would let me put negative stars for this review.
B00006879E|4.0|When I first heard &quot;This Love&quot;, I thought it was Mick Hucknall of Simply Red singing it and having a 1989 flashback.  I later got the album and I love it! It's been in my head for several weeks now!  This band plays like they mean it!  It does have that late-'80s  R&amp;B/rock feel and a lot of funk in the songs, but it's very now, very today. I'm surprised it came out in June 2002.  How come nobody checked it out then and waited until Harder in late 2003 or This Love in April 2004 to jump onto it so rapidly?  Right now, Maroon 5 is a hot group and they have the talent, the drive, and the chance to be a very successful band. Liked the lead singer's falsetto too. Buy this album now--it will not get out of your head for a long time!!!!
B00004TFK3|4.0|I like this movie because it has a a lot of good scenes where you laugh, the situations are ludicrous just like the aliens. And what about the screen where you can see Steven Spielberg, Sylvester Stallone or Oprah like aliens? And it's full of irony besides good special effects. If you want to have a good time buy this one. By the way, has anybody realized that the green baby alien, that Will Smith has in his arms, has the same face as Jedi Knight Kit Fisto?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why the late review?  Why bother? There are at this writing 957 reviews of this DVD set, and the overall rating is still at 5 stars.  I was going to write one back when there were reviews only in the double digits.  But, I don't think I have to.  Nearly one thousand people have.  Look at some of your other favorite shows...how many reviews written?  Most people don't bother writing reviews, and if you take a gander at the...ahem, 950 something reviews you will find that if there was ever any doubt that you should own this show, it should be taken out, beaten by the people who canned this show and then both flown into the sea.<br />Like most people who love this show have done , once I showed a few episodes to people...they became hooked...and then apprehensive (They CANCELLED THIS?!!BUT WHY! why??)...then bought the show for themselves.<br />Yes, it's from Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy The Vampire Slayer, and Angel.  Yes, it is as good as, dare I even say at times...better than those in it's infancy of only a handful of episodes before Fox pulled the plug ( Foolish...absolutely foolish).  Every actor in this show shines, and knows their part(and with a main cast of NINE, they better)...they come together like this show has been running for a couple years already.  Though the show did get cancelled, many of you already know that the crew of Serenity will fly again as a major motion picture.  Perhaps the show will live on in the movies as a success, playing the reverse of Buffy (unsuccessful movie turned amazing TV show).  If things are going the way they are, I'm positive it will.<br />In short, don't bother asking.  Buy it. Watch it. Love it. Curse Fox for cancelling it. Praise the fact there will be movies. Then tell a friend.
B00006JK1R|1.0|Somebody said that second parts weren't good as the first one. I think that0s true because this one it's bad, it's not as good as the first one, the situations here are boring, they aren't funny. The rythm goes up and down all the movie and plenty of CGI. Not to mention the bad performance of Lara Flynn Boyle and Jonny Knoxville. I had stop watching the movie because I was very bored. <br />One word: abominable
B000267JQK|1.0|When seether first came out with their first album Disclaimer back in 2002, i was hooked to this band. All of the songs are great tracks. I have been listening to them at least once a week sicne i bought the album. But when they pretty much re-released their album here with 8 additional tracks here, i wasnt quick to go to the store and buy it. When you think about it, most of the new tracks on this record have already been released on sound tracks and such, so most of them i already have, and other people probably already have. I dont feel like people will buy this record when they have songs suck as Hang On, Broken with Amy Lee, etc. But then again, this record does come with a DVD which i havent seen which can be very good. <br />Out of all of the New Tracks i would have to say Got It Made, is by far the best track from the 8. Also, the track Save Me i thought was a great song. With Broken with Amy Lee, i thought it was over done. Maybe not alot of people agree with me, but i think that the original Broken is better then this version.<br />If you want to go out and buy the disc do it, especially if you are new to the band. But if your like me, find a site and download the new songs, and maybe a friend of yours bought the disc with the DVD and watch it then.
B00005JL78|1.0|The movie it's very claustrophobic, with all that technology and commercial messages. Nothing seems to be normal in the one, those flashbacks of the son of Tom in the movie, the doctor operating him. And the fight in the car factory it's almost the same as in the &quot;Star Wars: Episode 2&quot;.<br />Yack!
B00001U0E1|5.0|Although Geoffrey Rush is not the star of the film, he delivers a memorable performance, as usual. Fiennes does, also.  The costuming is very beautiful, and the humour is delightful.  Highly reccommended.
B00005ATQD|3.0|I like Stanley Kubrick he was a magnificent director, he knew hos to create mystery in the stories he directed, sometimes scary and sometimes very slow. He was a versatile director, he could direct any kind of movies, that shows how good he was. But, I can't qualify this movie, it's like one of those strange dreams you have and looks so real, and you don't know if it is real or not. Tom Cruise gets into an &quot;underworld&quot; of people with strange hobbies, like undressing women in a sort of church; he gets in things that he shouldn't know he0s curiosity is big. And Nicole Kidman looks so cold. And the music sometimes it's annoying. And why the movies in full screen edition and not in widescreen?<br />Watch this movie at your own risk.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Definately will keep you on the edge of your seat!  Scenes realistic, acting superbly done, costuming impressive, also.  A very fine job by Mr.Weir and all actors in the film.  Definately one of Crowe's best performances .
B00001ZWTT|3.0|This is one of those movies that make you laugh and have a good time, of course the plot it's bad, and the situations in the movie are absurd. But you can have a good time with the clowninngs that Will Smith and Kivin Cline make. And Kenneth Brannagh looks impressive with just half body.
B0000027FQ|4.0|This live compilation represents Accept at the top of their game. Recorded after the release of the studio album Metal Heart, the line up was: Udo on vocals, fantastic Wolf Hoffmann and Jorg Fisher on guitars, Peter Baltes on bass and Stefan Kauffmann drumming. It has a nice choice of songs and and enormous amount of energy. Also, all the songs are played slightly different from the stuido versions.<br />ACCEPT was one of those mysteries of the music industry: why such a band did not get the success their talent deserved, and things like Britney Spears get all the money?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|The Fog of War is undoubtedly a smartly done documentary. Those who touted that Michael Moore's Bowling for Columbine as a great documentary would find themselves speechless in comparison. Regardless whether in the end, the viewer sees McNamara uses this film to spin for himself, or McNamara trying to make an honest and forthcoming look at the events, one must agree that the music score, the splicing style of war footage and the interview style, and the integration of so many elements make it an unforgettable piece.<BR>McNamara had came a bit out of his shell for the making of this documentary. He has discussed many topics that he previously were reluctant to discuss, while in the end, you'll see that he's still reluctant to discuss some other topics. The Tokyo firebombing, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam war, and the lessons that he learnt are at least worthy of a look by the cynics. I personally think that he's trying to tell what he sees as truth, and the fact, or at least notion, that he did not pushed the president into war is well demonstrated by two voice recordings, one with JFK, and the other with LBJ. His mistake concerning the Vietnam war was deferring to the president, and not exercise as much critical thinking as he has with Ford. The fact that deferring to the president is still a concern, and ordinary citizens, when asked in person by the president, would most likely serve as asked. This doesn't mean that he is not guilty. The images of a human IBM machine by some, and the narrow minded technocrat by Noam Chomsky are shattered and replaced by an emotional human being affected by both WWII and Vietnam, and a man who at least attempted to understand the problem, regardless whether he's an executive in Ford or the Secretary of Defence.<BR>His Vietnam memoir, In Retrospect, would serve as a supplement to understand this mysterious figure.<BR>For those who still hold contempt and cynical at what McNamara had said and done, they should have a look atthis DVD. It would give them a different slice at the man that has shaped and affect millions of family in the Cold War Era.

B000000XB9|5.0|Credence Clearwater revival is now part of a living legend.<br />His innovative pieces were loaded with deep conviction , and above all commitment .<br />They created a sound based in the beat , and not in the virtuosity aspect . If they made Proud Mary as the most known theme , they translated to Lodi , a summer song or the rock and roll themes like Fortunate son or Travelling band , or well they turned to incredible pieces such as Born on the Payou or the ballad Have you ever seen the rain? They knew how to engage every different market target , and that was the secret of their sucess .<br />In this age one wonders in silent voice how they are missed and why are not there bands actually with such creativity and beating sound ? .<br />An unforgettable style that will never let you dissapointed. Buy this one.<br />A must in your private collection.
158799190X|5.0|Taleb offers us an original yet lucid analysis on the too many theories that prevail on just about every topic.  While a large part of his book covers financial probabilities, Taleb's contention - that success is mostly based on luck, as opposed to convoluted theories and analyses  -- is applicable to a wide array of subject matters, and Taleb illustrates his point with a variety of engaging examples.  It is a welcomed analysis, particularly in light of the fact that businesspeople are increasingly accused of competing for attention with predictions often based on not-so-sound premises.  An excellent writer, Taleb is opinionated and witty.  He manages to be thought provoking and entertaining at the same time.

B00005NTJK|5.0|For starters, I'm not crazy about remasters of original releases, especially with new tracks. I mean, the original is the original. If I wanted an extension, I'd buy a &quot;best of&quot; and be really happy. But still...<br />Imagine 1970, a house on a lake in the woods with nothing to do for a day. My true introduction to Tull was in Columbia, MO. &quot;Stand Up&quot; was an eye opener. But &quot;Benefit&quot;? That's where the house on the lake comes in. Nothing to do but listen to Benefit over and over and over and so on. Remember, it was 1970, the house was in New Hampshire and everybody I knew was on some sort of jag. Ten tracks of angst, anger and re-or-un requited romance. all set to the edged voice and whispering like thunder flute of Ian Anderson, bash-about drums of Clive Bunker, the strong bass rythym of Martin Barrre and the co-lead-work of Mick Abrams. After 18 hours straight, these guys were inside my head.<br />For openers, &quot;With You There To Help Me&quot; plaintively weaves the story of someone who's just about had it. The saving grace is you, probably. The lyrics are cleverly twisted while the melodies segue through a plodding set up and end the song with joyful whispers.<br />&quot;Inside&quot; is a marvelous desription of relationships and the comforts of home, while &quot;Son&quot; is a true teen tirade. &quot;To Cry You a Song&quot; sums up the regrets for the night before.<br />The seven remaining cuts are just a strong. The album closes with &quot;Sossity, You're a Woman&quot; is the tenderest of &quot;its not me, its you&quot; breakup tunes.<br />All in all, this is one of my most loved recordings. Too bad the &quot;new age&quot; re-releasers of this gem had to add the bonus tracks.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Sam Mendes made his masterpiece to date following carefully the path of golden directors . Think in Billy Wilder to be exact.<br />Watch for the opening sequence. The camera is a butterfly who sets us in perspective with the voice in off introducing us to the center of the drama.<br />In this sense I inmediatly reminded Sunset Boulevard , but this secret homagge to that giant film is not a sin.<br />The script is amazing. It bretahes and allows laughing situations with Spacey and about him , beside the awful emotional crossroad he lives.<br />Andre Maurois told once : There's an age dramatic for the man , in which he is capable to raise the passion in a woman but not satisfying her *.<br />And this idea is involved in this film . Rapture images as the famous roses bed and the face of the teenager Angela Hayes (Mena Suwari) who plays the role of femme fatale , superb performance of Anette Bening and above all , the development of the secondary drama of the troubled officer , makes this film as the best dramatic film in many years ; and that means a great hope for those film makers who seem think that the special effects are fundamental in every film.<br />And this film is the best proof to deny that false premise!

0688163173|1.0|More heavy handedness from Lehane. It is both predictable and unoriginal. Rings untrue. A violent mental patient left to wander unobstructed, injuring guards, injuring patients as part of his treatment. Come on? Follows the pattern of every schizo book or movie ever in print. Remember Fight Club. Setting it on an Island in the 50s does not make it fresh.
B000127LW2|4.0|I have never been a watcher of star trek episodes, but Voyager really caught my attention... but it was later in the series so i missed out on the beginning. I enjoy these dvd's because I am now caught up on what I missed, and its nice to see how a show has grown and improved over the years.  Nothing starts out perfect, but I find it very enjoyable and I look forward to the rest of the series on DVD.

B000002OX7|5.0|The Art of a Live Show<br /> A beat pulsating through your veins, emotion to overwhelm you, and the experience of being near a god; live shows were once rocks main attraction and an event that could alter your perception of the world. Before there were cds, mp3s or music videos, there were concerts, records, and at most a television appearance or two. Claims that looks weren't such a value at one time in comparison to current times is a misguided judgment,  of course rock stars still needed a \\"look\\", but at a certain point in the crowd you tend not to be able to see too much of a performer. Rock and roll used to be an industry of good music, now it is an industry of moment.<br /> Live shows are not just occurrences they are life. When you attend a concert there is an aura that surrounds you. Based on the band that you see an aura can change, it is not just a \\"feeling\\", it is a state of being. A rock concert of the highest quality is enlightenment. Effects of body, mind and soul occur at once as you let the music absorb you. Body's crash together in a frenzy of good feeling, your mind is phased by experiences past and present and true meaning. Your soul is clarified and set free, for a moment you are immortal, coexisting with your soul as an object, almost tangible.<br /> Cds and mp3s are all about convenience and efficiency. Cheap, readily available and mass produced music is not hard to acquire. Digital technology allows there to be \\"improved\\" sound quality and added features and sounds. Records were a pure and poor replacement for concerts when one was in need of some tunes. Records were exactly what were played, by the exact artists who claimed the music as theirs. Every sound was picked up, every imperfection that creates the perfection of sound records have achieved.<br /> From a distance in the crowd you see the outline of a rock god, you can not make out every last feature, but he omits this aura of good looks. From your couch only feet away from your television screen you see the blemish on the face of a \\"wannabe\\" vocalist, you are turned off. The closer we are to seeing rock gods the more prone to judging them and characterizing any flaws that they have. Between one and a screen there is no transfer on energy, there is no aura, a sense of being barely exists as technology advances on our looks.<br /> Rock, music, and life were once all about \\"it\\", now we are left for, \\"what can we have now, that is the bet of everything\\". In all imperfection is perfection and in all people judgment occurs based on different standards. Rock and roll used to be an industry of good music, now it is an industry of moment.
B0001DI0FI|2.0|The movie has no more plot than a cat and mouse sequence that never ends.  In the parts where I wished the movie would slow down, it went too fast.  In the parts where I wished the movie would speed up, it went too slow.<br />If you're looking for an intellectually stimulating film, steer clear of Master and Commander.  It's a cat and mouse chase that lacks creativity.  I thought the chase scenes in the Matrix were long, but compared to Master and Commander, Matrix's sequences are short and deep.  Master and Commander is only a thriller, there is nothing epic about it.
B0001XWV12|1.0|This movie was so stupid I turned it off after seeing that girl in the hot tub take off her top, that was rediculous, no girl is that stupid.  This movie makes all women look like brainless idiots when in fact the people that make these movies that make women look stupid are the brainless idiots!!
B0001AP12G|3.0|I have to say that I was a little dissapointed with West's first debut album.  There are some standout tracks...but the album seems to be laced with stand up comedy samples and songs about fraternity/sorority houses.  Not exactly what I look for in a Jay Z protege.
B0001ZX0OW|3.0|Grim and gripping melodrama sucks viewers in to sordid tale of three blue-collar Boston playmates brought together again as adults by a tragedy. Opening sequence is very distasteful but the story settles down as the police probe into a murder swings into high gear. Acting is uniformly great and Director Clint Eastwood has an ocean of emotion to work from. The final resolution though, seems unlikely and why did the Massachusettes FBI, and not the City Police work on this case?
B00008K7AM|5.0|I know this movie isn't exactly life-changing and it doesn't attack any real *issues* in the world, but if you're looking for a fun comedy that will have you laughing so hard you're practically crying, The Hot Chick is it.<br />Age plays a huge factor for the audience - I'd recommend it to teenagers and people in their 20's, but anyone much older or younger will probably find it repulsive or confusing.<br />The basic storyline is that Jessica, this stereotypical popular girl, accidentally switches bodies with a disgusting man (played Rob Schneider).  She overcomes a gazillion challenges while trying to get her body back and Rob Schneider should really be commended for his acting.  Sure, this sort of character isn't going through any extreme mental drama, but it isn't as if normal teenage girls act just like her, either.  Every nuance of over-superficiality is purposely there to make the audience laugh, and I can honestly say I was rolling on the floor with by the end of the movie (whether it be the first time I watched it or the tenth).<br />While almost every scene contained something hilarious, my favorite was when Rob Schneider and three other girls were having a pillow fight and s/he doesn't know her/his own strength and ends up practically throwing the other girls in the walls and knocking them out.  Whoever was Anna Faris' stunt double did a fantastic job.<br />Overall, it's just a fun, happy romance/drama/comedy/action/etc. that deals with a wide variety of teenage issues, from accepting one's culture (as seen in Ling-ling, one of the girls in Jessica's clique) to parental marriage trouble.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I've been an Iron Maiden fan for as long as I can remember, and I have to say that this is quite possibly the best work they've ever done!  <br />I saw them live for the first time in San Diego on the Give Me Ed...Till I'm Dead Tour, and was completely blown away.  I mean I've heard them live on their live CD's, but to actually experience them live in the flesh was unbelievable!!  And not even six months later, my wife and I saw them agian in LA for the tour in support of this album.<br />It's obvious on this CD that any animosity that may have been in the band after Bruce Dickinson's departure and triumphant return to the band is water under the bridge.  Everyone in the band is on the same page, and are dedicated to give their fans of almost 30 years exactly what they paid for.<br />From the infamous Niko McBrain's count off to start Wildest Dreams to the final cords on Journeyman, it's a good solid real metal album.  <br />Although all of the songs great, the songs that really stick with me are No More Lies, Dance of Death, New Frontier, Pachendale, Rainmaker, and Face in the Sand.  Bruce's vocals are off the charts, the three guitar assult of Dave Murry, Adrian Smith, and Janick Geres will beat you into submission, no one is wilder behind the drums than Niko McBrain, and the Matermind and bassist of the outfit, Steve Harris, proves that a band like this only gets better with age. This album can be compared to other classic Maiden albums like Number of the Beast, Powerslave, Killers, and Fear of the Dark. <br />Everyone talks about how great the music scene is now, but I just don't get it.  All these so-called great acts to me are only interested in generating hits for airplay on either the radio or MTV.  I want to see if they are still around in 30, 20, or even 10 years from now, because I think there's a shelf life to these bands.  When you have bands like Iron Maiden, KISS, Slayer, and Judas Priest, they're not still around because they're generating hits on MTV.  They're still around because they care about their fans, and they know that without the fans, they wouldn't be here today.  Not like Metallica who sold-out to get their precious little grammy.<br />OK, enough of my rambling.  I've gone off the subject here.  To sum up the CD:  Great Band, Great Songs, Great Musicianship, and most importantly of all, Great Fans!!!  Up the Irons!!!!
B00028HBKC|5.0|I saw the Passion of the Christ several months ago when it was first released in theaters, however it's message of unconditional love and selfless sacrifice remain indelibly etched in my mind. As any who have caught wind of the film well know, it is visually, the most graphic depiction of Christ's final hours ever conceived. Unlike many others though, I feel as though the its graphic nature only acts as a catalyst to enhance the viwer's grasp of the magnitude of the sacrifice Christ made to absolve us of our sins. Granted, it may be too violnet for others, especially those who are used to the archetypical, bloodless version of Christ's crucifixion, which we've become so accustomed to from movies past. My best advice to those who are debating on whether or not they're willing to see it, is that Christian or not, everyone can benefit positively from what this film has to say.
B00003CXRM|1.0|I bought this movie on DVD cause of George Clooney. I'm very disappointed in what I watched. I stopped it after watching an hr of it. It put my bestfriend to sleep and almost put me to sleep. The story is way to slow with no plot. The acting sucks. The talking scenes are boring and way too long. There is nothing funny about this movie except for the fact that people actually like it. Which I find surprising. The movie is suppose to be about a trio on chain gang who break from prison is 1930's. They are out on the run to treasure. Along the way, they come across many strange people. Who are way too stupid with very low talent or talent. Which makes this movie very unworthy to watch. I give this movie a 3 out of 10.<br />I'm a HUGE George Clooney fan. I've liked him since seeing him in Return To Horror High in 1987. Just because I don't like this movie, does not mean I'm not a true Clooney fan. A fan does not have to like everything about the person they are a fan of. If there other fans out there who don't like this movie. Please come forward.<br />If you want to see a good George Clooney movie. Then watch The Perfect Storm, From Dusk Til Dawn, Ocean's 11, Out Of Sight or The Peacemaker.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I must say at the outset that I am a TOTAL Coen Brothers fan and have seen ALL of their projects.  This ranks right up there as one of their crowning achievements.<br />This is a re-telling of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer and after viewing this, I finally got a handle on just what the &quot;Odyssey&quot; was about.  In a nutshell, it follows the exploits of a man and the exotic characters he meets along his journey.  The way the Coen Brothers personified such stalwart literary characters as the Cyclops (John Goodman) and the Furies is most creative.<br />Excellent performances all around from the likes of George Clooney (in one of his most endearing roles), the incomparable John Goodman, Holly Hunter, John Turturo, Charles Durning and a wonderfully strong supporting cast.<br />However, one cannot mention the merits of this movie without a mention of the soundtrack.  It is most obvious that the Coen Brothers invested an enormous amount of research to make sure that the music adequately accompnaied the mood and tone.  A wonderfully indelible example is the use of an acapella song (that utilizes no words, only moans) still used in African-American churches that is beautifully realized.<br />The music in this project is positively spellbinding, regardless of your particular musical preferences - there is something here for everybody.  The soundtrack deserved the kudos it received.<br />This one you will enjoy over and over and over again!!!!<br />Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexcellent!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril really kicks it up on this brand new album. I love it. I really loved the song &quot;Forgotten&quot; because i can really relate to it. &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; is also a powerful song. I hope Avril keeps up the fantabulous work!
B00005JKNC|3.0|A decent feel-good light drama about the good and bad of what Hollywood gives to America, and the games the power people play freely with the lives of others.<br />The Majestic is also a marvelous depiction of a small town, and a realization of just how much we have give up in the name of progress. The entire cast is simply wonderful in this regard.<br />As a romance, it does not astound. Laurie Holden is never particularly convincing in her character despite great support from Papa Stiers, so the director wisely lets the true romance be between Carrey and the town, with Holden reduced to suitable window dressing.<br />From a pacing standpoint, I think we spent too much time watching Carrey feel out the town before he mistakenly accepted his new identity enough to put his heart and soul into rebuilding the Majestic -- a nostalgic valentine well-deserving to be the American equivalent of Cinema Paradiso.<br />In sum, the movie is not for the hard-edged or the misanthropic (they are welcome to watch Requiem For A Dream or Traffic again if they wish) but you want a light pastime for two hours and some short change, you can do a lot worse than The Majestic.
0553573403|5.0|This book single handedly renewed my faith in the fantasy genre and showed that there are still new things that can be done with the medium.<br />If you have grown weary of the story of a farmboy/farmgirl with hidden magical powers and a secret lineage who travels across the land with his/her trusty band of sterotype heroes to do battle with the minions of some evil lord hereby saving the world, then by all means get this book and read it!<br />If, on the other hand, that type of plot device is what you crave and you can't get enough of the virtuous warrior or reluctant mage and his gruff dwarf and cutesy halfling buddies, then stay away from Game of Thrones - there is none of that in here.  As one reviewer put it, &quot;Where are the heroes?&quot; - thankfully far away!!<br />What is here are characters who blur the line between good and evil, completely unforeseen plot twist, realistic motivations and consequences, political intrigue and a setting that comes to life.<br />I have always taking a liking to the non-traditional fantasy and those stories whose central figures are anti-heroes or those on a path of redemption.  This book in many ways reminds of what I liked best about authors such as Moorcock, Gemmell and Leiber.<br />If, like me, you seek some non-traditional fantasy of a truly epic proportion that goes light on the elves, dwarves and knights in shining armor then you too will probably love this book!
B00005O5CM|4.0|The film doesn't relent in tired cliches from frame 1, but Witherspoon is perfect in the title role, and has enough vivacity, earnestness, and timing to make the film seem better than it is. Don't expect guffaws but there are some fairly enjoyable comedic moments and the film rolls along well unto its predictable finish. Decent rental.
B00005AWMF|4.0|THE BEST OF SADE gives an overall earshot of the bands hit discogoraphy.SINCE I ALREADY at the time of this release owned all of the albums this cd offers a chance to hear glimpses of each recording and that is what makes this offering appealing,<BR> in the sense that you get the compact feel of the band instead of the full on touch.HOT SUMMER DAYS COOL CRISP AUTUMN EVENINGS.       true quiet solitude or to share intimately.IF YOU ARE A NEWBIE AND CAUTIOUS TO PICK ONE OF THE MANY CHOICES FROM THIS BAND HERE IS A SOLID, FLUID STARTING POINT.
B00003CWTI|1.0|What would happen if you took the seven worst movies by the seven best actors in hollywood and crammed it all into one 3+ hour long movie? Well, watch Magnolia to find out. This movie is that bad. Its like watching Ishtar end to end -- twice -- in one sitting. Not even famous actors like William H Macy or Tom Cruise could have saved this one. Now if you liked Ishtar or root canals or hitting yourself in the thumb with a hammer repeatedly, you should watch this movie. You have been warned.
B000051VWW|5.0|ACOUSTIC, LUSH, DECIDEDLY SPARSE AND BEAUTIFUL. SADE never disappoints especially here on LOVERS ROCK.The countryish opener of &quot;by you side&quot; which uses hope as its core, remember hope is an agent in this world of dismay and hunger for tenderness and truth;JUST as sure as the album opens with that sheer hope it closes with the same joy and openess. Each of SADE recordings shine and shift, but here there is a distinct sound. a change to a more cohesive nod to reggae gentle and perfect in delivery and content. IT IS POWERFUL in its vuneralbilty.SADE IS JUST SO COMPLETE AND TRUE. THIS BAND IS CONSISTENT. A MUST FOR THE MASSES. BEYOND WORDS.BRAVO.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|Marillion is one of the few band around that keep songs 6-7 minute long and still sound great! Especially &quot;Angelina and &quot;Neverland&quot;. It's a mystery why this group is not backed by a major record company...
B000089RVX|4.0|i like this cd...but only the tracks they DONT play on the radio because the ones they do get way overplayed and i get sick of hearing them. i dont understand why the media has to ruin good bands by over playing them. i have a feeling thats what is going to happen to evanescence.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Will Ferrell is the funniest guy out now maybe ever n this movie is the best one hes been in so far.  If u like will ferrell than why wouldn't you like this???IDK....i can't wait for this dvd it's been a long time since i've seen a movie and i haven't seen a movie as funny as Elf since i've seen Elf.
B0001Z53AQ|2.0|It's great to see that Eminem holds it down for the guys he came up with, especially since they are holding him back and lack serious talent. Now there are a few funny tracks (Em's verse of `Get My Gun') and D12 does what it didn't do on its debut release: get serious. And when they do the Dirty Dozen actually produces pretty solid tracks with `How Come' and `Good Die Young'. However, Eminem is barely featured on the CD (unlike `Devil's Night') and that leaves the other five members to struggle their way through a full-length album. Though members like Proof and Kuniva have some talent on the mic, the CD is a disappointment and D12 continues to prove to be filler for hardcore Eminem fans. <br />(2/5 mics)
B00008J4P5|2.0|this album puts me to sleep. all right you got a formula great how about some songwriting, although I do like that button song.bottom line if the white stripes really are the de rigeur of modern rock how come all them songs sound the same, and how come that dude wants to be a bad-ass dandy?what is a bad-ass dandy? who took all my stolen candy.(15 second guitar solo)man these things just write themselves
B0000029GA|5.0|'Illmatic' is simply put, one of the best hip hop albums ever. What it lacks in length, 'Illmatic' makes up for it in supreme quality. On every track Nas's lyrical prowess is evident. The first two tracks, 'N.Y. State of Mind' and 'Life's a Bitch', are two of the best hip hop songs ever. AZ, a very underrated MC, might even outshine the great Nas on 'Life's a Bitch'. The lyricism, word play, flow, rhyme schemes, creativity, production, and the rhyme structure of this CD are all perfect. This CD was way ahead of its time and instantly solidified Nas as one of the game's greatest. Sadly, I never felt the same raw magic from a Nas CD, even from the highly acclaimed 'Stillmatic'. If you have not heard this CD then you definitely do not know anything about rap. This is one of the albums that started it all, and is in the ranks of 'Ready to Die', 'Enter the Wu (36 Chambers)', and 'Me Against the World' as one of the greatest hip hop CDs ever. <br />(5/5 mics)
B00005JKC3|3.0|The movie was good, although I was let down; it was not as good, as I thought it would be from all the previews that we were bombarded with before the release.<br />Eric Bana, is a good {Aussie} actor, and definitely a new face in town, so to speak.

B00005JM0B|4.0|I have enjoyed the &quot;Terminator&quot; movies; although this one was a slight let down; the character of &quot;John Connor&quot; had gone from being a tough guy in &quot;T2&quot; to be a loser type in &quot;Rise of the Machines&quot;.<br />Overall though, it was a good movie, and you have to wonder, will there be another &quot;Terminator&quot; movie ??
B00004T9UF|5.0|One of the most controversial CDs of the last ten years, `The Marshall Mathers LP' is Eminem's sophmore release with Aftermath Music. Love him or hate him, you can't deny that this guy is one of the best lyrcists of all time. His rhyme schemes and structures are so advanced that even Rakim is probably pressing the rewind button to hear what he says again. This is a direct response to the criticism to the (not so controversial in my opinion) `The Slim Shady LP' that labeled Eminem as a hate monger, a mysogonist, and a homophobe. He fully embraces the persona with the aid of his alter-ego Slim Shady and takes it farther than any of his detractors could have imagined, brilliantly. This is one of the best `f*** you' records out there and is truly artful if you look at it right. The production is average, the lyricism is amazing, and almost every track (except `Under the Influence' which features D12) is good. Em's best work to date which he probably will never top. <br />(4.5/5 mics)
B00008EYA5|3.0|Fast paced, and entertaining; this was a good movie; although some parts were predictable.

B00005JM02|5.0|This was a great movie !!!<br />It is the perfect show for the family; the effects were fantastic; although, us Aussies, really don't have an accent !!!<br />Definitely a great addition to your DVD library; and I would not be surprised to learn, that anyone who had a saltwater fish tank, now has a new member - Nemo :)
158799190X|5.0|Taleb's clever and readable account of the realities of trading, compensation, as well as the limitations of the knowledge and rational behavior is pure genius.  A must read for anyone in the trading world.
B00005JMEW|1.0|This movie, was just horrible; I hated it, and if l could give it below one star, l would, in a heart beat.<br />I can not see how anybody could like it, but it would seem people do - perhaps they were under the influence when watching it !!!
6305603847|5.0|This is a great movie if you watch it a couple of times to understand it. There is a plot to the movie and it takes a brain to understand it. Anything thats made by Pink Floyd takes in depth thinking to fully understand. This movie is way more in depth than just a kids dad dying when he was young. Theres the whole theme of hate with the hammers theres color themes that change throughout the movie and I could name off a whole list of things. If you only have 1 or 2 Pink Floyd CDs and you dont know literally anything about the band or its history then dont buy this movie, but if your a big Pink Floyd fan this is definetly a must.
B0001ZX0PG|4.0|This movie was pretty good :) and for once, fairly close to the book :); Would make a nice addition to your DVD library :)
B00006DEFA|5.0|This movie has, since its theatrical release, been my all around favorite movie. And that's not bad, considering I was *5-years old!!* when the film came out in theatres and I first saw it. The director's cut still seems a bit foreign, because I have nearly the whole movie memorised, each scene, musical piece and dialogue, and I'm just not used to the new bits.<BR>But, even so, the director's cut is downright brilliant! Whether the &quot;original&quot; release or the &quot;special edition&quot;, this movie is ingenious and masterful.<BR>There isn't a flaw in this film. Ok, it's not a biography, but it never pretended to be. This is the life of Mozart as seen through the mad, jealous eyes of Salieri. Usually, huge historic deviances annoy the heck out of me, but in this case, they're all acceptable, and no one minds them a bit, thanks to a FABULOUS screenplay, tremendous acting and brilliant directing.<BR>Everyone is perfectly cast, whether originally designed for the role or no. I'm SO glad Meg Tilly wasn't cast as Constanze, as was originally planned for. She would have ruined the film. All the actors in this movie were perfect, so thank Fate for how it ended up!<BR>We are able to immediately feel appropriate emotions for all the characters involved - distrust of, and yet pity for Salieri, distrust of Dir. Rosenberg, love for Mozart, admiration for the shrewd Constranze, and love for the somewhat simple-seeming Emperor Joseph, God love him.<BR>Fabulous music performances by the incomparable Neville Martin. Great commentary by Milos Forman and Peter Shaffer. And a great making of that gives you all the odds and ends and trials of making this magnificent film.<BR>A jewel of a film. My all-time favorite forever.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|Aussie, Aussie, Aussie !!!<br />Russell Crowe did a great job; l loved the movie, although at times, l tended to feel slightly seasick; the cast were terrific.
B000002KET|5.0|National Acrobat is one of the best Sabbath songs ever! Great riff. The boys took some chances on this album and in most cases they work! But beware this is not typical Sabbath...very melodic but it still rocks!!
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Leave it to a bunch of &quot;Maggots&quot; to rate this cd 1 star. You guys have got to be kidding me. &quot;It sounds like Stone Sour!&quot; Oh my, Corey is singing? He's never ever done that before (Wait and Bleed anyone?) I can't even comprehend the fact that somebody could honestly think this is soft, has no screaming, weak drumming, and has weak guitar work. Track 5 has some of the best guitar work this band has ever had. Do you ever hear solos like that on the radio, hipocrites? Just because some of the songs are a little bit slower, doesn't mean their not heavy. &quot;Welcome&quot; could possibly be one of their heaviest to date. The drumming, is in fact amazing. This is a real band. While I was a fan of the first two, neither of those can hold a candle to this. You all hate rap and all new incarnations of music, but love the hip-hop flavored s/t, hate Stone Sour but think &quot;Duality&quot; is the best song off Vol. 3. And you call Slipknot crazy? Sounds like someone heard an acoustic guitar and was afraid some kid wearing JNCO jeans with a purple bullcut wasn't going to think you were cool anymore. Give it a few spins, and it gets 1000 times more enjoyable.
0440237688|5.0|I recently read this book for my middle school library college class and was completely engrossed!  In high school my favorite book that the school made us read was 1984 and The Giver was very similiar.<br />I remember when this book came out and I saw the cover and thought it was a \\"boys book.\\"  I didn't know what the big fuss was about and didn't want to read a book about an old man.  I wish that I had looked past the cover and read then because I LOVED this book.
B000002UAO|1.0|Every time I see this CD sitting on my shelf I pick it up, look at the song list, then put it back. Even Magical Mystery Tour has better songs.
B000002GVZ|4.0|This collection features 10 of Carly Simon's previously released recordings from her self-titled debut,ANTICIPATION,NO SECRETS,PLAYING POSSUM and HOTCAKES. Anybody who purchased Carly's first five albums before this one will not need this. The best song is YOU'RE SO VAIN. That one features Rolling Stone Mick Jagger on background vocals. Also the song was recycled for a song on Janet Jackson's ALL FOR YOU album. MOCKINGBIRD is pretty cool. That's a duet between Carly and James Taylor who was her husband at the time of recording(1974). I like NIGHT OWL,THE RIGHT THING TO DO and (WE HAVE)NO SECRETS,from 1972's NO SECRETS. From Carly's self-titled debut are THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS SHOULD BE. The title track from ANTICIPATION,Carly's 2nd album,was featured in several Heinz ketchup commercials. ATTITUDE DANCING from PLAYING POSSUM is quite awesome also. Carole King and Andrew Gold sing background vocals on that one. The other songs are good. After this album,Carly recorded her BOYS IN THE TREES album,her last on the Elektra label. Since recording BITT,Carly went to Warner Bros.,Epic and Arista.
B00008H2LB|5.0|there is one word to sum up linkin park<br />        LEGEND
B0000024YL|4.0|On this compilation,Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel give their fans their very best,of course. It was released in 1972,the same year as Simon's self-titled solo debut. MRS. ROBINSON from the 1967 movie &quot;The Graduate&quot;,was just one of a handful of their #1 hits. THE BOXER from 1969's BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER lacks a verse later heard,surprisingly on THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL PARK. The title track from BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER is cool. THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE is not the original recording from WEDNESDAY MORNING 3 AM,S&amp;G's 1964 debut. This version has added percussion,as heard on the 1966 album,SOUNDS OF SILENCE. SCARBOROUGH FAIR is a nice,easy listening piece. HOMEWARD BOUND and FOR EMILY,WHEREVER I MAY FIND HER were recorded live. Also from SOUNDS OF SILENCE is I AM A ROCK. AMERICA is a nice piece. I wonder if that inspired the three-guitarist band of the same name. All the other songs are good. Most songs on this album were recorded for THE CONCERT IN CENTRAL PARK in 1981. S&amp;G split before the release of this album and Garfunkel also went out on his own.

B00005UKE0|5.0|Intending to be specific, to the point, on this review, it is necessary to say that this majestic statement rose to unparalleled heights in the industry charts upon it's release. It has only solidified this standing of excellence in the years since the world of popular music began the spiral downward to the depths that permeate the music charts of today.  It is highly possible that this record is the best entry posted by any of the former Beatles after their breakup in 1970.<br /><br />The musicians that assisted Harrison were among the finest at that time, ...and although some have passed on like Harrison, many are still at the pinnicle of performance today.<br /><br />The individual songs include a number of classic tunes that will live forever in the annals of classic music, but my favorite is \\"The Art of Dying\\", within which Eric Clapton literally blazes away thoughout with a riff that requires a technique that only someone like he is/was able to fire with his fender weaponry.  The lyric is, like all of Harrison's serious material, introspective, yet can be relevant to any listener when applied to the one's personal prospective.  Harrison always had something to say with his music, and he was never timid with his words.<br /><br />I adore \\"Cloud Nine\\", and it too, is great.  But, ATMP was the most iconic album of the immediate Post-Beatle period, and until \\"Band on the Run\\" and the \\"Imagine\\" albums were released, \\"All Things Must Pass\\" was the most successful statement by any of the four former band members.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|The only reason that I do not rate this version of Das Boot with a 5 is the bad quality of the extra 100 minutes. While the rest of the movie is crisp, clear and clean, the added parts (which are mostly external shots) have not been restored, and you get scratches, grain and a thin blue line from the top of the screen to its bottom.<BR>I seriously contemplated giving this version a 3, but the story is excellent, Petersen is in top form, the performances are stellar and the added bits enhance what was already a superb war movie (even with the problems).<BR>Do yourself a favour, even if you already own a version of it, buy this - simply the best submarine movie ever made.
0792844882|4.0|I get a huge kick out of people who bash movies like &quot;Showgirls&quot; and &quot;Poison Ivy&quot; for being &quot;inappropriate&quot; or for in any way taking these movies at all seriously.  People that do are hypocrites.  They want to be cultured snobs but are too lazy to read books so they demand and expect movies and television shows to provide that intellectual stimulation, and are aghast when it doesn't work out that way.  Get over yourselves. Movies are made for entertainment, &quot;escapism&quot; if you will, not to be some big life-changing thing.  Just enjoy this movie for its campiness and delightful ridiculousness, and for the fact that Gina Gershon and Elizabeth Berkley are perpetually naked, and therefore, burning hot.
B000063DI9|3.0|This album is OK in my book, but some songs lack the energy used in all past Iron Maiden albums. Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son has some great songs but lacks energy and power.<br />Moonchild: 2/5 - OK, I really can't stand this song for some reason, but that's just my opinion. The music really saved this song's ass.<br />Infinite Dreams: 5/5 - The first of very few great songs is a soft-heavy song with many tempo changes. The lyrics really amazed me after a disappointing opener. This song is a sure fire fan favourite.<br />Can I Play With Madness: 5/5 - Finally, a progressive classic from the album. The chorus here is outstanding, and the music really mixes great with the rythems. This song also has a beautiful instrumental section around the midway.<br />The Evil That Men Do: 4.9/5 - Oh My! I believe this the hit off the album, it really brightens the album. Great guitars! I just don't think this song has the same energy used in the past two songs. But what the hell, this song is a must-hear by all Iron Maiden fans.<br />Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son: 5/5 - The first time Iron Maiden created a song over 9 minutes from their own ideas. A very heavy, melodic and awesome track. A long song with one heck of a chorus and the best vocals(I think)on the whole CD. Also the music matches the chorus perfectly, in fact, it matches the chorus exactlly.<br />The Prophecy: 4.5/5 - Alright, this song rocks but it doesn't seem to amaze me except in few sections of the song. Give it a shot!<br />The Clairvoyant: 5/5 - Nice bass! This song is freakin' awesome, I can't figure out why some people don't like this song so much. I personally would buy this album(if I ever loose my current copy) just for this song and the 5/5 marked tracks.<br />Only The Good Die Young: 4/5 - Strange title! An average rating song with fine music and great chorus, but it just seems to be recorded at the last second. What I'm saying is that this track seems rushed. It's still good though.<br />Rare tracks from this era:<BR>Black Bart Blues: 5/5 - A classic song turned into a masterpiece! Has a great chorus. Download!<br />Massacre: ?/5 - Sorry! Can't find this track.<br />Prowler '88: 5/5 - Supreme remake of the original with Bruce on the vocals and Guitar Synthesizers. No difference except the sound. Should have replaced Moonchild on the CD.<br />Charlotte The Harlot: 5/5 - Another remake of a classic, includes the energy I always talk about - the feel, the style, the sound and the precussion beats - and really would've fitted the album instead of Only The Good Die Young.<br />Lineup:<BR>Steve Harris - Bass Guitar<BR>Dave Murray - Guitar<BR>Adrian Smith - Guitar<BR>Bruce Dickinson - Vocals<BR>Nicko McBrain - Drums<br />Overall: A good album but requires the two rare tracks I mentioned to replace the two crappy(not exactly)tracks to become a masterpiece, even though it's a classic album. Give it a chance, you just may be interested in some of the songs.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|I don't know where comparisons to The Strokes are coming from?  First of all at least you can understand Franz's vocals instead of the steady incoherant mumbling coming from The Strokes.  In addition The Strokes could not create an original drum beat or bass line fill to save their lives, at least Franz has some solid musicanship.  There are some hits and misses but the good songs outweight the bad making this an overall solid album. I recommend listening to Jacqueline, Take Me Out, The Dark Of The Matinaee, Darts Of Pleasure and 40ft.  (I would give this a 3.5 but amazon doesn't let you)
B000063DHL|5.0|It's very smart of Iron Maiden to start changing their music's sound because the old Heavy Metal style would probably make some people think &quot;these guys are old&quot;. Fortunatly for you Maiden fans who loved the old sound, you probably already know, but Iron Maiden have returned to their Heavy Metal sound. Anyway this great album is more progressive than heavy, and also begins the use of synthesizers, but it's still cool.<br />Caught Somewhere In Time: 5/5 - The title-track opens the album with a melodic instrumental beginning, a very cool one I might add. Soon the song would be blasting your poor stereo to death with an unexpected shock-wave of fast-paced music. The chorus is also very interesting since not many people enjoy it. A must-listen-to opener.<br />Wasted Years: 5/5 - The first track I actually heard from this album was my favourite. It begins with a pretty good solo before turning progressive, also includes a very catchy rythem. I'm glad this song was a single because I'm sure that many people would argue that this song was extremely underated. A great song, deserves to be on this album.<br />Sea Of Madness: 5/5 - Why, why, why wasn't this song a single? It's one of the best on the album, has a great chorus and I can imagine what a video of this song would be like. This is perhaps the heaviest song on the album, the intro is spectacular and I don't think I've heard Nicko give the drums such a brutal beating, but that seems to be a good thing. The solo and acoustic sounds through the midway on this song are awesome. Bruce sings the chorus beautifully, and I finally hear a rough bass from Steve.<br />Heaven Can Wait: 3.7/5 - Pretty good track, has everything a song should have, including a lousy chorus. I'm serious, I really don't like the chorus! Thank god it has a great midway and cool solos.<br />The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner: 4.9/5 - Perhaps Iron Maiden's only song with a really long title, an excellent track with an awesome intro, Imean just hear it! The sound is the best sound than can be used for an intro. I only knocked off 0.1 points because I couldn't understand the lyrics.<br />Stranger In A Strange Land: 5/5 - The first great bass intro I've heard since the album Killers. A very interesting song with awesome lyrics. The only unmarked flow is that it's not too long because with a solo and rythem to a song like this, the song should be a bit longer than 6 minutes. Still, this is a must-hear by any Iron Maiden follower.<br />Deja Vu: 5/5 - Another cool intro but I think I should give my comments on the whole song, so here we go: WOW! WOW! WOW! Maybe the 5th best song on the album and might deserve higher.<BR>The music rocked my innocent stereo out almost immediately like dropping a hot potato on your reproductive system(no offense!). If you haven't heard it, I demand that you either get the album or download the song, it's worth it.<br />Alexander The Great: 5/5 - Take some time to appreciate the intro(music, not words), cool beginning solo, almost made me<BR>cry(honestly), but The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner has the better solo intro.<BR>This song is over 8 minutes long, the longest track on the album followed by the 7+ minutes title-track. The song tells just about everything you really need to know about Alexander, except I don't think I heard any thing about his death throughout the song. Still, this song is more worthy than the entire album itself! Hear this song or wasted your chances of of being an ex-Maiden loser.<br />Rare tracks from this era:<BR>Reach Out: 5/5 - Great, solid B-Side. Could've been on the album if their weren't many long songs. Download!<br />The Sheriff Of Huddersfield: 5/5 - Amazing track, very comedic when the Sheriff(I think)talks about how strong and dangerous he is. Must be heard by fans only.<br />That Girl: 5/5 - I really love this song, it has some of the best guitar, bass and drum work ever! This really made feel more desperate for my girlfriend's saftey.<br />Juanita: 4/5 - Weird title for a strange track. Not an excellent track because of the way it's sung, but the chorus and music save it from crapiness.<br />Lineup:<BR>Steve Harris - Bass Guitar<BR>Nicko McBrain - Drums<BR>Adrian Smith - Guitar<BR>Dave Murray - Guitar<BR>Bruce Dickinson - Vocals<br />Overall: Awesome album, deserves a chance to be one of Iron Maiden's top 5 albums of all-time. Also the rare tracks should have been included because they're all great, including Juanita.<BR>GO! GO! GO get this album if ya ain't ownin' it because I couldn't find it and I ended up downloading every song on this album.

1582432678|2.0|Although this was an extremely well written book, I just could not like the protagonist, Eva Khatchadourian at all. She remains cold and indifferent to her son Kevin who was born on April 11, 1983. Her treatment of Kevin was deplorable.<br /><br />Problems with Kevin are evident from the start. He insists on wearing diapers until he is six; he willfully destroys property and has no attachments to any object or person. He does not play with toys and shows no interest in initiating interactions. Why this child was not in therapy remains a mystery to me. After all, Eva could afford it.<br /><br />Eva's long suffering husband Franklin tries to take logic where it had never been with Eva. He chided her for blaming Kevin for everything that went wrong in their home and in Kevin's class; he rightfully challenged her by saying, \\"Kevin doesn't play right, meaning the way YOU did. He doesn't treat the toys YOU make him like museum pieces. He doesn't pat YOU on the back every time he learns to spell a new word.\\" Way to go, Franklin! I thought he was right.<br /><br />I did not like Eva or her teaching methods, which I found vain and self serving. I also thought it served her right that Kevin learned to read and count and add in secret without her. Her comment about \\"never being treated to a 'Eureka!' moment\\" of witnessing the child learn something she taught sounded very self serving indeed. I also felt it served her right when Kevin destroyed and disposed of her handmade toys. All of her efforts hollered, \\"Look at how good I am. I make an effort by making him toys. I try to teach him basic skills and it turns out he already knew them.\\" It was all about her and Kevin, as Franklin rightfully pointed out never once entered in. Her efforts were really for herself and not for Kevin.<br /><br />There were several discrepancies in the book. One journal entry dated November 8, 2000 was heralded as \\"one year and eight months to the day\\" after Kevin's final acts of cruelty when in fact it was \\"one year and seven months to the day.\\" Early in the book, Eva calls Franklin \\"Jim\\" and that was never explained. Eva breaks Kevin's right arm in July of 1989 after he went on a major soiling campaign and a few pages later, Kevin, still cast-bound catches a ball with his \\"good right hand.\\" That was the one she broke! I thought it was disgraceful that she was never held accountable for breaking her son's arm.<br /><br />Another mistake was about Luke Woodham, the boy who killed his own mother prior to going on a shooting ramapage at his high school in 1997.  Woodham had a female dog named Sparkle whom he tortured to death.  In this book, Sparkle was misidentified as \\"Sparky\\" and was referred to as a male dog.  That was inaccurate.<br /><br />Several things bothered me, including Kevin's covering for Eva when she broke his arm. When he is rushed to the hospital, he insists that Eva wait outside for him. I have never heard of any hospital that would treat a child without a parent or other responsible adult being present. I never understood why Eva, upset with Kevin for allegedly enticing a kindergarten classmate to scratch her eczema encrusted skin never questioned him or the other child directly. I was also baffled as to why the teacher did not question both children about what Kevin was whispering to the other child before she scratched herself. Why Franklin, understandably upset with Eva for accusing Kevin of \\"seducing\\" and \\"enticing\\" the other child into scratching herself never asked Kevin about the incident sounded equally remiss to me. At that time, Kevin was a child in kindergarten, not Svengali! I think Eva was a singularly atrocious parent.  She also impressed me as a phony, wanting to \\"walk briskly and talk in low adult tones\\" and \\"play grown up\\" in her new study.  Eva was all brisk, military metaphors and was a completely unlikable character.<br /><br />Since Kevin did not enjoy having down time and Eva admitted that he needed to have his minutes regimented, why not enroll him in a summer camp program?  That would have at least been an effort at helping him develop social skills and would have provided him with a routine.<br /><br />I also didn't understand why neither parent asked local sitters why they refused to watch Kevin a second time or ask the neighborhood mothers why they created a play group deliberately excluding Kevin.<br /><br />When Kevin's sister Celia was born on June 14, 1991, he stepped up his malicious behavior. He ties her to her booster seat and forces her to eat inedible concoctions; he binds and gags her in a game of \\"kidnapping.\\" Celia was foolish, clingy and fatuously docile to a fault. Eva even contradicts herself by saying that stupid Celia was \\"not an outright masochist\\" upon finding Celia victimized by Kevin's idea of \\"playing.\\"  Celia sure sounded masochistic to me!  Why neither parent protected her more is anybody's good guess.  Eva, never at a loss for military metaphors equates Celia to \\"a trusting young girl as a military ally\\" is \\"worse than useless.\\"<br /><br />Eva does some remarkably stupid things like buying Celia an elephant shrew for Christmas.  She admits that she bought the pet \\"as much for herself\\" as her silly daughter and that she knew \\"an unhappy ending for the animal was inevitable.\\"  Why buy that foolish girl an exotic pet in the first place?  Why not buy her a turtle which at least has much more durability!<br /><br />Celia was a literary foil in that her character was the polar opposite of Kevin's.  That sounded very calculated and contrived to me.<br /><br />When Kevin allegedly puts Celia's eye out in February of 1998, I could not understand why Eva would leave her in the same house with Kevin. I thought that was the height of dangerous negligence.  Although I didn't like Celia, I also didn't like Eva's low expectations for the child; \\"Celia was a doormat\\" and one who could count on being exploited by the world at large.  Franklin admittedly did not, as Eva pointed out \\"think Celia was very smart\\" which was understandable.  Celia was racked with a multitude of irrational fears, including the sight of mildew on a shower curtain or moldy yogurt.  Her masochism was just too contrived.  Celia was not an appealing character and it was easy to see why Franklin was annoyed with her and Kevin all but dismissed her.<br /><br /> Kevin's twisted pathology culminates in devastating acts of cruelty and violence on April 8, 1999. One can only wonder what forces shaped and created Kevin.program?  That would have at least been an effort at helping him develop social skills and would have provided him with a routine.

B0001O3YD0|5.0|Oh, the joy that is Pitch Black.  It starts out in space, with a voice-over by Vin Diesel.  All you know about him is that he's a criminal being transported.  Suddenly, the confusion starts...the ship is being hit by something, and a crash landing is necessary.  The first huge moral dilema is presented within the first four or five minutes of the film.  It is brilliant because it sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  Cole Hauser plays Johns, the man in charge of transporting Riddick...he's concerned only about his payday.  There's Jack, the young boy running away from something, and Imam and his students/proteges, on a trip to New Mecca.<br />The fun really begins when they finally find some water...and realize they're not alone on the planet.  The planet goes dark for the first time in 22 years, and the creatures come out for some feeding.  Survivors start getting picked off one by one, internal debates heat up, and you really wonder what Riddick will do...or even Johns, for that matter.  I love movies where there's no clear-cut &quot;hero&quot; character.  We all have our flaws, and they are all on display in this movie.<br />The DVD presentation is fantastic.  The picture and sound quality are top-notch.  There's not as much behind-the-scenes stuff as you might want, but this movie was made years ago on a small, $20 million budget.  The best special feature is the commentary by Twohy, Cole Hauser, and Vin Diesel.  They give a lot of cool insights into the film, discuss what they think worked and didn't work, and what they tried to add to the film.  I highly recommend this DVD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Shure, I saw the original trilogy, but I only watched them once.  Then, when I got to see the SE's, I was wowed.  So, for me, These films are the Star Wars that I grew up with.  So, why don't you all (original onlys) just accept this edition for what it is, because what it is isn't a bad thing at all.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|I bought this CD because I think Eminem is an amazing lyricist, but for some reason I really don't like the sound of his voice.  I thought this CD would be great because he was collaborating with other artists.  The CD was not bad, but defintely not great.  There are a few excellent songs on here like How Come, 40 oz, Bitch and American Psycho.  However, there are a few bad songs and I thought the skits were really stupid.  This CD is worth listening to, but I would buy something else with my money.
B00008EYA5|2.0|Poor Colin Farrell ... I thought this actor was a little more picky with his role choices, being quite the controversial celebrity.  The poor actors in this film tried to work with the dialogue given, but this movie left no mark, emotional nor intellectual on me.  Someone mentions S.W.A.T. and I think \\"I haven't seen that.  Oh yeah, I have, but I don't even remember what happened in it\\", because I totally zoned out.  This is not good.  There was quite a bit of character development, but this went nowhere, because in the end nothing was really concluded properly.  (Probably a sequel is on its way).  I have never seen the 70s television show, but would definitely not watch it after seeing this movie.  Talk about boring.  Action gets boring when there's no proper character and romantic development to go along with it.  This movie was disappointing, to say the least, and Colin Farrell was immemorable as a sexy S.W.A.T. member.
B000094HMU|3.0|Placido Domingo is undoubtadably a very fine singer, musician and actor. The sets are magnificant, and as a visual it is great. However, musically there are many flaws, and this has much to do with Domingo's difficulty with the role. He may have warmth and spinto in the tone to match the heroicism of the role, but he can't sing the high tessitura, making a mess of the top C at the end of In questa reggia, and producing very narrow tone in many of the other difficult notes in the score. His last A crowning Nessun Dorma is ordinary to say the least. Maybe my fellow reviewers are getting misled by some wonderfully meaningful hand and arm gestures, but what about the singing?<BR>  The version from the Vienna state Opera, with Jose Carreras and Eva Marton from 1983, is from a period when Carreras could sing. His performance is everything that Domingo's isn't and most of all is technically secure (ie he can sing the role with  Nessun Dorma much more convincing with a slower tempo and much better legato). Eva Marton is also better in this production rarely producing squalling above the stave as she does in the Met production. Maazel and the VPO in the pit are also better in many aspects. If you can get a copy of this on VHS, it is the real definitive version of Turandot and hopefully someone will see the sense in releasing it on DVD soon.
B00006AG5N|5.0|this is one of the finest compilations of elvis with 31 great songs available one affordable disc and featuring songs like love me tender and hound dog.very highly recommended.
0736041850|5.0|This is a great book.  It's not an overall workout guide; rather, it gives detailed information on a wide variety of weight exercises, with beautiful anatomical illustrations that show exactly what parts of what muscles are involved in each one.  If you're lifting weights and you want to really know what you're doing, this is an absolutely essential reference.
B00006AG5N|5.0|wow what a compilation.you get 31 terrific songs on one terrific cd from this great rock n roll singer containing hound dog.i recommend this awesome cd to everyone.
B00006AFUR|5.0|One day I heard a video playing on tv.  It was so different from the usual Green Day knock-off bands you hear so much now.  I only caught the last minute of the song but I didn't catch their name.  I kept thinking \\"boy, that singer sure looks like that pretty-boy, Jared Leto, but it can't be!\\"  I finally caught the video again months later, then got the CD.  <br />Good music for me gives you de ja vu, but yet sounds like nothing else.  Theme-wise, it seems to be about rebirth, beginnings, and ends.  Musically, it combines guitar and synthesizers nicely (like Orgy does opposed to how some 80s metal did!).  It creates a majestic feel (not apocalyptic or doomy feel).  <br />It's quite interesting just trying to describe it. I wavered between a 4 and 5.  The first two tracks alone got a 5 with me.  I don't always subtract points for the use of cliches.  Cliches are cliches because often they are simply true.  For this being their first piece of work, they show excellent potential for evolution.  It got a 5 in the end because it took me to a new place, and that's all I'm searching for in my music.
B000007492|5.0|this is absolutely a musical delight.each and every song on this great cd is a gem and i give this terrific cd my highest possible recommendations and rating.a must in every rock fans collection.
B0002234LS|5.0|Yes, I admit, I love Johnny Depp, and a self proclaimed \\"Deppist\\". When I heard that this movie was made from a book I had to read the book, just to see what happened in the end. I have one thing to say, Johnny Depp was absolutely incredible in this part. Nobody else could have played Mort as well. When I read this book, all I could see was Johnny as Mort. Nobody else could keep an audience glued to the screen just because they were sleeping, which he did about 60% of the movie. But Johnny brought enough sex appeal, quirk, idiosynchrasies, and humor into this part that anyone else would have ruined this fragile character. Interestingly enough, Mort dies in the end of the book, so I was pleasantly surprised when he lived. The creation of this story was superbly written and expertly directed. And for those who appreciate quirky-funny-done-a-million-times-before-but-so-needed movies, then this is the movie for you. Once you appreciate the fact that there are only so many ways to tell one story and that by now movies are going to seem like the \\"i've already seen this\\" but with different actors, then you will finally be able to appreciate the talent that these actors bring to these characters. Definitely a two thumbs up movie.

1587990717|5.0|Whatever proclivities one might have about Taleb's ideas, ultimately he's correct.  Sometimes truth hurts, and in many instances it kills the uninformed investor/trader/portfolio manager.<br />The guy is colorful, but he's right.
B00008CLOA|5.0|after reading the last reviewers remarks on this album i was forced to share my opinion. as one reviewer once wrote of Dark Side of the Moon right after it appeared, it is the sound of the human heart bleeding. sonically, it is pleasing and wonderful. the saxophone and vocal solos on Great Gig in the Sky are simply beautiful. intellectually, it is profound and a shockingly unique commentary on the modern human condition. there is much more than meets the eye, and it even rocks hard with solos on Money and Us and Them. and even if that doesn't persuade you, ironically you can turn to the status quo for support. it holds the longest record for any continuously high selling album ever. even if you so strongly desire to categorize and slice up the history of music into cute genres like classic rock and make trite discourse on things like &quot;progression,&quot; with Money switching between 7/8 and 4/4 time and numerous experimental sound effects, not to mention a flawlessly produced concept album from end to end, you're on thin ice to not pay them their due. this album is exceptional, and to any one who doesn't recognize that, i have hope for the day when you're wise enough to bite your lip and swallow your words.
B000002H33|5.0|Nowadays, I'm more of a Megadeth/Iron Maiden fan, I use to be a metallica nut back then when I first got into them. However, this album still is my top 5 fav album of all time even after I listen to it 7000 times. The title track is the best metal song ever. Let me break it down song by song. <br />Battery - 9.5/10<BR>Beautiful intro, and then comes the kick ass thrash, one of the best solo ever, and concluding with heart pouding drum, courtesy of Mr.Lars Ulrich.<br />Master of Puppets - 100/10<BR>Need I say more? Best metal song ever. Immortal intro, godly chorus, the most beautiful instrumental interlude, concludes with few killing riffs and an evil laughter.<br />The Thing That Should Not Be - 9/10<BR>One of the HEAVIEST song back then, even today. Influenced tons of doom/goth metal band. The only con here is the slow chrus. <br />Sanitarium - 9/10<BR>This is the most weird and soothing intro I've ever heard. Over all an excellent ballad, but it's no Fade to Black. And it's a bit repetitive, but it's still really excellent. <br />Disposable Hero - 10/10<BR>Wow, what can I say? The intro drum beat proves Lars actually CAN play double drum. The most thrashy song ever, and the lyric makes you wonder about war, and how cruel it actually is. <br />Leper Messiah - 9/10<BR>I don't know why people hate this song. Ok, so this is the weaker track, but still is really really awesome. The heavy riff and the chorus make nu-metal seem like utter crap than they already are. And the theme of the song is true to the core, TV Evangelist = greedy f**ks who only wants $. <br />Orion - 10/10<BR>One of the best metal instrumental, and certain is metallica's best. The interlude bass solo of Cliff Burton (RIP) is one of the best bass solo I've ever heard. <br />Damage Inc - 10/10<BR>Again, very underrated. This is actually one of the thrashest and heaviest metal song of all time, the solo is A+, the drum and the riff goes together so well. I actually like this song more than battery. <br />There you have it, the best metal CD of all time. If you're a metalhead and doesn't own this album, go throw away all your metal cds. It's like telling people you like grunge but you do not own Nevermind.
B000092Q4U|4.0|This is just really good (American even!  How suprising that we know what real metal can sound like!) heavy metal.
B00000IL1K|5.0|Yes, the angelic and fragile voice of Ms. Brightman is one of a kind, and she's doing contemporary music a great service by recording some really fine, unique tunes, in a new pop/classical hybrid. To call her sound &quot;kitsch&quot; is surely an unfair criticism, since Sarah and her collaborators have recorded some of the finest pop CD's ever, and she is especially good, considering the huge amount of true junk is out there. This album does not have the drive and orchestral brilliance of the earlier &quot;Time to Say Goodbye&quot;, but is still a near-masterpiece. Listen to &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;, a very underrated pop masterpiece, redone here by Sarah. Indeed, though not perfect, it's tough to find anyone around today with such a high quality of finely done tunes as the divine Sarah!
B0001MDP3G|5.0|(...)It was wonderfully acted and shot beautifully and kidman, zellweger, Law, and Natalie Portman do an excellent job in this VERY EPIC movie.  And from the looks of the dvd, its going to have some sweet special features.  <br />If you like movies see this...if you hate movies, go watch Daddy Day Care or The Friday after Next.
0790742780|4.0|Here's the story of a simple man (played very well by Michael Douglas) who's life is crumbling around him.   He's been layed-off for months now from the Defense Industry, a job he loved so much that he had his license plate personalized with the letters &quot;D FENS&quot;.  His marraige is over.  He's been reduced to living with his mother, and is too ashamed to tell anyone that he's unemployed.  He's been looking for work elsewhere but is &quot;no longer economically viable&quot;, as you'll find out.<br />He snaps and leaves his car sitting in a traffic jam on one of L.A.'s freeways.  In the next 8hrs he goes from being a transparent man to a heavily-armed, camoflage-wearing vigilante who deals a heavy hand to anyone who gets in his way.  And in the streets of L.A., it's not hard to find someone who wants to get in your way.<br />Robert Duvall plays an L.A. Robbery Detective who just happens to be working his last day before retirement.   He's chastised for having taken a desk job after a shooting incident, at the insistence of his wife (the only character in this movie I couldn't stand).  And he realizes most of his fellow cops won't miss him for long when he retires.  But, he's the only cop who links several violent crimes on that day to the vigilante defense worker.  He further redeems himself by tracking down and stopping the vigilante.  At the same time, he rescues his boys from his wife's purse and takes a stand for once in his life. <br />You'll find yourself cheering for the vigilante as he leaves death and destruction in his wake.  And at the same time, you can't help but feel sorry for him because his life is falling apart, hence the film's appropriately-named title, &quot;Falling Down&quot;.  I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  4+ stars.<br />If you liked this Joel Schumacher movie, I recommend one of his newest films, &quot;Phone Booth&quot;.

6304698690|3.0|I didnt like it. It was not true to the book wich is wonderful.They left out when Mary was in India completely and they interpret the magic Mary and Colin are always talking about all wrong. Also Mary didnt get locked in her room at all. It was a poor job and a great disapointment.
B00006CXXU|1.0|i give it one star for the song fighter.  i love pop music, and this cd is NOT it.  Can't hold us down, fighter, beautiful, cruz, soar, dirrty, a voice within, singing my song are good songs.  The rest are so absolutely dreadful, you'll want to throw up and never listen to her again.  Get the song fighter and her first and christmas cd.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|The blue CD in general never leaves my CD changer, and I dont forsee it ever leaving. Its just about as close to perfect as you can get. The addition of the 2nd disc just makes it better. Its great to finally get &quot;Mykel and Carli&quot;, &quot;Suzanne&quot;, and &quot;Jamie&quot; on the same CD, and to hear Weezer stripped down (the acoustic tracks, and the Kitchen Tapes) really make this Band stand out as one of the best out there. In Particular, the acoustic version of &quot;No One Else&quot; is great. Also, these guys can really sing.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I love Josh Groban.  His voice will melt anyone's heart.  Now, I must admit, I ordered the version of this with the dvd and the extra tracks from his website.  This album is absolutely beautiful.  The effortless gifted use of pop and classical is so divine.  You raise me up beautifully crafts a masterpiece of instrumental and vocal, unifying them in a gorgeous creation.  This cd gives something for classical to adult contemporary lovers.  I'd agree that the one thing lacking of it is too many songs in foreign languages; sorry, i like vocal songs in english. This album is even better than his first! :-)
B000060P79|4.0|I dont understand why everybody hates this CD because it is not &quot;punk&quot;. Tell me please, what is punk. I think that maybe music in general is evolving, and this just happens to fit the bill for today. I dont think that It will be one of those CDs that stands the test of time, but I think its one of the best CDs of today. I think thats all that matters, and not whether or not its punk, or whether the lyrics are too &quot;poppy&quot;. Just listen to the CD, dont go in with a biased opinion, hoping to hear this perfect &quot;Punk&quot; music. Listen to the music these guys put out there for you to hear, and if you dont like it, turn it off and quit B**ching.
B00003CXSP|3.0|Let's face it: &quot;Hannibal&quot; is nowhere near as good as &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; (I'm talking movies, not books). To quote Charter, &quot;Far-fetched and gory.&quot; Plus it fails to capture Lecter's true intentions toward Starling (as brotherly or fatherly, not romantic). Yet, somehow, the film is oddly satisfying, and I find myself draw to it whenever it's on. The mix of operatic score during chaotic scenes is strangely effective (similar to the ethereal tracks during intense scenes in the LOTR series of films). So, no, it's not a great movie, and Lecter's behavior is sometimes &quot;out of character,&quot; but the movie is satisfying nonetheless.
B000001FDQ|5.0|as if i could even! well, apparently one mUSt enter a star chart..for the record, might i say that even attempting to qualify mr puntang malmsteen's work questions his very potency..<BR>this is inexcusable and a great insult to just such an axeman..my clients and i SALUTE mr. malmsteen and his RISING forces..and lo! the heavens opened and the firmament quivered when once i under bright star lay, the seraphim sounds of screaming leads blitzing such labrodorian skies..
B00021TL20|4.0|This cd is actually Face Value from 1981, No Jacket Required from 1985 and ...But Seriously from 1989.  There are no bonus tracks, different versions or anything to get excited about.  I definately think it would be cheaper just to buy those three great cd's.  I mean afterall, if you are a Phil Collins fan you probably already own one or two of these cd's.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As I understand it the original name of Star Trek was Wagon Train to the Stars. It was envisioned, and even pitched, as a western set in space. Joss Whedon's Firefly does a better job of that.<br /><br />It is the future, Humanity has expanded to the stars as we exhausted the resources of our own planet. There is a central government for the various planets, but not all planets benefit equally from this. The Central planets are very well policed and run, as well as rich. The outer planets are not as fortunate. In most ways they resemble a dificult place to live, and normally have strong thematic elements based around the western United States during its colonization phase.<br /><br />Enter Captain Malcom Reynolds and his ship the Serenity, a firefly class cargo vessel. His crew consists of Zoe, his first mate, her husband, Wash, the pilot, Kaylee his engineer, and of course Jayne, his well enforcer. As the series begin they take on passengers, some which become crew, and others that are passengers for the long haul.<br /><br />Nathan Fillion gains first billing, but Firefly is truly an ensemble cast. Each character, though fitting into a western stereotype, is given a chance to develop. Some of the cast are mysterious, some are almost predictable, but overall the chemistry was truly remarkable.<br /><br />This is a series that can be enjoyed in a number of ways; by following the characters, or following the developments, or just by sitting back and allowing yourself a chance to drift into a different world. It is not a flashy Sci-Fi series with lots of effects. This is Science Fiction, a great tale about people that just happens to occur against the backdrop of our future, a future with both progress and failure. One other thing, there is not the plethora of races in this world, only humans.<br /><br />This is one of the most enjoyable series I have ever watched. I recommend it to everyone, but especially to those who like good Science Fiction, or those that miss westerns.<br /><br />I would have preferred to give it 4 1/2 stars, as there are a number of questions that remain unanswered, but as we cannot rate on half points, I am more than happy to round this series, a true gem, up to a five.ve it 4 1/2 stars, as there are a number of questions that remain unanswered, but as we cannot rate on half points, I am more than happy to round this series, a true gem, up to a five.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac's classic album \\"Me Against The World\\" was an anyalsis of a vulnerable, abondoned Pac just before he went to prison. His next album, \\"All Eyez on Me\\", is a look into the mind of a man on a mission: to absolutly DOMINATE the entire rap game. Indeed, when Pac came out of prison, all eyes were on him. After going through a number of tumultuious and unspeakable experiences the year before, what would become of him now that he was free??<br />The result was this 27-track monster, which remains one of the hardest hitting and most intense albums ever released. Unlike on Me Against The World, this album showcased a much more intense, hungrier-and angrier, Tupac. The beats on this album have that classic Death Row sound, and pack a much harder punch than any of his previous albums. The album was the first rap double cd ever, reached #1 on the charts, had 7 singles and would go on to become one of the highest selling and most critically acclaimed rap albums of all time. Before this album, Pac was a rap star. After it, he was an ICON. <br />\\"All Eyez on Me\\" is one of the most complete rap albums ever made, and Pac gives you so many different kinds of songs to groove to, you cant really go wrong with it, regardless of what type of mood you're in. This album is a TITAN, and an album that really packs a punch everytime you bang it. If you want that classic hardcore Death Row sound, songs like \\"Ambitionz az A Ridah\\", \\"No More Pain\\", \\"Cant C Me\\", or \\"When We Ride\\" will get the job done. Lots of great club songs, like \\"All About U\\", \\"Thug Passion\\", \\"How Do U Want It\\", or \\"Cali Love\\" as well. For those who want deeper/more intellectual Pac, not as much of that on this album, but he still gives you a few gems: \\"Life Goes On\\", \\"I Aint Mad At Cha\\", \\"Only God Can Judge Me\\" and the anti-prostitution anthem, \\"Wonder Why They Call U Bitch\\"......its not Pac's best album lyrically, but the variety, great production, and wonderful replay value more than make up for it. <br />This is easily one of the most groundbreaking rap albums ever, setting countless trends. So many of todays rappers have used this album as a blueprint and/or standard for making their own albums, but no rap album coming out nowadays can even come close to this. The scary thing is, he made this classic in only two weeks......<br />All in all, this is a must have.....of all of Pac's albums, this is near the top, and I would consider only \\"Makaveli: The 7 Day Theory\\" to be superior, and \\"Me Against The World\\" being about equal. All Eyez on Me is essential for any hip hop collection.
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|Mystic River is a well-written story with well developed characters, several subplots, and an intriguing theme.  Eastwood brings out the drama through thorough character development by creating a connected history for the characters that continues throughout the film.  The cinematography is well balanced with terrific performances by the cast (including Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and many others), which displays a realistic atmosphere.  This atmosphere creates a clash between the screen and the viewer as the story depicts some disturbing elements.  The disturbing elements provide a suspenseful tension that does not let go even after the end credits.<br />The story begins with one of the three main characters being kidnapped and molested as a child by two strangers.  This traumatic experience plays an essential role in the story as it connects the main characters and attributes to their personalities.  This attribution of personal characteristics pulls the audience into an unwanted, yet unavoidable direction.  Consequently, Mystic River offers an exceptionally good cinematic experience that will leave the audience pondering for a long time.
B0000CDL93|5.0|I am a student of film, and scriptwriting. I've learned about lighting, budget cost, directing, and scriptwriting. I've even written scripts that are set in history. Ya go in cocky thinkin', yeah, I'll make this movie so historically accurate, everthing will be precise down to the very minute! But after printing out eight pounds of paper on every small detail, you start to realise that nobody, and I mean nobody can make a decent historically accurate film without losing your mind! <br />I've very carefully researched the assasination and I came across a very professional web site. Other web sites are very passonate, but this one was very by-the-book: something like &quot;I believe this, but not that, and here's twelve pages of info showing why,&quot; kind of thing. I E-mailed him and asked what he thought of Oliver Stone's JFK; he said he'd give it a C+. Based on my troubles, that's really good!<br />I have to make this clear: JFK is ENTERTAINMENT based on fact. Making a good story is hard enough, but researching facts to back it up is going to tear apart your brain! <BR>Do we have to spell it out for you people! The film encourages you to YOUR OWN RESEARCH. Donald Sutherland even says it in the film: &quot;But don't trust me; do your own work, your own thinking.&quot; Their are people out their that think they're so smart saying, &quot;oh look, that didn't happen in real life; I guess the movie is garbage, then.&quot; I've seen it with &quot;JFK&quot;, with &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, and even the fictional, &quot;Lord of the Rings.&quot;<br />&quot;Oh, the bullet that hit Kennedy was a tumbling bullet and that's why the bullet looks so perfect,&quot; they say. Let me ask you something: have you ever seen a tumbling bullet? They're flat, flat as a pancake. As if a steam roller went over it. And this bullet supposedly went through several bones. For all we know the bullet was squished AFTER it was collected (just a little, so no one will notice. Shhhh). Ibet you skeptics don't know what frame of the Z-film the &quot;magic bullet&quot; hit the president? What's the name of the document stating the withdrawl of ALL U.S. troops from Vietnam by 1965? What mafia kingfish did Johnny Roselli have conections with? Do you even know who Johnny Roselli is? What about Beverly Oliver? Jim Marrs? James Tague? Perry Russo? What velocity was Oswald's rifle? WHAT WAS Oswald's rifle? Where did he buy it? Who's James Files?<br />This film is about judging for yourself. Check it out on the internet, buy a book, then buy the other guy's book and compair.<br />The more I think of the supression of this subject by the media today, the more I realise that this is not a 40 year old subject. It's here, it's now! It's in the TV! It's in the walls! It's on the radio! It's out the window! It's in the newspapers! It's just a question of who's willing to see it. Keven Costner said it best &quot;Don't you think THIS, has something to do with THAT! CAN'T YOU SEE!&quot; <br />Who cares that there were no women on Jim Garrison's legal team (unlike in the movie). Who cares that Garrison never called Clay Shaw a liar right to his face(dramatic licence). Who cares that Garrison's closing statement was a composite of the speech he DID GIVE, lines in his book, and Stone's own additions(proper pacing of a story). That little stuff doesn't matter!<br />The Warren Commision is a myth, and Oliver Stone's JFK is anti-myth.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Resident Evil is a nitroglycerin packed horror film that is based on Capcom's best selling horror videogames with the same name.  Before the story begins the audience is introduced to the Umbrella Corporation that produces 90% of every home's household products.  However, its large profits are derived from military technology, genetic experimentation and viral weaponry, which is unknown to the public.  The story begins with Alice (Milla Jovovich) waking up with temporary amnesia caused by gas released by the Hive's supercomputer, the Red Queen, as a defense mechanism.  The Hive is a secret underground research complex with an exterior design similar to the form of a virus, which hosts over 500 scientists.  Alice learns through a group of special operatives working for the Umbrella Corporation that she is also a special operative and something has gone wrong in the Hive.  The mission of the group is to find out what went wrong and turn off the Red Queen that has seemed to run amok.  As the group enters the darkened corridors of the Hive they enter a nightmare that submerges them into an agonizing reality of hellish creatures that want to nourish.  Resident Evil is a fast paced horror tale where the unknown is known, yet the moment of surprise will cause nerves to twitch involuntary as it offers a creepy cinematic experience.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This CD is much better than I expected In my personal opinion its much better than the first if you liked Avril`s debut album Let Go you are going to love this one if u didnt ur goin to hate it I like this one better than the first one my favorites tracks are Dont Tell Me, Together, Take Me Away and He Wasnt My Happy Ending is my absolute favorite song in the whole thing. Under My skin Rocks
B0000C8AVI|5.0|&quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; was exactly that-this album was more inevitable than most people realized, and a turning point in the career of Bob Dylan, not just commercially but, obviously, spiritually. Some called the Christian transition &quot;bizarre;&quot; but it's strange how no one complained when Pete Townshend expressed his religious beliefs in Meher Baba, or when actor Richard Gere became a Buddhist, which suggests some sort of prejudice. There's nothing wrong with a celebrity finding religion, but Dylan's transition is another example of the harsh standards that fans set for celebrities. What's worse is that they expect them to live by those standards. (Confusingly enough, Dylan actually said in 1983 &quot;Whoever said I was Christian? I am a humanist!&quot;)<br />Dylan had been wandering for quite sometime, searching for himself in a way, while all at once becoming the &quot;voice of a generation.&quot; What that generation probably didn't know was that their leader (a title Dylan denounced), the person they came to believe in, was searching for something to believe in too. And he obviously had good reason; in 1970, the generation he inspired turned on him at the drop of a hat, only that hat was in the form of an album called &quot;Self Portrait,&quot; a purposely disastrous album Dylan released in hopes that critics and fans would remember he had told them &quot;don't follow leaders.&quot; As he would later say, &quot;I wanted out.&quot; They forgave him after another album, &quot;New Morning.&quot; One rock and roll headline read &quot;We've Got Dylan Back Again.&quot; But did Dylan have Dylan back? He wandered throughout the 70s, singing about what he was becoming increasingly knowledgeable about, his domestic family life (1974's &quot;Planet Waves&quot;) and later the trials of a shaky marriage (&quot;Blood On the Tracks,&quot; pieces of 1976's &quot;Desire&quot;).<br />Therefore, &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; is a joy to listen to because it finds Dylan finally at some form of peace. The last time he'd sounded this satisfied was probably on the laid-back country of 1969's &quot;Nashville Skyline.&quot; He had been singing about the elements found in this album for years. Only now, Dylan knew that it was God who gave him the gift to do so. One should look back at the echoes of the book of Isaiah in 'All Along the Watchtower,' a song that seemed eerily similar to Mark 13:35. Some would accuse Dylan's lyrics for this album of being judgmental. Not so. He was actually singing about the same kinds of people found in older songs like 'Ballad of a Thin Man;' those who have &quot;been through all of F. Scott Fitzgerald's books,&quot; who are &quot;very well read&quot; but still &quot;something is happening&quot; and they &quot;don't know what it is.&quot; Dylan is more focused and diligent on &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot; than anything he had ever recorded before, and this clear-headed motivation would even carry into his albums of the 80s and 90s, whether they were Christian or secular. Songs like 'When You Gonna Wake Up' and the subtle-but-anthemic 'Gotta Serve Somebody' are no more &quot;judgemental&quot; than the lyrics of 'Like a Rolling Stone.' As a matter of fact, none of his work was judgemental, they are simply Dylan describing the kinds of characters and truths life is full of. Tracks like 'Precious Angel' and 'Slow Train' meanwhile are the peaks of Bob Dylan's goal on this album.<br />&quot;Slow Train Coming,&quot; in some ways, had the same side-effects as &quot;Self Portrait.&quot; The non-Christian fans became disgusted that &quot;their&quot; Bob Dylan could think for himself and not simply follow the beliefs his fans wanted him to follow, rather than his own. Some fans covered their ears, others made excuses and claimed it was just a cry for help. The reviews for mixed, but the record sold, making it a minor classic, and the music within is always superb. Subsequent Christian albums &quot;Saved&quot; and &quot;Shot of Love&quot; were not as well respected, and Dylan would allegedly move back to &quot;secular&quot; recordings with the strong &quot;Infidels&quot;; but even that album contained some references to both Christianity and Judaism influenced by Dylan's research in spiritual Rastafarianism, sparking many theories as to what exactly was influencing the songwriter at that point and whether &quot;secular&quot; was the word to describe it. But it was the best thing he could have done at this point; had Dylan continued to record strictly Christian rock his star would have faded, his audience lost. And whether or not he kept the values of &quot;Slow Train Coming,&quot; every word, every note is the solid truth, something Dylan was never afraid to tell.ot;Shot of Love&quot; were not as well respected, and Dylan would allegedly move back to &quot;secular&quot; recordings with the strong &quot;Infidels&quot;; but even that album contained some references to both Christianity and Judaism influenced by Dylan's research in spiritual Rastafarianism, sparking many theories as to what exactly was influencing the songwriter at that point and whether &quot;secular&quot; was the word to describe it.

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals is a forgotten only remeber by fans of pink floyd. It is a forgotten becuase A. it has no real radio singles and B. is a dark distrubing album. the concept is that we are all aminals. Pigs are rich power brokers who run things  Dogs are the power grabbers and have no morals and are ruthless and Sheep who are easily herd and abused by the dogs and pigs. Pigs(three diffrent ones) show how patheic and controlling there are.  Sheep shows that abusing the sheep can back fire and they can turn on you. Dogs show that ruthless can ruin your life and to be ruthless you can trust only yourself and no one thus rendering you alone in the world. pigs on the wings parts 1 and 2 is a warning to be aware of the pigs coming to control you. It is dark and gritty and punkish. It is a masterpieces that deserved to be top 4 of floyd. Dark side of the moon, wIsh you were here  and The Wall are the top 3. 5 stars
B00005JLEX|5.0|Yes it's true, the long awaited (too long if you ask me) Seinfeld DvDs are coming out.  The first set will consist of seasons 1 and 2 (17 episodes).  It will contain tons of bonus features and interviews with the cast (unlike the Curb sets)<BR>(...)
0440234743|5.0|This is another great lawyer-story from Grisham. It takes many twists and turns with a good cast of characters, eventually ending with something that was a suprise to me. The varied characters and the adventures they immerse themselves in helps keep the pace and enjoyment level of this story afloat. Sometimes the legal jargan gets to be a bit much, but its rare and not too bad. Great story!
B00003CXXP|4.0|Guaranteed, the sight of the wonderful Haley Joel Osment begging his mommy not to leave him in the forest is one of the most tearjerking moments in recent film history.  It is in these first 40 minutes or so that the heart of this movie is established.  Osment, Sam Robards and Frances O'Connor deliver impeccable performances that put the viewer in their clutches.  However, once the movie leaves this behind and ventures out into David's search for the Blue Fairy, we get a combination of so many classics like Star Wars, Blade Runner, etc., that the movie starts to lose its heart.  Jude Law is fine as Gigolo Joe, but he is so plasticized that he never connects.  William Hurt as the inventor of the boy robot comes across as some kind of warped Gepetto who doesn't even love his creation.<br />The special effects are flawless and Spielberg's ET sense of wonder abounds.  Doesn't the space balloon remind you of the moon in ET?  The movie becomes a special effects festival thereafter, and even when David gets his wish of one day with his mother, she is so vacuous and sterile you wonder what the joy is.<br />I'm certainly in awe of the technical superiority of this film, but still felt a little empty when it was over.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I love Errol Morris's work -- genius stuff.  I have many thoughts about this movie, but just want to share one:<br />McNamara uses the phrase &quot;fog of war&quot; so effectively in the movie, but that phrase refers to the chaos on the ground in battle.  Yet he was at the top of a chain of command MOUNTAIN, with the broadest view possible.  So for him to excuse his errors in judgment because they were due to the &quot;fog of war&quot; is, at best, INACCURATE, and at worst, (self?) DECEPTIVE.<br />I only hope that my take on this resonates with others who watch the movie.  I felt that McNamara was still doing damage control and duping me four decades after the fact!
6305558167|4.0|John Boorman's film is beautifully filmed and staged.  The battles are convincing; they are not pretty and there is much dismemberment and agony.  Boorman's vision of the Arthurian legend is handled reverently, although at times it appears he took on too much.  The search for the Holy Grail comes out of nowhere; Guinevere falls in love with Lancelot without any interplay or reasoning; Arthur becomes old and disheartened without any real background.  However, the performances from the likes of Helen Mirren, Nicol Williamson, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne are ferocious, and even though Nigel Terry doesn't possess the heart of Arthur and Nicholas Clay is too wimpy a Lancelot, the film overall is a cavalcade of wonder and awe, with a wonderful musical score to boot.<br />I loved EXCALIBUR when it first appeared in 1981; now I like it for what Boorman tried to do, and coming out on top more often than not.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril never really caught my attention until I heard &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; on the radio and I thought it was kinda cool. So I borrowed the album from a friend and when I heard the first track &quot;Take Me Away&quot; I thought she was just copying from Amy Lee of Evanescence but it was cool anyway. The next song &quot;Together&quot; has really good music but the lyrics say &quot;Together we built our wall&quot;. I mean what is that?<BR>The next song &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; saves the album. Then there's &quot;He Wasn't&quot;, good music, good lyrics,good way to tell a boy off. Another ugly thing is &quot;How Does it feel&quot;. Most of the song she spends it asking &quot;How does it feel to be different from me?&quot; but we all know from the way she sings it that she really does not care about the answer. &quot;My Happy Ending&quot; the second single off the album is one of its highlights' again good music and really REALLY good lyrics. &quot;Nobody's Home&quot; another of the albums highlight, good music, good lyrics. &quot;Forgotten&quot; was the song when I thought I had to get this album (which I did) it is a really good song. &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; good one not the best but it was good. Track 11 &quot;Freak Out&quot; has the cheesiest punk-wannabe lyrics &quot;I'll walk around with my hands up in the air/ Cuz I don't care&quot;. &quot;Slipped Away&quot; is the most emotional song off the record and it has good music and really good lyrics. The whole album is good. Even if its not the kind of music you like this album is a genious and an award winner. That is why my rating is so high.
B000056VPD|4.0|George Benson is an absolute legend.  If you don't believe me, see him in this 2000 concert!  While not all of his hits are covered, the ones I love are.  Nothing can prepare you for his performances of &quot;This Masquerade&quot; and &quot;Breezin'&quot;.  Simply stunning, turn up as loud as you can.<br />DVD SUMMARY:  The DVD I have boasts both a DTS soundtrack and a 5.1 mix.  Most times I would pick the DTS soundtrack on a music DVD, but on this occassion, the 5.1 mix has a more natural sound to it.  If you have a surround sound system, choose this mix over the DTS. An earlier DVD release features a 2.0 mix which is ideal for people with only two speakers.  <br />A wonderful DVD that should be in your collection.  Its only letdowns are that the playlist is rather short, and the amount of overweight ladies in the crowd (as mentioned in other reviews).
0743424425|5.0|Whoever feels King puts too much superfluous detail in this book is dead wrong. If one truly pays attention, even to the seemingly minor details, you find they all tie together in the end. In this book King wonderfully illustrates the conflict within/without each character. Not to mention, even minor characters are brought to life with stunning descriptions. I, personally, am once again astounded by King's ability to create a seemingly flawless alternate world!
B00005JKZV|1.0|This film is soo nothing. The only time its interesting is when Gollum is on screen . The rest suuucks. Stupid hollywood cheese jokes about dwarf tossing and skating a rail with a sheild. Embarrassing. Lifeless story and perfomances, bar Gollum. Worst of the Trilogy. Give me Krull anyday.
B000002H3E|4.0|I doubt that a two word sentence was ever uttered with the words 'Dokken' and 'Rules' in alphabetical order. Of all the hard rocking L.A. hair metal bands, Dokken was a unique mystery. They were not really power pop because of George Lynch's amazing guitar skills, and they weren't Bon Jovi either, even though Don Dokken wanted everyone to think he was just as sexy and talanted (I for one think that Bon Jovi sucks, but that style was where the money was in the decadant 80's).<br />Dokken was a meat and potato rock n roll band, period. They hit it big for a short time on MTV with the video 'In my Dreams', followed by 'It's not Love'. Belive it or not a cheap and worthless black and white fuzzy video was shot for 'The Hunter' that played on Headbanger's Ball maybe two times.<br />Under Lock and Key is a good definition of what Dokken is and what they could have been. When you hear a song like 'Lightning Strikes' you say these guys can really rock, but when you hear stuff like Slippin' Away, you laugh at them for being a cheezy hair band. I don't know of anyone who detests Dokken, but I don't think they were anyone's favorite band. Here's the best way to send them up.<br />When a Poison or Warrant fan put them on, they were into 'the hard stuff', however a Slayer or Anthrax fan could play them without being embarrassed.
6302765536|5.0|This movie is too FUNNY!!!I love the Second Home Alone Movie as much as I like the 1st one.My favorite part the movie when Kevin sets up those Boob Traps for the 2 Burglars.And gets the wrong that goes to New York & Kevin gets sparated from his family again.This movie is the best,I gotta get this movie!!!
B0001FR3IQ|4.0|Gothika may not be for everyone, but it is a good movie, and it is clear that the writers and director put a lot of effort into it. Halle Berry plays one of her best roles yet as Dr. Miranda Grey, who assumes a career at a mental hospital. On the way home from work, Grey encounters a strange girl standing in the middle of the road - and eventually winds up in the cell of the hospital she works at! Things turn from bad to worse when she learns that she has murdered her husband - and she is led on a wild goose chase to discover what really happened the night before, and what is the purpose of the strange images she is encountering. I don't really classify this as a horror movie, because I wasn't really scared at all when watching it - it's more of a dark sci-fi film, much like The Ring or The Others. I can't give Gothika 5 stars however, because it has little replay value. It's a refreshing experience, but is not to be seen too often. But if you're looking for a good rental, Gothika is perfect for you.
1592400876|5.0|This was the grammar book I wished I had back in grammar school.  As you read this book, you'll nod your head at every page, recognizing those painfully common mistakes that fill up the Internet and magazine cover stories even with all the cool tools built into word processors.  <br />Truss's focus is on correct pronunciation in the English language and the way it's been increasingly skewered.  Though she's from the UK, this book is equally useful for Aussies and Americans who've been similarly flustered by pitiful punctuation.  The best part of Truss's book, it makes it easy for you to absorb the lessons and make yourself better understood.
B0001Z52RU|2.0|Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) is a gifted college student whose childhood was plagued by blackouts that occurred during the pivotal moments of his life. Revisiting his old journals, he finds that he is able to relive these moments, and sets out to right past wrongs. However, with each intervention, he ends up radically altering his - and his friends' - presents: the \\"butterfly effect\\" to which the film's title refers.<BR>It's an intriguing premise, but one that this flick seems infuriatingly incapable of living up to. Alarm bells start ringing right from the off: the opening quote, explaining the titular effect, is credited not to a writer but merely to \\"chaos theory\\". Sloppy stuff, and things don't get much better thereafter. Take the fact that, in spite of altering his past, Evan is still able to remember exactly what he's done, waking-up in an unfamiliar bed with a dopey \\"how did I get here?\\" expression with each flap of that darned butterfly's wings. Shouldn't he be as oblivious as everyone around him? Maybe it's unfair to expect academic rigor from your average filmmaker, but it would've been nice to see a little more thought applied here. It's a bit like Darren Aronofsky's \\"Pi\\", whose mathematical genius fluffed even basic equations - more effort, please, people...<BR>Such quibbles aside, the screenplay does offer a few treats, with the repercussions of Evan's interventions alternately screwing him and his circle of friends in all manner of increasingly sick ways. Having his friend Tommy pop up in one revision as a psychopath, then in another as a devout Christian, was inspired; props to Amy Smart, too, for making a convincing stab at her character Kayleigh's alternate versions - cute girlfriend, traumatized waitress, drug-addicted hooker... Would that the same could be said about Kutcher, really. Fair play to him for trying his hand at some more \\"heavyweight\\" material, but he barely gets out of first gear.<BR>The same is true of \\"The Butterfly Effect\\"'s attempts to tackle serious issues - disability, child abuse, prostitution, animal rights... It's encouraging to see a major picture refusing to shy away from such controversial subjects, but it's hard to shirk off the nagging doubt that writers Gruber and Bress introduced them more for their shock value than to get any dialogue started. The sheer quantity of Weighty Issues vying for attention here means that nothing ever gets more than a few minutes in the spotlight. It's more a case of: \\"kiddy-fiddling? Check. Let's see what else we can fit in...\\"<BR>All in all, \\"The Butterfly Effect\\" makes for a bit of a depressing experience, a whole that's much smaller than the sum of its parts. It may be asking too much to demand thought-provoking content, coherent scripting and a decent lead from what is - let's face it - really just a popcorn flick. But to have a film promise so much, and deliver so little? Well, it makes you wish that, like Evan, you could go back in time and offer your services for the rewrite.
0786930640|2.0|I was glad to see the DragonLance Chronicles re-issued in hard cover--they are classics, after all. They are very enjoyable stories (the fact that the world abides by the rules of AD&amp;D is a bit annoying, but once you get past that, it's fine :-).<br />The problem I have with this edition is the abysmal editing job--if indeed any editing occured. You will encounter typos ever few pages, sometimes 2 or 3 on a page, in ALL THREE VOLUMES. It gets very tiresome. Wizards of the Coast seems to not have an editorial staff, as their edition of Salvatore's _Dark Elf_ has the same problem.<br />Please, Wizards of the Coast, hire some editors before you publish books! Weis and Hickman should be outraged that their work was so defaced!
B0001ENYKS|4.0|I got this CD with my employee discount at work, and while I like it, I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it.  A few of the songs are real stand-outs; look at other reviews for track listings.  However, the tempo, and the inflection of the vocals become repetitive and very consistent.  On the first listen through, I admit that I wasn't listening for vocals, but I never got super into it, or had any song break my attention away from what I was doing on the computer.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This could have rivaled Rumours, which isn't as perfect as people now remember it being. (It's still pretty close.) Say You Will suffers from bulk and Buckingham. The bulk comes in the form of a 76-minute album that far outlasts its interest. Lindsey Buckingham adds volumes to this problem with songs like the unnecessary \\"Come,\\" a seven-minute thrasher which simply doesn't work, and the indulgent \\"Murrow Turning In His Grave.\\" Cut this album down to 12 songs, though, and it's a thing of beauty. The title track, \\"Miranda,\\" \\"Peacekeeper,\\" and the spectacular \\"Thrown Down\\" are among the best of Fleetwood Mac's work, and that's saying something. A flawed jewel, perhaps, but with a little polish and a programmable player, Say You Will makes a fine album indeed.
0767020308|3.0|If you long for period costumes, genteel conversation and delightful scenery alone, this is your movie. If you long for wit, whim and wonder, this adaptation might disappoint you. Heroine Emma lacks the esential Austen charme and comes off spoiled and even mean with hardly ever a counter-balance which youthful grace, playfulness and whimsical folly might bestow. Mr. Knightly appears as the suprise lover (if you don't know the story line) because there is so little sensual fizz between him and Emma (a lack which I place again at the heroine's feet). <BR>If the comparison with A&amp;E's &quot;Pride And Prejudice&quot; be allowed, Lizzy and Mr Darcy are beguiling and loveable whereas this Emma and Mr Kightly are genteely vexing and never more than that.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|This is part of a planned pair-Want Two is due next year--so it's possible that in a few months I'll have some second thoughts about Wainwright's decision to cleave his bombastic efforts in two. On the other hand, W2 is supposedly the darker and more experimental half of the material from the sessions, so the division may have been an apt one.<br />Either way, Want One earns its five stars for several qualities. It's consistently good-there are songs that are better than the rest, but none that beg to be skipped. The slowest songs are the shortest, maintaining a flow that carries the album along. The best song of all, &quot;Go or Go Ahead,&quot; is the longest, over six minutes of outburst that weaves myth and madness into a stunning package of sonic bliss. A microcosm for the album as a whole, the song builds for more than two minutes before erupting.<br />Lyrically dense, the album starts out in near nonsense territory with the repetitions of &quot;Oh What a World&quot; and builds to the poignant &quot;Dinner at Eight,&quot; an almost tear-inducing finale that acknowledges Rufus's mixed feelings about his abandonment by his famous father. &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot; and &quot;Movies of Myself&quot; belong on Top 40 radio, where they could oust less intelligent pop; &quot;11:11&quot; sounds silly at first but makes profound the words &quot; I was alive.&quot; Born of personal experience and genetically inherited musical genius, Wainwright's latest may be the finest album of 2003.
B000003TA4|5.0|Dude, why don't you get a life? Seriously, you've already written about 30  1-star reviews in the past year on this CD. Yeah, I think we get the point by now. If you don't like the music fine, but quite saying that Nirvana paved the way for Good Charlotte and Korn and stuff like that. Just because some terrible bands say they were 'inspired' by Nirvana doesn't mean it's Nirvana's fault. If you want to listen to your cheesy '80s hairmetal fine, just remember some people here appreciate music with some substance and meaning.
B000092ZYX|4.0|So brilliant, so easy to forget. That's the verdict on the new Radiohead, it seems. This CD rode around with me for months, and it still lives in my head-or parts of it do. \\"2+2=5\\" is the perfect opener for an album whose title was swiped from the sign of a Bush protester. And even the more experimental songs are very good-at least a few times around. Unfortunately, while they can grow on you enough to enjoy them, they still force on the listener a moderation that keeps the gems of this album, like \\"There There,\\" \\"Myxomatosis,\\" and \\"Wolf at the Door\\" away from needy ears for too long, both on the back-loaded album itself and over time, as Hail gathers a bit of dust despite its genius. Radiohead was a couple songs away from a truly transcendent album. That makes the result that much harder to accept.
B000089RVX|5.0|i love this albun it is the coolest album i've ever had except 4 ZOEGIRL(christian music)but i steel like it only a whole BUNCH!!!       :) ;)
B0001Z363W|5.0|I'm sick and tired of people bad-mouthing this album! I know it isn't as heavy as his other work, but this deffinately some of his best. I know you Hardcore Metal fans, which I am, are disappointed with this album, I find it to be a great change, he's playing stuff like Bob Seger and Neil Young, and aside from loving metal I also love that kind of stuff. Zakk is just playing his influences, he's playing what he wants to play, I think he's made enough where he could care less if this album doesn't sell, and I think that might be half the reason he made this album. When I bought this album, looking at the cover, with the two skulls and the flamming shot-glass, I was sure it was gonna be as heavy as his other great albums, but when I put the CD on I was shocked to hear how much he sounded like Bob Seger. I think maybe he could have had maybe a few heavier songs, but he made it exactly for the title, Hangover Music, and when you get a hangover, you don't want something heavy and brutal to just add on to your headache, you want something relaxing to get rid of the headache! I don't think this new mellow side that Zakk's going for will last, he's just experimenting, and in music, that's exactly what every band should do, sometimes it works out better, and sometimes it makes things worse, and in Zakk's case, it was something that worked out great for him, at least that's my opinion!
B00005B3Z6|5.0|While the American version of QAF focuses on sensationalism and sleaze, the original British version takes a more artistic approach to presenting gay life.  Sure there are sex scenes, and soap operish situations, but they are handled in a more realistic manner.  Watching this rich version of QAF is like watching a really good independent film.  The acting is solid, the characters are multi-dimensional, and the writing is top-notch.  Unlike the American version, drugs and backrooms are downplayed in UK's version of QAF.  The only time drugs come into play is when one of the characters dies from an overdose.
B000002JS8|5.0|This is definetely the best album by Ac/Dc and the cause is the great Bon Scott. All songs are very cool and filled with groove.<BR>My personal favourites include Walk All over You, Touch Too Much and the excellent Night Prowler.    <BR>NI!
B00024I31C|4.0|Great to have yet another JJ Cale album. Though it has been a long time since his last studio album &quot;Guitar Man&quot;, new Cale albums are always worth waiting for.<br />Don`t expect big changes in his musical style. He sticks with his classic laid back style. Most of the songs on this new album have brothers or sisters in his extensive back-catalogue. &quot;My Gal&quot; and &quot;Jailer&quot;, &quot;The Problem&quot; and &quot;I`ll Kiss The World Goodbye&quot; , &quot;Rio&quot; and &quot;Don`t Cry Sister&quot; etc. This is no problem for me personally, because us usual the &quot;feeling&quot; is there.<br />The album starts off with 5 traditional Cale songs. It is not until the 6th track that the melodic side of him really shows. &quot;The Problem&quot;, &quot;Homeless&quot; and &quot;Fancy Dancer&quot; are already favourites of mine.<br />Cale has made yet another fine album and has lived up to his own high standards.<br />&quot;Grasshopper&quot; is still my favourite album, though.
1400032717|5.0|I have a confession to make. I'm not the most observant person in the world. When I picked up The Curious Incident off of my brother's bookshelf, I didn't bother to note the Author's name, and barely remembered the title. I dove right into the story,  under the impression that this was Christopher's real nonfictional account of the incredible events that occured in his life around the murder of Ms. Shears' dog. My impression was sustained all 220+ pages of the novel. This alone attests to the incredible skill Haddon has used in crafting a completely believable protagonist, a character who deserves not only my sympathy, but also my empathy in basic human issues rarely explained so clearly and beautifully. Christopher is truly a loveable person, and his logical analysis of the world around him creates many instances of quirky humor.<br />When I finally did finish the book, I turned to the back cover to look for the author picture. What I found was Mark Haddon staring back at me. The dead giveaway that this man was indeed not Christopher was his left earring. The Christopher I knew would not subject himself to an ear piercing. I checked to see if this could be a &quot;red herring,&quot; and if my assumption was correct all along. But it was not. I came to this realization sadly because of all the respect I had built up for Christopher. But I let it go, as one must after any good novel, and reminisced instead on the content of the book.<br />As you can see, I had a unique and profound experience reading this book. Always enjoyable, clever, and captivating, Haddon has managed to capture my 14-year-old mind. Hopefully, he'll do the same for you
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|Room on Fire is a great album if you were a fan of the first.  They pretty much stick with the same formula, which is fine because it sure worked for me on Is this It.  Stand out tracks include &quot;What Ever Happened&quot;, &quot;Reptilia&quot;, &quot;12:51&quot;, &quot;You Talk Way Too Much&quot;, &quot;Under Control&quot;,The End Has No End&quot; and &quot;I Can't Win&quot;.<BR>The Strokes are the most original and interesting band in a world of awful modern rock.  I Can't Wait for the Next album..Keep up the good work and thanks for the great music guys..
B0000AQS0F|5.0|First off, ignore the hatchet job Fox did if you saw \\"Firefly\\" airing on network TV -- the DVD set is the true series. And what a series -- fantastic and brilliant TV.<br />This shortlived but brilliant show from Buffy creator Joss Whedon isn't just a series to rent, but one to own. It's just so richly textured -- every episode bears repetition, and brings on those funny, smart, sexy, and stylish moments so rare these days in the TV wasteland.<br /><br />\\"Firefly\\" is set 500 years in the future and is a very witty and adventurous \\"Sci-Fi Western\\" in a future in which everything is a mix of American with a dash of Chinese thrown in.  And those of you making faces at \\"oooh it's a Western\\" (I was one of them) -- I promise you'll like it anyway, even if you're not always a John Wayne type. ;-)<br />And even the special effects are fantastic -- a standout is a pulse-pounding chase from the terrifying Reavers in the two-hour pilot.  Everything looks feature-film slick.  It's great, smart Sci-Fi -- for instance, there is no sound in the space scenes (unlike the \\"whooshes\\" on Star Trek when the ship goes into hyperspace etc), because there is no sound in space.<br /><br />The characters are smart and brave and very funny, with a gorgeous and talented cast, and all 15 episodes are wonderful and offer a moment to savor. By the end, it feels like you've watched an extended miniseries or a novel for television. I went from liking the show on TV, to watching the DVDs and becoming a die-hard fan who treasures the entire set -- and can't wait for the feature film.
B0000630BT|5.0|I must say this in my mind is the best or maybe the second best Judas Priest album ever.  If you want a hardcore metal album rather than the lighter form Judas albums this is for you.  I'm not huge for Bristish Steel or Screaming For Vengance.  However, I go crazy for this album as well as the live one titled Judas Priest Live(They also made a video taping of that).  However, that live album to the best of my knowledge doesn't contain any of these tracks.  A Must Buy!!!!!!
B0000C0FJB|5.0|This is pure good-to-the-bone ROCK! Outstanding!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is one of the hottest pop stars of today. Her music is so catchy, so versatile and has good lyrics. She has grown into a more mature adult. And her songs prove that. this cd doesn't have that bubble-gum teen pop that she used to have. She now has mid-tempo pop songs, trancey/dance songs, hardcore hip/hop songs mixed with a lil reggea. She also has some pop and beautiful ballads. <br />1)Me against the music- 7.5/10 This song is the first single which includes the queen of pop, the almight Madonna. It has midtempo beat with some guitar riffs. It's ok. This song is radio-friendly and good for the clubs. it'll get u pumped up and make u shake ur booty on the dancefloor all night long!!!A really good video with good choreography.<BR>2)(I got that) boom Boom - 9.5/10 This song featurs the kings of the crunk, the Ying Yang Twins. This is an awesome hip/hop song. This song has a catchy chorus accompanied by an awesome beat with some banjos. This song will become a club-smash.<br />3)Showdown - 8/10 This song has a reggea/rock beat. it's very unusual. something that Britney has never done before. Very unique and interesting. this song is mid-tempo but still good. I'm guessing this song is about sex. Britney practically talks her way through the whole song and the chorus is pretty good.<BR>4)Breathe on me- 9.5/10 This song has a very trancey vibe to it. Very atmospheric. It's very reminiscent to a Kylie Minogue song. this song is good for grinding becasue it's so addicting and very sexual.<BR>5)early mornin- 4/10 O god! I hate this song so much! This is a Moby produced song. This song has no substance and is really dull. this songs about an after-party. It's kind of a song that Madonna would do. But i give britney props for tryin something different.<BR>6)Toxic- 10/10 Her 2nd single. This is the best song off the whole album. Very catchy. But it is waay to overplayed on the radio. But i still think it's awesome. This song kind of starts out like linkin parks \\"Faint\\". anyways this song has the 60's violins with an electro/pop feel to it. this song should be a theme for the hit tv show \\"Alias\\" starring Jennifer Gargner. The video is awesome with good production and special effects. But it's kind of a rip off to the No doubt video \\"It's my life\\" which has the same storyline.<BR>7)Outrageous 9/10 Just announced, this will be her 4th single. this is an R-Kelly penned track. Very vey radio-friendly and i think it would be a radi smash hit. It's a typical R.kelly song where Britney sings about her sex drives and shopping sprees. An awesome beat with the indian flutes in the background. The chorus is amazing.<BR>8)Touch of my hand- 8.5/10 (...). It's the most touching song and the most beautiful song out of whole album. it has amazing amazing asian/chinese strings with a good melody. It sounds a lot like \\"Frozen\\" by Madonna. Britney has a lot of guts to talk about a subject so personal. this song is electro/pop/asian<BR>9)The hook up 7/10 This is a pure reggea/carribean/puerto rican song. It's a very good dance song. But Britney should have collaborated with Sean Paul to add more flavour to this song. This song sounds a bit like \\"Baby boy\\" by Beyonce. But its good anyway.<BR>10)shadow - 9/10 the first ballad off the album. It's a matrix produced song which sounds a lot like \\"I'm with you\\" by Avril lavigne. This track is a little bit too overproduced but it;;s still pretty good. A top40 type material song. The best part is when the song reaches it's climax where Britney voice soars and is at its best.<BR>11)Brave new girl- 8.5/10 this is a bubblegum song that should have been on the legally blonde 2 soundtrack. This song is very catchy. sorta radio-friendly. britney attempts to rap in this song. And i must admitt that she's pretty good. Her voice is computerized all through the song. It should have been a Hilary duff song. and it kinda also sounds like \\"Ray of light\\" by Madonna at some parts of the song. Very poppy/techno/electrosong. But very good.<BR>12)Everytime- 10/10 this along with toxic is the best song on the album. this is her 3rd single. this song is very touchin and is one of the most beuatiful ballads i have ever heard. I can't believe Britney actually wrote the song along with the melody. Thats very impressing. This song, sadly is for her ex bf Justin timberlake. So britney must have cheated on Jt becasue she sings her heart out by sayin that she sorry. this song has very nice piano riffs accompanied by a good harp.Her voice shines in this song. Awesome video too about reincarnation.<br />This is the best album i have ever purchased and will remain in my cd player for many years to come. Britney will probably become the next madonna if she reinvents herself and makes good music. Britney will be in this music industry/business for a long time!!
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Big Fish is one of the most wonderful character studies I have ever witnessed.  Albert Finney is marvelous as a story teller who's stories contain magic and wonder for his son, and always leave you wondering how much truth they contain.  The true art of story telling seems to have disappeared in our fast-paced, we-want-it-now world.  This incredible movie takes you back to the days when fathers held their child's interest by just relating his past.  But how much is true?  Only the most wonderful ending will let you know.  I cannot recommend this movie any  higher.  Every father should watch it with his son or daughter.  It will make both of you laugh, wonder, and cry.
B00000I3JO|4.0|Paul Buchanon and crew worked extremely hard to produce their masterpiece, &quot;Hats&quot;.  The long production really shows with this album's pitch-perfect tones and flawless execution.<br />  &quot;Hats&quot; is a special album, because it harnesses a mood few artists have ever been able to capture successfully.  Like the great writings of F. Scott Fitzgerald and the works of Tom Waits, the Blue Nile set a time and place that feels like perpetual twilight as hope, ambition and love frantically run amok in a beautiful if usually empty urban landscape.  Buchanon's thoughts of work, love and frustration are a true original, and have never been equaled by any artist.<br />  The album's opener, &quot;Over the Hillside&quot; sets the groove for the album's shifty moods and following it, &quot;The Downtown Lights&quot; really plunges you into the album's starry, neon-lit atmosphere.  After the triumphant final tracks, &quot;Hats&quot; leaves the listener with a calm, reassuring satisfaction that everything is alright.<br />  Anyone who's ever been in love with someone in the city will surely identify with the album's perpetual feeling of a dieing down night and the longing for someone to make it complete.
B000002LQR|4.0|most of these songs are throwaways, but the 4 hits are so good, the album deserves at least 4 stars.<br />1. The power of equality<BR>boring verses followed by more boring choruses.  6/10<br />2. If you have to ask<BR>a little neater than track 1, but still mediocre.  7/10<br />3. Breaking the girl<BR>absolutely amazing; this song begs for you to skip tracks 1 and 2.  10/10<br />4. Funky monks<BR>cool guitar; not so bad.  7/10<br />5. Suck my kiss<BR>alright!  10/10<br />6. I could have lied<BR>the verses are good, and then the song turns into a very very bad ripoff of \\"soul 2 squeeze\\" (rhcp's best song).  i can't even listen to this song.  0/10<br />7. Mellowship slinky in B Major<BR>i like the chorus, but the verses are a bad ripoff of track 2. 7/10<br />8. The righteous and the wicked<BR>the chorus in this one is pretty good too.  7/10<br />9. Give it away<BR>10/10.<br />10. Blood sugar sex magik<BR>yawn *skip*.  6/10<br />11. Under the bridge<BR>do i really have to say anything?  10/10<br />12.

The greeting song<BR>there's really no reason for this song to exist.  6/10<br />15. My lovely man<BR>i don't remember how this one goes, but i'm gonna go ahead and give it a 7/10, because it must not have been too bad or too good if i can't remember it<br />16. Sir psycho sexy<BR>this one's kinda cool.  7/10<br />what the album could (should) have been:<br />1. breaking the girl<BR>2. suck my kiss<BR>3. soul 2 squeeze<BR>4. give it away<BR>5. under the bridge<BR>6. apache rose peacock<BR>7. aeroplane<BR>8. my friends<BR>9. walkabout<BR>10. tearjerker<br />now that's a 5 star album!<br />but if you want 4 great songs, a few songs you might like a little, and a bunch of songs you'll skip over every time you play the cd, pick up this album (and go ahead and get \\"one hot minute\\" too); but if you're looking for some overall great rhcp albums, go with \\"californication\\" and \\"by the way\\"
B000006NPY|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins have always been a band that I've known of and been able to recognize on the radio (how could you not?) but I never truly &quot;got into&quot; them. However, after hearing &quot;Thirty-three&quot; (from &quot;Mellon Collie&quot;) on the radio, I finally said, &quot;Okay, I have to listen to these people.&quot; Over the past few days, I've listened to all of the Smashing Pumpkins' major studio releases. Based on my impression of them, I have to say &quot;Adore&quot; is my favorite. I don't understand why it was poorly received, both by fans and critics, when it came out. It shows a huge step both forward both musically (for the Pumpkins as a whole) and lyrically (for Billy Corgan). It shows far much more ambition than &quot;Mellon Collie&quot; -- ask yourself, how many alternative bands would attempt to make an album without a drummer? But they attempted and they pulled it off beautifully.<br />The album opens with the absolutely gorgeous &quot;To Sheila&quot; -- I knew from the first notes that I was going to love the album. It's followed by the electronically-driven and -- dare I say -- catchy &quot;Ava Adore.&quot; The two opening songs do what opening songs should do -- they set the tone for the album, as the rest of the album is full of electronics and beautiful piano-driven songs. Don't worry, the guitar isn't absent -- it's still there, it's just not the overpowering force it once was. It blends easily here. Beyond the opening tracks, some standouts are &quot;Daphne Descends,&quot; &quot;Annie-Dog,&quot; &quot;Blank Page,&quot; and &quot;For Martha,&quot; Billy Corgan's tearjerking tribute to his deceased mother.<br />&quot;Adore&quot; proves the musical genius of Billy Corgan. Only a genius could blend all of these noises and come up with the product that he came up with. As I said before, his lyrics also improve with this album -- it's almost as if he stops trying so hard and just lets it come out exactly how he's feeling it (&quot;it&quot; being his mother's death, his divorce, the reunion with his father, etc.). Perhaps that's why I love &quot;Adore&quot; so much -- it's a work of pure emotion, emotion conveyed so well through both the words and the instruments. Don't let yourself be fooled by fans and critics telling you the album isn't &quot;hard&quot; enough -- pick up &quot;Adore,&quot; put aside all other influences, and just revel in its beauty.

B00005JKN9|3.0|This is one of those mundane movies that shoots for the stars at every turn but never really gets off the ground. God's and Generals, The Last Samurai, it's in the same boat as them.     Gangs of New York portrays a little known era of American history, the Union during the Civil War. In the history books the North is often shown as a quaint, upper-crust society, intolerant of the bigotry in the south. GONY paints quite a different picture, the spirit of racism and violence very much thriving in the Northern states.     So that's where and when the movie takes place. Beyond that, I can't tell you what it's about. It's really several movies in one and there isn't a clear plot. The characters are very deep, but that's the problem; their motives seem constantly shifting and undisclosed to us, so they are really hard to relate to. We rarely know what the main character, Amersterdam played by Leo Di Caprio, is thinking, feeling, or scheming. I don't mind him being cast in this role, as others have complained. I just think a pretty shoddy script didn't give him any avenues to act.    Daniel Day Lewis, on the other hand, is very well cast and does shine through a thick, fake New York accent. Now, I'm not a historian, but did New Yorkers in the 1800s really talk with the same accent that they do today? It's hard to believe. Add on the fact that absolutely nobody else in the cast talks this way and Lewis sticks out like a sore thumb, a complete anachronism in an otherwise ambitiously portrayed historical account.     I don't really want to go into the specifics of what the story was about - poverty, street gangs, crooked politicians, avenging family members, etc. - but more how they went about it. It really felt like a, well...sort of a high school drama production. Everyone was overacting to an almost embarrassing level, and very few of the actors were of native Irish-dialect, so it was mostly fake accents. This just gives the film and others like it (Far and Away) a reallyinconsistent feel, since people who are supposed to be from the same social class and country speak entirely different from one another. And the costumes were, in my opinion, terrible. Many reviewers have been gushing over them. I guess all they need is a top-hat and a cane to be convinced of good \\"era\\" wardrobe. It was so overdone - like everything about this movie - that it stood out. Wardrobe is supposed to blend into the movie seamlessly, so that you don't even notice it. In fact, I think if the costume designer has done a good job, you won't even notice that the costumes were great. The fact that so many people feel the need to mention how amazing the costumes were is testimony to how much they stood out. Whether we like it or not, we viewers already have an image in our minds of how an era looks. Throw in too many details and we start paying attention to them and of course, it will clash with what's in our heads no matter how authentic the costume/set designer thinks it is, and thus it becomes \\"fake\\" looking. Put it this way - the costumes? They *looked* like costumes. The sets? They *looked* like sets. It didn't look like a movie, it looked like a poorly constructed play. Despite how \\"authentic\\" it might've really been, the entire thing looked fictional, sort of what Tim Burton might've done if he were directing.     The most memorable thing about the movie for me was that not only did they split it up onto two DVDs, they chose to edit the cut in the middle of a sex scene. Is that not odd? I mean, that might be the worst possible place you could do an edit. Not only should this not have been on two DVDs (it could've been put together on one in a smarter way to avoid this), but there is literally almost no worse place in the film to cut than in the center of a love scene. At the end of disc one Leo and Cameron Diaz are mostly naked. Black screen. Beginning of disc two, Daniel Day Lewis lays on a bed with three naked women. Random? Yes.     I don't recommend this movie, for any reason. The acting is so-so, the script is terrible, the plot is too thin to really get a grasp on, and the characters are so reclusive to the audience that we don't connect on any level - add to this an epic length and it gets even worse. If you just watch Titanic, Last of the Mohicans, and Being John Malchovich instead of this, you'll actually spend about the same amount of time and see the three stars playing essentially the same character in much better movies.
0920668372|5.0|This is a short and sweet story that captures the parent/child bond of love. It brings a tear to my eye every time I read it. It runs along the same line as \\"The Giving Tree\\" and makes a great Mother's day gift.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is perhaps the best soundtrack ever made.  It is a stunning mix of mostly acoustic tracks by most of the best bluegrass artists ever.  There is work on here from Ralph Stanely, Allison Kraus, and Emmelou Harris, to name a few.  This CD won a lot of Grammys the year that it came out, and that is because it was the best CD of that year.<br />Highlights include the Big Rock Candy Mountains, Man of Constant Sorrow, In the Jailhouse Now and O Death.  If you have ever wondered what bluegrass sounded like but have been afraid to try, this is the CD for you.  It will show you the magic that this genre of music can provide.

038533348X|5.0|I speak such powerful words of the author in the title above because I am a tremendously devoted fan of his. His thought process and ability to write such imaginative and complex fiction baffles me.<br />In Cat's Cradle, the main character named Jonah, begins to write a book aptly titled The Day The World Ended. He begins researching the book, and as he travels on his journey to complete the book (or perhaps to find answers to himself or life), he becomes a convert to a thought-provoking religion that proudly proclames its falsity and was written entirely by a calypso singer. He also expericences love, death, the drawback to power, and the erradication of mankind by a small substance known as Ice-9.<br />I reccommend that everybody read this novel! It may just change your perspective on things!

I don't know if it was that cheap costume, the jokes, or the fact that it's amazingly not scary, Scream is a falire. If you want to be scared, go see Halloween. Speaking of Halloween, I was hoping that Michael Myers would come and beat up the killer in this film by the end.
0316666343|5.0|From the moment I picked the book up at the store - I could not put it down.  It is very well written and a true gem to read.  Although it begins with such tragic details, you are captured immediately by the story to continue reading.  I highly recommend it!
0060263857|5.0|I must confess that having just read \\"Animal Farm\\" shortly before reading this book, I was a little hesitant about excepting this as a pure children's story without any hidden political agenda.  I kept expecting the talking animals to rise up behind the pig and take over the farm.  Rest assured however there was none of that, as E.B. White does a good job of keeping the story at a purely kids level.<br />Wilber is the runt in a litter of pigs, and Mr. Arable the farmer is going to take him out back and have him slaughtered since as he says, \\"He is small and weak and will never amount to anything.\\"  His young daughter Fern who is eight, hears this and requests that her father give the pig to her to raise instead.  The father wishing to prove a point to her, allows this so long as she promises to do all the work to take care of it.  To Mr. Arable's surprise Fern does an excellent job of raising Wilber and he turns out to be \\"Some Pig\\", proving that even though he was very small he still could amount to something.<br />As Wilber grows bigger the Arable's can no longer support feeding him, so Mr. Arable has Fern sell Wilber to her uncle Mr. Zuckerman who has a farm down the road.  There she goes and visits Wilber every day.  Being young I guess gives you the ability to sit and listen to the animals more intently than adults, and by doing so Fern is able to hear that the animals can actually talk and she understands them.  (Being the father of two girls who are 7 and 5, I'd have to disagree somewhat with this logic as my girls never sit still, and certainly have a hard time listening at times, but for the sake of the story we'll just give them the benefit of the doubt.)<br />Anywise Wilber meets all the other animals in the barn who are very nice, but none of them are really his close friend.  He becomes lonely and wishes for a friend.  A gray spider named Charlotte answers his prayers and after introducing herself, she becomes Wilber's best friend.<br />When the other animals tell Wilber that Mr. Zuckerman is just fatting him up to eat him for Christmas, this makes him greatly disturbed.  Charlotte being a great friend promises to do all she can to make Wilber so important to Mr. Zuckerman that he would change his mind.  She sets a plan in action to weave messages into her web proclaiming how great the pig is, and by doing so she hopes to trick the adults into believing it as well.  With the help of Templeton the rat she obtains some newspaper clippings and begins her work.<br />Each new message in the web is looked upon as miracle, but rather than looking for any religious connection, the folks in the town just believe they have a very famous pig on their hands and accept it at face value.<br />The suspense builds as Zuckerman takes Wilber to the Fair.  If he can just win an award there, Charlotte knows his life will be saved.  Charlotte and Templeton have to stow away in Wilber's crate just to accompany him to the Fair, and then when they get there the pig in the stall next to Wilber is twice as big and looks to be a shoe in for first prize.<br />This book was obviously written at a much simpler time in history.  At the Fair grounds the adults send the kids off on their own.  Besides Fern who is 8, she has a little brother Avery who is only 5.  After giving them all kinds of warnings such as not to eat too much, and to stay out of the sun, to not get dirty, and to be careful on the rides, the mother stops and says to the husband, \\"Do you think they'll be all right?\\" and he responds, \\"Well they have to grow up sometime.\\"  (None of the warnings were about staying away from strangers.)  Of course when the kids returned they hadn't stayed out of the sun and were hot, and completely dirty, but they had fun.<br />Fern meets a boy at the Fair, and starts to grow up a bit as playing with him starts to seem like more fun than talking to bunch of animals.<br />It is a great book about overcoming obstacles even though you are very small, growing up, and most of all friendship.  My girls loved the book as well, and especially seemed to like the illustrations by Garth Williams.l, growing up, and most of all friendship.  My girls loved the book as well, and especially seemed to like the illustrations by Garth Williams.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|well the first time i listened 2 this CD I was a lil unsure if i liked it... i mean 2 me it seemed so much more different than the sk8er girl, &quot;complicated&quot; person avril lavigne was in her first album.  But after another listen i learned 2 love most of the songs... except i have 2 say that i find the lyrics 2 track five annoying and stupid (how does it feel 2 be differnet from me? are we the same? *?*)but otherwise its a really great CD, i love tracks 1,2,6,7,8,10 &amp; i guess 12 the best. i suggest that avril fans should buy this CD of course, and even if you didnt find Let Go to be the greatest CD and hated her music in the first place u should try this album because it shows a more mature side and the music has progressed 2 a more powerful level. <BR>peace,<BR>a 13 yr old reviewer :-)

0066620996|3.0|Collins does a great job of displaying the direct results of leadership decisions and character on big business. The book is insightful and well written. There are several assumptions however, for instance: that the reader's desire is to build a big business like Nucor or Walgreens. The book also assumes that the corporate climate of the last 50 or so years will continue into the future. The basic premise of the book seems to be passionate non-diversification. I think this book is helpful but should be balanced with a counter-perspective such as Tom Peters' &quot;Re-imagine.&quot; The right answer is likely a little of both.<BR>There is also somewhat of a disconnect (particularly in the audio version of the book) between Collins' dedication to empirical evidence and his passionate presentation of the results as being right. The results of what caused these 11 companies to meet Collins' standards are presented as universally correct with almost moral absolution. This makes it seem less scientific than it claims to be.
B00005RFQ5|3.0|I was so far, so pleased with 'Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic' that, thinking that Prince had returned from the odd place he'd been, I bought this CD the first week it was out.<br />I popped it in my tray.  Listened, cringing most of the time, to track 1 and 2.  I almost made it through track 3 and gave up.  The CD was replaced in its beautiful packaging and placed on the rack.<br />In the meantime, the 'Symbol' CD, Rave... & Grafitti Bridge found their playtime along with 1999 and Sign O' the Times.<br />A year later, I pulled Rainbow Children out and tried again.  1...  2...  It had to go.<br />Mind you, Prince will drive you mad.  He can be the most amazing muscian -- crafting a piece of Pop magic or taking his turn at a genre that makes it his own -- like the jazzy \\"Strollin'\\" or the rocking \\"America\\".  How could the same person responsible for \\"Man-O-War\\" and \\"...Never Take the Place of Your Man\\" be so inept at putting lyrics to some of the most incredible music that he'd ever composed?<br />I couldn't throw it away, though, and \\"Rainbow Children\\" continued to languish unplayed, unrespected.<br />The day after I got home from witnessing Prince take over The Staples Center with his Musicology, I pulled out  The Rainbow Children again and FORCED myself to listen to it all the way through.  Good God, the lyrics are mostly bad; but, after I managed to block out the deep voice that he felt compelled to mar some of the tracks with, I found that I really enjoyed the listen.<br />Ignore the lyrics; embrace the music.  Prince is the most talented musician of, like, all time.  Got that?  Musician!
B0001ZX0PG|5.0|The backdrop of \\"Mystic River\\" is a crime story that serves as a character study. It is not the sort of crime story where the consummation of justice is the movie's drive. Who is the murderer is not the question that prompts the movie forward but it is our inquisitive notion for the character's behavioral process that keeps our mind churning. <br />Based on the novel by Dennis Lehane and adapted by Brian Helgeland, it tells the story of three childhood friends who will forever retain a traumatic memory of the abduction and sexual abuse of one of them. Jimmy, Sean, and Dave will never forget that bleak day in an Irish neighborhood in Boston when two men impersonating as cops apprehends Dave into their vehicle after they witness the boys violating public property. Keeping Dave in a secluded area in a forest, we get the hint that he has been sexually abused until the day he escapes. This is the first crime that we our witness to. This crime of the past will cause a ripple that will alter the perception of these characters.<br />\\"Mystic River\\" soars in many levels but with a few minor drawbacks. It is forgivable because they do not encompass the exceptional qualities of this film. The acting is exceptional, the suspense is there, it is Eastwood's best film since \\"Unforgiven,\\" it is a fervent film, it is a low-budget film that thrives on quality, and it has garnered many positive reviews from critics. Movies cannot get as well rounded as \\"Mystic River.\\" <BR>-(...)
B00006950W|1.0|Oh man, I don't even know where to start with this review. <BR>First of, I should say, that Resident Evil is another botched attempt by a movie company (Screen Gems) to bring <BR>another game title to the bring screen. <BR>All movies based on game titles have sucked :Final Fantasy, <BR>Mortal Kombat are just 2 examples.  In fact, the same idiotic director who made those terrible  Mortal Kombat movies directed this piece of junk!!! <br />Once I knew that, I knew the movie was going to suck. <BR>I just didn't how much it would suck, until I saw it. <BR>After seeing it, I have to say that Capcom did  probably the most stupidest thing they could have done, by giving the rights for this movie to be made. <br />Furthermore, Capcom, obviously didn't care,  how the director was going to follow the game, because if they had, they would have seen that the film does  horrible injustice to the game. <BR>It does not follow up the story and plot to the games. <BR>In fact, none of the characters from the game:  Chris Redfield, Claire Redfill, Jill, or Leon, the policeman are in the film. <BR>To understand why Resident Evil is a pitiful attempt <BR>to bring the game to the screen, you have to know the <BR>story in Resident Evil games. <br />An evil corporation called Umbrella, has unwilligenly <BR>or willingly (depending on who you ask) has unleashed <BR>a virus called the \\"T virus\\".  The T virus has the effect, of killing people and then  making them zombies. <br />Even more scary is the fact, that the Umbrella knows <BR>about the situation but is covering it up. Only a  handful of corrupt politicians and Umbrella  personnel know about the virus.  In the first RE game, a team of special police  officers, trace the roots of the virus to a mansion,  harboring all sorts of monsters.  In fact, \\"the scene of the mansion\\" is in the movie,  but that's one of a few similiarities  between the game and the movie.  Eventually the last survivors of the mansion Chris  Redfield, Jill Valentineescape only to be separated . (...) <br />Birkin is himself infected, by a more powerful virus, <BR>and is mutated to another horrible beast.  Eventually all the survivors escape, and thus  stop the Umbrella corporation from doing more damage  to Racoon City. <br />That's basically the Re games.  Sounds cool,doesn't it? <br />The Crappy, Sucky Movie version of Resident Evil <br />The movie starts out in the Umbrella Corporation. <BR>Everthing is calm and cool, until an employee drops a <BR>chemical container containing the T virus into the <BR>floor.  Then all hell breaks loose, because it seems that <BR>Umbrella's computer known as the Red Queen, has isolated and <BR>captured all of Umbrella's employees and plans to kill them. <BR>In fact, some of the death scene in Re are actually <BR>pretty good, but most of them are not.  So eventually most of the people in Umbrella die, due  to this supercomputer. LOL. <BR>This is garbage that is made up. In the Re games, <BR>there is no \\"Red Queen\\" that is causing the killing in <BR>Racoon City, and in Umbrella. The killing is brought <BR>upon by the heads of Umbrella, and corrupt politicians, who have knowingly released the virus and are trying to cover <BR>it up.   Instead, we get Milla Jolladovich, playing some drugged out,security officer named Alice Prospero. <BR>Then comes the ridiculous plot of the movie, which is that <BR>most of the damage inflicted on the personnel of Umbrella, <BR>is by a computer called \\"The Red Queen\\" which <BR>unleashes a set of death traps, to anyone infected with <BR>the \\"T virus\\". <br />Practically the only part of the game that the movie <BR>stays true to is in fact that Umbrella has created a virus called the \\"T virus\\" which it plans to use for germ warfare. <BR>However, that's how close you'll come to similiarities once again between the game and the movie. <br />Eventually Ms. Prospero is rescued, (technically she <BR>is put in the custody) of a group of special police cops , <BR>to infiltrate Umbrella and find out what the hell is going on. <br />Adding more confusion (and laughter) to the situation <BR>is that Ms. Prospero has amnesia and doesn't  understand her connection to Umbrella.   Well it's revealed that Ms. Prospero was working with someone in Umbrella, to expose to the media the virus  that Umbrella was creating. <br />However, that person died, along with the evidence that <BR>Umbrella is responsible for the chaos in Racoon City and <BR>Umbrella. <br />Eventually these bumbling cops eventually meet a holographic <BR>image of the Red Queen who says \\"I've been a very bad girl\\". <br />LOL. Yeah and I would have added \\"I've been a bad actress <BR>to be in this film too\\". <br />Eventually the remaining cops become aware of the zombies and other monsters and try to escape from Umbrella headquarters.... <br />Besides the terrible acting, script and story in Resident Evil, there is also a lack of creatures from the games. <br />The zombies , zombie dogs, and lickers are in R.E. but <BR>here is a whole of creatures and monsters not in the movie: <br />Giant, poisonous spiders,  killer sharks, 2 arm ferocious hunters, large killer poisonous plants and the over 6ft tall indestructible Tyrants in the game. A waste of a golden opportunity to make a good movie.

B00020HEL6|5.0|This CD was brought to me to listen to and I immediately ordered it.  Renee is incredible and I think she will be a huge singing star if she gets the right agent/promoter.  I did not have a clue that she sang, though I do watch Still Standing,it wasn't until a week or two ago that I heard her sing on the show.  I had no idea that she had any CD's on the market.  Jay Leno should pick her up and put her on his show - she certainly deserves the exposure and recognition for a great sound.  I also got a copy of this CD for my mother who (because she is 81) loved all the old tunes and was also amazed when I told her how old Renee was.  Not only does Renee have this natural easy flowing voice, but I love her range.  I am blown away by her.

The human story lines - both main and secondary characters - are very real and genuine, filled with honest emotion. Say what you will about Grisham, but this book is most authentic in its depiction of how these events would (and probably did in the past) unfold - he nailed it. The &quot;feel&quot; of the book reminds me of the strength he demonstrated in &quot;Painted House&quot; (an example of one of his books in which it appears the ending just stops abruptly without closure) in which I can still feel the swealtering heat of and Arkansas summer to this day. <br />Overall, I fiind this one of the better books I've read this season. A good read.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|This is a great show, but whoever is responsible for putting out the DVD put no effort into it at all (like the writers for the 4th season of the show).  There are essentially no extras except for a little junk on the last disc.  And the &quot;chapter&quot; breaks are few and far between.  For a great tv show AND a great dvd, check out Freaks and Geeks.
B00005CCA9|4.0|Okay, I'm not adept at the classical music critic's &quot;lingo&quot; and so can't and won't go on about all the technical aspects of Argergich's performance.  Certainly her virtuosity and speed in some passages was impressive, but missing from much of the performance for me was a sense of musicality.  I did not feel moved by her performance as I did with Kissin.  For those who want a performance that conveys more feeling and emotion, go with Kissin's performance.  If you want speed and flash, get this one.
B0000633T6|1.0|Yet another movie in which Robert Redford gets to reprise his role as an irritating know-all. He has played pretty much the same character for the last ten years, and this time the phoney sagacity emerges though the persona of a CIA commander handing out lines like 'don't ever question my orders again', 'you just lost ten seconds', and (yes) 'you're ten minutes late' to his fawning understrapper Brad Pitt. Yawn. Actually wasn't that last line followed by another admonitory clich? seconds later? Oh yes: 'Don't let it happen again.' By the way, this movie *is* marketed as a thriller.<br />How behind the times is a film which still tries to portray the embattled North Vietnamese as an enemy requiring murderous force to extirpate? How confused is a movie in which Redford refers in one moment to the 'seventeen sects' in Lebanon and thereafter has to use the cumbersomely neutral locution of 'the Lebanese militia' to refer to the sect the US had sided with? How cliched is a movie which intercuts between a tuxedoed reception at an embassy and a gritty car-chase behind the iron curtain? Plus the enemy du jour is - surprise, surprise - the Chinese.<br />The moviemakers' meticulous research and attention to detail is evdient throughout: Redford repeatedly pronounces Sheik as 'chic'; a scene opens with a shot of the Szabads?g bridge in Budapest while the subtitle reads 'Berlin'; and of course stealing top-secret documents at Langley is simply a matter of distracting the secretary, swiping them off his desk and hiding them under your jacket.<br />But I suppose you could just watch it for the garbled morals, the inapposite techno/dance soundtrack and director Tony Scott's frenetic swoop-then-freezeframe camerawork...
0141301066|5.0|Originally published in 1988, \\"Matilda\\" was one of the last books author Roald Dahl wrote before his death in 1990.  Most authors as they age become more cynical and dour.  Think of the final writings of Dickens or Twain and how bitter they seemed in their late years.  Then look at \\"Matilda\\".  Here we have a sweet charming little piece of literature about a girl that is both good and interesting.  Creating characters that you identify intrinsically with is not only difficult but (in children's books) sometimes near impossible.  Reading \\"Matilda\\", it becomes clear that Roald Dahl never lost his touch for creating wonderful original characters and situations.<br /><br />The heroine of this little book also carries its name.  Matilda is incredibly intelligent, even as a small child.  Living with her boorish parents and oblivious brother, she teaches herself to read from the various magazine and newspapers lying about the house. Her parents are completely indifferent to their only daughter and it is only by playing small tricks on them when they've been particularly nasty that little Matilda is able to keep a hold on her sanity.  By age five and a half Matilda has read all the children's books in the library and quite a few of the adult ones as well.  On entering school for the first time, our protagonist comes face to face with a very worthy enemy.  The Head Teacher, Miss Trunchbull, is the worst kind of dangerous violent adult.  It is only through Matilda's cleverness that she is able to come to the aid of her teacher, Miss Honey, and save the school from the Trunchbull's insanity.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Matilda is just the nicest kid ever.  Intelligent without ever becoming pig-headed.  Nice without becomes precious.  She's just a swell child all around.  Through her, Dahl takes some mighty fine cracks as his fellow kiddie lit authors.  I was especially fond of the portion in which Matilda points out that though C.S. Lewis and Tolkien are fine writers, \\"There aren't many funny bits\\".  And as we all know, Dahl is the master of the funny bit for kids.  This book is chock full of them too.  It contains all the usual peculiar Dahl touches (like kids being swung out of the playground by their pigtails) as well as practical jokes and nasty adults.  The Trunchbull is perhaps THE nastiest adult ever to grace the pages of the Dahl world.  Definitely unhinged, she abuses the children around her, coming just shy of actual physical contact.  It is amazing then that Dahl doesn't dispatch of her in a violent or crazy fashion.  She merely...disappears.  Likewise Matilda's parents get their comeuppance by merely fleeing the country to Spain.  Dahl was quite soft in his old age, it seems.<br /><br />Reading this book today I was struck by how much Lemony Snicket owes to Mr. Dahl.  Not just the usual adults-are-nasty-cruel-and-possibly-batty take, but the narrative voice as well.  It took me a couple minutes to realize that this was Dahl talking and not Mr. Handler.  Illustrated by Quentin Blake, the book is perfectly complimented by the illustrators' insane imaginings and concoctions.  The Blake/Dahl pairing is often inspired, and it works to its best advantage here.  I can't imagine this book without Blake's particular little pointy nosed heroine gracing the pages.  For those parents who either don't approve of Dahl or just don't \\"get\\" him, I think \\"Matilda\\" is the perfect story to win them over.  You'd have to be pretty hard of heart not to love its little heroine and the troubles she gets into.  A charming treat to be enjoyed for years to come.en't many funny bits\\".

B00004RFFI|5.0|For the people who don't like the plot or the acting, I must imagine you have never been a storm chaser, or anything remotely like it.  Been there, done that, these actors got the personalities down to a T. <br />If you like special effects, a little adventure, camaraderie, and a feeling of pursuing what you believe in, and can overlook some of the stupidity (that real life people have) of walking into a tornado, it's a great movie.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I'm with the millions of other people who are mourning Creed's breakup and eagerly awaiting the release of &amp;amp;quot;One Day Remains&amp;amp;quot; by Alter Bridge, essentially Creed minus Scott Stapp. I won't get into Pearl Jam vs. Creed because a couple hundred people before me were trading reviews about this...   This is the best Creed album, proven through it's instant ascent to the top of the charts upon its release. The heavy songs in the first half of the album, Are You Ready? through Wrong Way are deep and forboding, and the distortion on the guitars and lyrics fit very accordingly. In the latter half, Creed spreads its arms wide open and plays/sings with anthemic style that sports the most catchy guitar riffs I've ever heard.   I've only been introduced to Creed recently by a friend at school, I had my own doubts at first, because the only bearable songs for first-timers are the radio-ready songs &amp;amp;quot;Higher&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;With Arms Wide Open.&amp;amp;quot; However, as I listened to it more, the other songs became more appealing and I got the other two disks.   I was disappointed that Creed broke up only several months after I got into its music, but I'm awaiting the arrival of Alter Bridge. Creed isn't finished yet.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Wow, I mean WOW! Avrils new CD is the greatest! I like it because it gives me the guts to stand up for myself, or gives me the guts to say something to my boyfriend. I really love her CD! She expresses herself a whole bunch. For all those people who haven't herd any of her songs on her new CD, you need to. Some of them explain what she experiences and what she has to go threw in life. Well I really love her CD, you'll never get board of it, even if you listen to it a million times! Its great, its more then great it incredible!
B000002MTU|5.0|I have to recommend this cd to ANYONE that is interested in listening to the blues and some RAW emotion displayed through music. This cd was one of the first that I ever listened to by Mr. Clapton along with TIME PIECES and UNPLUGGED. I thrived off of them. I wanted to learn more and branched off to other genres of blues and jazz performed by artists such as BB KING and JELLY ROLL MORTON. This artist not only kept my interest alive but inspired me to LEARN about the culture of this type of music as well as enjoy it. I saw Mr. Clapton in concert tonight for the first time, and if you think this man does not know how to include SOUL, RYTHM, or BLUES into his music, you have never seen him live. From the time they unrolled his oriental rug on the stage, to the second standing ovation he received, it had to have undoubtedly be one of the best concerts I have ever seen. If you are a fan of the blues, you are a fan of Eric Clapton!
B000001Y42|1.0|Limp Bizkit sucks and so does Fred Durst, pathetic scum, this album is the worst, don't ever buy this disgrace of an album and music in general<br />okay now you say this review wasn't helpful to you at all
B000089RVX|2.0|The only thing that really sets Evanescence apart from other rock bands out there today is the use of female vocals.  While Amy Lee has an outstanding voice, that does not excuse the generic musical aspect of this CD.  Also, don't let the genre of this CD (labled as rock) fool you; only a few of the songs are really rock-oriented.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is probably the most over-played song on the radio, and it is no different than much of the bubblegum pop that is out there today.  If I am buying a rock CD, I expect most of the songs to have that hard edge to them, but most songs on &quot;Fallen&quot; simply do not.  It felt like I had purchased a CD from Brittney Spears!  The only decent (not necessarily good) songs on this CD are &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot;, which are both overplayed on the radio as it is.  While Evanescence is not as overrated as Linkin Park, rock fans will truely be dissapointed.  I hesitate to use the phrase &quot;nu-metal&quot; with Evanescence, because that implys that there is some sort of edge to the band's songs that, in some way, resembles metal, but of course, Evanescence does not have this edge.  If you are into soft-rock, this is a fairly decent buy.  If you are into hard-rock or metal, you'd be better off with Limp Bizkit (which is pretty pathetic, considering how annoying Fred Durst's vocals are and how extreme the incompetency of his band is).  This is not, by far, the worst radio band out there today (Smile Empty Soul, Trapt, and Linkin Park come to mind), but nothing to get excited over.

B00024BHTC|5.0|Breaking away from their earlier works (to a degree), Once contains more symphonic and instrumental metal as compared to earlier albums, such as Wishmaster or Oceanborn. Still, that doesn't mean that the music isn't as good - in my opinion, this is the best Nightwish album yet! US release won't be for awhile unfortunately, so import it if you can! WELL worth it!
B00003CXA2|5.0|&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; has to be one of Ton Hanks' best pictures he has ever produced. 1994 was difeinately his best year, when he won back-to-back awards for his role in &quot;Philidelphia&quot; and this. He plays a man, born in a place called Greenbow, Alabama. The film starts off with him sitting on a bench, waiting for a bus to meet his girlfriend. While he waits, he has a nice chat to people who pass by and he tells them about his life. That's when his story begins. Forrest (who he plays) is a very strange person and isn't very smart. But he becomes a war hero, top football player, ping-pong champion, shrimp fisherman and a whole lot more. But he also has deep feelings. He has a special someone that he is deeply in love with. Jenny.<br />Most of the time, the film concentrates on Forrest and Jenny. It shows how they meet, what they do together, how they split up, how they get back together etc. <br />The film is very touching, as it nears the end, but it also is very funny, with stupid things always occuring. It also contains some action when he is in Vietnam. The film has everything almost. The cast is excellent. I liked Gary Sinise as Forrest's caption in Nam. The beautiful Robin Wright played Jenny, and Sally Field played Forrest's helpful mother.<br />When you haven't a clue what type of movie to see, see this.
B000003TA4|5.0|but if AFI K can make 5 (or over) one-star reviews, i don't see why i can't make another 5-star review.  i'd just like to personally thank A music fan from somewhere. you took the words right out of my mouth. AFI K seriously needs to find something else to do in his spare time than posting &quot;reviews&quot; (they actually aren't reviews but rather lame attempts at dissing Nirvana) on CDs he probably hasn't even heard and is simply being biased.
B000002J2D|5.0|Genesis' third post-Gabriel outing with Phil Collins as lead singer of the group is a very transitional album where almost all of their progressive rock style is shed and the band reveals a much more accessible pop sound. Their biggest hit to date at this point was their 1978 charting single entitled &quot;Follow You Follow Me&quot; which is a really good pop single.<br /> This album at the same time still has a sort of wintery feel similar to their previous outing &quot;Wind and Wuthering&quot; but the sound of this album is much more accessible and easier to get into than their previous outings. In my perspective, this is their least progressive album they've ever made in their 30 year career. Even their more pop sounding 80s works had a more progressive style than &quot;Then There Were Three&quot;. &quot;The Burning Rope&quot; is the closest this album comes to being progressive but it's only a little over 7 minutes long but it's still a really good song.<br /> Not their best by any stretch of the imagination but ATTWT is arguably their transitional album where they went from prog rock and went totally pop and this has likely angered a lot of their audiences at this point but I feel like I'm the only one who loves almost everything they've done from Nursery Cryme to Invisible Touch and all the way to Calling All Stations.
B0001GF2DS|5.0|I had never seen this film. I saw several scenes in the middle and clips from commercials, but I had never really liked westerns, and, from what I understood, spaghetti weserns were the worst. When I finally decided to see this movie, I did so only as a means of sarcastic entertainment, the &quot;Plan 9&quot; syndrome. I was blown away.<br />Right from the first I realized how much of Leone's style was employed by my other favorite directors. I loved the comedy, action, and melodrama so much in fact, that when I compiled my Top Fifty, this masterpiece shot to a not too modest number two.<br />A recurring theme throughout the film is the concept of there being &quot;Two kinds of people in the world.&quot; This is an intrigueing concept to me because that statement is contradicted by the title and by the complexity of the many characters tthat appear throughout it. Things aren't limited to just good and bad, blue and gray, rich and poor. There are are many factors that go into each individual, and this is one of the things that makes the film so memorable.<br />The cinematagraphy is the best of any film I've ever seen. In the film are some of the best panoramas and close-ups including the Greatest single shot in history. (Orson Welles, eat your heart out!) I think Roger Ebert gave the best explanation when he discussed the limited perception of the camera and characters.<br />I do have a few quarrels with certain things they changed to extend it to its original Italian version. Though I wouldn't say this in most cases, the new dubbing should not have been done by the original actors. Their voices have changed so much that the new scenes sound dubbed by bad impersonators. In fact the best new dubbing was Lee Van Cleef's. He was the only actor who didn't do his own dubbing. Death can have that effect on your career.<br />Ultimately, this is not only the best western, but one of the best melodramas, comedies, war films, and one of the best films ever made! A very enthusiastic FIVE STARS!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|this is an excellent CD. It does take a few listens to get use to them but soon you'll like every song on here like me. I think every song is absolutely excellent on this CD. The more you listen the more you will like these guys. If you buy a Tool CD buy this one first.
078322611X|5.0|Field of Dreams is a movie that vibrates the heartstrings of millions of people, and this version with all of its extras is wonderful. It is hard to believe that it is not among The American Film Institute's 100 Best of All Time. I believe that it is more about the American philosopy of Transcendentalism than it is about baseball. It perfectly illustrates Henry David Thoreau's belief that we should march to the beat of our own drummer. It completely illustrates the Transcendentalist belief in living close to nature. After all, Ray began to hear his inner voice once he moved to the farm. I believe baseball symbolizes the Transcendentalist concept of Oversoul in the movie. Emerson and Thoreau believed that everything is connected to Oversoul; in the movie, everything is connected to baseball. In terms of the transcendentalists' reliance on intuition, what movie better shows its importance? Once Ray began to rely on his intuition, his life finally led to his reconciliation and healing with his father. The transcendentalists also believed in social responsibility. How wonderfully is this illustrated in the movie when Annie staunchly defended the 1st Amendenment at the school board meeting. Director Phil Alden Robinson created a classic movie because it taps into our true American psyche. It is perhaps the most spiritual of all secular movies. A gem.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|When I first heard the self titled Slipknot, I was all into it, listening to it every five minutes, but after a while, the screaming and the fast drums got boring.  Same with Iowa.  Very good songs, well done and great singing, but it was dull after about a month.<BR>   When I bought Subliminal Verses, i listened to it over and over and over (and over......) and I'm still not bored of it.<br />1. Prelude 3.0: great prelude, definatly better then the previous two.  This song was actually catchy to me  8/10<br />2. The Blister Exists: Although many of my friends disagree with me, I think that this is one of the better songs off the album.  It has an amazing drum solo in the middle and the end.. Chris and Clown are great drummers.  9.5/10<br />3. Three Nil: Dull to me at first, listening to it a second time was all it took for it to become my favorite song off the album  10/10<br />4. Duality: I once thought that this was the greatest Slipknot song, but it is so overplayed on the radio that now I find it boring  8.5/10<br />5. Opium of the People: Fast, brutal and amazing.  Although one of the shorter songs on the album (behind Welcome) it is still up there with the great songs  9.5/10<br />6. Circle: Not my favorite by a longshot  7/10<br />7. Welcome: I heard this song on a Slipknot website before the album came out and I found it a little on the boring side  8/10<br />8. Vermillion: From the chilling beginning to chilling end, this is probably one of the best on the album  10/10<br />9. Pulse of the Maggots: boringboringboringboring... but great  9/10<br />10. Before I Forget: I loved it for a while, but it grew dull  9/10<br />11. Vermillion Pt. 2: Better then Circle, though many disagree  8/10<br />12. The Nameless: GREAT SONG! Going from heavy to soft, and the heavy again, this is a great song with a great chorus  10/10<br />13. The Virus of Life: Freaky song.. left me with chills when I blasted it at 1 in the morning 9.5/10<br />14. Danger Keep Away: The weakestsong on the album by far  6/10
B00006879E|5.0|I can't even put into words how much I love this CD. I bought it and didn't listen to anything but this for like, 3 months. (Not to mention I made everyone I know listen to it, which made most of them go out and buy it.)<br />It's just so jazzy and funky, and ...everything. It's a little of everything. Just put this on and relax and sing, and it's.. great. Just WONDERFUL. Maroon 5 will be around for many CD's to come.<br />Ahh. <br />Buy it, NOW. You won't regret it.
0553573403|5.0|This book and the rest of its series are probably the best books I've ever read.  Unlike most fantacy books, these do not have a clear line between good and evil.  Both the &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;bad guys&quot; have their strenghts and their flaws, making the plot more probable and realistic.  I found myself staying up until 1:00 or 2:00 at night reading because I was just unable to put these books down.  I don't know if I could say which book in A Song of Ice and Fire is the best.  You will just have to read them all!  I give all of them five stars.

B000002JOH|5.0|I found out about Pantera from one of my metal obsessed friends.  He was all excited about finding a new metal band to listen to, so he kept bugging me to get a CD by them.  I finally gave in and bought Vulgar Display of Power.  It turns out that he had a right to love them<BR>    From the beginning to end, this album is raw metal.  Dimebag Darrel is definatly one of the greatest guitarists and Phil Anselmo's voice is still in its yelling, hoarse voice stage (compared to the Great Southern Trendkill screaming stage)<BR>    Some of the best songs on the album (Mouth For War, This Love, Walk, Rise) are the songs that brought this amazing metal album to the top.  My personal favorite is Rise.  It is so heavy and has many catchy riffs.<BR>    If you like this album, buy Far Beyond Driven, another of my favorites
0783116934|5.0|HBO has put out some very good and respectable original movies over the years.  Supergun, Path to War to name a few.  But this movie that chronicles Russian serial killer Andres Chikatilo's murder spree is without question the finest movie that HBO has ever made.  Sydow is the movie's standout....his performances are stunning throughout.  Sutherland also deserves special mention.<br />     Lets be absolutely clear about this.....this is an ADULTS ONLY movie....it has much disturbing content.  Put the kids to bed.....and be prepared for a chilling yet unforgettable movie.
B00004VVND|1.0|The beginning of this movie is wonderful.  The entire premise of an adult theme park manned by robots is very interesting, and the beginning of the film is effective.<br />Unfortunately, the end is painful to watch.  The movie degenerates from its strong beginning to a 20-minute chase scene between two characters.  20 excruciatingly boring minutes of walking/running through scenes cluttered with already dead people.  Yawn.
B000002UAF|5.0|Anyone who's seen the film won't forget the virtuoso musical sequences, from the fast cutting of the opening, with the four faces flashing before us as A Hard Day's Night kicks off, to the boys playing around in a field as the soundtrack blares Can't Buy Me Love and the aerial camera soars and dips. And the energy of those sequences are in the songs, which are the most professional and confident of the Beatles' career up to this point. This album's all Lennon-McCartney, start to finish, and remains the only pure Lennon-McCartney album in the Beatles canon (George would be chipping in soon). This was the Beatles at the peak of their powers at the peak of Beatlemania. Personally, I find this to be an album that grows on you rather than wows you right away (though I'm pretty much alone in that). That's because despite the rock and roll flair of the two singles (which you've probably heard before this album), there's a lot of more subtle material on here. The first few listens I didn't even register Things We Said Today until I realized it was one of the best songs here. The sound of the guitar on this is quite memorable. And I Love Her is a classic ballad, probably the most famous song after the singles, but so is If I Fell, John's touching (and confusing, if you listen to the lyrics) ode to a love he can't pursue. This, along with the title track and I Should Have Known Better, kick off the album with a grand start. Some of the songs on side 2 (especially the aforementioned Things We Said Today) are just as strong as the first 7 tracks, which were the ones included in the movie--though there's no doubt that side 1 is superior. But I'll Be Back, You Can't Do That, and Any Time at All are all catchy pop--and at this stage the Four were writing songs with the best of 'em in Tin Pan Alley. Soon of course they would move far beyond pure pop rock as a form and love as a subject, but this is the pinnacle of their earlier, more focused phase.<BR>5/6
B00004KD11|4.0|&quot;&quot;Shades Of Deep Purple&quot;&quot;, Deep Purple's first album, is a great one. It outsold the album that came after it, &quot;&quot;The Book Of Taliesyn&quot;&quot;. This album was recorded with Rod Evans on Vocals, Jon Lord on Keyboards, Ritchie Blackmore on Guitars, Nicky Simper on Bass, and Ian Paice on Drums. This lineup was the greatest Deep Purple lineup of all time. &quot;And The Address&quot; is Blackmore/Lord, &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Hush (Live US TV)&quot; are South, &quot;One More Rainy Day&quot; is Lord/Evans, &quot;Prelude:Happiness I'm So Glad&quot; is Lord/Evans/Simper/Blackmore and Skip James, &quot;Mandrake Root&quot;, &quot;Love Help Me&quot;, and &quot;Love Help Me (Instrumental Version)&quot; are Blackmore/Evans, &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Help (Alternate Take)&quot; are Lennon/McCartney&quot;, &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and &quot;Hey Joe (BBC Top Gear Session)&quot; are Roberts, and &quot;Shadows (Album Out Take)&quot; is Lord/Evans/Simper/Blackmore.<br />&quot;And The Address&quot; (4:38) (4/5): A trippy, psychedelic song with driving guitar and organ parts.<br />&quot;Hush&quot; (4:24) (5/5): What can one say about &quot;Hush&quot;? It is the best Deep Purple song of all time, the best song on this album, and the third-best Hard Rock song of all time. This is a cover of a song by Joe South. This song is where Deep Purple reached its absolute peak, proving that the Mark I Deep Purple lineup is the greatest of all Deep Purple lineups. This surpasses Joe South's version.<br />&quot;One More Rainy Day&quot; (3:39) (3/5): The second-worst song on the album. This song is a psychadelic/pop song. It's a bit slower than the first two songs on this album.<br />&quot;Prelude: Happiness I'm So Glad&quot; (7:19) (4/5): This song is a semi-cover of a song by Skip James, and the semi-cover surpasses the original. Becomes a rocking song later on.<br />&quot;Mandrake Root&quot; (6:09) (4/5): This song is underrated with a hard-rocking, bluesy riff.<br />&quot;Help&quot; (6:01) (4/5): This song is a cover of a song by The Beatles. This song is slower than the original song, and surpasses the original.<br />&quot;Love Help Me&quot; (3:49) (3/5): &quot;Love Help Me&quot; is the worst song on this album. It's another psychedelic/pop song. All in all, however, it's a very interesting song.<br />&quot;Hey Joe&quot; (7:33) (4/5): This song is a cover of a song by Billy Roberts. An extended instrumental sequence is added to the song, with the organ being the main instrument of this sequence. This version surpasses the original version.<br />&quot;Shadows (Album Out Take)&quot; (3:38) (4/5): This song is a studio outtake that never made it to the original vinyl version of &quot;&quot;Shades Of Deep Purple&quot;&quot;. The song is very addictive, especially the chorus.<br />&quot;Love Help Me (Instrumental Version)&quot; (3:29) (4/5): This song is a version of &quot;Love Help Me&quot; without the Vocals.<br />&quot;Help (Alternate Take)&quot; (5:23) (4/5): This song is an alternate take of &quot;Help&quot;, with the Vocals being different from &quot;Help&quot;.<br />&quot;Hey Joe (BBC Top Gear Session)&quot; (4:05) (4/5): This song is a &quot;BBC Top Gear Session&quot; version of &quot;Hey Joe&quot;. This version, however, does not have the extended instrumental sequence, with the Vocals being different from &quot;Hey Joe&quot;.<br />&quot;Hush (Live US TV)&quot; (3:53) (4/5): This song is a version of &quot;Hush&quot; played on &quot;Live US TV&quot;. The quality of sound in this version is awful. &quot;Hush (Live US TV)&quot; is shorter than &quot;Hush&quot;.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|I rented this movie awhile ago and to my suprise i found it very Well done and entertaining. Please dont listen to the &quot;Wanna be Historians&quot; who think they know everything about War and what took place in those times. They get theyre info from the same old men i get mine from, are &quot;Fathers &amp; Grandfathers.&quot; it may not be Accurate or it may very well be. But what does it matter i ask? The movie is entertaining and keeps your brain wanting to know more of the story line and plot. Why would you be watching this movie for history lessons... if you want that go to school, or find you a book. Also They do have a channel called the &quot;History&quot; channel that does provide some great &amp; accurate War Pictures and Movies. Please dont cast your negative thoughts on a good movie and spoil it for others just because you want a history lesson to go with it.
0393324818|4.0|Especially when you remind them that the Oakland A's have a higher historical winning percentage and do it with much less salary. How would you know that? You'd read this book.<br />Michael Lewis gives an interesting peek inside how small market baseball teams can save themselves in the era of big money dominance. Using non-traditional statistical analysis of ball players and ruthless honesty about baseball's &quot;conventional wisdom,&quot; A's GM Billy Beane turns baseball scouting on it's head.<br />The book is a bit melodramatic in places, but overall it is fun to read and very, very revealing. Stats geeks will be satisfied but the average reader is not overwhelmed by the material. I really enjoyed this book and it makes a great &quot;guy's beach book.&quot;
6305308659|4.0|I'm not really sure why I like this film....and that's one of the things I like! Weird.<br />Background - The hit 50's television show 'Pleasantville' is having an all night marathon. David Wagner (Tobey Maguire)intends to watch every episode. His sister Jennifer Wagner (Reese Witherspoon) intends to watch a concert with a new boy-toy. The two fight and are somehow transported inside the black and white show.<br />Story - The town of Pleasantville is a typical utopian vision from the 1950's. Everyone has a white picket fence, and the boys play basketball for the school team. When David's sister begins messing around with the balance in the town, things start to go awry.  The normally black and white town starts to become 'in living color'.<br />While many in the town fight the change to color, some accept it willingly. They want to change, and grow. The town begins to tear itself apart as the grey people and the colored people begin to fight. It harkens back to the 50's and 60's era with black and white race relations.<br />This is a good film that unfortunately, didn't get a any decent advertising when it was released. I think it's a bit of a cult classic that way. Most of the people who've seen it did so because of word of mouth. So take it from me, you should get this one.
630542845X|5.0|One thing that Powder brings to mind is that humanity has failed.  Humanity has been succumbed to insatible greed, violence, destruction, religious fundamentalism in a bid to have dominance, power and control over others, so insecure male supremacists can play people for fools while laughing all the way to the bank.  Most of the customers who gave this movie a bad review, are more or less likely to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and were angered by the movies' universal themes for they found their faults through Powder's character.  It is irrelevant whether or not \\"god\\" is simply energy that relays from live form to another.  The message in this movie is that humans before male supremacy were loving, caring, empathetic, sympathetic, open-minded, intellectuals whose values were not the least bid superficial or materialistic.  Their motives for being was working for leisure, living for pleasure, enjoying one another, laughing and loving and reflecting upon themselves and others around them.  People must take the time to connect with others as well as the universe and maybe then the human race will finally stumble OUT of the Dark Ages of which we still reside today.  Jerald Brockert wrote the best review of this movie and emphasized that those who feared this movie (as I have come to notice) are incredibly prejudiced and narrow-minded, and can only feel \\"superior\\" to others by destroying the lives of otehrs.  Powder represented what humanity was and what it should return to being.  Living for living.  I, personally, don't take any pleasure in destroying the lives of others and if you do, then I don't recommend you watch this film for you are the very evil that you feared most seeing reflected in this film.  Having suffered immense discrimination for my \\"liberal-minded\\" views, my being mixed-race, and being female as well, I can relate to Powder on every level of this film.  <br />All of the scenes were well-planned.  It was a pleasure to finally see de-sexualized womenas full human beings and not sex objects to be raped for the picking nor properties of men but contributors to human society.  Jeff Goldblum was outstanding as the science teacher.  Mary Steinburger, although having good intentions, still did not do what she thought best for Powder giving him a supposedly \\"adequate\\" home.<br />I believe that if you have the humanity and compassion, which most of us all lacking, to cry then you truly are human.  Those of us who are selfish, arrogant, and narrow-minded enough to think we are superior to others because of \\"what\\" we are as opposed to what one thinks, is a pathetic excuse of existence on Earth.  If we keep whining about violence, racism and prejudice then let's do something about it...eliminate it...if you're down with capitalism or supremacy of any RACE...then let Powder set the example that with compassion, empathy, and an \\"attached\\" vision with which to look at the world we can overcome all.  <br />Brilliant, stunning, captivating, and remarkably touching for those of us with even a little humanity inside.  Powder will remind us all that our technology has surpassed our humanity.  That in the end we are all connected to one another.  If you are MATURE, a FreeThinker, with your own sense of individuality, never longing to be oppressed by any ideology, or fundamentalist behavior (like our beloved Muslim terrorists or capitalist junkies) than liberate yourself, free your soul and try just being HUMAN for once in your life...<br />An eye-opener...Powder plays on your fears like Madonna plays on feminism.<br />I dedicate this movie to intellectuals, women, goths, gays, lesbians, Jews, political activists, children and those who dare to open their minds.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|This is a fantastic film. Perhaps the best western ever made. The acting is superb all around. The cinematrography is beautiful, and Charles Bronson is super cool. The opening sequence is incredible. This film is a must for any film buff. The special collector's edition is superb. My only complaint is the audio. Sergio Leone dubbed all his audio; as a result, some scenes are not synchronozied. Hence the four stars. Still, this is a minor flaw considering how well directed this film is.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This is one of my favorite Jim Carrey films.  It's not his usual comedy, but it's great nonetheless. In fact, I don't remember any comedy in this film at all!<br />Background - Peter Appleton (Carrey) is a 1950's Hollywood writer who takes a little road trip after losing his job. He gets into an accident and loses his memory. He wanders into a small town where he's mistaken for a town son who was killed in WWII. <br />Story - Appleton decides to help his 'dad' to reopen the old 'Majestic Theatre' in town.  Over the course of the film, his amnesia begins to wane and he starts to realize he's not who everyone thinks he is. This film goes into the communist trials of the 50's, and Carrey plays the character so well, it's hard to believe I'm watching Ace Ventura playing a normal guy. <br />This is probably my favorite of Carrey's dramas, and really showcases his wide talents as an actor. From romantic scenes, to tearjerkers, he does them all well, and most importantly, believably. Don't miss this one.
B000148KK2|4.0|I think Krall's fans were expecting something different, but Diana made us a surprise. This CD is less mellodic than her previous works and even more... &quot;jazzistic&quot;. She didn't took the risk of repeating herself, but forgot - perhaps purpously - to please general public. I believe that only jazz lovers can really enjoy this new album.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|this is a great collection and track order from gn'r. however they are missing one song that should be on here and that is why i gave it 4 stars. i would've gave it 5 if mr.brownstone was on here but who knows they might just make a greatest hits 2.  if they do make another greatest hits ill sure to raise the rating but for now ill keep it at a 4/5.  who knows they may make a gn'r greatest hits 2 like they did with &quot;use your illusion&quot;.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|Nice footage of modern Tokyo and Kyoto. And yes, it is hard to sleep when you first get to Japan from the U.S. because of the time difference, but overall, vacation footage,as far as I can tell. Bill Murray being Bill Murray.  How hard is that?  Good looking movie. A little naive regarding the Japanese people. Also, yes I would have liked to know what was said at the end, but that doesn't make it Academy Award material in my opinion.
B0001WTUH6|2.0|The two stars are only for the recently released Unrated Extended Version - not the original DVD. The original DVD is definitely ***** stars for me. Like a lot of people, if I really like a movie, I'll buy the Unrated Director's Cut because of all the extras. But in this case, the original is much better than the new version.<br />Let's compare. The first DVD has a great commentary by Len Wiseman (director), Danny McBride (screenplay), and Kevin Grevioux (storyline - he is also the huge Black guy with the incredible voice who plays a Lycan). They talk about how the three of them came up with the idea for this movie and how it got made. They also talk about how some of the scenes were done, information on the cast, the conditions under which they made the movie - no budget, major time constraints - and what it was like filming in Budapest, Hungary. It also has a technical commentary that I haven't listened to yet. On the other hand, the commentary for the extended cut is done by the director, Kate Beckinsale and Scott Speedman. This commentary's main subject was talking about Beckinsale's hair, compliments for Beckinsale by Wiseman (who is Beckinsale's husband or partner) and Speedman, teasing Speedman, and gushing over Michael Sheen (who was great as Lucien). There are no technical discussions and the only other cast member who is talked about for any length of time was Bill Nighy (Viktor, who was excellent). Half way through the commentary, Speedman leaves and then there's a bunch of chit chat between Wiseman and Beckensale about Speedman going off to make a movie with the Olson twins.<br />Wiseman also states a couple of times that this version is not a director's cut (are they going to release another DVD?). When he talks about added scenes, he points out which scenes he would have liked in the original theatrical release and the first DVD, and which scenes he wouldn't like to see back in the movie. If he didn't want certain scenes added then why are they in theextended cut? This newer version adds a scene where Michael (Speedman) talks about his past and how he ended up in Budapest, a storyline that adds a love affair between Erika and Craven, plus some added shots of Viktor with the apparatus that pumps blood into him. But there are also numerous and completely unnecesarry scenes of Lycans and Vampires going up and down stairways over and over, and just little shots of objects that are part of the set. In addition, there's absolutely NO reason to title this DVD as unrated, which implies that there are scenes that were deleted because of problems with the MPAA rating. I don't see how any of the added scenes could have pushed the MPAA to make this movie NC-17. I think that was just another ploy to get people to fork over more money for this version.<br />The only thing that I liked in the extended cut were some outtakes. But there weren't enough of them to make up for the additional money you'd have to pay for this cut.<br />To sum up, if you're a film geek who loves to listen to commentaries on the DVD, stick with the original DVD. If you don't care about that kind of stuff and you don't already own the original DVD, then it's up to you if you want to sit through a lot of unnecassary additons that the director didn't even like. But if you already have the first DVD, I would not recommend buying this version (unless you're dying to listen to Beckinsale complain endlessly about her hair).<br />The Extended Cut is NOT a director's cut - it just has extra scenes in it. Some of the scenes the director wanted in the movie and some of the scenes he didn't. How do I know this? - from listening to the commentary
B0001L3LUE|4.0|For some reason, I actually thought that Bob McNamara would come clean in this film.  The hope was that we would finally get an explanation about the Vietnam fiasco from one of its architects.  But life doesn't work so cleanly.  Things are more complicated than that.  And so he still hides behind that good ol' executive privilege.  <br />So instead we are treated to a philosphical discourse on how evil can masquerade as good intentions and misbegotten strategy.  Although the news media has trivialized the comparison, the hidden value of this film, then, is that it points out the lessons we are currently experiencing in Iraq.  Once again Santayana was correct: we relive other folks' mistakes over and over again, no matter how often we say &quot;I told you so.&quot;
B000000JO3|5.0|Excellent. Deep. Penetrating. Powerful. All of these words help descride Minor Threat. Straight out of Washington D.C, these guys certainly mean business. Minor Threat's song writting has become increasingly popular. Helping boost up the &quot;straight edge&quot; movement, which promoted non-violent and anti-drug/drinking rock concerts during the early 80's, Minor Threat set the stage for future rock bands. Their signature song entitles what other than, &quot;Striaght Edge&quot; talks about a healthy, anti-drug/alchohol life. With the F-word cranking from Ian's mouth every other line, MT pulls of their aggressive tone in this 46 second powerful rock song. Other excellent songs from the boys include &quot;12XU&quot;, &quot;Bottled Violence&quot;, Minor Threat&quot;, Seein' Red&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;Think Again.&quot; Ian McKaye's lyrical content is agressive and to the point. While Jeff Nelson's half-baked, but excellent drumming keeps the bands tone and tempo to a fast paced rockin' sound. Guitar riffs are catchy and the bass really stands out. Although the production of this particular (and only MT album) wasn't the best, who can complain about a heart-filled group of 4 guys who rocked the stage for todays hardcore bands. The music is pure and satisfying, should keep you listening for days on end. Overall Minor Threat helped found your Misfits, Virus, Operation Ivy, The Unseen, Offspring, and whatever other rock bands you like. What was once a Minor Threat that played at DC's infamous Nine-Thrity Club, has hit it huge and created an empire for today's band. So you can stop with all that &quot;I hate new rock bands!&quot; bull-shinikees, shut up and thank Minor Threat...<BR>                              -Andy A.
B000003TAL|5.0|listen: I am a sonic youth enthusiast, and I do NOT own all their albums. But I know this: I know good music when I hear it.  My first SY album was EVOL, which blew me away.  When I bought Sister, I was shocked at the different sound.  But when I bought DDN, even the change of sound between evol and sister could not prepare me for this blast of noisy beauty.  Combine the two tones of evol and sister and you get this: a warm, yet dark and slightly reverby guitar, powerfully booming drums (Id rather have the original version with the drums more upfront) and some of their best songwriting.  I have tried to write reviews for those songs numerous times, and Im just unable to describe how awesome they are.  Just buy this album.<br />highlights: Teenage Riot, Silver Rocket, Cross the Breeze, Candle, Rain King, Trilogy. but dont take my word for it, every song is epic.
B000063NPX|5.0|It is quite rare for any animated film to be treated with the same respect as any other honored non-animated one.  In BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, directors Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale take the time-worn fairy tale of the outwardly loathsome beast who impossibly enough allows his inner nobility to shine forth sufficiently to cause the beauty to fall in love with him.  Robby Benson is the voice of the Beast and Paige O'Hara is Beauty.  Even for those readers familiar with the spoken tale or the revamped music video with Meatloaf as the Beast cannot help but allow themselves to be entranced with the seamless melding of sight to sound.  The plot is simplicity itself with the Beast as the archetypal symbol of the rebirth of nobility long hidden by the evil spell of an unnamed wizard.  There is nothing childish in the unfolding of the tale of Belle the Beauty who chooses to sacrifice herself in marriage to save the life of her doddering inventor father. Enter the Beast who is initially presented as the roaring brute that his tormenting wizard clearly intended him to be.  Yet, as Belle ministers to his psychic wounds of self-loathing and his physical wounds incurred in defending her against a pack of wolves, the viewer can see a competing spell at work, one that is older than time itself--the power of love that the film's many songs allude to and function as as subtext that imbues it with timeless energy.  There is, of course, some needed plot complications of unwanted attention heaped on Belle by the handsome but warped Gaston, who plots to snare Belle in marriage as firmly as he would stalk a reindeer for its antlers.  As Gaston leads the villagers in an assault on the Beast's manor, one is reminded in reverse of the cliched villagers pounding at the walls of Doctor Frankenstein's castle, but in this case the attack in presented in comic tones that keep the real world of harm at bay.  <br />BEAUTY AND THE BEAST has no down moments, with each fresh plot advancement heralded bystunningly effective animation and song.  This film was a deserved nominee for Best Picture in 1991, and with repeated viewings, one may rest assured that the alternately gloomy and resplendent halls of the Beast will eternally resonate with the same cachet that gives Tara, Oz, or Rick's Cafe a ticket that allows the bearer to see just how awesome the human spirit can be.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|First of, many people have found stupid reasons to hate this cd.  I would like to address them.<br />1. No Parental Advisory: Big deal, so they decide not to swear.  Now all age groups can purchase their CD and religious people won't feel guilty about listening to it.<br />2. Acoustic: The band just wanted to prove how versatile they were.  Acoustic songs prove this.<br />3. Not as much screaming and not near as heavy: Too many people were only listening to them because they were a crazy, dark metal band.  They decided to change the focus on the music, and draw less attention to the masks.<br />All in all, the songs are great and meaningful.  It is a must buy for anyone.

B00005JMEW|4.0|Uma Thurman plays the unnamed heroine who is out to get revenge four years after being shot down and falling into a coma. Four years ago her fiance and friends were shot down in a chapel in Texas by the Deadly Viper Assasination Squad of which she used to belong. After remaining in a coma due to a shot in the head, she wakes up four years later and has a list of five names of people belonging to the Squad who she has decided to hunt down and kill. The list includes O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Bud (Bill Madsen), Bill (David Carradine) and another which I have forgotten.<br />A few months after her release from hospital she goes to the house of the fifth member of the Viper Squad and has wonderfully choreographed fight scene with her ending in a blade thrown at the viper member.<br />Next the action goes to Japan where we learn the story of O Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) who lost her parents at a young age and got revenge for both their deaths even before she was a teen. She is now the head of the Yakuza, Japanese mafia. This part of the story was recounted in Japanese anime and worked really well. Next we see the powerful O Ren Ishii with her gang including a crazy Japanese schoolgirl who is her official bodyguard and a half French/half Japanese assistant played by the gorgeous Julie Dreyfuss together with a whole bunch of men dressed in black suits. The action moves to a Japanese restaurant where our heroine has tracked down O Ren Ishii but must fight like a 100 Yakuzas. Lots of limb chopping here and blood spurting verging on the ridiculous and which I found rather comical. After killing or maiming most of the 100 men in black suits our heroine finally gets to fight O Ren Ishii which I found to be rather disppointing. More staring each other out rather than real fighting. Of course, we can guess who wins the fight. You'll have to watch Volume 2 to see Uma hunt down the remaining three on her list.<br />I enjoyed the film even though it is a rehash of many Hong Kong Kung Fu movies. There was a lot of attention to detail which even included an opening title with the Shaw Brothers. The switch from black and white and then to colour was most effective and the fights scenes although not as good as the original HK KUng Fu movies manage to hold their own. But beware of the amount of blood this film shows if you are on the sensitive side but I personally found the blood squirting scenes more funny rather than gory as they were definitely overdone (deliberately).<br />Lealingh of many Hong Kong Kung Fu movies.

B000089RVR|5.0|I loved &quot;No Angel&quot; and couldn't wait until &quot;Life For Rent&quot; came out.  This album is just as great.  Every song is unique and her voice is absolutely beautiful and soothing.  I listen to it all the time.  Each time you hear it, it sounds better.  Love all songs!  Dido is a great artist, can't wait until her next CD comes out.
B000056BOR|4.0|Doris Day plays Cathy Timberlake, an unemployed girl next door from outta town. Cary Grant plays the suave and sophisticated Phillip Shane Managing Director of a successful company. On a rainy day in Manhattan Phillip Shane's car accidentally splashes Cathy Timberlake who is standing on the edge of a kerb. Later from his office he spots Cathy on the street and he sends his assitant Gig Young to apologise and to give her money to compensate for her ruined dress. Cathy is not impressed and says to Gig Young that she wants to throw the money back in Philipp's face so she goes up to his office but instead of telling him off she falls for his good looks and charm. She is then whisked off to a meeting of board directors, flies on his private jet, attends a UN speech and ends the day attending a baseball match. Cathy is thoroughly smitten by Phillip and he is really impressed by her so much that he asks her to go away with him for the weekend to Bahamas.<br />Being Doris Day, Cathy is of course all virtuous and is in a dilemma as to whether she should go away on her dirty weekend with Phillip. She decides no but is finally persuaded to do so because Phillip goads her into do so. She has a wonderful time until the night arrives and is faced by being seduced by Phillip at which point she is so stressed that she develops a rash all over. So poor Phillip is left playing cards on the terrace with another man who's wife &quot;is not well&quot;. So Cathy returns to New York with her virtue in tact. She tries to lure Phillip away again and the second time is so drunk that she falls off her balcony. Phillip decides to not woo her any longer and finds her a job in a credit card company only for her to mess up the company's entire filing system. In the end, to win back Phillip, Cathy and her roommate, Audrey Meadows think up of a plan for her to go away with the sleazeball who works at the local benefits office and for Phillip to chase after them which inevitably he does.<br />This film is a bit dated ie Cathy being virtuous and shy but it's a great comedy. If you love vintage clothing from the sixties there's even a catwalk run thrown in. The colours are wonderful and the lines delivered by the actors are sharp. Doris Day is her usual bubbly self and you couldn't get smoother guy than Cary Grant.

Doris Day is her usual bubbly self and you couldn't get smoother guy than Cary Grant. Fun film to watch on a rainy day in. <br />Lealing
B00005RIKI|5.0|The first album from Lynyrd Skynyrd is truly a classic rock legend.  In what other other 80 minutes of music can you find classics such as tuesdays gone, give me three steps, simple man, and of course, free bird?  You just have to enjoy music to enjoy skynyrd's first.  They know how to make an excellent song, they know how to create meaningful lyrics, and most importantly, they know how to rock out.If you are looking for a band that is up there with Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd as some of the greatest bands of all time, then go buy this album.
0393057658|4.0|This book has gotten a lot of hype and positive press.  I enjoyed it but did not necessarily think it lived up to all the hype, particularly since most of the key points are made in the first half of the book and then the book seems to meander (though in an enjoyable way) and then just suddenly stops with no conclusion since everything relevant was said earlier.  The book highlights how the analysis of baseball has become more detailed than in years past as creative, statistically oriented analysts such as Bill James and computers have enabled detailed number crunching of data from every aspect of the game -- which leads to conclusions about what makes pitchers and hitters effective that may not match &quot;conventional wisdom&quot;.<br />The book makes a few key points about how the As have built an impressive team without a budget similar to that of teams like the Yankees and Red Sox.  Don't draft high school kids and / or players with agents who will demand large signing bonuses.  Focus on college players who have many years / games of statistics that you can analyze to predict as much as possible how they may fare in the major leagues.  As for what statistics to focus on: on-base percentage. To build a successful team, a GM needs to find hitters who know the strike zone, are patient and willing to take pitches, will take the pitcher deep into the count (and therefore raise the pitch count for starters and get them out of the game sooner), and are as happy to get a walk as a hit.  Then, as a manager, don't overthink -- no sacrifice bunts and no steals, just aim to get players on base and let the hitters hit.  Those seemed to be the basic points of the book and the As approach to building a successful franchise (very impressive given that they often have lesser known players and regular turnover as they do not compete to keep their &quot;stars&quot; once they are free agents able to command lucrative long-term contracts).

B00003CXCT|1.0|Han shooting only after Greedo shoots is just one of the worst offenses of a movie kid-napping ever.  Changing the character of Han from a tough, take care of #1, scoundrel.  But now, he's more like a flower child that only shot at Greedo [the bounty hunter that can't hit something from a half meter away?] because Greedo shot first.<br />Dumb.
B000005RTG|3.0|Come Taste the Band was disappointing to many Purple fans because it lacks one of the driving forces of the band, and indeed its most visual and spectacular player - Richie Blackmore. Without him many wondered really whether this could really be DP at all. As a result, this album is shunned by most fans. Personally, as someone who loves Blackmore, they are both right and wrong. Tommy Bolin is a completely different sounding player to Blackmore - gone are the slick, perfectly played, bluesy, and sustained melodic and blisteringly fast lines of Blackmore, in with plenty of overdriven slide guitar and jamming over the top of the still formidable Purple rhythm section. Lots of overdubs as opposed to the Blackmore clarity of purpose. The album in many ways lacks the killer riffs that Blackmore could, and can, conjure up in his sleep. But I still like this album. Although it sounds very different, the material is still pretty good, and Bolin makes the material his own. Coverdale is just superb (as he really was in the 70s) and Bolin is much more at home with Glenn Hughes' love of funk - harkening back to his days with Billy Cobham. Is this a great album? No, but it is certainly a fair-to-good heavy rock album that has its moments.
1577311523|5.0|If you are a bit weary of being a constant &quot;seeker&quot; and would rather graduate to &quot;finder&quot; then this might be the book you're looking for.  Rather than pop culture self help platitudes, Eckhart Tolle draws from his own emotional meltdown and the resulting awareness/revelation he gained from that dark experience.  He seems to have reached the same conclusions that Lester Levenson did in his book No Attachments, No Aversions -- that the essence of peace and joy is in letting go and accepting what is,  totally and unconditionally.  But Tolle goes the extra mile and, in an easy-to-digest question and answer format, asks all the hard hitting &quot;yeah but what about this...&quot; type questions that most authors/philopshers/gurus avoid.  For instance, how is &quot;surrender&quot; different that &quot;giving up&quot;.  I give him credit for not flinching and for writing an honest, straightforward book about what it takes to really experience life.  What I especially admire is that he seems to have acheived what he prescribes, the ability to live joyfully in the present, even in the face of adversity.
B000286SCO|5.0|This DvD is incredible well actually quite good produced for being the first traspased from Vhs to dvd!! the songs selected on it are just perfect. if you are a real Dream theater fan you will enyoy it as Live scenes from N.Y.
0778320448|4.0|I love this author, and this book is in keeping with her best!!! I loved the characters and the pace of the book, although alittle predictable, it still comes with charm.  I could feel the characters joys and pains, (which is a trade mark, I think of Debbies) and came full circle with their stories.  Debbie, you did  it again.  Thank you for this book it was a great story.  Can't wait for the next.  Loved the hardback addition, made this book feel special and it was.
0316666343|4.0|The prologue for this book, in which the author invites you to peer into a snow-cone and gaze at a lonely penguin, sets the tone for the whole work. In many ways, it's not the plot or the characters, or even the execution of this novel that matter, but the constant attention to detail that sets this novel apart. In witnessing small but significant events: the main character concentrating on a flower, a hand brushing past someone's face, the tiny wheels of a bicycle charm on a bracelet, we are brought into the writer's world.<br />Not for the impatient reader, this one deserves to be read with plenty of time and space to linger over the details.
B00020HEL6|3.0|Yes her voice is incredible. Sure, she may be a great singer for the age of, what is it? 14? But the song selections could be better.  The songs themselves are magnificent old tunes, but should be kept to being sung by legends like Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald and Etta James.  No doubt Renee would be amazing...with songs of her own.  Is it to much to ask now a days for a record company to use something other than classics (which is some opinions should not be touched by others)? They hire song writers who put out hundreds if not thousands of songs never heard by the public every year. Can't they choose from a few of those?  Ms. Olstead has an amazing vocal range and, yes a credible plug from pop legend Neil Sedaka, but on some songs she tries to go from note to note so slow, you can't and sometimes don't want to be able to tell what in the world she's saying.  Of course most already know because they have heard the song before, but that almost makes it a clash between Nirvana inspired groaning with the jazz of Billie Holiday.  I don't know if I would personally buy this album, but hey...maybe in the future she will do some original songs and I'm sure no one will be able to resist her soul-full crooning.
0743424425|5.0|Throughout the last century, there were many authors who wrote haunted house stories. In 1977, Stephen King beat 'em all with a haunted hotel story. You see, this is not just *any* haunted hotel story; this is THE SHINING.<br />THE SHINING is about several things, all tied up into one complex and multilayered whole. It is about a five-year-old boy who is impossibly mature and wise beyond his years, and who has a terrifying gift that seems as much a curse. It is about his father, a recovering alcoholic with demons in his soul and skeletons in his closet, who is battling both in order to keep his family financially afloat. It is about his wife, a doting mother who has braved the ups &amp; downs of her husband's turbulence, who loves him, and who wants to trust him beyond his past mistakes but is just on this side of being unable to do so. It is about a classic, Art Deco hotel tucked deep within the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, whose name is respected but nevertheless has a mysteriously chequered past. It is about the ghosts that occupy this hotel, that wish to possess the above family but can only be seen by the boy and the head cook. It is about the head cook, an older black man who shares the same gift with the boy, and who develops a special friendship with him as a result. It is about a family who begin at their last chance for hope &amp; unity, who end up fighting for their last chance at survival. This is THE SHINING.<br />THE SHINING is a true gestalt entity: it is more than the sum of its parts. Stephen King masterly intertwines all of the above elements, plus some truly frightening imagery, to create a novel of several hundred compulsively-turning pages that add up to one of the greatest experiences that I've ever had as a reader of fiction.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 15 &amp; UP
B000001DVD|5.0|As most every reviewer here has said, this is Def Leppard at its finest.  They're tighter and more refined than on &quot;On Through the Night&quot; (the blue Kenworth album) yet not as pop-metal sounding as &quot;Pyromania&quot; and certainly not as commerical as the somewhat overrated &quot;Hysteria.&quot;  This is classic early-80's hard rock, and it just doesn't get any better.
0553275976|5.0|I cannot believe that it has actually been over a decade since I read Tom Wolfe's THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES; it is a brilliant and hilarious entertaining work of satirical fiction, and a dead-on accurate social commentary of everything that made up the 1980's, commonly (and accurately) known as The Greed Decade. This includes the incendiary racial conflagrations that had been simmering throughout the 1970's that finally began to unravel during the 80's, aided and abetted by an increasingly sensationalist media that practiced underhanded &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics in order to keep the middle and working classes down by improperly (and sneakily) shifting the discussion from class to race.<br />Wolfe captures all that here, albeit in a lighter tone, by following four separate tracks concurrently, and how they all come together: Financially successful but amoral and philandering nouveau-riche bond trader Sherman McCoy, professional successful but financially wanting assistant prosecutor Lawrence Kramer, professionally unsuccessful and perpetually inebriated British-born tabloid 'journalist' Peter Fallow, and socially powerful (but under-respected) self-proclaimed African-American leader Reverend Reginald Bacon. The bonfire that their vanities create is fascinating; but what is best about this book is the insightful and real-to-life humor/social commentary that Wolfe weaves into the story throughout. If you're a relatively young reader who was born in the 80's and thusly do not remember it the way that, let's say, those of us born in 1967 do, then the reading of this book is absolutely essential to understanding all the different dysfunctional facets that made the 1980's the way it was. <br />Do not be put off by the story's length (705 pages); it is so enjoyable and is such a compulsive page-turner that it is likely that it will only take you a week or less to get through it all. Pick this one up and treat yourself to the hilarious world of THE BONFIRE OFTHE VANITIES---and if you must, rent the 1990 Brian De Palma-directed misfire and see just how totally inept Hollywood was in capturing this world. THE BONFIRE OF THE VANITIES has earned its proper place one of the greatest---and most important---works of fiction in the 20th Century.<br />MOST RECOMMENDED; AGES 17 &amp; UP
B000001FKY|3.0|While this is the album most people think of when you say &quot;Def Leppard,&quot; I have never liked it as much as their previous three albums.  I usually admire Mutt Lange's work, but his production  on this record is just too slick for my taste -- it needs more of the raw sould that he gave &quot;High &amp; Dry&quot; and &quot;Pyromania.&quot;<br />There are some good songs here (I especially love the intro to &quot;Excitable&quot;) but I'll take the first three albums over this one any day.
B0001IN07Q|5.0|Resounding thumbs up for this fabulous, energy filled recording. Both the audio and video are vivid and pure.<BR>The confidence and charisma Buble exudes is evident and coupled with his soothing tones makes for great entertainment on your tv or in your car stereo.<BR>I think we are witnessing the making of a legend.........
0064407667|5.0|You're either going to love it, or hate it!  I love it.  The word definitions that some adults have mentioned as annoying?  They're fabulous for increasing a child's vocabulary.

B0001UL7RY|5.0|In such a world of conformity, Avril Lavigne dares to hold high her middle finger and say, &quot;See that tree?  Go screw it.&quot;  I find her brazen attitude towards society admirable, and this attitude is once against beautifully represented in her music.  &quot;Under My Skin&quot; exhibits the maturity Avril has acquired through experience.  If you're interested in a deeply cathartic medium through which to channel your emotions, this CD will do the trick.
B00025ETIW|5.0|My Chemical Romance's new album is, indeed, auspicious and disappointing at the same time. There is no doubt about the writing skills of singer Gerard, the infectious guitar of Frank, and the sick drums of Matt, but as good as it sounds, there is something missing. It could be the radio friendliness that more than one person has already confronted them about, or it could be the lack of more in-your-face tunes that made their debut so ahead of its time. But even then, Three cheers for sweet revenge stands out as a winner. The first track \\"Helena\\" is logical choice for that chart topper they might be dreaming of at this point, and it is way better than the first single, \\"I'm not OK\\", which reminds us too much of those emo-punk bands from MTV. \\"You know what they do..\\" is one of the tunes that should have been multiplied throughout the record, while \\"Thank you for your venom\\" includes the poppy yet well handled chorus destined to make this another catch. \\"Cemetery drive\\", \\"It's not a fashion statement\\" and the closer \\"I never told you what I do for a living\\" only serve to confirm the direction in which MCR are, hopefully not, taking off. Less than their stunning debut, but not completely worthless. Definitely a CD that will keep us wondering if the priority here is to sell more records, take a step aside, or improve what they already do best.
1592400876|5.0|Lynne Trusses Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves is a great book to read. Its really helped me; not only is it funny, its also very astute.

0671027387|3.0|The plot line is among the less believable of Dan Brown's published works.  However, the overall debate in the novel regarding the future of NASA is very relevant to current thinking regarding NASA.  So, if you're looking for a great Dan Brown thriller this one will be a bit slow, but it may cause you to think about the politics and potential privatization of the space program or major elements of the space program.  These issues are being debated and will continue to be debated in congress and in the public over the coming years.
B000148KK2|1.0|Real dissapointment.  I loved her other CD's and bought this one without listening to it first or reading the other reviews.  This one is very, very different.  I don't even find it good background music.  I just want to get away from it!
B0001ENYKS|2.0|Just what we needed, The Strokes meets Duran Duran. To be honest the album is a fun listen the first few times, but due to it's pointless lyrics and just general shallowness it gets old fast. The songs all sound very samey aswell.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Having visited New Zealand several years back for a while and gone to the Maori Cultural Center at Lake Taupo and learned a little bit about Maori culture when I was there, I was curious to see how this movie would portray the Maoris and their culture.<br />I wasn't disppointed, and the movie gives some fascinating glimpses into several aspects of Maori history and ways. The girls are shown being taught to perform the women's dances and how to sing in the Maori language, and the gruff and stern father is shown teaching the young boys how to be a chief, how to be a warrior and fight with a wooden staff, how to dance the war dance and make the frightening facial expressions that accompany the dances, and how to chant in the Maori tongue.<br />But the story is really about the coming of age of the chief's daughter, who is destined to become the first woman chief. The father's ambition to find a suitable chief among the boys is frustrated since none really seem that motivated and capable. Worse still, his own son is pursuing a career as an artist in Europe and the father learns he's married a German girl rather than returning home to marry a Maori girl and settle in New Zealand.<br />So the father's ambition to find a suitable chief to succeed him seems doomed to failure until one day his young daughter frees a beached whale and rides it out beyond the waves, after the chief and the rest of the tribe were unable to free the animal. According to legend, a whale rider from their tribe led the Maoris to New Zealand a thousand years ago, and another whale rider would appear again some day to lead them. The chief, who initially refuses to acknowledge his daughter's abilities and threatens to disown her when he discovers she's been learning the art of the staff and had bested one of the boys, is finally forced to realize at this point that the prophecy has been fulfilled and that it is his daughter who is destined to be their chief.<br />The all-Maori cast does a great job with their roles, and all in all this movie is a fine tribute to Maori culture and traditions that provides some fascinating glimpses into this vanishing Pacfic Rim culture. Last but not least, the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard recently and really adds to the overall ambience of the movie.with their roles, and all in all this movie is a fine tribute to Maori culture and traditions that provides some fascinating glimpses into this vanishing Pacfic Rim culture.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|After such uber-misanthropic albums as their self-titled debut and Iowa, Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) falls short of their past works.  First, who ever expected Slipknot to put out two mawkish acoustic songs on one of their albums?  Not one, TWO!  And both of the songs &quot;Circle&quot; and &quot;Vermilion Pt. 2&quot; are weak on top of being acoustic.  There are a total of nine songs on this CD that are close to the Slipknot of yore, but they are still lame compared to their old stuff.  One reviewer said that Slipknot has escaped the slump in which Iowa left them.  What slump?  Iowa was pure fury and a gob of spit in the face of everything.  This CD seems like a Rick Rubin marketing ploy to make the most money possible.  There isn't a need for a clean version, because this CD has no explicit lyrics, which makes it seem like a marketing ploy.  Don't get me wrong there are some great songs on this CD, but if you were with Slipknot from early on, and are expecting a rip-roaring evilsonic album, don't waste your money on Vol. 3.  It just is not worth it.  Slipknot's wanton is wilted.
B0002858YS|3.0|Man the hook of that first single (Somebody Told Me), it's addictive, great song, the rest of the album?  I'd say two other tracks that stand out to me are Mr. Brightside and Midnight Show.  Other tracks just seem to be average, the album just came out so more songs might grow on me... The only point of reference I think of for this album is think of The Sounds, but replace Maja with a guy have a little harder/darker edged sound.  Oh and if you're planning to see them live, I happened to catch them on Kimmel, and they were pretty good.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|So, with this, her latest CD Britney did what all those other so-called pop stars say they will.  She decided to go in an entirely different direction musically and I think she succeeded immensely.  This is a unique, ecclectic compilation of songs - each one is so different than the next - while still sustaining  a powerful dance influence on almost every song.  Britney was very courageous by not going down the predictable R&amp;B route of other teen stars who say they want to do a more adult sounding album.  She actually succeeded in making an album that anyone with half a brain can enjoy.
B0000028VT|5.0|Classic Mariah! Really shows off her vocal ability. All I've Ever wanted is just the greatest!
B0002858YS|5.0|This band could be huge if they get a big break. They have recieved a small one in Chicago, where popular DJ Mancow has made them a favorite. This cd is a great combination of Garage Rock mixed with 80's britpop, and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" has the potential to be a breakthrough hit. The rest of the songs on this album vary in musical style, but all have an uplifting tone, and all are great. Plus, the cd is pretty cheap, only $9 where I bought it<br />this is one of the few disks I have given a must-buy
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth is truly one of a kind.  They have such a sophisticated and incredible sound and style, and as a death metal band, it is amazing that they can pull off putting out such a mellow album, but they did.  I love it, and advise anyone who loves true music to buy it.
B00005JKJA|2.0|David Lynch, who directed this movie, IS NOT FOR EVERYONE!<br />I learned many years ago that David Lynch is very talented but that his movies are hit and miss. When I see a title by Lynch, I am intrigued but ultimately ambivalent. I recall the cinematic pleasure I received from viewing &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;. However, when I recall that this is the same director who gave us &quot;Dune&quot; (the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen) and &quot;Wild at Heart&quot; (had one titillating scene but was too much like watching an overly melodramatic film on acid), I have passed other films of his by.<br />&quot;Muldholland Drive&quot; was typical David Lynch from the beginning. There is a compelling (if unbelievable) plot here, but there is an eerie sense of the unknown penetrating every scene that made me question thirty times in the first fifteen minutes if I was in the mood for this crap tonight. I gave it a chance and found myself drawn in.<br />I was engrossed in this film through the first ninety minutes. Then, I accidentally turned my DVD player off while trying to stop the movie for a minute. I was irritated to find out that this DVD does not have a scene selection feature to allow you to approximate with accuracy where you had left off. I never watched the final portion.<br />I was enjoying what I saw. I would have given this film 3 STARS, but the absence of the scene selection feature on the DVD makes me lower the overall rating to 2 STARS.
B00006BTCA|4.0|The English legends Joy Division made two very dark albums at the end of the 70's. Now a fivesome from New York City has finally picked up where Joy Division ended.<br />They sound better, there is a great sounding wall of electric guitar noise and synthisezir on the background, The bass drives all the songs, sometimes even with single notes that do not seem to fit but add something extra to the songs.<br />They have borrowed some minimalistic elements from the 80's Sonic Youth making it dreamy, hypnotizing and spacy at the same time. I haven't been impressed much by some of the albums of the last 5 years but this one definitely is one of the best. Just put on your headphones, blindfold the room or yourself and listen, it's great.
B000050FEN|2.0|Others have already summarized the film, so I'll just make the comment that Se7evn's seemingly brilliant plot completely falls apart at the end.  The screenwriter apparently got muddled towards the grand finale and just did whatever sorta worked.  Also, if you're even moderately squeamish, you won't appreciate the gruesome violence, especially when you realize that you followed it all that way only to find a crippled ending.
0800177177|4.0|This movie has tried to stay close to the original novel by Bram Stoker and has done a good job. There has often been debate about the sexual connotations in the book and the screenwriters have kept it in, since it is sometimes very sexual.<br />The special affects are great, make-up is fantasticly done and the monsters really scary, I thought the entire movie was scary.<br />Great acting performances come from Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing and Tom Waits. Keanu Reeves unfortunately speaks a fake English and is not that great.<br />If you like Vampire movies be certain to see this
B00005V9IK|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. I saw it in the theater when it first came out and it had me cheering for the good old U.S.A Great affects, great acting, and has a few funny scenes in it. A must see for those who enjoy this type of movie.
B00005B5L4|5.0|For Stevie Nicks fans, this Rumours DVD-Audio disc is mandatory!!<br />I recently purchased a Toshiba DVD-A player, a JVC Receiver designed for DVD-A, Monster audio cables designed for SACD/DVD-Audio, and I added one Infinity Beta Center speaker (designed for SACD/DVD-A) to my old stereo speakers.  (I still need Beta Surround speakers).<br />A set-up similar to that results in the best reproduction of the the Fleetwood Mac &quot;Rumours DVD-A&quot;  &amp; others such as Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's DVD-A.<br />The Rumours DVD-A sounds much better than the Rumours CD...  <br />I played them both and obvserved that the sound is clearer, has better tones, and is much more impressive, (and worth the DVD-A electonic equipment costs).  On the song - The Chain - McVie's solo bass notes have outstanding tone on the DVD-A  as compared to the CD!!! Just like he is in my living room. Overall, the sound on the DVD-A is outstanding.  Good work Fleetwood Mac &amp; Warner Brothers!!!<br />When playing the DVD-A in Pro Logic, Enhanced Stereo, or in PCM, it also sounds very good. I haven't tried DTS yet.<br />Stevie's &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; is the best I have ever heard.  And, Stevie's delicate voice comes through brilliantly on her famous &quot;Silver Springs&quot; as well as on the &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; along with the powerful band music in the background.<br />You also get many pictures with each song you can click on.  You can play another section where there is no singing - only the instrumentals with Stevie, Lindsey, Mick &amp; John explaining how they wrote or recorded each song.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I was extremely disapointed in this movie. It was soooooooo boring. It started off with a battle. Then it dragged on and on and ended in a battle. Plus, the ending was one of the worst I have ever seen.
B0000039PW|5.0|What Can I Say, Words can't explain the brillence of this work of art. Although life after death is another classic album i think it had to much of a commercial feel to it, but as for this album this is real hip-hop. It's like sex in your ear, you can't get enough. You have to get this album it's a must. If u don't have this album your not a hip-hop fan. Tupac is great but the difference between the two is that pac best work was the songs he released commercially and Biggie best work is in his albums. Notorious B.I.G The Best Rapper Ever!!! R.I.P, Your Missed...Bx Whattup!!!!
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I am a big fan of Radiohead and I can't get enough of them, but because of their unique sound I havent been able to find much else similar to them. And then I heard Muse's music and I have to say that they do have similarities to Bends-era Radiohead in some of their songs. But despite what others are saying, it is different enough to distinguish it from a Radiohead record. Sure Muse might have been copying a familiar sound to some extent (particularly the singer who has a very Thom-like voice), but that is okay because this is a GREAT album. Every song has well constructed layers of instrumental music, catchy tunes, and just the right amount of electronic experimentation.<BR>You will be grabbed the first time you hear Absolution, and you will want to keep listening to it again and again. I recommend this album to anyone who likes Radiohead, or anyone that just likes good music. It will give your ears orgasms.
B0000584V3|5.0|No seriously, Opeth portrays one of best musical and lyrical projects ever created. Buy it, if you love music. Just because it is 8 tracks long doesn't mean it isnt worth it. It is longer than most cds I own. I admire Opeth for having enough talent to be able to write for 10 minutes long. The title track only is worth the cd. Opeth's ability to combin progressive metal, acoustics, and death metal is impressive and they do it with each release. Buy this album you won't be let down<br />To add on, Opeth actually has talent compared to all other so called metal bands. It is a must have for metal heads and a must have for all Korn fans who think they are so &quot;hXc&quot;.
B00014TQ7S|5.0|Franz Ferdinand. Franz Ferdinand. How do I love thee? I shall count the ways...<br />First of all, I love the name. Not only is it oratorically and phonetically sound, the meaning behind it seems almost anarchical. Indeed, the actual person Franz Ferdinand caused the first World War by his death. Maybe not anarchic, but the name is just perfect for a rock band.<br />I also love the music. Sometimes, you just need fun music, and Franz Ferdinand definitely delivers. My ultimate favorite, 'Take Me Out,' has this great, intoxicating rhythm that changes halfway through the song. You can scream to it, sing to it, tap your foot to it, whatever. Either way, after hearing this song a few times, you'll find yourself humming it, rather out of tunely, anytime there is silence.<BR>Another great song on the disc is 'Dark of the Matinee.' Although not engulfing all of the greatness of its predecessor, 'Take Me Out,' it still has a great sound, and in some senses, is more singable.<BR>Finally, 'This Fire,' is also a noteable song. I find myself repeating this one almost as often as 'Take Me Out.' This song has the beat, sound, rhythm, lyrics.<br />I also like the fact that for some reason, it feels like summer when I play the CD in my car. It's danceable, head banging, sing-along music that is priceless!<br />Let's face it; Franz Ferdinand is quite excellent. Really!
B000267JOW|5.0|This album completely blew me away from the moment I put the CD in my home theater stereo system.  The track that really stood out for me was 11th Hour.  From start to finish, that song was absolutely brutal as it pounded my ears and cracked my bones.  A minute and 30 seconds into the song until the end was the epitome of heavy.  Words cannot describe how seriously affected I was by the whole CD.  In an industry where money overwhelms, Lamb of God proved to me that they're very serious about what they are doing.  They have created an album that lives up to Revolver's statements.  I give it 10 stars out of 5 stars and I hope that their next offering intensifies even more their talent.
6305161879|4.0|I LOVE Monty Python AND John Cleese teaches part-time here at Cornell, so when he gave a talk and mentioned the plot of AFCW, I thought I'd check it out.  It was great seeing a couple of the Python troup in a non-Python role.  Be warned, although the movie is very funny (7.8 out of 10) it's not at all the same type of humour as Python.<br />My absolute favorite part, which doesn't give anything about the movie away, is near the end when John Cleese imitates an American accent.  Usually we see comedians here making fun of British, French, and other foreign accents, so it was fun to see someone try to imitate us here in the States.<br />I'd say this is a MUST RENT no matter what and a MUST BUY for anyone who likes British humour and/or wants to see Cleese do something different.
B0001AVZA8|2.0|a silly and contrived exploitation of the &quot;Golden Years marketing potential&quot; of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Yes, they are smiling all the way to the bank off this hopelessly soporific and pointless film.<br />Boring.
B000089RVX|5.0|I am not usually a rock fan but this album is more than just plain rock. The songs that Amy Lee sings are full of emotion and passion. Since Evanescence means transient and passing, her songs are mostly about dying. Some people might think the album entirely TOO depressing, but the lyrics make a perfect fit with the music as a whole. I think it is more you love it or you hate it kind of thing. <br />The song &quot;My Immortal&quot; could literally make you cry with Lee's moving voice and the sad lyrics. And don't think that &quot;My Immortal&quot; is the only great song because its not. I actually have seven songs tied for my favorite, including that one, and believe me the other four get more than their share of listening to too. The melodies, lyrics, and everything are wonderful. I never go on a road trip without bringing this CD. Buy it for yourselves and see because this is one of few albums out in the world worth the money.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|The ROTK soundtrack is a magnificent installment of Shore's. The songs capture the distinct climaxes of the movie, allowing the listener to visualize those great movie scenes again and again. Howard Shore's creation is a great companion to Peter Jackson's &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.
0553208845|3.0|This book is a brilliant work, teeming with symbolism within characters, plot, and various events that take place during the lifelong spiritual journey of Siddhartha, a Brahman's son.  One may say this self-disovery search would categorize this novel in the coming of age genre.  Yet it goes beyond that.  We see a young boy, though wise beyond his years at a tender age, transform into an ageing man who has been through every phase and stage of life.  He's grown and developed.  We come to understand how various events play out in his life, molding him and shaping him into the person he becomes.<br />Though this book is a mere 160 pages, it is no easy read.  You need to decipher it by each threading sentence to understand the semi-complex symbolism - and it doesn't always jump right out at you, either.  And if you're looking for a book with realistic characters who think the thoughts and feel the emotions of average people, look elsewhere.  Often times, this is what I prefer in my reads, but this was a nice change from my usual teen fluff of high school angst and turmoil.  I'd recommend it for ages 13 and older.<br />I used this book to parallel with my history lesson.  Siddhartha's journey of self-discovery is said to be based on the life of Buddha, who set out to search for enlightenment.  He wished to come to understand the causes of human suffering and he achieved his goal.  It appears Siddhartha came to see the main cause of misery in human beings just like Buddha - that one thing happens to be desire.  The stages and phases of Siddhartha's life lead him from a beggar to one who lives the overprivileged life, filled with material riches and wealths.  During this period, Siddhartha gets high off the adrenaline rush of gambling, gambling, gambling...and winning over and over again - it isn't for money's sake.  Siddhartha comes to realize the riches and wealth the world has to offer make him unhappy.  In fact, it appears he, in all honestly, was happier as a beggar.<br />Siddhartha is one-dimensional and barely seems human.  As I said before, he does not feel an average person's emotions.  This is proven by how easily he leaves his father and his first-born sun, not shedding a single tear.  However, Siddhartha does indeed show extreme perseverance and determination.  Overall, Hesse uses him, along with other characters, to convey his symbolism.  He succeeds.  That, perhaps, is why SIDDHARTHA has been enjoyed for generations and will continue to be a favorite, the type of novel that can be read during any time and any phase of life.br />Siddhartha is one-dimensional and barely seems human.

B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This is a movie that makes dumb people feel like they are experiencing &quot;art.&quot; They are plenty of movies that matter; movies that, while horribly depressing, have something to say about the human condition. This is not one of them. This is a movie that portrays the kind of deep emotions and complex logic that can only be learned from other, similarly shallow, Hollywood swill. The lack of careful examination that went into this film just makes me angry.
B000002ORU|5.0|Just a simple review...You like the Who You will like the box set....I love it...Being a Who fan I love it...The early songs on the first disk are fun to listen to.. Certain tracks like Who Are You are edited and shortened...but who cares if Your a real Who fan You have the (Who Are You cd anyway)  2 thumbs up

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I watched this show as much as I could when it first aired, but wasn't and I still don't watch a lot of TV because of the rest of the junk that's on. I remember seeing some episodes and wondering what was going on (especially when they finally aired the pilot later) It was confusing- now I find out it was presented all out of order! I thought the show had potential, but was just ok. Then I saw the boxed set in the store and said to myself, &quot;What the hell, i'm in a good mood today,&quot; (I don't like to spend money on a whim, but i plunked down the dough anyway and brought it home. After watching about half the episodes, I can honestly say this was a pretty good show. I'm not a fan of Joss Wheadon, I never once saw Buffy or Angel, but this show attracted me. The episode he wrote so far seems to have the most clever dialogue. Hey, it's the guy from &quot;Two Guys and a Girl!&quot; Anyway I will go see the movie when it comes out. Favorite effect: The Reaver ship following Serenity through the sky while smoke and flames are spewing out the back- Way cool! Looked like a giant oil fire!
B000002KKS|5.0|Two albums turned me on to Sabbath, pretty much simultaneously in the early 80s - Paranoid and Heaven and Hell. Isn't that something! Quintessential Ozzy and Dio! It's easy see how Paranoid makes it in to the upper echelons of Metal History, but I think this one gets a place there too. I can't, to this day, hear Neon Knights without getting chills. And the title track...are you kidding me! Tony Iommi displays for all to hear why he is a god amongst metal guitarists everywhere, why even James Hetfield gets nervous around him. Nobody should ever make the mistake of thinking Sabbath died when Ozzy left.
B000002KJQ|2.0|Beware!!! When This Album Was Released On CD In The Early 90's They Used The Remixed Version That Appears On The ZZ Top Six Pack Compilation. In Todays Music World It's A Horrid Representation Of A Great Classic Rock Album (It, And The First Album, Rio Grande Mud, Fandango, Tejas &amp; El Loco All Sound Like &quot;Eliminator&quot; &amp; &quot;Afterburner&quot; Clones. Go To Your Nearest 2nd Hand Store And Find Them On Vinyl or Cassette. Until Then We Can Only Hope ZZ Top &amp; Warner Bros. Get Their Act Together, Hmmmm...Calling Rhino Records?
B000002KE2|5.0|I don't think there is a hard rock song cooler than Supernaut. It is, I think, one of their best. I have so much difficulty ranking the Sabbath oeuvre. There are moments in all of them that I think sag somewhat, if I'm being honest. But, in total, they are all (especially the first 6) such complete and powerful metal experiences that I can't give them anything less than 5 stars.
B000002J2F|2.0|Duke marked the start of the late period of Genesis (1980-1997) when the band were a pop/rock act with less then 4 prog rockers on every album. As such Duke seriously comes up short. Theres a lot of terrible numbers on this album and the only highlights on this album are the 2 and 1/2 minute intros of Behind The Lines and Duchess, the endings of both songs, the instrumental part of Dukes travels (not the lyrics which are unoriginally lifted from Guide Vocal) and Dukes End even though it is also unoriginal. These places show the group could atleast still show great creativity.
0385336810|5.0|I have read all three shopaholic books as well as Can you keep a secret and Sophie Kinsella has become my new favorite author. The book keeps you laughing out loud until the very end. I definately recomend this book, i couldn't put it down.
B000002J27|4.0|A Trick Of The Tail was the first album of the Genesis middle period (1976-1978) when the band was climaxing thier Prog Rock sound and beggining thier Pop Rock sound and its pretty good even without Peter. Tony adds to his synth arsenal and Phil provides a wistle on the opening track and a chime on Mad Man Moon and interesting drumming (like bongos) on Los Endos keeping the music interesting. The only drawbacks are that the mostly instrumental Los Endos (im surprised some people call it an instrumental) lifts lyrics from Suppers Ready at the end of the song and the title track is forgettable.
078322804X|5.0|This movie is the best! Simply the best movie! Lots of Blues music, lots of Elwood and Jake dancing, and tons of car chases because their always running away from the cops! But remember-they'll never get caught, they're on a mission from God. I think everyone should get this and watch this over and over! The performances are great, the singing, and the dancing! You'll love this movie, and it'll become your favorite! If not, It sure has been added to my DVD collection, and it's been my favorite movie now for over three months, and I watch it all the time!
B000002J2D|2.0|And Then There Were Three was the final album of Genesis' middle period (1976-1978) and first album without Steve Hackett. Steve was the final cog in the wheel of Genesis as a glorious prog rock band. With this album Genesis made an album with only 2 highlights Burning Rope and The Lady Lies and 3 ok songs Ballad Of Big, Deep In The Motherlode and Down And Out (a critical stab at Steve Hackett for his departure due to the more commercial and less creative sound cropping up in Genesis). The rest of the album is awful.
B00005MP58|5.0|The movie aboslutely does justice to the fabulous novel!!  It is funny, charming, and very witty.  If you loved the book, you will love the movie.  If you love the movie, you will HAVE to read the book!<BR>The only thing that could be called a &quot;problem&quot; about this movie is that Colin Firth is a tad...older, shall we say...than Mr. Darcy was.  BUT he's amazing in it, and does it wonderfully!  As do ALL the other characters!  <BR>You HAVE to watch it!
B000002J2B|3.0|Wind &amp; Wuthering was the 2nd album of Genesis' middle period (1976-1978) and it featured two bad commercial pop balleds Your Own Special Way and Afterglow and 2 ok half pop and half prog songs All In A Mouses Night and Blood On The RoofTops and these bog it down from greatness. On the plus side Tony Banks further expands his palate of keyboards, Steve Hackett provides some nice kalimba playing and Phil uses the cymbals to good effect. Songs like Eleventh Earl Of Mar (featuring Steves kalimba) and Wot Gorrila (featuring Phils cymbals) are amazing. As are the other 3 highlights Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers, In That Quiet Earth and One For The Vine but with Afterglow and Your Own Special Way this was clearly the beggining of the end end for Genesis as a quality band.
0062502182|4.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" is the second book I have read by Paulo Coelho, the first being \\"Eleven Minutes\\".  As with \\"Eleven Minutes\\" I found this book to be a quick read, and hard to put down.  It is the story of a Spanish shepherd boy named Santiago, who goes in search of his \\"Personal Legend\\".  He is started on his quest by a Gypsy woman and a man who calls himself king.  He runs into many people and obstacles along the way, and always his desire to obtain his Personal Legend sees himself through.  One of the people he meets is the Alchemist, from which the book gets its title, and he is instrumental in helping Santiago reach his goal.  <br />This book is different then \\"Eleven Minutes\\" in many ways.  The style is lighter, and it is clearly not meant to be a true story.  The reader never doubts that Santiago will succeed in his quest, nor feels suspense at the dangers he encounters.  However, suspense is not the purpose of this book.  This book is about dreams, and listening to one's heart, and in that it does its job very well.

B00002E224|5.0|It's a shame that so few people saw this movie in the theater.  It is smartly scripted, well acted, beautifully filmed, and, quite simply, one of the two or three best movies to come out of the 1990s.  Fortunately, people have discovered it gradually, in the years since it came out, and it has worked its magic on them.
B000022TSV|4.0|One of the best Opera Movies.<BR>Oh sure Opera purists will quibble with the choice of Julia Migenes Johnson because she is not a \\"classic\\" Carmen.<BR>But believe me, when she seduces Don Jose while she is being detained, I too was seduced.  In some other operatic productions on film the only way you could tell the leading lady was beautiful or seductive was because the characters told you, despite the obvious proof to the contrary.<BR>In this beautifully shot film Carmen is not a ravishing beauty, if anything Micaela (Faith Esham, who is, by contrast, lovely and whose voice in both the duet with Don Jose and her solo later on, soars as high as the mountains in the background) is a doll.  She's a good girl and his mama's choice for his future.  <BR>Don Jose's career path is also set.  He's a good soldier and due for promotion.  Yet he'll throw it all away on a promise of Manzanilla and some hot lovin' and we believe it because Julia Johnson sells it.  <BR>The film portrays Carmen as a 21st Century woman stuck in a dusty backwater world, where strict formalities are mocked by the common folk (witness the children mocking the soldiers in the beginning).  She's not a slut, she's a playful flirt who doesn't recognize Jose's seriousness.<BR>I can quibble with some things myself, for example the aforementioned duet between Jose and Micaela is shown in a long shot that feels like it goes on forever.  Give me a couple of close ups, please.  I understand their wanting to show the stiffness and formality (and distance?) between the two, but there's no need to bore us;  and there maybe too much dust swirling about as the peasants dance about, but you do get a sense of reality often missing in operas (or even movie musicals when shot on location, like West Side Story, though shot in Manhattan, where was the garbage?)<BR>This movie works on the two levels it strives for.  The opera is wonderfully performed by both singers and orchestra.  The story is timeless and the plot easy to swallow.  Cinematography is top notch, and though the direction could have been more imaginative<BR>this is more than a good opera movie, this is a good movie.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|It is sad to see the poor reviews for this story. The story line was funny and yet sentimental. It is about a son who is tired of his father's exaggerated stories. He finds that maybe his father's stories might not have been so exaggerated, just a little colorful. Great movie with a great moral.
B000024D4R|5.0|Animals may be an underrated Floyd album but it is definitely one of their best.  Dogs, Pigs, and Sheep are wonderfully composed songs that are brimming with emotion and showcase David Gilmour's skillfull playing. Pigs on the Wing pt 1 and 2 are a perfect album opener and closer.  I highly recommend this album.
B000003TAB|4.0|ok....this cd is geat. anyone who says this cd is only for &quot;hardcore&quot; nirvana fans is wrong! do not hesitate to buy this cd. i let my friend who doesn't like nirvana at all (atleast there previous albums) listen to this cd, and he loved it. anyone can find atleast one song on this cd that they will like. My favorite are Sliver, Been A Son, Son of A Gun, Molly's Lips and Turnaround. these are the more &quot;popier&quot; songs on the album. this album isn't anywhere near as good as Nevermind, but trust me! BUY IT!!! hardcore fans and people who have never heard a nirvana song! you could say this album has a lot of diversity on it i guess. just get it!!!!!!!!!PLEEEASSSEEE!!!!<BR>after you get this... go get Nevermind,,, after that yull be hooked.
B0001AP12G|5.0|College Dropout actually gets a 4.5 but I rounded up. <BR>1. Intro - Fits perfectly into the \\"college\\" theme. Its the graduating tune or somethin'. 5/5 <BR>2. We Don't Care - This is one of my favorite songs on the album. Talks about people that didnt believe in him. It features GLC. \\"We wasn't 'sposed to make it past 25, the jokes on you we still alive.\\" 4.5/5 <BR>3. Graduation Day - It has some old guy yakkin' at Kanye about graduation day or some stuff like that. 2.5/5 <BR>4. All Falls Down - This is I think the third single off the album. It's good but the radio played it too much and kinda ruined it for me but I liked it before the radio stations got a hold of it. \\"We all self-conscious, I'm just the first to admit it.\\" 3.5/5 <BR>5. I'll Fly Away - It has a bunch of dudes singing. Soulful. Heh. Leads up to... 3/5 <BR>6. Spaceship - This is a good song, but its not one of the better ones. Blah. \\"I been workin' this graveshift, and I ain't made (...).\\" Features GLC and Consequence 2.5/5 <BR>7. Jesus Walks - I'm actually a non-believer so I thought I wouldn't like this song but it became one of my favorite tracks. It's just a dude stickin' by his guns and not changing because he's famous and I gotta appreciate that. \\"Yo, I eat pieces of (...) like you for breakfast. Y'all eat pieces of (...)? What's the basis?\\" 4.5/5 <BR>8. Never Let Me Down - This is a sweet track that features Jay Z and J Ivy. It has a hot beat. \\"I know they don't want me in the damn club, they even make me show ID to get inside of Sam's Club.\\" 3.5/5 <BR>9. Get Em High - This song has a nice beat. The chorus is funny. I love the first part of the song where he is going without a breath for a while. This features Talib Kweli and Common. \\"And I will cut yo' girl like pass the 'dro, and I don't usually smoke but pass the 'dro.\\" 3/5 <BR>10. Workout Plan - This is a pretty funny skit. Heh, \\"free.99\\". 3/5 <BR>11. The New Workout Plan - This song is funny! It's witty too! This is in the top five on thealbum. \\"Ooh girl your breath is harsh, cover your mouth up like you got SARS.\\" 4.5/5 <BR>12. Slow Jamz - This is I think the second single off the album. Radio played this more than \\"All Falls Down\\" but its still good. Never did get annoying to me. It's to bad but Twista really steals the show in this one. Who knew Jamie Foxx could sing. If you haven't noticed it features Twista and Jamie Foxx. \\"My dogg said you ain't no freak, now you got to prove my man wrong.\\" 5/5 <BR>13. Breathe In Breathe Out - I was really excited about this track because it features Ludacris and he is one of my favorite rappers. He only does the chorus but its still pretty good. The lyrics make this one of the best songs on the album. \\"Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick, I always had a PHD, a Pretty Huge D*ck.\\" 4.5/5 <BR>14. School Spirit Skit 1 - This is the funniest skit on the album. At least I thought it was funny. \\"Hey you know what sexy? No I don't know what it is, but I bet I could add up all the change in your purse very fast.\\" 4/5 <BR>15. School Spirit - This is a cool song and the beat is cool. Hell, the chorus is good too, just an all around good song. Not great though just average. \\"Told 'em I finished school and I started my own business. They say, Oh, you graduated? No, I decided I was finished.\\" 3.5/5 <BR>16. School Spirit Skit 2 - This one isn't as good as SSS1 but its ok. 2.5/5 <BR>17. Lil Jimmy Skit - Another skit, this one's about the other dudes son. The dumbest of the three. 2/5 <BR>18. Two Words - It featurs Mos Def and Freeway. This is an awesome song. \\"Two words, Chi Town, Southside, Worldwide cuz I rep that 'till I f*cking die.\\" 4/5 <BR>19. Through The Wire - This is the First single off the album I think. He spits this one while his face is pretty much wired shut after his accident. This is an awesome track. \\"My story on MTV but I ain't tryin' to make the band.\\" 4.5/5 <BR>20. Family Business - This is my favorite song on the album. Itsreally down to earth. \\"There that one Auntie I dont wanna be rude, but every holiday nobody eatin' her food.\\" 5/5 <BR>21. Last Call - This track is really long. First it has 3 minutes and 56 seconds of a song thats pretty good. Then there is 8 minutes and 40 seconds of Kanye talkin about how he got into the business. It's actually really interesting and some parts are funny. 3/5 for the song and 4/5 for the talking part for the final score its a 3.5/5 for the whole track. 3.5/5 <BR>Top five tracks are:<BR>5:Through The Wire<BR>4:Breathe In Breathe Out<BR>3:Jesus Walks<BR>2:Slow Jamz<BR>1:Family Business <BR>Album over-all score not what it says at the top as a 5/5 but close. 4.5/5
B00005JLRT|5.0|I am not going to argue if the film's plot is like another.  I don't watch a film to hold comparisons.  I judge the film strictly on its merits.  And frankly, I really enjoyed this ST entry.  I love the series and have always thought the films never reached the greatness of the series that spun them.  It was bigger, fancier, but ST always revolved around the people not the plot.  And in that this film is one of the best ST films.<br />It maintains that esprit de corps and spectacular film.  Maybe expectations hurt this.  Everyone went in expecting this or that from the film.  I did not, so I truly enjoyed it.  I have watched if several times and each time I am impressed.<br />So kick by and stop analyzing and enjoy the fun.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I first fell in love with Rufus Wainwright on his second album, &quot;Poses.&quot;  I recently purchased his first and third albums, and &quot;Want One&quot; is by far my favorite.  Rufus's style, music, and lyrics have evolved so much on this album.  He really shows us what he's about, and what his life has been about the past couple of years.  He'll have you right from track one all the way to the end with &quot;Dinner At Eight.&quot;  Rufus Wainwright is truly a musical genius, and I eagerly wait the release of his next album!

B000089RVR|5.0|What can I say? Dido's newest CD &quot;Life For Rent&quot; is an absolute hit. It's different from her debut album &quot;No Angel&quot;, but in a good way. Like myself you will want to listen to this CD every second of every day. Every single one of her songs are incredible, but the ones that take the cake are &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot; and &quot;See The Sun&quot; &quot;See The Sun&quot; is my favourite song of hers, and if you wait about 3-4 minutes after its done you'll hear a ghost track called &quot;Closer&quot; &quot;Closer&quot; is an amazing love song and I know it'll be my wedding song! &quot;Life For Rent&quot; really showcases Dido's talents. She has amazing vocals and she's also really good at song writing. She is just drop dead gorgeous. She's my hero, role model, mentor, and idol. I have so much admiration and respect for this lovely and talented young woman. I swear that if you don't like Dido and you listen to this CD you'll become a fan. She is an all around talented person. I attended her concert and it was awesome. This CD is great for all your moods, whether it be anger, heartbreak, or love. It will be hard not to listen to any other CD besides &quot;No Angel&quot; The follow up to her first album is a complete sucess. There will never be another Dido Armstrong. She is the best and most talented singer in the history of music. I recommend this CD to anyone, Dido fan or not. You'll enjoy it anyday anytime. Now if you'll excuse me I must go put in &quot;Life For Rent&quot; in my CD player and listen to it. Dido, if you ever read this...I LOVE YOU! You're the best. Remember, don't forgot to buy this CD whenever you have the chance. If it cost $100.00 it be worth it. Good-bye everyone. YAY Dido!
0765310015|5.0|I bought this book because of the rave reviews this series was receiving from its European release and its comparisons to George R. R. Martin's A Song of Fire and Ice.  I was worried by the fact that this series is already at 5 or so books which were being written at a pretty quick pace.  I feared it would contain more of the cliffhangers, slow moving plots and the fantasy series cliches I had come to despise.  I was pleasantly surprised by this book.<br />There were no young boys destined to be the savior of their people (at least not in this book), there was a great sense of grit, realism, and history to the world,  there were non-human races that are creative at interesting (ie not more elves, dwarves, ents, orcs etc...), the magic system was very intriguing( the mages draw on \\"warrens\\" which are places of magic and home to the gods) I especially liked the Tarot cards.  I can't wait to find out more about the differnt houses of gods and how the magic system works in subsequent books.<br />The best aspect of this book , however, was the characters.  From the cynical, seasoned veteran Whiskeyjack to an insane puppet to the conflicted Adjunct of the Empress to the mysterous Kruppe (one of my favorite characters ever) all the characters come to life and are emotionally engaging.<br />I cannot wait to read the rest of the books, hopefully since they're already released over seas they will appear in the Sates quickly.
B00008H2LB|5.0|All you people sayin that LP sucks, you obviously must be brain-dead. Either that, or you have to be the most ignorant numbskull on the face of the earth. The cold, hard truth is that Linkin Park is simply a lot better than that poppish BS you probably listen to. Both Hybrid Theory and Meteora are rock solid LP achievements. Meteora has the perfect blend of rap/rock, soft/aggresive. And may the good lord help you if you disagree.
B00006V9A0|1.0|nirvana is one of the worst bands to come out of seattle, EVER. i think curt shooting himself was the best career move he could have made. his voice is whiney and sounds like he recorded all of his songs while letting one out on the john. <br />this cd is probably the worst nirvana cd because it has all their crappy songs that i have been forced to listen to on the radio for years all on one cd.
1594200106|5.0|Slipping into this wondrous novel is like slipping into a warm bath for your mind and soul.  This is the art of literature at its best, and an entertainment that is exhilerating, honest, fun.  You'll feel great reading and for having read this book.
B000069HK2|5.0|this band is truely amazing. they have overcome so many obsticles in their lives such as drug addictions and being homeless and it makes their music that much stronger. the lyrics are amazing...&quot;white it out like glittering wax butterflies&quot; is my favorite lyric of all time. <br />and berts voice is just powerful. wether he is screaming his lungs out until he literaly pukes or melodicly singing softly...he takes my breath away. <br />i was priviliged to see this band at the warped tour and they stole the show. it was amazing. bert is a true entertainer. he does backflips and speakerdives off into the crowd. they were by far the most entertaining band at warped tour. and the most talented.<br />this cd is worth every penny. you will burn holes in it from listening to it so much.
B0002234LS|1.0|Yes, Timothy Hutton did a film very, very similar back in 1993. Remember \\"The Dark Half\\" (Stephen King also wrote it)? To add insult to injury, Timothy Hutton also has a role in this film. I guess this is the director's way of rubbing the film's lack of originality in some of our faces! Think about it! What has Hutton done lately to earn a role in a Depp film? The only thing really spooky about this \\"horror-ibly\\" predictable film is the fact that it was only rated one percent higher than its predecessor over at Rotten Tomatoes! Spooooky! I guess the apple really doesn't fall too far from the tree! <BR> In all honesty it wouldn't be a bad film if one hasn't already seen \\"The Dark Half\\" (or Fight Club for that matter). The acting isn't that bad and it does provide a couple of \\"uncomfortable\\" moments. Even so, it is still far from being great and barely stands in the shadow of being a good one! If you desire to watch a film that has the potential to make you fidget in suspense and make your eyebrows raise a little, watch one of these:<br />Numbered but in no real order...<br />1. The Eye: The Japanese are proving that they are now the new kings of the \\"spooky\\" suspense genre!<BR>2. Ju-on: Also Japanese, also in the theaters.<BR>3. Uzumaki: Japanese due out July 6th of '04. All about the freaky!<BR>4. The Changeling: Yes, even the Canadians can pull one off once in a while. Admittedly, this one came out more than a while ago!<BR>5. The Haunting: Not the Zeta-Jones one but the good one from the 60's! <BR>6. St. John Wort: More Japanese creep! <BR>7. Black Sabbath: A little Italian spooky suspense!<BR>8. Vertigo, The Birds, North by Northwest, Psycho and any other Hitchcock thriller! <BR>9. The Bad Seed<BR>10. \\"The Dark Half\\" or \\"In the Mouth of Madness\\". Neither one is an exceptional movie but they will expose how uninspired this film really is!
0802130208|4.0|One note:  If you haven't finished reading a book, you should not write a review.  It's been about 2 years since i first read this book, and I just recently started reading it again.  But in that time, i've read many of the reviews, positive and negative, on this site.  I get confused by them.  When reviewing a book, especially one with as much hype this one has garnered, bold faced statements of &quot;Oh, my god, it's amazing...Read it!!!&quot;, or, &quot;this book is awful, don't read it&quot; have no place or context.  <BR>I enjoyed the book because it did make me laugh consistantly and uproariously, while still maintaining a theme about an ego-centric slob with an inability to coexist with society in any sort of rational way.  A theme that's quite relevent in today's culture, as well as in the past.  <BR>I can't really comment on the downsides of this book, as I don't see any.  What some of the better negative reviews have to say revolve around the absence of plot and repetitive circumstances.  The plot, in simple terms, is this:  Ignatius has no job, his mother &quot;forces&quot; him to get one, his reaction against and to the various jobs creates situations in which Ignatius must ultimately vacate the world he lives in or be destroyed.  <BR>The repetitive circumstances, and I agree they exist, I believe help the novel show the reader what a jerk Ignatius is.  he refuses to change, but that doesn't mean the people and world around him don't.  Just look at his mother, the police officer, and Jones.  They all change throughout the novel, which I believe is why people enjoy them so much over Ignatius.  <BR>A friend recommended this book to me while browsing in a bookstore.  I had never heard of it, and my friend simply said, &quot;You need to read this.&quot;  I think people do need to read this novel, whether to like it or hate it, because the one thing I'm certain of, you'll never forget it, or Ignatius.
B0001YRVN4|1.0|Guess I will have to hang on to my orginal VHS tapes awhile longer because there is no way I am buying this bastardized version on DVD.  Just wait- they will come around and release the original after everybody buys these.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|This movie was full of tension and suspense right up to the last 10 minutes. Then the cliched, trite, stupid ending came and completely ruined it. Seriously, I enjoy dark movies like American Beauty but Mystic River is completely overrated. It's as if they tried out a bunch of different endings on some focus groups and picked the one that was the most tidy and that everyone could understand. Nice job Clint. I'm glad I only rented this garbage.
B0002234LS|5.0|i LOVED this movie. it was really funny, and also kinda on-the-edge-of-your-seat scary. I recomend this movie to anyone, and of course Depp fans like myself. Come one, come all and sit down to see a wonderful new film!
