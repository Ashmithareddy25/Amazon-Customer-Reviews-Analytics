0385333846|2.0|I really have some questions for Mr. Vonnegut, but I just learned that he passed away last year, in our Earthling's terms anyway. But I figured I should post a review with questions anyway as I am sure he will swing back from time to time (should I even mention \\"time\\"?) to check out these reviews. And so it goes.<br /><br />OK, OK, I get your main point, \\"war is bad\\". I can also get over the ambiguity whether Billy Pilgrim was demented or really could travel in time -- I guess it could really go either way and that is part of the magic of the book. Fine. But let's see, if the main point is that \\"war is bad\\", yet another point is that \\"things happened because they were bound to happen, and they would always happen\\", then what are we supposed to conclude? Should we try to avoid wars, or should we just let them happen? I also get this from the book: we should just look at the happy moments in life (or throughout the history of the universe) and ignore the bad moments. So are we supposed to just let wars happen but look the other way?<br /><br />So, Mr. Vonnegut, please swing back from the purple light and answer my questions. Of course, I understand you may already have answered my questions, as you always would, but I just can't see that moment yet. Please kindly post a comment if you happen to swing back, as I am a poor Earthing who can't see the future.<br /><br />Meanwhile, all I have to say is: \\"Poo-tee-weet!\\".<br /><br />And so it goes.
B00009W0U4|1.0|I am telling you and warning you, this is the most horrific, disturbing, depressing, and EFFECTIVE film ever committed to celluloid. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. I watched it because I heard all the hype about it, and I am sure that is the reason you will watch it too.        All I can say is that it is probably the only film out there that I might tell someone not to watch. I am not calling this a bad film or a good film. It is effective. During the rape scene you feel like you are right there with Monica Belucci. After I watched it I wanted to go out and kill someone with my bare hands, I was bloodthirsty. I was so angry that such things can be done to innocent people. I have never had such an emotional response to a film, and I watch A LOT of films. It made me feel like the world was a horrible place filled with horrific people. Not a good feeling. I will never watch this film again. Proceed at your own risk.
B00006I53S|5.0|The standard lens that accompanies the EOS range is a 18 to 55 mm lens and this really has a limited range. Newcomers will be tempted to buy a larger lens next but this one is the way to go. Yes the ranges overlap, but with the 28-135 mm lens you have all you need when you need it. Capable of landscape to portrait and you will never need to change it. The 28-135 mm will be your primary lens for sure.    On a technical note, this lens is the fastest and most silent lens I have had the pleasure to use.
B000REYUKU|5.0|This is great.  the old CP-E3 was a great unit, but the new and sealed CP-E4 is even better.  If you shoot weddings or any type of event, this is a must have!  And now that its sealed also, that means you can shoot in mist and drizzle and not have to worry about it.  Its a perfect add on to the sealed 580 EX II and the 1D Mark 3.<br /><br />I also use mine with my twin tube Macro lite, the MT-24Ex.<br /><br />If you use a newer flash, and for the faster recycle and longer battery lifer you should be, then you need this Battery Pack!  If you ever shoot in cold weather, this is even more of a must have!!!!!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|While Persuasion is my favourite Jane Austen book, this film is definitely not my favourite adaptation of Jane Austen's excellent novel.      For the most part, the actors did a great job, especially the leads.  It's been a long time since I've watched the 1995 version of the film, so I can not compare but Rupert Penry-Jones made a wonderful Wentworth.  I was very tempted to give this film only one star but Rupert Penry-Jones and Sally Hawkins' performances made me refrain from being so harsh.    Unfortunately, I found the film very abridged and the movie skipped forward very rapidly.  A lot was left out including the details of Wentworth and Anne's first meeting and the back story to do with Mrs. Smith.  And as one reviewer already noted, Anne's behaviour at the ending was definitely out of character and not at all how she would have acted.    The cinematography also left much to be desired.  Many of the shots were jarring from one character to another and the transitions between scenes were poorly done.  The close up shots were overused and it would have much improved the film if we didn't spend so much time looking at the backs of people's heads.  All in all, I found the cinematography quite disconcerting.    I was very excited to see Persuasion again but after viewing this version I was left totally unsatisfied.  I guess I'll have to sate my craving elsewhere.
0740748475|5.0|I had no idea how heavy those books are. They are beautifully printed, Hardcover Books. It was a present for my son. He is reading every morning and before he goes to bed. Even my husband got into it. The Cartoons contain some big words. Now my son would like a digital dictionary for his room, so can look up the words he doesn't know quickly!
1400079179|2.0|Every time I begin reading a bestseller, I try to put aside my prejudices about popular books. But every time my instincts about the popular come out to be quite right. It was the same with Da Vinci Code. I read the book quite later than when it was at the height of its reputation (or hype should I say?) and I had already heard some bad reviews about its content. But I found it lacking not only in content but also in literary merit. As one of the early reviewers said, the book reads like a screenplay except for the requisite style details. While we are following Robert Langdon and Sophie in their one (or two day) adventure, the story shifts to albino monk Silas and Bishop Aringarosa just as a camera shifts onto different scenes in a film. The characters are shallow and nothing more than plot devices. This is true for one of the main characters, Sophie aas well. She is supposed to be an intelligent cryptologist but she appears to be just another damsel in distress and she can't even figure out anagrams. She is just there because Langdon needs someone to talk about secret sects and symbols and other nonsense. Dan Brown is talking to us through Langdon and he is doing it in a very irritating manner. \\"The corridor's of Louvre's Grand Gallery is as large as three what's-its-name monuments in Washington DC.\\" or \\"Everyone thinks this word's origins are this but in fact it is that\\" blah blah blah.<br /><br />The very powerful secret organizations seem to be run by idiots who send an conspicuous outcasts to the most important jobs in the world and fanatical English aristocrats set up some far-fetched plots to lure people into their lair. The French head of police is made to be an idiot. It seems the only clever person in the whole universe is Dan Brown.<br /><br />Dan Brown wants to tell us his conspiracy theories and concocts some implausible scenario so that it will look like a thriller. All in all a very forgettable book that does nothing to dispel my negative opinions about popular literature.rature.
B00005LC1H|4.0|For anyone who loves Monty Python or British comedy in general, Fawlty Towers is absolutely worthwhile. John Cleese is hilarious as always, this time playing an over-stressed, henpecked hotel manager. The supporting cast is wonderful as well. I would highly reccomend this collection.

0765317389|5.0|This is a great book for youth and adults, and for families that enjoy reading together. Intense, surprising, disturbing, raising questions of ethics and projecting our imaginations into a future that is not so far away.  It is also a book about leadership, power, family, and understanding differences.
0439882826|5.0|Very pleased with the condition of the book. And most important, just what my grandson wanted!
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I have many of these pieces performed by other artists such as Horowitz, Richter, Argerich, and Brendel, but I find myself listening to Uchida more than any of the others.  I like her blend of precision, tempi, chiaroscuro of mood, and dynamics. The clarity of the recording is also exceptional.    I am in complete agreement with Frank Bunyard's remarks, especially the \\"spiritual channeling\\" of the composer that Uchida accomplishes. To hear her is to participate in a celebration of the \\"miracle\\" of Mozart!
B000BISBDY|4.0|My husband and I really enjoy this CD.  I actually just became a fan of Johnny Cash after seeing Walk the Line.
B000654OUG|5.0|Although I have most of the pieces in this collection in performances by other artists such as Horowitz, Richter, Pollini, and Brendel, I find myself listening to Uchida more than any of the others. Her interpretation suits my liking for precision, tempo, and chiaroscuro of mood and dynamics. I come to trust her more and more.  I also recommend her Mozart collection.
0061122416|5.0|If I had the money, I would buy everyone I know a copy of this book!  A wonderfully written parable, the reader is taken on a mythic journey with a boy who is coming of age.<br /><br />This is a journey that all of us hold within our heart and spirit. The journey of knowing our life's purpose and path.  So often, what we believe we need or want appears so far away when in reality, it is right in front of us.<br /><br />Beautifully written with captivating prose and genuine passion, Coelho's classic appeals to the \\"human spirit\\" in all of us.<br /><br />When I am looking for a book to 'refuel' me, I go back to this priceless volume!  Enjoy it!
1847242537|5.0|Yes, it's that good.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomquist is hired by a business tycoon to investigate what happened to his nice who vanished a long time ago. He teams up with hacker Lisbet Salander, who is a great character.<br /><br />Imagine a story that diggs into the one family's darkest seacret. A story that makes twists and turns you wouldn't expect. And imagine a grown up Pippi Longstocking teaming up with journalist Blomquist to solve the mystery.<br /><br />This is one of the best mystery books ever written. This is blockbuster material. Be patient through the first chapters, before the story really takes off. It will be well worth it!

B000VNMMR0|3.0|Of course, the Unrated version allowed John McClain to deliver his infamous \\"Yipee Ki-yay, MF\\" line, unlike the watered down theatrical version.  However, there were other scenes that were very different as well.  I think I liked the theatrical version better honestly!  It was good for the action, and I loved the on-screen duo of the Mac guy (Justin Long) and Bruce Willis.  Justin balanced out the over-the-top toughness of Willis and really made us laugh.  Such a cutie.    If you wanted to, you could poke all kinds of holes.  And the fighter jet scene?  Come on.  But, it was certainly very entertaining and the helicopter scene was awesome.
6304936362|5.0|It has all the new \\"RAT PACK\\" from the 90's and 2000.  It was good and one of the best WWII movies for airplane battle fights I ever saw.  It is not the documentary and that has an awesome review too, my friend 43 yrs service retired now Aircraft mechanic wanted this for his birthday and said \\"It was one of the best MOVIE dogfights I have ever seen!\\"  This man went through Veitnam and Korea.  Full of tons of stars that we all know most became famous all star cast and a story well told and lived.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|If you have a home theatre, this is a MUST OWN.  And the bonus features are great, especially the behind-the-scenes stuff.

B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|I've gamed with my share of psychic characters in various modern-day role-playing games, but for some reason male precogs has never gotten the same attention from Hollywood.  The clairvoyant types are always women or kids who talk to ghosts, with the exception of Stir of Echoes...which was about a guy who talked to ghosts. It was high time we had an action-packed, testosterone-injected update of the typical precog movie.<br /><br />Our hero, Chris Johnson (Nicolas Cage) is wandering around Vegas performing magic tricks.  Something is keeping him there: normally, Johnson can only see a few minutes into the future.  But when he encounters (or will encounter) Liz Cooper (the delectable Jessica Biel) at a diner, he discovers he can see his future with her, and only with her.  At heart, Next is a star-crossed romance.<br /><br />What's entertaining about this somewhat flimsy premise is that Johnson can make it work.  Nobody as hot as Cooper would normally be interested in shlubby Johnson, but he keeps trying alternate approaches, visualizing an endless array of possibilities, until he hits on the tactic that will work.<br /><br />As you can imagine, precognition is a lot like time travel, and it's difficult to visually pull off.  Next does an excellent job of showing what Johnson sees and the innovative ways he uses his gift; at one point, we see him splitting into multiple selves (representing all the possibilities of a particular course of action).  In combat, this is really fun to watch - since Johnson can see when someone will throw a punch, he can easily dodge the blow.  He can even dodge bullets.<br /><br />Into this tidy romance steps Callie Ferris (the usually gorgeous Julianne Moore, who looks terrible in this movie), a federal agent bent on using Johnson's powers to stop a nuclear bomb from going off.  The plot spins from there. The terrorists, who are tracking Ferris, figure that Johnson must be important because the government wants so desperately to speak with him, so they try to kill Johnson.  In other words, the movie is something of a closed loop - the whole reason Johnson gets involved is because people THINK he might be important, and thus he becomes important.<br /><br />Next has its flaws, however.  For one, Cage acts like he's in a daze.  His character is bland, confused, and a little addled - not in a cool, I-have-mental-powers sort of way, but an old-man-who-forgot-his-meds sort of way.  It's not very appealing, and strains the credibility of any attraction that Biel's character would have to him.<br /><br />Speaking of Biel, she's simply too attractive for the role.  At the time of the film, Biel was 25, Cage was 43.  They seem wildly mismatched in age, personality, and temperament. Biel does a good job acting bewildered and enchanted, but she's essentially making goo-goo eyes at a walking, talking zombie.<br /><br />The other problem is that Next simply doesn't have enough of a budget to pull off all the really cool special effects in the film.  The worst is when Johnson drives a stolen car in front of a train; the train, the car, and the crash look like they were made on a Commodore 64.  It takes away from an otherwise riveting scene.<br /><br />The bad guys are non-descript Eurotrash.  Their motivation is vague, although they seem to be so powerful that the bad guys even shadow the feds without being noticed.  No wonder the only person who can defeat them is a psychic!<br /><br />When Johsnon and Ferris team up, things really get going.  There's nothing like watching a precog and a sniper work in tandem.  Or a precog wending his way through a maze trapped with bombs.  Or a precog...well, you get the picture.  It's fun stuff.<br /><br />Throughout the movie, Next plays fast and loose with the timeline.  At any point in time, we're never sure if we're seeing the future or if Johnson is actually experiencing the future.  Depending on your perspective, this is either an interesting twist on the action genre or really annoying.  The ending pivots on the phrase, \\"I made a mistake...\\"<br /><br />Was it a mistake?  I don't think so.  This little movie works with what it has.  Sometimes it might overreach, but for the most part it's an exciting science fiction action thriller.Was it a mistake?

B000UR9T8C|3.0|I have come to the conclusion that if you are a superhero with a 'secret' identity, you ought to leave your mask on.  Of course, green goblin, and venom, and mary jane, and harry, and god knows who all else know it's peter, so why bother with the suit at all, but seriously Toby is a big star and his agent won't let him wear a mask for more than 30 seconds in the whole film, fine, but it makes the movie seem dumber than it normally would.  Not Fantastic Four dumb, but dumb nonetheless.    Highs :  Well, none really, but pretty even throughout.    Lows :  Venom looked wimpy.  Continuity, how did Brock imitate spiderman before he had superpowers, or did I doze off?

B00006LSZ4|1.0|Disney should be ashamed of releasing this film in such a manner.  The master they used is outdated and not even anamorphic.  The master, and all bonus materials were originally produced for a $100 Laserdisc release done over 8 years ago!  The same is true for other Disney films like SISTER ACT, ARACHNOPHOBIA, THE BLACK CAULDRON, THE JOY LUCK CLUB   Other studios remaster often, expecially when doing a release in a new format.  With these kind of choices being made by Disney I wonder what they are going to pull with Blu?

B00005R23X|4.0|I had purchased the new Special Edition of this film and was horrified to find it lacking in quality.  This Superbit Edition may not have the extras of the new release but it hands above the the new one.  Color and clarity out shine the newer release.  The Special Edition is dark and colorless.  I saw this film in the theatre and it's didn't look like the Special Edition.  I also owned the old Laser release and it too look good.  It's really sad that SONY/Columbia re-mastered the film in hi-def (Blu-ray) and it looks so bad.  When I tried to get this Superbit Edition at my local store I was told it was taken off the shelves and sent back due to the newer Special Edition.  I was lucky enough to find in on Amazon.  It was sent out quickly and arrived fast.
B00005JPUN|5.0|Someone must defend the exquisite \\"The Invasion\\", which was a huge critical and commercial disaster when released in 2007. Personally, I think it was way ahead of its' time, and it is quite ironic that most people are waking up to its' genius on DVD.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman, in perhaps her most restrained performance plays 'a woman against the world'. Holding onto her sanity while the rest of the world around her are converted literally into zombies, she plays a simple woman who has to deal with some extraordinary circumstances. I found her insomniac performance while teetering on the verge of a nervous breakdown while trapped in the convenience store, to be one of her greatest screen moments.<br /><br />Its moments like that which define \\"The Invasion\\". This is NOT a film for special effects afficionados. In fact, I can't recall even one significant special effect or 'things blowing up'. What I got instead was a quiet, intelligent science fiction thriller that relied upon dialog and languid camera movement to convey a sense of fear and mayhem. In fact, the Directors' style here is an amalgamation of David Lynch and two of his best movies - \\"Dune\\" and \\"Mulholland Drive\\". The film-noir vibe is stark throughout this film, and I would say this is closer to an art film that a typical commercial thriller.<br /><br />Perhaps its that sensibility that made this a commercial failure. In one extended sequence, Nicole Kidman is informed that in order to escape being noticed by the zombies, you need to be 'emotionless'. Nicole then proceeds to take the train and walk the streets, and does a fine job of conveying nothingness, simply to escape being killed, while all the while her character is dying inside. Superb.<br /><br />The end could have been better, yes, and in fact even I was surprised at how conveniently they wrapped things up just to finish the film off. But thats a minor quibble. I preferred this vastly over last years \\"Children of Men\\", which I would call \\"The Invasion\\"'s poorer cousin. For the life of me, I cannot comprehend the negativity this film attracts when in fact its certainly a science fiction classic and clearly the best film made on the Invasion theme so far.<br /><br />There is a film from 1994 - \\"Body Snatchers\\", which had the same storyline. That was another minor masterpiece that no one noticed (try looking for the DVD, it starred Gabrielle Anwar in her defining role). Its unsung movies like these that are present in the science fiction genre, and true fans of the medium such as myself will always be there to give them the respect they deserve.<br /><br />Ignore the negativity, and BUY this on DVD today. Its certainly worth watching more than once, and will quickly become one of your favorite movies if you give it a chance.<br /><br />Five Stars.ife of me, I cannot comprehend the negativity this film attracts when in fact its certainly a science fiction classic and clearly the best film made on the Invasion theme so far.

B000G8NY4U|5.0|I had high expecations for this DVD based on buyer's reviews. I have to say that I was not dissappointed! The mix of instruments, sound quality and awesome stage light show are fun to watch. I've listened to Yanni for years and to see the concert on stage in this quality is really inspiring. There is amazing talent and an array of instruments filmed with a good mix of close-ups, and widescreen views. This is not in the least boring to watch. And the sound quality is top notch. Very professional production.
0307387151|3.0|I read 'Atonement' upon first release, and with the gift of time, I can say that this is a story that grows upon you months after you've read it. Ian McEwan is a great writer, no doubt, and his overly emotional story here is a bit too melodramatic at times, but you cannot deny the power of his writing.<br /><br />The central heroine here, Briony Tallis, is introduced to us as being a combination of all sorts of virtues and shortcomings. In his effort to present her as a likeable, everyday sort of heroine, I regret that McEwan reduced, at some point, his lead character to some sort of caricature. I don't know if other readers have had this problem, but I certainly did.<br /><br />Also, did anyone else have an issue with the elaborate usage of imagery when describing places or the immediate environment? I loved it for the first forty pages, but after a point this became very, very tedious indeed, as it seemed the author was sacrificing readability in favor of his fascination for his own writing. Well, if I wrote this well, I would probably spend hours describing linen or the clouds bursting with acrimonious aqua, etc, but I think it got in the way of a credible reading experience, for me.<br /><br />The lead review on Amazon for \\"Atonement\\" reads - \\"If God were a Novelist\\". I am very surprised at such glowing praise for this book. I was discussing this with a friend of mine and we both thought that if you took the glorious language away, the plot itself was very weak and uninteresting. Seriously, if you placed Danielle Steel about sixty years back, she would come up with stories like this. However, like all proper classics, \\"Atonement\\" now has the benefit of a major motion picture behind it, and perhaps all the glowing reviews are from people more swayed by Keira Knightley's ethereal beauty, rather than them having read the book.<br /><br />I am glad I read this book before the movie version came out. I haven't seen the film, but would like to. I would like to see how they present the older Briony, in her 'writer' phase. For readers and followers of books that normally make various awards long-lists and short-lists, the writing here very closely reminded me of Alan Hollinghurts's \\"Line of Beauty\\" that was busy garnering praise a few years ago. The attention to detail and the obsession with plot specifics will remind you of that novel in more ways than one.<br /><br />This book also reminds of \\"Possession\\" by AS Byatt, which was a gorgeously written book, but found very few takers due to its slow, languid pace. When they made it a film with Gwyneth Paltrow, book sales soared, but I am yet to find people who love that book on its' own merits. I certainly did.<br /><br />\\"Atonement\\" may not be for you if you are not a fan of long-winded passages and attention to decription. This is by no means a straight forward book or story, though the tale it contains is actually quite generic. Approach it with a resolve to devote two or three solid days to relish it - read it slowly with a glass of wine - and you will reap its' riches.in her 'writer' phase.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|The first song I heard from this album was \\"Map of the Problematique\\"; just the tone of the track was enough for me to buy the cd. I hadn't previously heard of Muse so I was a bit skeptical because of the \\"buy the album for one song and the rest of it is terrible\\", but I went ahead and purchased it anyways.    The First Track, \\"Take A Bow\\", was reminiscent of the one I had heard, but the thing that struck me the most was while it shared similarities, it's tone was completely different yet still entertaining; this was true with pretty much every other track, from \\"Knights Of Cydonia\\"(one of my favorites in Guitar Hero III as well as on real guitar) to \\"Invincible\\".    The album flows very well, has solid instrumental riffs with none of the gawdy Yngwie Malmsteen sound, and was well worth the time to give it a chance. 5/5
1400063515|4.0|You have to make decisions in the face of uncertainty: about your career, mortgage, insurance and lifestyle. We used to be well adapted to the statistics of the environment when we lived in tribal societies, but the advent of scalability has thrown us into a different world with new rules that strain the brain. Taleb shows how this change of environment impacts your decision making and perception of events.<br /><br />He has good news and bad news: A highly improbable event, a so called Black Swan, can cause catastrophe when it sweeps you off the ground you thought you knew. Examples from finance are the market crash of 1987 and the subprime crisis. But those who get the new rules can act counter-intuitively, in some situations, for protection. He also shows how to expose yourself to extremely profitable opportunities without effort.<br /><br />This book shows it: Nobody Knows Anything. This is scary when it concerns important things like career and lifestyle. The statistical concept of the bell curve does not apply to modern life events. Now we live with geometrical fractals, so the winner takes all where mediocrity used to rule.<br /><br />Choose actively between strategies: Bleed or Blowup. Then profit from positive accident with the Barbell strategy. These concepts are useful beyond finance. Happiness and safety depend on how you relate to the world, so you better know how to expose yourself to luck.<br /><br />One little thing: Taleb often moves from the main argument with anecdotes from his life. This is usually a helpful illustration, but sometimes an annoying distraction. He shows a high opinion of himself, something that could insult the reader. The establishment of statistics was unfairly critical of his ideas, and this carved a sharp edge in his character. But let's forgive him, because his last digressions make up for the annoyance. He concludes the book with two profound statements:<br /><br />\\"Don't run for trains.\\"<br />\\"Don't sweat the small stuff.\\"<br /><br />I could only really believe that after reading this book.ading this book.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Even though this was recommended by a friend, I didn't expect much from the creator of \\"Buffy\\" (but to be fair, I've only seen one or two Buffy's).  Plus, I didn't know anything about the series it was based on, so I expected to, at best, not get the in-jokes, and at worst to be totally lost w/regard to the plot.    Instead, this turned out to be one of the most pleasant surprises in a while.  They managed to convey the essentials of the characters and plot very early on, and the humor was fully enjoyable.  Don't get me wrong --- I intend to watch all the Firefly episodes and then watch this again, but the episodes are definitely not a prerequisite.    Best of all was the INTELLIGENCE of the characters.  How many movies have you seen where the plot depended on characters acting like dummies most of the time, not seeing very obvious ramifications of actions or events?  This was such a refreshing change --- everyone in the movie was smart, and surprises to the characters were surprises to the viewer as well.    I never heard of \\"Firefly\\" while it was on.  I'll be sure to look for more from the creators in the future.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|When my regular MDR7506 earphones broke this summer I knew I would replace them with the same earphones. I was quite pleasantly surprised to find that a larger ear cushion, better suited for my ears, was available with these great earphones. They have been great. The new design for the structure also looks more stable than the older pair that broke. So I am very pleased with this item.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|Many viewers and critics alike felt that Season 3 of LOST failed to meet the bar that had been set during the previous seasons.  Specifically, there were about 6-8 episodes during the middle of the Season that were widely critized for not pushing the story arch forward, focusing on uneventful flashbacks, and containing too many new or inconsequential characters.    Personally, after re-watching the Season, I think that despite the relatively slow middle, Season 3 provides a great deal of content.  The last 6-episodes for example, are among my favorite in the entire series.  And no viewer, fan, or critic can deny the significance of the final episode.    This collection is a \\"must have\\" for any Lostophile.  The special features, and bonus material are of course outstanding; if that's what you are in to.  Casual viewers, or viewers that have not seen all of Seasons 1-2, should really catch up before purchasing or renting this Season.    If you missed out on this Season, get a rush delivery.  Season 4 premeires Thursday, January 31st, 2008; and you don't want to be lost...(pun intended)
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I wasn't to sure at first about watching it. But I love Jack Black. Then I became addicted to watching it evertime it was on. He was such a different character in here that you couldn't help but love him. Kate Winslet is another person I like to watch also. It's just a great comedy/love story. It makes you wonder if it's really that easy just to pack up,go somewhere for 2weeks and find someone special...
B000Y7U98C|1.0|The movie 'Sunshine' is a bad movie; not a bad movie that is entertaining due to it's poor elements but rather this is a large budget movie that plods along never really getting to the point.    The premise is: 1) the sun is dying, 2) Mankind has figured out how to build a bomb which simulates a star being born (on a smaller scale), 3) said bomb will effectively restart the star, 4) a badly designed spacecraft and flight mission can achieve the goal of restarting the sun with basically no redunant systems, 5) Man goes nuts when left alone, and 6) Mankind has become stupid enough to not send adult supervision on the most important space mission in mankind's history.    Given the premise elements, you can predict that there will be problems into the mission forcing the inexperienced crew to do rash and stupid things.  But, can they accomplish the mission?  Do they have the internal fortitude to accomplish the mission?  You will not care as you will be bored out of your mind before the first reel is over!    Normally, I am willing to give a movie a chance to get up to speed. However, this movie never takes it out of first gear.  The pacing is terribly slow, the acting is marginal, character development is weak at best and the characters are not very bright (odd for people who are supposed to be saving the human race).     The movie content is very derivative of good space movies (2001, Outlander, Alien, etc) with some bad techno babble about restarting the sun.  I am not sure what the director is trying to communicate to me.  The visual effects were nothing to get excited about.  I would love to know who 'Green lighted' this movie -- what the heck were you thinking?  Or, were you thinking?  I hope this movie loses big money as the producing and directing team should be ashamed.    Overall rating:  ---------------  Story -- 0.5 stars  Acting -- 1 star  Visuals -- 2 stars  Directing -- 0.5 stars  Action -- 1 star  Characters -- 0.5 stars
0684857219|5.0|I bought this book for my husband because he is into bodybuilding. He reads it all the time.  He has found out so much information that he did'nt know and some that confirmed what he did know.  This book shows proper techniques to use in order to get to the body you would like to be. It also has plans and charts to go by which is a good way to keep up with your training and progress.
B000002J1Y|5.0|I am not a big fan of LIVE recordings.  I tend to stay with the studio works of my favorite artists.  However, with a band like Yes, I continue to be drawn to their music, and with no new music out...I turned to live recordings.<br /><br />This is one of the best compilations of live music by a band.  The performances here are top notch, and the remastered version helps flavor the sound in a sparkling clear manner.  Classic Yes tunes played live from the tour supporting Close To The Edge LP, the Prog-Rock group's classic rock high point.<br /><br />If you like Yes, then this album is a must have!  Or if you like Yes and have Classic Yes CD, then this is essentially the Live version of that album.  This is more or less a best of type compilation, but the live performances here prove to everyone that Yes on tour sounded just as good as they did in the studio!

0316548189|5.0|I read this before my recent trip to South Africa and I'm so glad I did as it made me appreciate this amazing country and its people even more. I think anyone who visits Robben Island without reading this first misses out on an incredible history lesson. This should be required reading in all high schools.    I will admit that it was a long read and difficult to get through at times, but it really demonstrates just how long of a road Nelson Mandela had to travel for his freedom. Amazing, amazing man. I only hope there will be \\"another Mandela\\" to lead this country in the future.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|My nine year old (adopted) nephew recommended for me to buy this movie; usually I don't buy any animation type movie, but, this one changed my mind! I also bought \\"Cars\\", which was also a hoot. I'm glad this movie won a Global award, and would also deserve to win an Oscar. That would make an excellent menu on the table. \\"Of course you're hungry; you didn't buy this movie!\\"
1400063515|5.0|I used examples out of this book the very day I bought it.<br /><br />My job is to advise on business continuity plans, or BCPs. These plans are to help a business survive when disaster strikes. This generally means having a secondary location with server backups, a contact list of all staff members, and a set of plans on how to deal with various scenarios. You wouldn't deal with a fire the same way you'd handle a flu epidemic though either one could destroy your business.<br /><br />This can be a tough sell. Managers and salespeople are edging to get out and do their own work and even in this post 9/11 world they see BCPs as a chore. They don't see a need for them because any single disaster is perceived as so improbable that planning against them is a fruitless expense.<br /><br />I got much help from Taleb's book. His examples and insights forcefully counter this attitude. Here are some examples I gave management during my presentations.<br /><br />* The hero of September 10th. Had some regulator mandated bullet proof doors on all passenger planes by 10 September 2001, then the World Trade Center would probably be standing today, but would we have thanked the regulator? Of course not, we'd have cursed the increase in fuel consumption caused by these heavy doors.<br /><br />* The problem of silent evidence. Cicero asked about a series of portraits and was told that these were grateful pilgrims who had been saved from a storm by praying to the gods. I see, answered Cicero, but where are the portraits of those who prayed and drowned anyway? Evidence of success is seldom mitigated by the often absent evidence of failure.<br /><br />* Power distributions. In Taleb's world (he calls it Extremistan and contrasts it with Mediocristan) events and their impacts are distributed following a power law, or the 80-20 rule. But the 80-20 rule scales up. If 80% of the wealth is held by 20% of the people, then 80% of that 80% (i.e. 64%) is held by 20% of that 20% (i.e. 4%). We should think this way when planning for worst possible cases, that is we shouldn't plan for the worst case we know has happened, we should plan for at least one level up in the 80-20 rule.<br /><br />Taleb's main hobby is to tease people about what they claim to know. He readily says \\"I don't know\\" and advises skepticism towards those who claim they do know. Does it take courage to go to your boss or to a team of managers you are advising and say this? No, it doesn't take courage, it takes tact. We might not know what to expect but we can foster a culture of skepticism and promote it as the best available. We should give up a dangerous sense of false security and simply accept we don't know so that we can absorb as best we can the impact of the next big disaster.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Dublinible cases, that is we shouldn't plan for the worst case we know has happened, we should plan for at least one level up in the 80-20 rule.

B000UO338W|3.0|It's a good album. The first four tracks are great. After that it starts getting tired. A lot of the same sounds. The Roadhouse Blues cover was really stupid filler material. I like Ministry's more experimental days that had more variety. This release isn't as good as Rio Grande. I would still own it, but I would wait and find it used. I would put money on  RC and Lard albums than this one.
B000001F9N|5.0|This album sent me back to my teens! A walk down memory lane....I was able to remember places and friends that I have not tought about in years. Not only for the beautiful music, the feeling Ms. Summer puts in this album gets deep down inside, sexy, fun. I do not get tire of listening to it,specially when I'm driving, it me feel so good, young and alive! Ready for another dance!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This DVD set is worth every penny and then some.  Though it's a depiction, it brings to life what so many endured and, it seems, few of us appreciate.  Those men put their lives on the line for us and many continue to do so today.  The men and women of the military deserve much more respect then they're given.  I thank God for them every day and thank them personally when I cross their paths.
B000WGNLLW|4.0|own most of DD albums and like most fans I prefer old stuff from their early era. After a deceiving decade in the 90s, they came back with the original line-up and the great album Astronaut a few years ago.     Now the guitarist Andy Taylor has left and the band is back with a totally new kind of creation, Red Carpet Massacre, featuring Timbaland and Justin Timberlake (something I would never have expected). Clearly, the band tried to adapt their mucical style to the 2000s tendency. I think the result has worth it. The album features very interesting tracks and sounds fresh, innovative and creative. But it is not for everyone. If you're looking for songs like Hungry Like The Wolf or Save a Prayer, you will be totally lost !!     The album sounds like a creation by a new band except for Lebon's voice and Nick Rhodes synths. If you're a fan you might recongnize the bass line style of John Taylor.     I would recommend people to listen to the album before buying it ! I think this is the kind of \\"love it or hate it\\".     I think the deluxe version is only a good purchase if you are a fan or if you get it at low price.
B00006IU73|5.0|With \\"In Absentia\\" Porcupine Tree moves to a major label and finally starts getting some of the exposure that bring them to a wider audience.  The band's music turns more toward metal and continues to be more commercial, but retains enough of the elements that their early fans admired to remain a more than capable recording unit.  Some older fans of the band found this album to be disappointing while at the same time the disc brought a whole new generation to Porcupine Tree's music.  You have to give Stephen Wilson credit for never staying in the same place musically and constantly tweaking the formula to keep the band modern and fresh.  Personally I don't think this album is quite on the same level as \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" or \\"Stupid Dream\\", but it is nonetheless another great album.  The music on the disc follows a loose storyline of a serial killer.  Wilson and company mesh their psychedelic progressive rock tendencies with a more heavy metallic sound that works very well.  The album is superbly recorded (this is a great headphones disc) and sounds great on a good stereo.  This album is also the first with drummer Gavin Harrison who is an absolute monster on the drum kit.  I thought that Chris Maitland would be difficult to replace, but Harrison does a fantastic job of fitting in and gets better with each album.   This album was a starting point for many Porcupine Tree fans and it does serve as a good jumping off point, but if you are not familiar with the band's older albums I would suggest checking them out.
0439882826|5.0|My nephew thought this was the coolest thing.  He is just starting to read and I think this will be fun material for Mom and Dad to help with.
B00005BIIP|4.0|\\"Recordings\\" is actually an album of outtakes and cuts that did not make the band's official album releases up to this point in their career.  The only exception is an expanded version of the track \\"Even Less\\" (this one over 13 minutes long) that first appeared on the \\"Stupid Dream\\" album.  I have said this before, but the material the Porcupine Tree throws away is better than 90% of most band's legit releases.  I normally avoid outtake and rarities albums like the plague, but with material of this quality it should not be ignored.  I don't think this album ranks up there with the best of Porcupine Tree's official albums, but it is certainly worth owning for the fan.  All that being said, \\"Recordings\\" is currently out of print and copies are selling for over $200.00 right now.  It is a good album, but not that good.
0156907399|5.0|Lauded as a staple of the modernist canon, Woolf's stream-of-consciousness novel of alienation is better appreciated for its exquisitely delicious prose and her ability to invoke the tragic beauty of striving for intimacy and immortality (symbolized by the eponymous lighthouse), only to find it always just beyond one's grasp.  Is there a sadder line anywhere in Western literature than when Mrs. Ramsey is tucking her young son James into bed?  \\"In a moment he would ask her, `Are we going to the Lighthouse?' And she would have to say, 'No: not tomorrow; your father says not.' Happily, Mildred came in to fetch them, and the bustle distracted them. But he kept looking back over his shoulder as Mildred carried him out, and she was certain that he was thinking, we are not going to the Lighthouse tomorrow; and she thought, he will remember that all his life.\\"
B000000WFZ|5.0|The movie was awesome and having the soundtrack is fantastic.  I'm taking some college courses to continue my teaching certificate and I've written over 30 pages while listening to this music.  It is relaxing while being inspirational at the same time - very uplifting.
0307386864|1.0|From Becoming Jane to The Jane Austen Book Club, Me and Mr. Darcy toConfessions of a Jane Austen Addict, 2007 was the year of Jane-mania, sucking out whatever satirical bite Austen might have carried two centuries ago and replacing it with syrupy tote bags and cloying t-shirts that allow a girl to declare herself, \\"An Elizabeth in a Darcy-less World\\" or (more chillingly) \\"Property of Mr. Darcy.\\"  In all the fervor, the only things overlooked were that Austen's prose is overwritten and dry, her plots torturously dull, and her characters one-dimensional clich&eacute;s.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|The Snowman is a mesmerizing animated fantasy. The music is superb and the art is amazing! I have 5 children (who saw it when they were young) and 6 grandchildren who just discovered it. Some of them have watched it over 20 times in the last 2 months. This Christmas I made sure every family had one. Young and old alike -- We all love it! I highly recommend it.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I have always wanted this set after first viewing it on TV. The price was however a big deterent. Then one day I just happened to be browsing on Amazon for some Christmas presents and Band of Brothers dropped from $48 to $25-what a steal!!!

0143038583|3.0|The first half - the evolution of corn and the benefits of eating natural was great.  GREAT information that changes the way I think about all food.    The second half - the part about Michael Pollan's feelings and pages of descriptions about the weirdos he hangs out with was a waste of time.  I don't really need 25 pages about your \\"feeling\\" whilst holding your finger on the trigger of a gun aimed at an animal.      I paid for the whole book but only benefitted from half.  2.5 stars.    Did I just use the word whilst?
1577314808|5.0|This book started me on a path to listen to almost every piece of audio I could find taught by Eckhart Tolle.  His teachings are more than words can describe.<br /><br />My life has change 180 - from depression medication and not caring about living, to really enjoying who I am and really enjoying this dance we call our lives.<br /><br />I feel invincible, now, in that I'm not afraid of much nor do I stress about much.  And, even when I do, it feels like a test and I actually feel good when something that use to be bad comes into my life.  I've tried to share my experience with a few and I've had poor results...lol.  But, anyway, get it and remember that words are like sign posts - they only point to a destination... sometimes people get lost (aka: bad reviews).

0156027321|5.0|The first book I ever fell in love with was \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" by Charles Dickens.  I remember the way it made me feel.  When I was done I wanted to close my eyes and step into this romance I'd come to love.  I never wanted the story to end.  Yet I knew the ending was perfect.  In my mind somewhere in a place of beauty this story existed and continued to thrive.<br /><br />As \\"Life of Pi\\" came to a close my heart was flooded w/the same overwhelming affection.  Every book I've read since my first love has been trying to reach the place \\"Life of Pi\\" was able to awaken.  There were times when I was infuriated w/the author for making me experience such an intense range of emotions in such a short period of time.  I was mad at him for making me love and making me hate so passionately at the same time.  I wanted to throw the book across the room and then dive back into it.<br /><br />If you are a lover of man's perseverance...  If you are a sucker for furry friends...  If you are floored by the power and magnificence of the ocean...  If you love God's greatness... and if you're ready to TRUST an author with your heart... read this book.  I hope you love it, as I have.
1595141715|5.0|As a high school English teacher, I learned about this title from some freshman girls who were reading it one after the other.  I read it in one day.  It's fresh; the format of following the tapes through the thirteen and discovering the reasons adds elements of mystery to a tale of teen woes.  So far, everyone I've given it to has enjoyed it as well.
B000K15VSA|4.0|Truth be told, when I found out about his set, I knew I wanted it.  That said, when I got it, I was pretty excited.  Now that I've opened the case more than a couple of times, I'm happy to say I greatly enjoy this edition of Blade Runner.    As you most likely know, this particular case comes with all five versions of the film, including the Workprint cut, which can only be seen here.  It's a completist's dream!  Also included are a number of goodies, my favorite being a plastic origami unicorn.  The toys are cute, the concept art is strong, but most of all, this has all of Blade Runner.  If you're a fan of the movie in any capacity, I recommend this fervently.  If you're less of a fan than the voracious, such as myself, the four disc set will probably do, or even the Final Cut only version.  But, for those who want the full experience of the finest science fiction film ever crafted, this is money well spent.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Having been a Jane Austen fan for years, I was really looking forward to this movie.  Persuasion is one of my favorite books, and I have read it many times.  However, the movie left a lot to be desired.  While the whole film was rushed and out of order, the ending was the worse.  Why try to cram everything in in the last 10 minutes?   The ending made little sense; it had unnecessary additions, way to much running, and a LAME kiss.  The book ending is perfect, so why they strayed so far from that is beyond me.  While that actors where much more enjoyable to watch then in the 1995 version, I would have preferred that they stay with the book.  The movie lost much of the Jane Austen wit and charm.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|Great service from the seller! DVD and packaging in excellent shape. And, the content was much better than I expected. I bought this for the Pink Floyd reunion and got that and so much more. The quality of the DVD is amazing and the backstage footage is fun - it would be nice to have had more of that, though. It's a phenomonal collection and I'm really glad I purchased it. Thank you, Amazon!
B000VWYJ8G|4.0|The last in the trilogy is a little over the top when it comes to the capabilities of the CIA bad guys but Matt Damon makes it all believable.  Usually when a movie is better than the book that's a bad thing but not in these movies.  Now I own all three.
B000AAJTL6|5.0|Toy Story for PSP is what it is. It's an excellent movie and looks great on the PSP screen. I'd recommend it to anyone on PSP or DVD, but the CG animation really stands out against traditional movies for the PSP.
B000WCDI64|2.0|Based on \\"Frank\\" and \\"Back to Black,\\" I think Amy Winehouse is the most talented, interesting, and entertaining artist to come along in at least 30 years; so I went ahead and ordered this DVD even after reading the review by a fan of my age and gender who said it was too sad to watch.  However, it really is painful to watch, and I doubt I will watch it again. Unfortunately, we can only wait and hope and pray that Amy will get healthy and confident and someday be able to give us live performances that live up to those two albums.  I would advise fans to stick with those CDs and not waste their money on this sad DVD.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard with a movie. And in its soundtrack is part of its experience.    Unlike most movies that only use music as various backgrounds to certain settings, in Juno, it is like watching a montage. It is truly cool.    The presentation for this movie is fabulous. The movie wouldn't work however, if the presentation was all the movie had. Fortunately, the excellent presentation is complimented by a lot of substance.     Part of what makes Juno so much better than every other movie of its kind is its overall accuracy. It wasn't that long ago that I was in high school, and I remember what its like. Unfortunately hollywood has a tendency to fictionalize high schoolers and their personalities. NWith Juno, what we see and hear is true. In fact, a lot of the funniest moments had me saying aloud, \\"That's so true\\" as I laughed. I am not the only one. The theater itself was alive with people making similar remarks throughout the film.    Juno: A witty, intelligent, and humorous presentation that never lacks in compassion regarding its subject matter. These are characters you will feel for. When Juno cries, you will want to cry too. And for that reason, along with everything else I listed, Juno is not just a movie; Juno is an experience. And a very worthwhile one at that!

1594489505|5.0|This was even more gripping than the Kite Runner! If you are interested in gaining a perspective on the cultures in Afghanistan, gaining insight into the Taliban, or if you are interested in reading the perspectives of women in this part of the world (although the author is male) you will love this book! As shown by the success of his first book, this author writes in a way that thoroughly pulls you into the story and leaves you with overwhelming emotions and thoughts. I thouroghly enjoyed it and bought it for my best friend.
B0002Y4TOM|5.0|I was very satisfied with this product.  I ordered it shortly before Christmas (which, as we all know, is probably the worst time to have something shipped).  It arrived expeditiously, and in mint condition.  Since it was a holiday gift, the above-listed details were very important.  I would order from this company again and feel secure knowing that I was getting a good product in a timely manner.
1416500294|5.0|Although written primarily for boys, Treasure Island is one of the few books I remember being wildly excited about as a girl. I decided to share it with my 5 year old (who appreciates a pirate adventure) and I am reading a chapter at a time to him at bedtime. Although it is sometimes a little much for a 5 year old (some deaths and pirates with missing body parts) I can read it in a way that interests him. And, it is a great learning experienced due to this \\"enriched classic\\" version. I can tell my son about real pirates (who he now knows were actually \\"bad guys\\") and about the way things were in the mid 1700's. I explain a lot as I go, but he is fascinated- and we're learning a lot together! I highly recommend it... especially to read to kids slightly older than my 5 year old. However, this works as well!
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you like Zeppelin, you will LOVE this video!! The first 3 hour concert features an 11 minute drum solo by Bonham, as well as an equally impressive guitar solo from Page. They've captured not only the incredible music, but the mood and attitude of the guys when they were first starting their careers - back when their passion for playing oozed out of them with every beat. The footage from the concerts that follow clearly show some of the aspects they \\"upgraded\\" as a consequence of making it big - From simple stage setups to spotlights and spinning stages, from t-shirts and jeans to sequins and leather...this DVD shows you all of it.     Great footage, great sound quality, great purchase! Worth every penny!!

B000Y7U98C|4.0|I'll make this brief.<br /><br />If you liked 'Solaris' with George Clooney, you will likely enjoy this picture alot...<br /><br />And vice-versa.<br /><br />This is a science fantasy drama, a vehicle for metaphors about the Sun, and a collection of character sketches. It's about Icarus falling into the Sun.  And the danger of \\"Staring into the Sun\\".  The ensemble cast perform their parts with grit and seriousness.. the sense of danger and of isolation is palpable... the sets, effects and music are on point.<br /><br />As a mood piece, it excels.<br /><br />As serious 'science fiction'?  Maybe not... but hey- is there really any such thing, anymore?  We're a scientifically jaded culture, now that science is big business.  Yes, jump starting the Sun w/a theoretical fusion bomb is silliness.. but that's just the vehicle to examine these characters- that's what this film is about.

B0002A2WDQ|5.0|Sometimes you just know a film can't get any better.  `Crossroads' is one of them.  Ralph Macchio does a fine job as the young man working toward a dream, and at the same time trying to find the easy way to success by finding that one last, great song by a legendary artist.   Macchio becomes the kid who goes from hospital janitor to thumbing rides to \\"cutting-heads\\" in a dramatic duel against the diabolic favorite.    But Willy Brown, a harmonica playing bluesman played by Joe Seneca, has the one moment which encapsulates the film.  When the girl leaves, Macchio, heart broken, plays Blues guitar for the first time, and Willy Brown says:    Lots of towns  Lots of songs.  Lots of women.  Good times.  Bad times.  The only thing I wanted anybody to say is he could really play.  He was good.     The film is about music, about the Blues.

B000TLTUL0|4.0|Fifteen years ago, Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp) was a successful young barber with a lovely wife and baby daughter; then, everything changed:  A nasty judge (Alan Rickman) sent him to prison and took the wife and baby for his own.  Now Barker's back in London, going by the name of Sweeney Todd, and he's ready for revenge against the judge, his Beadle, and anyone else who crosses him.  He is joined by a partner-in-crime, Mrs. Lovett (Helen Bodham Carter) who helps him dispose of his victims by baking them in meat pies.<br /><br />This musical is almost an operetta, as there is much beautiful singing and little spoken dialogue.  It is stylishly-filmed in near-sepia tones, except for the occasional splatter of blood, which is a lovely nail-polish shade of red.  The sets, lighting, costumes, and makeup accentuate the feeling of madness and desperation, and create a grim fantasy.  Depp sings well and gives a strong performance as the unusual hero, but he didn't fit the role for me (having seen the stage version).  He still looked young enough to play [[ASIN:B00004U8P8 Edward Scissorhands]], whom he strongly resembles here.  Carter is fine as the disheveled pie-maker, but again, I felt there was too much emphasis on the macabre makeup, hair, and wardrobe, and she was too young as well.<br /><br />Overall, it's an impressive film, full of grand music, comic and sinister characters, and a good story about settling old scores.  I didn't find the bloody scenes objectionable, since the whole thing seemed a fantasy and not really scary.
B0000067L3|5.0|Track for track, dollar for dollar, \\"Wheels of Fire\\" is one of the best, most influential and most representative albums of 60's pop rock.  Served up under one cover, you get the best recorded output of guitar god Eric Clapton, the most entertaining and memorable songs of the quirky songwriting team Jack Bruce and Pete Brown, the best singing committed to vinyl by Mr. Bruce, whose blues-tinged alto voice mixed with occasional leaps into falsetto was an extremely sharp instrument for mining a lyric, whether a surrealistic twee poem like \\"As You Said,\\" a double-entrendre-laden satire like \\"Politician,\\" a rock anthem like \\"White Room,\\" or a straight-ahead classic blues number like \\"Born Under a Bad Sign,\\" the unique and overlooked jazz-into-rock drumming of Ginger Baker along with a few of his own forays into surreal poetry; all of that adding up to a 60s album par excellence, a crossroads where the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Muddy Waters and Nick Drake all meet.<br /><br />I hadn't listened to this CD all the way through in a long time, but it gave me chills to hear it again.  All three of its members, separately and together, put their career-best work on this album.  For Clapton, there's room to argue that Derek and the Dominos is on the same level, but this was clearly a high point for Bruce and Baker, who were just as brilliant individual musicians, and the live tracks bring back the high level of improvisational brilliance the trio was capable of, for those of us who couldn't hear it in person.  Listen to these live tracks, then listen to the comparable live recordings of the Stones, Led Zeppelin or the Who. Or even the Grateful Dead, said to be the pinnacle of live noodling. As great as those bands were, they didn't come close to Clapton-Bruce-Baker.  Their studio career wasn't quite as brilliant, but this album is the best of the original collections (best-ofs are the way to go to get the best of the rest).  One thing I notice.  With all the diverse styles Cream tried, they never sounded ponderous.  They were never \\"rock dinosaurs.\\" Baker and Bruce kept them light on their feet, imbuing every track with the graceful drive of jazz no matter what else was going on. That and a sense of humor.they never sounded ponderous.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I've seen this game for a couple of years and hesitated buying it.  I finally broke down and purchased it last week.  I played over the weekend and I love this game.  It's  a lot of fun.  I haven't tried playing with my 9 yr old but I hope she enjoys it too.  It would be nice having a game to play that both of us can have fun with.  I'm a little worn out on the kiddie games like Sorry, Candyland, CHutes and Ladders, etc..  Blokus will have a long shelf life in my house.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|To start things off, I have yet to watch a Danny Boyle film that I didn't like. Sunshine is no exception. I have it right up there with Trainspotting and 28 Days Later as my favorites.<br /><br />The actual idea of taking a voyage to the sun is completely unrealistic to most of the human population, including myself. Recharging the star with a nuclear weapon would also seem like a vain attempt as well. But...you know...maybe one day quests like this could be possible. Possible, not probable. Nevertheless, I commend Danny Boyle for presenting such an idea to film.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy is fantastic, as well as the rest of the cast. The acting definitely boosts the credibility level up a few notches. But really, have you ever seen a Boyle film that didn't have great acting? I can't think of one...because there isn't one. This guy knows how to create a cast, no doubt about it.<br /><br />Visually, Sunshine is downright stunning. I can just imagine Spielberg's envy watching this film. The score is also incredible.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD:<br /><br />My only gripe about Sunshine is the extra astronaut found onboard the Icarus 1. It's not the fact that there was a survivor found...it's the fact that this survivor has no skin! Hey, I'm all for skinless villains...but not in this flick. While it doesn't ruin the movie for me...it does mean that i give it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />All in all, another good one from Danny Boyle.

B000XUUQQK|4.0|I really liked this movie even more than the original. Kept me entertained without dragging on or being too corny (which is the problem with a lot of horror movies nowadays).  The acting was pretty decent; for once there weren't any annoying corny side characters that have no real purpose other than adding to the body count.  The plot was interesting and unique I think-- centered on a group of kids in a psychiatry clinic whose fears ultimately lead them to their demise.  The ending wasn't a complete shocker but I wouldn't call it predictable necessarily... Guess it depends on the person.... Overall I say it's definitely a good DVD to pick up and enjoy on a quiet weekend in with the lights off. Enjoy!
140120306X|2.0|A wholly unsatisfying continuation of a great idea.  Rather than showing us anything that the League did in its centuries of existence - even in what looks to have been eventful decades between the series - we get secondhand reports.  The Dossier itself is a pastiche of different media (an excerpt from a Shakespearean play, various official reports, chapbooks and penny dreadfuls, and even 3D scenes for which the book includes paper glasses) introducing characters who do little and dropping hints of what might have been interesting.  The 80 year jump between volumes is widened by offering very little insight as to how the world has changed - both temporally in terms of the series and in deviating from our own.  There are fewer literary allusions as well compared with earlier books.    It's obvious Moore loves the idea of the League and the literature he parodies, and O'Neil's artwork is probably better here than in the previous issues.  But to set up the chance to meld the comic's concept with Lovecraft (to use one example), only to opt out and mention it in passing, strikes me as a colossal missed opportunity.
B000W07EKW|4.0|Having all threes movies in one box is fantastic but I had noticed at the local Best Buy that for pretty much the same price I could of bought the movies individually. If the bonus disc in this collection was better meaning contained more stuff/better stuff I would give it 5 stars.

First, it ia an in-depth look at the dynamics of and key personalities associated with Lincoln's presidential election.  Look closer (not difficult due to the author's expansive consideration of the players) and you find a fascinating study of leadership excellence, relevant to historic and contemporary times, political and non-polictical environments.
0439882826|5.0|Wow is really all you can say about this incredible pop-up book. This would be a great gift for child and adult alike - anyone who is a Star Wars fan will be amazed by the intricate pop-ups and interesting text.
B000YA9R3C|5.0|What a disturbing, yet brilliant film! This story is certainly a bit overwhelming, and definitely not for the faint of heart!<br /><br />There's one central theme that runs through the Daniel Day Lewis character's life:  financial success at any cost!  He wrecks every human relationship in his adult life. He destroys his health! He suppresses his sexuality. It's obvious he's a homosexual, he shows zero interest in women, but  he can't let any intimate relationships get in the way of success! He rejects his only son over something so trivial it would be laughable under different circumstances. He admits he's full of hate but does nothing to rid himself of  such feelings. He even rejects God and all religion - because he believes in nothing but himself, which in this case is recipe for disaster!<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's a perfect example of the Protestant Work Ethic. He works hard, very hard. He has the single-minded determination to become successful. He's intelligent and knows how to manage people.  He's well spoken and very clever. He successfully manipulates both church and the local community to do his bidding. But in the process he damages the natural environment in orders to make his wealth.  He steals from others because he can get away with it. He uses an innocent child to gain leverage with those around him. Literally anything goes in order to be a financial success.<br /><br />False religion is the other side of this story's coin. Again the Protestant Work ethic is  portrayed as doing whatever it takes in order to succeed . This time it's a preacher who has his eye on the big time. He too knows how to manipulate people to get the wealth and power he wants. While he does not kill anyone like the self-made business man does, and certainly does not deserves his fate, all God means to him is a way of making great wealth. In the end, when that wealth fails him, he admits for the very first time what a foul human being he truly is!<br /><br />This is a very dark cautionary tale about the destructive power of greed and believing that the \\"ends justify the means!\\" What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become corrupt. These two men did not have to become evil in the end! They could have used their  success to the benefit of others - something they apparently never learned how to do! But all they cared about was themselves, which, in the end, led to their mutual destruction!destructive power of greed and believing that the \\"ends justify the means!\\" What makes this tale so incredibly sad is that the preacher's and the business man's life could have turned out so differently if they did not allow themselves to become corrupt.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|This one is the best yet.  I haven't taken this album out of rotation since the download was made available.  Additionally, I purchased the box set directly from W.A.S.T.E and the vinyl does serious justice to the recording...highly recommended while still available...

It is not written as well as \\"A New Earth.\\" I read \\"A New Earth\\" first and then later read \\"The Power of Now.\\" You won't want to put down \\"A New Earth.\\" It is that good and summarizes many of the topics in \\"The Power of Now.\\"

0843174781|4.0|These \\"Mr.\\" and \\"Little Miss\\" books have delighted me ever since I read them to my kids. Written more to be read aloud, they are perfect for 4- to 9-year-olds with a sense of humor. You can almost hear the author smile as the words prod you to turn to the next page. Of course, the story line is completely silly (long-nosed man gets his nose painted, pinched, etc., by his neighbors to help cure his nosiness), but kids seem to love seeing these goofy people learn, through much slapstick, how to tame their excessive behavior. I only wish the female books were \\"Ms. This\\" and \\"Miss That\\" instead of \\"Little Miss.\\" But that's just a wish from Big Ms. Feminist.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I love any and all digital movies and this was no exception.  For anyone who loves cooking or works in a restaurant, this is a must see.  Though some parts were a bit over the top, in the end the message was melt your heart memorable and the jokes were laugh out loud funny!
038073186X|4.0|I'm a sucker for post-war thrillers, and this is one of the best.  After a female prisoner escapes in 1954, Federal Marshals Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule take the ferry to Shutter Island, home of the criminally insane.  What they find is completely baffling. A former code-breaker in WWII, Teddy must decipher the missing prisoner's cryptic messages and unlock the secret of Shutter Island. This creepy place is enough to make anyone on edge, but for Teddy, it brings out his own personal demons: his fear of water and the loss of his beloved wife.  To make matters worse, a furious hurricane is due to hit the island, and he's running out of time. Lehane's writing is so good, the reader falls completely under his spell.  Many will be utterly shocked by the ending.  The Publisher's Weekly review of the book said it all: \\"it is one of the most aesthetically right resolutions ever written.\\"
B000RG1FMO|5.0|It was new just as the seller said it would be and it got to me in time.
0143038419|5.0|Books that help transform me to be a better human being are not usually on the best seller's list but Elizabeth Gilbert writes in such a delightful way and uses words and phrases that made me think.  She spoke with honesty which was often shocking, but showed 'guts'.  Often was a laugh-out-loud book with much humor along with Wisdom.  She is a real free spirit which will cause you to sin - the sin of envy, jealousy and the list goes on.    Highly recommended - not only for women. I will be watching for next book.
0441172717|5.0|Nothing overrated about the most perfectly realized universe in science fiction. To paraphrase the great Arthur Clarke, \\"nothing compares to it except THE LORD OF THE RINGS.\\" While the series eventually peters out toward the end of the six book cycle, the first three are masterpieces and the original is a classic. Where else will you find a great feminist religious conspiracy, giant \\"sandworms\\" or fanatical desert tribal warriors? And then there are the heroes (Atreides), the villains (Harkonnen scum) and a vast dramatis personae that no novel (SF or otherwise) can match (save, of course, LOTR). Why settle for later and lesser ripoffs? Want to know where George Lucas got \\"Tatooine?\\" And learn how religious dogma and messianism can raise up and then throw down a great desert people. Did I mention there are GIANT SANDWORMS -?? If you only read one SF novel, read this one. If you want to become a fanatical follower of a fictional universe and can't stand elves, this is the book for you! Highest possible recommendation.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|You shouldn't need anyone to tell you that this series is amazing.  Devoid of any political remarks regarding global warming or anything like that, this series is completely focused on nature.  And it does the most beautiful job of showing it off that I've ever seen.    I like the BBC version better because of Attenborough.  His voice is a lot more fitting, I think, than Sigourney Weaver's.

B00025ETIW|4.0|The second (and breakthrough) CD from My Chemical Romance advances the cause for all comic-book geeks with guitars. Rich in exaggerated imagery and dense, sludgy sound, Gerard Way and the guys created a tableau of music that was both loud/fast rock and slickly catchy. There were many who tried to pigeon-hole the band, but there was just no way. For every Goth image like \\"The Ghost of You,\\" there was a pop-song counterpunch like \\"I'm Not Okay\\" or \\"Helena.\\"<br /><br />This is a band that had obviously spent far too much time with their noses buried in comic books, movie theaters and ears glued to classic rock stations. Pink Floyd and Queen collide with Green Day and Radiohead. Lead guitars burn bright as the melodies cruise across the top...and the band barely lets up on the gas through \\"Three Cheers'\\" 13 tracks. The cinematic lyrics (\\"In the middle of a gunfight, in the center of a restaurant\\" opens \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\") often explode out from the frantic songs in a manner that makes them stick even though they rip past you at hyperspeed.<br /><br />\\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" was the sound of a band getting better really fast. Gerard Way conquered addictions after this record and tightened his creative grip even more by the time [[ASIN:B000I5Y8ZU The Black Parade]] was ready to be created. That album has the nuance this lacked and is the better CD because of it, but \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" is still one of the decade's better coming of age albums.

B00005JCAA|3.0|As with most movies starring Brad Pitt, if you put enough real talent around him, the movie can be worth watching.  As always - Pitt is very stiff - he usually comes across sounding like a high school student trying to read Shakespeare.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is brilliant.  Aside from doing the lions share of Pitt-carrying, he makes you feel the urgency of a man who knows he is facing with his final days.<br /><br />This is the first movie I have seen with Claire Forlani - a wonderful talent with a face that will make your heart skip a beat.<br /><br />Just how does a being that has been around since time began not know what peanut butter tastes like this ????

0525950079|2.0|This is not much more than a 14th century soap opera with contemporary dialogue, cardboard characters, and enough juvenile sex to keep a classroom of 8th-grade boys titillated for a week.    Perhaps most disappointing is Follet's character development.  The cast kicks off with promise, and with 1,000 pages to go, you'd think they might have room to grow.  Um, no.  Caris, Merthin, Godwyn and Ralph all become more predictable and less interesting with every turn of the page; by the end of the book there's not a single one you believe or would like to know.  Like the black plague that that serves as a backdrop for much of the book, the characters are merely here to keep the plot moving forward.    Reading \\"World Without End\\" is like sitting down with a bag of cheese puffs.  Before you know it, they're gone - and you're left staring at orange fingers and wondering what the hell you just did.
0671449028|5.0|I bought this item well before my son started appreciating books. And now that his love for books increase, he understands that he can pick own books to read before bed, this has been one of the most consistent one he picked.   Always the last one before we turned of the bed.   The word phrasing is great and catchy enough for a toddler to pick up and repeat.
0800141660|5.0|You know how the Brits keep churning out these adaptations? Every few years you see yet another Austen film from Masterpiece Theater or the BBC or some studio, with yet another updating of an Austen novel.<br />Well, I'm announcing it formally right here and now: no more versions of Sense and Sensibility will be needed, because this one can't be exceeded.<br /><br />This is a truly towering achievement by director Ang Lee and screenwriter/actor Emma Thompson.<br /><br />The story is fabulous, the cast is superb, the settings and costumes are incredible, but here's the thing: this movie, with it's gorgeous lighting and photography, is simply the most visually beautiful film I've ever seen. You will be stunned when you see the sweeping expanses of the English countryside, the magnificent gardens and walled estates, all lit so carefully and exactingly. The HD version of this film may very well induce multiple screaming orgasms among cinephiles, it will be so spectacular.<br /><br />A career-defining role for Hugh Grant, who has the self-effacing, sensitive and lovable fumbling schtick down perfectly. Emma is one incredible actress, certainly one of the greatest performers alive today. Alan Rickman is incapable of delivering an uninteresting take on anything he's in, and finally, the luminous Kate, the English Rose, with her flawless, dew-dropped peaches and cream complexion, is Sense personified.<br /><br />If you don't own this movie, you are losing out big-time. If you don't like English period romances, you have no taste.<br /><br />Period.
0783219695|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie - even though I know how it will end, I am caught up in the adventure, the terror, the heroism, and the space science.  The actors are excellent, especially Ed Harris as the Chief of Mission Control.      The 2-disc DVD has a tremendous amount of background material from the actors, the director, and the real people who were involved in the Apollo 13 mission and rescue.  The special DVD extras are as interesting as the movie - actually, more interesting, if that's possible.    I think this set would make an excellent gift for a school age student (elementary through high school) who's really into science - it's a science movie, an adventure, and a true story all rolled into one.  With lots of great interviews!  Well worth buying.
B000FJGWBC|3.0|The movie was decent.  It wasnt bad, it wasn't awesome.  More than anything; I did actually enjoy the movie (somewhat).  Paul walker did well enough, and Jessica Alba as well.  The cinematography and locale is beautiful.  What didn't work for me was the chemistry between the two lead's.  Sure they look great, but their chemistry just wasnt' there.  Throughout the movie, there's not much character development between the two, which is sad, considering they're the main characters.  Though pleasing to the eye, they spent a little too much on the eye candy, and not enough on the content.  The movie is decent, and watchable, but definitely nothing you'd write home about.  I honestly believe the story with this current cast could have been done much better if it were put into the hands of a better director.  3/5 stars from me.
B000X418UE|5.0|More than likely, you already know whether you like this movie or not. The   question you may be asking is \\"If I own the DVD, is it worth upgrading to   the BD version?\\" I'm happy to report that this is a great transfer, and is   a major upgrade from the DVD version, assuming that you have a audio/video   system that can allow you to see and hear the difference. The picture is   far more detailed than the DVD version, and the uncompressed PCM audio   track is fantastic. Kudos to Disney for doing an excellent job on this one.  Highly recommended.

B000VWYJ86|4.0|The latest in the Jason Bourne saga, `The Bourne Ultimatum' '07 provides a satisfying conclusion (maybe?) to this high octane film trilogy.

B000R4SMCW|5.0|This movie is a great psychological thriller. You can't beat Anthony Hopkins performance and Ryan Gosling does a terrific job as an ambitious attorney. What I liked best about this movie is it's unpredictablity and twists around every corner. I won't give away the ending, but it made the movie totally worth the time watching it -- a WELL DONE film!  If you like psychological thrillers, Anthony Hopkins, crime dramas with hints or sarcasm, wit, and surprises, you'll love Fracture.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|This is one of Smith's captivating acting. One scene is especially fond when a subway platform and an imaginary \\"timing-machine\\" generate a positive outlook to allay their predicament. This movie highlights on a man's assertive mind challenging the flux of his life. It is an adventurous encouraging movie---a pursuit, a process--in a reasonable pace, you don't find it sad at all.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|When I first jumped on the DVD bandwagon back in 99, one of the first films I bought was Titanic...given said edition's only \\"special feature\\" was a theatrical trailer, I was naturally disappointed, but still wanted it just for the sake of \\"upgrading\\" my VHS copy.<br /><br />So, was it worth waiting 6 years for this 3-disc collector's edition? You bet it was...tons of extras, including:<br /><br />- 45 min. of deleted scenes (including an alternate ending!)<br />- A photo gallery w/hundreds of pics<br />- A mock c. 1912 \\"newsreel\\"<br />- The aforementioned theatrical trailer<br /><br />If you loved this (as they say on TNT) \\"new classic\\", it's a must-have for your DVD library...incidentally, the just-released \\"10th Anniversary Edition\\" is basically the same set repackaged, so you can apply this review to it as well (although one wonders why James Cameron and Paramount didn't see the need to add some extras that weren't in this release).
B000Y179KO|4.0|I'm not going to get too involved with this review. It is great to hear new music from the Eagles again.  The song \\"How Long\\" is vintage Eagles from their early days.  That's because it was written way back in the early 70's.  I enjoy listening to the entire album and so will you.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|a nice conclusion the the Bourne Series. could have used a little more imagination on the ending.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|The introductions to the characters were overly long, and didn't really make me care about them.  Plus it's really difficult to write a story around existing material and make it work... and these people didn't.  It's also overwrought in many places - and while some sequences like \\"A Little Help From My Friends\\" and \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" work, others (particularly \\"I Am The Walrus\\" and \\"For The Benefit of Mr. Kit\\") are horribly... well... laughable.  Eddie Izzard is particularly terrible and improvises dialogue (or delivers lines from a really bad screenplay, I'm not sure which) during the song, and it didn't work.
B000ROALCG|5.0|El Cantante is the BEST Latin CD EVER!! Incredible dance music and 2 lovely slow songs sung by Marc. I play this CD at the gym every day and it makes me just want to continue working out. You will NOT be disappointed ....I bought 6 of these cd's as Christmas gifts and my friends couldn't thank me enough. It's great....
B000E41MS6|5.0|I bought this for my husband on Christmas. He can't stop watching this set. Im gonna have to buy him the whole collection..It was a great choice
B0007GAEGC|5.0|One of my favorite CD's.  Most of what passes for music these days falls so short that I sometimes wish I was deaf so I wouldn't be subjected to ubiquitous ambient \\"music\\" (eg. Bruce Springsteen piped overhead into restaurant bathroom stalls.  Love you, Bruce... but, pick a better venue, please).  Anyway, the clear beauty of the Celtic Woman voices is transportive and inspiring; it is music that matches my heartbeat, breathing, and sends my own creative spirit soaring.  (I'm an illustrator.)
B000TXG3YA|5.0|This album has been in constant rotation for the best part of three months now.  Just having learned guitar, I have found many a choice riffs in the beautifully patterned song structures.  (See Song #1, about 5:00 in).  Best album of the year.
0060594896|5.0|This is a basic book on success but done very well.  I found it motivational and inspiring.
B000B5XOXY|1.0|Joel Schumacher could have gone on to cure cancer, bring peace to the Middle East, and end world hunger. I would STILL hate him for this turgid hackwork. This gets a two-disc special edition? What kind of masochist would order that?
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Another fabulous performance. These Ladies put on a performance that is just wonderful.  The music is just spell binding.
B000W04S6U|5.0|If you enjoy clean orchestra sound, this CD is creative and at the same time enjoyable.  My son loves it and is something the entire family can listen with out getting tire...
B00004Y6NP|5.0|I've only recently become a convert to more classic rock type stuff, and Brothers in Arms is the 2nd album I purchased from Dire Straits so far.  I don't think it's quite as good as Sultans of Swing (Which I listen to a lot), but this is still extremely good.    Brother's in Arms is definitely a song for anyone who has been in the military.  The reason why I say this is because the lyrics is more tuned into what military people feel in times of war.  This is the one song that got my father extremely interested in Dire Straits as well.  Brother's in Arms brings tears to his eyes every time he listens to the song - it's that emotionally moving for him.  I really recommend this CD to anyone, but especially those in the military.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011UBDTK Sex and the City: The Complete Series]]    Might I say that when I read all these bad reviews I was a bit hesitant to buy it. In the end I wanted it so bad I was determine to fight the odds. I got it about two weeks ago and have watch every single episode to make sure they all were working. I am very happy with this series the box is super cute. It sits right next to my husbands Sopranos DVDs. When I got it i first made sure nothing was broken everything was in mint condition. Nothing broken or scratched. I love it. I have no complaints what so ever. I say to all the ladies and gentlemen who want this series buy it. It is so worth it.
B00000DGUY|5.0|I just recently got into listening to Dire Straits, and have grown extremely fond of this group's ability to perform music.  This particular CD I especially like (I also have Brother in Arms).  One of my favorite songs on this CD is the song \\"Sultans of Swing\\", which I spent last night listening to.  It's not exactly a complicated song, 3 guitars, drums, vocal that I could hear.  The melody, though, is really good - better than most anything else I heard from Eagles or Led Zeppelin.      I highly recommend this CD if you're either a Dire Straits fan, or just a newbie like myself.  This CD is a good groundwork to really get into their music more (I'm in the process of buying all the CDs from them I can find).
B000K15VSA|5.0|This box set is pure ambrosia for the Bladerunner fanatic. Disc 1, the restored/remastered \\"Final Cut\\" is just the start of the goodness! The extras discs have all kinds of goodies for those who dig deep enough. The screen tests for the roles of Pris and Rachel are great, showing several different actors that tried for the roles, as well as Sean Young and Daryl Hannah's tests. Also of interest are the many outtakes and deleted scenes. There is almost enough footage to make a completely different version of the movie! One particularly good scene is Harrison Ford and Sean Young's lovemaking  session toward the end of the movie -- much \\"hotter\\" than the one that made it to the final cut. All I can say is ... WOW.<br /><br />Current-day interviews with cast members were great, as well as the \\"Making of Bladerunner\\" mini-documentary that really gives you a taste of the Hollywood insanity that is involved in movie making. It's amazing this movie was ever made considering all the crap the director had to go through in dealing with producers and other meddlers.<br /><br />Anyway -- if you're a fantatic, you won't be disappointed.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|As other reviewers have indicated, the colorized version in this set is definitely next generation, noticeably superior to--in particular--the Ted Turner-backed colorized versions of various movies (circa late 1980s/early 1990s).  You don't get the sense that you're watching a colorized version.  If you're expecting Technicolor-like brilliance, you may be disappointed.  My expectations were conservative;  the DVD exceeded those expectations.  Haven't scrutinized the B&W version yet.
0439882826|5.0|Great fun and very well done.  I gave this as a gift, but found the book very cool!
0307387151|2.0|I was expecting this to be an exciting, interesting book and I stalled at 3/4's of the way through because it still hadn't gotten any momemtum or reached the conflict stage.  I will probably finish it, but only when I have nothing else to read.
B000Q6GUT8|5.0|The product was delivered in a timely manner as it was a gift for Christmas and came when promised.
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my son who apparently has seen it & wanted it for his collection. It arrived promptly & in excellent condition. TX
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This product was delivered in a timely manner and was a Christmas gift and delivered when promised.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|This album is ultimately satisfying.  Every time I listen to, \\"In Rainbows,\\" I imagine myself relaxing on a gorgious beach watching the sun set into the neon glow of the horizon.  The songs on this record feel so uplifting.  Compared to other Radiohead albums I actually prefer THIS one.  I honestly never expected to say it, but the group has actually succeeded in recreating themselves again... and the change is delightful.  The songs are very memorable, but non-invasive at the same time... they have tiny hooks either in the music or in the vocals but they're subtle enough that they add to the songs instead of destroying them.  The music itself is intoxicatingly beautiful.  All in all I believe it to be one of the most powerful records in Radiohead's catalogue.  Though I've enjoyed every single Radiohead release, I'm in love with this one.  It's not daunting, or moody... it's simply gorgeous.  I highly recommend it for those who enjoy relaxing, soothing, and uplifting music.
B00099BRUO|3.0|If you can listen to, like, or think of any possible reason for doing a version of An American Trilogy you have passed Manowar's mighty test of sensibilities.    I'm afraid that I must report that I failed this test.     Check and mate --- victory goes to Manowar.
B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|Similar to Philip K. Dick's writing.  He comes up with some truly fascinating and philosophically challenging scenarios, usually in a \\"science fiction-ish\\"/futuristic kind of setting.  This movie takes the idea of seeing into the future--cleverly just two minutes--and does too little with it.  Or too much.  That's where I get confused.  The idea of Frank Cadillac seeing just two minutes into the future is inherently fascinating, since the unlimited foresight idea has been done before.  The writers tried to make the story too complicated, though, leaving it unfinished and/or incomplete.    Some of my quick hits:    -- Julianne Moore's considerable talent is largely wasted, and her character could have been played well by other actresses.  Her dialogue and intentions are way too melodramatic, which just complicates things for the worse.    -- The terrorist angle just seems too \\"complicated,\\" especially with the whole idea not being explained well in the first place.  It could have been a nice drama and/or a nice romantic movie; it also might have been a good terrorist/action kind of movie; but it didn't work as both (or all three).    -- Some of the dialogue was just horribly clunky in spots, typical of Dick's writing.  Very distracting for me.    -- The special effects were in and out, fascinating at times, switching in and out of now/then.  Other times it looked like something I would film in my back yard:  the truck falling down the hill. . . .    -- Unlike some, I was OK with the ending, even though it may have borrowed from other movies.  What movie doesn't. . . ?    -- Great Line:     \\"They killed her.  Two hours from now.\\"  (As an English teacher, I love the playing around with verb tenses.)     Overall I guess I enjoyed it, but more out of loyalty to Philip K. Dick than to the quality of the movie.  It wasn't horrible, but it just didn't work great for me.  Make up your mind:  a \\"24\\"/Jack Bauer-ish anti-terrorist action movie OR a Matrix-ish special effects-fest OR a romantic-ish kind of movie with a twist of foresight OR a simple drama with Cadillac's gift of foresight contributing to a crime hunt or his own personal quest for a good life.  Too much switching from genre to genre within a movie becomes distracting, leaving each segment unfulfilled.  Definitely worth a watch for those who have followed Philip K. Dick novels and stories find their way to movie screens.  Not even close to BLADE RUNNER or MINORITY REPORT, not as bad as A SCANNER DARKLY.
0142000655|5.0|If you do not have much time over the next couple days, DON'T read this book.  Not only will it eat away your life, but also you will be distracted by whatever you need to do.  Rather, wait until you have a nice week or so to spare.  The book's masterful and entrancing writing had me awake in the wee hours of morning, unwilling to stop reading the story's beautiful progression.    Successfully paralleling the novels' tale of two families to the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, John Steinbeck intertwines the aspects of the allusion to reflect the actions of the pairs of brothers in the story.  Furthermore, he even corresponds the first letter of the brothers' name to be C(ain) and A(bel), with C jealous of A.      Each character is imbued with a collage of complexity and struggles.  Adam Trask is overly trusting and inability to see people as they really are while his brother Charles Trask fails to attract the approval their father.  Adam's twin sons, the next set of boys, subsequently have their troubles too.  Aron suffers with moral sensibility, whereas Cal strains like Charles to find the acceptance of his father.  Complementing these composite brothers are Cathy, Adam's malicious, yet pretty wife, Lee, the helpful Chinese assistant, and Samuel Hamilton, Adam's poor unfortunate, but kind neighbor in the Salinas Valley who aids him throughout the novel.      Steinbeck's style is plainly awesome.  The captivating style entices all.  Its eloquence mimics the Biblical allusion wonderfully. The contrasting characters bring layers of intricacy to the story.   Each is supplemented by the question of an innate destiny and how much they truly are affected by it.    In conclusion, for your life to be complete, you must have read this book.  The book is essentially the epitome of literature, the apex of novels, the zenith of stories.  If you have some spare change, go out and add this masterpiece to your collection.  It definitely is worth every half-a-penny.
B000WGN3YM|5.0|Having seen them twice, once just after the release of _Tuesday Wonderland_, I can say that they are an amazing display of technique meeting creativity meeting passion.  Nice mix. . . .  Most of this material is from that CD, with a couple of nice tracks from previous efforts.  A couple of \\"fan favorites\\" add a very nice touch, separating this from just being live performances from their latest CD.  That, in and of itself, would be great, but more is always better.  A majority of the tracks run well over ten minutes, which is what they do in concert.  They take their basic outline/melody/hook, then go from there.  Where they go in the intervening minutes is anybody's guess, but the journey is always fun.  The solo skills of all three musicians are impressive, particularly live.  They each have multiple moments in the spotlight, and their interplay is striking.  One bass solo by Berglund, in particular, blew me away in this set.  I hate to compare their improving skills (or whatever it is) to other groups, since I'm no expert, but I do know what I like.  They are the second (at worst) group to whom I like to listen, particularly because of the all-for-one nature of the three.  The Keith Jarrett Trio is still out in front, at least for me.  The years they have spent together, 10+, really manifest themselves.  Bottom Line:  This group is impressive and deserves a wider audience than they may have.  If you are visiting this site by intent, then you are already a fan:  enjoy.  If you are here by accident, please take a listen and enjoy the ride.
0321213351|5.0|Clean up (refactoring) is fun. Clean up to the design level (patterns) is stunning. A very pragmatic introduction, down to the code and incredibly helpful. Even strong procrastinators develop an appetite for this often little loved part of our work.    Now what are the prerequisites: You should have read and maybe even handy the landmark book \\"Refactoring\\" by Martin Fowler and colleagues. You need a working knowledge of design patterns. You have to actually like real code. Everything else is contained in this beautiful book.    The writing style is lucid and the topic is explained in a refactoring fashion: Readers are guided through the subject with real code (somewhat simplified) in small steps at a slow speed step by step. It is amazing how much ground you cover this way and how fast.    I do highly recommend this book for every software developer.
B000X3VN46|5.0|Since Tarja was fired by Nightwish, I've been anxiously (and apprehensively) awaiting both this record and Nightwish's recent release.  I must say that while Nightwish's \\"Dark Passion Play\\" was outstanding, I like Tarja's CD just a bit more.  The sound is big, dramatic symphonic rock, and as one would expect, the songs and arrangements provide Tarja's vocals the opportunity to really shine.      By way of indication to others, I'm a big fan of Within Temptation, Evanescence, Epica, and Lacuna Coil.  If none of them ring a bell, imagine Sarah Maclachlan fronting for Led Zeppelin, with Tchaikovsky or Beethoven contributing symphonic elements.  Also, I typically check out online music videos before buying anything new, you can see a video of the title track on Tarja's web site.    As a final note, I didn't find this particularly vindictive, at least not in comparison to \\"Bye Bye Beautiful\\" on Dark Passion Play.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I thought that the first series was great, but this one packs an unexpected punch and reels you in right to the dying minutes of the last episode. Well done to great writting and to an exceptional cast.    The dvds are in great condition. Were delivered quickly. I am very excited to be adding this fabulous tv series to my collection. Thanks for the great service.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|I was reluctant to buy the box-set due to how Lost was aired.  Please allow me to explain a few topics though, this review is a positive one; however there needs to be a clarification toward Box-Sets and telecasts these days.  My wife and I never watch TV, as a matter of fact, when we do hear of a really good show that's televised, we always reply, \\"We'll wait for the box-set.\\"  Understand that it was the marketing surrounding Lost that ruined the experience; along with episodes recounting old scenes & happenings to bring the viewer up to date.  I understand that the producers want the viewer to be `in the loop' with everything, but for all of us Lost fans - it got old and quick.  My wife and I stopped watching Lost on TV and wait for the seasons to come out on DVD/Box-Set due to all the commercials & re-cap episodes; we feel it's insulting and completely ruins the experience.  I'm happy to announce that by default when viewing the 3rd Season of Lost, no re-cap episodes bog down the viewing.  And of course, a sigh of relief every time an obvious cut-scene continues into the next scene without a commercial is a welcome experience.  Without doubt, watching Lost via box-set will devour all viewers, I can only keep my fingers crossed that the future box-sets will be as pleasurable as this one.
1591396190|4.0|This book provides 'out of the box' thinking for any executives struggling with competition and being perceived as a 'commodity' in their marketplace. Innovating your value and differentiating yourself to the portion of the market that the masses of competitors are not servicing is one path to success. The examples of Cirque du Soleil, Yellow Tail Wines and NetJets shows how creative strategy can move you out of the 'Red Ocean' (competitive blood bath) and into the 'Blue Ocean' (new market realm) to ultimately make the competition irrelevant.    I highly recommend this book to my clients that feel like they are stuck in a 'commodity play'. Value Innovate. Don't be a commodity!    Kevin A.

B000A59PMO|5.0|It was brilliant it didn't really take all that long to come through and I already watched it so I can certainly say that it's in excellent condition the packaging was also good it was tightly wrapped so it couldn't slide about as well.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|People actually like this ridiculous, sorry version of P&P?? Some people actually call this an accurate adaptation??     Huh.    But then again, that's why the work of Britney Spears is called music, and the likes of Paris Hilton are seen as icons, right? And scores of females actually want to be them....    Trash. Pathetic lack of knowledge and lack of good sense rule the globe today. Thank you, the trash generator that is Hollywood.
B00003CXC7|2.0|...But hardly a masterpiece.  For that, try Torn Curtain (1966), or Hitch's last and best, Family Plot (1976).    Poor production values, including a set that does the film no favors, leave this one-trick pony limping badly out of the gate.  Grace Kelly is game enough playing the socialite girlfriend of  photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart), but there's no real chemistry between the two leads (had Prince Rainier already proposed?).  Worse yet, the two supporting players (Thelma Ritter as Jeffries' nurse, and Raymond Burr as the defense attorney accused of killing a dog) seem to be phoning it in.    Worst of all, this mystery movie has no real mystery.  Stewart and Kelly suspect Burr has killed a dog--guess what?  He did!  I won't spoil what follows, except to say Burr's actions are beyond belief, given that he (at most) faced no more than a fine for cruelty to animals.    The \\"Miss Torso\\" character is the sole bright spot in this gloomy production, but alas, she has far too little screen time.  The two stars are for her.

B00005OCMR|5.0|My oldest son loves Tron. It's one of his very favorite movies. He never found it anywhere else, so I was thrilled to find it here, & I bought 2 copies for Christmas - one for him & one for my husband. Because it's an old movie, it's not \\"high-tech\\", but it's clean, fun, & interesting in its concepts. All the bonus material excited my son! He's 26, so he's not much older than this movie, but it holds great memories for him of seeing it on TV when he was little. Tron is unique.
B000MM1F6E|3.0|I've recently become more interested in the SACD format since purchasing a ps3.  I have a couple Peter Gabriel SACD's -- which sound awesome.  But this particular SACD is a real disappointment because it's only 2 channel.  Yes it's remastered and if you don't mind it being in plain ol' stereo it does sound superior to the regular issue on cd.<br /><br />I was really hoping to listen to this in 5.1 -- it's a great album and I was betting it would sound tremendous in surround.
0060558121|4.0|Gaiman will truly make you rethink godhood and all about what \\"divine\\" is in his book. Even more, the feelings and images he evokes in some of its chapters make you feel as if you have lost something on the way to the modern era only to find it again, transformed, but nonetheless, equally powerful. Gods do change according to Gaiman, but their tricks and their ethos do not. This is a spectacular book which will plunge the reader into a sort of thriller/epic book that will force you to question the current \\"american way\\" of life and the \\"evolution\\" of traditions.<br /><br />However, new readers to Gaiman should be aware that perhaps this is not the most recommendable book to start reading him since it is plagued with references to gods adored in the past and sometimes they are a little difficult to identify amongst the characters of the book, which might actually hinder the reader's understanding of why some characters do what they do. Also, for those who have read Gaiman already, the book is not nearly as good as the potrayal he did about gods in The Sandman series, so you might actually end up being a little dissapointed in the way Odin the All Father is displayed in this book compared to the way he was in the comic.<br /><br />All in all, however, this is a great book. Just not as good as other titles in the Gaiman library.
B000OVLBGC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but it is easier to follow if you have some knowledge of German.  Nevertheless, I generally don't like foreign language films and found this one refreshing.  It is a good reminder of what the cold war was about (on a personal level) and is a cautionary tale about the abuses of absolute power.  The acting is very good as the character's emotions come through even with the language barrier.  Certainly not in my top ten of movies but worth seeing.
0743454529|4.0|I have to give Ms. Picoult kudos for craftily addressing the issue of stem cell research and its consequences in such a creative way.<br />I can certainly understand why some readers may have felt betrayed by the ending in this very engaging story. I, too, got emotionally attached to the characters, including the one everyone was rooting for, Anna. But in Ms. Picoult's defense, for whatever her reasons were for changing the ending, she certainly had creative license to do so. Sometimes writers have to take risks that sets them apart from the average by thinking outside the box. I, personally, wasn't pleased with the ending, but it proved to be a very engaging read all the way through-- even if it was painful to read the last chapter.<br />JAX, author of [[ASIN:0955440971 Heart of The Jaguar]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Y353X2 A Shadow to Call Her Own]] Amazon shorts<br />\\"A Bridge to Freedom\\" and \\"Grandma's Recipe\\" [[ASIN:0757303110 Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul: Celebrating La Comunidad Latina]][[ASIN:1598209671 Sopa de pollo para el alma latina/ Chicken Soup for the Latino Soul (Sopa De Pollo)]]<br />[...]

B00005T7I1|5.0|I had to revisit this movie almost 20 years later   to really grasp the film makers vision of this old   comic book classic!--Warren Beatty, Al Pacino,   Dustin Hoffman and the other cast members all pull off   stellar depictions of the classic arch-villians that generations   from the late 30's to the 60's grew up on!   The real catalyst that brought all of this together   though was the excellent make-up, costuming and cinematography!  --Just stellar!!--Even Madonna did a good job as \\"Breathless Mohoney\\"  --Her and Beatty were hot and heavy during this time  and she was in the midst of her \\"Blonde Ambition   / Truth Or Dare\\" period!!--Can U Say Femme Fatale?  If you get into comic characters brought to life in   a believable fashion, then this is great for your collection!
0307387151|4.0|Having read reviews of the movie, I decided to read the novel first. I'm glad I did, although knowing there was a surprise ending gave a good portion of the surprise away fairly early in the book. I would definitely recommend reading the book prior to seeing the film.  McEwan keeps your interest riveted throughout the shifts in time and place that occur in the novel with strongly etched characters, and deep philosophical ruminations. It's a rewarding literary journey, but I have to admit feeling sad, and empty at the end..intellectually enlightened, but emotionally drained.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is possibly the most intriquing show to hit television in a long, long time. Like The Sopranos, the show is carried by the charisma and charm of its \\"bad\\" guy protagonist. True, Tony is no serial killer (depending on your definition), but he too kills when pragmatism deems it necessary. Yet though Tony is a murderer, as are his associates, the viewer often finds it hard not to root for them to stay alive, which provides for an intriguing moral dilemma: is there such thing as bad, violent actions that could be deemed good? If one of Tony's gang kills an innocent woman, and thus he kills them, is it a good act?     The same thing goes for Dexter, who is a serial killer. He, like Tony, must kill at times (for different reasons, obviously). And he, like Tony, has a code to live by. Overall Tony is decent to most people, but cross him and watch out. Dexter is liked by most people (even though he doesn't care about them in any way), and he also lives by a code, which only allows him to kill the worst of the worst. He doesn't kill innocent people, and never children.     This is where the moral dilemma comes in. Multiple times while watching Dexter I found myself rooting for him. When the cops were on to him, I was hoping fervently that he'd get away to kill another day.     That's the brilliance of this show, not to mention the amazing performance of Michael C. Hall from Six Feet Under fame.     For anyone with a dark sense of humor, this is the show for you. Don't miss out on the best new show to hit television since Deadwood.

How can you describe this film?<br />I have watched this now all the way through(in past just 15 min<br />here and there...No way to watch NO.2) The cinematography is one<br />of the best in films I have seen.  Also sound was enormously<br />loud,fantastic and HORRIFYING;}  I am glad I have this movie in my<br />catalog now but QUESTION???  Where do I place this???  Comedy?<br />Drama? Is this movie like El Topo or is it just another Andy<br />Warhol SLEEP.  I decided to put this in my HORROR coll.(Oh! Big<br />surprise their Clint) I classify this as Bizarre Horror and<br />know I need to see this a few more times to really appreciate<br />it.  I'm one who is big on story and straightforwardness but<br />in 2008 I am going to open my mind more to these classics.<br />It always pleases me to see a fine Director do a movie in a HORROR<br />genre.  Directors who do not specialize in SPOOK flicks but make<br />one have really given us GEMS.

B000X418UE|5.0|I loved this movie since it came out.  We ordered the Blu-Ray version and it was like watching crystal.  It was so sharp.  Out of the 30+ discs I own, Cars and the Rock are the best in picture so far.  I hope they do the same for Armageddon when it comes out.
0812975219|1.0|This book was a true disappointment.  The one coherent point of the book can be summed up by the title.  The contention that traders (and others) tend to ignore rare (and random) events is a good one.  But, through the first 114 pages (I got no further, and, as Taleb would tell you, that is absolutely no indication that the rest of the book is not pure Shakespeare), there are no other points besides 1) Taleb is very very smart and 2) everyone else is an idiot.  Taleb never considers that he himself might be the product of a rare event: a mindless trader who did well by betting big on an unlikely outcome.      It's especially annoying to me (as a statistician) that he asks questions like (on p. 112): \\"Why dont Statisticians Detect Rare Events.\\"  Actually, we do.  As his own logic would tell you, just because some people versed in statistics (or Economics) lost big in bets like Long Term Capital, does not indicate that the whole field of statistics is missing something that Taleb can provide.    I kept reading hoping that through all the arrogance and pettiness, there would be some interesting points or at least anecdotes.  I'm sorry to say there weren't, and while I will allow for the possibility that the Philospoher's stone is buried in the last pages of the book, I refuse to read them anyway--it's not worth the pain.
B000654YRY|5.0|We have enjoyed Dire Straits concert \\"ON The Night\\" since 1994, on laser disc.  (Alchemey since '95).  Laser discs might have been a failed experiment, but the concerts were wonderful to watch.  A big screen tv, some good speakers, and everyone who saw them were wowed.  We bought the dvd to share with others.  This is our favorite show.  The mix of high energy songs with the mellower ballads is perfect. And Mark Knopfler is a thrill to watch.  Enjoy!
0887306101|4.0|Market Wizards does not attempt to convey an overall market or trading philosophy.  Instead, Schwager goes trader by trader and interviews them on their philosophies.  He writes in an objective fashion, and leaving it to the reader to decide which tradres got where they did by luck and circumstance and which by skill and smarts.    The background of each interviewee, which Schwager gives at the start of each chapter, is sometimes fascinating.  It's also interesting to compare traders with diametrically opposed philosphies, each firmly entrenched.    Overall, very good.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Websites that track positive and negative reviews from the major critics register a positive score of at least 95% for Ratatouille, clearly putting it at the top of the films of 2007.  Is it the best film of the year?  No, but it's the one with the greatest appeal, as nearly everyone will consider viewing it to be a positive experience.    Ratatouille follows Remy, a curious rat who aspires to be more than a garbage thief.  Remy's acute sense of smell and appreciation for food attract him to the culinary arts.   By stealing what he can from a elderly homeowners appreciation for cooking shows and books, Remy becomes a devotee of one of France's most famous chefs, Auguste Gusteau'.  After Remy learns that Gusteau died years and he had been watching reruns of his television program, the little rat begins to be guided Ben Kenobi-like by the spirit of the dead chef.      Following the spirit eventually leads him to Gusteau's former restaurant, which has been taken over by a artless capitalist who uses Gusteau's image to sell frozen burritos and corndogs.  By using a young kitchen worker as a medium, Remy tries to rebuild the reputation of Gusteau and return his restaurant to its glory.    The resulting action is an often charming tale of a rat as much devoted to finding himself as achieving his goal.  Lots of laughs are found when his family shows up looking for handouts, and the chief antagonists (the owner and a food critic) create real dramatic moments of peril.    Remy is truly a film \\"hero\\", someone devoted to a cause that he believes will make the world a better place.    Although lacking the heart of the Toy Story films or the comic brilliance of the first Shrek, Ratatouille continues the trend of the animation renaissance that has provided some of the best films of the last decade.
0143038419|3.0|Following the journey of Elizabeth Gilbert as she dealt with her reconciliation in dealing with the termination of her marriage took us on two simultaneous trips. One involved spiritual study and enlightenment and the other was a year long adventure in Italy, India, and Indonesia.     Some might see an ongoing conflict between self-indulgence and spiritual sacrifice, while others might sense the harmony uniting the two trips. This book resulted in the bringing together of the two pilgrimages.    After all is said and done, this is a good read. It is a book of emotions. It is both funny and heart wrenching.
0767805712|4.0|\\"Gattaca\\"  is an example of the essence of science fiction.  Science fiction is about science and technology and how it's advances can affect our lives.  What if genetic mapping progresses to the point where a single drop of blood can tell someone your strengths and weaknesses.  Your genome is used to identify you, define your future and establish your place in society.    Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was conceived in love by his parents.  He grows up wanting to be an astronaut.  But he won't be given the opportunity.  In his world, most children are optimized by geneticists at conception.  They are the best possible child their parents can have.  But Vincent is made the old- fashioned way.  Before he leaves the delivery room it is determined he has poor vision, a bad heart and a 99% probability of dying around age 30.    His parents correct their `mistake' and have a second optimized son two years later.  Unable to deal with their pity and frustrated in his ambition, he runs away.    He finds out there is a man (Tony Shaloub) who helps people like him.   In return for a deposit and a percentage of his income.  He takes the identity of Jerome (Jude Law), a foreign national of super intelligence and physical capabilities.  But Jerome is crippled.      This two form an unlikely team.  `Jerome' becomes `Eugene'.  Eugene keeps Jerome/Vincent supplied with urine and blood samples.  The new Jerome has spent years home schooling himself.  He interviews at the private space firm Gattaca and is immediately hired as a navigator.    The two continue their elaborate ruse for five years.  Jerome performs flawlessly and is chosen for an important space mission.  Unfortunately his life is complicated by two things, his new love (Uma Thurman) and a murder at Gattaca.  Either factor can expose him on the eve of his success.    `Gattaca' is about the significance of the human will and faith.  Anton/Jerome has been told he will never be anything.  Yet he finds a way to achieve the dream he has been unfairly denied.      The film tells this story with a great script and superior performances with few special effects.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I'm sorry to say I found this version profoundly disappointing.  \\"Persuasion\\" is my favorite Austen novel, and I sat down to watch it with high hopes.  Fortunately we have the rich, subtle Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds version the BBC made in 1995 to turn to.  Not only is it more faithful to the novel, it is also a smoother story, less choppy and abrupt.      I had a number of objections, but my chief one was the alteration to the character of Anne Elliot.  She is supposed to be a woman of quiet moral strength whose family dismisses her as a nonentity.  She courageously makes the best of a life that has disappointed her ever since she was persuaded to give up marrying the man of her choice years earlier.  This version portrayed her as a poor, pathetic, meek creature who hides away in a corner and weeps whenever anyone hurts her feelings.  My secondary objection was the kissing and wild running around the street.  No respectable woman of the period would EVER have behaved that way in public.  Who decided to do this?  It almost seemed to be the work of someone who thought Austen's restraint was too tame for 21st century tastes, but since it is bizarrely popular, let's re-write it with more modern behavior.
B000QUCNP4|3.0|This is a fairly good film, full of brooding and stalking. However my enthusiasm for the film was tempered a little by the cliché of its central theme - which is the obsession that one police detective develops with the case.    The worst part of the cliché is the way the detective's wife is relegated to the shadows while he pursues his obsession. Actually, women play virtually no role in this film at all, except as victims. The whole film is the importance of men's concentrations. The detective's wife really has only one notable line in the movie, and that's to fadingly worry whether the carrots or some other dishes she's prepared for dinner - are warm enough. Eventually, as always happens in these cases, the marriage dissolves altogether and the detective is left to ponder the evidence in a state of increasing isolation and disintegration.     How refreshing it would be to just once see a spouse plunge into an investigation with equal interest, the way Daphne does on an episode of \\"Frasier,\\" the TV sitcom. When health care provider Daphne sees Martin, the retired policeman, pouring over some old photos of a cold case murdered prostitute, she doesn't cringe, whine, and worry. She commands, \\"Here, don't be a greedy guts! Let me have a look!\\"     Of course, the Zodiac murders were no joke. But the spectacle of yet one more detective degenerating into the puzzle detracts from the unique seriousness of the case. There are also some splotches of illogic that detract from the film. For example, at one point the vulnerable detective accompanies a supremely creepy suspect down, alone, into an unlit basement. There was no good reason for the detective to expose himself to such danger, other than to establish this movie firmly in the category of \\"thriller.\\"    I was also disappointed that there was no commentary on this DVD version. It would have been interesting to know some more of the facts about the actual investigation, so I suggest you obtain a full Director's copy of this film.    But the film's score largely makes up for any lapses. Its haunting, taunting theme song, \\"Hurdy-Gurdy Man,\\" truly captures the likely psychological state of the serial killer.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I was excited to see a Masterpiece adaptation on PBS. Unfortunately, I found this version dull and dismal. I didn't feel that the film makers adaquately portrayed why these two characters were in love or why he would wait to be married all of these years. In the lovely 1995 version, you see the underlying humor, will, and strength of character in Anne. Frederick and Anne also have exchanges that reveal their passion for one another. While it also takes liberty with some of the original story - I've always wanted to see the drama with her widow friend included more - it is definitely more moving and better developed. I would recommend bypassing this Masterpiece version.
B000K15VSA|5.0|I originally just bought the 2-disc Final Cut and decided that I didn't need all of the extra stuff this box set comes with. That is until I actually saw it at the store and I caved.

0143038419|1.0|this woman is seriously annoying. there are moments of her spiritual journey that ring true, but those moments are no great revelation to any reasonably self-aware person. the prose is flat and repetitive and self-indulgent... and so she. the clamor over this book is truly out of control... !
0375714839|5.0|THE COMPLETE PERSEPOLIS brings together in one softbound volume two graphic novels published earlier in English (translated from French): PERSEPOLIS 1 - THE STORY OF A CHILDHOOD, and PERSEPOLIS 2 - THE STORY OF A RETURN. As a single volume, Ms. Satrapi's work reads as a seamless story of an Iranian woman's maturation from a young girl in the Shah's (and Ayatollah Khomeini's) Iran to her high school years in Austria, back to the Iran attacked by Saddam Hussein and then transformed into a fundamentalist Islamic state, and finally back again to Europe as a young adult. The book's title is borrowed from the name of ancient Persia's ceremonial capital, dating back some 2,500 years, although Persepolis is in fact the Greek translation of the original Persian name, Parsa.<br /><br />The story is strictly autobiographical, rendered as a memoir of childhood and young adulthood. Satrapi begins her story at age ten, the daughter of well-educated and well-off parents who put a premium on their daughter's religious and academic independence. Marjane's parents prod their pre-adolescent daughter toward a liberal education and encourage her to speak out. However, being a rebel against oppression in Iran leads inevitably to trouble and expulsion from school. Her parents recourse is to pack young Marjane off to Austria, isolated and alone in a foreign and far more secular culture. A series of mostly negative experiences leads her back to her homeland and an unsuccessful marriage during the early years of Iran's fundamentalist revolution with its growing religious oppression. When the young adult Marjane and her parents finally realize that her future lies not in Iran but in Europe, she heads off to France where she still lives today.<br /><br />Ms. Satrapi characterizes herself as the perennial outsider wherever she lives. As a young girl, political and religious events contradict her upbringing and isolate her from the accepted beliefs and behaviors. The author conveys her childhooddesperation by repeated depictions of herself talking to an ancient, white-bearded God, even cradled in his arms. She is even more the outsider in Austria, forever fumbling in her discoveries of Western culture only to become enslaved by some of its worst features. Returning to Iran after her high school years, Marjane is too Westernized to be Iranian, yet still too Iranian to feel Western. The author's journey to self-discovery and finding her true home serves as the core of her story, punctuated by her departures and arrivals. In fact, some of the most dramatic scenes in THE COMPLETE PERSEPOLIS take place at airports.<br /><br />Satrapi's black-and-white cartooning emphasizes contrast over detail. Indeed, her drawings of people are exceedingly simplified, lacking in all except the basic features necessary to portray a character. This simplicity works, as it stands in stark contrast to the complexity of Iran's constantly changing social, political, and religious structures as well as the complexity of the author's own life and the choices she faced. These minimalist renderings, hardly more detailed than Schulz's \\"Peanuts\\" characters, create an even greater dissonance when their childlike simplicity clashes with the horrors of war and the Iranian government's seizures and executions of many of its citizens. The reader is so effectively lulled into this seemingly benign, comic book world that Satrapi's occasional dropping of an expletive into her character's thoughts or words has the force of a slap in the face. When young Marjane returns home to see the dead, braceleted arm of one of her neighborhood friends (killed by one of Saddam Hussein's missiles) extending from her wrecked home, the author resorts to the powerful simplicity of a completely black panel captioned, \\"No scream in the world could have relieved my suffering and my anger.\\"<br /><br />There is a natural temptation to compare PERSEPOLIS to Art Spiegelman's MAUS I and MAUS II. However, I believe the Maus books are sui generis, allegorical tales whose use of mice and cats puts Spiegelman's books in a class of their own. By contrast, Satrapi's PERSEPOLIS novels are autobiographical volumes rendered in illustrated form to trace an Iranian woman's struggle to find herself while still loving a country from which she feels irretrievably estranged. Satrapi's and Spiegelman's work complement one another and demonstrate the emotional power graphical novels are increasingly finding ways to achieve.
0743455967|5.0|Part memoir, part writing manual, \\"On Writing\\" is a great book for both readers and aspiring writers. In the first half, King provides a brief autobiography, focussing on the events that led to him becoming a writer and these events are every bit as compelling as the fiction that he writes. From his absent father, to his adventures in the back woods of Maine and his battles with alcohol and cocaine addiction, it is possible to see the inspiration for many of his books and characters (and I can guarantee that after reading this book, you will never so much as consider trying cocaine).    The second half is a how-to manual for writers, in which King explains everything from grammer and sentence structure to inspiration and publication. These topics are explained in such an entertaining way that non-writers are likely to be just as interested as those hoping to produce the next best-seller.     Unlike many other writing manuals, this book is written by a writer who has proved that he has what it takes to succeed in the industry and the advice contained within rings far truer than that contained in similar books written by failed romance writers, which seem to dominate the market.
0060922583|5.0|Having read through many of the fine reviews here on Michael Talbot's masterpiece, I won't bother to go into the details of the book-create an abstract, etc. for fear of repeating what's already been provided. Besides, so many reviews have captured the essences of the book much better than I could ever hope to do-especially, the review of Damian Nash (an excellent snap-shot of the book!)<br /><br />Instead, I will simply say, that if ever you have wondered beyond the realm of traditional dogma concerning life & the universe, this book is for you. It puts into proper-perspective what many of us have believed since conception but, were unable to convey. In doing so, not only does it validate our innate beliefs, it creates an assurance that life is so much more than any of us ever imagined!<br /><br />Most views on life beyond the present, fail miserably in motivating the spirit of whats to come-Holographic Universe not only addresses these issues, it also proves the possibilities are limitless (promising us that eternity will be anything but, boring!) Of course, the book also demonstrates why things are the way they are presently (via the holographic model in relation to how we influence our outcomes by thought, etc.)<br /><br />The bottom-line, buy this book! Read it-slowly. Take the time to understand the concept and appreciate the miracle that is life. Believe me, you owe it to yourself. Life is too short to live & die without knowing the why. Michael Talbot's, \\"Holographic Universe\\" should be on everybody's night stand-beside the Bible. Why? Because, in the same way the Bible centers the soul, \\"Holographic Universe\\" reminds us that our world is sound!<br /><br />Don't take my word for it-buy the book and discover it for yourself! You'll be glad you did.
B000E5KJEI|4.0|Very good quality transfer to HD DVD. Lacking in sound quality somewhat, but i think this is exagerated by the sound reproduction from my Xbox 360 HD DVD. Fairly extensive extras, particularly if you are a Clint Eastwood fan and not just an admirer of the film. Well worth a buy.
B00000K19E|5.0|Cyberpunk doesn't really exist in today's culture, but it was so apparent in the 80's, perhaps because it was so long ago, now we feel in shock when we look at the calendar and see the number 2008! I can't imagine what things will even be like in 2010! This movie single handedly slays any of those awesome 80's cyberpunk movies and takes it's place at the right hand of the cyber gods. You're not a real fan if you don't agree, this movie is the best of it's kind, and majorly entertaining, more-so to those that imagine possibilities like that actually being possible in the future. You need to have an imagination to love this movie, and be in awe of all the far out sci-fi ideas, that's what all the great sci-fi movies are supposed to do, awe you with their vision of how things could be in the future. And they say that sci-fi movies quite literally fortell reality! I get tired of medieval movies, and action, but I love cyber stuff so much. It's like the movie Transformers, a typical person will dismiss it as a regular movie, but a real fan will love it so much, and love the music, and love the hot chick, and love the action scenes, and the special effects, and even the story. A real fan watches a movie and gets ideas for his own story from it to turn into a movie. Since watching this movie I've become so thoroughly full of ideas of what could be that I started a website dealing with cyberpunk, all influenced by this movie. It's called: VERSUS. And you can find it at [...] I have my selection of cyber movies, zombie movies, horror, all on site from Amazon! Check it out!!
B00000G3PA|1.0|It was everything that I would expect from director Michael Bay - a summer blockbuster filled with every action/thiller/sci-fi cliché known to man that completely undermines science, logic and reason. Obviously, these kinds of movies are not made for cognitive minds. They are made for people who like watching American Idol and Dancing with the Stars.
140130916X|5.0|I really, really, really like this book:).  It is so beautifully written it made want to meet Cecelia and give her a big hug:).   I would stay up all night just to see what would come next; fighting every invitation to hit the sack my body would extend me.   Yes: I fell truly, madly and deeply for Gerry and Holly's playful/stressful/sexy/spiritual bond, and Holly's initial desperation made me crack up--definitely not in a good way.   It also gave me an enormous amount of food for thought, which I hope I can profit from for many years to come, and, again, I reveled in Cecelia's concinnity. In two words: Bravo, Cecelia:):)!!
141694737X|5.0|My 18 month old absolutely loves this book!  He will bring it to me first before all the others.  He loves lifting all the flaps and finding all the animals.  The book also helps him learn all the names of all the different animals at the zoo.  Definitely a wonderful purchase and highly recommended.
B00000JCOV|5.0|This album has been around for a while, but it still seems to be generating a lot of fiery opinions. Mostly, strongly negative ones and the backlash from them. Anyway, here are my two cents.    This album has a very raw, aggressive feel to it. It sort of sounds like a bunch of angry people getting together and just beating the hell out of a bunch of instruments. The music is not very technical, although it is quite catchy. This is the sort of album that makes for good punching-holes-in-the-drywall (make sure to check for studs first) music. The guitars are less prominent than in [[ASIN:B00005A46T Iowa]], and this CD is much more aggressive and simple than [[ASIN:B0006HBL2S Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses]]. Overall, this is not a good album if you insist on extreme technicality, but it is good for releasing pent-up aggression and just having a blast banging your head. I happen to enjoy this album a lot.    By the way, some of you people need to calm down. I like death metal, black metal, grindcore, thrash metal, etc. just as much as the next person. As long as somebody is screaming/growling/shrieking at me, I'm good. It isn't fair to judge a band by comparing them to another. Take the music for what it is. Whether you like it or don't, just calmly tell us why. I hope I have been of some help.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I went into this movie fully expecting a Princess Bride knockoff, and as I didn't even like that movie very much, my expectations were pretty low. So what do we have waiting for us? Wicked witches? Check. Handsome princes? Check. Magic and unicorns? Check. All pretty common so far, and in fact pretty common throughout. So imagine my surprise when, approximately an hour and a half in, I check the time, knowing this cannot go on much longer, and yet I'm utterly despairing with dread the approaching end. There are a very few tales I've encountered that when finished I've wished could've gone on and on and on... The Hobbit when I read that as a child, and to my delightful surprise its continuation The Lord of the Rings. Star Wars of course, since I can remember, at least until the prequels came out. The Last Unicorn. And... this.     Yes there's not much original material here, but it's the journey that stays with you, and here is a journey, a story told with grand earnestness. Yes boy falls in love with pretty hometown girl, but along the way you see the rapport between Tristan and Yvaine; first the spiteful barbs and then the playful teases. You begin to see his original love interest as the flat, uninteresting doll she is and silently hope for him to open his eyes and see Yvaine as the infinitely more worthy woman. And somewhere along the way, you fall into the screen, into this world, utterly believing it, and finally dread the end that must be bittersweet for you that you must leave.    It's the actors that make this movie, especially the leads. Charlie Cox as the young Tristan breathes the awkward vigor of youth. Claire Danes is luminously sublime, yet vulnerable as Yvaine. Michelle Pfeiffer relishes the wickedness of her witch, though her voice needed to age with her appearance. DeNiro was surprising, though I thought he could've hammed it up even more with the flaming persona. The English cast was perfect, esp. the ghost chorus of princes. All in all a story toshare far and wide; come for the fantasy, stay for the rousing story, leave loving forever these characters.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Shakespeare reimagined with samurai steel.  Kurosawa takes a stab at Macbeth, and the translation is bloody brilliant.  All the universal themes are still intact--ambition, selfishness, guilt, fear, despair...and of course betrayal.<br />Here's a brief summary--a ghostly spirit predicts that a couple of brave warriors will rise into power.  This prophecy becomes reality, but with this power comes great responsibility.  Everything soon goes spiraling out of control.<br />The acting is tremendous--Toshiro Mifune absolutely shines as the neurotic ruler.  Kurosawa once again presents some bleak and striking images that will engulf you in the period.<br />Really the only weakness of Throne of Blood is its inevitable comparisons to Kurosawa's other masterpieces.  It's nearly impossible for any film to match the visual splendour of Ran or Kagemusha.  Plus this film seems overshadowed by the gritty realism of Seven Samurai or Yojimbo.  Akira set the bar so high, it's difficult to match his other work.  4.5 stars.
0553588486|2.0|This book was very well written but I am clearly not a member of the target audience. Game of Thrones read like a Soap Opera. Perhaps, the fact that over 1,000 gave this book 5 stars should have tipped me off. It is back to something a bit more toothy; like, Erikson's Malazon Book of the Fallen...

It's turned me into a believer.
B000ZLFALI|2.0|I am a huge fan of the Beatles, and of Julie Taymor, however I felt that this was possibly the most forced movie I'd ever seen. The music was good for the most part, and and visuals were stunning...however, is that all we look for in a film? I believe that Across The Universe would have made a stunning piece of live theatre because the cheesiness and the disbelief are much easier to accomplish on the stage without being just that--cheesy! The film was not only forced and cheesy, but EXTREMELY predictable! AND, I was shocked at how American a movie surrounded by the Beatles music could be.<br /><br />The movie was not horrible by any means. I just couldn't believe the reviews that had been posted on here so far. I waited almost a year to see this film, and could not have left the Theater less impressed.<br /><br />If you want to see something amazing set to Beatles music, go to Las Vegas and see \\"Love.\\" THAT is a genius, well thought out show without an ounce of in your face forced plot.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|Matt Damon is fantastic in these Bourne movies, he has that All-American look, but with that loner edge that makes Jason Bourne believeable.  This most recent installment of the Bourne series is as good as the the first Bourne movie, frankly I felt the second, though good, didnt have the story of the Identity or the Ultimatum.  These movies are so fast paced, the action permiates the movie and propels it at break neck speed.  I could give you a synopsis of the movie, but if you've seen it you know what it's about and if you havent I dont want to give anything away, suffive to say, if you like a movie with thrills and with all the qualities that make a truely great action film, then there is NOWAY you're not going to think this movie rocks.  Highly recommended, arguably the best of the series.
B000FA6720|5.0|I've read the reviews on here, both positive and negative. I've also read this book, five times now. It is a story of a woman who has given up herself for the benefit of others, a scenario many people, both male and female, can relate to. When it comes to following our dreams, or doing the right thing by our families, our families usually win. The difference is, we are not usually allowed to grieve our loss. We push it down, keep a stiff upper lip and keep moving. This story has been such a popular one, because so many people can identify with the feelings of the main character, Francesca.<br />One reviewer asked, What if the story had been of a male farmer who had an affair with a female photographer, and then goes back to his unsuspecting wife. If he suffered the same agonizing choice, I think it would be just as important and moving as a story. I loved this book. I thought it was much better than the movie. Meryl Streep was Francesca, but Clint Eastwood just didn't seem like Robert Kincaid to me. So read, and imagine Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges. You'll love it.
B000K7VHQE|4.0|This was a cute film, that really flys because of some wonderful performances.  The story is essentially about a plucky little girl, whose belief in herself and inner spirit makes members of her family realize things about life and what's ultimately important.  The acting is top notch in this, with Arkin winning an Academy Award for his great preformance, but it's the little girl that steals the show with her eyes that convey so much in their innocent gaze.
0307387178|1.0|Simply put, there was just not enough relevant material to warrant a book. In order to fill out his original magazine article to book length, Krakauer takes bird-walk after circuitous bird-walk with mind-numbing redundancy. How often does one need to emphasize \\"it was his last (fill in the blank)\\"? Beyond the first and final few chapters, the rest is irrelevant fluff that verges on deification of a pretty standard disillusioned youth searching to find himself. The story is interesting in a way that a car accident on the side of the road is, little more, but Krakauer treats the subject with such reverence that you would think him a latter day saint. Save time and read the Outside magazine article.

B000GTJT0W|5.0|I loved this movie!<br /><br />The opening sequence is so incredible. An absolutely wonderful contribution to film!<br /><br />The rest of this film is also great. This is what an action movie should be like. It takes you to places you don't see and captures them beautifully.<br /><br />Great villains, great heroes, great supporting roles - the whole mix makes for an interesting viewing experience. Total fun...oh and that poor beautiful boat! You'll see.<br /><br />I'm sure somebody might disagree, but if you ask me, as someone who takes a film for what it is, I'd say this one's a definite keeper!<br /><br />The HD DVD picture is astonishing (of course the camera crew has their role in that too) and the aduio is engaging (although among the many choices Dolby True HD is not one of them - the DD+ is still great), well edited film all the way around!<br /><br />Lots of unique creative situations. Lots of action. I've just got to say it again - I love this film!<br /><br />I so highly recommend \\"Sahara\\"!
0316743003|5.0|Why can't Hollywood make a movie out of this? Wait, I take it back. They'd probably turn the Rich and Kelly relationship into an affair, and throw in some cliche ridiculousness about how white, rich guys are evil.    That being said, WHAT A GREAT BOOK! This is wonderful tale of how a group of men with wonderful leadership did what it took to be the best while ignoring all the bureaucratic roadblocks. They really show what it takes to be on the cutting edge. On time, below budget, and meeting specifications.  Some do their best to imitate the Skunk Works model, but few understand the philosophy of this men: rational egoism.
B000YA82F6|5.0|Juno is a great movie... I loved it!  When I see previews to a movie that looks good, I usually end up disappointed, but not with this movie! Juno is a girl who gets pregnant with her best friend's baby and doesn't believe it at first. After a gallon of Sunny D and 3 pregnancy tests, she finally accepts the fact that she is in fact pregnant. She plans to get an abortion but after hearing that her baby already has fingernails, she decides to give it up for adoption. Juno finds the perfect family to give her baby to and ends up going through many ups and downs over the nine month period. She discovers that no matter what happens in your life, you can be happy.    I thought that Ellen Page did amazing job acting; I couldn't imagine anyone as a better Juno.  There were points in the movie where it seemed to be leaning towards a drama instead of a comedy but overall, a very funny movie.  There wasn't much time that went by between the outbursts of laughter in the audience.  I would recommend this movie to anyone, people of all ages will be able to laugh at the humor of Juno!
B000002LRX|3.0|FNM were an excellent art metal band and gave a great wad of interesting, sometimes intriguing art to the world. Alas they also generally failed to truly communicate with their prospective audience, wearing the listener out with many varied twists and turns. Which, if your going to wear out an audience is the way to do it!<br /><br />So on the up side here we have a band full of confidence and really going for it, exploring their particular vision of artistically challenging (but never prog) musings to a market demographic that struggled to keep up. On this album the boys start to delve further into the sort of musical landscape that would be further defined on later albums, a whole range of songs here that court mellow, not quite lounge, stylings presumably following Pattons obvious love of gentle crooning as well as a few tongue in cheek silly boys stuff like Jizzlobber and more arty tunes such as Everythings Ruined and the somewhat strange but highly effective Be Aggressive, a song where your never sure just how much drugs the band were on during it's writing and recording sessions!<br /><br />The downside is the lack of connectivity in some of the more labyrinth like constructs and you'd have to be a real zealot to claim to go along with every turn and twist tried out on this disc.<br /><br />Ultimately this album showed the band were willing to be quite courageous and go further out on a limb and risk their fan base. They needn't have worried as many of the fans they attracted with their earlier efforts were not `fair weather friends' but indeed the kind of people who kept on picking up their albums and going to their tours, allowing the band a sense of artistic freedom that I'm sure must have made them the envy of many others on the circuit.<br /><br />Note that in some territories there were versions of this album released with an ep of four live bonus tracks - Easy, Be Aggressive, Kindergarten, Mark Bowen. Not life changing but if your lucky enough to track this version down it adds to the value and who knows, may actually help you decide if you want to buy this bands Live at Brixton Academy release.e value and who knows, may actually help you decide if you want to buy this bands Live at Brixton Academy release.
1932100385|5.0|Finally,  an author who makes sense of all the conflicting recommendations out there,  concerning the effects of diet on our health.  He demonstrates clearly how thousands of scientific studies of different kinds (longitudinal,  cross-cultural,  laboratory) converge repeatedly on the same sensible message,  \\"You are what you eat.\\"  He waits until the end of the book to explain the big question:  Why have we been misinformed for so long,  by so many stellar, reputable sources?  This book is a must read for EVERYONE.  It is also interesting and fascinating, full of human stories as well as understandable and irrefutable statistics that drive home the points:  Eating meat and dairy products is a bad habit of western, affluent societies that causes most of the diseases that cost lives, happiness, and that drain our wealth.
0525950079|4.0|a (loose)continuation of follett's acclaimed \\"pillars of the earth\\", this one picks up the story of kingsbride priory and town on the eve of the plague. I was most intrigued with the developing and, in my opinion, accurate analysis of the changing relationships between merchant towns, wealth and the clergy. World Without End really did a great job to humanize this historic struggle between a growing secular and urban mercantile class and the conservative priory and bishopric. I found that the storyline was not as engaging as I had hoped it would be. Coming in just over 1000 pages, I expected something with a little bit more to \\"take home\\" when i closed the book, but instead it seems to leave off much as it began. Perhaps in respect to the title, i found that the ending was - without end. Recommended.

B000VJ271A|5.0|To date the reference recording -- by default, given the virtual absence of other DVD format productions -- has been the 2001 performance at the Bastille Opera with Renee Fleming and Marcelo Alvarez.  David McVicar's production, from Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu, changes the landscape considerably, in several regards. It's a shame that the 2006 Los Angeles Opera production, directed by Vincent Patterson, was not recorded.  Ideally, a collection of opera on DVD would have both the Barcelona and the Los Angeles performances, because the real choice, I think, lies between these two conceptions.  The Bastille production is sumptuous in many ways, with superlative musical direction (Lopez-Cobos), visually alluring period sets and costumes cast in a spectrum of sherbet colors that defy description, and the estimable presence of Fleming and Alvarez.  I think those who love this performance may find it hard to enter the world McVicar and his star soprano, Natalie Dessay, create at the Liceu.  McVicar's production is an imaginative and powerful invocation of Hogarth's (not to mention Goya's) seedy eighteenth-century street scenes and claustrophobic interiors.  McVicar presents a world still tinted with signs of former luxury but pervasively marked by neglect and decay.  The color palette throughout the staging, for example, is dominated by shades of taupe, moss green, and grey, so much so that it is hard to detect the arrival of Manon in the famous Cours-la-Reine scene, and it is also positively shocking to see Manon appear in brilliant crimson in the gambling scene. In some ways, that's the trade-off: we don't get the easy visual pleasure of the cinematic spectacle, but we do get a pretty powerful dose of the scandal. This is to say that the purely visual dimension of McVicar's production is polemical: he is not aiming to satisfy our desire to see yet another version of the rags to riches story in charming 18th-century porcelain, and I would guess the point here is not simply that we know how the story ends but that MiVicar wants to remind us that the world in which Manon tries to survive is sumptuous only in a superficial and extremely precarious way, never far from its callous and mercenary underbelly.<br /><br />So, fair warning: those seeking a visually seductive performance of Manon should buy (or stick with) the Bastille production.  On the other hand, McVicar's staging is harrowing and moving beyond belief -- it may not correspond to the sentimentality of Massenet's score but it surely conveys more of the spirit of Prevost's 18th-century novel.  Indeed, I think the astringent staging presented here goes miles toward helping us hear Massenet's music differently, and better.  Surely McVicar has ideal partners in Dessay and Villazon.  There is simply no comparison between Dessay and Fleming, or between Villazon and Alvarez.  All four, of course, are superlative singers, but Dessay's Manon is specific, vulnerable, complicated, and ultimately devastating in ways that Fleming's Manon only gestures at, in beautifully composed but oddly inert ways.  To be sure, Dessay's laser-like timbre does not convey Fleming's vocal opulence but neither does Fleming's Manon traverse the dramatic arc that Dessay presents in crushing detail.  (Compare the Saint-Sulpice scenes in each version and you'll see and hear what I mean.) Similarly, Alvarez's Des Grieux is beautifully sung but generalized; Villazon's is also beautifully sung but it is also believably raw and exposed.  The Liceu set does have a weak element, but it is not a major liability: unfortunately, Samuel Ramey was cast rather too late in his career to make an impact in the paternal role of the Comte Des Grieux.  That said, if the choice is now between the Liceu and Bastille productions, I'd go for the Liceu.  [The Los Angeles production boasted an even more passionately sung Des Grieux and the stunning Manon of Anna Netrebko, placed in a deliberately over-the-top staging filtered through the lens of '40s and '50s Hollywood film melodrama.  You either loved it or hated it -- but, unlike the Bastille production, the LA conception presents a real alternative to what Liceu so movingly creates.]he lens of '40s and '50s Hollywood film melodrama.

B000NVT0RU|5.0|\\"Indig&egrave;nes\\" is a superb film with wonderful and talented actors, soulful music (I immediately bought the soundtrack), and beautiful cinematography. It tells a story that has long needed to be told, and one that I'm ashamed to say I knew nothing about. The film shows all too clearly the damage that bigotry and prejudice can do, but it also clearly illustrates the amazing courage of these men and the belief that they would undoubtedly, eventually, get their due.<br /><br />It also shows the power and impact that art can have, for the French government changed its laws regarding the war pensions of its indigenous veterans as a direct result. In the film, Sami Bouajila's character, Abdelkader, says: \\"On est en train de changer le destin de la France. Il est temps que les choses elles changent pour nous aussi\\" (\\"We are changing France's destiny. It is time for things to change for us as well\\"). Unfortunately, that change took a very long time.<br /><br />I highly suggest watching the \\"Making of\\" feature on the DVD; it's very interesting to hear from the actors, who, they discovered, each had parents or grandparents who had been a soldier in the African forces that helped to liberate France.<br /><br />I speak French and am learning Arabic, so I very much enjoyed the back and forth between the two languages (though my Arabic is not good enough that I could go without subtitles, unfortunately).<br /><br />DIRECTOR: Rachid Bouchareb<br />WRITERS: Rachid Bouchareb and Olivier Lorelle<br />MAIN ACTORS: Jamel Debbouze (\\"Saïd Otmari\\"), Samy Naceri (\\"Yassir\\"), Roschdy Zem (\\"Messaoud Souni\\"), Sami Bouajila (\\"Abdelkader\\"), Bernard Blancan (\\"Sergent Roger Martinez\\")<br /><br />AWARDS:<br />- Academy Awards (2007): nominated for \\"Best Foreign Language Film of the Year\\" from Algeria<br />- Critics Choice Award (2007): won \\"Best Foreign Language Film\\"<br />- C&eacute;sar Awards in France (2007): won \\"Best Writing - original\\" and nominated in 8 other categories<br />- Image Awards (2007): nominated for \\"Outstanding Independent or Foreign Film\\"<br />- Independent Spirit Awards (2007): nominated for \\"Best Foreign Film\\" from France / Morocco / Algeria / Belgium<br />- Lumiere Awards in France (2007): won \\"Best Screenplay\\"<br />- &Eacute;toile d'Or (2007): won \\"Best Film\\"<br />- Toronto Film Festival: official selection<br />- Cannes Film Festival (2006): won \\"Best Actor\\" for the male ensemble cast, François Chalais Award, and nominated for the Golden Palm; official selection<br /><br />P.S.:<br />I knew I recognized Sami Bouajila, the actor who plays Abdelkader, so for those of you who were also being driven crazy by this, he played Samir Nazhde, Annette Bening's Palestinian boyfriend, in \\"The Siege.\\"endent Spirit Awards (2007): nominated for \\"Best Foreign Film\\" from France / Morocco / Algeria / Belgium  - Lumiere Awards in France (2007): won \\"Best Screenplay\\"  - Étoile d'Or (2007): won \\"Best Film\\"  - Toronto Film Festival: official selection  - Cannes Film Festival (2006): won \\"Best Actor\\" for the male ensemble cast, François Chalais Award, and nominated for the Golden Palm; official selection    P.S.:  I knew I recognized Sami Bouajila, the actor who plays Abdelkader, so for those of you who were also being driven crazy by this, he played Samir Nazhde, Annette Bening's Palestinian boyfriend, in \\"The Siege.\\"
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|There are so many positive reviews of this adaptation already that I'm sure mine isn't necessary but I can't help but sharing just how much I enjoy this movie. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite novels and I am a great fan of period adaptations so I've seen my fair share of versions of this novel and many others. For me, this is the best adaptation of Jane Eyre made to date and I wouldn't be surprised if it remained that way. Toby Stephens is an excellent Mr. Rochester and I think captures all of his many complicated sides - his abrasive manner, his inner pain and turmoil, and his humor and wit. Too many version in my opinion portray him as dark and brooding only. While this is an essential part of his character - there is much more to him - there is an appeal, a vulnerability, and a passion that is just as important. And the same can be said for Ruth Wilson as Jane. She too brilliantly combines Jane's reserve and somber character while imbuing her with an adventurous and passionate spirit that come through in her subtle sparkle and sweetness that are captivating.     I think what makes this version the best is that you really get a sense of the chemistry between Mr. Rochester and Jane - you feel it from the very beginning as they seem to do. I also like that this version incorporates the sensuality and the electricity between them rather than shying away from it.    Altogether it is so well done. If you love the novel, you'll love this movie.
B000UX6THK|3.0|When Twin Peaks originally aired I was freshly turned 28. Thinking about what was on television at the time, I can see where this series may have held my attention. Watching the entire series again for the first time in nearly 20 years, I found myself somewhat disappointed... What seemed wildly entertaining in 1990 seems like an incredible waste of time now. I found myself wincing in pain at some of the really poor acting. If you read the bios on 99% of the actors in this series, you'll find some mention regarding Twin Peaks being the \\"peak\\" of their career. This is most likely, a good thing. Dana Ashbrook, Eric DaRe and most notably Grace Zabriskie...HORRIBLE! Did David Lynch actually run casting sessions or is the cast of Twin Peaks a \\"who's who\\" of his close personal friends? I suspect now, that a large part of my fascination with this series when it originally aired was the bevy of beauties assembled by Lynch. I hadn't seen Peggy Lipton since \\"Mod Sqaud\\" and Michael Ontkean since \\"Slapshot\\". Sherilyn Fenn, Lara Flynn Boyle, Madchen Amick, Joan Chen, Sheryl Lee...I feel like a dirty, old man watching it now. Television has changed in the past 20 years and so have I. It was amusing to watch the show again, nostalgic. Will I wait another 20 years before I watch this again? Probably.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I was so looking forward to this new version of Persuasion. I love the story but have never been altogether happy with the 1995 version staring Amanda Root. I found her portrayal of Anne Elliot a little lacking - perhaps because of age as one other reviewer notes. I liked Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth but found the majority of the other characters not up to my expectations. Overall, that version always seems to me a little flat.    I am sorry to say that this new adaptation did not do much better. I was very disappointed with the way that essential scenes were altered and I felt that the story was overall too rushed. I wish they had allowed themselves another 20-30 minutes to give enough time for the story to develop or found away to make it work within the 90 minutes they had. I am not opposed to Rupert Penry-Jones as Wentworth - he is dashing and offers a good portrayal for the most part. I can't say I was as impressed with Sally Hawkins. There was something a little awkward about her. I didn't think she was a bad Anne Elliot - just not quite what I expected. I agree with one of the other reviewers assessments of her sisters - Mary is unnecessarily irritating - at times she was too comically overdone - and Elizabeth is not attractive at all.    Finally - although the setting and score were very well done, some of the camera work was off-putting. There were alot of strange angles and cut-away shots that made certain moments a little difficult to watch.    I guess I will just have to hope that a better version is done in the future.
B000H7JCIW|4.0|\\"Liza Live from Radio City Music Hall\\" is an excellent live concert recording DVD that seems to suffer in undeserved obscurity alongside its beloved stable mate, \\"Liza with a Z.\\" It gives us a young Liza, star of stage, screen and television, at the top of her form. It was made by many talented hands, and won a Primetime Emmy, so its obscurity is surely not deserved.<br /><br />For starters, it was written for the stage and directed by Fred Ebb, of the greatly talented pair of songwriters from whom Minelli has gotten some of her most famous material ---try \\"Cabaret,\\" or even \\"Chicago.\\" It was choreographed by Susan Stroman, who has gone from triumph to triumph on Broadway recently - try \\"The Producers.\\" (And Stroman actually directed the recent movie version of that hit play.)  \\"Live\\" was produced by multi-talented Phil Ramone, directed by reliable tv hand Louis J. Horvitz.  Jazzman Billy Stritch gets credit for musical supervision.  Clothing was by esteemed designer Isaac Mizrahi; Liza's makeup was by deservedly popular Kevyn Aucoin.  And then, of course, we get Minelli herself, backed by a good-sized orchestra that occasionally sings too, and her \\"Demon Divas,\\" a group of women that's unusually inclusive by age and size, who sing and dance like, well, demons.<br /><br />Then there's the star of course, one of the belters in the great tradition of her mother, beloved star of stage and screen, Judy Garland.  Each can pack a song full of emotion while belting it out, but can still deliver a quiet one; can act out a song as few others, and can change pace on the spot.  In addition, as a younger woman, Minelli's generally got more energy than her mother. The young star had not yet begun to have voice or hip troubles; she can work up a sweat dancing, and still deliver the goods vocally.<br /><br />For the first act, Minelli joins us in Mizrahi's famous white trenchcoat. That act is on the quieter side, with memorable solo versions of \\"Teach Me Tonight,\\" \\"Old Friends,\\" and a cynical number Lotte Lenya introduced in 1929 Berlin, cabaret time, \\"So What.\\" It concludes with a work by the French singer-songwriter Charles Aznavour, in that language, for a lovely emotional-laden tribute to Minelli's father.  He, Vincente Minelli, went from art director at Radio City, as a young man during the 1930's, to a famous director of movie musicals.<br /><br />The singer speeds up the second act.  She's joined on stage by the Demon Divas; don't ask me why, but the way they were salted away in the audience, and stood up to demand to join her onstage just made me uneasy.  But they sure do a job of work.  During several medleys, the star and her divas give us fresh versions of favorite \\"Cabaret\\" tunes, a new take on her mother's \\"The Man I Love,\\" a sexy, high-energy, white-gloved tribute to her close associate Bob Fosse, and a high-stepping, ever-so-appropriate to the venue, Rockette style tap dance.  And soaked in sweat, lubricious in a bright red dress, she gives us an electrifying version of her signature, \\"New York, New York,\\" backed by those divas, in black Mizrahi trenchcoats this time.  The number of people who love Liza is no puzzle.  What is?

B000WTNCQS|5.0|It was worth waiting the whole month to get this package, and my heart was over beaten when I got my hands on it. It is a black box in whole reminding some kind of the special \\"Bible\\". I've started with studying the book, it contains interesting remarks and comments about this record, and interesting stories around how it all was created. An interesting fact to know what a big smoker Flood was when making this awesome sound. Further I've watched the DVD, I am not sure a \\"rare\\" version of \\"With Or Without You\\" video is not just a version which was created recently for the die-hard fans and the snippets used there were not actually taken from the original shooting of the well-known version... However it's special. The same special is the concert in Paris; I was laughing when Bono was caught by that big fat guy; and also when he stopped the \\"WOWY\\" song just because he disliked what was appearing before the scene. Original Audio CD patronaged by The Edge via Pro Tools now is much bigger pleasure to listen as their previous studio version; and the Bonus Audio CD full of the best B-sides I've ever heard from U2 is of course worth listening not just the one time.    It is the favorite albums of all times for me... What could I say? The package impressed me a lot! It's definitely worth of $50 since it's not only a pleasure to have it by a U2 fan, but probably a great gift for any good listener who understands the music.

B00023B1LC|4.0|As many of you probably already know, The Bourne Identity is the first of the three installments of the Bourne film trilogy. It is loosely based on the Novel by Robert Ludlum of the same name. I had already watched this film long before I realized that it was based on a novel and that there were actually three total books involving the Bourne character, all of which would soon have their own film adaptations. With all of that said, I was initially surprised on how good this film really was. I had my doubts that Matt Damon would be able to pull off a character like Jason Bourne. For some reason, Matt Damon just doesn't come to my mind when you think action star, but he really pulled it off here. Not only Damon, but the supporting cast is good as well, with Franka Potente, Chris Cooper, Clive Owen, and Julia Styles all having good performances. But what I loved about this movie was the pacing. This film has very few slow parts in it, but yet it isn't just all over-the-top action either. There's a very good balance to the film. And during the more action-packed sequences, it isn't just senseless action for the sake of action, there's a purpose behind it. The main reason for this is simply because this a good story, and it keeps the audience entertained. There's more than just one storyline happening throughout the film as you get to follow the Jason Bourne character as he tries to find out just who he really is. I really don't have many negative things to say about this film. The only thing I would change would be the last action sequence in the film involving the Bourne character jumping off a staircase and shooting someone. I really thought that was completely unrealistic. Another thing that has really nothing to do with the movie, it's about the packaging of this DVD. This is supposed the the Extended Edition with a bunch of special features. But in reality, there's not a lot of difference in this edition and the regular one. There's a few more little featurettes and an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special. Heck, this isn't even a 2-disc DVD! So, if you already have this movie and not this edition, then you're not missing much. But if you're thinking about purchasing this film for the first time, I highly recommend it to any fan of not only the action genre, but anyone who just wants to see a well-paced, well written story that will keep you entertained.d an alternate beginning and ending (which I didn't care too much for), and a few little other things, but nothing real special.

B0011TQLA2|5.0|The reviews here are excellent and informative, and they should tell you all you need to purchase this album.  I'll add that In Rainbows is one of the finest albums in recent memory, and arguably Radiohead's best.  At no point has the band been so economical in its craft; every song is wonderful, each enhances the songs coming before and after it, and every song is crafted to perform a specific function on the album.  No noise is wasted, nothing is thrown in just for kicks.  The production is stunning and really requires headphones to fully appreciate. This is an adult album by the closest thing we've had to The Beatles since The Beatles.  Buy it if you care about music.

1932907009|4.0|Mr. Snyder is a wonderful writer and what he writes makes sense. I would recommend this book to any aspiring screenwriter. However, I disagree with the idea that one should write what's popular and only write for young crowds. One should aspire to write an entertaining story period. Write what you know.     If you are a forty year old man with ideas for screenplays with 40 year old characters, that is what you should be writing. We don't need another Christmas movie about 30-somethings. Look at the success of Wild Hogs, City Slickers, The Unforgiven. Uncreative, regurgitated, youth-centric movies is why we don't pay for movie tickets anymore. Keep in mind, I am a 30-something person (and I saw 2 out of 3 of the above mentioned).    Okay, I am done now. Summary: it's a good book and worth buying;)
1596912855|5.0|I approached Austenland with a lot of trepidation - but I absolutely loved it! It was smart and funny and sweet, but never lapsed into being saccharine - the sense of humor was too sharp (and Austen-esque!) for that. The heroine was brave and intelligent and well-worthy of being rooted for - I loved how she stood up for herself, and her witty Regency dialogue made me cheer! The Austen references are smart, snarky, and completely on-target, and the situation is hilariously wacky, with all the humor drawn out perfectly. Despite how funny and sparkly it was on the surface, though, there was so much emotional honesty in this book, I desperately needed to find out what would happen in the end - and it exceeded all my expectations. Perfect! :)

B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Once I finally found this show, I was really saddened to learn that it was already cancelled.  When I discovered the movie, I was thrilled that it tied up most of the loose ends but still left it open enough for a sequel.

B000ETQPYM|1.0|boring, immature, elementary....   very cheesy, very anti-climatic ending, was like this is it?  did i really spend all that time reading this?  not a good book, spend your time reading something else.. Don't mean to bash C. Ahern's book she has some potential just needs more practice, guidance, and more exciting plot!!
B000VWYJ86|5.0|I enjoyed this Bourne as much as the previous two and could not wait to add it to my movie collection!  I watched it immediately upon arrival!  Another excellent additon.

B000U0F7RG|5.0|This is a very good series, my daughter loves it and we have been watching it everyday since we got it.
B000J10KTQ|3.0|Its not that I didn't enjoy this movie. I liked it enough to buy it. Its just not the grand reboot of the franchise that I had hoped for. I understand things have to change and people have to change, but I just didn't see this as a movie to begin a whole new chapter of the man in blue. I now read online that the next movie will not even have Routh recast. So, now that you've restarted the thing you switch the central character casting already? I think the Batman reboot was handled much better. All that being said, the movie is really enjoyable in its own light. The HD audio and video are great as well, if you can take advantage of that.
0618680004|5.0|This is pretty well written and entertaining.  I have the book-on-disk version and, I have to say, hearing it read by the author probably adds quite a bit to the experience.<br /><br />I found quite a lot to agree with.  Of course, in this case, Dawkins is \\"preaching to the choir\\". [sic]<br /><br />A few minor things I disagreed with:<br /><br />- dismissing Buddhism as not really a religion but more of a philosophy...well, there are many kinds of Buddhism and for sure the ones I am most familiar with involve praying to the Buddha and belief in reincarnation.  This sounds like religion to me.<br /><br />- Dawkins focusses more on \\"belief in god\\" whereas to me the real meat of religion is \\"belief in a soul\\" (Dualism).  If Dualism is an accurate belief (which I seriously doubt), then it seems to make the existence of a God-force more likely.<br /><br />- the multi-verse stuff seems like more religion to me.  There is no evidence.<br /><br />Well, I'm not finished with the book yet...maybe there's something I haven't seen yet.<br /><br />In any case, the most relavent thing to me was the discussion of anti-atheism which is as bad as racism in America.  I have to agree.
B000I2JKE2|4.0|I had never seen this version before, and I have to say I like it better that the original. Everything ties into together better.   With the HD DVD transfer, its hard to believe this film was made so many years ago. The audio and video are great. If you like Superman, you need this version of Superman II.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is truly hilarious, sure to entertain and delight fans of horror, comedy, and horror/comedy. The acting is exceptional, especially Simon Pegg, who plays Shaun. The comedy is not really slapstick or in-your-face jokes but more of an understated type of humor, which is especially effective in this setting.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Shaun, who when we meet him is dealing with the problem of juggling time between his girlfriend and his best friend, who is somehwat of a- well- loser. One thing this movie does very well is establish character, so that during the movie you really get to know and identify with them. Shaun is portrayed as a sort of Avergae Joe or everyman, who shuffles back and forth from his \\"flat\\" (as they say in England) to his menial job. The idea that a poor slob like Shaun would end up having to save the world from the undead is the basic premise, and irony, of the film. The funniest moments come when Shaun goes about the mundane tasks of his life, oblivious to the horror around him (people dropping over dead, bloodstains in the shop he enters, etc.) The movie is brilliantly written, and all of the actors do a wonderful job at making the humor work.<br /><br />I would not call this a parody of horror movies, as there is some gore and violence; it works on many levels and cannot be easily pigeonholed. It sort of transcends a genre, which to me is a sign of a great movie.<br /><br />One of the most originial, intelligently written, and best acted movies I have seen lately. You will not be disappointed in this.
0714834491|5.0|This book is a tour de force of creativity and it is suitable for everyone, not just graphic designers. Each page is so thick and rich that you shouldn't browse through it. I highly recommend you limit yourself to 1 page a day so you can absorb and digest what it contains. It is a stunning whack of creativity that you need to take slowly. Over time this book will help you to see and to think in different ways and with significantly more \\"creativity\\".<br /><br />If you consider yourself to be a creative person you absolutely, positively, have to get this book. It will change you.

B000R7I3LY|4.0|Just this past weekend, I got introduced to the breezy, catchy sound of Sara Bareilles when I first saw her video for \\"Love Song\\".  Whatever 'It' is, she's got 'It'.  Her voice is so catchy that she it bursts this song beyond just being the pleasant confectionary that it is.      Bareilles has more energy and attitude to her singing than her contemporaries.  She has been compared to Norah Jones regularly and may get grouped in with the soft ballad types like Colbie Caillat.  But, based on this first song, I'm believe she's so much more.  Jones and Caillat produce pleasant music, but its very slow and sleep-inducing.  Bareilles, on the other hand, will keep your foot tapping.      I'm looking forward to hearing more from this refreshing new artist.

B000002OX7|5.0|This was the second Who album I ever got, on Halloween of 2000.  Though at that point I was still only becoming a more serious fan, this was one album I loved and got into right away.  It helped that I was familiar with a number of the songs already, and because so many songs from this album are classic rock staples, it really seems like the ideal introductory album for a new fan.  Really, what more could be said about this album that hasn't already been said?  I know some people feel it's overrated, which could be a valid point given all of the attention given to this album over other of the band's masterpieces, but even though it seems to get more popular attention and acclaim than equally great albums like 'Quadrophenia' and 'Sell Out,' it's still an awesome perfect album.  Some people also might feel it's overrated because it seems to be their most commercially successful, but just because an album is a big commercial success and really overplayed on the radio doesn't mean it's less worthwhile than an album that critics often ignore.<br /><br />Back when I first got this album and was in the process of getting acquainted with it, I was so impressed with it that after listening to it, I would sometimes push play and listen to it all over again.  The measure of a truly great album is if one wants to listen to it all over again immediately, if there are no bad tracks (or at least the lesser tracks aren't the types one wants to skip), and if it never gets old, if one still loves it long after first experiencing it.  I personally no longer rate it quite as highly on my list of favorite Who records, perhaps because so many of the songs are so overplayed on the radio, but it still sounds so fresh, moving, and wonderful so many years later.  Now I tend to only play the original first nine tracks (what song worth its salt is worthy of following \\"WGFA\\"?), but the bonus tracks are just as great as the original ones.  While later on the remastering team did kind of seem to get lazy and not put as much care and effort into choosing enough bonus tracks, this is one they did get right, with the album's original running length about doubled.  Good bonus tracks don't detract from the original album material but only make it even better.  This album also works so well for so many purposes--listening to while working out, while getting ready in the morning, to wake up to, while driving down the road, in hot weather, and, perhaps most importantly of all, as a springboard for the new fan to want to explore more Who albums.and not put as much care and effort into choosing enough bonus tracks, this is one they did get right, with the album's original running length about doubled.

B00065MDRW|5.0|I'm probably in good company with many CD buyers who purchase remasters of 1960s recordings with great anticipation only to feel rather let down by the absence of real vibrancy and life in the sound quality of digitalized re-releases.  I've read several explanations of why this happens---poor quality analog masters, hasty engineering, even partial deafness of recording engineers---but all that matters to me is that often the digital version fails to convey something fundamental in the original LP sound and all the great potential of modern stereo equipment is lost in a mishmash of noise that does disservice to the music and our modern technology.      Wonderfully, amazingly, Fripp's remastering of In the Court of the Crimson King not only avoids whatever failures dog many remasterings of 1960s music, his CD is a brilliant reimagining of that seminal progressive rock sound.  In this recording there is fidelity of sound quality (remember the idea of \\"high fidelity\\"?) as well as a fidelity to the original intent of the King Crimson style.  I got more than my money's worth hearing the soaring flute in \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" and the entire album, with all its eccentric musical explorations, maintains this high level of fidelity.  Highly recommended.  Turn it up!
0440418569|5.0|This book is excellent for young adult readers.  It is excellent for stimulating discussion and developing critical thinking.
B000XA5K48|2.0|This is really pretty awful.  It has some decent action sequences but the movie is marred by a blatant left wing agenda and some unnecessary gore.  Oh and the way he handles the baby in all of the shooting sequences is so stupid it's almost impossible to watch.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|Love this movie.  It's a fun, silly, family movie that all ages can enjoy.  I usually put our Christmas movies away until December, but this is one that I would keep out to watch when I need a chuckle. I highly recommend it.
B00001U0DP|5.0|\\"Life is Beautiful\\" is without doubt a wonderful film. At once we are reminded of the extremes of life - love and hatred, kindness and cruelty, laughter and sadness. Yet, through it all, \\"Life is Beautiful\\" for its optimism, courage and inner strength amidst adversity. Lessons that we as parents, as spouses and, above all else, as human beings should emulate.<br /><br />The film moves quickly thanks to Roberto Benigni's brilliant story, tightly woven script and slapstick humour. Indeed, at times I thought I was watching Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton or Harpo Marx in some scenes, i.e. the changing of hats, the horse in the restaurant, the umbrella dance, the runaway car, the exaggerated goosestep.<br /><br />As for the Miramax `Collector's Edition' DVD, it features various film trailers, an interview with Benigni nd his wife (Nicoletta Braschi) and an interactive menu with language options in Italian or English. I watched it in Italian with English subtitles, and although I don't speak the language, I found it relatively easy to follow.<br /><br />\\"Life is Beautiful\\" really pulls at the heartstrings.  You'll have a good laugh, a good cry. And you'll realise life is indeed beautiful!
B00005NIL9|5.0|I can not think of any other word to appropriately describe the emotion that fills every nook and cranny of this album.  Sure, sure, everyone talks about 'All Right Now,' but it gets old after a while, in fact, since I've gotten a hold of this album, I've never once listened to the last song just because in light of the first six tracks, the song just does not hold up and starts appearing like the weakest, make-for-mass-market song on the entire album.    The group will never be called virtuosos, and the songs are not particularly complex, however, the feeling put into each and every song makes them soar higher than any superfluous guitar or pointless drum solo.  Apart from the hit, the only cut that is even vaguely light-hearted and up-tempo is 'Remember,' and even here, the love that oozes from Paul Rodgers voice about times past with his fictional lady friend just brings trembles to my body.  If you ever need convinced about the one song that should have brought acclaim to this album, just listen to 'Mr. Big,' the anger in Mr. Rodgers voice, the screaming, powerful, and oh-so-emotional guitar solos from Paul Kossoff; and of course, the terrific, bass-player-come-unhinged Andy Fraser stomping through the instrumental section like no tomorrow.      If there was ever a case to show why emotion and spirit is more important in rock than showmanship, this album would probably have to be the poster-child, right along side Mountain's 'Climbing' or Ian Hunter's self-titled debut.    Also, don't listen to the other recommending to avoid the album itself for other greatest hits packages.  Perhaps avoiding this particular release of the album, because, as mentioned in other posts, the bonus tracks are completely useless.  No one wants to hear All Right Now without being cleaned up and recorded in what seems like a dumpster.  This album, along with probably every Free (and Bad Company) album is thoroughly recommended.  Paul Rodgers could never do wrong in my eyes (or ears?)
0375842209|5.0|The story is told by Death itself, it tells us how he picks up souls and he focus on a little girl. As you can imagine Deaths job during World War II must have been pretty busy.<br /><br />The little girl is introduced to us by Death when he goes and picks up a soul, his brothers soul who had just died in the train they were traveling with their mother. While on this occasion she manages to steal her first book. Then her mother disappears, and she is left in the care of foster parents. Then throughout the book horrible things happen such as Jews being transferred from one camp to another and going through the town she lives in, bombs hitting the town she lives in, etc. and for whatever reason all of this situations are related to reading and books and stealing.<br />The book brings up a lot of feelings specially at the end. I couldn't avoid the great sadness that the writer so well transfers to us the readers.<br />It is a mix of a History, Holocaust and Fantasy. Extremely well written.<br />I recommend it to all of those who love a good novel but like it to have strong emotions
1592289444|5.0|This book was published in 1956 and hard to believe that I hadn't heard of it before.  It is a quick read, maybe because it is so interesting & it is true.  It does leave you with a lot of questions of what happened back at the concentration camp when their escape was discovered, and  the lives of the other survivors.  I borrowed this book from a friend & then bought five copies - - loaned a copy out & each person who read it, bought at least one copy.
0440238609|3.0|I gave this series three stars because the first book was really pretty good.  There were compelling characters and a promising plot with, what's really fun for me, a really promising allegory to follow and try to figure out (and atheists don't bother me if they at least try to make reasoned arguments instead of screeds).  By book 2 things started to go downhill, however, and by book 3 I had the impression that the author was just cruising on the strength of his earlier successes.    For one thing, I'm all for suspending belief when I read sci-fi, but by book 3 it seemed like Pullman stopped even trying to weave a coherent plot.  People, angels and weird mechanical devices appear in the nick of time, and in exactly the right universe out of the infinity of possible universes.  Daemons inexplicably switch universes to appear exactly where they're needed.  Some ghosts fizzle away immediately upon seeing the light of day, while other ghosts live to fight for hours in the serie's final epic battle.  And so on....      OK, and I just can't stop myself from griping that the girl & women characters are generally manipulative and devious, whereas the male characters are invariably strong, noble, et cetera.  By the third book Will is making all the important decisions and doing all the strategical planning.  Lyra, who I liked so much in book one, is reduced in Book 3 to a role where she lies and manipulates constantly to get the pair out of scrapes, nurses Will when he's wounded, tenderly arranges his blankets even when he's well, and all the rest.  OK, I get it, Will represents \\"free will\\" and Lyra represents Eve.  But the main adults follow these same patterns.  While both parents abandoned Lyra as a child, Mrs. Coulter comes in for repeated flagellation (and self-flagellation) for choosing career over parenthood and generally being a bad parent.  Asriel does not -- How fair is this?    And while I'm open to allegorical tales of any stripe, this one started very promisingly and then just fizzled out (spoiler alert!).  It seems to boil down to this:  a fictional ex-nun sits in a Spanish restaurant, checks out a good-looking Italian scientist, decides that chastity and convent life don't work for her any more -- and then she somehow immediately \\"knows\\", sitting there in Spain, that God doesn't exist.  Seriously, there's not much more to it than that.  A fictional character's \\"feelings\\" are supposed to substitute for any type of rational argument, and the fact that she's an ex-nun is apparently supposed to lend this the moral weight that it wouldn't have on its own.  Instead, the religious allegory seems to depend mostly on the ham-handed literary convention of having all the religious figures do dastardly deeds, in place of any coherent arguments.  Yeah, there's also something about an old guy in a cloud mountain who evaporates, but the timing is all wrong relative to the original sin allegory and the episode in that nice Spanish cafe, and besides I don't know any religious people  beyond the age of 6 who still believe in bearded old guys.  Indeed most religious people I know (Christians and others too) are more comfortable with the idea of a sort of universal benevolent spirit ....     But wait! Isn't that sort of like people rejoining their daemons to live happily ever after in Pullman's afterworld that follows death, and the ghosts of Pullman's alternative cosmos, and whatever \\"concious\\" dust is supposed to be?  But somebody stop me now, because I know Pullman definitely, most certainly, doesn't want us to think this way!  Since it's clear that Pullman sees no ambiguity on these issues, I'll have to just go with the conclusion that it's bad writing and plotting.      So by the end I was just so confused, annoyed, and disappointed ....   Pullman is certainly entitled to his beliefs or non-beliefs, but he seems too lazy to try to convey them beyond using cardboard evil church characters.  Or to construct a coherent plot.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|this is a great film with fun music and performances. if your a fan of musicals you need to check it out.
B000002J2F|5.0|In purchasing this album (the new version with bonus dvd and surround sound mix), I was fully expecting dissapointment. All I could remember hearing from the album were its \\"pop\\" singles (more on that later), and I fully expected the album to have nary a \\"prog\\" song to be found. I then heard from more of the fanbase that its more of a crossover album in between the Prog and \\"Pop\\" worlds, but still wasn't expecting much.<br /><br />However, from the onset of \\"Behind the Lines\\" I knew something was up.<br /><br />It begins with a bombastic keyboard intro and then a crisp furious drum part from Phil Collins, followed by some very Hackett-like guitar lines from Mike Rutherford (something he didn't do so well on the previous album). The beginning of the song almost reminds one of something that would be written for an Olympics commerical or golf tournament in the mid-eighties, that is, its a bombastic intro intended to get the listeners attention, but more importantly STILL PROG. The song then settles down a little bit with a bit of a groove and more keyboard driven melodies and Collins' very emotional vocals.<br /><br />It then goes into a drum machine (!) beat that leads into the song \\"Duchess\\", which reminds me of some of the more straightforward songs from days passed, because its still quirky enough and synth driven to be similar to those songs (and don't fret over the drum machine, its only used as an effect on THIS SONG, and also sparingly, almost reminding one of the \\"lawnmower\\" sound on \\"I Know What I Like In Your Wardrobe\\".<br /><br />Duchess that evolves into \\"Guide Vocal\\", a very emotional, Gabriel-era type ballad, but far too short (as most fans know, these songs were intended as an album side long suite, but the rest of the songs (Turn it on Again and Duke's Travel's/Duke's End aren't until towards the end of the album).<br /><br />We then go to \\"Man of Our Times\\" which reminds me of some of the more \\"rocking\\" songs off the Lamb (or to some people of Mike's then current solo album) and then the \\"black sheep of the album\\", \\"Misunderstanding\\".<br /><br />Misunderstanding is a decent pop song, with a decent groove, but definitely interrupts the flow of the album. Its a solo Collins track (as evidenced by the interviews on the bonus dvd) and it shows. Now I used to dislike the song, but I've gotten so used to it, I don't mind it (as much as later singles like No Reply at All, etc). Its relatively harmless, if very un-\\"Genesis-like\\".<br /><br />\\"Heathaze\\" then returns us to the Wind and Wuthering era period a little bit, and does so successfully.<br /><br />\\"Turn it on again\\" is one of the most successful fusings of prog and pop other than Rush's \\"Subdivisions\\", it features no discerible chorus and the timing is 13/8, which gives it a weird twist (as well as its very unique melody, but I'll leave the stuffy music theory references at home this time).<br /><br />\\"Alone Tonight\\", though enjoyable, does qualify as album filler to a certain extent, though I enjoy it as it still texturally seems identifiable with the band. It kind of reminds me of some of the \\"And Then There Were Three...\\" period; laid back, atmospheric, but also very refined.<br /><br />\\"Cul De Sac\\" reminds me of a fusion of elements between \\"Wind\\" and the \\"..Three\\" album, but its enjoyable and epic enough to fit on the album.<br /><br />\\"Please Don't Ask\\" is considered another \\"Phil pop song\\" but his vocals and the riffs still remind me of the \\"Phil trying to ape Peter Gabriel\\" period ironically enough. The very straightforward lyrics referring to his then fresh divorce (Phil's) are kind of a detriment to the song though. Its a very emotional moment, if a little bit melodramatic.<br /><br />We then continue (finally!) the Duke suite with the \\"Los Endos\\" like Duke's Travel's/Duke's End..<br /><br />As a personal observation I would say that this album grew on me, and as soon as I was hooked it became one of my favorite Genesis albums.<br /><br />The album is very sincere, and still a very progressive album from the point of view of music, structure and content. I believe this album is their last stab at something truely progressive, as subsequent albums would contain more and more pop (and more and more filler).<br /><br />Its also a unique album, it has a buoyancy and energy that hadn't been seen with the band in their last two albums since \\"A Trick of the Tail\\".<br /><br />Overall, its not over the \\"pop\\" hump that later albums were, though its not as pastoral and progressive as previous material either.<br /><br />In fact, alot of prog reviewers have said it almost predicts the upcoming \\"Neo-Prog\\" movement in England (bands such as Marillion, Saga, etc) because it has a somewhat \\"pop/rock\\" sound mixed with the progressive rock edge that made those bands popular.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd agree with that, but we can all agree this is one of Genesis's most unique and enjoyable albums. The guitars rock, they keyboards take ahold, the drums and bass are all rock solid, and Phil has an energy that he hadn't had on vocals before.<br /><br />This, overall, is the best album of the \\"trio\\" period of Genesis.<br /><br />Update: 5/13/2008<br /><br />I would like to add to this review in saying that this album is Genesis's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", and \\"Black Album\\" all in one. It seethes with an energy that previous albums didn't have as much (don't get me wrong I love all Genesis), but also has the elements that made them one of rock's classic bands, and prog bands to boot.

B000001FQ4|5.0|Thin Lizzy - Night Life, 1974.    Probably more 4.5 stars than 5.    To start out, by looking at any of the reviews for this album and then subsequently reading reviews for the rest of the band's output, it will be immediately obvious that this album is quite different from all the rest.  This however, does not have to be a bad thing.  The subdued nature of the entire album helps to bring out a romantic quality that is not touched upon in other recordings.  Smooth, yet sensual, without being overly soft or cute; this is a record, that while it does certainly have its moments of intensity, is also one that a person who prefers to 'rock out' on occasion will not feel ashamed of listening to.      From the ever catchy lead-off track, 'She Knows', to the light funk of 'Night Life', to a healthy dose of swagger in 'It's Only Money', there's a bit of something offered up in each track to keep you interest going throughout.  It should also be noted that the interplay between the band is quite superb.  Everyone seems to mention the twin guitar attack that is self-evident, but there is also a very capable rhythm section to back the guitarists, courtesy of Phil Lynott and Brian Downey.      So if you're ever in the mood for the softer side of rock while avoiding the cheesy or sappy, and are already a fan of this band's more well-known records, I would not hesitate to give this one a shot.
0618680004|4.0|Scary, funny, informative, eye-opening and thrilling at times. But mostly scary.  Don't let the beginning put you off; Dawkins seems incredibly arrogant and narrow minded at times but in the end he shapes his story into a very elegant read. It's full of amazing facts and anecdotes like \\"the Cargo Cults\\" which in itself, makes the book worth reading.
B0002JJBZE|5.0|Perhaps the best season of the best show ever produced for television, season 2 offers some of the finest episodes of the entire series including: AMOK TIME, A PRIVATE LITTLE WAR, THE CHANGELING, THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE, WOLF IN THE FOLD among many others. A classic show for fans of intelligent television of any age.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Hi All,         I only just received my copy of Blade Runner (Five-Disc Complete Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray] today 1/15/08.I was totally blown away with this version on blu ray.I still own the VHS version (My door stopper)and the DVD version which i watch occasionally.I must say from the very first scene the PQ and SQ was superb! This is a must have if you are a fan of this movie.It will probably take me another week to go through the other four disc.           I'm from Australia,this title has yet to be release on Blu ray.Don't really know why? This title was due for realease last year in Australia on blu ray in November but then it was sad to hear the release date was \\"unknown\\".I just wish these big studio like WB would get their acts together and release titles like they say.    thank you  and Enjoy!!!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The disks are awesome.  Fantastic scenes and unbelieveable beauty, these DVDs are an education as well as amazing entertainment.  Thank you for the opportunity to own them, they will be passed down to the next two generations of our family.
B0000VD04M|5.0|Oh, he's just PLAYING a cross dresser. Yes, before he donned make-up and shivered our timbers, Johnny Depp played the infamous Ed Wood, the Worst Director Ever (though his films are undoubtedly entertaining), in frequent collaborator Tim Burton's 1993 biopic. The film is definitely one of both Burton's and Depp's best films, as both show great talent here and care for the subject matter.<br /> The film chronicles Wood's many adventures in Hollywood: meeting the incomparable Bela Lugosi (Martin Landau, who won a well-deserved Oscar), losing Girlfriend #1 Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) and getting Girlfriend #2 Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), and of course struggling to get his films made, like GLEN OR GLENDA? (about a struggle with transvestism and sex changes, which is greeted with laughter by its hopeful releaser, thinking it to be a practical joke), BRIDE OF THE MONSTER (originally BRIDE OF THE ATOM, and a film which took many years to make due to budget issues), and of course PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE (considered by many to be the worst film ever made... and probably the most entertaining bad movie ever). The film also shows Ed's many relationships with his frequent cast members like Lugosi, the girlfriends, Tor Johnson (George 'The Animal' Steele), Vampira (Lisa Marie), Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), and probably my favorite character, Bunny Breckinridge (a fabulous Bill Murray), who attempts a sex change in Mexico and ends up with a dead gay lover. In the end, we care for Ed and really admire his undying devotion to his films and friends, and we realize that he can't really be the worst director ever if he has that much imagination and spunk (hear that, Michael Bay?).<br /> The film really has an affection for everyone, and it is that ongoing sense of lightheartedness that makes the film work so much. Of course, it is tragic to see poor Bela dying of a morphine addiction (Landau again earns his Oscar here), but even that doesn't take away from the general fun of watching the movie.ching the movie.
6302637899|5.0|This review is for the 1992 reissue of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on VHS:<br /><br />This edition features an edited special edition released 2 years earlier.<br />It contains the new Stereo Mix of the US version of the film and an edited part of the Intro from Richard O'Brian. You can find the full 5 minute documentary intro and Time Warp music video on the 1990 15th Anniversary Edition.<br /><br />This is perhaps the most easily accessable and easily found VHS copy of the movie.
0440238609|4.0|I first saw the Golden Compass movie which got me interested in the fantasy universe of His Dark Materials. I certainly enjoyed the movie, but the Golden Compass book really hooked me. Lyra's adventure is full of momorable characters, and the pace never lets up. I found it terribly hard to put the book down. And this was the case for books two and three as well.<br /><br />While the worlds and people and \\"people\\" of Lyra's journey are all amazing, I can't say that I enjoyed the deeper meaning of the story as much as I did the pure adventure aspects. The long revealing of Lyra's fate is intense, and I was deparately curious to finally see it all played out. But, I honestly don't think the author wrapped it up that well. What seemed so logically elaborated and tightly constructed felt rushed and frayed by the conclusion. Key secrets were never explained, and the finale felt forced, presumably to invoke a particular emotional response in the reader. The ending I was anticipating would have been not only more enjoyable, but more natural and better fitted to the rest of story.<br /><br />Regardless, His Dark Materials was a great ride that I would recommend to anyone.
B000062XFG|5.0|The set arrived sooner than I thought it would. Which always puts a big smile on a buyer's face.  It was in great condition.  It appeared new.  All of the disks worked with out any skips, etc.  My husband loves Star Trek and needs to finish his collection. I will certainly shop with the same buyer for future purchases.
0634022296|5.0|Excellent, accurate chords and lyrics.    Great price too.    Sure, there are no fingerpicking guidelines as Moley noted, but what do you expect for the price. Given the accuracy of the chords, and the keys in which the songs were played, it is very easy to use this book in combination with the actual song recordings, to work out the picking on all the goodies!  A lot of the songs don't require picking anyway.  Part of the fun of playing these acoustically is to work out your own arrangements of the sometimes multiple guitar parts.      This book also serves as a great 'instuction manual' for barre chords!  No better way to learn them than in the context of these tunes!    If you want full picking / band arrangements, drop $$$$$ on that book (it's on amazon, forget the title now). But, this is excellent for the price and gets even better if you put a little time into listening to the songs at the sametime.
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|Do your self a favor and get this album before Britney is committed or follows in Anna Nicole's footsteps (God forbid)...  If you can remember the feeling that you had when you heard Madonna's very first album....then you will love Blackout..  It is a constant ride of fun and all out frivalty...one song sexier than the next.....one song making you want to make love and the next making you hate your significant other...  Piece of Me is a really significant release for Britney in that you can really see where it's the truth and how the Paparazzi and everyone around her are leading to her ultimate demise...  So sad....  Can't quite say that I love this more than the Toxic album.....but it's catching up quickly the more that I listen to it...  Buy it....you won't be disappointed....
B00005JPTI|4.0|I'm not much of a Will Smith fan anymore, but when I saw the previews for &#34;I Am Legend&#34; in the movie theater, this was a concept I had to see. Something about a man standing alone in a terrorized, deserted city had me. The computer effects of this film in regards to re-creating New York City is fantastic. I have also read that they actually shut down and closed off street locations for re-dressing and filming, for example, adding the grass and abandoned cars.   This film reflects The Last Man on Earth (1964), starring Vincent Price, The Omega Man (1971) starring Charlton Heston and every other zombie movie and video game we have ever played. This film also made me think of Logan's Run.   &#34;Robert Neville&#34; (Will Smith) is the last human man alive in New York City in 2009. It is just him and his dog, Sam.  The city is totally deserted due to a virus and human warfare. The city has not been maintained, so of course, remains of the mayhem still exist and grass and weeds have overtaken some roads. Deer also run freely with a lion also on the loose. These zoo animals are only seen in the daytime. Robert is safe in the daytime and has the entire city to drive in for himself. As long as he stays outside in the sun or inside his own apartment, him and his dog are fine. However, when nighttime falls, it is dangerous for Robert. Find out why.   This film was only good enough to see once.  Unless the DVD version has bonus footage within the film and an alternate ending, I most likely will not see it again.   Can a dog get an Academy Award nomination?    You can watch Cloverfield (2008) and then, I Am Legend (2007), followed by The History Channel's &#34;Life After People&#34; (2008-tv) for a wonderful epic for yourself.
B00011F5DK|5.0|After reading many reviews of this game, I bought it for Christmas for our family this year.  We are addicted!  Even our 5-year-old and 7-year-old can play and challenge us.  Highly recommended and the fact that you can play a game quickly anytime is another plus!

B000VWYJ86|4.0|The consensus opinion of this movie is that it is an excellent action film, and in the main I think this is very true--with two caveats.  1) The \\"Bourne Identity\\" grounded its story and action with a sense of real human beings caught up in a growing crisis: Damon's Bourne and Franka Potente's Marie.  The action slows down, they talk, they grow together, we--more and more--care about them.  This adds a vital dimension to the exciting action scenes.  Paul Greengrass directs the two sequels, and sacrifices the human dimension for simply more action, faster action, hyped up action.  You can only go so far in this direction without snapping all credibility, and moving into the realm of the unintended comic.  Matt Damon is very good in the first movie, but he could almost be replaced in the sequels with a computer graphic, as his acting ability, and ability to convey an inner dimension, is so little used (we only care about him at all because our sense of him is carried over from Doug Liman's first film).<br /><br />2)  Many viewers have complained about the use of the \\"Shakey Cam\\" in the Greengrass sequels (particularly in \\"Ultimatum,\\"), but this is not really identifying the problem.  The camera does move almost all the time in \\"Ultimatum,\\" and frequently vibrates, oscillates, jiggles as it moves, etc.  But this would be ok--and sometimes even exciting--if the audience could nevertheless see what is going on: the total arc of a given action, with an environmental context clearly established and maintained throughout the action.  This is what we need to see and instinctively follow if our empathetic involvement is to be fully engaged.  It is dramatic action--human action- -that is exciting, not the action of the camera recording the human action.  And it is not the \\"shakiness\\" that is the primary problem, but the hyper cutting that goes on within a scene, so that we lose context and perspective, and are given instead vast fast flurries of hyper-kinetic fragments of scenes that are machine-gunned at us throughout almost all the entire film.<br /><br />But even with what I think are these significant flaws, the film does generate lots of excitement and a real sense of the continuation of a kind of urgent, mythic journey.  I think it is a good movie that would have been brilliant if only we could be involved more in it, and see more of it!are machine-gunned at us throughout almost all the entire film.

B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver has one of the nicest Album covers and that's not all. It also carries two of John and Paul's greatest songs. I'm Only Sleeping and Eleanor Rigby.<br />It still sounds vibrant and vital more then 40 years after production.

B000Y7U98C|3.0|When I saw the previews to this movie I just had to have it.  I am a Sci-Fi fanatic, and it has been quite some time since I have seen a great Sci-Fi movie!  Unfotunately that is still the case.<br /><br />The whole story about our sun dying is quite intriguing.  The movie gets a pretty strong start, even though it lacks any sort of prelude.  It simply starts with a picture of the sun and an actor saying \\"Our sun is dying.\\"  A high tech ship flying straight toward the sun, with a somewhat skilled crew of only moderate acting abilities.  Their ship, the second launched by earth in an attempt to save our sun, contains a payload which holds our last chance at saving mankind.  The first ship had failed its mission and it is assumed that the ship and all crew are lost.  The remainder of the film is filled with unfortunate yet somewhat predictable events.  I didn't mind that the movie lacked the mystery and suspense that I had hoped for, but the special effects were extremely dissapointing.  What is a Sci-Fi film without stunning special effects?  One that will collect dust for years in the very back of my DVD cabinet.<br /><br />I am not sorry that I watched this film.  It is certainly worth a watch.  I just wish that I had rented it, as I will likely never watch it again.  I cannot recommend this DVD for purchase, but I do recommend renting the movie and watching it, if you are a die hard Sci-Fi fan.  If you enjoy a great Sci-Fi space thriller then you will surely enjoy the film, but I think you will agree, once finished, that it is definately rental material.  I hope you enjoy the movie.<br /><br />P.S.  If you ever saw the movie \\"Solar Crisis\\", released sometime in the early 90s, then you will definately see strong similarities in this movie \\"Sunshine.\\"
B000VWE5OY|2.0|At first, I didn't quite like this series.  Then, after viewing it, I really didn't like this series.<br /><br />The characters - from Gwen to Cap'n Jack - are so unreliable and so obsessed with falling in love or bedding one another (or regretting falling in love and/or bedding one another) that the entire series would only be believable if it was set in a small town coffee shop and its characters were over-stimulated 20somethings with nothing other to do than lie (either about themselves or with their co-workers).<br /><br />As for the alien threats, you have to stick around for the majority of the series until you hit an episode with a fear-inspiring foe and an emotionally-packed ride.
B00005ASHM|5.0|The making of Pet Sounds alone has been one of the most fascinating pop stories. Brian Wilson writing and producing all the songs while the band was on tour. Brian bringing in a new text writer. And disregarding his successful collaboration with Beach Boy member and lyricist Mike love.<br />The album wasn't even as big a hit as many record company executives must have hopen for.<br />But more then 40 years down the road Pet Sounds still ranks in my personal top 5 best albums of all time. Why. Because of the beautiful melodies and ditto lyrics. The orchestration where the guitar no longer played an important part. Because of the fabulous harmonies. Because of the theme of 'growing up' which can be found in most songs. This is definitely a must have album.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I heard a number of things about Brandi Carlile, as well as this album, for quite some time before I actually heard it.  To be quite honest, I was very suprised by how incredible this record turned out to be.  It's one of those albums that most people in the indie rock crowd will have a a hard time admitting that they actually like, simply because it's not really that \\"cool\\", but it's damn good.      The vocals on this record are raw and honest, and that stands as the most captivating element of The Story.  Her lyrics are compelling, yet it's the way she sings her songs that really captivated me.  It's actually the first time that I've been completely enthralled by someone's voice since I've heard Neko Case sing for the first time (which says a great deal, considering that I am a huge fan of Neko).  I also enjoy the fact that there's not much of a genre that you can slap on Brandi Carlile, and she doesn't care at all.  At times, the music is country, others it's folky, and overall, it's pretty rockin'.  It's one of the few albums that I have fully enjoyed this past year, and I still can't stop listening to it.    Sure, it's not fashionable, but music isn't about picking out a colored v-neck from American Apparel, and Brandi Carlile proves that.  She's made a truly timeless album here, and I will enjoy it for years to come.

B000ICL3KG|1.0|The problem with this documentary (if you can really call it that) is that gives fuel to the \\"there is no global warming' thinking people.  After all this is the same nut that said he made the internet.  This is not the voice of an a environmentalist.  Unlike Jimmy Carter you will not find him getting his hands dirty for his own cause.  I just have a hard time imagining this guy planting a tree.<br /><br />Considering his eco actions, his work is like a chain smoker telling a casual smoker they should stop smoking for fear of the chain smoker getting second hand smoke.  Al Gore claims to be an environmentalist.  But yet he won an award in regards to this documentary.  What does he do?  Well he takes a jet after the award ceremony to a big party which has dead animals flown in from separate parts of the world for people to eat.  Never mind that he could had festivities entirely prepared from a local renewable organic farms near by.  I am willing to bet he does not live a green life style after the making of this documentary.  The man could easily afford a solar / wind generating system that could keep his houses operational.<br /><br />If anything it seems he made this because he was not in the spot light as much as he wanted to be.  Plus he wanted to bitch to everyone about not winning the election.  So he thought up this documentary as the environment was a hot button topic to launch a `Look at Al Gore'.  After watching him go on about losing the election and his childhood I really could not watch it very long.  In part because I was afraid they would reshow the worst snore fest of all presidential debates (Gore the bore versus Bush the slow witted dimwit).<br /><br />Perhaps the most amusing part of the DVD involved a short cut from Futurama on the cause of global warming.<br /><br />My advice, don't waste your money on this DVD, go plant a tree instead.  Don't give this hypocrite a dime.<br /><br />I recommend reading:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000V639NI Forest & the Sea a Study of the Economy]]<br /><br />This is what motivated me to be more environmentally friendly.<br /><br />As for you nut balls that say there is no such thing as global warming.  Your nuts if you don't think what you do in life does not impact the planet.  The simplest of physics makes it very clear.  For every action there is an opposite and equal reaction.

0060507772|5.0|As much as I love Terry Pratchett's work, Paul Kidby's art is the reason why I keep coming back to this book again and again.

B000WC2URM|1.0|If you like your \\"Nutcracker\\" for the one half dark, ugly and populated by grotesque, unsympathetic and perverse characters, and for the second looking like Disney gone haywire, then this is the DVD for you. Forget about the candy, the lemonade fountains, the good fairies and pink child fantasies, this is Konfiturenburg as you wouldn't have dared to dream it in your worst nightmare. The brainchild of Mariinsky Theatre director Valery Gergiev who conducts the score and eccentric artist Mikhail Shemyakin who created the designs and about everything else, this new \\"Nutcracker\\" resembles more a frantic attempt to be modern and different than it is proof of genuine innovative inspiration and artistic vision. What is painfully lacking in this production is a choreography of any distinction. Dance maker Kirill Simonov's effort is embarrassingly weak, moreover unrelated with Tchaikovsky's score and totally subservient to the parade of quirky designs unleashed by Shemyakin.     Filmed live at the Mariinsky Theatre in early 2007, Masha as portrayed by doll-like Irina Golub goggles herself through the ballet, coiling, jerking and falling in an anthology of poorly crafted movements; the hapless Nutcracker has to wear a mask until the last fifteen minutes of the ballet - it turns out to be Leonid Sarafanov, a splendid dancer who is wasted like anybody else. Simonov's defining moment must be the Waltz of the Snowflakes in which the Mariinsky corps de ballet girls clad in black end up lying on their backs and crawling on all fours, before being send home by a Nosferatu-like Drosselmayer. Everything is delivered with the subtleness of a sledgehammer, albeit naïve souls will argue that all is done with irony and wit. Sure, but why is nobody laughing then?
0618918248|5.0|Every school in the free world should make Richard Dawkin's book become part of their curriculum. Every religious organization should open their eyes to Dawkins prose which he so delicously spills out in thought provoking ease and unescapable truths. Every clergy should read this, every agnostic, every jew, everyone involved in the brutal world of Islam. Every social worker should read this, every rehab counselor, every one of those pompous, cretin like guidance counselors and elitist corporate titans.<br /><br />I have bought this book ten times ten to share with everyone from my childhood priest, to the kids that I mentor. My own children will read this, so they themselves can decide what is the truth or what is science fiction. Perhaps this book, above almost all others, is the most important work of writing in the past twenty or thirty years, and its accolades are deserved and warranted.<br /><br />I wish in my teenage years a book of this magnitude and voice was available for youth who were brainwashed from jumpstreet by ignorant parents and the like; these youth never being able to question what they were born into and why things had to be a certain way, because the good book said so.<br /><br />In closing, I would like to quote one passage in which Dawkins has guided me into believing, quite reasonably, why he is one of the most important people on the planet. His book could bring peace, hope, ambition and understanding to a world that is blinded by intolerant religious fanatics and mass hatred.<br /><br />\\"Admittedly, people of a theological bent are often chronically incapable of distinguishing what is true from what they'd like to be true.

Or, if you dont like that, invent a seperate evil god, call him Satan, and blame his cosmic battle against the good god for the evil in the world.

B000Y7U98C|1.0|The first hour or so was actually fine -- boring parts, good parts, etc. Your basic Save the Earth cliche, but cleverly done, I thought. However, an hour and 15 minutes or so into the film, it turns into yet another yawning edition of How Many Ways Can We Kill Off the Cast.  Don't waste your money. Wait until it comes to a public library and borrow it for free. It's not worth the three or four buck rental fee.

B0000067L3|4.0|Cream's best album combines studio and live material so you get the best of both.  There are lots of reviews here and at allmusic and other places, I'm sure, that will go into detail about just what makes this album great.  When I review something here, I am usually inclined to discuss the sound quality of particular classic rock releases in their various incarnations.<br /><br />This is another case of the label's remaster actually sounding worse than the original release.  It's got too much boost in the mid-frequency spectrum which causes a distinct lack of clarity on vocals and other details.  In terms of loudness and compression, this one actually does a good job not brick walling everything to make it distorted like so many remasters tend to do.  So, you have the good and the bad...but you can always choose to have only the good....<br /><br />How, you say?  First, if you can afford it, go for a used copy of the DCC gold disc version of this mastered by Steve Hoffman.  It is the best version of this album on CD, period.  The gold disc part really has nothing to do with that...it's the excellent and meticulous mastering by Mr. Hoffman that makes this shine.  However, you'll pay well over $50 for one of these.<br /><br />Your second choice would be a used copy of the original release on Polydor (amazon lists this as the 1990 version).  This was done by Dennis Drake and sounds really good, too, and you can find it here in the marketplace for under $15 (just make sure to ask the seller if it's the original release in the wide or fatboy case with the silver discs).  If you don't believe me, buy one of each and have your own shootout and find out for yourself.

B000OLGCHA|4.0|After listening to some disappointing soundtracks from the Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the dreadful Goblet of Fire soundtrack, it was quite refreshing to listen to and finally hear this soundtrack. As we listened to each selection, we were able to visualize the scene in the movie that it portrayed. In fact, this soundtrack enhanced the movie and created the mood of the scene at hand.<br /><br />My only two suggestions would have been to rearrange the selections in chronological order and to have made Umbridge's theme just a little more wicked and dark.<br /><br />I hope that Nicholas Hooper's next soundtrack for Half Blood Prince is just as invigorating.
B000VNMMQQ|4.0|Like most men, I have placed the original Die Hard movie at the pinnacle of macho-action films.  What made Die Hard so great wasn't just that it was an action movie, but that it was an old-fashioned tale of cops-and-robbers juiced with testosterone and lots of explosions.  John McClane (Bruce Willis) was an ordinary cop thrust into an extraordinary situation, an American-grown defender of justice given the opportunity to strike back against international invaders.  Or so it seemed; the joke was on us.  The original villain was actually just a petty thief, using the tactics of terrorists to cover his operations.  It was a stroke of genius and prescient insight into how the world really works.<br /><br />Part and parcel of McClane's \\"normal guy\\"-ness was his ability to withstand pain and keep functioning.  And for that to happen, McClane had to get beat up, stabbed, burned, and otherwise bloodied. McClane was cool in an old-school way; with his stubble, his mumbled asides, and his often-bewildered expressions, he was a fantasized version of every teenage boy (and adult) who didn't have leading man good looks or huge muscles. And he always had a personal stake; McClane was our National Guardsman, protecting his family from crime.<br /><br />As they say, the more things change, the more they stay the same, and so we're back to Die Hard once more.  This has to be the first action movie explicitly based on an article, John Carlin's 1997 \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" for Wired magazine.  Basically, the article details a \\"fire sale\\" - an attack that postulates the next major terrorist attack on America will include an electronic element, combining an electronic attack on the nation's infrastructure with a brute force physical attack.<br /><br />Into this mix is our pal John, escorting Matt Farrell (Justin Long, AKA the \\"Mac Guy\\") to a government safe house.  It turns out all the hackers who helped develop the codes to infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure are being eliminated, and Farrell is the only one to have escaped.  Thus ensues a new breed of buddy movie, \\"Boomer Meets Gen Y,\\" and all the hilarity that entails.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard is as much about the consequences of cybeterrorism as it is about the differences in generations.  The dialogue between Farrell and McClane centers around these differences in understanding and accepting technology, and what it means to be a hero.  In the end, they discover they have a lot to learn from each other (awwww).<br /><br />The movie is not without its flaws.  The PG-13 editing is very noticeable; Willis resorts to grunting and groaning instead of swearing like he did in the earlier films.  He moans and groans so loudly that it starts to get comical.  There is not one but two unbelievable battles with aircraft that strain credulity, even for a Die Hard movie; I was willing to forgive Car vs. Helicopter, but Eighteen-Wheeler vs. VTOL Jet was just ludicrous.  VTOL jets are for taking off and landing, not having old-fashioned showdowns on bridges.  And yet, the special effects are so amazing that it's hard to nitpick.<br /><br />The other problem is the villain, Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant).  His disturbing actions are far more cutthroat and scary than his physical presence on screen.  As an actor, Olyphant just can't pull it off.  By the time McClane reaches him, you just want him to slap the kid upside the head and pull the plug on his computer. And of course, Gabriel's motives are no more noble than the villain from the first movie.<br /><br />In theory, there's a subplot about McClane's daughter, Lucy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), but she doesn't have much to do here other than be a hostage.  On the other hand, there's the addition of Kevin Smith as Warlock, a superhacker, that's just hilarious.  To people who care about Star Wars and Kevin Smith, anyway.<br /><br />Live Free or Die Hard tries to have it both ways, appealing to the younger (PG-13 movie release) and older generations (unrated DVD version) and engaging them in a debate about what it is to be a hero. As a believable tale of one man saving the nation, it's often overshadowed by its big-budget special effects. As an action movie, it's a worthy entry in the Die Hard franchise.is to be a hero.

B000EHSVQE|5.0|I'm only reviewing this because I clicked through 2-3 pages of reviews here, and found a dozen 1-star reviews.  I was amazed to read of people that made it 35 minutes through the movie before turning it off out of utter horror/boredom/disdain.    Many of them essentially said \\"how can anyone like a movie where we're supposed to laugh at stupid boring losers\\".  I guess that's the difference between loving and hating this film.  Napoleon is just a goofy guy who doesn't fit in with everyone.  I don't understand how that makes him a loser.  He doesn't want to come off as another boring high-schooler, so he brags about having bow hunting skills, hunting wolverines with a 12-gauge, and having a girlfriend who models in another state, but by the end of the movie he's dancing in front of the school, riding a horse, and just having a good time.      Other than being hilarious, the movie is surprisingly tender.  Napoleon is loyal to Pedro, to his brother, and even ultimately to his Uncle.  Other moments:  When Pedro wants to impress a girl, he builds her a cake and leaves it by her door.  Napoleon wants to do the same, so he draws her a picture.  When Pedro is sick, Napoleon calls his place to see if he's okay.  Pedro's cousins give Napoleon and his date a ride to the dance.  Deb nervously tries to talk to Napoleon waiting outside of the school for a ride.  Kip somehow finds true love.  Napoleon sees Uncle Rico's true sadness, and when he sees Pedro at the height of his despair, he takes to the stage on Pedro's behalf.    And if you disagree with this, your mom goes to college.
B000YIXBVI|3.0|I'M A HUGE RADIOHEAD FAN! That being said, this album, other than the first two tracks, and jigsaw track towards end, are very mellow. Bodysnatchers is my favorite track on album. THOM YORKE said a few years ago, the band would be barely recognizable in the future. He was right. I really liked direction of Hail to the thief, which is my favorite without a doubt. New comers to the Radiohead fold, I'd recommend O.k Computer next or The Bends to them. Note, some Radiohead albums take a few listens, they grow on you. Back to In Rainbows. I've deliberately weened myself on it gradually. To let it grow on me. It is agreat album. It just doesn't change gears alot, which isn't abad thing. I guess after HTTT album I wasn't sure what to expect. Great acoustic album. Easy to listen to. Can see why it will grab new fans, and keep older fans.Can't wait to see them in concert. House of Cards has been in my head a lot lately,great song. Get album, see for yourself.
B000AARKOO|2.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a snuff film made for Moslems, which our jihadist enemies must watch with delight to see the best of our White, Christian men roll around for 2 hours in self-degradation until they're finally slaughtered by the forces of Allah. Al-Quaida must find infinitely more pleasure and propaganda value in Ridley Scott's movie than they do in their own crude beheading videos, since it was the White man himself who wrote, directed, produced, starred in, and mass-distributed this slick and entertaining piece of self-flagellation and Islamic apologia. While the internet executions of a Daniel Pearl or Paul Johnson only serve to intimidate the already-timorous, and have the unintended effect of only steeling the resolve of militant Islam's enemies, the \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is a far more pernicious work of propaganda because it was made by our own people and thus undermines our will to survive far more than all the atrocities the barbarians can throw at us. A man will bear the blows of a thousand enemies but fall to the treachery of one friend, and when our own leading cultural voices celebrate our destruction, trash our heroes and spit on our Faith, it would not be surprising if we too as a nation fell, with \\"Et tu Brute\\" on our lips, murdered by corruption from within- from the top- a victim of the ultimate \\"Trahison des Clercs.\\"<br /><br />In a healthy society, a movie trumpeting the moral superiority of our mortal enemies would not be made at all, and certainly not while our men were tramping the hills of Afghanistan to avenge the dead of 9/11. One major newspaper critic quite correctly wrote that \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" was \\"Osama bin Laden's version of the Crusades.\\"  What must our jihadist enemies think when they watch this movie? \\"See? Even the kaffirs themselves depict their Crusaders as ignorant, adulterous, corrupt, war-mongering barbarians. And see how even they think the religion of the West is a weak, ignoble counterfeit that no one of intelligence believes in? See? The White man is rotten to the core. See? The Christian has an empty soul. See? The West is ripe for the picking, so let us take it.\\" Because this movie was so well-made and visually appealing, I lament all the more its despicable self-abasement. What grates even more was the extreme distortions of history necessary to achieve such a malevolent depiction of one of Western man's most glorious episodes. Not too long ago, most of our people would thrill to the names of men like Godfrey de Bouillon, Bohemund, Baldwin, Richard the Lionheart, and all the other flowers of nobility who risked everything they had in this world to deliver our holy places from desecration and our fellow Christians from Moslem tyranny. But now, morally diseased men like Scott and Monaghan pervert our history to tell us that the Crusades were nothing but a greedy land-grab and its holy warriors only thieves and murderers. And our people lap up this poison with voracity.<br /><br />Ridley Scott, William Monaghan and all the other decadent, deracinated minds who dreamt up this story are such traitors as kill civilizations, and ours will continue to decline and surrender and die so long as our enemies' most effective propagandists are tolerated within our own camp. Such people need to be recognized as the deadly cancers they are and effectually extirpated from all positions of influence in our society, before they further sap our morale, pride and will to exist.  Peoples that embrace the cringing materialism and multicultural relativism of this movie end up exterminated. God willing, we will reject this movie's ethos of suicide, and rediscover the life force that planted the banner of Christ over the ramparts of Jerusalem. It was a beautiful dream 900 years ago and still is today.in? See? The White man is rotten to the core. See? The Christian has an empty soul. See?

B0000019PA|5.0|This album is all of humanity bottled into a shot of light through your ears. It makes me cry, it has made me happy, and it has changed the way I see people. I thank you, Jeff Magnum, even though this album took everything and anything you had to say. You gave me, and everyone else who has written reviews about Aeroplane, a reason to think we're not alone.
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|A wonderful performance of Phantom, stunningly rendered in high definition. Unforgettable sets and hauntingly beautiful singing and acting make this a must-have Blu Ray treat. Anyone with an ear for music will love this performance! And the visual impact is fantastic also!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This yet another must have for all Coldplay fans. The songs range from slow to fast paced and are an excellent addition to the Coldplay repertoire. If you don't have this yet go out and buy it. A great addition and an album full of various hits.
0670034711|1.0|After hearing 'the buzz' on this book, it sounded right up my alley - my favorite genre of writing is food, with travel a close second, and the idea of reading of a personal journey toward spiritual growth seemed a great way to begin the new year. Well, it is a great way to start the new year - just not with this book.  Right from the get-go, I was struck with Ms. Gilbert's selfishness and self-absorption, glaringly evident in the handling of her marriage and life, in her 'me, me me, poor little me' tone. In her writing, this quality does not diminish throughout her journey; conversely, it gets stronger with every page, ad nauseum.   If your stomach is strong enough for a dose of flagrant self-aggrandizement, buy this book and a roll of Tums. If not - don't bother.
B0000508U6|5.0|Coldplay delivers yet another hit album. Parachutes delivers on the growing quality of Coldplay repertoire. You won't be disappointed with picking this up, especially if you are already aware with what Coldplay did with their full album debut.
0143038419|5.0|well written book.  i am enjoying reading it.  i feel like i am there with elizabeth gilgert on her journey.  i recommend it for anyone who wants to travel with someone vicariously.  she is just a good writer, quite personal.
B000Z0OX9O|5.0|Always have been a fan of the moody Blade Runner music. I was actually content with the previous release of this CD, but having the rest of the Bladerunner tracks is rather nice.     The new pieces composed by Vangelis are pretty good as well.
B000E6UWE4|2.0|I purchased this book based on all of the positive reviews here, and after having completed it, I am baffled as to the praise this book as gathered.<br /><br />I kept feeling like I was reading the 2nd book in a series, as the author skips any attempt at a back story of the characters, the land, the wars, the gods - everything. The book reads like a bunch of scattered ideas all thrown together - loosely. It's hard to decide what to even consider the major plot points, but whichever you choose you will find they don't resolve to any satisfaction.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book, but I just couldn't.
B000K15VSA|5.0|Alternate versions of the movie, hours of documentary and commentaries, deleted scenes...what more can I ask for. It's obvious that lots of care and professionalism went into every aspect.
B000GIXIBY|5.0|Better alternate ending than in the other [european (both)] versions. It even was HD. If you like the \\"story\\" and get this cheap, why not?    Movie is fun and it is about Bruce Campbell who kills the army of darkness, so anything is possible and everything that will be possible, will be good, I promise. Like THAT's worth something....
B0001LJC2K|5.0|You know, honestly, I gotta say...  I'm not sure where people are getting the \\"This sounds exactly like an imitation of Radiohead\\" crap.  Ok, yes, Matthew Bellamy's vocal has some allusions to Thom Yorke's sound.  I own The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A, and Hail to the Thief, and NOTHING on those albums even remotely resemble anything on Absolution.  It is blatantly obvious that a majority of the detractors heard from their friends, or other various hearsay that Muse were a blatant rip-off of Radiohead.  Then they listened to like three songs, and decided to say the same thing.      As far as I'm concerned, Muse's sound is completely original, more approachable than Radiohead, cleaner, less annoying, and CATCHY.  God... Apocalypse Please, Time is Running Out, Sing For Absolution, Stockholm Syndrome, Falling Away With You, Hysteria, Butterflies & Hurricanes, The Final Print, and especially Thoughts Of a Dying Atheist...  THEY SOUND NOTHING LIKE RADIOHEAD.  Not only that, they are absolutely fantastic songs.  And they call sound different from one another each offering a different greatness, from the non-mainstream drumming in Apocalypse Please, to the great beat and riff synchronization in the 2nd verse of Time is Running Out, to the epic singing choral section in Sing For Absolution, to the passion of Falling Away With You, to the In Your Face guitar work in Stockholm Syndrome (which, I may add, is probably one of the most original songs I've heard in a very long time), and finally the greatness of Hysteria and Butterflies, and Atheist.      This is what I ask of anybody with a free ear and an open mind when it comes to music.  Ignore the pleas from the ignorant people senselessly stating that Muse is a Radiohead rip-off.  While there are some distant similarities, Muse is completely their own band, and worlds far and away better than what Radiohead could ever be.  Buy this album, give it a chance, and I guarantee you won't be disappointed.    4.9/5 (sorry only Dream Theater's Scenes From a Memory gets a 5/5)
B000YENUIQ|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies of 2007.  I look forward to anything David Cronenberg does, being a big fan of his horror films since the 80's.  Although his last film with Viggo Mortensen, A History of Violence disappointed me, this is one of his masterworks.  The story revolves around a Russian mob family living in London, and the inner workings and betrayals of that family.  Mortensen makes this movie, playing such a bastard that you can't help but hate him through most of the film.  The coldness with which he portrays a Russian mobster is chilling, and his exterior and character portrayal are flawless.  There is an excellent supporting cast as well, including Naomi Watts as the midwife caught up in the underworld she knows nothing about.  I won't give away the ending, but there is a huge twist I had no idea was coming, that makes me appreicate this director's genius.  If you like dark thrillers, definitely go see this film, and it has something *ahem* extra in it for the ladies as well.  A work of art, to be sure.      Technical Note: This is one of the best HD transfers I've seen since the format launch.  Usually on my 60\\" HDTV, only special effects heavy movies display that 3D quality HD is known for, however on this disc the backgrounds separate remarkably from the foreground characters.  Scenes as simple as Naomi riding her motorbike down the street look like she's coming right at you, and there is not a hint of grain to be had in the entire film.  Highly recommended.
B000005RU2|5.0|Deep Purple is the best band of all times...Why Made in Japan is considered the best live album ever made? Because The Purples are the Best, the best Zep or Sabbath song's haven't the level of this tracks...  Ritchie, John, Roger and Ians are the maximum....
B0007CNXUU|5.0|In the past 18 months, our family lost 4 members. This movie handles a difficult subject with warmth, honesty & insight. It is also an interesting portrayal of a beloved author's life. I highly recommend Finding Neverland.
0596009208|5.0|Head First Java helps to establish a better understanding between the reader and the material. I had already completed an Intro to Computer Science course that was based in Java, and I felt that this book helped me to have a better understanding of the material. I would not recommend however, to read solely this book without a classic Java textbook, because I don't believe it goes in depth enough.    Overall: Great Supplement to Reinforce the Material
1577314808|5.0|The most amazing thing about this book is its clarity - it's the most lucid account of the workings of the human mind that I have ever come across. Like no other book I've read, it has an enlightening effect as you read it - you can feel yourself gaining greater clarity and insight. Another book which goes very well with it is the Fall by Steve Taylor, recommended on Eckhart's website. [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]]  This book Fall provides a historical and cultural context for Eckhart's book. It shows the ego's terrible effects throughout history and suggests that, as a species, we are now transcending it.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I seen this movie many moons ago and have always been very fond of it. I bought it on VHS several years ago and recently replaced the VHS with DVD. I'm not much of a movie collector, have maybe 30 in my collection, but this one was a must!    I feel this movie is very different from WOZ...it's much less corny/cheesy and more 'dark'. Dorothy escapes from a mental hospital and ends up back in OZ which is in disarray. Dorothy needs to save OZ from the evil witch/queen that has several different identities (heads...LOL). I wouldn't let a young child watch this, might be a little to scary for them.    Anyway, I recommend this movie to any OZ or Fairuza Balk fan....well worth buying for your collection. Very interesting movie!    Andrea
1895565375|2.0|This book was given to my best friend and her husband at their shower recently.  The following day they, her parents, his parents, and I all gathered to sort through the plunder.  My friend's husband uncovered this book in the piles and began to read it aloud - \\"story time for grown ups\\"    It starts out nicely enough: a mother rocking and loving her newborn, saying, \\"I love you forever, I like you for always...\\"etc, then to her toddler, and so on as her son ages.  It gets pretty weird when the mother drives across town (with a ladder), climbs up it and into her now adult son's second story bedroom window to rock him and sing to him in his sleep...yikes!!!  We were all cringing at that one.    I guess this must be an joke?      However, it takes a deeply unsettling turn when the grown son receives a call from his aging, weak mother who now cannot finish her repeated \\"I love you forever, I like you for always...\\" that is stated on every page as she rocks him lovingly in her arms as he ages.    At this point, we all began to tear up.      Over the last three pages, the son rushes to his dying mother's bedside, holds her in his lap, sings the song to her and rocks her before returning to his own home and taking his own newborn daughter in his arms and singing...    The entire room of 7 full-grown adults were absolutely in tears, passing tissues and her husband could barely finish the book!    I would NEVER give this book to a young child.  How frightening a prospect...your mommy dying???  Geez!!!  I know there are alot of people out there who love this book, and have deep emotional attachments to it - including many who formed attachments to them from their own childhood.   All I can say is that my own 7-year old freaked out when I mentioned one day that she would move out and have a house of her own some day.  To think of giving her a book that tells her I will be DYING...??      It's a great book to bawl to with a roomful of other adults, then laugh at yourselves.  But I could not recommend it for kids!  Read it at your own risk!!!
0143038419|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It is so well written and easy to read.  It is definitely a great book to give or recommend to a friend.
B000M341QO|3.0|Received in a timely manner. However it was not packed very well and the DVD shifted in it's box. Luckily it was not damaged or scratched.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|This CD was an instant favorite for me.  i bought the CD before seeing the DVD.  Love both.
B000TGJ8IU|4.0|the Quality of the packaging and the movies are excelent.  i regret i didnt have a nice entertainment system to support this nice DVD Set
B000V14GUS|5.0|Quincy Jones had a monster double single with these two songs. the title track from his the dude album is a good album banger. Q even drops a rap and you can hear the King of Pop Michael Jackson wailing in the background. the big hit though is \\"Just Once\\" where James Ingram gives a Classic Soulful Performance that is timeless. I have always been moved by this song. Incredible and Soulful then and still now.
6302293553|5.0|After seeing the Broadway musical,  I revisited this movie. It is comic perfection Monte Python style. You can watch this one again and again. With all of the lines committed to memory, we continue to watch, and we still love it!
B000Y179KO|4.0|It's been over 20 years since the Eagles released a full album of new material. To prove what a huge fan base they have, this double album has already sold over 7 millions copies. This is a really good album - not too far removed from their roots. No nasty surprises here - just good music. Lyrics are included in the liner notes which are quite helpful. Don't miss out on this one. Hopefully there will be more to come.
B000Y179KO|1.0|Please, this album is like another sequel to Police Academy or Rocky. Just stop - like their song title - I don't want to hear anymore. These are whiny, meaningless songs with only one intention: to make money. How many times can you break up? How many comeback tours?  I am a huge Eagles fan, but I am extremely disappointed in this album. This is the equivalent of a Michael Moore movie.
B000HEWEEY|4.0|This is a great product.  The color is vibrant (but the original was much duller and this makes some scenes seem a bit strange) and the added items on the CD are interesting for someone like myself who believes that this is one of the greatest old science fictions films.  The box is very cute but came slightly dented from shipping.  The Robbie doll is cute also.    My major criticism is that there was no text with the package that described the history or actors, for example.  When I noticed that the color seemed brighter I thought that the original might have been in black and white but could not find any info in the package about it.
B000F3A7LE|4.0|Terrific album.  Darryl Hall's vocal's are terrific.  Remastered 24 bit recording sounds great if you listen to it on a decent stereo.  The liner notes are so pretentiously idiotic and self-important though.  I assume it is a goof (a la Metal Machine Music); if he is serious, he has a slightly inflated view of his role in the Cosmos.
B00006J3WH|5.0|I am a big Buffy fan and I totally love this CD.  I bought it 6 months ago and it has not left my car yet.  When there is nothing on the radio, it is the first choice for the CD player.  I sing along and visualize the episode. LOVE IT!!!
B000YENUI6|3.0|Even though the acting is - for the most part - quite good and the film features an incredibly brutal and balls-out (cue rimshot) fight that's one of the most unusual in film history, EASTERN PROMISES kept such a chilly distance between the audience and the protagonists it was hard to relate or enjoy the film.<br /><br />This simply wasn't a patch on A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, although it was wonderful seeing the venerable Armin Mueller-Stahl in such a juicy role.<br /><br />It's a rental, not a permanent member of my DVD collection.
0142004235|4.0|East of Eden, with over 600 pages of text, may seem daunting at first, but throughout the entire length of the book, Steinbeck keeps the reader focused and on track with his masterful story telling. Set against the backdrop of the biblical tale of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel, this modern account is a must read for many.    Beginning his tale with the parents of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck follows this family for three generations, describing their lives and thoughts as they sadly reenact the lives of their Biblical counterparts. The only downside to this book is the introduction. Though it is fair from boring the first few chapters are slow. They are not as powerful as the rest of the book but it does create the proper context for the rest of the story. These few chapters bring us deep within the plot of the novel before flaring up and continuing full force for the rest of the book.  While East of Eden can be read for its plot and storyline, Steinbeck's writing allows it to be much more. One of the most intriguing aspects of this book is the characters. Each character behaves in a dynamic way, they change and grow and most importantly, live. Steinbeck so flawlessly portrays his characters that they seem real and alive. Their actions and thoughts mimic our thoughts as we read. The development and maturing of these characters are a joy to read. We are eager see as Cal struggles to live up to his brother's ability and talents while we watch as he weeps in his shadow. Cathy is another powerful character. Her chilling ability to destroy and ruin those that love her is uncanny. I have found it hard to comprehend the actions of her twisted mind as she slowly devastates those around her. Yet, this added another level to the story by introducing a wild and unpredictable character. It is exciting to read about her exploits and the evil she can unleash.     Though a story book by nature, East of Eden is able to incorporate deeper meaning with its complex characters. Cal's andthe other character's experiences become our own as we read and learn from their mistakes as they struggle through their version of Adam and Even and eventually, Cain and Abel.
0143038419|4.0|Many reviewers of this book really seem to detest it.  However, I disagree.  The author was incredibly honest about her mental state along the way.  I found the book to be a quick, easy read with an inspiring, teaching approach.  I enjoy reading travel novels because I can really get invested in a city and it's culture through a writer's narrative.  Although I don't consider this book to rank up there with the best of travel books(like Under the Tuscan Sun), I do give her credit for leading me through the difficult personal time she was experiencing.  She resisted the easy path of allowing the book to rest on the laurels of the countries themself and instead focused on her particular perspective and how it was enhanced by the native people and culture surrounding her.
6305181810|5.0|Terrific film featuring Bahstin favorite Damon fluently adapting southern dialect as a novice lawyer, genuinely interested in helping underdog clientele. DeVito is equally effective as a setup man who can't pass the Bar exam, but is a terrific funnel for future clients.The duet forms a legitimate partnership and away we go with Damon simultaneously defending a dying young man against a corrupt insurance company and a young woman, Danes, who finally puts an end to her wife beating husband.With DeVito doing the legwork, our heroes win both cases, too well in fact. The insurance company declares bankruptcy, no one wins a penny.Yet the family of the leukemia victim finds peace of mind in putting a corrupt firm out of business, while Danes and Damon depart together to contemplate their futures; their lives already deeply disillusioned.One point- the film's title may confuse some- this is not \\"Rainman\\" with Dustin Hoffman.However, this movie can stand on its own two feet in any weather, thank you.
B000VS6P9Q|3.0|Although this is definitely worth buying, there are a lot of lackluster performances.    Dylan puts so much emotion and soul into his singing.  I guess since his  voice isn't  gorgeous he makes up by dynamics.  Dylan also has more interesting rhythms than these singers use.  There are some rare songs and even Dylan himself on the last one.
B00005JPTI|4.0|Good and fairly realistic rendition of a doomsday scenario. I found myself wanting more (and that is good from a movie). Yes, the hollywood factor is still in there and it shows in some of the over the top action sequences, also the CGI is way too evident in the animals and creatures and tends to take away from  the whole experience (i am not a CGI fan). Overall: WELL DONE.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|There's been a trend of record companies not wanting to release an artists' material because it might not be successful recently, and Kelly Clarkson is just another mark on the board. Once again, here's proof that record execs should just let an artist live and learn.<br /><br />My December, Kelly Clarkson's newest offering, isn't as bad as some would lead you to believe, but it's also not as grand as others say. It's one of those CDs that has some great songs and some that you can pass over. Maybe with a bit more time she could've fixed a few songs to be more enjoyable, but this is still clearly KC, so I'm satisfied.<br /><br />This CD isn't perfect. Anyone who tells you that is most likely a jaded fan or someone who refuses to reason. Point number one...Hole. It's not a good song. It has no rhythm, the lyrics aren't great, it feels like a mess. However, My December does have Kelly's best song to date, Sober. Mainstream pop doesn't get a lot of unflinchingly honest songs (Christina Aguilera's Stripped-era songs are probably the most prominent examples), so to see an artist with as powerful a voice as Kelly's, who always uses it tastefully--yes, that's directed at Mrs. Aguilera--do a track like Sober is long overdue. One Minute is instantly likeable with a certain dance quality that many will love. Haunted finds Kelly the way I like her best, supported by a rock band.<br /><br />My favorite songs are One Minute, Sober, Haunted, Be Still, and Yeah. All in all, My December proves to be a worthy purchase. The good tracks outweigh the bad and anytime I can support an artist who deserves the attention they get, I gladly will. With vocals like Kelly Clarkson's, it's gonna be downright impossible to make a horrible CD, and My December only further proves the reason why Kelly is in a league of her own.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I had very low expectations for this film, especially after Apocalypse (I really liked the first one however). I am a sucker for zombie movies and I found this film to be much more involving than I thought. It was cleverly tied to the other two movies and has momentum and action with a fairly twisty ending. Overall: GOOD! (remember it is a zombie movie afterall!).
B000UBMWG4|4.0|First of all, I had to order this five disc version on Blu-ray from the abroad because Warner decided that ole Blighty need only have the five disc version on ordinary DVD. So criminally I bought this version from the U.S of A for less than the 2 disc Blu-ray version in England including delivery, No it didin't make sense to me either.    Now the review, I have to say they have done a superb job on remastering the picture and the audio on the final cut. Ridley's vision is there on screen sharp and so detailed and through uncompressed PCM, wow does the whole soundscape hit you, especially Vangelis's electrifying score.    Why only four out of five? Well, I was disapointed the two of the discs were ordinary dvd's, although both documentary / extra discs, I would have loved to seen them in hi def, especially the Dangerous Days doc, OK so it ran for three and a half hours but so does Kingdom of Heaven and it doesn't need to be the best compression rate ever.    Besides from that all I can say is if you love Bladerunner, you already have bought it.    if you like Bladerunner, then buy it and if you have never seen it then this is a grand place to start.     Oh and if you don't like Bladerunner, then why are you reading this?
B000000OF6|4.0|Looking back at the 1970s, sometimes many forget how big the band Queen was. Even as Queen moved into the 1980s, while their popularity did slightly decline in the United States, it continued to be very high in Europe. Their performance at Live Aid is widely considered one of the greatest of all-time and their subsequent \\"Magic\\" tour is considered one of the all-time greatest concert tours. If it weren't for Freddie Mercury's death in 1991, we might still be talking about Queen being as big a band as the Beatles. Numerous compilation albums are available containing much of Queen's music. The period from 1974-1980 is considered the period where Queen achieved its most popularity - especially in the United States. Following 1980, Queen's popularity continued, but this was mostly in Europe. However, there was a lot of good music still done by Queen, thus continuing their legacy. In 1981, Queen released an album \\"Greatest Hits\\" covering that 1974-1980 period. Ten years later, Queen would release a second greatest hits collection - \\"Greatest Hits Volume II\\", that would cover the post 1980 period until Mercury's death in 1991.   In 1994, these two volumes were combined into a single release entitled \\"Queen Greatest Hits I and II\\"    Queen is an example of the sum of the parts actually being greater than the whole. However, if you take each of the four members of Queen, they easily stand on their own as a top musician in their profession. Freddie Mercury is easily known to be the emotional and flamboyant lead vocalist of Queen who indeed has a legendary voice. Brian May is the legendary lead guitarist and probably the second most popular member of the band. Roger Taylor and John Deacon go extremely underrated. Listen to Taylor's thundering drumming in the studio or live and one can easily understand why he was asked to participate in an All Star Drum Jam (The S.O.S. All-Stars) at the Live Earth concert. As for John Deacon, he might be one of music's all-time underrated bass players. Many of his bass lines have proven to be the foundation for Queen's musical sound. In addition to being top musicians, all four members play integral roles in the songwriting.     For the most part \\"Greatest Hits I\\" covers eight of the nine albums from 1973 through 1980. The albums represented on the 1981 UK Version are \\"Queen II\\" (\\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\"); \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\" (\\"Killer Queen\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\"); \\"A Night at the Opera\\" (\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"You're My Best Friend\\"); \\"A Day at the Races\\" (\\"Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy\\", \\"Somebody to Love\\"); \\"News of the World\\" (\\"We Will Rock You\\", \\"We are the Champions\\"); \\"Jazz\\" (\\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\"); \\"The Game\\" (\\"Another One Bites the Dust\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"Save Me\\", \\"Play the Game\\"); \\"Flash Gordon\\" (\\"Flash\\"). The only album not represented is \\"Queen\\", however it is important to know that technically \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" appeared in an \\"unfinished\\" version on the \\"Queen\\" album. On \\"Queen II\\" the full version of \\"Seven Seas of Rhye\\" appears on that collection and that is the version that is included on this version of \\"Greatest Hits\\".      \\"Greatest Hits Volume II\\" covers the five albums from 1981 to 1991. These albums include: \\"Hot Space\\" (\\"Under Pressure); \\"The Works\\" (\\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"I Want to Break Free\\", \\"It's a Hard Life\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\"); \\"A Kind of Magic\\" (\\"A Kind of Magic\\", \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\", \\"Friends Will be Friends\\", \\"One Vision\\"); \\"The Miracle\\" (\\"I Want it All\\", \\"Breakthru\\", \\"The Miracle\\", \\"The Invisible Man\\"); \\"Innuendo\\" (\\"Innuendo\\", \\"Headlong\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\")     One thing that disappoints me about this collection is that despite the fact the two volumes are divided by time, the songs are not ordered in chronological order on each disco. One reason why I like greatest hits collections to be chronologically ordered is because it often shows how a band has progressed over time. Queen originally started as a good mix of progressive rock and early heavy metal. Queen would eventually move away from their progressive roots and incorporate a variety of other types of musical genres including a more theatrical type of element, a pop element, rockabilly, and even Dance/Disco (as demonstrated on the \\"Hot Space\\" album) The shuffling of the order of these sounds really takes away from seeing how Queen evolved their sound.    Quality-wise, one cannot complain about the content of the music in this collection. This contains some of Queen's most popular songs and shows a good continuum of their career.  However there are other greatest hits versions to consider. First up, the two volumes are available as single releases - \\"Greatest Hits\\"  and \\"Greatest Hits Volume II\\".   These would really only be worth it if you were interested in the specific time period each volume covers.       In addition to the two volumes being available as single volume releases. There are several other compilations available. Here are three others:    - \\"Greatest Hits Volume III\\": This covers latter material on the band. It focuses on collaborations with other artists (such as Elton John and George Michael) as well as solo material and unreleased material by the band.   - \\"The Platinum Collection\\": Includes all three volumes of the \\"Greatest Hits\\" series.  - \\"The Crown Jewels\\" is a boxed set that includes all Queen's first eight albums in their entirety (but doesn't include anything from \\"Volume II or III\\".     With the exception of \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\" not being included, Queen does a good job at providing a good snapshot of their musical portfolio.  However, a fan might be better served at getting \\"The Platinum Collection\\" as this is more complete and provides Volume III.    Therefore, I'd still opt for \\"The Platinum Collection\\" unless you really aren't interested in the rare material from \\"Greatest Hits Volume III\\".
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree continue their reign as one of the most popular progressive rock bands in the business by releasing another solid album \\"Deadwing\\" in 2005.  Comparison to their previous disc \\"In Absentia\\" abounds here, as \\"Deadwing\\" could easily be \\"In Abesentia\\" part II in many ways.  The band continue their flirtation with progressive metal, but there is also plenty of melodic almost pop stylings to keep things from going to far out on the metal wire.  Special guests Adrian Belew (King Crimson, The Bears) and Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth) lend their talents to several tracks and their influence is readily apparent.  I have seen some criticism of the lyrics on this disc and indeed Wilson's words are never really overtly profound, but as on other Porcupine Tree albums it is the way that the lyrics are delivered that truly makes them stand out as something special.  There are several great tracks to be found here including the title track \\"Deadwing\\", the pounding \\"Shallow\\", the uplifting \\"Lazarus\\", another rocker in \\"Halo\\" and \\"Open Car\\"  The highlight of the disc is the 12 minute \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" which contains all of the elements that make Porcupine Tree great.  Although I still don't think this one is quite as good as the band's middle period albums \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"Stupid Dream\\" this is still a great disc as the band continue to be a bright light on the progressive rock scene.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|I bought this movie because there were many reviews saying that the video quality was top notch - I knew nothing else of the movie itself except for the cast.  Well... I was more than pleasantly surprised.    Review of the movie: Very fun movie - not great for little kids - has some adult themes (I mean, DeNiro is a cross-dresser... explain THAT to a 5 year old).  But for teens & adults it's great.  The story was really interesting and slightly complex (it's based on a book).  But a lot of fun and the acting is great.    Review of HD DVD: This is where is gets AMAZING.  I have only had my HD DVD for about a month and I have seen some great clarity (Transformers, Harry Potter 5, Planet Earth) but this movie was above and beyond my expectations.  At some points in the movie it looked like it was in 3D, and at other points, it was like real life - as if I was actually standing there watching this movie be filmed.  If you want to truly see what your HD DVD Player can do, get this movie!
B000O75F7C|4.0|Porcupine Tree toured the world in a seemingly never ending road trip after the \\"Deadwing\\" album, so it was two years before their latest opus \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" would see light of day.  Among progressive rock fans \\"Fear\\" was one of the most anticipated releases of 2007.  The band had played much of it ahead of time on their \\"Deadwing\\" tour and most of the tracks had come across very well live.  Unfortunately the release did not quite live up to the hype in my opinion.  The album is a slight step down from their previous releases.  I can't really put my finger on what the difference is, but I just don't enjoy this one as much as most of the band's other discs.  That being said, the 17 minute epic track \\"Anesthetize\\" is one of the best things Porcupine Tree has ever recorded and really shows off the talents of drummer Gavin Harrison.  In fact Harrison's percussion work shines throughout this whole disc.  The title track \\"Fear Of A Blank Planet\\" is also a good one, but the rest of the album seems rather pedestrian by Porcupine Tree standards.  None of it is bad, but it does not seem to reach the high points that I know they are capable of.  The album features guest appearances by Alex Lifeson (Rush), Robert Fripp (King Crimson) and touring guitarist and solo artist John Wesley.  Overall this is another Porcupine Tree album well worth owning, and I still rate it a solid 4 stars, but I think they have done better.
B00008973A|4.0|Very entertaining, particularly if you love dance.  It's uplifting and a great work of art.  I highly recommend it and be sure to watch it at least 3 times.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|A great British film, trenchantly satirical in a fashion that is usually best mustered by the Brits, and as such is often hilariously funny: An insane US Air Force general called \\"Jack Ripper,\\" who starts the nuclear showdown with the Soviets, an entreaty by the US President(one of three roles well- if inexplicably played by Peter Sellers)of two men bickering that \\"You can't fight in here -- this is the War Room!\\", the opening scene of in-air refuelling, strongly suggestive of sexual intercourse, and everything in between. If you're keen, you'll note the often-subtle pokes at Americans and their various institutions, which British humor has been at for some time; they do quite well, thank you.
B000007ODL|5.0|I got the JJ Cale and Eric Clapton colaboration album \\"THE ROAD TO ESCONDIDO\\" and loved the sound. If you like that album, you will love this one too.
B000RJO58M|5.0|Not only is the movie entertaining and satisfying, but the video transfer is gorgeous, the audio packs significant punch, and there are approximately eighteen hours of entertaining supplemental materials.    Judged in comparison to the standard-def DVD, the video and audio packages are both significantly improved, and this HD DVD even includes ten hours of features that aren't even available on the US-released DVD.    Simply put, in my opinion, this is currently the best overall high-def release on the market -- especially when you factor in the price. Purchasing 'Hot Fuzz' on HD DVD is a no-brainer for fans and an easy recommendation for newcomers. This is what high definition is all about.
0143038419|4.0|I found reading it very entertaining and insightful.  I kept thinking I would love to spend 4 months in Italy.  I think anyone with an open mind will enjoy this book.
B000N6TX22|5.0|Simply put, I adore 'Children of Men,' Alfonso Cuaron's bleak vision of mankind's self-destructive nature and the absolute necessity of hope. I tend to be harsher when evaluating the video and audio packages of films I enjoy, so I was excited to find a great visual transfer and an impressive sound mix. The supplements could've used more meat, but the extras provided are entertaining for the most part, and we even get an HD exclusive \\"U-Control\\" track. As a fan of this film, I'd pick it up in a heart beat. For everyone else, it's certainly worth a try -- just don't expect answers to all of your questions.
B000053V7O|5.0|\\"Round Midnight\\" is an exceptional piece of art in which the music acts almost as another main character.  The lead performances are very good, and the all-star group of musicians make the soundtrack absolutely first-rate.  However, I found the direction to be the strong point of the film.  I know some people have suggested Scorsese had a heavy hand in directing even though he's only officially credited as a cast member, and perhaps they're right, but I thought it seemed uniquely distinct from just about anything I've ever seen, including Martin's films.  The film is not a typical, sign-posted Hollywood standard and the style of the script takes some getting used to, but like most fine art, the completed piece is far superior to any single element, and the rich layering lends itself to enjoyment on subsequent viewings.  A+!
B00005JPXY|4.0|Cloverfield is so unique it's so hard to describe.  It is mainly an action movie, but its artistic because it's filmed like the \\"Blair Witch\\" in first person camcorder-style.  Mix in a bit of a Godzilla movie with some demonology ie, Cthulu, from H.P. Lovecraft, and some serious sound effects from tanks, bombs, screams, and choppers and you can't turn away.  Any one who likes Sci-fi, or religious movies like Hellboy will like this movie.  The camera seems to move too much in a few instances, and some unbelieveably foolish choices by the main charecter made me want to smack him, but they add to the suspense.  Lastly, the movie was less than 90 minutes, a disappointment.  The ending just sneaks up on you, leaving you wanting so much more, and wanting answers.  A must see,,, not only for the hype around it, but for being a HD-Classic monster movie.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|When Paramount Pictures finally released the retro science-fiction adventure film, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, September of 2004, it had been much anticipated since June when it was first intended to hit theatres. Was the delay, due to director, Kerry Conran's additional tweaking of this virtually total CGI movie, worth it? You bet your MAC IIci it was!<br /><br />Sky Captain was a debut not only for its director. It was also the first motion picture done entirely with no sets, locations or props. The actors were real but everything from 1930-style city scapes to exploding zeppelins and flying robots were digitally rendered. \\"A lot of filmmakers would find it limiting, but I find it strangely liberating,\\" said Conran in an interview with Frank Rose in Wired Magazine. Actor, Gwyneth Paltrow, however had another take on working in the computerized blue-screen void: \\"You get a little nuts in that blue,\\" said Paltrow. &iexcl;°I started to feel like, if I ever see this color again, I'm going to kill myself.\\"<br /><br />Conran had set out a decade ago to make a black and white movie set in the 1930s about a mad scientist and his robot army. When no studio offered the novice the $100 million to re-create the era, Conran turned to computer generated imagery to provide him his richly imagined world. This ironically gave Conran the liberty to create his imagined world just in the way he wanted, which included a clever mixture of obvious animation with sharp realism; multi-textured imagery, creations of realistic fantasy and the use of \\"brushing\\", superimposed images, imaginative angles and muting in  mostly sepia-toned settings. Packing every frame with a terraced layering of visual details only rivalled by Scot Ridley's films (e.g., Bladerunner, Alien) Conran's film is worth watching several times just to study the details within the rich expanse of its sweeping tapestries.<br /><br />\\"Drawing from a well of pulp fiction, film noir and comic book imagery -- not to mention  influences from the Wizard of Oz and Metropolis\\" (Allison Benedikt, Chicago Tribune), Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a stylish and elegant film with a genuine mood and look of a 1930s motion picture. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Polly Perkins, a gutsy reporter who discovers that the world's scientists are disappearing. After witnessing a giant robot invasion, in which Sky Captain, the mercenary hero-for-hire (Joe Sullivan, played by Jude Law), is called in to help fight, Polly seeks him out to help her solve the mystery. Undaunted by his sour reception, Polly strikes a bargain with Joe and they form a shaky alliance based on mutual distrust and peppered with good wordplay.<br /><br />Polly's obsession over getting her front-page story and the ultimate photograph plays counterpoint with her vulnerable attraction to Joe. He is a much maligned mercenary with a just heart and a weak stomach beneath his tough bravado. We learn very soon into the story that the strong-willed nosy reporter shares a history with the legendary swashbuckling Sky Captain, and that they'd parted some time ago on rather ill, if not dubious, terms. Sky Captain's cool bluster and nasty insults barely mask his weakness for the lady, making us wonder what happened between these two earlier to make their coffee bitter-sweet.<br /><br />Polly and Joe's search for a mysterious scientist, who formed a secret organization outside Berlin called Unit Eleven and thought to be behind the machine armies, leads them across the globe to exotic locales from the stormy Himalaya mountains of Nepal to Dr. Totenkopf's tropical island in the middle of the Pacific.<br /><br />Conran rendered his 1930's mood with relentless consistency in everything from his authentic sets in sepia-tones to casting the most appropriate actors. The actors who played the principal characters looked like they'd come from that time period. Conran went so far as to resserect an actor from that era, the late Sir Laurence Olivier, to play Dr. Totenkopf (German for deadhead). He achieved this by using CGI-manipulated archive footage of Olivier.<br /><br />Conran keeps the actual plot fairly simple, which lets him ensnare the movie-watcher into his mesmorizing alternate universe. For instance, watching a zeppelin dock atop a New York sky scraper at night  transported me to a place that might have existed but never did. It was like entering another dimension. When the flying robots first appeared in the New York evening sky, looking like one of my old alien-attack nightmares, I felt a kind of deja vu with all the old 1950s SF movies. I kept feeling like I'd slipped through some crack between time into an alternate universe where all the inventions that didn't take here actually worked. It was as though I was trapped in a dream where history had rewritten itself. This strangely enticing mixture of familiar with the unfamiliar is a common device of retro-fiction, sometimes called recursive fiction that has become quite popular. Examples include, among many, Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials trilogy and Jasper Fforde's Tuesday Next series. The recent film, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is another example.<br /><br />I also didn't mind Conran's replete use of old SF cliches like a scientist's Frankensteinesque laboratory, ray guns, metal-rivetted robots, or even a tongue-in-cheek reference to a come-on gesture made famous in the Matrix. The reason I didn't mind was that he wasn't just borrowing these, he integrated them into his retro fantasy and turned them on their sides. It also didn't matter that some of the concepts didn't make sense in the physics of our world. An example is the British Royal Navy's mobile air strip. When Sky Captain's shark-tooth painted plane runs out of gas over the middle of the ocean, he lands it on an incredible airborne landing strip run by Frankie (Angelina Jolie) of the Royal Navy, a no-nonsense girl of erect stature, sporting a patch over one eye, and who turns out to be Polly's former rival for Joe's affections.<br /><br />From its first spectacular zeppelin scene to its last, Sky Captain races with non-stop action, punctuated only by frequent comic relief. The adrenalin surging airborn chase through the streets of New York city combined high tension with taught humor through characters' witty banter -- something North American movie goers have come to expect in action movies. Paltrow's and Law's sometimes clever and amusing bickering lies much in the vein of legendary actors of that era such as Hepburn and Tracy or Bogart and Bacall and of a more current scoundrel and his lady, Han Solo and Leia Organa in Star Wars.<br /><br />Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow entertains in ways classic motion picture was intended since its inception. Conran delivers a full meal of action-adventure, spiced with a strong salsa of character repartee. The ending is spectacular, moving and humerous at the same time. A feat not easily achievable in films today.<br /><br />Sky Captain has drawn incredibly mixed reviews, from: it never exceeds the level of a clever exercise (Carla Hall, San Francicso Chronicle) and has no emotional centre (Sarah Chauncey, Reel.com) to it is a dazzling and groundbreaking film &iexcl;­ the most fun you'll have at the movies this year. (Jeffrey Brunner, des Moines Register). This dichotomy of opinion is understandable because no film can be all things to all people.<br /><br />However, I strongly disagree with critics who pan Sky Captain as shallow and boring. I believe that this action-adventure delivers exactly what it was designed to deliver: a visually impressive and entertaining story.<br />Summing up both ends of the critical spectrum, Stephen Holden (The New York Times) says it best: \\"When Sky Captain remembers that storytelling and characters matter more than design and special effects, it charms as well as impresses.\\").

B0000A1RJI|5.0|This is great listening music! This is great acting music!! All the members of my family enjoy listening to the soundtrack from the Pirates of The Caribbean:  The Curse of The Black Pearl.  The children take advantage of the music and reenact their favorite parts of the movie.  When you hear this music...there is no doubt that it is from Pirates of the Caribbean!  It is definately going to be on a classic movie listening list.
0143038419|3.0|There was so much hype surrounding this book that I rushed out to buy it only to discover it was pretty disappointing. The first half of the book (Italy up through the middle half in India) was a chore to read. I wanted to enjoy this book and really share in her experiences and her journey, but honestly I found it so difficult to feel much empathy for her. The book does improve by the time she hits Bali, and this is only because other characters are introduced and so you finally get a chance to hear other people's thoughts, a welcome break from her blatherings found in the first half of the book.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Sunshine is at least a four star flick. My issue with JP's issues:    \\"1. A flight toward the sun? Crash and burn.\\" ... well, seeing as how this is (partially) the premise of the story, I think this qualm should fall under the suspension of disbelief.  No flight to the sun = no movie.    \\"2. No one over thirty allowed on a mission to save the planet? We could  use some experience, folks.\\"... Actors in sunshine over 30: Cliff Curtis is almost 40, Michelle Yeoh is about 45 as is Hiroyuki Sanada, Benedict Wong is 37, Troy Garity is 34 and basically, you don't have a point. Do your research next time. I'm 30 and I look 20. I know people who are 30 something and look well into their 40's but that's neither here nor there.    \\"3. Similarly, the cast passed the Abercrombie and Fitch test, but no one  in the crew passed their psychological exams. Meltdown!\\"... well, you see, if there weren't psychological meltdowns and everyone on board was an ace, no a near robot, there wouldn't be much of a movie. Plus, these people are on a suicide mission for the survival of their species, of course there are going to be breakdowns...      Two other points I'd like to make:    A. The film is not just about a mission to reignite the sun but also a war between the best of mankind and the worst of mankind.  To varying degrees, in the large cast of crew members--and the one eventual stow away--we see every facet of man being good and evil.    B. Something is wrong with your ears if you are not able to enjoy the amazing soundtrack EVEN IF you hated the story.  It is powerful, at times haunting and yet triumphant.
0446577391|5.0|I received this novel as a present and read it in two days.    I couldn't put it down.    Great characters, great story, great gift for any guy and any fan of the TV show 24.  Lots of action, double crossing, spies, heroes, bad guys, good guys, bad guys who become good guys, all the works.  I also recommend [[ASIN:B000PC6XBI Prince of Fire]] by Daniel Silva for anyone who likes this novel.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|I liked the movie although a bit drawn out.<br /><br />The message was not so clear, even thought I can get an idea of what they were going for, but using a rat for this message was lost to me due to the nature of a rat.<br /><br />Fun, colorful and a bit offbeat. I would rather had rented it first.
0938045695|5.0|It's the same kettlebell exercises that you'll find everywhere else, but what is different is that he PREPARES you to do them CORRECTLY!  Through his prep-exercises and his technique descriptions, I believe you'll get much, much more out of doing these exercises than from just following along on the DVD that came with your kettlebell.
B000066C1N|5.0|I love Bryan Adams, and this is no exception! Bryan brings an authentic vocalization to this movie about Spirit! My lil one loves this music! We sing it in the car, at home and when ever. Not to mention that she loves horses. I love how Bryan can eloquently tie into the music the Native American heritage and that is what moves me the most since I am part Native.<br /><br />I would recommend this just cause!

0671027387|5.0|Dan Brown's Deception Point is a fast-paced, hard to put down thriller that is extremely well written.  For those looking for a great story that keeps the imagination running this is a must read.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|Pay no attention to the Editorial reviews.  They just don't get it.  This movie is amazing.      Have you ever had a dream that was so real, you were shocked when you woke up?  So did Henry Letham, the young man this movie revolves around.  It is your privilage to enter into this dream and follow him as he transitions from confusion to understanding.  It ends when he finally wakes from his dream, where you learn of his unfortunate situation.      The backdrop of this dreamscape is filled with hauntingly artistic imagery, which is masterfully matched with deep fluid tones that complete the sound track.  The actors are a perfect compliment to the story.    Allow yourself to be taken into this dream and it will become a personal memory of your own.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Like many Austin fans on both sides of \\"the pond,\\" I eagerly awaited this new version of 'Persuasion.'  I've long been a fan of the '90s adaptation starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, and I wanted to see how 'Masterpiece Theater' would interpret the novel.    And I was not disappointed!  I was pleased with the two leads, Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones.  Both actors turned in excellent performances and had real chemistry, a must for this film--they made you believe that their characters' love, denied for so long, was still real and present in their lives.  Sally Hawkins as Anne was especially good; she radiated such sincerity in the role.  The camera would often linger on her face, and she revealed much about her character without saying a word.    I was also pleased that the actors actually looked the ages of their parts.  Although I loved Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in the previous version, I often had difficulty believing their characters were in their late 20s and early 30s, respectively.     An excellent version--my only regret is that it isn't longer!
0385333846|5.0|Great book. Vonnegut has a style unlike most other authors, but if I was to try and type-cast him he would be a Mark Twain/George Orwell/Philip K. Dick hybrid--though that would still not completely encompass his style.
0375842209|5.0|I made an exception for The Book Thief. I usually avoid reading books that take place in Nazi Germany during WWII as I find them depressing. I decided to read just one more, The Book Thief, since it was supposed to be so good. Well, it wasn't so good it was exceptional. I'm glad I caved. Narrated by Death who turns out to be rather charming and has an odd way with words, the story centers around a German girl named Liesel Meminger a lover of reading, a sufferer of sorrows and a stealer of books. As I expected it was extremely sad but also extremely satisfying. The creativity of the narration and artistry of phrasing make this a book unlike any I have read before and one I will want to read again. I hope I can control my tears next time, but I doubt it.
060619472X|4.0|I read this book my senior year of high school (now a good bit of time in the past) and it's impression still resonates to this day now 8 years later. I found it to be particularly interesting that the author of this book was christian and that the story had religious undertones regarding the importance of consent to goodness. I think literature can tend to take on new interpretive qualities apart from what the author intends, but that bit definitely is there.
1594489505|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Recommended reading for everyone to learn about the customs and culture of a country in turmoil.
1596680296|5.0|I can't tell you how much I love this book.  I took a sock knitting class and I still referred to this book.  The photos are excellent for learning the steps involved in making the sock.  All the instructions are there that you need to make a basic sock plus everything you need to move beyond that.      This is truly an excellent book and great for your knitting library!
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|There may be plenty of tabloid stories out there about Miss Spears. There may be many theories as to her mental state, to her devotion as a parent, to her capability as a functioning member of society. And, in the past, there have been plenty of objections to her capabilities as an artist. Any negative opinion towards Britney is encouraged to exist, if not flourish; especially currently. But despite the current movement against pop music, and against Britney, there is no denying that \\"Blackout\\" is a stellar record.    It doesn't matter who is in control. If the public image of Miss Spears is to be believed, she is completely and utterly out of control; the general public is only left to conclude that the multitude of producers and writers steered the direction of this album. Whatever the general public believes, \\"Blackout\\" is a defiant release, an album that crackles with verve from opening to close.    The production on \\"Blackout\\" is impeccable. Even when Britney was composing the majority of her own records, her songs were never this personal or this current. Whether Britney is partying, conquering men, or controlling the parties and the men, the songs are a clear indication of her mentality and her direction as an artist. The beats are sharp, her singing is simultaneously anonymous enough to conquer pop radio, and specific enough to impart her personality upon each of these twelve tracks. Whether it's the inebriated haze of first single \\"Gimme More,\\" the aggravated crackle of \\"Piece of Me,\\" or the sheer audacity of the rap/spoken-word \\"Freakshow,\\" Britney is clearly at the top of her game. And whether she were the driving force behind the album is moot -- she was most certainly cognizant enough to hire the correct producers and writers, because \\"Blackout\\" has a rhythm that Miss Spears, or \\"Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,\\" if you're nasty, could have only dreamed of.
B000I2J79K|5.0|I got lucky when I found this last piece of dvd on the shelf of a store, already on sale. I played it on my regular dvd, and WOW! It's right on the money and all my jazz fan viewers agreed! Last weekend, I had to connect an HDTV and surround sound for an instant 3-hour party, we can't get enough of Earth, Wind & Fire, so we played part 1 again 'till midnight ... as expected, everybody went out looking for this dvd. I am now endorsing amazon.com to them to simplify their hunt.   Warning: After getting this rare collection, it is hard to find another music dvd that will satisfy your expectations. I'm still looking for an equally great release...
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|Although I've seen the movie numerous times, some of the scenes still sent chills down my back, such as River being \\"triggered\\" and cleaning up the bar with its on-the-wrong-side-of-the-law clientle, and the final battle with the Reavers.  River's dialogue consisting of double meanings and answers that portent the future revelation of Miranda, is ever intriguing.<br /><br />The commentary by Joss Whedon makes the Collector's Edition worth purchasing.  His insights into the relation between Mal and River put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.  Particularly, it wasn't clear to me why the Captain saved River by bringing her back aboad the ship after the fight in the bar.  It didn't register with me, until Whedon pointed it out, that River and the Captain were the most alike of all the characters.<br /><br />I, like many others, hope this is not the last flight of Serenity.  But if it is, there was no better way to finish the story than with this outstanding work of art.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child and I still have to watch it every year.  Still gives me shivers.  Natalie Wood is such an adorable child in this.  The whole cast is great.  You'll believe!!
B000YRY8BG|5.0|[[ASIN:B000YRY8BG State of Play (Miniseries)]]  Outstanding story, great cast and superb direction!  The cast includes some of the best British actors of current day.  A great story that, for once, doesn't talk down to the audience.  If you appreciate a good suspense film try this one.  Everyone I have shown this to loves it.  I can't imagine how this can be shortened into a feature length movie, at least the film is using the original writer.  Here's to hoping that there will be a second season of this series.
0312360266|4.0|This book was pretty good. a little too cliche and immature for me, at 17 years old, although very good imagery and overall plot.
0307237702|5.0|Barack Obama's Audacity of Hope is a wonderful book that has helped me become a more informed voter. He comes across as candid, thoughtful, honest, and intelligent. He lets you know where he stands on a whole host of issues, ranging from faith to values to race, foreign policy and families.      True, he doesn't offer specific 10-point plans for solving the country's problems. But I think voters who expect that from a candidate not yet in office are kidding themselves; America's problems are horribly complex, and each President must assess the unique situation when he or she takes power and prioritize among a myriad of urgent dilemmas facing the country.     The real strength of this book is that it reveals Obama as an open-minded man of the Center. He is not interested in listening to the vociferous and unreasonable demands of the far right or the far left. He is a man of thoughtful judgment concerned with weighing what he calls \\"values and countervailing values\\" to come to a just decision.  A small case in point: Obama notes in his book, \\"Too often in our national debates we don't even get to the point where we weigh these difficult choices. Instead, we either exaggerate the degree to which policies we don't like impinge on our most sacred values, or play dumb when our own preferred values conflict with important countervailing values...it's easy to get most liberals riled up about government encroachments on freedom of the press...but if you have a conversation with these same liberals about the potential costs of regulation to a small business owner, you will often draw a blank stare.\\"    Obama as a president truly would bring different groups together in dialogue because he acknowledges the legitimate viewpoints on both sides. As a country, Democrats need to realize that they are only partially right and Republicans need to realize that they also don't have all the right answers. Obama is a man that can transcend this pettiness, and this book helps outline howit can be done.
0743467345|1.0|I CANNOT BELIEVE ALL OF THE 4 and 5 STAR REVIEWS! NOT EVEN WORTHY OF 1 STAR!!!!!    \\"Mr. Perfect\\" was a pathetic excuse for a novel. Horrible writing and dialogue throughout. Every other line seemed to be \\"he/she burst into a roar of laughter,\\" when the previous sentence was a far-fetched grasp for humor--not witty or funny at all. And the attempt to make a brutal murder mystery packed with witt and jokes was just in bad taste if you ask me. How can anyone relate to that? Especially because none of the attempted humor was the least bit funny, just ridiculous and awkward.    Basic premise of the book: Four 30-40 year-old coworkers go out to dinner every Friday after work. One evening they decide to make a list of attributes of the \\"Perfect Man.\\" Someone at work leaks the list and it is published in the office newsletter. For some reason, \\"Good Morning America,\\" interviews the 4 friends and reports this list as headline news. A psycho finds out about the list, is enraged by it and goes on a murdering rampage. The murder mystery was so predictable, I knew who the killer was about 200 pages before Linda Howard intended.     Meanwhile during the psychotic murder mystery, the heroine Jaine and the hero Sam Donovan (the hunky next-door neighbor, who just happens to be a detective) have lusty sex once or twice,right after one of Jaine's closest friends is brutually murdered. Would you really be intersted in sex at a time like that? And to top it off he asks her to marry him and she agrees after sleeping together once and knowing each other for about a week. The sex scenes were rough and harsh--nothing romantic here--trash actually.     I'm sorry I finished this. Don't waste your time.     This is 3 in a row for me where Linda Howard has struck out big time. No more Howard for me, I think.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|I'm not kidding: this film actually saved my life during a period of anxiety disorder I had while I was living at the other side of the planet. I owe my sanity to The Dude. I'm biased so I won't say anything else about the film. I can say, however, something else about the DVD: Great transfer, good extras, and at the beginning of the film, a little fake introduction about the film \\"restoration\\" that fans will love. A great noir comedy in a respectful edition.
1401201911|5.0|This self contained alternate history of Superman and the DC universe is exactly the sort of great storytelling that the graphic novel format was invented for.  Not only is it entertaining in a spot-the-reference kind of way but it also manages to reinforce one of the more relevant historical lessons of our time: however well intentioned a dictator starts out, eventually power becomes its own end.    What makes this graphic novel especially brilliant is that it delivers this lesson without changing the essential nature of the main characters.  Superman lands on the steppes of Soviet Russia and is raised on a farm collective where he internalizes the dream of socialist utopia.  The result is a man whose bearing and morality are identical to the American icon we know and love, but whose political philosophy is diametrically opposed.  Lex Luthor, with no one to stop him, grows to unparalleled power in America which he duly abuses.  He is the same megalomaniac we know and loathe, prone to casual murder, constant pontificating, and spousal abuse (of Lois Lane, no less!)  And yet, as the story progresses it is clear that for all his faults Lex is only a would be petty tyrant, while Superman is a dictator in the terrifying mold of Stalin himself.  There are even a few jokes about the two \\"men of steel\\" sprinkled into the early chapters.    Unfortunately, Lex seems to have no better luck stopping Superman here than he does in the regular  series, and soon America is the only country in the world not under Soviet control.  I won't spoil the resolution here, but suffice it to say that it plays on Superman's essentially moral nature to very good effect.  There's also a virtual post-script that introduces a twist to the whole story, but I found it a little weak, and I decided to ignore it.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|Like a lot of the Coen Brother's recent stuff, its whole is less than the sum of its parts, concerning itself with style rather than plot, and with witty, smirking dialog substituting for a storyline.  What keeps the movie going throughout a largely rudderless middle and ending is great dialog and acting.  When you have the Coen brothers writing and three of the best character actors in the business (Philip Seymour Hoffman, Steve Buscemi and John Turturro), you can't go too far wrong.  And the point of the movie -- life is too short to get stressed out -- is well-taken.<br /><br />Also, this movie is much better on multiple viewings.  If you saw it once and thought \\"eh - o.k. I guess\\" then I recommend watching it again.  It will improve the second time.
0142000663|3.0|They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Steinbeck will use a thousand words to paint a picture. He goes overboard with the detail, making it boring by modern standards, encouraging the reader to skip over entire paragraphs. It does, however, paint a very detailed picture of what life must have been like during the depression. His research was quite good. I can just see him wandering around Oklahoma and California with notebook in hand, jotting down endless details to give the book a realistic flavor. One time he used two full pages, and entire Chapter in this case, to describe a turtle crossing the road! The result is an often dull, but educational experience, if that's what you read it for. Most people buy novels for the suspense, because they are page turners. That's modern fiction, geared to readers that spend too much time watching car chases on TV. This book, however, is literary.<br /><br />  One big problem I have with this book is the profanity. Over and over, several times a page at times, Steinbeck take's the Lord's name in vain. I read Christian fiction most of the time so that was a real turnoff. Still, I gave it three stars because it was educational and it gave me a deep appreciation for the blessings God has given me, compared to the plight of the Joad family and so many like them. Maybe if they didn't take God's name in vain so much they would have had an easier time!
0307387151|1.0|The first three chapters in thousands of unnecessary words describe this mundane activity that doesn't go anywhere. By the 5th chapter, I couldn't take it any longer and put the book down for good; and I really like the closure of finishing a book. This was just a chore to try to read.
0307387178|5.0|An attention-grabbing piece of work.  The author has justifiably given young Chris McCandless a place in the sun.<br />My first thought was why read a story where one already knows the outcome?  I was wrong.  Jon Krakauer has turned this narrative into an extreme adventure, with flavorings of mystery and the psychological to fasten it all together.<br />While weaving his own and others' daring experiences into the wilds...the author has also dug deep to search out every scrap of McCandless' travels and demeanor through letters, writings, etc. to better understand this young man's inner being.<br />Krakauer's final estimation as to McCandless' demise in the wilds of Alaska is very credible.<br />A commanding read.
B000E6EJAC|5.0|The legend is pretty well carved in granite. After building a mammoth reputation as a live act but seeing their albums fail commercially, Mott The Hoople called it quits. Overend Watts hits a David Bowie audition for work; Bowie is so freaked out that Mott is over that he convinces them to let him shape their image and offers them a couple songs to record. The band rejects \\"Suffragette City\\" but takes \\"All The Young Dudes.\\" When success comes with Mott coming on as a glammed out rock band, old fans cried sell out.<br /><br />Ef-em. What Bowie did was give the band focus (something manager/producer Guy Stevens never managed) and let Ian Hunter get confident. While that may have begun the band's unraveling, it also meant that Mott The Hoople were flexing some serious new muscle. Although the songs on \\"All The Young Dudes\\" were pretty much written before Bowie came into the picture, the production touches are what made this album stand away from the rest. There was still plenty of innuendo to go around (lick an ice cream come, anyone?), the guitars were still loud and rocking and there was still input from the rest of the band. Vernon Allen's vocal on \\"Soft Ground\\" adds a twist from Hunter's songs, and Mick Ralphs contributed \\"Ready For Love\\" before taking it top 40 with Bad Company a few years later.<br /><br />Thing was, it was lack of input for following albums that made this Mott The Hoople's pinnacle. Allen split before [[ASIN:B000E6EJA2 Mott]] because of frustration with his songs being pushed aside by Hunter, and Ralphs began thinking about Bad Company when \\"Can't Get Enough\\" was turned down. Mott became Hunter's vehicle, and given that he's a brilliant songwriter, that wasn't always a bad thing. But for sheer force and defining a moment (plus giving us one of the great gender-bending anthems of all time), \\"All The Young Dudes\\" changed the way the world looked at glam.
0446401307|5.0|I have read each of Michael Connelly's novels and this is yet another excellent read.  Harry Bosch is a great character and he always seems to amaze me.  I would highly recommend this book, especially if you have read the Bosch novels in the past.  I can hardly wait for the next book.
B00004T9VY|5.0|No, I don't wish to get into either the personal life or the politics of the, now controversial, Cat Stevens. If we did that, we'd probably drop Pete Townsend, James Brown, Jim Morrison, Elton John and a laundry list of other rock notables.<br /><br />I clearly remember when a high school pal of mine, Billy Duffer, told me to snag this album. Billy must have made a secret study of contemporary music because he was always spot-on about what was \\"good\\" and what was \\"lousy\\". Anyway, I bought the album and I've never regretted that choice. This folk-rock compilation didn't come out of the box like a fireball, but rather, gained a flywheel's momentum as more and more listeners of the day heard this great music.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: \\"In 2003, the album was ranked number 206 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time.\\"<br /><br />I'd put it in the top 100; however, I would qualify my rating by noting that this musical work may have had more appeal in it's chronological Woodstock environment and that the music really does not stand the all-important test of time, in the same way that Elvis' early works will generate little interest in, say, 2040, when all his bug-eyed fans are long dead and gone.<br /><br />\\"Tea for the Tillerman\\" yields Free Love Society folk-rock, very acoustic piano ballads, and the compositions carry the hearers' burden of Cat Stevens' rather distinctive (some would say \\"weird\\"), vocal attributes. This album is certainly not for everyone; however, those who like it will REALLY like it.<br /><br />As a final comment, and perhaps this comes off as a \\"great review-noir,\\" I would just observe that this album/CD is an integral facet of our rock music history, like it or not.
B00005KB9T|5.0|Catch a Fire is a CD that I have been looking for for a long time.  Bob Marley is one of my top favorite musicians.  It is a used CD, but in very good condition.
B000Y179KO|1.0|This group's songs gave me such good times throughout my early adulthood, but I fear their focus is now on money rather than music. Aside from the monumental ticket prices for shows, this must be only group in the current charts who does not allow previews of their songs on amazon, in any country. Before I spend hard-earned money on a CD it would be fair to try the product. It would cost them nothing to do what every other artist does, and that is to offer 30-second previews. So, the one star is for the single, which I've heard is a solid tune, and that's as good as it gets until I find a cheap, used copy.
067960085X|5.0|This is a great little story that I read in two short sittings. Truman Capote's poetic use of words is wonderful. His writing is descriptive and poetic, but never stodgy or long winded. He also has a humor to his writing in this story which I like a lot. Holly Golightly is a wonderful character, she is very hard to figure out, for he reader and the narrator, but that is part of her character.  Being a male, its especially interesting how Capote can write a young woman like Holly so well.<br /><br />Even though this book was written over 50 years ago, the writing is fresh, has a great flow to it, and is timeless.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I first heard this movie was boring, but I honestly think this is because people are so watered-down nowadays with easy-come entertainment that they miss real literature. Now it takes a little thinking; this movie is absolutely saturated with symbolism. It is originally a book, good sign, but it's also Tim Burton's portrayal that really makes this movie shine. Coupled with Danny Elfman's score, and excellent performances by McGregor (I used to not like him because of Star Wars but now I love him) and Bonham-Carter, this is not only a must-see but a must-keep.    This story comes from the perspective of a son who has become absolutely sick of his father's \\"tall tales.\\" Most of the movie consists of the father's \\"flashbacks,\\" but unlike most movies who tried pulling this type of thing off, meshes it very nicely with the present day so that themes, contrasts, etc. can match nicely.      Now, at the end of the movie, what we realize is not the intrinsic value of tall tales but that it is really your perception of your own life, rather than incidents that happen, that truly define it. Course, I could just say that, but it is so much more effective in the unique, beautiful manner that Ewan McGregor's story tells it. Each of the \\"tall tales\\" that annoy(ed) the son (see, you have to watch the movie to find out if the son ever gets over it) tell a specific story or message, and through the exaggerations the points of these stories are seen more clearly.    So, watch this movie carefully. Far from boring, it will captivate you, entertain you, and possibly make you think about your own life. What if it really is your perception rather than what actually happens that defines your life? Think about it.
0143038419|4.0|I thank the seller for sending me the EIGHT copies so quickly to me.  I was able to hand them out as X-mas gifts.   My friends and I have started a book club and this is the first book we are reading. We all want to see how Liz learned about herself and use those examples to learn about ourselves.  I haven't finished things, but so far I like what I see. Thank you!

B000E8QVWY|4.0|I have watched this one a few times and enjoy it on every viewing. The songs are great and the story is interesting.  I don't know exactly how accurate it is to the real Johnny Cash's life, but I've heard it's pretty close.  I just know it kept me hooked to the screen.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My wife bought me the complete series of Planet Earth as a Christmas gift.  I have it on Blu Ray definition plus I have a Blu Ray dvd player. the content of this dvd is awsom, you have never seen something like this before, plus the blu ray definition makes it more perfect.I would recommend everyone to buy this product from amazon.com, they have the cheapest price, plus my kids in the future will love to watch it.
1933652446|2.0|The \\"BedBook\\" format is so unusual, it should be made more clear to purchasers....I wouldn't have been interested if I had known this.
1580084621|5.0|I cannot heap enough praise on this book. Many people don't care about authenticity, and that's fine, but real cuisine gets lost that way. This work preserves the recipes for real Thai cuisine, (as opposed to the Westernized pastiche that usually passes) but goes the extra length to mention when substitution with Western ingridients (for example vegetables) is appropriate for a dish. You do not need another Thai cookbook, although Kasma Loha-Unchit's are wonderful. I wish there were a few more authors to preserve Burmese, Khmer, Viet, Lao,and Malay food in the same ridiculously comprehensive, academic, and educational way. I will literally use the book until I learn the recipes and preperations by heart (which will take a few years at least).
B000UX6THK|4.0|This thing is encyclopedic!!!!!  Particularly interesting is a number of recent interviews and commentaries with the actors from the series (other than of course for Jack Nance, who died several years ago). Kimmy Robertson has put on some weight, but still retains that unforgetable \\"bimbo\\" voice of hers.  As a musician, I find the commentaries by Julee Cruise and Angelo Badalamenti extremely informative.  Also, the Twin Peaks Convention features some remarkable look-alikes for \\"Agent Cooper\\" and \\"Maddie\\".  The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the audio and video tracks are slightly out of sync, giving a sense of being \\"dubbed\\".  I would hope that this problem could be remedied in a future edition.  Altogether, however, a real feast!!!   I've literally been waiting and hoping for this for years, as I didn't see all of the episodes when they were broadcast.
B000IAZ6W4|5.0|Bought this after seeing it on a couple of 'best of 2007' lists and couldn't be happier.  Have it in constant rotation and I discover a new favorite song on the album each time through.
B000EJ9MTW|3.0|Do you like classic rock but are sick to death of the same old songs played over and over on classic rock radio? If the answer is yes, then this record is for you. Wolfmother play straight up rock n' roll in the classic rock vein of Zeppelin and Sabbath, complete with cheesy Tolkian fantasy lyrics and a vocalist that sounds a bit like Rush's Geddy Lee. It's not really adventurous enough for my tastes, but it is very, very well done. This band is very good.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I have never seen Celine in concert, so I thought this might be a good way to come close to the experience and, boy, is that ever the truth!!  She definitely is a force of nature.  Not only her voice, but her persona fills the huge stage and the moments that she shares with her audience seem to be really heartfelt.  No wonder she connects so well with her devoted fans.  Her performance is breath-taking, as is the staging of the songs.  Some are better than others, but overall she absolutely owns this stage.  The extra DVD of Celine and the show cast and crew behind the scenes and of her visiting with some of her fans that have traveled across the globe to see her really brings home that she is indeed a \\"person\\" and not just a \\"personality\\".  I admire her a great deal and this DVD is a must for anyone who appreciates her style and talent.
B0002IU988|5.0|I picked up this cd and was totally blown away!  The guitar and vocals are second to none.  I can't even explain what Myles Kennedy's vocals do to reform the previous members of Creed into this new sensation called Alter Bridge.  I can only beg you to do yourself a favor and check out this cd, you won't be sorry.
B000YXMMAE|3.0|UPDATED TO FOUR STARS AFTER SEVEN MONTHS OF STAYING IN ROTATION!    It's hard not to have high expectations for a new Radiohead album--be they from the band's prior releases or the ever-increasing delay between them. When I first listened to In Rainbows, I was somewhat disappointed. As one of the more critical reviewer's put it, I came away with the impression of having just listened to Radiohead-lite. This was at work with nice, but somewhat bass-shy headphones. That evening I prepared my wife for dismay and put in the disc. Through my home system, my attention was instantly captured. There is a lot of great low bass on this album that wasn't coming through my headphones, unless, as I later discovered, I really cranked the volume. This recording deserves full range speakers or a decent subwoofer. Plus, headphones, as detail-revealing as they can be, don't convey the illusion of a wide soundstage like well placed stereo speakers or surround sound processing. There's a lot of reverb on this record that headphones don't do justice. In other words, when I first listened with bass-shy headphones at low to moderate volumes, In Rainbows faded into the background, but when played through my full range system at home, it came to life and pulled me in. This is really an amazing record. Ipod listening will make it sound bright and thin.     Over seven months, In Rainbows has forced its way into my life's soundtrack. I almost feel the NEED to listen to it. So many other reviewers have analyzed the music better than I could ever do. Yes, it's emotional: \\"Has the light gone out for you? 'Cause the light's gone out for me.\\" Yes, it's similar to other Radiohead material, and yes, it's different, too. Everyone will have a different response: for some it will become their favorite Radiohead album while others will keep spinning Ok Computer. I love the way In Rainbows synthesizes so much of Radiohead's prior choices into a new sound. Looking back on the band's catalogue, I feel I'vegrown up with Radiohead--from Creep to Reckoner has been quite a journey. This record just seems to speak to me where I now am in my life, just as Hail to Thief and most of the other records did. What's next, I wonder? I for one am excited to find out, but I'll be content with In Rainbows for quite a while.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|Having loved \\"One Day Remains\\", I anicipated \\"Blackbird\\" and was even more surprised at it's perfection!  Unbelievably tight and vocally wonderful!  It would be hard to pick a favorite, but I suppose the emotion that goes into Blackbird would be at the top of my list.  I can't wait to see them live.  Do yourself a favor and buy this cd, you won't be able to take it out of your cd player...

B000UJ48U4|3.0|It seems repeat viewings of EWS are essential, so I will note I've seen it three times; twice when it was released, and once last night in the unrated version. I am a devoted fan of Kubrick and his excellent films, but my objective side can't ignore the many problems that ultimately suffocate EWS and make it a lesser entry into his oeuvre. For every positive, EWS has two negatives.<br /><br />The cinematography is exquisite, elegant, and inspired. This film makes excellent use of a variety of lighting sources, playfully taking full advantage of Christmas lights and decorations of all sorts to create a galaxy of bright, colorful smears, orbs, and twinkles that form the backdrop for many of the more memorable interior scenes. The film has an overall warm glow in general, and a very natural feel that draws the viewer in for more. I could watch it on mute and be entranced.<br /><br />Yes it is distracting to see the former Mr. and Mrs. Tom Cruise, haltingly acting like a married couple up there on the screen. I did not find Kidman's performance to be laudable. Her take on being stoned came off as someone who was on valium, and her resulting shrewish tirade in which she lays out her plans for infidelity were both jarring and unbelievable. Of course, she could only do what the script allows, and her character was a flat one-note from the beginning, neglected for large portions of the film. Her actions (or non-actions) are central to the premise of the film, and yet I forgot she existed when she was off the screen. Cruise comes off better, slinking around town, brushing up against unsavory characters and wielding his \\"New York State Physician's Board\\" license as some sort of badge through which he is to be trusted. He plays it well as he is manipulated and taken advantage of, even as he uses his bloated self confidence to try and stay in control. Neither lead is sympathetic, but, again, the script doesn't allow them to be, and this is not unusual for a Kubrick film.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the story itself may be going somewhere, but it is moving very slowly, and we may not give a damn where it ends up once it gets there. It seems to be more about the journey, but this one is not particularly interesting. One notorious stopping point is the big \\"orgy scene\\", designed to represent a dark underbelly where people of influence do bad things (Sydney Pollack opines; \\"if you knew who they were, you wouldn't sleep well at night\\" in one of the films more wooden, poorly delivered lines). I hate to say it, but the scene illustrates perhaps what an elderly, conservative man would consider transgressive.  No, it does not titillate, and again that is much in line with sexual scenes in Kubrick's films (Alex DeLarge's romps in \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" come to mind).<br /><br />The production design is full of flaws. London streets do not make for NYC in December, especially when the props and staging are so clumsy. Yes it is ridiculous to see people carrying armloads of wrapped gifts through the streets as if they were in a community production of \\"Oliver Twist\\". The same blue mailbox, scrawled with graffiti, appears in multiple scenes on street corners, in front of the costume store, and in front of Nightingale's hotel. Curiously British phrasing appears on signs noting that establishments are \\"licensed\\". It doesn't look much like NYC at all, but I will admit it adds to the dreamlike character of action taking place in a sort of \\"Nowhere\\" within a dreamer's mind, so perhaps this was an intention (I am being generous).<br /><br />Clich&eacute;'s and easy plot avenues abound. A fey hotel worker is played for laughs as he rolls his eyes at beautiful Tom like a slightly updated Mr. Humphries. Multiple beautiful hookers have the requisite hearts of gold. Characters have lines like, \\"You need to leave! You have no idea the danger you're in!\\". The former Mrs. Cruise reappears in the denouement as Tom cries crocodile tears which are entirely unearned by either the character he is playing or the entire production in general. Emotions are displayed by the leads that are misplaced and not quite believable, unless one views them through the lens of the fractured marriage they quite possibly were experiencing in real life (as I said, it's distracting, even at the film's climax, such as it is). The ending ultimately seems lazy and smirking, as if Kubrick were extending a middle finger from beyond. I've read reviews by people who are no doubt very urbane and educated individuals who took their time to communicate their admiration for EWS. In my opinion, even though he often addressed deep issues and universal themes, Kubrick did so in what were ultimately populist films, enjoyed and cherished by many, many filmgoers. Without exception, every one of those films was tighter, more well written, more purposeful, and, ultimately, more rewarding than EWS. But oh it does have some of the most gorgeous camera work.ned by either the character he is playing or the entire production in general.

B00005JPTI|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Robert Neville is almost literally the last man left on Earth.  Through some bizarre fluke, he's one of only a handful of people with a natural immunity to a virus that, in less than three years time, has denuded the world of most of its human population.  Now, Neville, a renowned virologist himself, spends his days cruising the streets of a deserted Manhattan, and his nights hiding out from the infected cannibalistic mutants who venture forth only after dark (shades of \\"The Time Machine,\\" \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" and dozens of other similar films).<br /><br />\\"I Am Legend\\" is just the latest film version of the 1954 Richard Matheson novel that also served as the basis for 1971's \\"The Omega Man,\\" with Charlton Heston in the lead role.  Despite its occasional feeling of over-familiarity, \\"I Am Legend,\\" is a generally more subtle and thoughtful work than the average sci-fi film, one that, in addition to its more conventional action sequences and flesh-eating monsters, explores themes like survivors' guilt and the effect of prolonged isolation on the human psyche.  The movie, however, is clearly most notable for its remarkably convincing vision of a desolate, post-apocalyptic New York City, where weeds grow promiscuously through holes in the pavement and uninhabited buildings and idle cars serve as ghostly reminders of a civilization now gone from the scene (though one questions whether the place would really look quite this shoddy a mere three years after its abandonment).  Kudos to director Francis Lawrence and his crack team of visual and special effects artists for so successfully bringing this concept to life on screen.  For the most part, the thrills are nicely balanced with moments of tender sentiment, as Neville reflects back on the time he had with his late wife and daughter.<br /><br />In a role reminiscent of Tom Hanks' in \\"Cast Away,\\" Will Smith, largely bereft of any human companionship, spends most of the movie talking either to himself or to Sam, his loyal German Shepherd.  In this setup, Smith once again demonstrates that he is definitely a commanding presence on screen, keeping us interested even in those moments when not much is actually happening in the story.  For, there is, admittedly, a trifle more downtime in the movie than many of the more hardcore action fans would probably like.  That objection aside, however, \\"I Am Legend\\" provides enough food for thought and a sufficient number of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills to make it worth watching.l German Shepherd.

140120306X|3.0|It pains me to give this three stars- if there were a way to do 2.5 stars, that would be much more appropriate. If you like reading small cryptic type and don't happen to have VCR instructions around, this is the book for you. There were still interesting parts- mostly in the graphic portions of the book- but I suppose due to the vast expanses of written material between them, there was  very little flow to the story. If you think of the first League of Extraordinary Gentlemen as Star Wars, the second League as Empire Strikes Back, this one would be reading the credits to Return of the Jedi.
B000U55YIS|5.0|I first heard a couple of Baccara's songs on some compilations of European pop music a few years ago. Upon reading MediaControl's review of this collection, I decided to buy it, and I am very happy I did. MediaControl mentioned most of the most popular songs, but one absolutely wonderful surprise was \\"Boomerang\\" (on Disc 2), which is a delight for any Dixieland Jazz fan as I am. This set of 3 discs is a bargain at this price.

B00005QG9J|5.0|When \\"Morning View\\" was released in 2001, it seemed to get some flack for the fact that it was \\"to mellow\\" and the band had \\"sold out\\" due to the popularity of \\"Drive\\" off of \\"Make Yourself\\". NOW, it is true that the album has a bit more of a laid back sound, when you compare it to \\"S.C.I.E.N.C.E\\" but dont let the more laid back tone fool you, Its very dark, and my opinion is the dark sound, with the obvious \\"down tuning\\" of guitars gives it a very heavy feel. \\"Morning View\\" has a great feel to it, and it might be the most under-rated album in their catalog. If you have been hesitent to pick this up because of poor word of mouth, I really insist that you give it a listen, with an open mind, and you might find it dark and desparing, as I did.

Although I do not agree with everything in there, I will agree that it is a good book for somebody needing help with their business. It tells about how to have a system (think Mc Donalds) where you don't have to hire a perfect employee with lots of skill to do the work. But mearly somebody who can follow charts and directions. Which all of it I don't subscribe too, but there was lots of good advice to gleam from it.
0316166685|2.0|So many people told me this story would be dark & emotional & beautiful...<br />So many people told me I'd be turning the pages all night long...<br /><br />In the opening chapter of The Lovely Bones, Suzy Salmon is raped & slaughtered.<br />& yet somehow it wasn't grave nor potent nor heart-breaking, & I think I know why.<br />In between Suzy's moments with the to-be rapist, all these happy, sparkly memories are sprinkled. Oh, she likes Seventeen! Oh, she likes science! Oh yes! How very ominous! & during the actual rape--the ultimate crime against soul--what we are given is a mild, mild description of this should-be scarring event, void of fear, void of loss, & I could feel no emotion for this girl.<br />& after this all we are handed is melodramatic family soap-opera slop.

Sebold literally ignores Susan's rape & it baffles me. & even Susan's feelings towards her murder are bland, weak: inhuman. It's all about her family.

Sex shouldn't come so easily. Not to mention that Susan thoughtlessly & quite disturbingly roofies her unknowing earth-bound friend in doing so...<br />So much intercourse that's completely out-of-place.

0143038419|1.0|My sister and I saw the author being interviewed on the Oprah show. Well...I purchased the book for my sister, who can be quite a bit more open-minded than I about things in this world. MUCH to my surprise, she was not impressed at all. Whether you are a Christian or just someone who is in search of Truth, don't be fooled by the word \\"pray\\" or the holes that were left on Oprah's show. It is DEEPLY \\"New-Age\\" and though I know that it is \\"One Woman's Journey\\"...it is still very one-sided on the political front. I truly was shoked by my sister's review of this book and the excerpts that were read and shown to myself, but also so very thankful that she didn't buy into the many false teachings that it contains.
B000022TSV|5.0|This is an absolutely must have for any lovers of the opera Carmen. I originally purchased it as a VHS recording and have tried for years to locate it on DVD. The DVD version is rare indeed and the high cost (I paid $134.77) is worth every penny. The sound is highly superior to the VHS version though mine may have been played so long it sound has been affected. It was purchased from a video store. This presentation of the opera is shown as a movie. It contains close-ups not possible in a stage presentation and it shows villages, buildings, huge crowds, dust, actual bull fighting and many scenes totally impossible with a stage production. Also, the opera is intact. Nothing has been changed. Domingo and Migenes are excellent as are all the cast. A finer version of the opera is simply not possible.
630460291X|2.0|This is a really, really dull, boring, ultimately pointless film.  As many here have said, it's a revisionist Robin Hood, and it's a revisionist bore.  Here Kevin Costner portrays Robin Hood as a \\"good guy trying to do the right thing\\", not as a flamboyant, larger than life character, like he was in the Errol Flynn version.  Costner is particularly lifeless here, with an accent (as many have noted) that comes and goes.  It's either his real voice or a really bad English accent, and both are in the film, which is a textbook example of sloppy filmmaking.  The only character full of life is Alan Rickman's Sheriff of Nottingham.  He's so over the top you end up liking him more than Costner's stiff Robin Hood.  The film is directed rather stodgily by Kevin Reyonlds, director of the infamous Waterworld (which is a little more interesting than this film).<br /><br />The point of Robin Hood was that he is larger than life, he's not a \\"good guy\\".  You're supposed to cheer and adore him (like many did with Errol Flynn), not say \\"he's nice, and he's doing his best\\".  Robin Hood is not a regular sort of bloke, he's a flamboyant, cascading man.  I know I sound corny, but I would take a flamboyant Errol Flynn over Costner's deliberately dulled down portrayal here.  Even PC friendly additions of women to the merry men and a stronger, more decisive Marian don't make the film any better or worse.  It's almost like they said \\"let's make it as bland as oatmeal\\", except someone forgot to tell Alan Rickman, but that's OK.  I'm giving the film 2 stars because of him.  A really disappointing film...

B000MRAAJM|5.0|A truly amazing series!! I don't quite buy into the, 'look how fragile it is, we're going to kill it' angle but it's still amazing. To me, it shows how truly resilient our planet is and how insignificant we really are in the scheme of things.  They do seem to keep the propoganda at a minimum which is also a plus!<br /><br />This is a high-def must-have.  The shots are amazing, the quality is awesome.  There are even little story lines throughout each one as they follow an animal or an animal family!

B000002BBY|5.0|A weirdly oldschool tenderly savagely brilliant compilation.  Full of sound and fury, signifying much.  Hard fast paced rock laced with the courtliness and poetical humility of a medieval troubador.  Punk with roots.   And it reaches down like the roots of an ancient cypress, comprehensive, plaintive, eternal.  Youth looking back with wonder, restraint, and yes, a little anger.  The power of the amplified music is overpowered by the quiet fury, surrender, and sensitivity of this biographical odyssey in sound.  Reminds me of the British royalty of old, combined with a hefty dose of the British invasion rockers (good poets borrow, great poets steal!), and a covering of modern punk rock.

The whole epidemic is explained and is quite believable.<br />If you like books about heroes, or deep character development you are in the wrong place. This book is all about the world as a whole. This is the only problem I had with the book is that I got to like the stories of some people and wanted to hear more. Some characters seem to have a very interesting story to tell but are cut short.<br />In short, read this book if you like zombies.
B0000025D0|5.0|A truly spectacular rock and roll opus.  Under-hyped and understated, Darkness was released in the penumbra of 1975's excellent Born to Run.  Strikingly different in tone, this record surpasses BTR in its clarity and depth of feeling.  Each song is unique, with its own particular hook, but complex enough to elicit the desire for multiple listenings.    One the regrets of my youth was not catching the tour following this record's release (although I have been fortunate enough to hear many of its songs in subsequent live performances).  Caution to aging teeny-boppers, Gen x, y, z `ers: there is no top 40 material here!    Rolling Stone ranked Darkness at 151 in its widely publicized Greatest 500 Albums of All Time.  I would place it in the top 10, very likely in the top five.  Thirty years later, I have the cd, in my car, often played - those lyrics, that voice and guitar still work for me!
B0000067L4|2.0|The live cuts here seem just a little out of kilter, a little out of tune, a little tired ... they were together slightly more than two years - but in that time period it was near-nonstop touring, and the insanity of life under a microscope as they achieved rock immortality. It must have been exhausting (the photo on the cover says it all). The studio cuts seems like after thoughts.    (any other band would rate 4 stars if they put out music like this)
B000YIGNKE|1.0|Having seen the 1995 version and read the book, I thought this version would be worthy and even taped it! Was I ever wrong! If you've read the book, which I highly recommend, and see the 1995 movie, then you would see everything wrong with this drivel! I was disappointed. I suppose the casting and costumes were acceptable, but no where in the book does Anne go off and pour out her heart into some journal like some forlorn teenager. And I don't recall her being a clutz either. I don't remember her tripping in the book. In the book and in the 1995 version which got it right the first time, Anne is strong, capable, and more than worthy of any man's affection. In this one she comes off as a pathetic old maid pining away for her man. Of course, I missed the part where Frederick is writing her the letter and hands it her. Where's the swoon value in taking it out? The climax is that letter. It's a love letter to her. She's running around like some celebrity stalker chasing after him and is so out of breath I expected her to collapse at any moment. I hated this! I wouldn't waste my money on it. There's no hateful sister who would rather leave her sister to walk in the rain, nor is her snobbish buffoon of a father who is played by Anthony Head. I kept expecting Buffy to leap out at any moment. I'm not a purist, but I do like faithful adaptations of a great book. Even Louisa's fall from the wall is kept out. It's shortened here and reveals nothing about Louisa's character. I recommend the 1995 version. It's as faithful to Anne as you can get and who can forget the ending where he takes her with him on his next voyage and they sail off into the sunset? This one he buys her the house and that's that. It's a very cold and empty version. I thought Masterpiece theater could have done much better. Tape it, don't buy it. Read the book and buy the 1995 BBC version. It's stunning!

B000PY52EU|5.0|***** 2006. Written and directed by Craig Brewer. An aging and religious bluesman decides to reform a wild young woman and chains her in his house. It's been a long time I haven't been so enthralled by a recent movie. Christina Ricci's performance is superior, the concert scene is exceptional and the snake metaphor a brilliant idea. Highly recommended.

Every single song is great, but my favorites are: Traffic in the Sky, Gone, Rodeo Clowns, Cocoon, Cookie Jar, and Mediocre Bad Guys. I love the mellow, chilled out, beachy vibe that's present in all of his music. I can't wait to buy his next album.

B000YA9R3C|5.0|This was such an awesome film! It really explores the darker side of humanity, and does it as good as any other film that I have seen in a while. Daniel Day Lewis brings down the house as a self proclaimed \\"oil man\\" whose heart is blacker than the oil that he drills. Here is a man that, over the years, has been consumed by hatred and greed. He has mastered the art of manipulation, and he's not shy to admit it.     Paul Dano is equally impressive as the shady young pastor, who uses God as a way to gain financial profit. He is incredibly creepy...you just have to see the first church scene. It's sort of funny and disturbing at the same time.     I have the feeling that some reviewers and audience members were mislead into thinking that this is some kind of horror film. It is not, although the score is undeniably unsettling for a film of this type - it's brilliant, by the way. Others have thought that it was boring and drawn out. I simply do not understand this. It seems that the majority of people have forgotten what good storytelling feels like. In order to let the story flourish, you need lots of time. You can't just wrap EVERYTHING up in 90 minutes and call it a day. Okay. I'll get off of my soapbox, but only because I only have a limited number of words that I can type in this review.     Paul Thomas Anderson deserves his Oscar already. I've loved every film that he has made so far, and this one is no exception. I will be seeing this again, and buying the DVD when it comes out. This has definitely been added to my favorite films list, and it IS one of the best films of the year, alongside \\"Sweeney Todd\\", \\"Atonement\\", \\"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead\\" and \\"Juno\\".     SEE IT.

I read this book in 2 nights. I loved it! It is compelling to see how someone can work through their demons and inner most issues. I would suggest this to anyone that aren't offended by the Crue! I hope life is treating him well now!
B000QYBB6M|5.0|This series of books is about a Botswanan Lady Detective. They are very well written and entertaining. You can read them in a day. You will be hooked after the first one. AMS makes his characters come to life. You will be enchanted with Botswana and feel you have been there.    Excellent to pass around to friends. Please keep them coming!!

6301976622|5.0|\\"Quo Vadis\\" is one of my favorite films.  The whole picture has the feel of a Hollywood epic with thousands of extras and lots of spectacle.  The scene where Romes burns and the victory parade of Roman legions were quite memoriable.  Deborah Kerr, Finlay Curie (Peter), and Leo Genn give good acting performances.  Peter Ustinov's performance as Nero is a little over the top, but is never the less entertaining and memorable.  The picture is greatly enhanced in the fact it was filmed around Rome.  The scenes of Christians being persecuted are significantly toned down from the book but are still powerful.   Overall, while not quite as good as the book, the film is a very entertaining epic dealing with love, faith, persecution, and the madness of an emperor.  I hope this film will be released on a high quality DVD soon.    I don't usually like to comment on other reviewers' opinions, but in the name of honesty, I believe a previous reviewer is really blowing Peter and Paul disagreements out of proportion.  I don't exactly know where he arrived at his information, but it would appear to be from radical theological persuasions rather than mainstream views.

What is amazing about this cd is that you can listen to it without even wanting to skip ahead to another song, it is strong all the way through. My favorite song is \\"In the Garage\\" which is simply classic, buy this cd now!!!

I actually had to ration that book, so that I would not finish it in a day. I would read 50 pages a day and forcibly keep the rest.

1593080255|4.0|The Story:<br /><br />Dorian Gray is an adonis who is reminded or rather made attentive to his own beauty by a gentle artist friend (or lover) of his, Basil Hallward, who makes a breathtaking portrait of Gray. The portrait eventually becomes a favorite with Dorian, which also mirrors, in its painted face a sombre reflection of his own misdeeds and immoralities -- each time he commits it -- by growing uglier and uglier. He guards it with extreme care and caution everyday wanting none to see it found marred by his iniquities. Early in the story Dorian happens to meet with a reckless rich man, Lord Henry, a friend of Basil, who cares not a tithe for morality and its dull unattractive ways but believes in living life to the fullest at any cost. He preaches hedonism as sacred and purity a sin. Both Lord Henry and Dorian take an instant liking towards each other the day they meet. This friendship has an obvious deleterious effect on Dorian in that he kills himself repentantly after realising the worthlessness of his having lived a pompous, immoral, wicked and greedy life. Just before the story ends, he kills his well-wisher Basil too.<br /><br />How the story is arranged:<br /><br />Initially, the first few chapters seem to move fast and the story gains momentum. Just as the reader becomes inquisitive, a dull tone appears making the following chapters languorous. Wilde becomes a bit didactic in elaborating on the various interests Dorian picks on in his later adult life. Also, as one naturally imagines Dorian as a young lad, we then suddenly find him a thirties something in the last few chapters without a clear and smooth manifestation of this transition from adolescence to manhood. Most of Dorian's life is sinfully adventurous and in spite of that is portrayed quite uninterestingly. No events are specifically narrated upon and the emphasis on homosexuality can be smoothly sidelined. Overall, the story is good only if viewed as a philosophical inquest into human nature. Anything beyond that may disappoint the reader.<br /><br />Relevance, Reflections and Conclusion:<br /><br />The entire story is a narration of essentially how importantly one's mind makes one's personality, how one's personality makes one's deeds, and how in turn those deeds make one's soul. Of course we do not really fashion our soul, we only help it manifest it through our deeds. Gray's character is a reflection of the kind of narcissist weaklings in humanity who lack the courage to face their dark corners, while constantly finding strength and support in being mentored (actually misled) by feckless perverse people, like Lord Henry here, who lead them increasingly towards moral obscurity. How different the world would be if each one of us could reason out \\"responsibly\\" all that seems perverse and sacred, and yet not give in to anything perverse or sacred until one has found it true himself! I have also found the concept of blame game in this story very interesting. Do we not often dutifully blame others for our own darkness and failures, just as Dorian Gray blames his friend Basil Hallward for turning him into a deplorable narcissist? A responsible man always shares the burden of his own actions, rather than carelessly and callously point fingers at others -- a good lesson to learn! The story also raises deep philosophical arguments at every nook and corner if one plunges deep into the characters of the story attentively. Simple sentences like \\"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing\\" had me thinking and I found it strongly relevant in today's consumeristic hegemony. There are many more such dialogues which raise questions about the importance of femininity, marriage, purity, aestheticism and so on. Anyhow, to read it for its \\"own sake\\", or to try to finish it in a hurry, will certainly make it very boring and tiresome. But for those who inveterately love to question and investigate the world they live in with its various dogmas, theologies, philosophies and doctrines either propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read. Since I do not possess a bent of mind that appreciates a tragic ending,  -- I consider human life very precious --, I was sorely disappointed to see the protagonist, Dorian Gray, dead in the end. In fact I find this style of defeatist writing/ending a flaw in itself though it appeals to many. Plainly, if I were the author, I would have given my protagonist a new life, a new philosophy, a new guidance, and a new hope. HOPE...without which the entire humanity cannot exist.her propagating or thrashing morality, this book makes an interesting read.

And borderline unrealistic. And downright predictable. I had the entire plot figured out around page 30, but I didn't think I was actually going to be THAT right.     Don't get me wrong, I'm touched at the thought that a middle class, two parent, suburban WASP-y family has enough money, time and resources (did I mention money?) to genetically design a baby to be born just to save the life of another. But that's only what...15% of the American population? 1% of the world? If you don't fall into that perfect little category, your child is probably screwed.    Oh, and just to add to the STAGGERING errors Ms. Picoult made: minors cannot pawn property. It's a felony. So sayeth this former pawnbroker. (I'm also a former paralegal, but I won't go there.)

But, after just getting this cd I find out there was a limited edition with a bonus song (that's supposed to be pretty good.  It's called \\"Cold.\\")  Anyway, I'm giving the cd 4 stars because I'm bugged that I bought a brand new album that doesn't come with all the new songs.  i.e. If you want the bonus song you have to go for the gimmick of a limited edition album, (which didn't seem to be even available here in the U.S.)    grrrr.....
1400064287|5.0|Just when you thought that you understood how to write the best copy for marketing communications ... along come Chip and Dan Heath with a terrific new book.    Made to Stick is a New York Times bestseller. That's because the authors have figured out how to create \\"sticky\\" messages -- the ones that make you take a second look and remember what the point of the message is. And they've presented their findings in a breezy, well-organized style that helps their message stick!    Think about the ads and ideas you remember, and discover how that info was communicated. Southwest is the 'Low Fare Airline.' Nordstrom provides 'outstanding customer service.' And some \\"sticky stories\\" that you remember that aren't even true. What about the Kentucky Fried Rat (never happened) or the Great Wall of China being visible from outer space (sorry, not so!).    Now you can replicate success by following the authors' 6 principles.

0321525655|5.0|Like everyone else that reviewed this book, I found it to be superb. Not only the ideas; but the presentation, examples, and resources provided make it a must-read. My only criticism is that the author includes what I believe to be a disproportionate quantity of presentation material that highlights how overweight we are in the US - I don't need a lecture about my weight from another crunchy ex-pat, even if it is indirect. Sometimes zen comes from being happy with who you are and not subscribing to what others want us to be.

But it retains the chatty, discoursive style of its predecessor, and is a fantastic read.    Its thesis concerns Black Swans, which he describes as the highly improbable but highly consequential event. He argues that Black Swans prop up with some frequency and yet we're always staggered when faced by them. And theres some interesting discussion on why we couldnt, by definition, prep for them, even if we were inclined to.
B000YIGNKE|1.0|I tried to watch the latest version of Persuasion without thinking about the book or the 1995 movie when it came on PBS this past weekend. My comments are based upon the notes I took.   The actress who plays Ann has two expressions; a rare smile and this slack-jawed, vacant-eyed look that indicates all other feelings.   Who casted these actors? Brother in law Charles looks older than his parents. Elizabeth looks too old to be her father's daughter. CPT. Wentworth's sister and brother in law look old enough to be his parents. Mary is demented. CPT Wentworth is good. Am I supposed to believe he is carrying a torch for that slack-jawed little mouse. The Admiral does not act like one. (I am a retired military officer and believe me the British are officers to the grave and beyond)   Mrs. Smith is so ill that she has to hire a nurse to give her care but she is well enough to walk over to Ann's house to give her a message.    Brought up in this terribly restrictive society, Ann runs out, without a hat, to try and find CPT. Wentworth.She goes on this chase (think 3 Stooges) OOOPs you just missed him, try there, ooops missed him again, keep going. What they could have done was to add a person at every stop so that there could have been a line of people following Ann to emphasize that this is supposed to be a farce.   My notes weren't very complete because about 15 minutes into the movie I picked up some handiwork and didn't pay full attention to it. I kept it on because PBS had been advertising this for months and I kept thinking, but Hollywood didn't make this, it has to get better. It didn't. Do yourself a favor and buy the 95 version with Amanda Roote as Ann.

6305090564|3.0|\\"Deep Rising\\" is a kind of action/horror film that you watch on midnight TV. You may not be particularly impressed with the impossible story, but you keep watching because anyway it keeps entertaining in its own way. It is not the greatest horror film in the movie history, but is not the worst either. Director is Stephen Sommers, the guy responsible for much better \\"The Mummy.\\"    Treat Williams is an adventurer hired by the group of the pirates led by Wes Studi. Their target is a luxury ocean liner which is just attacked by a man-eating creature(s?) with huge tentacles. It is a typical B-movie premise (though the effects are superb), but it is fun nonetheless. Listen to Treat William's character repeatedly say with a self-mocking tone \\"Now what?\\" and we all know that we are not supposed to take the film seriously.     \\"Deep Rising\\" understands the rules of monster flicks: they need beautiful ladies and some occasional comic touch if possible. Famke Janssen is the beauty and Kevin J. O'Connor provides laughs. The film also includes the supports like Djimon Hounsou, Jason Flemyng and Cliff Curtis, but don't expect character development or something like that. You just don't have one - the good is always good while the bad is always bad - and all that is intentional.    I have seen the film in theater about 10 years ago. Then I was not impressed very much (though not disappointed either). Since then I have seen it several times and I started to like it more. It is cheesy fun certainly, but it is still fun.

B000CE9R26|3.0|I am a great Donna fan, but this is not one of Summer's more memorable works. The album is well produced by Michael Omartian but lacks the timeless songs and gripping melodies that are found aplenty on her better albums.<br /><br />There Goes My Baby is a pleasant ballad where her voice gets a chance to soar, but most of the tracks sound very similar. The style is a kind of 80's Pop/R&B without the dance beat. The torch song Forgive Me has lovely piano and the title track is vaguely sensual, while the opening number Supernatural Love is embellished with impressive synth infusions.<br /><br />But overall, the album is rather tepid and lacks spark. It is with a measure of reluctance that I award it a third star. Perhaps it deserves only two and a half. I recommend the albums [[ASIN:B00009U5J5 Bad Girls]] and [[ASIN:B000001FEE Once Upon a Time]] to those wishing to hear Donna Summer at her peak.

0446577391|2.0|All prior and favorable reviews notwithstanding, likewise previous novels from Baldacci, the novel \\"Stone Cold\\" appears to be, as my review title implies, a collection of characters incredibly mismatched to perform an even more incredible story. There is no logical thread between the two main themes of the novel, the con and the betrayal, and even less of a credible thread between the characters other than one hastily contrived in order to produce a novel of over three hundred pages. In fact, the book reads as though there had not been an outline; i.e., the author made up each chapter as he went along, perhaps between cups of coffee.
0141439688|2.0|When I saw Masterpiece Theater was doing a series on Jane Austen and her novels, I decided to read them in the order the shows would air--starting with Persuasion.  It was the first and last of Austen's that I will read. She may well have captured the mores and social rules of the time, but she didn't create characters I could really care about.  I stuck with it to the end and found the revelations about Mr. Elliot to come out of nowhere and the ending romance to be something we could see coming from the very start.  I'll take Edith Wharton over Austen any day.
0807262013|5.0|Now that I've listened to all three CDs, I must say that Pullman's reading and the many well chosen voices for this set, had me enthralled all the way through.  In Amber Spyglass, the story becomes much more complex. The enormous themes, introduced in the earlier books, are resolved, with a few exceptions, very well. I'm awed that the author had the courage to address such huge themes.  Science, creativity, freethought play out against religious obedience, mysticism, and control.<br /><br />This story incorporates plenty of supernatural fantasy and SiFi, as it deals with religious, scientific, philosophical themes that are addressed in Christianity and the Bible. These are the questions that all humans puzzle over.....\\"What is the purpose of my Life?\\", \\"Where do I go when I die?\\", \\"How shall I live?\\"  Yet, underneath the fantasy of Spyglass is a naturalistic, humanistic world view that satisfies morality, beauty, and the creative human mind as well....and possibly better... than religious dogma ever has.

I like authors to tease me along until much later in the book than The Outlook does.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that the plot clearly points to what the ultimate conclusion is.  Those clues when buried in a serial don't stick out so much because you forget them by the next day.  Sit down and read them at one time (as I did on a plane flight), and they point irresistibly away from what the main investigation is presuming.  As a result, the book's ending was totally predictable.<br /><br />I found another problem with the book.  The guilty parties make a ridiculously stupid mistake in how they handle the radioactive material.  These aren't hop heads.  Without that mistake, the mystery wouldn't have been resolved in the way it was.  It looks like Michael Connelly took an illegal short-cut here that damaged his story.  Too bad.

B000YIGNKE|3.0|If I hadn't seen the 1995 BBC production of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Claran Hines, I would have enjoyed this endeavor better.  However, between the two, the 1995 production is a much better movie.     The first time I saw either production was on Masterpiece Theatre.  Although I purchased the 1995 version mentioned above right after seeing it, and have enjoying watching it many times, I am not planning on buying this version.  Don't get me wrong, this movie is also good and many will enjoy it.  I just like the portrayal of the characters in the Amanda Root and Claran Hines production better.
B00005JLCI|4.0|This is a very well-directed film. The great joy of watching a Branagh-directed Shakespeare is the effort put into ensuring that the diction is as clear and natural as possible without losing the strength of the text. The cast is excellent, Derek Jacobi and Kate Winslet in particular; even cameos for which you would perhaps have doubts - such as Robin Williams, who impresses with his characterisation of Osric, and Billy Crystal as the gravedigger - work. Indeed, the repartee between Billy Crystal and Simon Russell-Beale in the graveyard scene is the funniest I have ever witnessed.    The colour and sets are spectacular, all filmed in 70mm, allowing for great richness and definition. Branagh says he wanted to escape the Gothic look of previous Hamlets, \\"away from the clichés of doublet and hose\\", so instead Elsinore becomes Blenheim in the nineteenth century. Almost everyone wears glitteringly smart military dress, for it is, after all, a time of war. It's also winter, although the effect is somewhat undermined by the lack of cold air on the breaths of the protagonists. Branagh wanted the look to be sexy and glamorous. He says he wanted, rather than a portrayal of an exact period, more an impression of period. He mentions the Austro-Hungarian Empire and claims the films \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" and \\"Mayerling\\" as influences.     The interior shots were made at Shepperton Studios. Here all is light and brightness, with a focus on the mirrored hall. There are some very long and impressive takes, but you become so engrossed in the action that you barely notice these. I only became aware of them when listening to the interesting commentary by Branagh and Shakespearian scholar and collaborator, Russell Jackson. It is well worth listening to, commenting as it does on both the philosophy and the practicalities behind both the original play and on the filmed production.     This film is long because it includes, more or less, the whole play. There have been some shavings; asmentioned in the commentary, Branagh has kept to the first folio and second quarto editions, so we do not see the scene of Gertrude being informed of Hamlet's return from England that is in the first quarto. The play itself, despite its length, is to some extent made worse by missing scenes, for example where Laertes is told of his father's murder and sister's madness, and draws together his mob to attack the palace. It would have been nice too to have seen how Hamlet returns to Denmark. Branagh tries to provide a detailed backdrop by, for instance, showing him making love to Ophelia, and by the use of cameos such as those of John Gielgud and Judi Dench, so perhaps I should not be too complaining.    It has an intermission between discs but the time passes quite unnoticed as you become involved in the drama, as when Laertes and Claudius conspire Hamlet's death. Indeed, I would say that Claudius is the key to this performance, and Jacobi (for once) is formidable in the role. Claudius now has time to be seen as a more well-rounded character. He is not a purely evil man, and Branagh in his commentary describes him as a \\"good man gone bad\\". This means that Hamlet is not so much the solution, but he is the problem to the play, for when he kills Polonius does not he become just as much the murderer as Claudius?    But what of Branagh's portrayal of Hamlet itself? It feels mean of me to criticise a man who has seemingly devoted half his life to the Shakespearian cause, but Branagh's Hamlet in his ravings and rantings in his soliloquies goes over the top. For me, Branagh's rages are seen as overacting, as not true. (Laertes too - played by Michael Moloney - tends to overplay his wrath, but, in a sense, he is Hamlet's mirrored self.) The worst scene in the entire play - just before the intermission - sees Hamlet raging against the universe, and set falsely against a vast winter landscape where Fortinbras's soldiers march across a plain. It is too full of hubris. If Hamlet is the Renaissance man that Branagh claims him to be, then where is his self-control, his healthy scepticism, his calm reasoning? I prefer him not to rage but to be more introverted; more moody; more in touch with his true self; cooler, calmer and more collected. Rage does not suit Hamlet, and it most certainly does not suit Branagh's hamlet.    Having said that, when Hamlet is in company, Branagh is excellent, almost faultless. He is suave, he is playful, he is comic, and he mad. But in all these scenes he is credible. His relationship with Kate Winslet as Ophelia is electric, and the interaction with his mother and uncle profoundly realistic. By the way, in this film Branagh has assumed that Gertrude does not know that the drink intended for Hamlet has been poisoned.    Some things do not work, such as Patrick Doyle's too-sweet score. The ghostly statue of Hamlet's father that is seen to move at the commencement of the play is also lacking, for he is just not scary at all. It is a wooden performance (literally?), for the camerawork here clearly does not portray the statue as great or as frightening as the film pretends him to be; the result is that the awed speeches surrounding the statue's movement are a little ridiculous, because we do not share the fear of the witnesses. On the other hand, Brian Blessed's later reprise of the role of the ghost in the woodland scene does indeed scare, with his whispered incantation and his glowingly dead eyes. It would have been, perhaps, an interesting idea in this scene to have compared Hamlet exuding cold breath from his mouth in the cold night air with the ghost's very lack of breath.    But at the end of the day, after four hours of intense drama, I felt somehow unmoved. Was it because I was numb? Or was the fault to do with the play itself? Is the ending too contrived for this post-Enlightenment viewer? Why did Shakespeare believe that his audience would be persuaded that Claudius would go to such lengths as to create a final fencing match to kill Hamlet, when he had the means to remove him more covertly, just as he had done to Hamlet's father? For me, Hamlet is a wonderful play ruined by the need for ends to be tied-up neatly at the close of the curtain. But as for this film version, there is so much wrong, and yet far more that is so right. I have yet to see a better filmed version.

It's difficult to advise a complaining parent that it's up to them to change the environment at home, if anything I'm doing is going to help their child. I recommend all my parents read this book, and the children too, if they choose to, however, it's essential for parents !     I have also recommended it to teachers I've met...wherever we can help young minds grow in a way that opens their learning systems and allows them to be the creative beings they can be, then I feel we've taken one more step towards the future of this planet.    I've had to buy many books now, because I keep giving them to my parents.  Now I just send them the AMAZON link and check they have ordered and are reading it!    Thanks, Dr. Dweck, this is outstanding work, simple to read, easy to relate to, and makes it's so easy for parents to adjust their own mindset.

B00005JPTI|3.0|Watching its trailer made me curious about the movie. And the title... wow, it speaks so loud, daring. There must be something here I thought.    Well, first few minutes, I was entertained to see NY becoming a jungle. No people, cars just parked, overgrown by weeds. What a sight. Right until the lone man found something disturbing....    Since my partner loves RE (and I was forced to watch obviously), I could not help to compare the 2 movies. I think this movie is similar to RE and there was just nothing new. I also think the director didn't think of the ending scene very much. Listening to its description, I was imagining a totally different kind of place.    Well, it still offers a great sight to the destruction of civilization as we know it but it just doesn't fit the title.
B00003CXWV|5.0|So what makes a movie great is what I often ask myself and I can't put my finger on it but there is something in this movie that puts it in this category.  I'm not a huge fan of the subject material, or Johhny Depp for that matter, nor did I know a lot about the whole drug culture.  It didn't matter though because this movie is unreal.  It's just plain cool.  It is just so engaging that you are riveted from the time it starts to the moment it ends.  Kind of surprised why this movie did not get better reviews because I honestly don't see anything really wrong with it.
1593080255|1.0|Wow...I had been under the impression prior to reading the novel that this was one of the great works of Western Literature in the past 200 or so years...Never have I been so dissapointed.  While full of wonderful quotes that sound great over a dinner discussion, a noteworthy tale this is not.  Wilde seems far more interested in catologing lists of inane objects and people than he is of entertaining or interesting the reader.  Wilde only glosses over Gray's sinful actions letting us know sparse details about his supposed debauchery but never exposing the reader to them...So a woman kills herself over being jilted, so he uses opium, so he goes to prostitutes, so he is bisexual...Who cares??  Such a shallow character (and this book is filled with shallow, undeveloped characters) is impossible to care one way or another about...So when the end of the book comes to its obvious conclusion as a reader I simply shut the book, pondered what all the fuss and bother has been about and put the book on Ebay as its not worth taking up space on my bookshelf...

B000051VWW|4.0|I've been listening to Sade since her debut and she never ceases to amaze me with wonderful vocals.  From start to finish, each of her CD's tells a series of stories that anyone who's been in love can relate to.  Her voice captures all those emotions and lulls you into that 'special' place in your heart.  Sade will always be a part of my music collection.
B000VWYJ86|4.0|This final film in the Bourne trilogy, once again follows the amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne as he begins to regain his memories and learn of his past. Meanwhile, the CIA still keeps coming, and as Bourne tries to stay one step ahead of them, he begins to learn just who he was and uncovers corrupt agents and illegal top secret government projects. Once again, some important characters reprise their roles (Joan Allen, Julia Styles), and a few more characters are added, with David Strathairn doing a great job in the role of Noah Vose, and excellent Scott Glenn, but unfortunately he's only in a handful of scenes. As far as story, its pretty much on par with the previous two films. Again, the pacing is very high, in fact, perhaps a little too high in this one. Once again, Paul Greengrass was in the director's chair, and there's more shaky camera work throughout. Again, this camera work didn't bother me as much as it does others. Actually, the editing might've been a bit too much, it does seem to get a little choppy sometimes, especially during some of the action sequences, where its hard to really focus on what's going on cause you don't have much time in-between cuts to clearly seeing what exactly is happening. But this is nothing really major, as far as I'm concerned. But one thing that did kinda bug me about this film was the almost non-stop use of ridiculous technology  in the story. Can the CIA really all that crap they do in the film?! Like tracing and tapping all the damn cell phones in the whole world, and having tons of agents posted in apparently every major city, in every country on earth, all ready to chase some guy on a moments notice? Not only can they do this, could they do it as quickly as they do here?!If this is the case, then thats just plain scary! But as far as Hollywood goes, I just don't buy all of it. I know, this CIA  surveillance stuff has been in all of these films, but I in this case, I think they may have went overboard with it in this film. There are also a couple of action sequence stunts that I didn't quite buy into either. I also would like to mention, that though this SHOULD be the last Bourne film, since these films were based on 3 books by Robert Ludlum. but they did leave this film open for another sequel. However, I think that another sequel would be a bad idea. Its better to quit while you're ahead, but knowing Hollywood, they'll probably milk this series as much as they can. In closing, I think this installment is the weakest in the Bourne Trilogy. But I'm not saying its a bad film, and its most definitely worth watching and owning. Basically, if you've liked this series so far, you should enjoy this one as well.. There are also a couple of action sequence stunts that I didn't quite buy into either.

0767906543|5.0|I've never written a book review before but this book definitely deserves a fantastic one.  Mike Gayle's style is completely witty (I ended up highlighting some sentences), and though my intension was not to learn about the male regarding relationships, I no doubt came out a little bit more informed. Although this book can be classified in the same category as the Shopaholic and other Blonde-something books (can't even remember the titles now), this book has more style and the characters are very realistic.     I now plan on reading ALL his books.  Bravo.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This being the second installment of the trilogy of Bourne films, this movie is pretty much a continuation of the first film. The story takes place about 2 years after the end of the first movie, where we find Jason Bourne trying to have a life of his own, but when he subquently gets dragged back into danger, the chase is on, and Bourne is out to find his own kind of justice, and once again trying to find who he is. Of course, new characters are introduced, this time its Pam Landy (played by Joan Allen) who is trying to chase down Bourne, and new twists and turns in the story begin to unfold. Much like the first film, what makes this film the most entertaining is the pacing. There's not a lot of dull parts here, and the chase scenes are pretty good. Though there are some complaints about the shaking hand-held camera work during some these scenes, some say it makes the film more real and gritty. For me, the camera work didn't bother that much, but I could understand how some may not like it. I really don't have anything that negative to say about the film. The acting, the story, and the editing are all good. As far as being better that The Bourne Identity, well..it's close, but not quite. But if you liked the The Bourne Identity, there's really no good reason why you wouldn't enjoy this one.
1582701709|1.0|I got this book as a gift so I'm glad I did not waste my own money to buy it! I've never written a review until this book came along. I am a voracious reader so I feel I need to warn people about this book.  This book's message is totally absurd -  so unrealistic, impractical and irresponsible - more like an approach  to some vodoo magic or hocus-pocus to make life rich, free of sickness, free of disasters, etc! Get real. We need a realistic and practical guide to things, not by means of some black art or magic that this book relentlessly pursued. Are we supposed to just \\"think it\\" and everything will come to us? What happened to \\"hard work\\"?    I can't help but to think that the author's intention was to fool  people in order to make money! And I'm sure she did. That is so obscene.  Please dear readers, do yourselves a favor - don't buy this book, you will thank me for it.

B000YENUI6|3.0|Any fan of actor Viggo Mortensen expects by now to see him in a role of a silent, calm and reluctant hero.  \\"Eastern Promises\\" features Mortensen in a role of a Russian mafia member posing as a driver on the errands that often include murders.  We also encounter Naomi Watts in a role of a midwife who accidentaly comes across young Russian born teenage mother upon whose childbirth death, our midwife is determined to find newborn child's family in order to avoid having baby sent to the foster child care. The unlikely acquiantance between these two characters and their secret desires (midwife longs for a baby, while our good-hearted thug wants the reigns of Russian underground in London) puts them on a path of violence that is the only way for them to get what they want.  This is graphic film with a lot of \\"icky\\" scenes - throat cutting, cord cutting of a new baby, finger cutting and some flesh slicing in a Turkish bath as our naked main protagonist is fighting for his dear life against Kurdish thugs.  Unsentimental, raw but honest film about damaged ordinary people trying to make the best of their own situation.  All (male) actors did a fine job with Russian accents and speech.
0316166685|5.0|In hindsight, I realized that this was a popular book, especially with the book club circuit.  At the time that I read it, I knew nothing about it except for the editorial synopsis, and am glad I hadn't heard any of the hype.  For me, at least, it changes the reading experience to know too much ahead of time (including \\"public opinion\\").  Given the subject matter & the description, I wouldn't have picked this to read, but a group of fellow readers wanted to read it, and I just went along for the ride.    The Lovely Bones was one of those rare surprises - a book I wouldn't have picked, but happened to read anyway, and thoroughly enjoyed.  Sebold is a beautiful writer.  I'm not talking about the subject or the story, just about the way she writes.  At times, her descriptions are poetry.  I read it a second time just to concentrate on her style.  It's beautiful.    That said, the story was also interesting, funny and sad (achingly so).  So many interesting and believable characters.  I know I'll re-read it again eventually.    P.S.  For an additional treat, if the opportunity presents itself, check out the audio version narrated by Alyssa Bresnahan - you'll swear you are listening to Susie herself...

I and thousand (probably millions) of other women have connected so deeply with Elizabeth Gilbert's brutally honest story, that I, and many of my friends feel she has given us all a priceless gift.

B0000CDLA7|3.0|This album isn't horrible.  It's clear that DT wanted to create a more thrashy, heavier, sound on this release.  However, I thought the first track was painfully awful, and it took me some time to recover before I could start digesting the compositions later in the album.<br /><br />Ultimately, there are some maniacally genius moments here - but, for the most part it just isn't accessible enough. And I'm saying that from the point of view of a DT fan who has listened to and thoroughly enjoyed some of their other albums.  There were too many times when this album just lost me in the sludge between the more interesting structures.<br /><br />Still, DT do what DT does.  And this is exactly that.  They aren't just a progressive band on the track level, they are also a progressive band on the album level - where each album progresses and introduces new styles and nuances.  All is forgiven.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|While I thought that Fahrenheit 911 was impressive in more than one way, after further meditation I came to believe that it was too faulty in its presentation, vague and probably excessively focused on getting John Kerry elected. It too easily played into the hands of his half-wit right wing critics. The present film in contrast, is simple, moving and honest. Unless they are hopelessly indoctrinated, which maybe more than a few of them are, many Americans have had too much real life experience to swallow the corporate funded think tank propaganda about our health system repeated by talk radio hosts, Dr. Sanjay Gupta and other compromised people.<br /><br />As Moore observes, while people who don't have health insurance in this country are in bad shape--he quotes the National Institute of Health figure of 18000 deaths a year from lack of access to health insurance--more subtly pernicious is what happens to people who are technically supposed to be fully covered.  He presents horror stories from  real Americans. There is the middle aged Colorado couple--a newspaper editor and a unionized machinist--who after going through a couple of heart attacks and a cancer, were bankrupted under the weight of their co-pays and deductibles. This couple was forced to move into the storage room at their daughter's house while a son visited them and seemed to blame them for their plight instead of their HMO. There is the toddler girl who was initially rejected for a cochlear transplant in both her ears until her father threatened to have Moore give the case publicity. There is the Missouri woman whose husband was rejected for a bone marrow transplant on the ground that it would be an \\"experimental\\" treatment and who eventually died from kidney cancer. There is the woman who died from a brain tumor after being repeatedly told that nothing was threatening her. There was the little black girl who died from a fever at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in South Central LA because the hospital kept stalling about approving her mother's fully covered insurance. He interviews two HMO case reviewers and a call center employee describing how they were rewarded for authorizing treatment for as few people as possible so that costs would be kept low and the profits of their company's executives maximized. Moore shows the tape of a Nixon-Halderman conversation from 1971 where Nixon says that it's just fine by him in responding to Halderman's comments that government promotion of HMO system would lead to the promotion of the paramount principle of little treatment as possible for maximization of profit.<br /><br />Moore presents sound bites from critics of socialized medicine beginning with AMA propaganda from the early 60's....Moore interviews citizens, including a few doctors, of Canada, Britain and France, and Americans living in Britain and France and comes away with a picture that whatever the flaws in those health systems, they are  superior to our own. He quotes an AMA study which stated that even the poorest Britons had better health than many Americans. One can repeat slogans about the horrors of bureaucracy and stories about long waits but one can't escape from the fact that we have the costliest, most bureaucratic system in the Western World and get the worst results.<br /><br />Then he goes to Cuba with the former newspaper editor mentioned above and several 911 rescue workers still suffering from serious physical and psychological troubles as a result of their experiences in the WTC rubble. I spent 20 days in Cuba in January 2004, shortly before Bush slapped a complete ban on legal travel to the country. Life is pretty difficult for a good portion of the population. And yes as the gifted statesman Fred Thompson has argued against this movie, people are tortured in Cuban prisons which of course is irrelevant to the relative merits of their health care system. When one considers that the  U.S and Cuba are roughly equal in terms of infant mortality and when one considers that Cuba is a third world country with scant resources compared to the United States, the richest country the world has ever seen, Cuba's achievements are all the more remarkable. Since the collapse of their markets in the Soviet bloc and with access to the U.S. market denied, they have had to pay very high costs for equipment like heart monitors from other countries (like Japan). Of course, U.S. statesmen don't place crushing embargos on countries that don't flout corporate globalization like Uzbekistan and Equatorial Guinea that offer little genuine health care and torture their prisoners much worse than Fidel's goons. Not to mention the horrors that go on in our own prisons.<br /><br />He does a poor job discussing recent health care reform proposals. For instance in his discussion of the Clinton health care plan of 93-94, he mentions that then First Lady Clinton declared herself hot for \\"universal\\" coverage. Then he states there was a massive business campaign against the plan and when she became a senator in 2001 she retreated from her radicalism and began to receive generous donations from health care PACs..  However, the Clinton proposals of the 90's were not \\"universal.\\" The proposal was written with heavy input from the five largest HMO's. It was the smaller HMO's who raised the idiotic alarms about \\"socialized medicine\\" and who felt t that the Clintons' idea for a government run board to devise a series of a health plans for consumers to use in the private sector would inevitably be dominated by their bigger competitors. Perhaps it would have provided more stable prices than Bush's Medicare plan or somewhat contained the excesses of the system we face today.  However the Clinton plan seems to have produced many worse offshoots such as in Mitt Romney's Massachusetts with its grossly inadequate subsidies to deal with rising private sector health costs.<br /><br />This film struck a chord with me as I deal with my mother's cancer.Cuba is a third world country with scant resources compared to the United States, the richest country the world has ever seen, Cuba's achievements are all the more remarkable.

0978607651|5.0|As soon as I saw Harper's wonderful bird illustrations in Audubon magazine, I had to see more of his work. I was pretty taken aback by the price at first, but after previewing the entire book on the AMMO website (see Discussions below), I was more confident with my decision. It looked beautiful in the Flash slideshow and I hoped that it would look just as clear in the printed book. I had some concerns about the paper affecting print quality as the other reviewer mentioned, but I'd read other blogs & reviews from other sites and I'd heard more than enough good things about this volume.<br /><br />It arrived in a lovely black & white patterned box to protect it during shipping, which is also useful for storage. As far as printing quality goes, it looks very similar to my vintage encyclopedia set from the 1960s - I have a feeling that they chose the matte paper for this reason. Yes, the colors are not as vibrant as the online preview (or the glossy pages of Audubon magazine), and yes, many of the images look like enlarged scans from previously-printed sources. You can see the blown-up halftone and a bit of a blurry edge on many illustrations. The photos of his wonderful mosaics need some color adjustment and look better online.<br /><br />However, the whites are crisp and the blacks are pure black, and I'm not disappointed (I'm a picky OCD graphic designer too). My favorite aspects of this book are the creative spread layouts, the sketches & \\"in-progress\\" material, and the sheer volume & range of works contained in this book. It's an expensive book, but it's a deal when you consider the individual price of prints. In many cases, the prints will be about the same size as these pages anyways!
0765318741|4.0|What a fantastically bleak tale.  I decided to read this after seeing previews for the movie.  Of course, the book is always better than the movie, so why not read what all the hype is about before seeing Will Smith present it.  Just from seeing previews, I could discern a number of differences between the movie and the book, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this great story.<br /><br />Robert Neville is a survivor, the last human among a world of plague-ridden vampires.  You probably know the story already, so let me emphasize the mood.  Matheson creates circumstances that are so believable and an atmosphere that is so gripping that I felt like I was surviving right along with Neville.  As I watched Neville evolve in his situation, I wanted to cheer him on and encourage him not to give up.  This book was so masterfully written, it's no wonder it inspired the likes of Stephen King.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|This is more than a movie musical...it was a bonding experience for me and my 14 year old daughter. For a brief time while watching Across the Universe, and for the subsequent time spent discussing its musical and visual qualities together after the credits ran, I felt I was back in the sixties again with the same emergent consciousness portrayed by the film's principal characters. We were so excited by this experience that we had to return to see the movie again with even more gusto resulting from added perception of subtle goings-on that we had missed in our initial viewing. An overall enjoyable sight and sound experience. This will be a real \\"keeper\\" when it gets to DVD release next month.    P.S. I'm surprised there was no Penny Lane to be found...or would that have been too obvious?

It has a story, little unusual in the sense that a mouse is a cook but the messages given through the sentences of the mouse are real life messages everyone could benefit from. I loved the feeling when the mouse, Remi was holding onto the cook book firmly while he was floating on the water: he had the book as his boat but more than that he did not want to lose the book, the source of inspiration for his cooking journey. I think you will feel delighted with this movie while wathcing this little mouse following his heart to his life's mission and the integration of his life to the lives of other mice and people around him with plentiful meaningful messages.

0385333846|3.0|I was left disappointed by Slaughterhouse-five. I see the creativity no doubt, and I also see the ease at which it reads. What I don't see is a top 20 of all time science fiction books. This book as it is is borderline science fiction at all. What Kurt calls time travel is only Billy Pilgrim remembering the past. Obviously his abduction by aliens was a result of his skull being fractured.<br /><br />I am just amazed that over 400 reviews of this book give it a 5 star rating.  It just isn't that good plain and simple. Kurt has the ability to tell a story but this one just doesn't work. Too much reminiscent jumping and not enough science fiction. The satire falls empty and has no teeth. I would have given this book a 2 star rating if not for the unique writing style utilized by Kurt.<br /><br />Definitely a passerby and not worth the reading. Save your eyes for something else.

The only way I will ever use this DVD again would be with the picture off.

I only recently saw the movie, but the music stands out more than anything for me. It's slow, but comforting, and not depressing by any means.

This is not some treacly self-help sob-story soapbox with a happy ending -- well it is, but Gilbert's a deft enough writer to spin a good yarn absolutely entertainingly.  Looking for God?  I have to admit it put me off for a few beats in the beginning.  But Gilbert won me over with her humor and sincerity. Kind of refreshing to hear someone talk unabashedly about even wanting to think about God.           [[ASIN:0312378955 Winged Creatures: A Novel]]
B000YIGNKE|2.0|Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's best books and this version really does not do the story justice. I don't think it was well cast (Wentworth was fine, but Anne was relatively annoying) and what is up with Anne running all over town, kissing all over Wentworth? I'm pretty sure all of that was not acceptable in the period, especially since Anne had given up her engagement to Wentworth because of her status, I can't see her flying in the face of tradition this much.    If you really want to watch a version of Persuasion, watch the 1995 version. It was much more true to the story, better cast and better filmed.

B000I2J79K|3.0|Both of these bands were among my favorite all-time groups.    Saw this same concert live in Pittsburgh. Much the same then as on the DVD. EWF was fabulous - band and vocals were tight and Verdine was amazing for a guy that was a member of the original group.     Chicago was very sloppy with the vocals and way over the top. Played their best tunes but didn't know how to match up with EWF either visually or musically. Couple of the older guys just looked tired. The sound guys for EWF were on top of their game. Didn't sound like Chicago was even in the same venue. Chicago horns were very distorted. Too bad. Guitarists in both bands were awesome and so was the drumming. Chicago had some good moments but not as consistent as EW&F.    DVD is definitely worth the money for the EWF portions though. Now when is BS&T and Tower of Power going to go on the road together?   ;-)
031286504X|1.0|I am an avid reader; I read perhaps 3-4 novels a month. I've read dozens of horror/suspense novels from great authors like King, Koontz and Ludlum. I've also managed to find some less than impressive offerings. This however, is among the worst. I'm sure it has great literary prowess, but I found it difficult to follow and ultimately unsasifying. Many times it seems to lose track of the basic story motivation, and becomes soley about the characters battle with alcohol and self-loathing. It is a virtual certainty that movies spawned from a novel don't live up to its forebearer, but in this case, I think the movie has improved upon it exponentially.
1594489505|5.0|I must say that Khaled Hosseini is one of the absolute, most talented authors in all of time! His stories seem too real to be fiction and the detail is just amazing. His imagination for fiction blows me away! This story is about the lives of 2 women in Afghanastan and how they are brought together, where Kite Runner (a DEFINATE MUST READ) is about 2 boys and their friendship growing up in Afghanastan. Your emotions will take you for a ride in this book as you experience the culture and life of these two women.

I found it not only informative, but much more entertaining than the other fashion books out there.  I highly recommend this one -  I tore through it in less than a day.  As a Mom, I also found it refreshing to find that there is one Pop Princess out there has real STYLE - and plans to keep her \\"knickers\\" on!  Thanks Vicoria!
B000WCDI5K|4.0|Review 1 of 5     moodyg writes:    4of 5 Stars     Sawdust is pretty good for a b-sides compilation. It's interesting that a collection of b-sides, rare releases, and covers could really be so entertaining. But the record stands pretty solid. I especially like Tranquilize, the duet with Lou Reed. It shows the depth and the range of the Killers and it also gives an idea about a possible new artistic direction. While Tranquilize is dark, the song Sweet Talk is bright and full of hope and reminds of of how masterful the Killers can be when it comes to lyrics and finding the perfect balance between a good hook and fine vocals. I would say the band is better now than they were were 3 years ago, and better than they were when they initially released Sam's Town. In short, The Killers just keep getting better over time....and if you see them live, you would understand fully what I mean.     There is really only one song that I didn't quite care for and maybe because the original is always just so hard to beat-- for me here, the unnecessary, and drab, slow version of Mr. Brightside, wasn't the best choice to end the record with. But then again, the hidden track, The Captain's theme, makes up for what the re-mix of Mr. Brightside didn't give me.     The Killers also prove that they are truly talented as they produce fine covers of 'Ruby Don't Take Your Love To Town' and 'Shadowplay'. Many have mixed feelings on the cover of Shadowplay, but ultimately, I think the Killers do a fine job with keeping a dark element alive to the song, while providing what is clearly their own trademark style and song. They also offer up a lovely version of Dire Staits' 'Romeo & Juliet', it's like a chord for chord re-do, but lovely none-the-less.     The Killers are often criticized for taking risks with their sound, but in the long run, the bands that take the risks are the ones that keep most people interested, and who have longevity in the industry.     Hot Fuss, was too dancy for some, thenwith Sam's Town, it was too rock and not dancy enough, now with Sawdust, there are those who say the band is out to make a dollar by releasing the compliation, but there is very little filler here, and some of the songs sound so good that I wonder how they got cut in the first place. Over-all though, The Killers have done something that isn't unique or novel in releasing a b-sides so early in their careers. They aren't the first band to do, and I'm certain they won't be the last. The question is, will the others who do so be able to display such a range in their musicianship as well as their creativity?     I think The Killers for all their critics and fair-weather fans, have pretty much weathered the storm. I look forward to their next full length lp-- no matter the direction that their artistic and creative desires might take them.     In short, Sawdust-- a MUST have for die-hard Killers' fans and the new Killers' fans alike. It's a nice treat while we wait for the band's next big outing.

Why couldn't we see more about the Armada itself & what happened to Spain & Britain as a result . This was pivotal to both nations & indeed the future establishment of the US as an english speaking colony not a spanish or french or dutch colony . England bacame THE world seapower after this & spain fell in to long term decline - Spain's empire included most of Europe plus most of South & Central America .

It simply velcros to the bars and when I had to gate check the stroller I took it off and put it in the stroller as I folded it up. I am very glad that I had them along!

1416550518|3.0|The story is told from a first person narration by a woman in her 90s, at the near end of her life. The tool used to tell the story is flipping back and forth from the past to the present. The style of the novel is reminiscent of Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier and Titanic (the movie) to name a few.<br /><br />The amount of research done for this book is phenomenal. The period and socio-economic times of the setting have been laid out meticulously. This attention to detail allows the reader to understand the true issues of the main character's dilemma; and helps the reader understand the importance of the various secrets in the plot line. The House at Riverton was a quick read, entertaining, but not very thought provoking.<br /><br />Too many clues were left for the reader to figure out the \\"secrets\\" - and there were many. This book was just not very challenging, though it was entertaining. I found myself extremely interested in the first part through half of the second part. Unfortunately, after that, I was just reading to finish it, not because I was enthralled in the story. I was curious to know how the author would end the novel, but that really had nothing to do with knowing how the story ended.
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan and I love all of her books. \\"Persuasion\\" is a subtle, gentle sort of love story that, when filmed, relies heavily on the actors to portray emotions that must be kept hidden or simmering -- not an easy feat for any actor! Unfortunately, the casting of the actors here is so far off it makes me wonder what the casting director was thinking.<br /><br />To start, poor Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot is a disaster. Yes, Anne is supposed to have grown plain at her advanced age of 27 (!) but not downright homely. Perhaps it is cruel to use the word \\"homely,\\" but I can't think of any other way to describe Ms. Hawkins in this movie. She is not only homely but so overwhelmingly cowed I wanted to shake her! This is not Anne as Austen wrote the character. And Rupert Penry-Jones, while a good actor and a hottie to boot, was not a good choice for Captain Wentworth. He is far too \\"pretty,\\" and not rough enough to convince us he won his fortune as a naval captain in the Napoleonic wars. The combination of the painfully unattractive Anne with the super-cute Frederick just does not work -- there is no chemistry between the actors, (oh dear God that awful kiss!) and not for one minute did I believe he was in love with her -- now or ever.<br /><br />Other questionable casting choices include the way-too-old looking Julia Davis who played Elizabeth and the weirdly stooped, mugging actress who played Anne's other sister, Mary. Yikes!<br /><br />Casting that worked well, however, was Anthony Head (Giles from \\"Buffy,\\" believe it or not) as the snobbish Sir Walter, and the marvelous Tobias Menzies (\\"Brutus\\" from HBO's \\"Rome\\") as cousin William Elliot. Tobias Menzies and the lovely production quality of the film earn it two stars, but otherwise if you are a fan of \\"Persuasion,\\" you must check out the version starring Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. Truly outstanding acting and a DVD you will watch again and again -- well worth purchasing. As for the Hawkins-Jones version, watch it on Masterpiece Theatre or rent it, then compare it to the Hinds/Root version, and see what you think before you buy.piece Theatre or rent it, then compare it to the Hinds/Root version, and see what you think before you buy.
0446677450|5.0|Despite having a high school education and a college degree, I was never<br />educated on the subject of money.  As I leapt into adulthood I found myself in debt 10 years later with no clue how to get out and no clue how to produce wealth in my life.  A friend suggested that I read Robert T. Kiyosaki's \\"Rich Dad Poor Dad\\".  This book has opened my eyes to the logistics of how money works and how I can make it work for me.  This book has helped me to take control of my finances and now, at age 39, I am out of debt. I have a deeper understanding of money, like never before, on what I need to do to make my money work for me.  Now I am clear on the difference between assets and liabilities.<br /><br />It's so exciting that Robert T. Kiyosaki is sharing his wisdom of financial education.  It is one subject that should be added to the educational curriculum. Another subject that was not offered in any of my educational experiences was how to achieve and experience well being.  As Robert T. Kiyosaki is sharing the gems of financial freedom with the world, authors Ariel and Shya Kane are sharing the priceless knowledge of instantaneous transformation in their books, [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], [[ASIN:1888043148 How To Create a Magical Relationship]], and [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]].  In their writings, I have discovered the ease that is possible in living.  I didn't know much about finances and I found Robert T. Kiyosaki.  I searched for enlightenment and I found the Kanes. It's a gift to find authors that can write about what works!
B000X5KSWM|2.0|Okay, so maybe average is a little harsh. Her vocals are amazing as always, and the song \\"I walk Alone\\" is pretty good. After that though...the music is pretty boring. Ballad after ballad...and the only rocking out parts feel forced - as if she's only doing that to entice Nightwish fans into buying into her.     All in all, I'm not going to buy this, or other CD's from her until the music songwriting quality steps up a few notches. It's a decent effort, but feels flat...and like she's just trying to appease old Nightwish fans with something that isn't what they want.

Because it made me cry several times throughout the movie. I wasn't sure I would have liked Hillary Swank beside Gerard Butler, but it worked. And I was glad Gerard got to sing again!! He's got a great voice and I've listened to him over and over again from \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". I loved the scenery in it also. It was breath taking! When is Gerard going to be nominated for an award for his great acting!! And you gotta love the accent.

B000WMFZMY|5.0|Like Mann's other well-known feature, \\"Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" El Cid has a lot going for it: breathtaking Spanish scenery and fabulously authentic set pieces, two very competent and attractive leads with Heston and Loren, and an interesting protagonist whose story is steeped more in myth than reality.<br /><br />Although this DVD has not yet been released, this film, like \\"Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" is worthy of a \\"special edition\\" replete with interviews, extras, a behind-the-scenes documentary, deleted scenes, and the like--should they even exist. The film was released almost 45 years ago.<br /><br />While not as opulent as \\"Fall\\" that would be released three years later, the love story between Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar (El Cid) and Chimene, his wife is a more interesting one--as interesting as the story of the Cid himself.<br /><br />These are characters one feels emotionally attached to unlike those of Livius and Drusilla in Mann's 'Fall,\\" which resembles yet an additional prop to the sets to Mann's $16 million dollar epic, but Mann got off relatively cheap with \\"El Cid,\\" utilizing many of the existing medieval castles that dot the coastlines of sunny Spain.<br /><br />Chimene loves Rodrigo who is to be her husband, than hates him for killing her father who insults Rodrigo's father and his family name. She marries Rodrigo out of spite at the request of King Ferdinand, and Chimene colludes to kill Rodrigo with a fellow conspirator who also loves her. Later, she ultimately learns to love this selfless knight who shows mercy to his enemies, earns their respect, and defends a brat of a king who is nothing more than a spoiled tyrant--wonderfully played by popular 60's British mod, John Fraser who would later win a coveted supporting role in Roman Polanski's \\"Repulsion.\\"<br /><br />The movie gets 5 stars despite the fact that battle scenes seem rather brief and could have been better orchestrated on a slightly more lavish scale. Mann's \\"Fall\\" clearly has an edge here; what we see in \\"El Cid\\" for the majority of the film are really skirmishes of no more than 15 to 20 men at a time. The Miklos Rosza score, obviously influenced by the achingly beautiful coda in Tchaikovsky's Symphony 4, and like all of his splendid soundtracks, will compel an exhaustive search for the compact disc at your local retailer. Clearly, this is music to be savored like a fine Castillian wine.<br /><br />This was a role Heston was born to play: physical, larger than life, and majestic in scope. In a death-scene that is perhaps one of the longest, most touchingly portrayed, and perhaps Heston's finest in an epic like this, will move you as will the story of this heroic 11th Century knight who attempted to unite his divided Spain.jority of the film are really skirmishes of no more than 15 to 20 men at a time.

I had this book with me on a trip and didn't manage to open it before return flight, which happened to be delayed and eventually rescheduled for the next day.

B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Elvis Costello-This Years Model *****<br /><br />The toss up between the bug two. By the big two I mean Elvis Costello's two biggest albums, his debut My Aim Is True, and his sophomore effort, This Years Model and which is better. Many will tell you his less famous albums which he realesed after This Years Model were his best. But really I have never understood why with Costello everyone insists on comparing all his albums and constantly ranking them, honestly the man has never mad a bad record. His band, The Atractions is one of the best punk/new wave/post punk bands of all time. His song writing is simply put, prolific. As a guitar player he is fantastic as well, and as for This Years Model, the album is incredible.<br /><br />It was his second album realesed in 1978 this brit managed to realease two of the greatest albums in rock history with his first two at bats. Songs like 'Lipstick Vougue' evoke images of The Replacements, The Romantics, Clash, and John Lennon. Sexy, comlicated, angry, and somehow meloncolly all at the same time. 'Pump It Up' is the deffinition of new wave. 'Hand In Hand' is touching while the reggea influenced '(I Dont Want To Go To) Chelsea' is both loose and fun, and at times disturbing. Known for his brilliant imagry in his lyrics, songs like 'This Years Girl' 'Little Triggers' and 'Night Rally' dont dissapoint. The albums big hit single, well maybe not big but still hit single 'Radio, Radio' is a classic and propelled this album and The Atractions to major success and right afterward Costello threw it all away to be true to himself, which I will always take my hat of to him for that as long as I live.<br /><br />The bonus disk which comes with this particular issue is a must have for those who are die hard Costello fans, but not one I would recomend to the average fan.<br /><br />So is This Years Model better then My Aim Is True or any of Costellos other albums? Does it really matter? well no it doesn't but to answer the question, I must give my opinion and say that this is his most focused album and also his most asseble and varied, but in my opinion this is only his second best album. My Aim Is True is far superior even though This Years Model is a fantastic album!this is his most focused album and also his most asseble and varied, but in my opinion this is only his second best album.

0143038419|5.0|This is a wonderful book that I recommend to have fun (it is a light  read!) and also one to find wisdom. After Liz Gilbert's divorce she takes  you on an extraordinary journey through Italy, India and Indonesia, and to  the depths of her soul.  This is one brilliant and inspiring story, not only could I not put the book down, but I also felt empowered as a woman because of her honest and sincere accounts.<br />Through her quest for enlightenment and peace, Liz reminded me of another book [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]] by Ariel & Shya Kane. The Kanes'inspirational and casual stories have touched my heart deeply and also made me smile in awe. Thru their pages I remember how rich and sweet life can be. Bravo! to both Gilbert and the Kanes for bringing us enlightenment for this day and age.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|Another engaging, introspective TV movie featuring Robert B. Parker's \\"Jesse Stone\\" police chief character.  Though the second of the Jesse Stone films, \\"Jesse Stone: Night Passage\\" chronologically takes place before \\"Stone Cold\\", the first film produced.  That's because this is an \\"origin\\" story, showing how Chief Stone landed his job in Paradise, Massachusetts.<br /><br />The same thoughtful, measured, \\"artistic\\" feel of \\"Stone Cold\\" permeates this film, as well.  Some people find this approach slow and a bit dull, but I like it.  My only quibble this time out is a conclusion that wraps every plot point up a bit too quickly and neatly during the course of one scene: some explanation, a shooting, a little more explanation, a little more shooting, all questions answered.  The scene also shows us Jesse stupidly putting himself completely at risk as he attempts to spring his trap.<br /><br />But, as said, that's just a quibble, and the movie is generally very good.  Just the fact that these Jesse Stone movies are clearly aimed at literate adults who enjoy skillful, nuanced dialogue and artful cinematography is enough for me to give these productions a strong recommendation.

Some of the first version stuff is, now compared, a lot better, but was butchered out by Jimmy and his whiz protools engineer.<br /><br />Keep well your old TRRS cd.  Our beloved Page edited or changed several songs that are way better than the ones he put instead. His Acapulco Golden tea must have been too strong.,,<br /><br />The best and non edited versions of the older cd are -Celebration Day, The Song Remains The Same. Moby Dick, Whole Lotta Love and No Quarter wich features  THE rock guitar solo,  an incredibly tasteful and well constructed killer.  I  would place IT  in between Page's best 3 alltime solos... LISTEN TO it and YOU WILL FALL ON YOUR KNEES, CRYING IN JOY AGAIN.  The new version is inhumanly edited out,,,  THE CRESCENDO AND OTHER VITAL SEGMENTS are gone...<br />The other mentioned tracks have incredible bits that were inexplicably substracted,<br />.<br />Of course the remastered sound is way better, so just enjoy both cd`s like different concerts, THE  Extra tracks are very good.  The packaging is beautiful<br />but the design is nasty for the cd;s which get damaged in  a very tight space.

EELS can bring you down and pull you right up to the top with their music.<br /><br />This album is a collection of most of my favorite EELS songs, and if you are a first time listener, then this collection is the best way to introduce you to the band.<br /><br />It's not about winning grammys or making appearences at award shows , its about playing straight from the heart. That's what E does. I recently lost my dad and his single 'It's a mother #$%#$%' makes me cry a tear everytime i play it on my cd system.<br /><br />Pick it up people, EELS are a fine example of great musicians that hit the right cord in each of their songs.<br /><br />Enjoy..oh btw..pick up the 'Useless Trinklet's' CD too, it's got plenty of great b-sides and unreleased tracks.
B000P12LWY|4.0|*The Tudors* presents a costume drama full of intrigue, violence and sex. (Lots of sex. These naughty Renaissance fornicators never appeared in any of my textbooks.)  Henry VIII, it turns out, wasn't always a bloated, misogynistic pig. In fact, in his 20s and 30s, he was handsome, athletic, ambitious, a bit of a clothes horse. Costume designer Joan Bergin calls him \\"the Mick Jagger of his day,\\" and Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays him as a stud in velvet breeches. But Rhys Meyers' small stature and intense lisping undercuts the macho posturing of young Henry Tudor (who evidently made political decisions based on the outcomes of jousting and arm-wrestling contests).  You'll probably get caught up in all The Tudors' scheming and backstabbing, even if you don't know your Duke of Norfolk from your Marquess of Dorset -- but you'll appreciate it even more if you do some studying beforehand. The Season One teleplays were written by Michael Hirst, who scripted both of Cate Blanchett's *Elizabeth* movies, so he knows his Tudor history. But he may know too much: You could play a drinking game based on every time two Renaissance-y chaps stroll down a corridor with one asking, \\"Your Grace, have you heard whether Lord Salisbury's emissary to the Spanish court has returned with news of the treaty?\\" Uncharacterized characters pop up in unexplained plot tangents all the time.    Still, fans of Renaissance history will enjoy what's dramatized: So that's what the Field of the Cloth of Gold (a kind of English-French bucolic peace party in 1520) may have looked like. Sequences with emotional intensity outweigh the historical inaccuracies. An accidental and humiliating brush with death (and his bastard son's exposure to \\"the sweating sickness\\") help explain Henry's obsession with begetting an heir. Sam Neill (Jurassic Park) is great at conveying the wheedling and false subservience of Cardinal Wolsey, Henry's chief advisor. And English majors will appreciate the end of Episode Six, which juxtaposes a Sir Thomas Wyatt poem about coquettish Anne Boleyn (\\"They flee from me\\") with political scheming by Wolsey's enemies, nicely enmeshing the sexual and the political. Even in the 16th century, sex and intrigue made for good ratings.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|This production was execrable in nearly every way.  The acting and casting were bad for most of the characters, the direction was bad, but most particularly, the writing was bad.  This is not about the adaptation being unlike the book; every screen adaptation of a novel is a screenwriter's effort to make a dramatic work from a written work.  Simon Burke did a wonderful job of adapting Tom Jones for the BBC in 1997; something has gone very wrong this time.  Either he did not like or understand the novel, in which case he should have turned down the project, or else his hand was forced by the producers, in which case it is surprising that he allowed his name to be put to this amateurish adaptation.  It is blighted with three features characteristic of a bad screenplay, to the point that it is difficult to understand why it was produced at all: The stilted expository speeches put into the mouths of the characters, e.g.\\"Oh hello, Anne Elliot.  You were disappointed in love eight years ago and are afraid you will become an old maid, because women your age in this time period ought to be married by now, just in case the audience can't keep up with what's going on.\\" With a lack of concision also characteristic of a bad screenplay, how many scenes were wasted on the lead character sitting at her desk, in a production that condensed a complex novel into 90 minutes of screen time? Finally, the narrative voice-over really completed the amateurish feel.  That silly scene at the end where she's running all over Bath in her slippers is just a recap of what's wrong with the whole show.  Ew! Badly done!

Naomi Klein would appear to me very much a capitalist herself, if she too believes that government should not be in the business of dishing out favors to well-connected cronies.    David Thayer
B000Y7U98C|2.0|Oh, where is Arthur C. Clarke or anybody who ever passed a science course when you need them?  The science in this alleged science fiction film gets the grade of \\"F.\\"  Okay, we worry about where the food and the oxygen come from, but where does their gravity come from in this 2001-look-alike spaceship?  Where did they get the chicken they were eating in the only meal scene?  No doubt there were several frozen at absolute zero and hanging on hooks outside the hatch?  Yes, it's cold in space, because space is a vacuum. Your body would explode in an absolute vacuum long before you felt a chill. All the remaining fissile material on earth is hooked on front of the Icarus II? A big bomb to re-ignite the sun?  Hooey!  After watching a film like this and then seeing all of these glowing reviews, I understand why many people believe that bio-fuel is the twin answer to the energy and the environmental crises. Good science fiction inspires good scientists to create good science. \\"Sunshine\\" is the stuff that inspires MST3K parody. Are there no screenwriters or directors who ever read a science book? Actual science can have dramatic meaning, too!
1857988132|1.0|A perfect Sci-Fi classic! Funny thing is the book was awful! It's the first time I thought the screenplay was better! The movie story and dialog are much better.
B000XT8H26|5.0|i've always dug me some Donald Byrd and his approach to Groove and arrangements will keep your head bopping non stop and this album was one of those albums where his trademark playing and his fusion of Jazz/funk is something that will keep your ear steady. i bought this album on disc about a decade and change ago and i have what i call the DOnald Byrd section of my music collection and stay on the Grooves. real solid and full of Snap and Funk on here.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I have everything done by them and I'm glad to see they are back. It's what you would expect. Not as pop as The Bends, no hits like on OK Computer and not as experimental as Kid A. Really good though. A solid effort and worth buying.
B000UCEJEQ|4.0|When I got this album last fall and listened to it for the first time, I thought it was a very nice album and then I got to the 'Sing' track and was blown away. The choir of 23 on the track reads like a who's who of female singers including Bonnie Raitt, Madonna and Faith Hill among others. The song is a tribute to Annie's Aids/Hiv fight. This song alone is worth the cost of the cd but there's lots more here both ballads and up tempo tunes. Annie plays piano and keyboards on some of these selections. She also wrote all the songs. Lyrics are included. Who but Annie could write a song called 'Colored Bedspread' or 'Fingernail Moon' and make it work. Good going Annie and we look forward to more of the same.
B000K15VSA|5.0|OK they cleaned it up a lot. It looks great. If you have the Directors Cut don't expect it to be all that different but if you are a hardcore fan like me you will want everything in this package. The documentary on how they made the film is almost 4 hours long and just as entertaining as the movie. Worth every penny to me. A perfect Sci-Fi classic! Funny thing is the book was awful! It's the first time I thought the screen play was better!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'd heard so much about this show and the serial killer who murders serial killers that I decided to give it a try. \\"Dexter\\" had me hooked in the first very intense ten minutes. I watched both seasons in three days. Anyone who hasn't seen \\"Dexter\\" needs to. It's a show that you just can't look away from, pulling you in and never letting go.
B0000630BT|5.0|I've reviewed other JP albums here and have stated that I became a fan as a kid in 1981 after discovering the band through 1980's British Steel. However, 22 years after the fact, I still have a dusty cassette of \\"Turbo\\" that I bought in 1986, played once and.....collected dust. Thought that album stunk and honestly lost faith in them. I didn't bother to buy Ram it Down or even listen to it because in 1988...the only thing associated with that album was the Chuck Berry cover in......Anthony Michael Hall's Johnny Be Good. I was like, this awesome metal band is featuring a song in a frickin' Hall flick? Needless to say I did not buy Ram it Down. Buy the time Painkiller came out in 90', I had long since lost touch with their happenings. However some of my buddy's in the late 90's got on me for badmouthing Priest as \\"sucked after Defenders.\\" They encouraged me to check out Painkiller. Needless, to say, I was very impressed and it was definitely their heaviest recording. I saw what it was. 40 year old musicians that were long since thrown under the bus as hasbeens who wanted one last kick at the can and definitely delivered with a Super Bowl winning kick. The title track and \\"Metal Meltdown\\" never get old. The drums and guitar are killer. Travis definitely brought a jolt at drums and gave them their finest recording since \\"Stained Class.\\" Their early 80's albums are awesome, but we can all admit Steel was the album that exposed me to them by being radio accessible in 1981. They went commercial somewhat from 80' to 88', however Painkiller brought them back to their late 70's roots with updated thrash and drum skills the band never previously displayed thanks to Travis.
B000Y7U98W|3.0|As a professor of physics and astronomy I found \\"Sunshine's\\" premise of \\"kick starting\\" the fading Sun with a nuclear bomb the size of a football field to be humorous at best.  The Sun will not run out of nuclear \\"fuel\\" for about 5 billion more years. When it does, even a nuclear device the size of the one shown in the movie would have no significant affect.  And BTW, why risk the lives of a crew when the device could more easily be delivered by a robotic spacecraft?  The scene of the crew member basking in the glow of the radiation inside the nuclear pile was ... well ... \\"interesting.\\"<br /><br />OK, the juvenile science fiction aside, \\"Sunshine\\" did have it's moments.  The special effects were pretty decent for a \\"B\\" movie and the acting was passable.  Even though \\"Sunshine\\" doesn't compare to classic scifi flicks such as \\"2001,\\"  \\"Deep Impact\\", or \\"Contact\\", this makes a reasonable desperation rental if Blockbuster is out of the \\"good stuff.\\"  As for purchasing it and adding it to my Blu-ray movie collection ... not hardly!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|I agree with so many of the other reviewers, the Amanda Root version was sublime. I have seen it several times, including at the movie theatre, and that version was so rich and deep and satisfyingly romantic. In this current version though, I did like Sally Hawkins a lot. I found her to be a wonderful actress with beautiful eyes and expressions. It was not her fault her part was written so poorly and wimpily. Several reviewers have mentioned  the kiss between the leads, I have to agree! It was not good, and shot at a bad camera angle.<br />Also the sound was horrid, people were talking in those big drafty English parlors and rooms, and the echos were so strong it sounded as though they just had put little microphones on the floor.<br />I did enjoy the show, but I have to say I kept constantly comparing to the 1995 SO much better version.<br />And I hate that Masterpiece Theatre changed it's name to just Masterpiece. How stupid is that!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|This show is funny, witty, and amazing.  It's very similar in caliber to Friends!
B000MRAAJW|5.0|A High Definition spectacular. Makes you realize how beautiful Earth and its inhabitants are. Enjoy this HD-DVD with any group of people. A documentary of biblical proportions to be placed in a capsule and sent out into space for other intelligent life to enjoy.
037582913X|5.0|A classic and still completely relevant for today's Grover fan. It's one of the few books that I don't mind reading over and over and over again.
B00063F8B2|5.0|I love this movie. I am pleased with all my purchases.  Thank you and keep up the good work.
0440238609|1.0|I read all three books, and I enjoyed the first one. By the middle of book two, I kept going because I had already invested so much time and surely, I thought, the books would get better. I thought the third book was entirely tedious, and the ending was anti-climactic and disappointing.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Read all reviews, placed the order for HD version. Must be a master piece, i have a HD projector with 14'x9' screen. Very much looking forward to experience the work.     I hope a similar work will be done to share aspects of current human scapes, conditions, economical, social, political, religoius, wars to give a good understanding.
0525950079|2.0|But that's what the wife and I both call it. Or BWE    I shall be brief, not discuss major plot issues, nor bemoan the gratuitous sex. Like most other reviewers, my wife and I loved Pillars, and I remember calling her excitedly when I saw the initial press release for BWE's release date. We pre-ordered it for God's sake, we were so thrilled.    This book is no Pillars. Where that book was alive in your hand, this was a weight. Where Pillars was vibrant and sparkled, BWE was dull and colorless. My wife and I agreed that it was like someone else had written a book about Kingsbridge, a la GWTW/Scarlett (dreadful!) By the end - which proved to me without doubt there truly IS a God - I couldn't have cared less for any of the main players, and found only minor characters, among them the young lesbian nun, the old Prioress, and the fellow Caris used to dye the wool and his wife, the only really decent human beings in the lot.    It was mentioned in many \\"professional\\" reviews that fans of Pillars would love this book. Well, they're either idiots or didn't read both books. I am a fan of Pillars and will happily read it again and again over time, but I'll never open BWE again.
B000I0RR7Q|5.0|I'd never seen this movie until I met my husband & he was shocked to hear that I'd never seen it! Can you believe that!??? He insisted I watch it...of course I did and fell in love with it. What passion & what a heartbreaker! It is absolutely one of my favorite movies of all time and my husband got it for me as a gift so I could watch it over & over again...and I have! Bogey is so wonderful in this one...so handsome! We now have the movie poster in our bedroom...right next to a sign that says..And They Lived Happily Ever After...! Hopeless romantic!
0765357151|5.0|Contrary to common belief, I Am Legend is not a vampire novel. What this book is in reality is a series a short horror stories written by Richard Matheson that range from the 160 page long story I Am Legend from which the book gets its name to a three page story called The Near Departed. Although I must admit that I Am Legend, the first and longest of the stories, is far and away the best, only talking about that one part does a disservice to the other ten incredible stories that are collected here. I will do a short review on each story in this book.<br /><br />I Am Legend, 5/5, 160 pages. WAY better then the movie.<br /><br />The new movie [[ASIN:B00005JPTI I Am Legend]], staring Will Smith, takes place in New York City after a \\"cure\\" for cancer mutates and turns the worlds population into flesh eating zombie/vampire mutts that can only come out at night. the movie was unimpressive, the book is outstanding.<br /><br />Everyone knows the basic plot of this story, there is only one man left alive in a world full of vampires, but despite what you might expect from a plot like that this isn't an action novel. In fact there is very little in the way of action or suspense and for the most part in moves a slower pace. What makes this book amazing is the attention to detail that author Richard Matheson put into his post apocalyptic tale. Main character Robert Neville starts out about 3 months after last seeing another human being, held up in his house at night as thousands of undead vampires call for him to come out. every day is a rigid routine, fix the houses defenses, throw the dead corpses he finds on his lawn every morning into a fire, hunt for vampires, make stakes to hunt more vampires, and then back inside before nightfall and drink himself to death. As time goes by he starts to learn how to deal with the vampires, how they live and how they die; what they are and why the act the way they do. He conducts experiments, for instance why do vampires fear crosses? Why does garlic repel them? Why do only stakes kill them? Does said stake need to go though the heart to kill? These are all fascinating questions and we get answers to them all.<br /><br />But what makes this story a true masterpiece is the ending. I will not spoil it for you who haven't read the book yet (and I encourage you to do so as soon as possible) but lets just say that it is truly amazing. If you've seen the movie, brace yourself for a shock. I am very confused as to why any writer would want to tamper with such an amazing ending, why would anyone touch this gold?<br /><br />I Am Legend has been made into three motion pictures from the original [[ASIN:B000WC3A0I The Last Man on Earth]] to [[ASIN:B000P0J0BU The Omega Man]] to this years blockbuster [[ASIN:B00005JPTI I Am Legend]]. Not only that, but horror master George Romero said it was the inspiration for his horror classic [[ASIN:B00005B1YC Night of the Living Dead]]. Truly I Am Legend is one of the most influential horror stories in history.<br /><br />Buried Talents, 4/5, 8 pages. An interesting story.<br /><br />Right off the bat I expected another short story that takes place in the I Am Legend universe, but the rest of the stories are completely independent and have nothing to do with one another. Do not go into this story expecting to read more about Vampires and garlic.<br /><br />Buried Talents is a curies piece indeed. At only 8 pages this story brings up a lot of questions but never answers them, allowing the reader to come up with their own conclusions. In this short, a carnival man runs a booth where players try to throw ping pong balls into a fishing bowl to win a prize. No one seems to be able to do it, until a mysterious man walks up and lays down his quarters. He hits every shot, making the balls go into the bowl without so much as bouncing on the bottom, and then makes the two others land right next to them in the same fashion. He keeps this up for the whole story until the very end when the carnival man tells him to leave. Doesn't sound interesting right? Sound stupid? You'd be wrong. Once again, the ending is what makes this story good. Until the very last paragraph this story isn't anything special, but the last two lines make this a story to remember.<br /><br />The Near Departed, 3 pages, 5/5. Short and to the point.<br /><br />There really isn't a lot I can say about this gem of a story, not without giving away any spoilers. Think of this story as a joke, a three page joke and nothing more. Once again, the last paragraph of this story is simply amazing.<br /><br />Prey, 15 pages, 5/5. Chuckey's inspiration?<br /><br />Its inconceivable that one book, or rather a collection of short stories, could not only be the inspiration for Night of the Living Dead, but also for a little film called [[ASIN:079284131X Child's Play]] this that might just be the case. Prey is a nail biting thriller about an African doll called \\"This is he who hunts\\" comes to life and starts attacking its owner. Although I don't know for sure whether or not this story inspired Childs Play, it is very safe to bet that the director of that film must have read this book and used it in some way. Although there are parts in this story that just don't make much sense (how can a doll overpower a full grown woman?) it is none the less a very entertaining read. If you liked Childs Play, you'll love this gem.<br /><br />With War, 7 pages, 3/5. Huh?<br /><br />Now this is a strange one indeed. Matheson goes for the surreal and the supernatural in this story even more so then previously, but in the end this story is just too off the wall to be taken seriously. set in an alternate world (or possibly WWI, its hard to tell) Witch War starts off with seven cute little girls talking happily with each other about, well, girl stuff. Gossip, cloths, hairstyles, stuff like that. Then a soldier enters the room and informs them of an upcoming attack.<br />\\"Oh my, here we go again,\\" one of them says.<br /><br />Outside in the rain a group of soldiers, supported by trucks and tanks, are attempting to attack the city the girls are supposedly in. Out of nowhere lightning starts to strike, lions and tigers jump out of the rain, the tanks blow up in huge fireballs and the mud starts to consume the troops as they run; you know, friendly stuff like that. Although this is an interesting story, I can hardly say it's up to the high standard set by previous entries.<br /><br />Dance of the Dead, 19 pages, 3/5. Leaves too many questions unanswered.<br /><br />I know I know, I said the same thing about Buried Talents and still gave that story a 4, so why not this one? Well, because this story tries to be a little more ambitious. For one thing it's longer and has room to expand and answer some of the questions it raises, and for another it creates a whole different world that is never explained or elaborated on. Set, I guess, some time in the not so distant future, the government is in a weakened state in the aftermath of a devastating war. four teenagers go on a trip to the city to see what they call the \\"Loopy Dance.\\" a Loopy, apparently, is a dead corpse that reanimates because of some chemical and does a strange kind of dance. Although the dystopian future intrigued me, nothing really happens of interest during this story, and that's the main reason for the lower rating.<br /><br />Dress of White Silk, 6 pages, 4.5/5. What just happened?<br /><br />That was my immediate reaction after reading Dress of White Silk. What happened? What did that ending mean? Although I have my guesses, there really is no way to know for sure that I'm right or wrong (don't worry, I won't spoil it for you). Written in the head of a young girl, maybe 7 years old give or take, this story is very simply written to say the least. Here's an example of the kind of writing you can expect.<br /><br />Pg , 213. \\"When I pretend I brush my hair long. But I only use my own brush from my room. I didn't neveruse mommas brush.\\"<br /><br />Although this kind of writing can be a little hard to get though, it is very appropriate for the kind of story being told. It's told though the mind of a very little girl after all, so this incomplete writing is very nice to see and shows the versatility of Matheson. The ending is what truly got me hooked on this. It seems that almost every ending in this book is brilliant.<br /><br />Mad house, 72 pages, 5/5. Inspiration for Monster House?<br /><br />Yes, once again, Matheson delivers another inspiration for another movie, this time the kids film [[ASIN:B000IFRT2Y Monster House (Widescreen Edition)]], although the book itself is anything but kid friendly. Mad House is about struggling writer/professor whose life is leaving him and can't seem to control his anger. The angrier he gets, the more accidents he starts to have around the house. A rug slips out from under his feet, a pencil points break off and sticks into his finger, his chair falls down, ect. His friend warns him that he's afraid that if he doesn't control his anger, his house might actually turn on him, which of course is exactly what happens.<br /><br />This is one of the longer stories in this book, and also one of the best. The story makes the main character is sole focus, diving into he mind and fleshing out what kind of person he really is. Along with Robert Neville from I Am Legend, the main character from this story (I can't remember his name right now) is probably one of the best characters in this book. The story really is about him, at least up until Matheson gives us yet ANOTHER killer ending. My God, how many can be pull off?<br /><br />The Funeral, 10 pages, 3/5. My least favorite.<br /><br />Why is that? Well, because it's a not so funny comedy about vampires and goblins and such. a man tries to run a funeral home when a vampire walks in and say he wants a funeral because the one he had in real life wasn't that great and now he wants to make up for it. What follows is a somewhat humorous tale as all his vampire friends come for the ceremony and try to eat the poor owner. Overall a nice story but nothing great.<br /><br />From Shadowed Places, 25 pages, 4/5. Warning, graphic content ahead.<br /><br />This is, far and away, the most graphic of all the stories in this book. Naked people galore, African voodoo, more naked people, lots and lots of sexual content so if that's not your cup of tea stay away. The story itself really isn't half bad. A man is being tortured by some African witch doctor and is slowly dieing a horrible death. When his fianc&eacute; calls for help, they get their friend Dr. Howl, a woman who just happens to have been taught all about African voodoo while on a trip to the Dark Continent. But the only way she can get the voodoo out of him is to, uhh, get naked and pretend to be having sex with him, no kidding. Still a very good read.<br /><br />Person to Person, 23 pages, 5/5. The second best.<br /><br />After I Am Legend, Person to Person is my favorite story here. When a man starts hearing a phone in his head, he tries to find a way to make it stop, but to no avail. When he gets the bright idea to answer the phone (in his head of course) a mysterious stranger starts talking to him on the other end. Who is this man? A government agent testing a new way of communication? An inventor using him as a guinea pig? His long dead father? His uncounsis mind? Every time he \\"answers\\" the phone, he gets a different story. Little does he know that this voice in his mind has sinister plans for him. This story also has one heck of an ending. I'm surprised no one has made this story into a movie or something.<br /><br />OVERVIEW.<br /><br />You must read this book, whether or not you are a fan of the movies. This horror classic inspired so many movies and books it's not even funny. It inspired Romero's Night of the Living Dead, which inspired every other zombie movie every made, enough said. No horror fan can affordto be without this classic book.

B000VNMMRA|4.0|Smart move on Fox's part to release the movie in theaters as a friendlier PG-13 affair, all to release the UNRATED version on DVD months later to entice the \\"die hard\\" fans who were annoyed at the less foul mouthed version into buying it. I don't necessarily agree with the guerilla marketing tactics but at the very least we now have the film the way it was meant to be seen.<br /><br />Truth be told, there's really nothing in this film that makes it anything but R-rated and it's not even a hard R. The \\"Unrated\\" tag isn't warranted at all here, so if you're expecting to see something unreal in terms of violence, you're going to be sorely let down. The main difference between the unrated and theatrical versions (which are both on this set) is the language. There's definitely a lot more swearing this time around and it's a welcome return to form to hear McClane talking the way he normally does. It seems that the bullet hits are slightly bloodier but other than that the differences in terms of actual scenes are very minimal. If I have any beef with this film, it's that they've turned McClane into an indestructible supercop as opposed to the earlier, more human hero of the first couple of films. Here you have McClane jumping from jets, which is probably one of the most ridculous things you'll ever see. Still, I found it to be really enjoyable and quite hilarious. The villain could be better but hey, Hans Gruber is a hard act to follow.<br /><br />The presentation on this DVD is very nice, sporting a crisp picture and very active surround sound to heighten the onscreen action. The DVD has a load of bonus features, the best being the feature length behind the scenes documentary on the second disc. It covers just about all the bases on the films production and it's one of the more entertaining pieces I've seen on a film production. There are other bonus features that are worth mentioning like the Guyz Nite music video which frankly, I find to be hilarious. There's a making of the video that's kinda blah and there's also an interview with Bruce Willis conducted by fellow cast member Kevin Smith which I enjoyed.<br /><br />Highly recommended!'s kinda blah and there's also an interview with Bruce Willis conducted by fellow cast member Kevin Smith which I enjoyed.     Highly recommended!
B000UR9T82|1.0|I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH \\"ginnyww\\". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects.
B000UJ48O0|5.0|Very nice set and at a great price!   Free shipping made it a no-brainer!
0385522401|1.0|This was the most boring, pointless, and depressing novel I have ever read.  Luckily it only took a couple of hours since it's not very long. Set in the 1960s, the tone is more like the 1860s.  It is difficult to believe that anyone in the '60s could be as naive and stupid as this couple.  Don't waste your money, don't waste your time.
6305128952|4.0|This is a great movie, very warm and comforting.  It is about how things are connected, fall apart and come back together.  I highly recommend.
B000J4QWM2|4.0|Be aware that there are two versions of this film on DVD.  The Director's Cut is the version I THINK was in the theatres, and this version is slightly different.<br /><br />This version opens with the nightclub scene instead of the go-fast boat sequence (which is not in this version at all).  For the rest of the first half of the film it is essentially identical to the Director's Cut.<br /><br />In the second half, in this version there are additional scenes on the transport ship, a longer build-up to the now-extended sequence at the trailer park, and the drug sting and shootout is longer too.<br /><br />There is an additional sequence with Tubbs' girlfriend Trudy getting nabbed by Yero's thugs, more footage in the hospital, and a different scene where Yero informs Montoya of Isabella's relationship with Crockett.<br /><br />I've seen the Director's Cut several times and bought this previously-viewed DVD not knowing there was a different cut of the film.  Naturally, it was a bit disconcerting watching the second half of this one.  One side of my brain is watching and sort of enjoying the new take on it, and the other half of my brain is contemplating whether or not to buy the Director's Cut DVD too, because that was the movie I wanted to buy from the get-go.<br /><br />You get more bonus features with the Director's Cut.  This one, however, is a bare-bones edition.<br /><br />Be sure to take note before purchasing. Be careful discerning between the cover box artwork on each DVD.  The picture in the Amazon listing may or may not stay accurate as time moves forward, so keep alert.<br /><br />*******************************************************<br /><br />08/07/09 edit:  Some pressings of the Blu-ray version of the Unrated Director's Cut may have an audio glitch at the 89 minute mark.  It is a horrible screeching, like fingernails running down a chalkboard, and it lasts about a minute or so.  I went through 3 different discs from 3 different stores and they all had the same defect.  Perhaps that explains the recent price drop on the Blu-ray.p on the Blu-ray.
B000UD0ESA|4.0|The video and audio on this DVD are truly amazing. Easily the best restoration since the BOND films.   The documentary is as good as that of Ridley's other films (GLADIATOR, ALIEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN), in other words, the best of any DVD out there.  I'm not really a BLADE RUNNER freak like so many people but with editions like this (at more than reasonable prices), who can say no ?
B00005Y6YB|5.0|We just finished watching Comanche Moon.  It was very well done. My family has a tradition of watching Lonesome Dove every other year. We were all looking forward to this Comanche Moon series. Karl Urban and Steve Zahn did a fantastic job, and they had very big boots to fill.  I have been in love with Gus for many years.  Even though I think Steve Zahn is a good and funny actor, I was worried that he would not pull this character off.  He nailed Gus.  Thanks to all who made this film.  Now what are we going to do?
0446677450|5.0|This is a must-read if you want to improve your personal finances.  This book is one of my top 5 when it comes to managing your money because it focuses first on how to think like rich people think instead of trying to copy what they do.  The author does this by pointing to the example and advice from his biological father (poor dad) and his best friend's father (rich dad).  He does an excellent job of taking you back to his childhood and what shaped his thinking about life and money.  He learned valuable lessons from both Dads.  One of the important lessons I learned is to focus on the education from the job you are performing more than the wage.  If you can work very hard for low or no pay, you already on the right track to building wealth.  There are many other very good concepts presented in this book including what is an asset.  The CD audiobook is very easy to follow and listen to in your car.  Go for it!
B000002J5K|2.0|\\"The Blues Brothers\\" film has two of the transcendant moments of rock & soul music - Aretha Franklin's revisiting \\"Think\\" and Ray Charles' high octane take on \\"Shake a Tail Feather.\\"  So why, on this soundtrack CD, did the producers choose other versions?  And what's with all the fadeouts?  It's not like there wasn't room on the cd.  The Ray Charles recording has much less energy than the one on the film, and the Franklin cut doesn't seem as tight.  Plus \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" omits most of the solos.  This could be a great soundtrack, but it deserves a much better treatment than it receives here.
B000O179FE|4.0|Sadly, prior to buying this HD-DVD, I have never viewed this movie before.<br /><br />It is a movie I have been wanting to see, but never got around to watching, until just now.<br /><br />And wow, this is a beautiful movie, the chemistry between the 2 leads is amazing, Bill Murray plays this wonderful character, he is in a different culture, doesn't know what he is doing, and just enjoys, and embraces whats happening.  It is a really great movie, I never expected to enjoy this as much as I did.<br /><br />The hd-dvd has a few features (a 30 minute behind the scenes, which is ok), and a 10 minute interview with Bill Murray and The writer / director.  This is a great interview, and I really wish this movie had an audio commentary or (even better) an IME.<br /><br />The video quality left me wanting more, it never really shines, it isn't really sharp, I really cant see this looking that good.  It's about the quality of broadcast television on HD, but without the nice sharp contrast, deep blacks, and sharp details.  Then again, this movie doesn't really need it.<br /><br />So for an HD-DVD I give it a 3 (out of 5) because of the video quality<br /><br />Extras I give a 3 (really good interview, and a nice behind the scenes, plus some other cool extras), sadly no commentary. (but we do get some deleted scenes, one or two that really shine)<br /><br />The movie I give a 5 out of 5.  I will gladly watch this movie again, I just really love this movie, I cant say exactly why, but you do fall in love with the characters, the situations, the atmosphere, it's just really special, you should see it.<br /><br />I hope one day, they will re-release this wonderful movie, and remaster the video and add an audio commentary from the writer / director, Sofia Coppola.
0743201140|5.0|I've read \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and \\"StrengthsFinder 2.0\\" and have taken both assessments. These books and the assessments explore what's right with people.  I really enjoyed \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" and support the concept of leading through strength. I enjoyed reading about the various strength categories, how to manage people with different strengths, and building a strengths-based organization. When I took the original Strengthsfinder assessment which is provided with the book, it was an interesting experience, but I didn't get much additional value.  The book is far more substantive.    The Strengthsfinder 2.0 book didn't provide me with me substantially more insight than this book. The assessment is a slightly more customized, and the action steps can help with implementation. I still can't figure out why one of my five strengths was not included in my original strengthfinder assessment. How could my strengths change in two days?    Discovering and employing strengths is undoubtedly worthwhile, so here's your choice. If you want the most substantive information, read this book. If you are more interested in the personalization of strengths, then take the Strengthsfinder 2.0 assessment. The Strengthsfinder 2.0 book is not nearly as impressive as this book.     If you are interested in making the most of your thinking, interactions and any situation, I absolutely recommend the Optimal Thinking Online Assessment, a brilliant supplement to the Optimal Thinking book. Because thoughts are the parents of performance, I believe this is the most powerful assessment in the marketplace.

B000B8IA2G|4.0|What is Stargate Atlantis?<br /><br />Stargate Atlantis is an offshoot of the popular (though now canceled) television show, Stargate SG-1. It follows the adventures of a band of explorers who enter the Pegasus Galaxy through means of an ancient traveling device known as the Stargate. Once there they find themselves in the lost city of Atlantis, and within several hours of setting up base, they tick off the locals, nearly destroy Atlantis forever, are not able to call back home and awaken the most feared and terrible enemy known to mankind, the Wraith.<br /><br />The team of explorers then come together to create a force against the Wraith, fighting them with all the help Earth is able to give, in terms of both technology and Earth's people, who are shown as caring and brave. They set out to win the hearts of the people of the Pegasus Galaxy, offering help where ever they can, learning new techniques and secrets from a myriad of different cultures and civilizations.<br /><br />Stargate Atlantis is a very good watch. The graphics are very nice, the characters are sci-fi believable and endearing. The Wraith make for some very good bad guys and the story lines are enjoyable. The first season is a little shaky, in terms of figuring out story-lines and character developments, but all issues are quite grounded by the second season.<br /><br />It's not necessary to know or have seen the Stargate SG-1 series to enjoy Stargate Atlantis, as the Stargate SG-1 characters make only a brief cameo appearance in the first episodes of this season. However, in the second and third season of Atlantis, they come in quite a bit more. So some knowledge of the SG-1 is helpful, thought still not necessary to enjoy Atlantis.<br /><br />Little kids will find this show too scary, as the Wraith are a species of albino looking aliens that \\"feed\\"  by draining the life force out of humans. Some of the story lines are a little complex for the younger viewer as well. But what you won't find in Atlantis are scantily clad women bearing their all. One of the things that makes Atlantis an awesome show. Respect for the characters.<br /><br /> As a connoisseur of Science Fiction, I rate the Stargate series as one of the best on television. Endearing characters, enjoyable story-lines and great graphics all add up to make this the kind of show you want to have in your collection.ir all.

B000OCZD5G|5.0|This is really the one that started it all. The movie that every other post-apocalyptic film has ever tried to live up to but never could. The Road Warrior is the best of it's kind and is still top of the heap in this style of film. Among the many clones that have come out since, none come close to The Road Warrior. I much prefer this one to the original 'Mad Max' and it's way better than it's weak sequel 'Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome'. I've watched this movie many times over the years since the 80's and it holds up as well today as it did then. There's just nothing else like it.<br /><br />The Road Warrior starts as every movie should, with action. This one in the form of a chase. It soon becomes apparent that fuel is the most precious resource (not too unlike today), and gangs of insane madmen are running wild everywhere seeking control by violence and by possessing said fuel. Max soon finds himself in the middle of a fuel dispute between 2 warring factions. One who controls a fuel depot surrounded by a guarded outpost and the other, a sadistic murderous gang who'll stop at nothing to gain control of it by killing anyone and everyone who stands in their way. Eventually allied with one side, events come to a climax in the form of a spectacular multi-vehicle chase that ranks among the greatest in movie history.<br /><br />Max is a complex character. Once a former cop but now a man alone trying to survive in a desolate wasteland, still haunted by the loss of his wife and child who were brutally murdered. Struggling with moral decisions in an immoral world. A world where it's survival of the fittest. After being alone for so long, we find out if any of his old self still exists. Can he heed a call for help and work with others or will he continue to only look after himself?<br /><br />Suprisingly, the leader of a large murderous gang named Humongus is deeper than you'd expect. He's a massive monster of a man. So hideous that he has to wear a hockey mask to cover what must be a disfigured face. He's clearly leader by size and strength but also brains. Constantly trying to outwit the group who guards the precious fuel, he deviously negotiates with them over a microphone, using anything and anyone and playing on their hopes and fears to try to convince them to come out.<br /><br />The video on the Blu-Ray is outstanding. This is a very good transfer as it's light years beyond any other offering on vhs and dvd. The image is sharp, clear and mostly clean of dirt. There are more details than have ever been seen before. Whether it be by skin and clothing textures or the beat up vehicles and desert scenery. The colors look much more vivd too. Excellent overall. Unfortunately, the audio is still very front loaded. It's basically a stereo mix. The sounds, especially the motors of the cars, the dialog and sound effects are clear and sound better than they have before but I feel this movie really deserves and overhaul in the form of a real 5.1 mix. There's enough chases, gunshots and explosions, to make you imagine how good it could be with a dramatic remix. Seeing as how well it worked for 'Blade Runner', it could be done here. Overall though, it still sounds good enough to get you involved with the picture.<br /><br />This is a classic film that's lost nothing over the years. It's still fun and defintely worth a look if your curious. If your already a fan, the high def versions (which are identical) are an easy, no brainer upgrade over previous versions. Another impressive addition to your catalog.e. He's clearly leader by size and strength but also brains.

I just wanted to get in here and comment that this book is well written and kept me caught up in the story all the way to the end.  It is escape in it's purest form.  Don't look for reality here but get caught up in what COULD happen!  Lot's of intensity at the end and entertainment all the way.

B000K15VSA|5.0|I had been waiting for this Ultimate version of the movie and in this sort of packaging for years, but the main question as a buyer is 'was a real effort was made to deserve our money'. After seeing some previous Special Editions/Director's Cuts of Ridley Scott's films, I had an idea of what we might expect . It is hard to believe that some would still be unhappy with this incredible presentation of Blade Runner, but that is the way fans are.<br /><br />The set (preordering through Amazon) cost me less than a third of the Australian price, so I cannot complain.<br /><br />For those who have never seen it, the film is amazing and haunting , in some ways sad. I feel it means more as one becomes older. My only reservation about the film is the way it tries to be many things at once, but maybe that is its charm.<br />It is definitely a classic and perhaps those who don't like it don't like the underlying message which may be - think about yourself and what you have accomplished. Are you happy with that ?<br /><br />If not, the film may be difficult to sit through.<br /><br />A great film, beautfully presented in a package to hand down to the Nexus, sorry , NEXT generation.

0525950079|5.0|Several years ago a friend of mine introduced me to Ken Follet by way of Pillars of the Earth.  At the time I hadn't really read much historical fiction and was skeptical about how good it would be. When I started it, I couldn't get enough of it.  When it was over I was happy and sad.  Happy because it was without a doubt the best book I have EVER read, and sad because it was over.    When Follett announed that he was making a 'sequel' I was trepidatious about it.  What would it be about?  Would it have the same feel that had me so captivated while reading Pillars of the Earth? The answer to that question is a resounding YES.    World without end takes place primarily in Kingsbridge, the location of Pillars of the Earth.  This is a couple of centuries later though and some of the main characters are decendants from those in the original novel.      Follet recaptures the magic of Pillars of the Earth.  We're introduced to the core characters early on and we see them live out their lives over the course of decades.  A book is only as good as its characters and I found myself wondering about them even when I WASN'T reading it.  That is truly the mark of a good author.  I found myself mimicing the moods of the people I was reading about.  When they were happy, I was happy, when they were sad, I was sad.  It's not often that you feel the plight of fictional characters and as with POE, that's what makes World Without End utterly captivating from the first page to the last.    The drama of the characters' every day lives as it unfolds from page to page, year to year, decade to decade as time passes in the book is nothing short of brilliant.  Life and death, love and loss, triumph and defeat, good and evil.  Follet develops characters that you love to love and characters that you love to absolutely detest.  The adversity they encounter and the plight of their everyday lives sucks you into the book and after a short while, you can't help but fall in love with the characters.At just over 1000 pages it may seem daunting to some, but beleive me, at the end you'll wish it were longer.    I simply cannot say enough good things about this book.  Pillars of the Earth is my favorite book of all time and I don't think anything will supplant it in its place, but this book is so close that calling it my 'second favorite' would be doing it an injustice.    For fans of Ken Follet or Pillars of the Earth or even historical fiction in general, you'd be doing yourself a disservice by not getting your hands on this book!

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I understand that many would give the movie less stars that it deserves because it's not word by word by the book. However it is a movie - there will always be moments and scenes missing especially when we talk about the subtle ones. It is impossible to make the movie like the book second my second, it just won't work. I love reading Austen, but this is not about reading it. I won't compare the book to the movie, but judge the movie on it's on. (Even the Pride and Prejudice of '94 isn't that faithful to the book and yet everyone's gaga over it :)    Now, I personally loved the movie. it was tastefully done, the cinematography was marvelous, and the characters were very convincing without overpowering one another. The suspense was built very nicely and the music, which indeed might be a bit of a cliche BBC, was appropriately used. I was moved by all of the characters and I think they were perfectly cast. I have seen the previous version (1999) and this one I like far better. Despite all of the missing bit and pieces from the book I will still say that the screenplay and adaptation were done very good indeed. It evokes the same emotions of the book and that's what counts (to me at least).  I highly recommend this movie to all Austen fans. It is worth your time!

B000LC55F2|3.0|Take two rival magicians, then make their rivalry intensely personal. As their mutual hatred increases, they become consumed by their need for revenge, to the point where they really don't care who gets hurt in the crossfire. The Prestige is a bleak story based upon the destructive power of obsession and self absorption. Ultimately, neither of the antagonists retains much of his humanity and while at the conclusion, one appears to be the victor, even that is largely illusory. This movie is not so much entertaining as intriguing. Jackman, Bale, and Bowie each did outstanding jobs playing cold, dark characters that are passionate but somehow reptilian, with Michael Caine providing some rational relief.
B000002B7S|5.0|I give \\"Bark At the Moon\\" five stars based solely on the quality of the songs.  It has nothing to do with the remastering of the CD or the extra track (although I am glad to see other people are a bit upset at the \\"remastered\\" version on chain music store shelves).<br /><br />The extra instrumentation on Ozzy's albums is really unnecessary.  As previous reviewers have suggested, why can't the original album just be re-released and let whoever wants the extra stuff have it?  (As for me, I'm a stickler for the original.)<br /><br />\\"Bark At the Moon\\" is my all-time favorite Ozzy solo album.  There were multiple copies of this floating around in my house in the '80s because it was played so much.  This has to be Ozzy's most underrated album.  I read an interview a few years ago where he stated that this was his least favorite album, but I don't see why (apart from the fact that it was his first album without Randy Rhodes on guitar).  It's chock full of strong, original material.<br /><br />One tune especially sums up his entire career: \\"Rock and Roll Rebel.\\"  If that doesn't described Ozzy in a nutshell ...<br /><br />The beginning of \\"Centre of Eternity\\" always had me putting the needle back or rewind the tape numerous times.  \\"You're No Different\\" gave me a view into hypocrisy at a young age, and \\"So Tired\\" is one of the best slow songs ever,  I also love the melody for \\"Waiting for Darkness.\\"  (And the video for the title track is a real treat!)<br /><br />Every Ozzy solo album (except his newer ones) I love from beginning to end, but \\"Bark At the Moon\\" stands out for me as a cut above the rest.  - Donna Di Giacomo

This album is the fulfillment of her artistic dream.\\" ~ Joel E. Siegel , Liner Notes, 1992 ~<br /><br />This exquisite album, \\"Here's To Life,\\" was dedicated by Shirley Horn to Miles Davis, who was supposed to play solo on \\"A Time For Love\\" and \\"Quietly There\\" but did not happen due to his untimely death. It is a monumental collaboration between two of the most prominent names in the music world. Shirley Horn was not only a gifted singer, but also a talented pianist who once said that her most significant influence as a jazz pianist was Oscar Peterson and she declared: \\"He's my Rachmaninoff.\\" Her versatility is evident in the way she presented a repertoire of eleven of the greatest songs ever recorded backed by a 49-piece orchestra flawlessly handled by Johnny Mandel, a brilliant arranger, masterful conductor, creative film scorer, savvy producer and remarkable composer all rolled into one. I have collected most of his impressive recordings with Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Chet Baker, Quincy Jones, Toots Thielemans, Natalie Cole, Diana Krall, John Pizzarelli and David Sanborn, among others.<br /><br />Mr. Mandel and Ms. Horn have created an amazing musical tour de force in this enchantingly romantic album worthy to any music lover who has an ear for beautiful music and an appreciation for the creative talents and collaborative efforts of Shirley Horn, Johnny Mandel, Wynton Marsalis, Alan Broadbent (one of my favorite jazz pianists whom I have watched perform live at Spazio), and all the musicians involved in making this as one of the most beautiful jazz albums ever recorded. Thanks to the superb orchestration and lovely arrangements of Mr. Mandel, who brings out the very best in all the artists that he has worked with. This is my own tribute to his extraordinary artistry. Mr. Mandel, who turned 82 last November 23, 2007, is one of the greatest and unparalleled composers of all-time. The multi-Grammy awardee's brilliant and creative contributions to the music industry can never ever go unappreciated. He is one remarkable musician who truly adds sheer beauty and perfection to any kind of music.<br /><br />I'm head-over-heels in love with \\"A Time For Love,\\" a Johnny Mandel original song co-written with Paul Francis Webster. Wynton Marsalis' sweepingly beautiful trumpet solo adds passion to Ms. Horn's dramatic treatment.<br /><br />\\"A time for summer skies<br />For humming birds and butterflies<br />For tender words that harmonize with love\\"<br /><br />I'm affectionately fond of a medley, \\"Come A Little Closer\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" interpreted dramatically in a slow, mellow, smooth and velvety manner.<br /><br />I'm sentimentally moved by \\"Where Do You Start?\\" done in an achingly beautiful fashion that makes it the album's emotional highlight.  This is another Johnny Mandel original, penned by a great songwriting team, Alan and Marilyn Bergman.<br /><br />I'm totally smitten with \\"How Am I To Know?\\" and \\"Return To Paradise.\\" These are the only tracks with fabulously upbeat arrangements seasoned with Latin flavors.<br /><br />I'm endlessly spellbound by the final track, \\"Estat&eacute;\\" (Summer), an Italian song co-written by Bruno Martino and  Bruno Brighetti, with English lyrics by Joel E.

B000EQH2QK|2.0|I like Shakira..I do. I really have enjoyed her spanish albums but for some reason, in my opinion, she has not made a successful transition into english, despite a couple of hits. While her spanish lyrics are poetic and deep, her english lyrics are laughable and quite simply, silly. I was very eager when Laundry Service came out but I thought it was a failure..i.e Underneath your Clothes could have been a masterpiece but she killed it with things like \\"For being such a good girl honey\\", that is just childish...and the trend of childish and silly english lyrics continues herem an example would be in Don't Bother..another song that could've been excellent had she not gone overboard with the silliness \\"I beat her at that one good  Don't you think so?  She's almost six feet tall  She must think I'm a flea  I'm really a cat you see  And it's not my last life at all\\"  I'm sorry, that is just pure silliness.  And it seems she has an obsession with her \\"humble\\" breasts because she keeps mentioning them, in Costume Makes the Clown, makes an allusion to them in \\"Don't Bother\\" and also in \\"Whenever, Wherever\\".  I believe that when she writes the lyrics, she is still thinking in spanish and it shows, it shows the literal translation and the use of the language..Also, I found there the album is not cohesive..she jumps from one genre to another.   I think that she should surround herself with native english songwriters next time she releases an album in english, again, I LOVE her spanish albums and the lyrics are great but in english, they just fall short. I've tried many times to listen to this album and everytime I just find myself thinking how childish and stupid the lyrics sound. I do applaud her effort to cross over and she is definitely a better singer than Enrique Iglesias will ever be (who told him he could sing anyway???).
B000YIGNKE|1.0|They did one thing I liked: Captain Benwick was well cast and the scenes between him and Anne really worked, though they would have worked better if they'd used Jane Austen's dialog.<br /><br />If I could I'd give this zero stars because:<br /><br />*Jane Austen's novels are more than romances -- this version tries to turn PERSUASION into a romance novel, pure and simple. It leaves out every nuance of character, every side plot (including the Crofts' marriage, which in the book and the 1995 film version contrasted so painfully with Anne's situation), and doesn't even hold together as a film in its own right!<br /><br />*instead of the novel's dramatic conclusion (when Captain Wentworth is writing the letter while Anne is talking about women \\"loving longest\\" -- for some bizarre reason, this speech was edited and then moved to the middle of the film), this script writer has Anne running around Bath.....<br /><br />*many, many scenes are cut, and replaced by Anne sighing, or crying, while sad music plays...the opening sequence didn't even really make sense.<br /><br />*the casting (with the exception of Captain Benwick and maybe Anne herself) was off: Captain Wentworth would NOT look young and cute - with a practically unlined face - after all those years in the English navy; Mary was TOO pretty, Elizabeth not nearly pretty enough; the Harvilles, instead of being warm and welcoming were shown only when Captain Harville LECTURED Captain Wentworth (another scene invented by the truly terrible writer)<br /><br />*all the comic scenes were cut (Mrs.Musgrove's \\"large fat sighings,\\" for example), as was one of the MOST romantic ones: hen Anne is trying to take care of one nephew while another hangs round her neck -- remember how in the book Captain Wentworth simply walks up to her and firmly removes the child?<br /><br />SURELY there are better writers out there! Why didn't they hire one?
0743277457|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! It is fascinating and thrilling and powerful! Highly recommended!

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion with Amanda Root and cast is gorgeously filmed and quietly rendered.  I have recently (Jan. 13, 2008) had the pleasure of watching Masterpiece Theater's latest production of Persuasion and it is very good, too.  But, much as I enjoyed the casting in the new rendition, they can't hold a candle to Amanda Root as Anne Eliot, Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth, and other cast members.  There is a tender and quiet aching in this classic not quite as palpable in other productions.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|All I have to say is, this cd is pretty good. Although I think there is a hidden message. (lol)
B000W99IK2|5.0|These two Schubert pairings are pure vintage Karajan from roughly the same era as his first Beethoven cycle - the Unfinished dates from 1964, the C Major \\"Great\\" from 1968. He returned to both scores for EMI when he exited DG for a period in the Seventies; on the whole, there's no improvement in the remake, so these are the preferred recordings, to which I'd add Karajan's early rendition of the Unfinished with the Philharmonia (coupled with a great Brahms Second on an EMI budget release, easily found on the used market). There is also a third recording of the Ninth, according to a note inside this CD, but I've never encountered it.<br /><br />To his fans, Karajan's controlled conducting is mesmerizing, delivering a continuous musical experience of remarkable consistency from first note to last; to his detractors the effect is impersonal and perhaps even corporate. I'm a fan, but not an uncritical one, so I judge each release on its own. In this case, the connection between conductor and musicians mostly helps Schubert - Karajan's pacing in the second movement of the Unfinished, for example, is very steady, which might feel inflexible, but in this case it serves as a backdrop for very sensitive, expressive solo playing from the woodwinds. In the first movement the intention seems to be, as with his Beethoven, to lay down a legacy reading that says, \\"This is how German music should sound.\\" Nothing unusual happens, yet everything seems perfectly in place. (My objection to Karl Bohm, another legacy conductor, is that he really does sound impersonal.)<br /><br />The Ninth begins a a reasonable walking pace, with a considerable acceleration in the main Allegro. This, too, was standard German practice, although some conductors (Furtwangler, Knappertsbusch) might be slower in the introduction and not speed up quite as much later. Today the favored practice is often to speed both up considerably. the second movement is unusually fast for the period. The program notes consist of two paragraphs devoted to Karajan's iffy relationship to the Schubert Ninth, which he rarely programmed and which he claimed not to understand. (Oddly, the note goes on to quote the Gramophone's negative review of this Ninth, complaining that he skated over the score's beauties. I don't hear that. Karajan wasn't a robotic conductor, and by paying attention one notices detail and nuance,  slightly adjusted phrasing and surges of energy, that keep the performance from feeling routine.  One minor thing: for all his insistence on polished ensemble, in the Sixties Karajan allowed the Berlin brass to sound a bit rough and blatty - he hadn't yet homogenized the orchestra's sonority to an extreme degree.<br /><br />Packaging and sonics might be an issue for some - the package is a hinged cardboard sleeve with  no notes on the music, only the two paragraphs about Karajan that I've cited. The remaastering is successful - no digital glare - and since the recording venue was the Jesus-Christus-Kirche in Berlin, considered a better hall than the Philharmonie, the overall balances are natural. In fact, there's less reverberation than in some DG recordings of the period, and the orchestral sonority isn't as grandiose as in the EMI Schubert cycle. But these are subjective comments; without a doubt both of these readings are on a grand scale. the engineers have left in noticeable analog tape hiss, which is more prominent in the Unfinished than the Ninth.<br /><br />I've tried to give an objective description of two readings that were controversial in their day. My personal response has improved over the years, and now I'll keep Karajan's vintage Schubert next to admired recordings of the Unfinished and Ninth by Furtwangler, Walter,Klemperer, Bernstein, and Sinopoli.of two paragraphs devoted to Karajan's iffy relationship to the Schubert Ninth, which he rarely programmed and which he claimed not to understand.

B000ETQPYM|3.0|This is a very poorly written book. Certain aspects of this book made me feel like I was reading the story of an 18 year old opposed to 30. The main character, Holly, is likeable in a cute college kid kind of way. She goes through a rough patch which makes her act in certain ways but the whole documentary video and getting lost at sea situations are just over the top. The book is very easy to read, if you didn't read up on the author you would think that it was written by a 5th grader but overall the book was OK. Near the end I got tired of all her childish and inmature escapades.
B000G2YD3C|5.0|For a short period of time in 2006 Pure Reason Revolution looked like they might be the shining star for the future of progressive rock.  They were signed to a major label (a rarity for prog bands these days) and received a lot of hype upon the album's release.  Unfortunately less than a year later Sony would drop them like a hot potato and they would be forced back to independent label status.  A situation that is very similar to Sony's treatment of Echolyn back in the late 90's.  Major label or not this is a damn fine album, in fact it was one of my favorite releases of 2006, and simply put I love this disc.  The band has a modern sound, but manages to incorporate elements of classic progressive rock as well.  A post-rock influence can be found here as well making the album a challenging yet accessible listen.  The liberal use of duel male and female vocals is captivating with lyrics that paint visual pictures of a science fiction theme.  There is no one here that really stands out instrumentally, but the band as a whole gels into a fine cohesive unit.  I got to see the band live at NEARfest last year and unfortunately was slightly disappointed in their live show.  The band had lost one of its members just prior to the show and also had a really muddy sound mix.  I would really like to get the chance to catch them again at some point.  Overall I give this album my highest recommendation.  To me this is what good modern progressive rock is all about.
B00003CXBK|5.0|We bought this movie, and a few others like it.  I love it.  It's incredible- the animations is stunning.  Maybe even better than Spirited Away.  It does say PG-13, but my nine year old watched it- not really anything that's not in the movies (less frightening that Lord of the Rings- if your kid can watch those kinds of things- mine hasn't yet- then they will probably be okay watching this).  If you're child is younger, Kiki's Delivery or Totoro is a great option.    The only way this movie could've maybe been better is if they stuck it on an IMAX screen.  (That would be a great way for the US to be introduced more widely to anime.)

0618918248|5.0|Whilst Dawkins normally writes excellent books for the general reader on evolution and the wonder of scientific discovery, this book explores a new line of thought.    Clearly concerned by the assumptions that underpin and promote Intelligent Design, Dawkins challenges and pushes back on religion trying to over-write and undermine discoveries made about the origin of the species on Earth.    This book really made me think hard about the thoughts and ideas I had grown up and encouraged me to read further around this topic, such as Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris.     I liked reading about Gould's non-overlapping magisteria and the fatal mistake made by Intelligent Design advocates that made this book essential.    Read it, discuss it, think about it, it is not often something so provocative comes along. My favourite Dawkins is Unweaving the Rainbow on the sheer beauty of all that surrounds us, when seen through different eyes.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a great movie. If you like \\"The Princess Bride\\", fun fantasy or romantic tales, you'll like this one, too. It was lost amongst the usual summer loudness and the studio didn't seem to know how to market it, so it's likely to have been missed, but that's a shame. The cast as a whole is great, esp. Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer (and Dinero in certainly a different role for him), the sweeping sountrack and visuals really suck you in, but it's the whimsy and charm that make it memorable. I recommend you watch it and if you loved it, tell all your friends.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I waited for this to come out on DVD and wasted my money renting the bloody thing. Like many reviewers have said: either love it or hate it. I definitely have a sense of humor, but I really don't understand what was so cool or funny about this movie. Maybe had I been involved in the production of it I'd find enjoyment but it just wasn't my cup of meat!<br /><br />The acting was overkill. Better than your average B-movie, but they all just tried too hard. Napoleon and Pedro were the most annoying, most unbelievable characters I've ever seen. I've known a lot of dorks and dweebs in my life, but these guys were just stereotypical nerdage pushed beyond what was acceptable to me; no one is that dorky, come on!<br /><br />The plot was pathetic beyond any sense of logic. Maybe I should smoke a joint and try watching it again for it to make sense. Following some dork around who spits out lame lines that everyone quotes, only to have no real change in the end, was a huge letdown and made the movie worthless to me.<br /><br />The only saving grace was the dorky dance toward the end. Reminded me of the talent show in Revenge of the Nerds.<br /><br />The bonus features were 1000x's better than the actual movie. You're honestly better off renting this movie and just watching that.<br /><br />I can see how this became popular, as my generation is moving along and the new batch is coming forth, trying to make their impact in today's society. This movie (seems to me) tries to stamp itself as a classic similar to Fast Times At Ridgemount High or The Breakfast Club, just with a different formula. Maybe it's just that it's too different for me and I don't get it.<br /><br />Bottom line: this movie is just way overhyped. Only rent it to say you've seen it. But don't buy it because everyone else tells you to.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|I love all of Springsteen's albums. They all are just amazing and he sure didn't dissapoint with this new one eaither. The first song I was hooked and haven't stopped listening to it since. The Boss still got it!
1400031087|5.0|I know a lot has been said about this book, going both ways: supporting it before and after the admittance to truth. And like another reviewer, I don't give a s--t that it's all lies, or partly lies, or exaggerated. People are just too sensitive in society and are looking for a finger to rest on. They feel `cheated' for being \\"lied\\" to. And to them, you're missing the whole message.<br /><br />I remember when this controversy first cracked wide open, shortly after I read the book. As a writer, I know we can't be 100% accurate with what happened, especially in an autobiography or memoir. Truth is 3 people can look at a scene and come up with 3 different stories ... all of which happen to be true for them. I see someone beating up a person for no reason and someone else can look at it as self-defense. Someone else can look at it still and see a deeply troubled child who never learned how to properly deal with his emotions.<br /><br />My point is, as so many others have pointed out, it doesn't matter at all whether Frey's story is true or not. There are so many books (classical fiction) that capture our souls so deeply that we can't help but cry when something happens; we feel so connected to the characters, to the `story,' that we believe it to be real, to some extent of course. Watching TV shows or movies is another example. The last episode of Six Feet Under had me in tears because I felt like I was losing people very close and dear to me. We get to know the characters so intimately, personally, that we root for them when they're going through a rough time, and cry for them when something awful happens. So Frey's book follows along those same lines. I connected with the characters, felt the pain of addiction (and who among us isn't addicted to SOMETHING in life, be it drugs or money or whatever), and the joy of overcoming something on your own.<br /><br />I know from experience that no matter what program/treatment you receive for a mental disorder, you will ultimately fail if you<br />1. aren't ready and willing to go through with the work that is involved<br />2. don't have the WILL to change your lifestyle<br />I repeated will on purpose, because if someone really wants to change, no matter how `strong' their condition, they can.

B00000255F|5.0|By far one of the best albums ever made. Every song is written beautifully and will be remembered forever. Of course all of Springsteen's albums are great cause he's a genius.
0060558121|2.0|Based on a recommendation from a bookstore employee, I purchased this book with high expectations.  The central premise is intriguing and seemed capable of maintaining a reader's attention through 600 pages.  Boy was I wrong.  Certainly there are interesting and thought provoking passages but there are so many things wrong with this attempt by Gaiman.<br />We never really understand the central character, Shadow, and in the end all of our investment gives way to a horrible anticlimactic and poorly conceived finale.  There are plot elements that are forgotten along the way and those that are tied up feel contrived or overwrought.  Many times I felt like the foreshadowing was thrown in after the book was mostly written.  Many of these elements don't make sense even after the ending becomes clear.  I also found that Gaiman's capitalizing of certain words to be annoying.  I felt he was trying to communicate some hidden meaning about the characters, but after thinking about these elements and investing even more time, nothing came of these allusions.  I felt he used some clever devices and passages along with a number of vignettes to please himself or to use up some material he thought interesting, but none of it ended up adding to the central story.  I agree with many other reviewers that stated they couldn't wait to be finished with this book.
B00005JNTX|5.0|According to \\"The American Monomyth\\" by Jewett and Lawrence (1988), the American monomyth is an \\"an archetypal plot pattern emerging in which a community threatened by evil is redeemed through superheroism.\\" The monomyth is summarized as \\"vigilantism without lawlessness, sexual repression without resultant perversion and moral infallibility without the use of intellect.\\" The three heroes, portrayed by Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and Mickey Rourke, are far from saints, but each resolves to reap justice from the moral wasteland called Sin City. Character development is simple. Males are psycho-killers with a soft-heart for beautiful women; women are cover-girl prostitutes with guns. Bad guys are the psychotic rapists with a penchant for dismemberment. Rourke, Owen and Willis must break all rules to save a woman whose main endearing attribute is that they were once nice to them.<br /><br />This is truly a comic book come to life. Darker and more gruesome than any predecessor, Sin City also more closely adheres to the comic book feel than its brethren. Unlike, say the Hulk, where the cartoonish animated comic book hero seems out of place among real landscapes and real people, in Sin City, everything is equally stylized so that nothing seems too real or too cartoonish. Cars jump hills, men take bullets in the shoulder, characters move in an impossible ways.<br /><br />In Sin City, there is no ultimate truth or final solution. Each hero undergoes a personal battle against inner demons and outer fiends. You don't feel like the city is a place you've been and the characters are not people you ever think you'll meet, but they are real and three dimensional. Sin City is simply the heroic tales of three super-powered psycho-killers saving three smoking-hot dames in distress. Vigilante cowboy motif set in a modern wild west that is more sexy and less forgiving. How American is that?

B000784WMW|3.0|While the dialogue and action follows the books quite closely, I do not think that is necessarily a strength.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|An amazing adaption!  The actors are fabulous -- Ruth Wilson channels Jane directly.  She actually blushes when scenes require it, sobs realistically, and shows precisely what she is feeling and thinking.  I have watched this movie at least a dozen times in the last month and am astonished by it each time.  The last half of the movie does depart from the book, but it is faster paced and I liked it even better than the book.  (Blasphemy, I'm sure, but let me assure you that I like the book!)
0743496728|3.0|Jodi Picoult's books are hits and misses.  Nineteen minutes is among her best, yes it has it's problems and is a bit cliche at times but despite that I thought it was a pretty spot-on description of how teenagers view the world and the whole ugly issue of popularity and the untold horrors of bullying. Where the book is especially successful is it's ability to make the reader see shades of gray, the reader has sympathy at times for the mass murderer although Piccoult never lets us forget that despite his tragic past he is a cold-blooded killer.  We also have empathy for the parents in this book that despite the best of intentions, their children have slipped beyond their grasp. The book hints all along that we don't know the whole truth behind the shooting and all is revealed at the end.  Three and a half stars.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show is by far the best-made show on television.  Every episode is like its own individual film, yet they connect with definite fluidity.  The characters are very well drawn and the cast fills the characters with their own quirks.  Each episode is a roller coaster of emotions.  Sometimes you scared out of you pants and a second later your crying your eyes out.  Horrific, poignant, and even comedic, this show really delivers!

0618680004|5.0|I read the God Delusion with an open mind, as everyone should. The book, though, does a great job in arguing Dawkin's case for atheism better than any other book I have read. It is the culmination of his previous work, including the Blind Watchmaker and Devil's Champlain.<br /><br />He is effective to prove his point because he addresses all criticism and counter-arguments, from Thomas Hume to Jerry Falwell.  One way he succeeds is by taking all the cliche religious arguments and explaing how they fail. He also addresses arguments against atheism, in which people think atheism eqauls immorality.  He has a section dedicated to this and his argument is astounding and eye-opening.<br /><br />This book will raise the conscienciousness of anyone who reads it. Even if one does not agree with Dawkins, one must admire the vast amount of knowledge  he has presented in this book. Unlike most books, you actually come out smarter than going in. This will be, no doubt, the atheist bible, if you will. For atheists, this provides a defense to the religious sect and arguments to counter with.
B000LV63SQ|4.0|Not Pete's best, but still an essential album to own if you're even remotely interested in Pete Townshend or The Who. This album has two of my Top Ten Townshend Tunes, Keep Me Turning, and Heart To Hang Onto. The album would be worth it just for those two songs, but on top of that you get Misunderstood, and My Baby Gives It Away. And Street In The City is simply sublime. Get this album, you won't be disappointed.
0810994739|5.0|In his latest book, DIARY OF A WIMPY KID: RODRICK RULES, Jeff Kinney nearly put me into the hospital.  That man is going to have serious medical bills to pay if this keeps up.  I almost busted a gut laughing out loud and almost aspirated my Diet Dr Pepper on a few occasions.  And, yes, I hold him completely responsible.<br /><br />If not for Kinney's dry wit, keen insight into the lives of elementary school boys (especially their rationalization for EVERYTHING), and fantastic line drawing on nearly every page, I wouldn't have had so many close brushes with death in his latest book.  But he put me there time and time again.  Even when I thought I had things figured out (because I was once an elementary school boy with a wild imagination without a governor), Jeff would throw a wrinkle at me that I didn't see coming.  He ambushed me with regularity throughout the pages.<br /><br />But it's not just me that Jeff has his merciless sights on.  He's taking out EVERYBODY.  My wife teaches elementary school and Jeff's books are all the rage among the students.  I have to admit to adding to that bonfire because I talk about his books all the time (and I have to admit that I haven't quite become the responsible adult either, because I'll rile my wife's fourth grade class up and take my leave--taking her out to dinner usually gets me off the hook and my cool points go up with the kids).<br /><br />Parents have become interested in the books and I've told them they need to keep up with what their kids are reading.  After all, they're supposed to be responsible parents.  (I, myself, have been known to buy extra copies of Jeff's books and give out as gifts - some parents have accused me of inciting subversion, but I point out that Jeff's first book was a NEW YORK TIMES bestseller and that is a far better recommendation than I could ever make.  Except the TIMES doesn't give away Jeff's books as gifts that I know of.  That's why they hold me more accountable.)<br /><br />But when I recommend the books to parents, I issue a stern warning.  I call it the PYP warning.  I especially give it to pregnant mothers and people with weak bladders who read in public places.  PYP is Pee Your Pants.  The books are just that funny.  You're reading along, and the next thing you know, WHAM! -- you're laughing so hard you're peeing your pants.<br /><br />The funniest thing about Jeff's humor, and the life of his main character, Greg Heffley, is that everything in the book COULD BE COMPLETELY TRUE.  Speaking from experience, a lot of what's between those pages has been true.  But I'm not going to incriminate myself now when I got away with those things all those years ago.  And there should be some kind of time statute on most of them.  I still don't want my mom to know, however.<br /><br />Greg is THE man when it comes to taking a boring day and turning it upside down.  People who underestimate the creativity of a bored child are simply asking for trouble.  Nuclear war pales by comparison.<br /><br />And Greg has an excuse - or a rationalization - for everything he does.  Worse than that, half the time I get sucked in and totally buy into his point of view.  Because, upon occasion, that point of view has been mine as well (or at least my defense).  That's where Jeff's magic truly lies:  he's never lost touch with his inner child.  And boy, his wife must be mad and his kids must be terrified!<br /><br />In this second book, I was totally blown away yet again.  Greg is a middle kid, which means that his life is made miserable from both ends of the spectrum - from his older brother Rodrick and his younger brother Manny.  Rodrick is the sulky teen with a band called Loded Diper.  And their music stinks, so they're appropriately named.  Manny is three and gets into all of Greg's stuff.<br /><br />I love how Jeff sets something up in the books and continues to play off of it at appropriate times.  His sense of pacing is fantastic.  The work of \\"art\\" Manny creates outof toothpicks and aluminum foil is great, and I've seen that done, actually.  Greg's mom tells Greg he should keep it around and he does - until it impales Greg's semi-best friend Rowley.<br /><br />Another sequence in the book focuses on Greg's ringleader abilities.  Kids will follow anyone with a semi-great idea.  Or at least one that will bring pain or embarrassment to another kid.  See, Greg is NOT hero material.  At least, not yet.  He does show some potential, but it's really far into the future.<br /><br />One of those ideas involved making believe one of the other kids didn't exist.  Following Greg's lead, the rest of the class pretends the kid doesn't exist so much that Greg gets called into the principal's office, then gets read the riot act by his parents.<br /><br />I loved when Greg gets involved in the role-playing game Magic and Monsters and his mom becomes concerned.  She decides to show up and play with them.  And her rules don't involve all the violence and bloodshed all the kids are used to enjoying.  Worst of all, some of Greg's friends start liking the way his mom plays!<br /><br />Another instance is when the parents leave for a weekend trip and put Rodrick in charge.  They're no sooner gone than Rodrick is on the phone calling people over for a party.  Madness ensues.  A door gets painted with permanent marker.  Rodrick gets Greg to help him change out doors so the parents don't find out.  Later, when they're punished, Rodrick says he's going to study the effects of decompression of the spine suffered by astronauts during prolonged weightlessness.  He does this by sacking out on the couch and sleeping all the time while he's grounded.<br /><br />If you want, you can even read the books for free on the internet.  Just go to Funbrain-dot-com to read them.  One of the most interesting things about Jeff's books is that they're given away for free and STILL sold enough to make it to the top of the NEW YORKS TIMES BESTSELLER bestseller list.<br /><br />You see, Jeff wants everyone to read his books that wants to.  However, kids want books they can hold in their hands, share with friends, and put on a shelf.  Plus, it's kind of hard to take your computer and internet along when you're stuck in the car on a family trip or out with a parent at a doctor's appointment or a shopping spree.<br /><br />One of the best features about Jeff's books after you put them in your kids' hands is that you don't have to worry about batteries going dead.

B0006AAS5G|4.0|First off a few things about me. I own a Rolex Submariner and a Tag Heuer chronograph. I bought this watch because the Tag died after 10 years and I hate wearing the Rolex everyday. I own a construction company and I sometimes find myself in areas that I should not be wearing an $8500 watch in. I wanted something that was close in appearance to the Rolex but wouldn't worry about scratching. I liked what other reviewers said about this watch. And the fact that it was a Daytona knock-off was a plus.    I received this watch today, and it makes a great first impression. It has heft and weight and looks great. The packaging is fantastic. Really a first class package. However when I started setting the time and checking the operation of the chronograph, I could tell this was a cheap watch. While turning the stem it just felt cheap. Like if I got bumped while doing this the stem would break off in my hand. I also felt the detent for the date adjust was weak. It took me a few attempts pulling the stem in and out to get it to \\"engage\\" the date adjustment. I also could not get the chronograph to work properly. It would not allow Intermediate timing. And yes I read the manual, several times. That was another complaint. The manual is a generic manual applicable to ALL Invicta watches. Not a big deal, but if you're spending what they appear to be spending on packaging, how hard would it be to have a manual tailored to a specific type (chronograph) rather than every watch you make?    Regardless, I gave it 4 stars because it fit the bill for what I was looking for at a price you couldn't buy a Seiko for. Perhaps if I had spent another $100 or so and gotten the same watch with the swiss movement (this one is Japanese) I would have been even more impressed.
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Just to point out that there are a lot of reviews posted here which have nothing to do with the Queen disc, but for the Live Aid dvd.
0439882826|5.0|I gave this to my cousins' son he LOVED it!! Also his father (my cousin) LOVES it ?!? Both are big Star Wars fans. Now my uncle is asking for one for his b-day ?!?!  So I think this book is really for any true Star Wars fan ages 8 to 50 years old.
0312330537|5.0|It was at page 690 that I realized with dread that this book was going to end, and soon. I knew I could maybe stretch it out to another week at most (likely just a matter of days) and then I would have to leave Roberts' Mumbai, forever. Sure, I would be able to reminisce, wandering the same pages again and again, but there would be no new paths to discover. And as surely as I knew it would, the end did indeed finally come earlier today.    I have been to Mumbai. I have slept in Colaba, dined at Leopolds, and ridden a horse on Juhu Beach, but the Mumbai that I yearn to return to, discovering ever anew, is the Mumbai of Gregory David Roberts.      Roberts' Mumbai is a world totally engaged, deeply felt, and fully digested. It is one in which gangsters and slum dwellers vie for the soul of a man, each making his case (however indirectly) for meaning, honor, and the true nature of love, according to his own slanted world view.     And with Roberts we too get to survey the frontiers of our own virtue, as we consider the various shades of truth, innocent self-deception, and ruthless disregard for life that seduce us from behind the words, actions and beauty of Roberts' well developed world of characters.    Please write more, Mr. Roberts. Mumbai needs you to tell still more of its tale.
0802130208|1.0|For something that's supposed to be a laugh riot, I can only think of a handful of times when I thought something was the least bit funny, and none of those moments had anything to do with the terrible Ignatius. I think that Toole's main problem was making Ignatius so horrible. I couldn't have any sympathy or feeling for a grown man who screeches every time something doesn't go his way, and who treats his mother with such disdain. This is a character who has absolutely no redeemable qualities whatsoever. Even then, you could use a character like Ignatius in a way that would at least bring him some shame that he would refuse to admit, though the audience could share a laugh about him. Unfortunately, there is no point where Ignatius gets his comeuppance, and no, I didn't read the entire book, but 2/3's is certainly too much time to spend with a person like Ignatius and not have any satisfaction. You should know something about me: When I start a book, I finish it. I have never not finished a book, no matter if it takes me two hours, two days, or two years. I've read some pretty terrible books, and yet, I plow ahead, and finish the durn thing. There was nothing I could do for this book. Even with all my willpower (which is not a huge factor), the author has to give me something to latch onto, so that I can want to find out what happens in the end. The only way I could find any peace is if Ignatius had died, and I've read the final pages, that does not happen. The pace is furiously slow, the characters unimaginative, and the protagonist, a terrible human being. I think sometimes people get so wrapped up in the hype surrounding a book, the want to read it and be on the 'in' crowd who 'get' the joke. I've never been one to follow the crowd (unless I wanted to), and am not afraid to say that the emperor has no clothes.
630460291X|5.0|Despite the criticism this movie has received, it's still quite fun and memorable. Costner's portrayal of Robin Hood may not have been the classic outgoing charismatic, though he brought a charm and magnetism to the role that made up for anything lacking.
B000HWZ61Y|5.0|I love this cd!!!!  My fav. rock band of all time!!!  Rocket is my fav. that became a hit but my all time fav. is Run Riot!! Have every thing they played!!!
0920668372|5.0|This is a charming little book for young children, a tale of intergenerational love and loyalty.  It is not great literature - children's books seldom are.  It tells a story of love which never ends, a very comfortable message to children.  I like it, and our youngest granddaughter will hear it often from me.    When it is time to read great literature to her, I'll go back to Kipling.
0440241413|3.0|Confessions of a Shopaholic follows Rebecca Bloomwood who is deep in debt solely because of her shopping excesses. Her weak and naive attempts at controlling her shopaholic nature have as much success as... as doing yoga while gorging on potato chips would. The irony of all, she is a financial journalist writing for Successful Savings magazine. Sure the book is quite predictable, but that doesn't take away from the entertainment of watching her stumble through tricky situations and come out clean. Makes me wish I was a character in a book.    [[ASIN:0330375695 BRIDGET JONES' DIARY]] is a personal favorite and I found myself comparing the two, and Confessions lagged behind. However, if you want to read something in this genre, then pick it up. But be warned it is not for the weak at the wallet. All the shopping expeditions... made me feel like I just spent a bomb at a mall.
B000JJSRNY|5.0|This is total fun!    Placido Domingo can still blow most tenors out of the water!  Rolando Villazon has a sparkle and energy that reaches out and grabs   the audience.  What a voice!    Anna Netrebko's voice is even more beautiful than her amazing looks.  I guarantee you will LOVE the finale!  Traviata!  Boheme!  C h e m i s t r y!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie until the day it opened here because there was zero pre-publicity in the local newspaper. Yet, it did run a rave wire service review which whetted my curiosity since I love movie musicals. The move just stunned me and the audience because it was so brilliantly created--from cast and crew to the selection of Beatle songs. I was especially affected by the \\"Let It Be\\" sequence and everyone around me were wiping their eyes, along with myself. At the end, the audience stood and cheered and applauded. I went back to see it again and then a third time and each time I loved it even more. Although I can hardly wait to get the DVD version, there's no substitute for watching this masterpiece in a crowded theater with everyone sharing your emotions. I find it curious, too, that now that all the award shows are bestowing their \\"Best of...\\", ACROSS THE UNIVERSE, has not even been mentioned in any category--which is tragic. It should definitely have been nominated for best original screenplay, best musical, best...
B000WQW988|5.0|My husband requested this for Christmas & I was coming up empty handed looking for it in the local stores.  I was getting discouraged.  Thankfully I found it here on Amazon.  He was so happy when he unwrapped it on Christmas.  We've watched it at least 3 times now so I think it's safe to say we're happy with it.
0060194995|5.0|To think this is the only book Harper Lee has produced.  But, as they say, it's greatest to go out on top.  One word eloquently equals the sum of this book: earnest.  The book is not politically correct (nor should any book be).  Accordingly, I am sure the book outrages every type of person to whom Harper's message was written.  The book tells of the injustices black people  did, and have endured.  The time period is late 1930's.  The story line feeds the reader a view of endurance, moral right, truth, honesty, and that one must stand up for what is morally right in the face of many detractors.  Verily, a book every person should read.
B00005JPXY|5.0|There was so much hype surrounding cloverfield that I expected to walk out of the theater with a resounding 'meh'. But lo and behold, I had to think to breathe at the end of the movie. This movie really is a theater experience. This is why they make movie theaters. It was sold out at a 12am showing which hardly happens. I heard some people complaining about some shots being similar to 9/11. If that bothers you don't go. But, grow up and have a reality check. It's a monster movie. Possibly the best monster movie I've ever seen.
0679437223|5.0|Joseph Heller was a genius in delivering such a masterpiece to his fellow countrymen.  The style, and proses are evocative.  Heller keeps the plot, and storyline right above the surface of the pages.  He has you learning of one character make reference to one you will learn of later in the book, or one you just passed.  The satire is fulsome, and majestically original.  The book refreshes the reader in a way very few books can.  It is disconcerting when one realizes this is one of a kind.  Authors should take a stab at further developing Mr. Heller's gift.
B00062ZE44|5.0|First off, the music is a blend of rock and symphonic arrangements with a female vocalist.  She definitely seems to have classic operatic training, but this aspect is definitely not overdone.  This is powerful stuff, as near as I can tell they have a huge following in Europe but are much less well known in the US.  Too bad our horizons are so narrow sometimes, this group is well worth checking out.
0394517482|5.0|The author introduces the reader to crime fighting in the USSR.  In a land of subversion, and deceit, our hero is an earnest, truthful, and non malleable cop.  The book captures the nuances of Soviet, and Russian humor.  I was literally laughing out loud in the middle of a crime novel.  It was fantastic.  The characters are richly drawn, and tell the tales of living in the USSR at the height of the Cold War.  I will certainly add him amongst my must reads:  Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, Elvis Cole, and Jack Reacher.
B000002KDI|5.0|I cannot believe that anyone would care about a few notes that are missing from an otherwise great CD. The purpose of music is to entertain. If anyone can tell me they were entertained by Revolution #9 from The Beatles White Album, please write a comment. If a record company decides to make some great music more affordable with edits, this is fine with me. Does anybody realize that some of the songs on Forty Licks by The Rolling Stones were edited so they could call it Forty Licks on their Fortieth Anniversary? Does anybody care? They got all the great songs on the CD and if someone wants the unedited tracks, buy the original albums on any format that you find listenable. Vinyl is no longer state of the art.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|I don't understand why people are so against this movie.   It had everything from great special effects to a smart script.   Look its not  the writers fault that some people didn't get what was being said durng conversations.   This movie was 10 times better than the 3rd movie, and I know I sound crazy, but I would say that it's just as good as the 1st if not a little better.   Now going back to watch the first and seeing how much of a wimp Neo was in the first drives me crazy.   Take it that in the last 5 minutes of the first he could finally bet Smith looks so silly.  Especially now that he can take on hundreds at a time.   In a movies I want to see things that are impossible.   Its a shame they had to end it on such a bad movie as the 3rd one.   I only bought the 3rd to complete the series, other wise I would have skipped that one.   GET THIS MOVIE!!!!
B000002U82|5.0|Does it get any better than this? NO. This is pure genius. Pink Floyd's best. If you don't have this and I can't see why someone would not BUY IT!!! In my top ten.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|This Masterpiece production was another great example of their quality work. The soundtrack is great. Most of the actors are enjoyable to watch. This version has an edgy feel to it that I enjoyed. And finally the ending brings more closure than the previous version of Persuasion. All in all it is very enjoyable.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Beyond the (tiny) corrections and the (few) new footage included in the Final Cut, the material is amazing. The picture is sharper than a blade, with many details and nice colors. Even the 640 kb/s DD track is deep and includes lots of elements creating a surrounding experience quite impressive for 25-year-old movie.  Then, the 5-disc edition builds a \\"complete dossier\\", including all the different cuts of the film in a nice quality (if you only knew the power of preserving all cuts from the dark side...): even the workprint version, with the poorest picture, remains viewable. A large amount of bonus material is provided, including \\"Dangerous Days: The Making of Blade Runner\\" which last longer than the film itself!  All this allows to become a full \\"Blade Runner\\"-geek! Anyway, even after the release of the \\"Final Cut\\" (which bring interesting elements), the major cut changes faced by the movie are still the voice over and the ending opposing the 1982 releases to the workprint/1992-false-dir's-cut/final-cut family. Whether you want to go deeper or not, \\"Blade Runner\\" in HD is a must-have!
B000002513|5.0|This album got me through graduate school at Rutgers in the early 70's.  Ripe with rhythm, textures, and the Boss's clever way with words, I identified with the energy and the beauty ascribed to local beach life as well as the romantic portrayals of diverse East Coast urban settings.  I love this record and struggle with whether it is, in fact, his best.  I love the rough, underproduced quality of this album, unlike what we were to see two years later with the slickly produced & packaged Born to Run (which despite the glitz is an excellent piece of music as well).  Incident on 57th Street and Rosalita, not to mention Sandy, are etched in my limbic system.  This cd still gets plenty of play in my car, especially on those early spring nights with the sun roof down.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|We all know the backstory: in their ongoing quest to be unusual and innovative, Radiohead slags off EMI and informs the world their new album will be available for the pay-as-you-please rate on their website. Me, I am a bit  old-fashioned. I held out for the plastic disc, and I am glad I did. It is a sonic marvel, much like [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] or even [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail To The Thief]]. Despite the fact that \\"In Rainbows\\" was initially offered for downloads only, it certainly was not recorded with that media in mind.<br /><br />As much is apparent as soon as \\"15 Step\\" starts up. The jazzy guitar that comes in after the first verse rides above the production soundstage as more instruments begin filing in as the song builds. Have you been waiting for the days when Radiohead sounded like \\"a band\\" again? \\"In Rainbows\\" will do that for you. There are plenty of other reasons to enjoy this CD/download, like delightful ballad \\"Nude\\" or the strange innuendo laden \\"Jigsaw Falling Into Place\\" (my favorite song on the CD).<br /><br />This is probably the most non-aggressive CD Radiohead's ever made. At the same time, it's one of their most listenable from start to finish. If I had to rank it, I'd probably put [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]] and [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] ahead of it, and rank it even with [[ASIN:B000092ZYX Hail To The Thief]] and [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]]. Given a few more weeks, \\"In Rainbows\\" could grow on me even more, as I keep returning to \\"Jigsaw\\" and \\"Weird Fishes.\\"

0790729644|5.0|Clint Eastwoods last ever western is one of the best ever made. Its not a typical Eastwood western as its take on violence and the results of violence is markedly different from the many previous westerns that Eastwood has been involved in.<br /><br />Early in the film you quickly realise that this is something completly different. Eastwood's character William Munny can't even get on a horse. This scene is the first of many with a running black comedy element. Even without that element the film has other differences, such as the fact that a lot of the characters are very simple folk and as a result use simple language.<br /><br />In 1992 this film was nominated for 9 oscars and won 4 of them. Gene Hackman who plays Little Bill Daggett (the town Sheriff) deservedly won the best supporting actor role for his performance. Like most films he appeared in in the late 1980's (Mississipi Burning being perhaps his best of the late 80's) Hackman's performance is memerisingly good and as I mentioned earlier in places there are some lovely black comedy moments.<br /><br />With Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, as well as Eastwood himself, all giving excellent performances this is a film thats worth seeing over and over. Without doubt a western masterpiece and currently ranked 117 in the IMDB top 250 films.

Having had the pleasure of actually witnessing this tour live at Lollapalooza 2007, I can say with confidence that this special edition truly captures the spirit of that amazing experience.  It was worth every penny that I paid for it and then some, considering this is one RARE album.  If you can find this splendid special edition with its 50 page color photo album and bonus CD, buy it.  If you are a fan of Daft Punk, you will not be disappointed.

B000YXMMAE|3.0|There is so much filler in this album/CD, I just gotta think Radiohead could put a turd on a plate and everyone would declare, \\"Haute Cuisine\\"!.  I love Radiohead, and I like this album, but it's only average at best.  IN RAINBOWS never approaches their top releases, and to me, this one in fact ranks near the bottom - next to AMNESIAC.  Of course, I paid $85 for the fancy packaging; what the hell, I do love these guys... but let's have our eyes open on this offering.  Be honest, there are three decent tunes and a few that are comprised of the same repetative bars over and over with only subtle complexity.    Radiohead Albums:  1.  The Bends  2.  OK Computer  3.  Hail to the Thief  4.  Kid A  5.  Pablo Honey  6.  Amnesiac  7.  In Rainbows    - Still waiting for some guitars to return.

B000OVLNII|5.0|For a writer to attempt a \\"new\\" look at Lincoln is, to say the least, audacious. There can't be another American who has been more carefully studied and reported out. To actually achieve a fresh look at our most famous president and his presidency is utterly astonishing. Goodwin has created a masterwork. The author's tale includes extensive biography of Lincoln's presidential rivals, the men he then drew into his cabinet, and thereby offers a rich history that illuminates the multiple issues that wrenched this country just fourscore years after its founding. I highly recommend this book to history buffs, political junkies, writers and lovers of historical fiction. Goodwin brought me to tears in the telling of Lincoln's assassination--an amazing feat, given that the attack and outcome is known from the start.
B000YENUIQ|4.0|For most of his career, cinema maverick David Cronenberg has been content to make films on the far-off, outer margins of the commercial mainstream.  It's only natural then that he would one day feel the need to come in from the cold (at least for awhile) and get a taste of what life is like for those on the inside.  He began that effort a few years back with \\"A History of Violence,\\" a fairly straightforward movie that earned him a measure of success at the box office and a great deal of respect from both the critical establishment and his fellow directors.  Now, he continues the mainstreaming process with \\"Eastern Promises,\\" a riveting but largely conventional crime drama that serves as a showcase for a half-a-dozen or so brilliant performances.  And if the movie feels as if it is lacking in the kind of originality, passion and uniqueness of vision we`ve come to expect from Cronenberg, well, there are certainly enough compensatory virtues to make the film very much worth seeing.<br /><br />Set in London, the movie takes us into the dark, frightening underworld of the Russian mafia.  Viggo Mortensen plays Nikolai Luzhin, a recent Russian immigrant working as a chauffeur for a mob boss who uses the respectability of a high-end restaurant as a cover for his nefarious deeds.  Naomi Watts co-stars as Anna, a local midwife who stumbles upon the diary of a 14-year old girl who has just died in childbirth, a diary that could implicate the old man on charges of rape, drug-dealing and child endangerment.  This knowledge puts Anna's life and the lives of her family at risk, so the question becomes will Nikolai side with his boss or with this innocent woman who is, ever so slowly, finding her way into his heart.<br /><br />In \\"Eastern Promises,\\" Cronenberg abandons the over-the-top, absurdist elements that used to define the director's work, and settles for a more straightforward approach instead.  That is not meant to in any way denigrate the movie, for it is an intriguing tale that isn't afraid to take its time unraveling its story.  Cronenberg maintains a surprisingly low-keyed tone throughout, confident that tension can sometimes be achieved more effectively through understatement than through hyperbole.  Steve Knight's dialogue is flavorful and pungent, and he is blessed with a first-rate cast who clearly knows how to deliver the lines he`s written.  Mortensen, sporting a thick Russian accent, creates a menacing presence through his sturdy demeanor and stoic expression.

B0010X73ZG|4.0|When it comes to Stephen King, I usually come to the conclusion that you can either love him or hate him. Although, mostly, I usually hear the love for him ring in the drifty voices of those whom I've conversed with usually when I have one of his books in my hands. Now me, being one whose feet usually guides him along the more undistinguished trails, I can either take Stephen King or not. I haven't read everything by him but I have read a few pieces of his work with relish. And The Mist is the latest that I've indulged in, mostly because of the movie of the same name that was recently released. And, I do have to tell you, I was impressed with the story and compelled by the film.    Directed by Frank Darabont (whose two previous films are also helmed from works by stephen king) The Mist follows the original King story of a mysterious mist engulfing a small New England town after a freakish storm. Inside the thick mist roam various creatures bent on devouring humans and the town's survivors are trapped in the local grocery store questioning the existence of the strange mist. Among the survivors are an artist and his five year old son, the store's manager and workers, various locals and out-of-towners and a religious zealot driven insane by the phenomenon. Mr. Darabont's direction - unlike the precision he has given to his others adaptations of King's stories - gives The Mist something of a peek into the obvious thin borders of the human psyche with an almost documentary feel that lends the movie a claustrophobic atmosphere that draws one into the plot.    The performances of the cast do not seem to be flaky under the scope of usual horror-type flicks which the actors must draw upon plausible perspective in order to carry their characters through the action. Mr. Darabont has eased the characters out of his actors maybe because one never truly sees most of the monsters clearly, so the actor's reactions are more or less built on the mysterious fear of the unknown. If oneperformance must be focused on, I would have to say that Marcia Gay Harden's turn as the evil-behind-religious-propaganda Mrs. Carmody nearly chews up the screen with a performance that doesn't call for the usual campy and over-the-top mechanical methodism but rather she brings a depth to the character that is nearly chilling as one can almost tap into the prolific tones of her expression of today's political leaders acting as religious defenders which, in my personal opinion, drives me to believe that Ms. Harden probably focused on to bring fruition to her character's rise in power.    In turn, The Mist does not focus on the mosters lurking in the darkness outside but instead focuses on the real monsters inside of each person trapped in the market. Yes, the real threat is not of being mutilated by the creatures hidden in the mist but of the slow breakdown towards the primal beings inside of those who loose focus based on fear. What people will do to each other is the real horror because it usually is more severe than the physical threat of the unknown and Mr. Darabont realizes this through his sharp adaptation of the story and his whopper of an ending. Of course this type of story is not new to film, but another take on the bare and thin threads of the human condition once they are placed in extraordinary conditions. Take a look at Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece Lifeboat - which was an inspiration to Frank Darabont - to see the clear representation of man's most primitive core.    If I had a ratings system on reviewing films, The Mist would earn 4 stars overall for its story, feel, direction, performances and that hard hitting denouement. Go into the theatre expecting good entertainment, and I guarantee you will come out pondering your own hidden boundaries.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I've loved this very quiet, yet out spoken movie for at least a decade or two.  But why does another work of art have his name on it??  Did he know Raymond Briggs????  Anyone??
0517147688|5.0|I was beyond impressed with this book, with such a cheap price I didn't expect much and I am pleased to say that it is everything I hoped for a more.<br /><br />I have only seen the movies based on her books but watching them I couldn't help but feel things were left out so I simply had to purchase the book and I am glad that I did.<br /><br />This is simply....Perfect!
6305882592|4.0|Wow, I first saw this movie in my on-campus theater for fifty cents back in 1973, and laughed my rear end off... my roommate and I never forgot certain scenes.  Fast forward to 2007, when I discovered the paperback book by Colin Higgins in a used book sale.  I bought it, brought it home, and both my teenage kids read it in an afternoon and LOVED it.  I rented the movie this past fall & watched it with my daughter (my son is now at the same college where I first saw \\"Harold & Maude\\" 34 years ago, haha!)and we laughed our rear ends off once again, which led to my buying the DVD.  It's a hilarious movie, perfectly cast and I do mean PERFECTLY cast, especially the fabulous actress who plays Harold's mother.  Wow, they don't make movies like this anymore.  Even with Cat Stevens' sometimes-goofy soundtrack, the movie stands up and is still fresh, unexpected, touching without being schmaltzy, and ultimately invigorating, and that's true for me, at 52, and for my daughter at 17.  Highly recommended. By the way, I rated this five stars, but it only shows four, and I can't seem to change it.  But it's five stars.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|This was a decent movie. I like the postmodern feel of it and the rather hopeless feeling you are left with after a viewing (but then again, maybe that's just me). This movie got a lot of hype, but it is worth at least one viewing.
B000JJ4GW0|4.0|What can you say about U2? This band has been at the front of the music scene for years. If you have new to U2, this will be a great buy. If you have been \\"in\\", may want to check the playlist, as you probably have most of these tunes.     If you are looking for another band that is changing the field, as U2 did sooo many years ago, check out The Everybodyfields. They have some driving harmonies and song writing that is top notch. Listen - buy!
0061148512|5.0|I first read this book way back when, when I was a teenager. I absolutely loved it then, and it really holds up as a classic. Yes, it's a feminist novel, and yes, it's angsty, but it's also well-written, moving, and realistic. Plath was one of a kind, and the world is just a little colder without her in it.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you are a Beatles fan and don't already have a difinitive collection, here ya go. The Beatles were some of the greatest songwriters to have ever lived. If you are looking for something new, check out The Everybodyfields. They have some amazing harmonies (would remind you of some of the greats) and a old school sound.
B000RJO57I|3.0|This was pretty funny, but it doesn't stand up to Shaun of the Dead. I did like the twist at the end and the hilarious characters. If you like silly comedy, you'll enjoy this one.
B000YMBBH0|5.0|The video was great but the audio was out of sync with the video meaning the audio did not follow the persons speach there was a second delay.  I hope I can get a refund or another set sent out to replace this set.  Other than that the quality was great.
B00005JNTX|3.0|This is a pretty cool flick. Lots of action and a grizzled Bruce Willis to boot. If you like action and/or noir, you'll enjoy this one.
140120306X|4.0|This is what I expected: a daft, dark, and cynical turn on cultural icons.  Fun.
0553296981|5.0|One of the most moving depictions of a hopeful young girl I can recall. Anne Frank's diary highlights the horrors of the Holocaust through her unwavering belief in the goodness of humankind. Everyone should read this book at least once during their lifetime.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I was pretty excited about the movie not knowing to much about it in the first place. I agree with one of the written review before i, that this is not a movie for everybody.. I expected more action and killing! i do enjoy the history of it, kind of hard to understand but after an hour and half i get it.. so just keeping it short, dont expect to much like \\"gladiator\\" from this movie..
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|This was a fun movie. I like Matt Damon, too, which was a plus. The story is great and it keeps moving all the time. If you like action, you should like this film.
B000002N3N|4.0|Enya, despite being a successful recording artist, doesn't have the broad appeal as other artists; one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they're too \\"macho\\" for music that she makes. But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.    The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10    Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10    Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10    Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10    From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10    China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10    Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10    Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10    Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10    La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it's another slower paced track complete with \\"aahs\\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10    On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10    While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it's still one of her finest outings.
B000FIH4RO|1.0|For anyone who loved the first two releases from this band stay away from this one. Keyboard saturated junk is my opinion, not that I have anything against keyboards but you can barely hear the guitar. It sounds like the soundtrack to a cheesy 80's teen movie. Although considering it doesn't appear Eddie Clark had a hand in writing any of these songs not surprising. Too bad I was hoping for a lost treasure and found trash.
B000VWYNOG|5.0|I was in Ireland in Oct '07 and purchased the 2CD 37 song edition of this compilation. Try to find that one instead.
0784010501|5.0|I bought this years ago on VHS....(enough said?). It deserves a DVD release and some extras. I saw Madonna in Philly in 1989 and I loved it. I still remember the opening act...Technotronic(they sucked). The songs are still good. I didn't even know who Antonio Banderas was then.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|This may be the definitive Christmas movie and may become as iconic as Radio City Music Hall's Christmas show. It was filmed in a special process whereby human beings are morphed into cartoon like animatronic beings and the background is partly real, partly imaginary. All of this helps to create the magic and fantasy especially for kids.<br /> Will all children who doubt that Santa Claus exists, but who aren't certain of their certainty, please get on the Polar Express train to test their beliefs? Step aboard with Tom Hanks as the conductor and take a wild ride on Christmas Eve to Santa's hometown. Full of action, very scary sequences, comedy, musical numbers, and a large measure of Christmas sentimentality and bathos, the flick roars along at a fast pace, keeping the kids, and the adults who are still kids at heart, on the edges of their seats. By virtue of computer graphics we see hoards of caribou and countless elves.<br /> The movie is full of magical effects. The train runs off its tracks and goes skidding across a frozen lake with the ice cracking and chasing it. Up in Santa land on the sound track some of the Christmas standbys are sung by the old timers which make it a nostalgic treat for the oldsters watching. This movie brings back a flood of memories and regrets. If only we could go back to the time when we believed. If we could again hear those jingle bells up by the chimney (belief in Santa), how great it would be. Move over, Charles Dickens, you've got a competitor for the Christmas season.
0765318741|3.0|The first 100 pages were great, then it went down hill from there. Not that it was bad, but I was expecting a lot more. Maybe when it was written the ending would have been sufficient, but 50 years later it's kind of a let down. What was with the short stories? Is Matheson an Edgar Allen Poe fan or what his deal? It's hard to beleive that in just 170 pages a book went from a great read in the beginning to very dissapointing end. If it wasn't for the first half of the story being so good, I'd only give this 1 star, and as far as the short stories I guess they were pretty original for the time period, but they should have been in a seperate book.
B000TLTUL0|5.0|This is a brilliant and horrific movie version of Sondheim's musical play with his affecting melodies and powerful lyrics beautifully transferred to the screen. The London of the mid-nineteenth century is vividly and evocatively recreated with the lighting, cinematography, and sets. It's a musical play about love, revenge, full of villains and without heroes. It is Sondheim's fierce, dark vision of Sweeney's world in a London that seems as menacing and disturbing as the title character.<br />Johnny Depp gives a masterful portrayal of Sweeney that lets you get into his miserable soul. The New York Times music critic has commented on Depp's dramatic and musical mastery of the role with his fine enunciation, diction and perfect pitch. For Depp the acting came first, and the music added a great deal because it revealed the inner rage swirling in Todd's brain.<br />Helena Bonham Carter does a fine job playing the restaurateur who uses Sweeney's victims as the prime ingredient in her meat pies. She and Depp, ghoul-like, have black circles around their haunted eyes. They and the play are right out of the Grand Guignol tradition of the gruesome and horrible. Alan Rickman, one villain among many, portrays the lustful Judge Turpin.<br />This is a tragedy without a tragic hero because Sweeney's vengeance spreads to the killing of innocents. He sings, \\"We all deserve to die.\\" He has made the decision that man is devouring man. If he were to wreak vengeance on Judge Turpin and his beadle alone, then we might say he was justified because they had stolen his wife and daughter after unjustly having him transported to Australia for life. But he takes out his vengeance on society as a whole and becomes a sociopathic killer.<br />The repetitive blood-gushing scenes in which Todd is seen wielding his razor to cut his victims' throats are unnecessarily graphic and disturbing. They could have been done more creatively and suggestively without losing the point. We know that Sweeney is a violent mass murderer, not a tragic hero. The bloodletting trivializes death and desensitizes the viewer with the streams of arterial blood spurting out. For what purpose? Who gains from this spectacle? In John Doyle's stage version the killings were handled in a much subtler, more creative and for me more effective way. Blood spattered cloths conveyed the same message.<br />In eliminating the operatic chorus episodes from the stage play, the film has failed to present the collective response to Sweeney and his atrocities.<br />A grim but great piece of work, overly bloody, but triumphantly executed.murderer, not a tragic hero.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|The video is absolutely amazing. The videography used must have taken forever to do and it's very beautiful to watch. Almost every moment is awe-inspiring. You see lots of detail in every episode. I think this would be enjoyable even to people who aren't documentary fans. I don't know about DVD quality since I haven't seen it on DVD but the blu-ray is really great. The guy who narrates (his name escapes me at the moment) makes it interesting, clever and at times funny, not boring. I wish there was a little more information given in some episodes but maybe that's the nerd in me. =) Highly recommended to have in your movie collection!
B000E33VWW|5.0|It is remarkable that two movies about Truman Capote and both dealing with the same subtext -- the writing of \\"In Cold Blood\\" -- were made within a year of each other.  \\"Capote,\\" released in 2005, is the better-known film with Philip Seymour Hoffman justifiably winning an Oscar as best actor.  But \\"Infamous\\" (2006) is just as compelling and dare I say it, Toby Jones is just as good as Hoffman in the title role -- now that's really remarkable!  Just as important are the supporting roles in both films.  The two Harper Lees -- Catherine Keener in \\"Capote\\" and Sandra Bullock in \\"Infamous\\" -- are equally good as are the two Perry Smiths -- Clifton Collins, Jr. in the former and Daniel Craig in the latter film (can this really be the same actor as the super elegant James Bond in the latest Bond film, \\"Casino Royale\\"?). Clearly, being the second film released, \\"Infamous\\" was generally overlooked despite an all-star cast which included Jeff Daniels, SigourneyWeaver, Isabella Rossellini, Peter Bogdanovich, and Gwyneth Paltrow (in a small cameo role).  On the other hand, \\"Capote\\" has the always superb Chris Cooper in a critical supporting role.    If you are a fan of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" it is facinating to see Harper Lee as portrayed in these two films and reflect on how Dill could grow up to be Capote.  In conclusion I can only suggest that you see both films, they both deserve it!    After seeing one or both films I would hope that you would read (or reread) \\"In Cold Blood\\" or see the 1967 film adaptation (with the star remaking turn by Robert Blake as Perry) or do both.  No matter what you think about capital punishment, you will rethink your views after reading or seeing these works of art.    An aside: the only other example I can think of where an Academy Award-winning actor had a contemporary play the same character in different movies is Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" and Brian Cox in \\"Manhunter\\" based on Thomas Harris' novel \\"Red Dragon.\\"  Again as good as Hopkins is as Hannibal-the-cannibal (#1 in the AFI's list of greatest movie villains), Cox is just as good in \\"Manhunter.\\"
0143038419|1.0|E. G.'s novel \\"Stern Men\\" is one of my all-time favourite books, so I had high expectations for Eat Pray Love. I also enjoyed \\"Pilgrims\\" very much. This book was disappointing. Granted it's an autobiography/memoir; but as I read I found myself becoming so irritated with Gilbert's self-absorption that I quit half-way through. Maybe I'm cynical, but the fact that she already had a big advance and contract for the book under her belt before undertaking this so-called quest to find some meaning and balance in her life makes me wonder how authentic the characters and experiences really are. Someone told me, \\"it's a very inspirational story.\\"  It only inspired me never to read anything other than fiction by Elizabeth Gilbert.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|Ok, it's not perfect, but what the hey.  The sets and costumes are beautiful, definitely, 5 stars for location shooting(Thanks BBC!), the main actors are good (the father is great), and all and all, love lost-love found reigns again in the heart of us true romantics.  My main complaint is it's too short, and the climax is a little crazy, but you have to love the shots of Bath's 'Crescent'.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|This is one of the movies you must have.<br />Full of adrenaline and inspirational. I never get tired of watch it.

078322947X|5.0|I first saw \\"Sorcerer\\" when 14, and I thought it was terrible.  In my 40s, I see it differently as a mirror on reality and as a great movie.    Whatever your current problems, they aren't as bad as those of the principal characters in this movie.  They are four men who are refugees from greater society (a terrorist, a man wanted for high-stakes financial malfeasance, a petty criminal wanted by the Mob, and a professional assassin).  They all flee to a nasty South American back water town, and then the sabotage of an industrial facility 200 miles distant causes an oil well fire.  Dynamite to put out the fire is located near the back water town, but it is very old and copiously leaching nitroglycerine.  It has to be driven the 200 miles over truly bad third-world mountain-and-jungle roads, and the only available vehicles are a scrap heap of ancient trucks.  The company asks for volunteers, and the four get selected.  They cobble together two working trucks, and then the road trip begins.    What's great about the movie is watching how the men react to the enormous stress placed on them by the task they've accepted and how it tears them apart.  They are beset by truly awful conditions (old and rotten rope-and-wood bridges, giant trees across the road, endless rain, crumbling mountainside roads, bandits, etc.) that take an enormous toll on the participants.  It ends with the Roy Scheider character, clearly insane, hand-carrying the dynamite to the fire fighters.  There is no happy ending here for anyone.    This was the movie William Freidkin made after \\"The Exorcist.\\"  Called, \\"The toughest, most relentless film in a long time\\" by a contemporary Newsweek review, it lives up to that and more.  The score by synthesizer band Tangerine Dream helps propel the story along.    It is a great adventure movie.

B00000099Y|5.0|One of the best albums to come out of the '90s, &#34;Aenima&#34; is without question Tool's best album to date by far. In all seriousness, words just can't even begin to describe how brilliantly genuine and amazing this album truly is. For a band that has been called everything from metal, to nu metal, to alternative and progressive rock/metal like another reviewer said, Tool does such an incredible job at exhibiting the attributes to all of these aformentioned genres to create a kind of music that's adventurous, timeless, transcendent, deep, dark, mysterious, forbidding, and intrigiuing all in one geniunely amazing package. This album here is a 77 minute monument of pure dark, brooding, and brilliant musical genius that takes the listener on a dark and disturbing journey through the mysterious depths of the human mind. This is definitely some of the best music I've ever heard. The lyrics on this album can really make you think as well as feel, and the band's songwriting and musicianship is just effectively top notch all the way through. If there is one word to describe vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and that would be amazing. This guy is without a doubt one of the greatest singers in all of rock music whose powerful vocals can go from peacefully melodic and soft one minute to just explosively angry and fierce the next. The guitar playing courtesy of Adam Jones on here is also amazing as well as Justin Chancellor's sick, pulsating, melodic bass work, and of course the phenomenal and intricate drumming from Danny Carey really adds the beat and pulse, setting the pace for the dark and mysterious musical journey that is on this album.<br /><br />The album's classic opener &#34;Stinkfist&#34; is one of my favorite cuts that begins with some bouncy, atmospheric guitar notes which soon leads right into a powerful hard rock song anchored by hard driving guitars from Adam Jones, pulsating, melodic bass lines from Justin Chancellor, and hard hitting drum work from Danny Carey, which are all topped off by Maynard James Keenan's amazing vocals, and he also belts out some really fierce, and explosive screams during the song's chorus. The following song &#34;Eulogy&#34; is another brilliant song that features an awesome intro that includes some really weird yet catchy, beeping guitar sounds and atmospheric bass riffs, and some soft percussions, and then Keenan comes in singing in a distorted kind of tone before the song finally hits full force with his clear singing voice along with the booming guitars and thundering drums all coming right in just like a powerful punch to the gut thus turning the song into an explosive rocker from there. Track three &#34;H&#34; is another one of my favorites here, and is also a dark, melodic guitar-driven song that is highlighted by amazing riffing throughout, along with great percussion work from Carey including some nice tribal-like rhythms, plus there's also another amazing vocal performance from Keenan as well.  Then we have the 40 second interlude track &#34;Useful Idiot&#34; which features the sound of the needle skipping at the end of a gramophone record growing louder as it segues right into the heavily bass-driven track &#34;Forty Six & 2&#34; which is another one of Tool's best known songs. This song is highlighted by Chancellor's addictive bass intro along with Jones' powerful guitar charges, Carey's awesome drum work, and of course Keenan's amazingly powerful vocal deliveries throughout, and I also love the pounding riffs at the end of the song which are just like thunder to my ears. The following interlude track &#34;Message to Harry Manback&#34; features the sound of calming new-age piano music and the background noises of seagulls while a message from an answering machine is playing, while &#34;Hooker With a Penis&#34; is a blistering, powerful hard-rocker that is loaded with brutal, charging guitars, powerful drumming, and ferociously intense vocals from Keenan throughout. Another thing that I like to point out is that the song's title refers to a fan who accused Tool of selling out after the success of their single &#34;Sober&#34; off of their 1993 album &#34;Undertow&#34;.<br /><br />The album's third interlude cut &#34;Intermission&#34; features a really weird yet cool circus-like organ sound, and then it takes us into the following track &#34;Jimmy&#34; which is dominated by Chancellor's amazingly melodic bass lines, along with Carey's fantastic drumming, Jones' stunning guitar grooves, and of course the hypnotic vocals from Keenan as well, while the following track &#34;Die Eier Von Satan&#34; is an industrial-like track that features some heavily distorted bass line that gives way to a heavy industrial guitar riff at the 23 second mark that lasts only ten seconds, playing a single note in Drop C tuning over a reversed drum beat in compound triple meter, and the lyrical component of the song is spoken in German by Marko Fox. The album's next song &#34;Push-t&#34; is another phenomenal number that is highlighted by more of Jones' outstanding guitar work including a nice, fuzzy intro riff that almost sounds like the sound of bees buzzing or whatnot, along with Keenan's mesmerizing vocals, Chancellor's wonderful atmospheric bass hooks, and Carey's fantastic drum work throughout.<br /><br />Afterwards, we have &#34;Cesaro Summability&#34; which is yet another interlude track that features the sound of an infant crying over a background of distorted guitars that lead right into &#34;Aenima&#34; which is undoubtedly the album's best song and is also my favorite song by Tool as well. This song is an absolute hard-rocking tour de force of killer guitar grooves, pulsating, melodic bass lines, tight, powerful drumming, amazing vocals, and apocalyptic lyrics, the whole nine yards. The song is also highlighted by an amazingly poweful slide guitar solo from Jones at the 3:38 mark as well. In general the song is a diatribe against celebrity culture, particularly around Los Angeles which includes everything from the Church of Scientology to possibly rappers (&#34;gun-toting hip gangster wannabes&#34;), to drug addicts, Hollywood executives and actresses whom Maynard views as scum and wishes would all be flushed down the proverbial toilet. Next up, we have &#34;(-) Ions&#34; which features some atmospheric sounds and the sound of electrical sparks which build up and lead into the album's 13+ minute epic finale &#34;Third Eye&#34; which starts off with an audio sample of the late comedian Bill Hicks talking about how he believes that drugs have done some good things for our society, and saying that the best rock albums were all made on drugs, and afterwards the song builds and continues to build more momentum throughout with a dosage of powerful guitars, pulsating bass lines, fantastic drums, all lead by Keenan's always amazing vocals.<br /><br />All in all, &#34;Aenima&#34; is a monumental masterpiece that is truly without question one of the best and most important albums of the 90's, and is also Tool's crowning achievement, and a true testament to the band's musical genius as well.

B000TYWAUA|5.0|This is about one of the few greatest movie adaptation's of a comic book out there. If you put aside the history and look at the fact that this movie was made from a comic book you will understand the story better. Also keep in mind all of the other comic book related movies recently made have been real stinkers. Best comic book adaptation into a film made. Plain and simple.
B000002AGN|5.0|This is, as most other reviewers have already mentioned, a classic. It represents a brilliant fusion of jazz, blues and northern european classical music, while also exploring numerous difficult time signatures. Released in 1959, this album was certainly cutting edge in terms of its ambitious aspirations. It still sounds fresh. Dave Brubeck's classical training shines through, while Paul Desmond's sweet saxophone tone complements Dave's playing brilliantly. This album was a jumping off point, and the quartet's time experiments continued over the next handful of years, with \\"Time Further Out\\", \\"Time Changes\\", \\"Countdown: Time In Outer Space\\", and \\"Time In\\", all of which are also exceptional albums. A fantastic album that serves as a great starting point for those experiencing Brubeck, or jazz for that matter, for the first time.
B000YIGNKE|3.0|Yes, I loved the book, tied with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as my favorite Austen, and I tried not to be disappointed by this production. But the truth is, that in Austen's hands, the characters of Anne and Captain Wentworth generated more heat by themselves, much less together, than this production can muster with all the collective brilliance of the BBC's creative team.     And I say that with all due respect.    The bad reviews of this DVD seem to stem from the usual, predictable disappointment people feel when their beloved book becomes physically and spiritually shrinkwrapped, so to speak, to fit into the format of a contemporary two-hour TV piece and DVD.    That said, I remember feeling \\"lit from within\\" when I first read this stirring classic. I related strongly to Anne, developed a mental snapshot of her that I've carried fondly all these years. Sally Hawkins, it should be said, is a wonderful actress, and probably a worthy Anne, except not what I or many others pictured from the book.     Ditto actor Rupert Penry-Jones, who also boasts a distinguished resume (his marriage to the estimable Irish actress Dervla Kirwan not the least among his accomplishments), yet as Captain Wentworth his demeanor and deportment sag, rendering both first, and more sadly, last impressions of his character hopelessly milquetoast.    Titillated by the passion with which reviewers here recommend the Root-Hinds version, I look forward to enjoying it.    In all sincerity, nice try, Masterpiece Theatre. You did a somewhat better, more satisfying (but too postcard pretty) job with Jane Eyre. Though that production felt not quite dark enough in its atmospherics, lead actors Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens somehow managed, nonetheless, to pull off the heat and pulse we Eyre-ites all yearned to feel.
B000N6TX22|4.0|a great movie in its own.  i would say this movie is one of the few that have actually stood out to me in recent memory.  it was packed with excitement, suspense, and hey it even had a good story to back it up.  the only complaint i have is that the ending was kind of a cliffhanger. it seems like the movie could have been an additional 10 more minutes to actually conclude but the director kind of assumes you know what will happen. other than that the movie was great.  acting was great, the special effects were great, and i would even like to see a directors cut with an additional ending to it.
B00005NTNM|2.0|Fans of Clint Eastwood's original \\"Dirty Harry\\" will find little to cheer about in this uninspired sequel. Despite good performances by Eastwood and co-star Tyne Daly, \\"The Enforcer\\" (1976) suffers from a poorly developed script and James Fargo's lackluster direction. The action highlights are rather sparse, with surprisingly few Clint one-liners to enliven the proceedings. Jerry Fielding's jazz-oriented score is a weak substitute for the pulsating rhythms of composer Lalo Schifrin. A definite low point in the Inspector Callahan series.
1400049628|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It had me in stitches from cover to cover.  Great bathroom book.  I mean that in a good way.  Recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor.
0151013047|2.0|The book description and positive reviews does lure you to read this book. I spent just under 2 hours to finish reading the book -- That tells you that it is a fast read, well-paced and intriguing.     The book is told as a first-person narrative, quite unique. Changez, the story-teller and the protagonist, is in conversation with a unknown American stranger. There is not much background setting for why this conversation started or the context within which it all began, but in the big scheme of things, it is not that important.    In the following 184 pages, Changez goes on to narrate his executive, Wall Streetesque professional life in the US, his doomed relationship with a mentally unstable American, Erica, and his identity crisis as a young twenty-two year old from Pakistan. After all the personal conflict he narrated, I expected him to turn into something sinister, but  the climactic ending that I eagerly anticipated, turned out to be sorely disappointing.     Perhaps the intention of the author was good, perhaps he wanted to engage, enlighten, and educate an American audience about the perceived animosity of Muslims from the east, and on misguided American foreign policies that have led to many troubles in Asia, and elsewhere.    While the intent was there, the execution was lamentable. The irrelevant romance was a huge distraction. I could not emotionally relate to the character. Usually, I find that characters set in the tapestries of pretentious upper class New York societies, seem disconnected with what an average Pakistani or Indian Muslim truly faces in America. If he had changed the setting, some of the rage, confusion, and nostalgia of a Pakistani in a post-911 paranoid America, would be relatable.     Regardless of how the characters were woven, he failed in his main objective of educating and enlightening an audience about the nature of religious conflict and the angst against American policies. Reza Aslan's book \\"No God but God\\" is perhaps a more worthwhile read about that, or the many articles by the eloquent and objective Fareed Zakaria of Newsweek, or even recent fiction such as, Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns.     Further, his analysis of the Pakistan-India, so called 'nuclear' conflict was exaggerated and not explored in detail. Perhaps the author wanted his character to be flawed, to be intoxicated by what he saw, but not by what was happening, or what was true.     In the end, I thought, it was an efficiently crafted rant, poetically camouflaged, but losing sight of its original purpose. To address such a complex issue, it sometimes pays to write a lengthier novel, Khalid Hosseini comes to mind.
0812974611|5.0|I bought four copies of this book.  In addition to its being a colorful thriller, set in an interesting time, I should mention that I was just about to climb Vesuvius when I first read the novel and that I come from a family of geologists, hydrologists, and mining engineers.  There, now you are alerted to my bias! I especially had fun imagining various men of my family as the protagonist.  Heroes with backgrounds in the earth sciences are a rare breed because engineers tend to be too circumpect to get themselves into any sort of dangerous excitement. Of course, when one finds oneself involved in a volcanic explosion, being circumspect is no shield and one must use one's brains and experience to find a creative escape. (Brawn and bravado are not alone sufficient, but moral fortitude can define a different sort of heroism. (Think Bilbo Baggins.) I really liked this aspect of the novel. Creativity and seasoned intelligence are traits sadly missing from the heroes of most thrillers.    I liked the writing well enough to go back and purchase Imperium (also by Harris) which gives a very different look at the life and career of Cicero.  It, too, is an exciting discovery for anyone with an interest in the dirty side of politics.  It requires a special talent to bring to life legal wrassling, social climbing and political events that occurred millenia ago.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|I love Michael Buble. Love him. But I can't listen to this album.  The arrangements are good, the song choices are good, but he lisps throughout it and it drives me nuts.  I don't hear him doing this on any other album, so what gives? Just a bad day in the studio I guess. Try something else, he is good otherwise.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|This is a great collection of songs, thank you for releasing it. I especially like The Game of Love with Michelle Branch, great chemistry!
B00005KHEU|4.0|I agree it's not the best ELO albums, but I would rate it among the best four. The dynimism of 'Shine a Little Love' and 'On the Run', the catchiness of 'Confusion' and 'Don't Bring me Down', great orchestations of 'Last Train to London' and 'Wishin'' and the romantic sweetness of 'Need her Love' and 'Midnight Blue' form the happiest and brightest of the superband's works. It's a time of change in the music world, and the flavour of this album makes it the most related to its time of the band's ones, probably along with the weaker 'Balance of Power'. The declive that would come afterwards would only be in commercial terms, as 'Time' and 'Secret Messages' would be at least as great artistically as this one. A great album for refreshing and enjoying with quality and dynamic genuine music. The band Jamiroquai owes its existance basically to this album.

0141439831|5.0|William Makepeace Thackeray (1811-1863) was born in Calcutta, educated in England and died on Christmas Eve 1863. Along the way he was an illustrator, lecturer, journalist, editor and most notably a great novelist. During his lifetime Mr. Thackeray's works ran second only to the immortal Boz Charles Dickens in popularity and copies sold. His masterpiece is \\"Vanity Fair.\\"<br />  The title is taken from Puritan John Bunyan's \\"Pilgrims Progress\\".Thackeray used it to as the ttle of his 800 page behemoth of a Victorian three-decker. Vanity Fair examines with irony, wit and realism life in Napoleonic Europe. The vast panoramic work has countless character but the main ones are:<br />1. Becky Sharp-one of the greatest bad girls in all of fiction who inspired Margaret Mitchell's Scarlet O'Hara in Gone With the Wind. Becky is the daughter of an impecunious painter and a French show girl. Her father dies and Becky must be sharp in intellect to survive. Becky is a shrewd baggage of lies, deceptions and intrigue who also is charming, talented in music and art.She beguiles the reader.  Becky leaves Miss Pinkerton's Academy by tossing out the coach window Dr Johnson's dictionary symbolizing her earthy awareness of life as it is lived. She is a rebel and lives today as she did in 1848 when Thackeray created her.<br />2. Amelia Sedley will remind you of Melanie in GWTW. Her father loses his fortune and she marries the playboy idiot George Osborne. George is killed at Waterloo so Amelia is forced to raise their son Georgy in poverty. Amelia is an innocent ninny who lacks intelligence though her motherly love is commendable. The reader wants to smack her for her refusal to have sense enough to know that William Dobbin is madly in love with her!<br />She has a stupid brother Jos Sedley who becomes the love slave of Becky. He spends years in India and grows wealthy, fat and dumb.<br />3. George Osborne weds Amelia but at the Duchess of Richmond's Ball in Brussels on the eve of Waterloo he writes a love note to Becky. George is spoiled by his rich family. He is egotistical and greedy.<br />4. William Dobbin is the best friend of George and is in love with Amelia. He is a faithful and loving friend who is always there to help Amelia when she is in in a jam. Life a faithful old horse who might be named Dobbin he is a man with a good heart and mind. His love for a married woman is based on Thackeray's own infatuation with a married woman Jane Brookfield.<br />5. Rawdon Crawley is a British officer who is the son of the old rogue Sir Pitt Crawley of Queen's Crawley estate. He loves gambling, girls, drink and Becky Sharp. Becky will have a stormy marriage which will founder on her affair with Lord Steyne. Rawdon's borther is Pitt Crawley Jr. who inherits the estate and weds a good woman named Jane Sheepshanks.<br />  Thackeray's work will hold your attention despite its great length. His account of the civilian experience of the battle of Waterloo is superb. Thackeray has humor, pathos, sadness and joy within these pages. To fully enjoy Vanity Fair you need to read it rather than watch it on a DVD! Victorian novels are often long due to the fact they were published serially in magazines.note to Becky.

B001152TL6|5.0|Lost Highway is my favorite Lynch film and one of the ten best films ever made (not just in my opinion, but empirically).  I have been waiting so long for it to finally be released on widescreen DVD that I actually went insane and created an alternate reality in my mind in which it was.  I hope this review and my pre-order are happening for real and not just in my head.  But then again what do I care?  I'm watching it on blu-ray right now.  And yesterday I'll probably have been watching it on my 3D VR holographic crystal player as Ruggero Deodato.
0812975219|1.0|i am still trying to understand what was the book about...need i say more?    i am very sorry i have spend the money to buy it but i am handling it with stoicism...just like it is described in the book!!!!
0393061310|5.0|Another book I wish I hadn't waited so long to read.  The thesis, well-known at this point, is that it is not inherent biological or \\"racial\\" differences that account for variations in success during certain points in history, but rather the geography and climate peoples started out in.  The better the conditions, the earlier the development of food production, which then leads to a population growth and more \\"developed\\" government institutions and innovations such as writing and military technology.  The darker part of the thesis is that early exposure to animals leads to both the evolution of hybridized animal-human diseases (chicken pox, the bubonic plague, smallpox, etc.) and immunity to them.  As Diamond notes, this is the deadliest weapon \\"civilizations\\" have in their arsenal against peoples not as far along on the food production/complex government path, as shown by the conquests of both the indigenous peoples of the Americas and Australia.<br /><br />Although Diamond is careful not to pass judgment or pull at heartstrings (which may be warranted in many instances), he does note that the pivotal moment in the long race for development was the extinction of many of the large mammals in Australia and the Americas.  Had those animals survived and been domesticatable, the fate of the Americas in particular might have gone the other way.  However, Eurasia was the continent with the most geogrpahic advantages, the most significant being the east-west axis, which goes hand in hand with similar latitudes throughout the continent.  Similar latitudes, in turn, make it easier to pass crops from one end of the continent to another.  That Africa and the Americas are dominated by a north-south latitude means that it is difficult to pass crops froms one end of the continents to the other.<br /><br />Towards the end, Diamond is careful to point out that while geography gives a head start, it is not a guarantee, and political considerations must be taken into account when trying to determine which country- or even business- will win.  Throughout the book, Diamond mentions in several places that although the Americas and other regions hadn't achieved certain milestones by the time they met with the Eurasians, that didn't mean that they weren't going to if left alone.  He also notes that in the indigenous cultures he's worked closely with, he's met some brilliant inventors.<br /><br />I thought the thesis was inherently not racist, and I'm not getting- at all- some reviewers complaints about that.  In fact, at the beginning, Diamond points out reasons why the average member of the indigenous population of New Guinea is arguably more inherently intelligent than the average member of a given Western civilization: because New Guineans have a longer history of hunter-gathering, the primary killer among them is murder.  Evading such a death requires more intelligence than evading death by infectious disease, which is more likely to fell a Westerner.  Also, because hunting and gathering for food requires more skill and knowledge than going to a supermarket for food, survival doubly demands intelligence.  Finally, most New Guineans lack the distractions Americans, Europeans and many upwardly mobile Asian countries have (television, internet, etc.) which have been shown to impede intellectual development, particularly in young children.  Diamond makes that point not to prove the intellectual superiority of a certain country or \\"race\\", but to show that ultimately, it doesn't matter; no one would argue that the New Guinean legacy has been more successful through the world than the Eurasian.<br /><br />I thought this was one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read and I can't wait to read more from Diamond.  I also thought this was written clearly enough for most people to understand and even enjoy- I found myself laughing at a few parts, although my humor may admittedly be a little bit drier than others.  Regardless, this was an engrossing read that helps reframe thoughts on \\"progress\\" and \\"civilization.\\"houghts on \\"progress\\" and \\"civilization.\\"
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|Not reviewing the movie (which I give 5 stars) only the quality of the Blu-ray disc version. As a number of people have already stated the quality is not very good. It is slightly better than regular DVD but seriously needs to be remastered and re-released. There is tons of graininess, just look at a paused screen. Most close-up scenes had a better quality but still nowhere near other high definition movies. Some people incorrectly assume that older movies will be of a lower quality simply due to age but that is not accurate. There are plenty of old films that are fantastic in HD such as The Warriors (1979), 2001 (1968 - though filmed in 70mm), and even Casablanca (1942). All these films are amazing in HD. What makes the biggest difference is how well stored and cared for the masters are. But even still with today's technologies a lot can be done to improve a less than stellar master. I suspect someday they will remaster and re-release this movie just like they did with The Fifth Element which looked no better than DVD originally but now looks phenomenal in the remastered version.    So, don't expect this movie to be reborn on Blu-ray cause it simply isn't. It is however better than DVD and the deleted scenes, as bad as they were, were interesting to watch. I don't recall ever having seen this film with surround sound and it was a great experience in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound.
B00122O34O|4.0|We loved the movie Juno and hence this music reminds us of that great experience. It is a cute album; the songs are simple but fun. Our children like it too and it is appropriate for young people.     However, this isn't an album that is going to get much better with listening. There are simple melodies with mostly nonsense lyrics that are fun on the very first listen. Two songs, \\"Well Respected Man\\" and \\"All of the Dudes\\" don't fit very well since they are \\"professional\\" while the rest of the songs are very \\"indy\\".    I don't want to be too negative about this; I'd certainly buy it again. Just don't expect too much.
1401307787|5.0|This book is a classic. I often give it to friends who are struggling or are just looking for a new way to live more freely.  I also give them FREE YOUR MIND by Sensei Anthony Stultz. His book makes all of Kabat-Zinn's ideas more clear and in a how-to fashion that is really pragmatic. I highly recommend them both (I read Free Your Mind while in the UK where it is a bestseller).
B000051Y0G|5.0|Carole King,Whitney Houston,Sheryl Crow,Paula Abdul,Mariah Carey and Alanis Morrissette all have had Grammy-winning debut albums. Guess what? New York native Cyndi Lauper has had one also,this one. In fact,she qualifies for induction into the Rock And Roll Hall Of fame this year since this album was released in late 1983. With Lauper's two-hue haircolor(yellow and strawberry red),you can plainly see why SHE'S SO UNUSUAL. Top 20 hits from this album include GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FUN,TIME AFTER TIME,ALL THROUGH THE NIGHT,SHE BOP and MONEY CHANGES EVERYTHING. There's also a cover of Prince's self-penned WHEN YOU WERE MINE. Lauper's second release in 1986,TRUE COLORS,was a commercial success,but no Grammy winner. Secondarily,Lauper became an actress,starring in the 1988 Columbia flick VIBES and co-starring with Michael J. Fox in 1993's LIFE WITH MIKEY. Satirist-parodist \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic recycled GJWHF for GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE LUNCH,released in 1985 on his DARE TO BE STUPID album. Surprisingly,Lauper re-recorded TAT in 2005. ATTN is a popular favorite amongst adult contemporary radio stations. SB and MCE really rock! The other songs are great,including the two-minute(estimate) title track which was written back in 1930,according to the copyright information. Lauper even was a teen idol back in 1984 and '85,when she was then in her early thirties. This was indeed one of the top-selling albums of 1984. Other top-selling albums of '84 include Van Halen's 1984,Huey Lewis & The News' SPORTS,Prince's PURPLE RAIN soundtrack album and Tina Turner's PRIVATE DANCER.
B000TGCR38|5.0|Another one of those terrific movies that won't get to the Oscars.  Run and see it if you haven't already.  It's WW II drama that's exciting, entertaining, yet pleases the intellect as well.
0143142356|5.0|I did not read the first book but \\"World Without End\\" truly stands on its own. I listened to the AudioBook CD and it was wonderful. I borrowed it from the library and when I got to the end I realized that was just Part 1! I frantically got myself to the library to borrow Part 2. I couldn't go one day without it. I'm sorry I finished. Beautifully written, engaging characters, surprisingly sexy! What more could you possibly want from a novel. Bravo!!!
B000TEMRIU|5.0|With the album download price of less than 9 dollars, this is an amazing buy with the amount of content you are getting.
0143034901|5.0|Stayed up nights to get through it. Other reviews and the editorial reviews have given the synopsis, so I won't need to go into that. The characters may be many, but stay with it. It is well worth it, it has you baracking for some characters, yet boo-hooing others. Great read!
0316067598|5.0|I have heard Petty Officer Luttrell a number of times on the radio and each time, the host winds up having to have him on a second day, his story is so fantastic. Fantastic in that Luttrell even survived his ordeal in the mountains of Afghanistan, alone, his 4-man team pitted against 150 Taliban and he, the lone survivor.  I have added this book to my \\"25 Greatest Gifts for Your Soldier in the Gulf\\" list. By hearing Luttrell's story, other soldiers will live through him and put themselves in his shoes. By reliving his circumstances, they will pre-form their own decisions, such whether to spare the lives of civilians who happen across your patrol or whether to execute them to spare your own men's lives. That is the purpose of writing; to share your knowledge, wisdom and story so your reader hopefully will learn from them. And, in this case, make it possible for them to live another day.
6305907145|1.0|Why one star?  I didn't know how to leave it empty.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  I wonder that this even qualified for the use of the title.  Yes it has the plot and the characters' names, but that's about it.  The character development, especially of Fanny is terrible. We don't even know what qualities in Fanny lend her to so \\"good\\" as we do in the book and the BBC version, nor would this character even qualify for those qualities.  The characters are, unfortunately current \\"Hollywood\\" style.<br /><br />And where was the warning...brief upper nudity scene, I hardly think this was in Jane Austen's style.  Leave Mansfield in it's time era, don't try to update it to this time...it just doesn't do.<br /><br />I was so disappointed I actually got rid of the DVD.  It's naughty and not at all a Jane Austen.

B000WQW988|5.0|I had listened to Nirvana's most well known tracks back in the early 90s, and I knew of the circumstances surrounding Kurt's death. But - since I had not taken serious notice of Kurt and Nirvana early on, I didn't fully realize why some people on the radio were so vocally mournful of his passing.<br /><br />Then in late 2006, my then 13 year-old son got me reinterested in grunge music and Nirvana at a deeper level. We were stuck in slow car ride during a snowstorm with only a Nirvana CD in the car. I listened to several tracks I hadn't heard before, either because I was a tuned out baby-boomer and/or they didn't receive the airplay. Following up, I listened to a lot more and it was a musical reawakening.<br /><br />I later bought the unplugged DVD as an early holiday present for my son, and it ended up being a present for both of us. I actually kept it after our first watching - and viewed it late at night while I was doing some laptop work. In summary - watching this video makes you wish Kurt could be resurrected. This is a truly great live performance! It's like being in the living room with a relaxed, yet well-rehearsed and enormously creative artist.<br /><br />Biggest pluses - the unplugged version of \\"All Apologies\\" is even better than the already great studio version. Great collaboration with the Meat Puppets - especially \\"Lake of Fire.\\" Kurt's take on Leadbelly's \\"Where Did you Sleep Last Night\\" is riveting. There was a good measure of low-key but effective humor and side comments.<br /><br />This performance was humble yet visually interesting to watch. They did not need to \\"put on a show\\" to move their audience. To Nirvana's credit, this performance was actually the antithesis of stagemanship. And that is because the stagemanship was not necessary.<br /><br />My only regret is that they didn't include an unplugged version of \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" in this collection. For that, you need to pick up the \\"Wishkah\\" CD (or download the MP3). The Wishkah is a river near Kurt's native Aberdeen WA. This information I gained from a recent film \\"About a Son,\\" which is an exceptionally well-done retospective documentary.<br /><br />I agree with Tom Petty in regard to a comment he made about Nirvana being \\"the most significant band since the Beatles.\\" Kurt Cobain was a truly amazing talent - and it ended far too soon.information I gained from a recent film \\"About a Son,\\" which is an exceptionally well-done retospective documentary.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|Not many movies make me laugh; not many things make me laugh, but this one did. It was wonderfully and outrageously silly. It's been quite a while since I last saw it, and it still gives me a good feeling. I bought it for a friend, because she seemed to be enjoying it, while we were drifting through Myer-Emco. It still leaves me with a good feeling, and I think I am going to borrow it from her sometime.
B000026OW3|5.0|There is no need to comment on the fame and ability of Artur Rubinstein. It is well known that he is the best interpreter of Chopin. My only concern when buying this CD set was the quality of sound. Most of the recordings were made from the 1940's to the 1960's, so I did not expect much in terms of sound quality. However, I was greatly surprised when I heard these CDs. Tough the sound is not quite like a state of the art recording, it is very good. Only if you turn up the volume to a very high level you would hear a low hiss. Other than that, the recording is excelent. I really recommend it. The performances are excellent and the price is good for an 11 CD set.
B000W4HJ44|4.0|Ok, I'll probably be hated for saying that the HAIRSPRAY movie deserves 3-stars, while the dvd set gets 5, but that's my opinion.<br /><br />HAIRSPRAY(TWO DISC SHAKE & SHIMMY EDITION)dvd set is the way two disc dvd sets should be. Loaded with extra's like behind-the-scenes and full-length featurettes following the evolution of \\"Hairspray,\\" from John Waters crossover success movie-to-Broadway-to-musical motion picture of today, that should make any fan of this movie happy. So the dvd set earns the 5-star rating.<br /><br />The movie, however, is a different story. I know that there are people who either love this version of \\"Hairspray\\" and hate the other or vice versa, and I happen to fall into that camp. I don't hate this version, there are moments that I enjoyed like the \\"You can't stop the beat\\" number, it's just hard to take over the original.<br /><br />Nikki Blonsky did a fine job as \\"Tracy Turnblad,\\" but she didn't have that spark that Rikki Lake had.<br /><br />I love John Travolta, but he really should have passed on this one. He doesn't come close to Divine's performance from the original movie and it's painfully obvious. Though it's not fair to compare, how can you not? Divine played the role of Edna Turnblad as a middle-aged house wife who let her looks go to hell. Travolta played the role like an aging drag queen. Where Divine was a woman through and through--deep voice and all--Travolta was more of a caricature of a woman...clasping his hands constantly and taking teeny-tiny-dainty steps...he looked ridiculous.<br /><br />Just because you put on a wig, a dress, and some makeup does not a woman make! I only bring it up because Travolta was saying on one of the featurettes that he didn't want any part of his \\"manliness\\" to show, which is why he's in a padded body suit and has prosthetics from his face to the tops of his feet. But his performance just screams \\"man in a dress!\\" And you would think that with all the gay men working behind the scenes someone could've told him, \\"Look, you're either a woman or you aren't.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, the stand out performances in this version of HAIRSPRAY: James Marsden as \\"Corny Collins,\\" Michelle Pfeiffer as \\"Velma Von Tussle,\\" and Christopher Walken as \\"Wilbur Turnblad.\\"<br /><br />So if enjoyed the original movie of \\"Hairspray\\" and you haven't seen this version yet, rent it first. If I did, I probably wouldn't have purchased this set. You might like it, but it's nothing like the original.<br /><br />I give an average score of 4-stars to be fair.r a woman or you aren't.\\"    Anyway, the stand out performances in this version of HAIRSPRAY: James Marsden as \\"Corny Collins,\\" Michelle Pfeiffer as \\"Velma Von Tussle,\\" and Christopher Walken as \\"Wilbur Turnblad.\\"    So if enjoyed the original movie of \\"Hairspray\\" and you haven't seen this version yet, rent it first.

B000HIVOI2|5.0|I own the extended version DVD and it doesn't hold a candle to Blu Ray! Of course, you need a blu ray player and a HDTV capable of displaying 1080P. You see so much more detail and gain a greater appreciation for the movie. I am definitely a Blu Ray Fan ! Experience the difference for yourself with this movie or maybe the Fifth Element. It really is like seeing the movie for the first time. Treat yourself.
B00005O5UK|5.0|OK, this edition has the same content that the 1997 version edited in the U.S. (the original album + a live recording + the interview + the complete printed \\"St. Cleve Chronicle\\"), only in a miniaturised form that reproduces the original 1972 vinyl release.    For those of us hard-headed Tull fans who were born too late to enjoy the original vinyl album (I was born one year later, in 1973), this japanese release gives us an adequate approach to that marvelously surreal and innovative design.    Regarding the music, I don't think I could add any more than what has been said or written, Thick as a Brick is a legend among the rock scene and the album that showed the world what a concept album was (or was not) supposed to be, to say the least.
140120306X|5.0|In common with the previous volumes of LOEG, Moore and O'Neill have come back with a strong interpretation of a ficitonal world based on fictional characters co-existing in the same era, a Wold Newton-type technique.<br /><br />This time the era is the 1950s, a post-Big Brother totalitarian UK that reminded me of Moore's V for Vendetta and resonates with a modern war-on-terror Britain and US.<br />I don't think its an accident that this story brings back Moore's criticism of authoritarian regimes seen in The Watchmen and V for Vendetta.<br /><br />The book moves away from between a standard graphic novel format and writings in the style of authors from PG Woodhouse to Jack Kerouac and even a Tijuana Bible (an eight-page blue comic that was popular in 40s and 50s America) and a 3D comic.<br /><br />Part of the fun is trying to work out the literary and popular culture references as Moore mixes the well-known with the obscure to cook up a heady story. James Bond changes from blond beef-cake Daniel Craig, to the ruthless psychopath that Fleming originally intended. In Moore's story Bond's character has an additional dimension: treason.
B000089A07|5.0|Red Dragon was awesome. After the ok \\"Hannibal\\" and the lousy \\"Hannibal Rising\\", \\"Red Dragon\\" is technically the 2nd story in the line of the Hannibal Lector series. It's more of a psychological thriller with a little bit of horror where \\"Hannibal\\" was more horror and killings than anything else. Nothing will ever come close to \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\", but \\"Red Dragon\\" does as the 2nd best. It's the story of how Hannibal Lector is arrested and thrown in the dungeon prison to begin with. So we do see him living life in the beginning, however he's courted by a detective played by Edward Norton who captures him. The Edward Norton character eventually needs Hannibal Lector's services to help him catch a serial killer that is at large who calls himself the \\"Red Dragon\\". This is suspenseful and extremely good. Highly recommend.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|\\"Shriek!\\"<br /><br />But who doesn't love `Shrek'?  I mean I guess it has it's detractors but come on people, if ever there was an animated feature perfectly designed to entertain EVERYONE `Shrek' is that movie.  It's funny, fresh, entertaining and exciting.  In fact just about every scene is memorable and every character brilliantly crafted.  Kids love `Shrek', there is no denying that, but adults have plenty to adore as well.<br /><br />The story behind `Shrek' is that of Shrek, a grumpy, lonely Ogre.  When Lord Farquaad banishes all the fairytale creatures to the forest Shrek finds that his secluded swamp is now more crowded than ever.  In a selfish attempt to gain sole custody of his land he agrees to rescue a certain Princess from her captivity for Lord Farquaad.  Accompanying Shrek on this journey is Donkey, a talking donkey who forms an unhealthy attachment to the miserable Ogre.  Princess Fiona is being held captive by a dragon in a tower far, far away awaiting her true love to come rescue her, breaking her dreaded curse with love's first kiss.  Shrek was not what she had in mind, but upon her rescue and journey back home is becomes apparent that Shrek and Fiona may be kindred spirits after all.<br /><br />The plot behind `Shrek' is not the most original, I'll give you that, but its execution is as original as it comes.  `Shrek' plays out more like a spoof on every Disney cartoon out there (kind of like this year's masterful `Enchanted'); in fact a lot of former Disney characters appear in this film (and its two sequels).  `Shrek' has a lot of fun poking fun at the very characters and stories that inspired it and this leads to plenty of laughs.<br /><br />Helping to create some extremely memorable characters is the cast of vocal talents.  Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz tackle the lead roles of Shrek and Fiona and do so splendidly.  Mike Myers has proven time and time again that voice work is his forte; I mean what would any of his `Austin Powers' characters be without their signature accents.  John Lithgow is hilarious as the devious Lord Farquaad.  He adds spunk and humor to every line.  Of course everyone talks of Eddie Murphy's brilliant voice work as Donkey (why is Eddie not in every cartoon?) and rightfully so.  With quick wit and Murphy's signature attitude he creates the perfect companion, the perfect sidekick equipped with an amalgam of memorable and quotable catchphrases (\\"We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!\\").  One can't go without mentioning the expansive cast of supporting players though, because it's within the supporting players that we find many of our laughs.  Voice work done by Bobby Block, Chris Miller, Cody Cameron, Christopher Knights, Simon J. Smith & Conrad Vernon just to name a few deliver such memorable characters as Pinocchio, The Three Pigs, The Blind Mice and of course The Gingerbread Man (who's whole `Muffin Man' routine is my FAVORITE scene in the film).<br /><br />Beautifully animated and magically brought to life `Shrek' is the animated film of this generation, a cartoon that paved the way for bigger and better animated spectacles.  It started here and so rightfully so it deserves our praise and admiration.  There is rarely a treat this sweet so dig in and enjoy every last minute of it.John Lithgow is hilarious as the devious Lord Farquaad.  He adds spunk and humor to every line.

B000UFAURI|5.0|Dave Grohl's ability to turn out rock authenticity and acoustic gems like \\"Let it Die\\" really never ceases to amaze. The influences (e.g. Led Zeppelin IV) are there, but in his hands become something new, the genuine excitement that comes from an author an enthusiast. The singer-songwriter has always been inside of Grohl's rock persona and he bridges these two worlds so well.  I like the risk of the solo piano \\"Home\\". You really feel that he can just keep it coming--there's more left to write.

0375424474|5.0|This is the most enjoyable book I've read on evolution since Gould's fine Wonderful Life.  Shubin not only combines great skills in paleontology and anatomy with an insatiable curiosity, but he also has a rare gift at writing as well.  The book looks at aspects of human anatomy and senses--hands, smell, hearing, vision, etc--and traces them back--way back!  Some of this, of course, has been done before, but Shubin writes with a flair, a clarity, and a precision that brings it all into a new focus.  There is also an emphasis on DNA, in particular recent DNA experiments that combined with the paleontology and anatomy makes a very compelling case.    Shubin starts off with the search for a link between fish and land animals that took him to the Canadian Arctic and culminated in the discovery of Tiktaalik--a fish with a flattened head and flippers that made it look rather like a very primitive alligator in ways.  The author then shows the evolution of necks and limbs. He does the same with some of the organs such as smell and vision, and shows their evolution as well.    The book is perhaps at its best in its discussion of the role of DNA in evolution.  It is now known that it is possible to turn on a gene that is responsible for the development of an eye, for example.  So you can create a fruitfly with an eye almost anywhere you want--such as on a leg--and many of these are functional, although in a primitive way.  But it gets even more interesting.  Suppose you take a gene from a mouse that controls the development of an eye, and implant it into a fruitfly, what happens? You get a fruitfly eye, not a mouse eye.  This says a lot about the basic building blocks of life.    The book does have one major flaw.  At 200 pages it's way too short!  If the writing were dry or stiff, 200 pages would be sufficient, but with Shubin's thoroughly enjoyable writing and choice of subjects, I would have preferred 600 pages.
0767817478|2.0|When I was thirteen I saw `Godzilla' three times in the theater.  Then, when it was released on video I watched it another four or five times before completely forgetting it existed.  Then a few nights ago my wife and I caught this little ditty on cable and all these boyish memories of watching this overly large reptile lay siege to New York rushed back to my head and I was genuinely excited to watch this `monster' movie yet again.  About twenty minutes into the movie and I realized that there is a huge difference between what entertains a thirteen year old boy and what entertains a twenty-three year old man.<br /><br />A big difference.<br /><br />As far as special effects and computer generated explosions are concerned `Godzilla' delivers the goods, but if you're looking for a logical and absorbing plot that proves to be as interesting as it is entertaining then your S.O.L. here.  When reflecting back on the mishap that is `Godzilla' I also took some time to watch Peter Jackson's remake of a similar `monster' movie `King Kong' and noticed right off bat the difference, major difference at that, between the two.  Jackson attempted to create a well rounded movie, Emmerich attempted to make one long action sequence.  In that regard Emmerich succeeded, but I prefer a film with a little more meat attached to its bones.<br /><br />So `Godzilla' introduces us to the Polynesian born monster that mutated from Iguanas exposed to French nuclear tests as he surfaces in Manhattan in search for fish.  We are also introduced to a wannabe News Journalist and a scientist helping the government and some strange French guy as they all interact in pursuit of the creature.  We are supposed to care about the former relationship between Dr. Niko Tatopoulos and Audrey Timmonds and rally behind them as they reenter their relationship; but we don't.  No, fact remains that the only character we care about here is Godzilla himself, a gigantic reptile who scours the city sewer system and tramples building after building with lighting speed and catlike agility.  Quite frankly, that's all that matters.  Yes, if you watch this movie with nothing more in mind them mindless CGI fun then you will be entertained, but if you are wanting a smart and logical adventure then you will be sorely disappointed.<br /><br />Like I mentioned in the outset; there is a big difference in what constitutes entertainment to a child and an adult, but while I prefer to watch something meaningful and though provoking there is still something to be found within `Godzilla' worth finding.  With `Jurassic Park' like effects and `Independence Day' like destruction `Godzilla' is a worthy action film that will at least offer an ample amount of excitement for the audience.  It's not a `good' film, but if you're not expecting too much then `Godzilla' will deliver just what you may need at the moment; some mindless fun.lding with lighting speed and catlike agility.

B000YXMMAE|5.0|An interesting shift for a seminal band--more melodic, less dark, more song structure, while keeping the signature sound.

It gave us a good opportunity to talk about Sharpay's negative personality traits with our girls (ages 7 & 9). They understand that this is not a good way to act.  But, if Disney puts out a HSM 3, I will preview it before I let them watch it.

B0002DRDBE|5.0|It's sort of hard to describe this movie.  Put it this way.  I didn't know what in the world I was looking at when I caught Clerks mid-way through in the fall of 1996.  I was in Navy specialty school in Meridian, MS when somebody rents this movie in the enlisted club and I became a fan for life.  All I remember is a guy in the movie singing into a fake mike, \\"Berzerker, my love for you is ticking clock Berzerker!\\"  These people in the movie looked like people I went to school with.  When I found out the movie takes place in New Jersey, I immediately felt right at home.  I am from Jersey and I am telling you that this is like no movie I have ever seen before.  It is unique unto itself with random discussions about Jedi, milk maids, fornication and other wacky characters making their appearances, you will not regret buying this flick that will live on in infamy.

B00005N6KG|4.0|These Sony gems are my ideal day-to-day headphones: inexpensive, ultra-portable, over-the-head style (I hate the 'modern' Star-Wars behind the neck style and earbuds are loathsome), delivering good quality sound with decent volume in noisy (subway) environments. They are extremely low-profile; when walking around the city with them on, people who approach me to ask for directions or money often can't tell that I'm wearing them. The headband is durable, flexible, and can be adjusted for a snug, comfortable fit. When not in use, the 'phones roll up and can be stuffed into a jeans pocket. Because the speakers fit into your ears, outside noise is largely eliminated, however they don't muffle the outside world so much as to be dangerous (obscuring traffic noises, the cries of rampaging maniacs etc.). The sound quality is not the highest, but these are 'street' headphones after all, for when one is on the move, and for that purpose they sound great. Finally, they are cheap, and this is a good thing, because they absolutely will wear out (minus 1 star for that). It seems wrong to praise a product that is all but guaranteed to break, but these heaphones are so well-designed in every other way, so perfectly suited to traveling between destinations when on foot, that their disposable nature can be forgiven. I get mine at Target.

B000I2JKFG|5.0|*I'm sure you can read the basic story line from the product description so I won't rehash the specific events of the movie for you again.*  I was quite disappointed to read one of the editorial reviews describing this movie as \\"stylish but empty\\".  I found this movie to be one of the most thought provoking and emotionally appealing movies made in the last decade. The connections between the characters (Evy, V, Valarie-the girl in the cell next door) are complex and at times heartbreaking.  The movie has an underlying political message that is very relevant today- not just another county's future where the movie is set.  We must be wary of blind faith in our political leaders; fear should not allow us to give away our personal freedom and rights as human beings.  We are not just a number(5 i.e. V) or a sexual preference, creed, etc., we are human beings and we all have our own story to tell.  This is a movie not only about the transformation of a government because of terrorism but how it can change people.  If you are reading this and trying to decide whether or not see this movie I would highly recommend it (although I have not read the graphic novel which I'm sure is better-all books are better than their movie counterparts).  I've lent it to a few of my friends, all of which enjoyed it.  Whether you love it or hate it- V is a must see movie.

B000BYA5GO|5.0|The basic plot of the movie is that our hero (not) Yuri Orlov rises from an impoverished immigrant childhood to be a colossus of international gun-running.  He provides everything from AK-47s to tanks to grenades, and he provides them to anyone with the money to pay.      I admire the creators of this picture for having the guts to openly discuss what is clearly a horrible and insane business.  Nicholas Cage as Yuri is weirdly detached from the implications of his \\"job\\",and Jared Leto as his high-strung and drug-addled younger brother is wonderful as a pained voice of conscience.  If I had a brother like this, I think I would become a nun with Mother Theresa's Missionaries of Charity or something, in a desperate bid to balance out the family karma.    The violence of Yuri's world is no-nonsense, and not for the faint of heart.  This movie really made me think.

B00004KD1A|5.0|To say I was glad the day I saw this gem remastered,with additional tracks on cd is the understatement of a lifetime.I consider myself lucky to have seen this master play live(I believe he opened for Triumph back in the early 80's,blew them off the stage).The entire set list is great,my favorite tracks being Wayward Child & Follow Me,incredible!The fact that they added Bad Penny and Key Chain only makes the cd that much better.A great remastering sound,heavier than I remember the album being,probably due to me playing my album so much.The only thing better than this would be a DVD of it! This is what Les Paul had in mind when he invented the friggin' guitar!!! Thank You Rory,R.I.P.
0805079831|4.0|I was a little misguided when I purchased the book, I thought I was getting a book detailing the history of economic shocks and their results.  To my surprise (and my lack of attention as I purchased the book) the author had a different agenda.    As someone with an extensive economic policy background I found the research excellent, however the conclusions were based more on an ideology rather than the results of research.  I do not say this as a criticism of the author or book as it makes the story much more compelling and gives the reader a very rich experience.    If you are a free-market enthusiast, be prepared to have your concept of globalization challenged.  If you lean more socialist in your political beliefs, you will probably find comfort in this book supporting your cause.    My editorial comment with respect to the book, which has really sparked interesting conversation, is that there are inefficiencies in all market theories when a certain variable is introduced...humans.    I recommend the book and hope you enjoy.
032147404X|5.0|This book is interesting and very useful for specially amature. Most of the techniques are practical.
0143038419|4.0|I loved this book.    I've read several other books since I finished this one, but I clearly recall one of my favorite parts, where Liz was riding in the car with her friend and getting her \\"petition signed\\" by God and everyone who cared about her. It was so sad, and funny, and real, all at the same time. The book moved me from tears to laughter many times, often within the same paragraph.     Sharing the journey through the three \\"I\\"s and  learning about the people Liz meets along the way made me feel like I was there too. The time she spent in each place made me envious. I wished I had a passport, a year off and a paid writing gig!     I was grateful to be able to share in her experiences and watch her personal transformation.
B00005JPTI|3.0|This is a good Will Smith movie, but as the latest adaptation of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it disappoints. Some effort goes into the psychological aspect and survival strategy, but not deep enough to create the philosophical MacGyver that Robert Neville should be. Blame this partly on the casting. Smith is wrong for the role: he's not believable as a Colonel or a top scientist, or ultimately a father figure. Denzel Washington or even Nicolas Cage would have been far better Robert Nevilles. Another problem Will Smith brings is his fan base includes very young kids. As I sat in the theater, an entire group of third graders trouped in to watch the movie. They weren't actively disruptive, but they laughed at the wrong things. However, they bought tickets and made the Movie Moguls happy. Personally, I would find sitting through Shrek long enough to learn the lines, a hell worse than being eaten by the zombie-things, but I'm sure it delighted the young-uns. One aspect I may have shared with the kids was I thought, no holds barred, the dog is the best part of the movie. So much, that I would have given anything if when the other survivor-lady shows up and admires the picture of his daughter (with dog) and she comments on how pretty she is and who is she, couldn't Will have responded, \\"oh that's Samantha!\\" I mean, he's been bonding with the dog for years now. It would have seemed appropriate.  I was really looking forward to this pic since I'm a fan of it's other two incarnations, and I admit it was good, but not as good as it could have been if you're familiar with the story. It's disappointing they have yet to make a really good adaptation of this great idea.

B00005JKG9|5.0|...in which Kevin Spacey wrings more meaning out of the words \\"Will you go to lunch!\\" then one would think possible. The modern day Death of A Salesman, and after this, no-one will mourn his passing. A Chicago office of seedy real-estate salesmen hustling worthless Florida swampland to the  weak-minded is the unlikely milieu for this hilarious indictment of the American Dream of \\"Get Rich Quick.\\" The front office has handed down a mandate of \\"Always be closing,\\" with the salesmen's jobs on the line if they don't make their quota. [The title-quote of my review is how this threat, called a \\"sales contest,\\" is presented to our heroes.] The sweaty anxiety this induces in these low-rent con-men gives rise to retaliation, when one of them robs the office.     David Mamet's adaptation of his own Broadway hit (remember when there were actually good plays on Broadway, rather than endless musical adaptations of movies that sucked the first time around?)opens out the work, and adds two crucial scenes, including the infamous, brilliant, obscenity-and-abuse spraying Alec Baldwin \\"sales contest\\" monologue as a means of making the nest of vipers that populate the story more desparate, and hence more sympathetic.    But there are two things that makes this film essential viewing, if you can handle dialog that is perhaps 65% unrepeatable in this forum: a dream cast, firing on all cylinders, with several actors who too often fall into schtick giving the performances of their lives, including: Kevin Spacey as the officious office manager; Alec Baldwin as the vicious emmisary from the unseen bosses, come to crack the whip; Jack Lemmon as an ageing Willy Loman former superstar salesman who's losing his grip; Alan Arkin and Ed Harris as a Mutt-and-Jeff Laurel & Hardy duo, one a schlemiel and the other a bundle of rage and comic exasperation; and best of all, Al Pacino, using his often-questionable over-the-top mannerisms of recent years to great effect, as the master hustler, Ricky Roma.The scene where he strikes up a casual conversation in a bar with ordinary Joe Jonathan Pryce and spins a web of boozy ruminations around his unsuspecting prey until it becomes a full-blown sales pitch is a 10 minute master class in acting and writing, a true tour de force. The amazing thing about Mamet's masterpiece is that every scene is of the same quality, street language singing like operatic arias which build to gratifying climax.    The other reason to see Glengarry is the script-- there are more classic zingers than any movie in recent memory: Alec Baldwin: \\"What's my name?$%#@ you, that's my name!\\" Allen Arkin: \\"Are we speaking here, or are we just talking?\\" Al Pacino: \\"Vishnu himself could come down from the heavens...\\" And Jonathan Pryce's easily overlooked patsy Mr Lingk, seemingly incapable of getting out an articulate sentence in the face of Ricky Roma's sales pitch/verbal onslaught.     The late great Lowell George of Little Feat fame once said his lyric-writing aspiration was \\"eloquent profanity.\\" Mamet achieves this in spades here, and what a cast to put it over. Filmed theater at its best, screen acting pyrotechics to die for, and dialog so sharp it cuts like an electric knife. For cynicism and black humor, it's only match is Sweet Smell of Success.
0452286751|3.0|This is the first Ayn Rand that I have read.  I was exhausted by Dominque in that she could have been happy if she had allowed herself to be.  All of the other characters were miserable..except for Roark, the brilliant artist who lived his life objectively.  I appreciate Rand's lesson about being objective which she taught very well in Roark's character.  I found Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand's lives rather boring.  All in all I enjoyed this but the Toohey nonsense about getting drunk with his drama junkies could have cut out about 100 pages that wasted valuable time.

B000YIGNKE|1.0|I belong to the school of thought that proclaims \\"A bad Austen is better than no Austen\\" but friends, this is the most appalling film adaptation of ANY Austen novel. It is as though the people responsible for this disaster were DESPERATE to distance themselves from the perfection that is the 1995 film with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root.  To achieve this lofty goal, they set out to hire ALL the wrong people: Screenwriter, Director, Actors and Photographers. The result--the Anti-Austen, or rather, Austen Lite--a film reduced to a melodrama that surely has the author spinning in her grave. All the opportunities that make this a most wonderful book were cast aside. The result: A spiritless, emotionless and humorless film--and a colossal waste of an evening. What a shame!
B0002DB52M|2.0|I thought this was an interesting presentation of a pretty interesting concept. But the movie is fatally flawed. It is just plain boring and not compelling at all. Nicole Kidman is a very good actress but the movie has a weird vibe to it that just doesn't really ring true. I felt like I was watching somebodys vision of what and how people act but the persons view just seems like bunk and unreal.
B0007KTAU4|5.0|I once read an article by a music critic who wrote, that she had used this album numerous times as a gift, as she had experienced that carla bruni's music was popular with very different people. I couldn't agree more. Whenever I play this album people ask about it, and whenever I give to someone, they return and say that they love it. The music is soft and Bruni's voice is warm and present. The french lyrics make you fell a little like sitting in a cosy french cafe with a croissant and a hot cup of coffee :)
6305364648|4.0|I thought this movie was really fun, smart and funny. Arnold is at his best. Tom Arnold is funny as hell as his sidekick and Jamie Lee Curtis is funny and hot. I enjoyed this movie a lot. Some of Arnolds meat head co-actors in the action genre could take a lesson from the king meat head. He knows how to actually be funny. This is something that Stallone can never pull off. I would recommend this movie to anybody it is really good.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|As everybody else already said - this is a must for anybody interested in this planet. You might see the episodes on Discovery channel in HD too and even record them on TiVO, but... And if you think about it: new species are not appearing but many we have now are vanishing, so if you think that a better DVD set will be able to capture even what this one did - I seriously doubt it... Sad, I know.  Get these  (even the normal DVDs should be great) and you'll have something to pass to your children too  :o)  Seriously - it's EXCEPTIONAL !

B000001GRE|5.0|Boulez is great in this symphony - by playing the \\"fast\\" movements slowly and the \\"slow\\" movements quickly, he portrays a musical joke.  Not Boulez's joke on Mahler, but rather Mahler's joke on us.  By playing over-the-top sentimental music in a completely unsentimental manner it makes a mockery of sentimentality.  Mahler is too smart and too self aware to resist the opportunity to parody himself and his own echt-romantic tendencies.  The result is this symphony, as performed by Boulez.  In my opinion it's quite brilliant.
B000MXPE88|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much. Everything about it was good. There is only one flaw that was very distracting to me. Everybody in the movie ages... everybody but Matt Damon. He looks exactly the same as an aging CIA man as he did when he was a young homoerotic Skull and Bones pledge. Other than that I thought the movie was great. Oh, and casting John Boy Walton as Damons son was kind of bad too. The guy wasn't bad but he was the A-typical 'weakling son of the strong dad' role.
B000QXDED6|4.0|Oh yeah. I watch this movie not for any artistic merit or the story or whatever. I watched it for the Beefcake factor. Oh yeah, we may be a violent species, as one eloquent reviewer put it, we are also a sexual one. For me, watching 300 was pure selfish sexual gratification.    Oh my God.... In an age where we are brainwashed into thinking out of shape women can parade in public in bikinis and men, even specimens like David Beckham, has to be covered up in veils, this movie is a breath of fresh air. Finally, we get to see what makes men men. Endless shots of hunky half naked men in nothing but capes and black leather briefs.    Hope there will be a sequel: 301!
B0000640S2|1.0|I literally almost lost my life watching this movie when it first came out. My friend went to see it and told me it was so funny that we had to go. The theater was jam packed and we had to sit in the front rowe. I was eating popcorn and we were both laughing so hard at how dumb and ridiculous that it was that I sucked a piece of popcorn down my throat. And when they tell you that when you are choking you can't make a sound... they are right! I managed to lean foward, stick my finger down my throat and dislodge the meddlesome piece of puffed corn.<br /><br />Now... that is how stupid this movie is. It is SOOOOOOOOOO STUPID it almost killed me. Now that is STUPID.

B000F9RB9Y|3.0|This is a true classic of the sci fi genre. a five star movie classic,  That being said Warner Brothers made no attempt to clean up the print for the blu ray release.  This was a early release from the studio on the new format. They since have released many flicks with excellent cleaned up pictures. However sony also made this mistake with their release of  the fifth element and then recalled the first edition and put out a proper cleaned up release.  Warner brothers needs to do the same with this one.  Lets just hope that no other movies get released on blu ray with tear and wear lines down the center of the picture. 'caligula' has them too sadly but that's a special case,  Blu ray should never have such poorly done transfers on this format. Even the newer release of this is just the same print. this is lame.  Someone clean this movie up! they fixed 'predator' so why can't they do the same for this and 'robocop\\"?
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This movie is great.  Nonstop action from the start.  Just as good, if not better than the others.
0312323867|5.0|Emily Giffin wrote this book as an continuation of \\"Something Borrowed\\". Although it is a ´continuation´, the world is seen through the eyes of the \\"enemy\\". I almost forgot the two books were written by the same author, since it narrates the world of two people totally different. The lesson is simple: a \\"thruth\\" can be a lie when it is seen through different eyes!
B000XA5K48|2.0|Some movies you just can't seem to understand why you bother watching them. There are just certain movies that are kind of like train wrecks, you know that the outcome will no doubt be disastrous, yet you can't help but watch as the movie reaches its inevitable conclusion. It's these types of films that have earned the title 'Guilty Pleasures', because no matter how hard you try there's just no explaining why you're watching the film, because there isn't much of anything to merit your attention, but there you sit, like a goober, watching a movie that you know will end up being a waste of time. A recent example of this is the 2007 brainless, action movie \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" starring Clive Owen (\\"King Arthur\\"), Monica Bellucci (\\"The Matrix Reloaded\\"), and Paul Giamatti (\\"Cinderella Man\\").    \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is about a man named Smith (Clive Owen) who, out of sheer coincidence, happens to be in the right place at the right time as a man is attempting to kill a pregnant woman just before she is about to give birth. Smith follows the man, proceeding to intervene before the murder takes place, after dispatching the killer and assisting the woman in childbirth, Smith finds himself in yet another fight between the would be killer's former cohorts, led by a man named Hertz (Paul Giamatti). After escaping from the fight, Smith finds himself the surrogate father to the newborn baby after the mother is caught in the crossfire. Now, Smith is on the run with a baby in tow from a maniacal mad man, and his only assistance is a prostitute (Monica Bellucci) with the proverbial heart of gold.    Writer/director Michael Davis has managed to take a bunch of over-the-top, overblown action sequences strung them together with one of the weakest storylines I've seen in a feature film (even some of Steven Seagal's Direct-to-DVD films have better plots), assembled a fairly strong cast (each of whom should really have known better than to do this movie, but you know the saying, \\"Money talks.\\"), andsomehow convinced New Line Cinema that this was a viable property worthy of theatrical release. Kudos for the effort Mr. Davis, I don't know how you did it but the fact that this movie ever made it to theaters is beyond me, this movie's script had DVD bargain bin written all over it! I will give \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" and its writer/director Michael Davis this, the action sequences may be over-the-top in every sense, but they are mostly a lot of fun to watch, although by the end of the movie I found myself tired of the endless barrage of gunfire that had permeated almost every scene in the film. If nothing else, these stylistic, fast-paced gun battles is probably what kept my attention in this film, because it sure wasn't the story which wasn't made clear until approximately 15 to 20 minutes from the end of the film.    For an action movie to succeed with audiences it must of course contain plenty of high octane, energetic action sequences to keep the adrenaline junkies going, but it must also have some semblance of a storyline tying the fight scenes together to give the movie some sense of purpose otherwise we're just watching a bunch of meaningless fights that don't have any point behind them and that gets boring really quickly. But, when a movie's story isn't made clear to the audience until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie, then I think the writer has made a horrible mistake and is lucky the audience has made it with them this far into the film. In the case of \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" writer/director Michael Davis was fortunate that he had crafted such creative and fun gunfights to keep my attention, plus the fact that I like the cast helped him out quite a bit, because without those key components I would have ditched this movie long before the basic plot was revealed and would have felt that I hadn't missed much of anything. A little advice for Michael Davis, if you intend to keep the audience on board with you for this kind of movie, it would probably be a smart ideato give a little bit more of the story away throughout the entire duration of the film, not just waiting for the end to explain everything like its some massive secret that would change the entire movie experience.    The cast that was assembled for this film, led by Clive Owen, Monica Bellucci, and Paul Giamatti, were of a much higher caliber than I would have expected in such an inferior piece of so-called \\"entertainment\\". Even though the story was lacking in almost every way, the actors managed to do a decent job of creating characters the audience could become interested in, even if their story arcs were essentially non-existent. I must say Paul Giamatti was actually a surprise as the villain in the film, I never thought that he could handle playing the main villain in such a movie, but the over-the-top performance he gave as Hertz fit right in with the rest of the movie's tone, and was actually one of the best things about the entire film.    If nothing else can be said for \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\", it at least lives up to its name, this film is essentially nothing but one gun battle after another and before long all the style and quick camera cuts in the world can't help these scenes from looking the same and leaving the audience bored. I believe that even die hard action fans that love to see nothing but non-stop action will be hard pressed to actually enjoy this movie all that much, because by the time the movie is almost over you'll probably find yourself hating the constant barrage of gunfights and wishing for a little drama to fill up some time.    \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|The \\"Final Cut\\" represents the end of the longest post-production in movie history-twenty-five years. This is how the film should have been released back in 1982. However, A lack of time and money kept it from being finished. Also, the film's backers added a horrible voice-over and a ridiculous happy ending, and they deleted the unicorn scene. The fans are responsible for this film finally being completed. There were enough of them to make it profitable for the owners of the film to put-up the money to bring director Ridley Scott back to apply the final polish to his masterwork. This is a real improvement over the so-called \\"Director's Cut\\"-technical mistakes have been corrected, dialogue has been added and or changed and additional editing has tightened the film. The print, sound and music have also been up-dated. Overall, we now have a smoothed-out narrative and this is the shortest of all the many versions of the movie. This is now a perfect film! When \\"Blade Runner\\" first came out as a butchered and unfinished movie, it was generally dismissed. The release of the improved ( the voice-over and stupid happy ending were removed and the unicorn scene was added), but still rough \\"Director's Cut\\" led to a favorable critical re-appraisal and eventually placed the film among the 100 greatest films of all time. Its reputation will soar to even greater heights with \\"The Final Cut.\\" Look for \\"Blade Runner\\" to move-up on the list of the greatest films of all time.

0895260131|5.0|Having read the Koran and a fair amount of world history, I already knew much of what was said in this book. As far as I can tell, the author isn't making anything up. If Islam or any other religion/ideology is worthwhile, then it should be able to stand up to criticism.    I would recommend it.
0743486285|5.0|There were parts of this book that were really painful to read because they were so bleak, but it was overall a very powerful book. Only criticism I would have is that while some of the current commentary interspersed with the diary entries is really interesting, he could have left out the comments from the girlfriend Vanity. In her current incarnation as an evangelist, she's so liquored up on religion she sounds like she's crazy. He's a really lucky guy to have survived everything that he did.

It has two of my favorites songs, Love Letters and Cry me a River. I fell in love with this CD and it is all I listen to now....Diana Krall is so warm and sultry and makes you feel every touch of the piano. I can't wait for the next wonders of Diana. Thanks Diana for a great and awesome CD. A little history on the song Love Letters, it is from the movie of the same name from 1945 starring Joseph Cotton and Jennifer Jones (great movie). The song and movie were both nominated for an Academy Award. The song was written by Victor Young and lyrics by Edward Heyman. I love the ending notes of this song, it is just beautiful.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|Sunshine starts out strong, but fizzles out in the second hour.     An international team of astronauts is on a flight path that will pass close by the sun. Their mission: To deliver a bomb to reignite the sun's core. Yeah the premise is a little flimsy, but what do you want? Its science fiction for chrisake. Visually, the first hour was stunning - especially in high definition. The cinematography, the combinations of color and light, paired with an understated, trippy soundtrack - everything came together beautifully. In contemporary scifi movies, it always seems as though improvements in special effects are offset by a deterioration in the quality of the acting. But in this movie, the actors all did a great job. No one character dominates the dialogue or camera time quite so much as Captain Kirk. Amazingly, all the characters seem as if they could be REAL PEOPLE. The movie really flows... at least for the first hour.    Spoiler alert - The crew detects a spacecraft that was lost 7 years ago, and modifies its flightpath to rendezvous with the lost vessel. Some crazy guy has survived aboard the lost vessel for the last 7 years, time which he spent \\"speaking with God\\". In short order, this guy starts killing people and sabotaging the mission's objective. Why? Is he motivated by some cosmic revelation achieved after years of isolation in space? Frankly, I didn't care. The crazy guy was an infuriating distraction to an otherwise very solid movie. He was only around in a half dozen scenes - had they simply removed the character altogether and tweaked the storyline (just a little!) so that the mission had been derailed as a result of computer malfunction and/or human error, this movie would have been fantastic. Someone else commented that this movie \\"filled him with ambivalence\\". Well put. Sunshine is certainly still worth watching in spite of its flaws. But when it is over, it will be difficult not to wonder why the director ended it this way.

0596004966|5.0|This book provides a quick and concise reference to the C++ language, covering everything from the basic structure of C++ files (including #include guards) and programs to variables and operators to the Object-Oriented features of the language.  However, if you are looking for a detailed description of the C++ language, get [[ASIN:0201700735 The C++ Programming Language: Special Edition (3rd Edition)]] along with this book and you will have that plus a quick reference to almost all of the non-STL topics the other book talks about.

084428596X|5.0|Okay... so if your \\"learning\\" style consists only of popping a CD in and listening while you paint your toenails or watch a football game (and you have an extra 8 to 10 years to learn a language in this fashion), this is not the book for you!<br /><br />However, if you're not a fan of the so-called \\"modern\\" approach, and if you are not afraid to think, and if you believe that learning a language actually takes effort on your part, and if you would like to really get to know the language and how it functions, and if you would like to speak/write with your own sentences (that you made up all by yourself!!!)... well, great! This is a WONDERFUL book for you.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the modern trend in language learning is to treat us all like children. We are not children, and many of us don't want to spend the eight years or so which it takes to reach proficiency using that approach. This book will bridge the gap and give you the details/structure that most of the other course books are afraid to include. It's very organized. And even better, it doesn't get carried away with minute detail as some grammar books tend to do. At the same time, it is thorough enough so that you won't have a bunch of unanswered questions and incomplete concepts. It's a very logical progression and there are plenty of examples.<br /><br />You know, if this book had vocabulary lists with recorded pronunciation, lots of written exercises/translations, about 10 CD's of realistic/native spoken dialog with transcription, oral repetition/exercises, and a good Leitner-System-based flash card software application... well, wouldn't life be grand?

I loved the first one. That one was great and I've probably watched it six or seven times. The second, not so much. That one was garbage. I think this one is good. Erase APOCOLYPSE from the trilogy and go with the other two movies and you got a good set. I recommend this myself. I thought it was a pretty good movie.
B00005JPUN|5.0|The Invasion is one of the BEST zombie thrillers I've ever seen (along with I Am Legend.) Nicole Kidman does a great job as does Daniel Craig. The tension is very convincing and very real, and the special effects and musical score totally bring the tension to it's peak. If you love film's full of sci-fi goodness, extreme intensity and wonderful plot and characters: \\"The Invasion\\" is your movie.
B000002513|5.0|The best CD from Bruce - EVER.     It's a brilliant mix of Rock, Folk, Latino, Classical, R and B, Blues and Jazz. You need to be willing to shift gears as you listen to this one. Not for those who like a steady groove for an entire album. The material is varied, the  musicianship is superlative and the production's great. The last album with drummer Vincent Lopez and the band suffers for his loss.     From punchy rock to slow musical poetry and all points in between. Truly a collaborative effort from all the musicians. Poignant, gentle, passionate,fierce and featuring stunning tempo shifts and arrangements. The poetry paints pictures of characters and stories that transcend their Jersey origins and speak to us all about youthful tragedy, love and the longing to be free.    I've been listening to this for over 30 years and never get tired of it. An intersection of genius, passion and musicianship that is so much more than the sum total of it's parts.
B000XA5K4I|5.0|What do some people expect from a movie that is appropriately titled Shoot 'Em Up?  It is what it is, and that's a movie that is a fast paced action adventure that revolves around gun fire, more gun fire, and even more gun fire throughout the movie.<br /><br />Approx. 90 minutes long, about 88 minutes filled with some sort of take your breath away gun-fire and action.  Leaves about 2 minutes to fill viewers in on what has caused the characters to be shooting each other.<br /><br />If you are looking for a lot of intrique and character development, look elsewhere.  There is a plot here, but you have to be patient and wait for the payoff that comes through and closes the loop on the story.
B000XCZGV8|5.0|When Zodiac was first released several months ago I was completely dissapointed with the product...hardly any special features.  With such a huge subject matter such as the Zodiac...I expected mountains of features.    Well it's finally here and it was worth the wait.  The 1 hour and 47 minute documentary about the making of the film is incredibly interesting.  The amount of detail put to every aspect of the film is unbelievable.  David Fincher's careful eye is explained and celebrated in this very thorough documentary.  The documentary takes it's time and doesn't rush through behind the scenes footage like other documentaries for Special Features...you really get to see the the film making process as it's happening.      The other 2 documentaries are under \\"The Facts\\" section of the special features.  These documentaries are new interviews with actual investigators and survivors from the Zodiac killings.  Unbelievable.  The interviews are gripping and incredibly hypnotizing.  Every survivor that is still alive is captured on tape here.  These are very NEW interviews--just for this DVD.      The entire package is worth it.  Finally: this great movie gets a packaged DVD set that delivers the goods.
B000008DXB|5.0|I beg to disagree. This is exceptional Cale, among the very very best, in my mind and in my ears.
078619488X|3.0|We've taken this one out of our local library and the tracking on the cds is incredibly annoying. In spite of tracking every few minutes, and that these are *very* short tales, often only 2-3 tracks long, not one of the stories we have heard thusfar begins at the beginning of a track. That's right, there is no way to hear any of these stories (including the first one, The Tale of Peter Rabbit) without fast forwarding through a track to find the beginning. What was Blackstone THINKING when they broke the tracks up like this?! Needless to say, we shall not be purchasing a copy of this one - we'll go looking for the Shelley Frasier version (Tantor) instead.
0440238609|5.0|These books are absolutely amazing. I only wish I'd have read them years ago as a child. Whatever the case, the message still holds strong. The characters are riveting, the action is immense. There was simply no way for me to put the book down. I think what drew me into \\"His Dark Materials\\" was without a doubt the messages. What Pullman was writing is nothing new, yet it was so refreshing to read the approach he took to it. I recommend the trilogy to everyone I know and ask them to read with an open mind. To allow themselves to become absorbed in the story - because it truly is a beautiful one.     Highly recommended!
6304779356|5.0|When I think of the 80's, I think of the Lost Boys. And whenever I think of the Lost Boys, I think of the summer of 1987. The Lost Boys is one of those \\"My Generation\\" films for those of us who grew up in the 80's. I beleive that the Lost Boys is a movie that could of ONLY  been made and  taken place in the 1980's.  I dont think a sequel would work to well in 2008.  This is my favorite movie of all time. Every time I watch it; it  takes me back 21 years ago when the 80's  \\"hair\\" rock was the fashion.  Joel Schumacher (the director) grew up in the 1950's, and this is his tribute to \\"The Outsiders\\" genre. The soundtrack is just as good; I beleive at least half of the success of The Lost Boys movie  is due to the music soundtrack. I own both. It came out in July 1987- the perfect atmosphere for those getting out of high school. This is a movie that can be watched in the summer time -  or at Halloween time.  There is not one dull moment in this film.  Party all night-sleep all day-never grow old and never die! Its fun to be a vampire!     Own it today; you will not be disapointed! As of October 2009, 96% of reviewers  on Amazon give this film a high review.  Get the special edition DVD if you can. The bonus disc really gives you alot of insight into the making of the movie with interviews by both Coreys, Keifer Sutherland, the make up artist, the camera man and the director and more.  UPDATE:  RIP Corey Haim who died on my birthday (March 10). THis will give me all the more reason to remember him.
B000JIHP88|3.0|I found it hard to get this mobile on the crib.  I am worried it will fall on the baby!  It's a heavy base. I actually used floss to help secure it.  I like the mobile, though.  It's intricate so I'm not sure how durable it is.  My 2 month-old likes it.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|This is hardly the work of genius. Just a really crappy movie, masquerading as camp. About half way through the movie, I found if I used a 10x Fast Forward speed, the movie was a lot more enjoyable. Worst movie dialogue, EVER. Quinton should publicly apologize for this horrible flick.
0805079831|4.0|I think this book is pretty much right on, Ms Klein only dropping the ball in assuming that decline follows shock as a result of evil-moneybag machinations, rather than as an adaptation to the diminishing freedom  attendant upon increasing population density (freedom requiring elbow-room, as any denizen of the New World knows; that's why we came here in the first place!).   The culprit is our God given proclivity to breed ourselves into oblivion (i.e. the enemy is us!).  The Evil-Moneybags are simply riding on the coattails of the Global Population-Explosion, applying insights from  synthetic-annealing in an attempt to assure that, of the 2 possible phase-transitions which can exit from the critical-state the world enters when the population-explosion maxes-out (i.e. exploding into anarchy, or freezing-up into despotism), it's the latter which we'll follow.    I think this oversight on the author's part is gender based, females, with their reproduction-drive to complement the male sex-drive, generally seeming to have a blind-spot in this area.  ( Yes, I'm a Sexist, wondering why God would create 2 different sexes if He expected them both to be the same.  I even think Godhead itself has evolved to the point where it needs to have 2 different sexes to continue, Gaia being the female, which we have direct experience with, & God the male, which we don't, & can only wonder about.  God doesn't intervene in Gaia's affairs much out of respect for His Better-Half (Better in that She embodies the fundamental mystery which bemuses Him, the mystery of His origin.  But that's another story...)
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Having only seen only one of the Firefly TV episodes (not going in with much back story) this was a fun generally family appropriate Sci-Fi movie.  Careful with the extras as they contain several F-Bombs.
B000003N7K|5.0|I see there are 11 people who need to see a neurosurgeon.  Why else would they not give it 5 stars?  How good do you have to get before you merit 5 stars?  Okay, maybe I'm wrong about that.  But, this is one of a handful of albums that seems perfect in every sense of the word.  The songs are subjectively very pretty--they weren't trying to break new ground with dicey material.  The side men are top notch musicians (which can't be said of most albums--there are usually weak links in the chain).  All these cats know how to accompany a voice, which they do in an almost Schubert-esque manner.  They knew how and when to get out of Hartman's way, which is lost on most musicians who seem to be on some kind of hell-bent-for-leather ego trip to take the spotlight.  The sound is spectacular too.  Check out the German audiophile vinyl release.  It's so good it leaves me speechless.  I approach this album like a prime cut of meat, or a fine wine, or a loved one:  it is very special and deserves your total attention.
055358894X|2.0|I was prepared to like this book but couldn't get past the tedious and lengthy descriptions of the scenery, the clothing, the way of things, etc etc etc.  The elaborate descriptiveness totally got in the way of the story.  I skipped ahead a few times to see if it was possible to get by the tedium but finally gave up in frustration.  I read for pleasure and there are too many good books out there to waste time on the hum drum.
B00004R99F|5.0|On the last day of school before summer vacation, Goofy's teenage son Max plans to interrupt an assembly with a song and dance number to win the attention of the girl of his dreams, Roxanne. Emulating his pop-star hero, Powerline, Max pulls off the stunt long enough to gain major popularity points with his peers and get the date he was hoping for, but not without landing himself in the principal's office to boot. A phone call to his dad instantly foils Max's plans for a summer of love, as Goofy becomes convinced that he needs to spend some quality time with his son. Before he can escape, Max is whisked away on a cross-country road trip to Goofy's favorite fishing spot, but he manages to squeeze in one last talk with Roxanne on the way. Unfortunately, in a final effort to keep Roxanne from finding another date to her friend Stacey's concert watching party, Max promises to wave to her from the stage when he and his dad join Powerline in the final number! Suddenly, he's told the biggest lie of his life and has no idea how to get out of it. When Max decides to alter Goofy's treasured family map halfway through the trip and head them towards the concert in L.A., he finally starts to have a good time, but at what price?<br /><br />\\"A Goofy Movie\\" was a surprise gem from Disney in 1995 that surely would have made Walt proud! The writing and animation are top notch, with a completely original, believable, hilarious and charming father/son story expanding on the popular \\"Goof Troop\\" TV series from 1992. In this bigscreen feature, Max and his friend P.J. have moved on to high school, and Pete is still around to cause trouble for Goofy with his nasty demeanor and awful advice. Absent with no explanation, however, are Pete's wife Peg and small daughter, Pistol, and both Goofy and Pete now work as baby photographers in a retail store. The characters are just as we remember them though, and looking better than ever, only the older Max is now voiced by James Marsden. But don't worry if you never watched \\"Goof Troop\\" back in the day. This movie completely stands on its own feet as a solid and highly entertaining story of its own, and Goofy (Bill Farmer) and Pete (Jim Cummings) are not much different than they were in their classic Disney shorts. Some major new characters are created for the film too, like Pauly Shore's Bobby, a high school friend of Max and P.J.'s, and the adorable Roxanne, voiced by the equally adorable Kellie Martin. The film boasts some excellent original songs too, and just about all the goofy fun you can handle!<br /><br />The Gold Collection DVD of \\"A Goofy Movie\\" is so close to being outstanding that it's a real shame they missed the mark by making it fullscreen only! Other than that, it is surprisingly generous with extras (for a Disney release), especially considering the quality of those extras. The two most notable are \\"Calling All Goofs\\", an episode of the TV series \\"Goof Troop\\" billed on this DVD as a \\"Max and Goofy Cartoon\\" and omitting the opening song, and \\"A Goofy Success Story\\", which is a wonderful episode of the old Disney anthology series in full color and introduced by Walt that tells the tale of how Goofy was discovered in Hollywood by talent scouts and became the award winning star he is today! That second program includes four classic Disney shorts edited to fit the context of the story, but more importantly, it includes a large amount of charming new (at the time) animation to tell the behind the scenes story of Goofy's success. In addition to those two excellent extras, the DVD includes the theatrical trailer, a trivia game, and a read-along story of the movie that may seem pointless to us but would be great if you have young children. Though, an original story might have been better than just a read-along version of the film. Truthfully, I suppose it would also have been nice to have some more extras relating to the film itself, like character design art (especially for Roxanne) and a behind the scenes featurette, but with \\"A Goofy Success Story\\" and an entire episode of Goof Troop, it's pretty tough to complain about anything other than that fullscreen presentation. Fullscreen or not though, this film is a must own! If you don't have it, I highly recommend it! For the Goofy fan, the extras alone make it a worthy purchase! I also highly recommend the direct-to-video sequel, \\"An Extremely Goofy Movie.\\" Yeah, it's lower budget, but it is far better than your average Disney direct-to-video sequel. And, seek out Walt Disney Treasures: The Complete Goofy if you don't have it already. I just wish they would hurry-up and release Sport Goofy in \\"Soccermania\\" to DVD already, not to mention \\"Goof Troop\\" in volume sets like they have for Duck Tales, Tale Spin, Gummi Bears, and Rescue Rangers. I suppose The Wuzzles should come first though. Disney, are you listening?, but with \\"A Goofy Success Story\\" and an entire episode of Goof Troop, it's pretty tough to complain about anything other than that fullscreen presentation.

B000YA82F6|3.0|I never really noticed the explosion of \\"indie\\" style and culture until fairly recently.  I graduated from college in May and even then I only had two classes, so somehow I missed all of the fashionable people in skinny jeans and Chuck Taylors walking around campus.  Someone will usually shout you down if you use the term indie too lightly, but to me the meaning has changed.  Before it was music or film that was made outside of major labels or major studios, and now it's a term used to describe cutsey and twee entertainment aimed at well scrubbed white folk.  There's nothing really independent about this stuff now, it's incredibly popular.      That's exactly what Juno is, and boy does it try hard to be cool.  Everything from the over written dialogue, to the Wes Anderson style, to the name dropping of hip bands just exudes an air of coolness.  The movie starts out with some rapid fire dialogue, with a ROLFMAO dropped in there somewhere and of course plenty of \\"girls can talk trash too\\" type of dialogue.  About 10 minutes in I had a feeling that this could be overbearing as hell.    Lucky for me the Juno actually has some heart.  Balanced among all of the hipster posturing and the over written dialogue is an actual heartwarming story.  It presents some tough choices for the main character Juno McGuff, played well by Ellen Page.  When she goes to an abortion clinic, she ends up leaving because she imagines her unborn baby with finger nails already.  Sometimes the smallest things remind you a persons (born or unborn) humanity.  She decides to give the baby up for adoption, and finds a seemingly idyllic couple in the Lorings.      Vanessa Loring, played by Jennifer Garner, easily the least hip person in the whole movie, adds a lot of depth to the story.  Her unabashed yearning for motherhood really helps this movie from disappearing up its own behind with cultural references and detached irony.  Jason Bateman plays Vanessa's husband Mark Loring, a hip composer of commercial jingles who used to play in a rock band.  He's basically a grown up adolescent, watching corny horror movies and listening to Sonic Youth while his wife if off doing Pilates or whatever.  You know he's cool because his band opened for the Melvins.  Juno and Mark both develop some strange feelings for each other.  Juno thinks he's a really cool guy and an ideal father at first, and thinks Vanessa may be too straight laced.  But when Mark becomes more transparent in his intentions, Juno gets turned off.  Suffice to say things become very complicated between Juno, Mark, and Vanessa.        Juno also has to come to terms with her goofy boyfriend Paulie Bleaker, played in a really subdued way by Michael Cera.  Cera isn't always this narcoleptic, but he plays the role of a shy and awkward teenager fairly well.  He obviously has trouble expressing himself to Juno, and he portrays that well on screen.  Juno's father, played by JK Simmons also shines.  He's easily the most naturally funny actor in the whole movie.  He delivers some genuinely funny lines, but he's also a loving father and very supportive, something that you don't see to often when a teenage mother is portrayed.        Despite the obvious heart to the story, the cutesy twee elements started to irritate me after awhile.  The straight from Wes Anderson cross country runners dressed like weirdo's, the overbearing indie rock crooner soundtrack, and of course the overt name dropping of cool bands all seemed a bit contrived.  Juno's favorite bands are The Stooges, Patti Smith, and the Runaways, I mean, how cool is she?  Despite her penchant for raw power punk rock, the soundtrack is about as limp as they come.  It's all Belle and Sebastian, Cat Power, and Kimya Dawson.  I don't even think there's a single instance of percussion on the entire soundtrack, it's all acoustic balladry.     Like many people, I'm beginning to feel a backlash towards this type of cinema and music.  It always irritates me a little to hear some of my favorite bands like The Shins get co-opted by commercials and movies, and sometimes I want to yell for these folks to get a backbone.  But in spite of these flaws, I enjoyed this movie.  It's not as great as someone like Roger Ebert would have you believe (it was his favorite movie of 2007), but it was a solid movie nonetheless.
B0000CNY27|4.0|Hadn't seen this movie in over twenty years, the premise is excelent but I have a hard time buying Kurt Russell as a bad guy, specially since his character seems to have just had a shampoo 20 minutes before every shot.  In today's big movies one spends so much time pleading: no more CGI ! but while watching ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK I had the opposite feeling. Sure, it's got a couple of pretty good special effects shots but once Snake lands the plane you just never really feel you're truly in NYC.  Many great things about this Special Edition but the video and audio themselves are not two of them. The night shoots look specially bad (with the movie itself set mostly at midnight). Fact of the matter is this was a very low budget film that was made to look more expensive than it actually was thanks to the ingenuity of the film makers involved(be sure to watch the making of documentary and you'll agree).  On the whole this is a pretty good film, not in the same stratosphere as its contemporary BLADE RUNNER but definetely not a bad time at the movies.
0143038419|5.0|One of the most inspiring books I have ever read-very relatable, encouraging, and the exact words I needed to hear.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|The Good Things:<br />-Plenty of action and special effects, particuarly for a TV show.<br />-The drama is not bad.<br />-Everything seems to correspond well with the first two movies (they're making the show under the assumption that T3 never really happened...oh well).  T2 did tie up all loose ends, but the show acknowledges this, and the characters have to find out how Judgement Day continues to happen.<br />-Characters are true to the first two movies (Sarah Connor seemed too weak at first, but she took on her usual tough-woman attitude very quickly).<br />-The guy playing the terminator is not as great as Schwartzenegger, but he does okay for himself, and has a few menacing moments.<br />-The other actors are fine.<br />-Some good ideas and more insight on the terminator universe (more on time travel, futuristic weapons, and so on).<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Some of it feels like the same old thing...Sarah and John are on the run again!<br />-No liquid metal terminators (at least not yet...)<br />-Some of the camera movements were jittery or hyper.<br />-Will we ever see the world end? This could become a very long and drawn-out saga...<br /><br />Even though the first few minutes of the pilot episode had me worried, it quickly redeemed itself.  It fits well with the first two films, the action was swell, and the drama was not too boring to watch.  Unlike most other shows, I enjoyed watching this, and I hope to see more episodes.  Reccomend watching T1 and T2 first.
B00007LTIB|5.0|I'm not the biggest Yes fan you'll ever meet (if you DO in fact, ever meet me) but \\"The Gates Of Delirium\\" is a really fantastic multi-structured progressive rock masterpiece. This bad boy is over 20 minutes long, and only gets better with time. My favorite part is the instrumental section that begins around the 8 minute mark. From that point until the very end we're treated to some of the finest prog that was ever laid down on tape with all kinds of guitar and drum twists and turns and a positively beautiful vocal melody at the very end. It's just perfect. Oh, and the rest of the album (the second half) ain't bad either.
B00012FXAE|5.0|This just goes to show that sequals can be as good as the originals.  Aliens is such a good sequal because it takes the series into a very different and refreshing direction.  If it weren't for the Aliens and Ripley, this would have nothing familiar with the first Alien movie.  James Cameron takes over Ridley Scott's position from the first Alien, and makes a sequal just as worthy as the original.  Arguably better than the first Alien, both movies are very different that it is difficult to compare.  Alien was a horror movie set in space, while Aliens (though scary at times too) is mostly marine vs alien non-stop action.<br /><br />The story does pick up from the original Alien, though 50+ years in the future.  The pod Ripley escaped the Nostromo on has been found adrift and taken back to Earth.  The planet that the Alien ship was founded on in the first movie, has now been colonized, and Ripley's recollection of events of the Alien creature leads to an order for the colonists to investigate the ship.  When there is no response from the colonists, a team of marines is sent to infiltrate along with Ripley.<br /><br />While this particular edition contains both the theatrical release and the special addition of the film, I prefer watching the special addition.  It contains footage of the colonists investigation that is not shown in the theatrical release, among some other scenes, though that being the most important.<br /><br />In addition to the marine firepower concept added to this film, there are other things that have expanded from the first Alien.  My favorite is the introduction of the alien queen, who can be seen again in Alien:Resurrection and AVP.  This is my favorite film featuring the queen.  She doesn't give up on chasing Ripley, and makes a surprise comeback at the end of the film, featuring a suspensful and exciting brawl against Ripley in her mech-walker.<br /><br />Its difficult to say if you are a fan of the original Alien that you will love this sequal, but it is a great sequal that brings huge new ideas to the franchise.  If you want to see lots of menacing creatures getting wiped by a group of marines (and marines getting wiped by them) this is possibly the best film ever made to showcase that.<br /><br />Acting - 4<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 4.5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5hat brings huge new ideas to the franchise.

0375842209|5.0|It was a great book and I recommend it to anybody who likes WWII and books about rights, so READ THIS BOOK NOW it's worth it. It shows the point of view of death itself for a while then to the girl and then back again.  This book is really good,A MUST READ!
B000UGG3A0|5.0|I've enjoyed Dropkick Murphys for a few years now, but I thought they might have peaked out with Blackout. The 2003 release marked a significant improvement from previous efforts, but the momentum didn't continue on 2005's The Warrior's Code. Fortunately, The Meanest of Times picks up where Blackout left off. Scratch that. I think it's better. (You heard me.) Both are solid from front to back, but Meanest feels as if the Murphys have finally found their essential sound. After four good but slightly raw (and not in the good way) albums, and one excellent attempt to stretch their limits (but still making an obvious effort to brandish their Celtic roots), DM has arrived - confident, talented, mature, energetic, and yes - very much Celtic.    Be careful with this one. You might not be able to put it down.    -Brandon
B000QUCNP4|4.0|David Fincher is not known for directing deep, involving, thoughtful films, but this departure is a very good one. I remember the Zodiac killings when they were happening, and the fact that no one was ever caught, and the sense of frustration comes through in every frame. The extremely complex chain of events, stretching over a period of twenty years, is very smoothly handled. In fact, the editing -- which is crucial in a story like this -- is nearly perfect. The story comes mostly from the book by Robert Graysmith (nicely played here as an obsessed nerd by Jake Gyllenhaal). Mark Ruffalo plays the lead cop on the case, whose career is shaken in the process, and Robert Downey, Jr., plays Paul Avery, the San Francisco Chronicle crime reporter whom the case helps turn into an alcoholic. The story pulls the viewer in, winding you up in its web of facts and interpretations and hesitancies. The sloppiness of nearly all the cops is startling, as is the cavalier treatment of evidence by the journalists involved; I suspect people today, used to CSI on TV and to the widespread forensic use of DNA, would react quite differently. An excellent film.
B000N3SRRC|3.0|I had high hopes for this band, as it came recommended from a fellow OmniNerd and had provoked reviews elsewhere that included comparisons to Soundgarden - but I was disappointed. Chalk it up to choosing the wrong album to use as an introduction to the band, or perhaps to the nuances of my personal taste, if you like, but the sound was too far into the prog-rock camp. The album does have it's moments - sometimes reminding me of Corrosion of Conformity or Faith No More, and sometimes successfully pulling off their own thing - but Clutch is unable to stretch these into a complete album.    It's difficult to put my finger on the problem. I just find many of the songs ... well ... boring. (And in some cases even annoying. The \\"vaminos, vaminos\\" part of Electric Worry really irks me.) I had a similar experience during my foray into Ben Harper. Like Clutch, the idea of Harper's sound was appealing, but it felt as if it was stretched thin over an entire album.    In the end, the handful of promising tracks (e.g., You Can't Stop Progress, The Devil and Me, and One Eye Dollar) aren't enough to pull Clutch into the 4-star range. I really want to give high scores to songs with names like When Vegans Attack and catchy chorus lyrics like \\"Mr. Shiny Cadillac-ness,\\" but I can't fake it. (I'm an Eagle Scout.)    -Brandon
6303589162|2.0|Body Double, 1984 film<br /><br />The film begins in a graveyard. A dead body opens its eyes and roars. They are filming a horror movie. Something has gone wrong. Jake returns home to find a surprise. After a drink he finds a new home. He auditions for another job; he meets a new friend who offers him a house-sitting job. Sam says he must water the plants every evening. A telescope shows a neighbor. [Does this remind you of “Rear Window”?] Scully notices something and follows that woman in her car, then to a shopping mall. He notices some man following her, but calls attention to himself. [This film has a lot of padding that shows scenes of Los Angeles, and is slow paced.]<br /><br />They walk on the beach, that man grabs her purse and runs away. Scully can’t stand an enclosed space like a tunnel. [Does this recall “Vertigo”?] The story ambles on. Jake sees a threat to Gloria and tries to help her. But the dog attacks Jake! Why doesn’t it attack the intruder? Jake is too late to help Gloria.[An argument for being armed at home?] The police detective questions Jake as a witness and a suspect. Jake says he does not know the husband Alexander Revell. Later Jake watches a TV show and recognizes a woman by a tattoo on her cheek. He begins to investigate and visits an adult movie studio to learn more about “Holly Body”. [Any relation to a Hitchcock actress?] Jake discovers the secret of that performance, then calls the police. There is a development with new drama in a reservoir. A secret identity is revealed. Will this nightmare ever end? The final scene shows the use of a “body double”, then the credits roll at the end.<br /><br />“Blow Out” was much better film, perhaps his best. One flaw in this film is the failure of the police to investigate the background of Jake. The biggest flaw was the failure to investigate the alibi of the estranged husband, even if he was in Chicago (and drove a Bronco). This film also suffers from its sleazy tone. All the characters are losers. The ending is somewhat ironic. “It seems crazy” is a fair description. This story is less credible when watched a second time.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|While this is a 5 star show, I agree that the packaging of this set is cheap and leaves a lot to be desired for the price.  Taking a tip from another reviewer, I found a great dvd case at walmart for this set.  Its a 48 capacity disk box by Vault for about $20. It is a hard case, not just a soft wallet style.  All 48 disks fit well with two extra pockets for the special features disk and the paper foldout that comes with this DVD set.    Just thought the info might help someone.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|This movie is in French with English subtitles (I ordered it from here).  It is one of the funnies French movies I have ever seen.  My husband, who does not speak french and doesn't usually enjoy French movies, even loved it!  The humor did not get lost in translation.  I also enjoy Thierry Lhermitte very much, and he is one of the main characters in this film.  I teach French and I showed this film to my students (PG-13 french films are hard to come by) -- they loved it!  The did wish there was a sequel however... ;)  Worth buying at such an inexpensive price and adding it to your collection!
B00005V9IK|1.0|What a yawnfest! I'm not surprised Americans would get worked up about the White House being blown up but talk about projection! The US is the most aggressive nation ever. So, small wonder it would be the ultimate threat if an alien army attacked the US.    In other words, it is perfectly ok for the US to attack any country but heaven forbid if anyone, human or alien, attacks the US.    Dull plot, dull everything, no amount of special effects can make up for that.
0374530718|5.0|Robin Wong     Sophie's World by Jostein Gaarder is a fantastically wonderful novel about a girl who embarks onto a philosophical wonderland. Sophie, the main character receives mysterious letters and before she knows it is learning about philosophy. The book is comprised of a story about Sophie and in between the parts of her life (the plot) and the philosophy lessons (the lessons) she undergoes. Sophie's World is probably best characterized as an educational, philosophical, page-turning, mystery novel. The plot is like a cake because it has layers of mystery and suspense, wonder, and thought provocation. Within the plot is a mystery, within the mystery a philosophy lesson, within the philosophy lesson, a thought and within the thought life.    Sophie's world is a book filled with an amazing plot, two simultaneous story lines, a philosophy class, and of course a few plot twists. Although the lessons can tend to be a bit boring at times, they are definitely worth persevering through. They can be very useful especially in understanding deeper meanings that are hidden within the plot. The lessons contained within the book provide a phenomenal base for philosophy. If you're interested in philosophy, then Sophie's World is a perfect book. The book has references to at least 17 great philosophers of the entire course of history. Sophie's World is truly a novel about the history of philosophy. It can easily be used as an instructional book keeping students interested in the plot while learning and understanding the history of philosophy.    The plot is one big roller coaster of wonder. Sophie's world is a huge page turner (at the plot sections), but can be difficult to get through during the lessons. How much the book interests you really depends on your level of philosophical interest. If you really don't like philosophy that much, you'll probably end up skipping to all of the sections of plot. If you are really interested in philosophy, then you will probably love thisbook as much as I did.    The book is filled with references to everything from Winnie-The-Pooh to the United Nations which are actually quite amusing. Once you get to a certain point in the story, you will realize the book is one giant metaphor for something else. Even when you aren't being directly taught about philosophy, you are still learning about philosophy (it will make sense once you've read the book). One of the lines in the book is about re-reading the book to see if you missed anything in between the lines.   The book is written from a narrated outside point of view. The story follows Sophie through her life, but it also goes to a world beyond her own. The story then moves to beyond Sophie's story itself and goes back. The book is really almost a story within a story.     Sophie's World is definitely a book worth reading, even if you don't have a particular interest in philosophy. It is and extremely well-written book and although long, a must-read. I can easily see why Sophie's World is critically acclaimed and on the best-sellers list. Enjoy!

0060566108|5.0|The authors spent six years studying visionary companies to see what accounts for their success. Their goal: to uncover the underlying factors that helped the visionary companies outperform the competition.     The authors chose eighteen visionary companies for their book: 3M; American Express; Boeing; Citicorp; Ford; General Electric; Hewlett-Packard; IBM; Johnson & Johnson; Marriott; Merck; Motorola; Nordstrom; Philip Morris; Procter & Gamble; Sony; Wal-Mart; and Walt Disney. These are the premier organizations in their field; firms that have a long record of having an impact on the world. They have distinguished themselves as a special and elite breed of institution. And, with an average founding date of 1897, and stock-return performance of fifteen times the general market since 1926, they are companies that have stood the test of time.    Some of the main factors for success were: To preserve the values that set your company apart from others; to set audacious goals; and to experiment freely.    The authors use the following analogy: Suppose you read of a person who could tell the exact time just by looking at the position of the sun or stars. \\"It's April 23, 1996, 2:36 A.M.\\" Wow, you'd think. What a remarkable person. Yet wouldn't it be more remarkable--and useful for the world--if that person built a clock that anyone could refer to, even after the clockmaker had died? Having a great idea, or being a charismatic, visionary leader is like \\"time telling.\\" Building a company that's healthy long after the visionary leader is gone, or after the great product is passé, is \\"clock building.\\"    Visionary company founders concentrate first on the organization's systems and values, then on products. In fact, you don't need a great product idea to begin. William Hewlett and David Packard of Hewlett- Packard, for instance, had no product in mind when they got together in 1937. They just wanted to start a company together. Early products included a bowling foul-line indicator, a clock drive for a telescope, and a device to make a urinal flush automatically. They persisted until they figured out how to build a firm that could pump out great products. Likewise, Masaru Ibuka didn't have a single product in mind when he launched Sony in 1945. The company survived selling heating pads. Paul Galvin, Motorola's founder, didn't dream about making battery eliminators for radios, its first product. He dreamed foremost about building a great and lasting company. He did that by developing people. He encouraged dissent, discussion, and disagreement, and he gave people freedom to make contributions. He set challenges and gave people responsibility to achieve them.     Here are some interesting notes I took:    Though many visionary companies have had high-profile leaders like Henry Ford or Sam Walton, charismatic leadership is not necessary for success. 3M, for example, has never had a charismatic CEO.    The firm is not a vehicle for products or personalities; products are a vehicle for the company. Looked at in that light, Walt Disney's greatest creation wasn't Snow White or Disneyland, it's the Disney Company and its ability to make people happy.    Purposes are your organization's fundamental reasons for existing beyond making money. They are broad and enduring. For example, Robert W. Johnson founded Johnson & Johnson \\"to alleviate pain and suffering.\\" Purposes are not about specific products or services. The Disney Company doesn't exist to \\"make cartoons for kids,\\" for example. It exists to \\"use our imaginations to bring happiness to millions.\\" Asked whether he started Marriott Corporation to create an empire, J. Willard Marriott, Sr., said no. He wanted to give friendly service to guests, provide good food at a fair price, and work hard to make a profit to create more jobs.    Merck has long used its values to guide its actions. For example, it once developed a drug called Mectizan to cure a Third World disease known as \\"river blindness.\\"While it hoped to sell the drug to government and relief agencies, the return on investment would be small. When it came time to sell Mectizan, however, no one bought it. So Merck gave the drug away to the millions who needed it. This was good public relations that could pay off down the road. But it was also because the company has never forgotten George Merck's words: \\"We try never to forget that medicine is for people. It's not for the profits. The profits follow . . .\\"    To come up with a purpose, ask: What is our reason for being? What would be lost if we ceased to be?    Boeing's core value, \\"being in the leading edge of aviation; being pioneers\\" is permanent. Whatever your business, strategy and tactics, operations, culture, and products are they must change over time. The only thing that shouldn't change is core ideology. When Eastern Airlines said it needed a jet with precise specifications, Boeing took on the challenge. The plane had to land on runway 4-22 at La Guardia Airport in New York, a notoriously short runway. This jet also had to be able to fly non-stop to Miami without refueling, seat six abreast, and hold 131 passengers. Most agreed this was an impossible task. Boeing met the challenge with its 727. It succeeded because, once it got going, it had no other choice. Such goals are always aligned with a Boeing core value: to be on the leading edge of aviation.    Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing's initial idea, to mine corundum, failed, and the company searched desperately for something to do. 3M settled on sandpaper and grinding wheels, which kept it afloat. Such troubles led CEO William McKnight to insist on diversifying. But rather than chart the course himself, he built an organization that would continually change based on the initiative of employees. McKnight hired good people, let them alone to do their work, and encouraged experimentation. The result was many unplanned, successful products. For example, 3M employee Dick Drew was visitingan auto paint shop when he saw a problem to solve. Two-toned paint jobs had become popular, but shops had trouble separating the two colors. Drew went to work and came up with a solution: masking tape. Five years later, he used his experience to develop Scotch tape. Note that 3M hadn't planned to get into tape, now a huge part of its business. It was an outgrowth of the organization McKnight created.    Visionary companies don't ask, \\"How well are we doing?\\" They ask, \\"How can we do better tomorrow than we did today?\\" This question requires constant self-criticism and investment in the future for a race with no finish line.    Motorola has used an \\"innovate or die\\" technique. It has been known to cut off mature product lines that still account for significant sales volume in order to keep innovating.    Boeing uses a process called \\"eyes of the enemy.\\" It assigns managers the task of developing strategy as though they worked for a competitor and wanted to wipe Boeing off the map. What weaknesses would they exploit? What markets could they invade? Boeing then figures out how it would respond to each threat.    A visionary company is like a great work of art--magnificent in detail, with all elements working together in concert.
B00005JPAO|5.0|I still stand in amazement that Peter Morgan's ingenious and character-angst rich screenplay THE QUEEN did not win the 2007 Oscar.Sometimes I just sit back and sigh and say \\"What the.....\\" when Awards are bestowed.<br /><br />Revisiting THE QUEEN, now, after first seeing it in the theatres,I was struck with how utterly prophetic Peter Morgan's script so aptly directed by Stephen Frears is.Helen Mirren, unquestionably \\"queenly\\" in her inhabitation of Queen Elizabeth of England, prophetically proclaims to Tony Blair (after the whole Diana funeral had come to a close) how incredibly difficult and hurtful it was to her to see that 1 out of 4 Brits actually hated her during her indecision with protocol over Diana's death.Mirren advises quite soberly.\\"It will happen to you Mr.Blair...quite suddenly,without warning!\\" Were ever more Royal expressions  more true.<br /><br />The one genius of this script is that it not only attempts to humanize and demonize The Royals and the new Prime Minister,but it shows the inescapable political charade that all parties were forced to play in a moment's notice.Princess Diana has died.She is no longer a Royal.Tony Blair has just won a landslide victory for his Party,and Queen Elizabeth if forced to face 1000 years of Monarchical Protocol in the light of such sudden events,especially in the light of her disapproval of Diana AND the new Prime Minister.<br /><br />What a travesty that this film was only recognized with one single Oscar-that of Helen Mirren,who rightfully deserved it.How many times have I heard, \\"OH,the movie where Helen Mirren plays The Queen!\\".But this film is so much more than the acting of Helen Mirren.Michael Sheen as Tony Blair is every bit as important in making this film work,and the Alexandre Desplats soundtrack and the adept direction of Stephen Frears made this SUCH a neat,tidy,seamless and \\"positively practically English\\" look at how world leaders deal with events.<br /><br />Well. Mr.Blair IS gone from office...\\"quite suddenly, and without warning\\" and The Queen STILL sits upon her throne.This film should be rewatched often and with great warning to those in high offices. The Queen eventually did what was right for the people,even though everything in her said \\"NO\\".Oh,Mr.Blair....why did you not heed your own advice?
B000UBMZ4S|5.0|This title looks and plays great in both the Toshiba A35 & Xbox 360 HD DVD players.  Before this release I had never seen Blade Runner before and often pondered several of the DVD releases before HD DVD was ever available.      This film almost never came on cable (if it did I never saw it) and I said finally I'm buying in for HD DVD; and the results are amazing!  Its kind of hard to imagine this film being a 1982 film, it looks like it was made in the late 90s or something.  The picture is nice and crisp and its sci-fi entertainment at its best.  The only indication that this was an old film was the original sound recording from the 80's era.  Still sounds really good, especially the score.     You get 5 discs loaded with extras for only $27.95, its well worth every penny and more!!!  Now I am definitely looking for more Ridley Scott films to be released in High Def, namely Legend and American Gangster!

We thought our really smart brother would kick all our butts, but we (the other brother, my son, and I) put him in his place. I would recommend this game to people who like a challenge, but it is easy enough that you don't feel stupid if you don't do well.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Everyone knows his face.Everyone has seen him since he premiered in HBO's [[ASIN:6304233787 Deadly Voyage]]  and followed a year later in [[ASIN:0783231202 Amistad]].In 2007 he was in [[ASIN:B000VNMMVQ Talk to Me (Widescreen Edition)]] opposite Don Cheadle, and opposite Denzel and Crowe in [[ASIN:B0011HOEYY American Gangster (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)]].Last year he was in [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men (Widescreen Edition)]] with Clive Owen! Well back up to 2006-7 to see him in his Golden Globe nominated breakout hilarious UK romp KINKY BOOTS ...'cause THAT is where CHIWETEL EJIOFOR struts his stuff. This amazingly talented, good looking 30 something British born African actor is always lurking in the shadows of the \\"leading men\\" of our day.BUT, as a sassy,no-nonsense transvestite London \\"Drag Queen\\" is where Ejiofor found his balance and voice, dressed in cabaret clothes and singing and dancing to \\"beat the band\\"!<br /><br />KINKY BOOTS tells the true story of how two young men trying to find their niche in life,both cast in disparaging lights by their father's expectations, who unlikely team up together to find their voice in this world and turn an almost defunct \\"sensible\\" shoe factory in Northampton,England into an industrious viable manufacturer of footwear strong enough to support the weight of the female impersonator.Ejiofor plays Simon,aka \\"Lola\\" who since earliest boyhood has romped his way through life as a man who can only be a man when he becomes a woman.Joel Edgerton is Clarley Price who is now the fifth and hopeful generation to carry on the craftsmanship of the sensible making \\"oxford shoe factory\\" Price Shoes.

0743298039|4.0|This is a great read -- well written, a little spooky, a little mysterious, and immensely captivating.  Won't rehash the storyline here, you can see other reviews for tha, but I did want to say that the story is a fine one to get lost in, and the ending is satisfying.  It's the perfect book to read if you find yourself snowed in this weekend.  Highly recommended.
0792843584|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever. I had watched it years ago in movie theaters in Paris and I wanted to watch it again. It is as good as I thought. The images are beautiful, the actors are great. Of course it is slow, of course it is more than 3 hours long, but this is a magnificient story. Do not miss it if you do not know it and watch it again if you have already...<br /><br />The story is not too far from the great book \\"A People's History of America\\" by H. Zinn. It shows the losers' view of history. But it is not sad, it is beautiful. Do not miss it.
B000002KNY|4.0|This album will never replace Remain in Light for me as the ultimate Talking Heads experience. But then, nothing will. Nonetheless Fear of Music is very audiophile, not unlike Remain in Light. There is a lot going on through each track, and much of it goes undetectable without the use of high frequency headphones. \\"Memories Can't Wait\\" is no doubt a great example of this. But unfortunately, despite all the cool arrangements, sounds, samples, and grooves on Fear of Music, there just isn't enough in the songwriting department. I feel like this album is very well produced, and I think the musicianship is prevalent. At times, Byrne is very witty. But there is no \\"Once in a Lifetime\\" on this album, even if \\"Air\\" comes fairly close. \\"What is happening to my skin?....Some people say not to worry about the air....but Air can hurt you too!\\" lol. It got a laugh out of me anyway.    This is a very worthwhile album. It really is worth listening to, just for all the ear candy injected into the stomach of this album. Especially on the stronger tracks, you can tell in the direction (Remain in Light) they are headed. Lyrically, we see Talking Heads near their best on \\"Air,\\" and \\"Heaven.\\" When listening to \\"Drugs,\\" for the first minute and a half I have to remind myself that this is not a Brian Eno record. Because until David Byrne starts in, \\"Drugs\\" could easily fit in as an instrumental in Before and After Science. Unfortunately, the vocals ruin the ambiance of this track. Good thing Eno did solo work.    Best tracks: Air, Life During Wartime, Memories Can't Wait, Heaven.

B000WC3AKI|4.0|This film is not high cinematic art. It was intended to be a summer blockbuster \\"put your brain on hold\\" action film when it was released in 1996, and that is what it was and still is. Its competition at the time was \\"Independence Day\\", which is an unwatchably hokey movie, and this movie is better than that film in that it is a watchably hokey movie. Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton play recently divorced storm chasers Jo and Bill Harding whose relationship was pulled apart by Jo's obsession with chasing tornadoes to the exclusion of wanting any kind of \\"normal family life\\" by Bill's definition. Bill has moved on and found a more conventional girl that he plans to marry (Jami Gertz). However, before he can move on, Bill needs Jo to sign some papers. He meets her \\"in the field\\" as she and her team from the university plan a day of chasing tornadoes through Oklahoma. Before they can conclude their business a storm calls the team to the chase, and Bill is drawn into the chase by necessity but kept there by his latent passion - for storm-chasing and maybe even for the marriage he left behind. The film features some great special effects, fast-paced action, and cringingly obvious dialogue with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. However if you're just in the mood for an action-packed film with a feel-good after effect, this movie fits the bill.<br /><br />A popular internet film database ranks this film as 5.9 out of 10. That is probably correct if you are comparing it with Casablanca. If you judge it as an action film against other action films, I'd say it's probably more of a 7 out of 10. The following are the special features:<br /><br />Disc 1<br />* Commentary by Jan DeBont and Stefan Fangmeier<br />* Theatrical Trailers<br /><br />Disc 2<br />* Chasing the Storm: Twister Revisited<br />* The Making of Twister [HBO First Look Special]<br />* Anatomy of a Twister<br />* Nature Tech: Tornadoes [2003 History Channel special]<br />* Van Halen Humans Being Music Video

0743298039|5.0|Unless you have the time to sit and read this book, don't open it! I was up for two nights in a row until 3 in the morning because I couldn't depart from the story and it's characters! An exquisite read!

B000WO251Q|5.0|What a beautiful book!!! This is a masterpiece that will be read for generations to come; of that I am sure. No book has touched me in such a way before...no book has ever brought me so close to tears! In a way I am speechless and at a loss for words, for I honestly did not expect this book to be that great...and with no exaggeration, such a treasure.    This is my second Nicholas Sparks book. The first one I tried to read was `True Believer', but I gave up on it after about forty pages or so. I actually started reading it while on an airplane on my way to London, England. Maybe it was the rumbling sound of the aircraft engines; the low light; or maybe it was the low pressure. Either way, I was not captivated by the book for lack of concentration.     When I was recommended `Dear John' by my bookstore, I thought long and hard before buying it. I don't know what made me buy it. Was it the insistence of the bookseller, or maybe some other unknown benevolent force acting upon me? One thing is for sure: I am glad I read it, and thank God I was destined to.    This is a book you should definitely know nothing about prior to reading it. By that I mean don't read reviews or a summary of the book (except mine of course). Don't even read the back cover or the inside jacket. It is better you have no expectations or any idea what the story is about to really fully enjoy it.    What makes this book unique is its down-to-earth nature. The characters are real and you will easily fall in love with them. They actually come alive, and you will feel as if they are sitting right there with you in your living room (or wherever else you are reading). Not many books can succeed in this.     The reading is easy with no difficult vocabulary, making it easy to understand and follow. You are never at any point bogged down by difficult or unnecessary words. All the words seem to fit together snuggly, and you'll find yourself lost into the story.    What is love? Did any of us really experience love? Are we able to love the happiness of another more than our own? I usually don't read many fiction books for I never really learn much from them (at least from the latest books I have been reading). But this book taught me so much about myself that it was like looking through a mirror. `Hey', I said to myself, `What are you doing with your life? Go out and meet all the wonderful people out there full of love.' Yes, indeed, there are good people out there, and lately I have become withdrawn into my own little world. This book made me want to go out again into the world and meet the people who make a difference to others, and like them, to be motivated to make a difference to others as well. Such people exist. They are out there.     This book also made me love fiction again. One thing is for sure: not only will I reread `True Believer', I will check out all of Sparks' books. This writer is a magician with words.    I will also from now on try to give books I read more of a chance before giving up on them. Maybe instead of 40 pages I should read 80 before I give up. But give up I will, for I know there is somewhere another magical book waiting for me.    I loved this book because I related to it, and it seemed like it was written just for me. I also read it at the right time in my life and the right place, if you know what I mean. Should I say more?    I don't want to say too much for I don't want to ruin this book for you. Read it! The ending is one of the best in any fiction book I have read! If you feel tears fall down your face, don't be surprised; you are not the only one! And like so many other things in life, we never are alone!    ...and O, one more thing: all aspiring writers should read this book!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've tried several closed-ear headphones, as well as open-ear ones, and these are the best I've used by far. The sound is clear and crisp, while still rich and warm. I use them for recording once or twice a week; they're great monitor headphones as they don't bleed in to the mix at all. They're also very true for mixing, which is useful if you're like me and you can't have big studio monitors blaring when the kids go to bed.<br /><br />Overall, I'm totally happy with the performance and quality of these cans!
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Wow! This DVD blew me away.  It is really well done -- high quality video and sound.  Play this DVD with a good 5.1 stereo system and HDMI player and it is superb.      Of course, Celine is amazing as always. I would agree that her energy level is a bit lacking, but what can one expect after 4 years of doing (nearly) the same show over and over?  Actually, I didn't become a die-hard fan until AFTER I saw her show live in Las Vegas -- hearing her sing live is truly amazing.      Too bad Je T'aime Encore is not included on here, but I'm glad she at least sings the title song in the program because she didn't the two times I saw her live. I like the change to Frank Sinatra covers and my new favorite is her cover of Tina Turner's \\"River Deep, Mountain High\\" -- it just looks so effortless for her!  And wow, I never really thought of her as sexy, but she really holds her own in that Tina cover.      Definitely get this DVD even if you went to her concert, it's a great souvenir. And definitely get this DVD if you missed the chance to see her live in Las Vegas.  It's like bringing the concert to your home and having front row seats (and saving a $100 bucks or more).  Unfortunately, I had to pay double to get the DVD European version.  However, it was worth it anyway.  So it is a great deal at $16.99 on Amazon (at time of writing) and I am sure you will watch it over and over.  It's worth it! I already bought tix to her World Tour and hope she finds a way to even surpass her Las Vegas performances! This DVD is a must buy for all Celine fans!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I feel the movie Holiday is a beautiful story and one that truly gives anyone a feeling of happiness.  I purchased several as gifts this past Christmas.  It was the DVD that my 20 year old Grandaughter had at the top of her Christmas List.
B00005MM01|5.0|1968 was the year, when the double-album concept really was beginning to break though. The Beatles released their \\"White Album\\", Jimi Hendrix released \\"Electric Ladyland\\" and Donovan this album, which with a playing time of about sixty minutes today plays easily on a single CD.<br /><br />The original album was divided into two records which thematically were meant be to different in their approach. First record, which was released in some countries as a single album titled \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\", was a continuation of Donovan's \\"new\\" electric style with Mickey Most as his producer. When Donovan in like Dylan turned electric in 1966 with \\"Sunshine Superman\\" Most was his producer and their partnership continued throughout the sixties.<br /><br />Though record one is mostly with drums and electric backing it's really not a rock-record. And apart from \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\", \\"Mad John's Escape\\" and a few other tracks most songs would not stick out on record two which was more or less a return to the pure acoustic folk-style which Donovan had left in 1965. Record two \\"For Little Ones\\" could thematically seem like a childrens' album, and while some songs would work fine as childrens' songs others lyrically probably would not really work. Most, of course, is also credited as the producer of this record.<br /><br />As a whole the double album is a very pleasant and mostly quiet album featuring simply arranged melodic tunes among which only few stand out.<br /><br />On record one the before-mentioned \\"Wear Your Love Like Heaven\\" and \\"Mad John's Escape\\" are obvious favourites along with the quieter \\"Land of Doesn't Have to Be\\".<br /><br />On record two it may be harder to bring forward particular songs, but \\"The Tinker and the Crab\\" and the beautiful closing track \\"Epistle to Derroll\\" are among my favourites.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|This album seems to go back towards the sound of earlier DKM and I would reccomend this if you are a fan from way back when.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|If this soundtrack isn't nominated in some way, it will be a crime. This is one of the best, if not THE best soundtrack/music from a movie ever. I read the book years ago and it is one of those books that sticks with you. The movie is fantastic with great performances by all involved. Also, Hal Holbrook should definitely get a nod for best supporting actor. He's one of our country's finest actors and his performance in this movie is a treasure. Eddie Vedder has done an amazing job capturing the heart & soul of this movie in music. The songs are spare but shining. ALL the songs on this CD are good and it is a rare when that can be said. I especially like 'Rise', 'Society' and of course 'Hard Sun' I've listened to this CD over and over and it doesn't get old. The music is great regardless if you have seen the movie, but I think that seeing the movie just gives you so much more context to the songs. This is just a great CD. Buy it.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|As is typical with most recent Disney with the exception of Cars this film starts off strong then drags then picks up again in the end. Kids will love it and adults might become bored during the meat of the movie.
B0000DJZ9T|5.0|Not only is the music CD great, but the DVD packs quite the punch.  The only tiny thing that bugged me was how the CD didn't have every song off of the DVD, but I guess that's what makes the DVD that much better.  If you like Coldplay, but this DVD, you will not regret it.  Best $20 musical purchase I've made in a long time.
B000V7B90C|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you dig Family Jewels, you'll love this as a live addendum. If you don't get that last sentence, avoid this DVD set and go for AC/DC \\"No Bull\\" live, which is definitely the best w/ Brian show ever recorded and released. Gotta go, my Kilkenny is getting warm.
B000WQW988|5.0|If you like Nirvana at all, buy this DVD, you won't be disappointed...that's all I have to say.
0439796636|5.0|a simple short and well written story which is appealing to any age reader, if you enjoyed books like \\"all creatures great and small\\" or \\"charlottes web\\" you might enjoy it.  Contrast to \\"I am the Great Horse\\" another horse story but written creatively from Alexander the Great's Bucephelus' point of view, which  is more child like.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Well, I ordered this item very late at night, and I somehow ended up ordering two instead of one... by complete mistake. It turned out okay, because for Christmas I gave one to my daughter (5) and one to my nephew (7). Watching it with them makes me feel like a kid again. Okay, the movie is a little dark, a little creepy... but harmless enough for all ages. I remember being fixated by the musical numbers, and by that deep-voiced, man-eating plant when I was little. It's good to pass this movie on to a new generation. :)
B000002UTT|4.0|Great album. Roxette's first in the US.  Had a couple of hits that launched them internationally.
B000HCPU0Q|5.0|I like The Clash, because they rock all the time. I like a lot of their songs, including \\"Train In Vain\\", \\"Rock The Casbah\\", \\"Sex Mad Roar\\", \\"Lost In The Supermarket\\", and so forth. Those songs are pretty cool.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This Bourne is the best...it has something for everyone, male or female...lots of action, excitement, some romance & just a great movie to watch at home with someone special or a bunch of friends...a movie both my hiusband & I agreed upon!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Awesome DVD series.  Can't imagine that anyone would find this anything but incredible.  So interesting and beautifully documented! Got it for my husband (he's a National Geographic fanatic)as a Christmas gift but the whole family has enjoyed it.
0439882826|5.0|This was a real hit for Christmas gift.  It was a gift for my 7 year old grandson, who is a real Star Wars fan and he loved it.  There were so many pop-ups it was fun for all ages to discover them and the lighted sabres at the end was a fun surprise!  I bought 2 as gifts and will highly recommend to friends.
0765317389|5.0|Not only is this one of the greatest sci-fi novels of all time, it is also a primer on leadership, its concepts, and application. This gift version is beautifully executed and worth the 12 and change it costs on Amazon. A worthy addition to any library, home, corporate, or otherwise.
B000LGWZRO|1.0|This is only 1 watt and not as bright as stock Mag bulbs.  I have an Original Maglite LED upgrade and it is much better than the stock xenon/incadescent and 3x as bright as this off brand.  Either stay with the regular or buy the Maglite brand LED upgrade that is 3 watt vs. this 1 watt.  It costs twice as much to get the name brand but apparently you get what you pay for!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Excellent quality video and audio.  Great price, you can't get it anywhere cheaper than this, either.  If you love the Godfather then this is the set for you!
1554072840|1.0|The pictures are cute but what is the point if the potty doesnt look anything like one, it is a pot with a handle!  I have been reading it to my 21 month old daughter and I skip a lot of the pages.  Might be ok for older kids but I am not very impressed with this book.
0802130208|2.0|I read this for our book club- and it has been my least favorite book so far - felt like a complete waste of time - yes the story was at least interesting at parts - but overall felt like a waste of time.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|......really entertained us. I LOVE the movie. Can't praise it enough.  A must in any DVD collection.    Tina, Jersey City, NJ
B00006CXSS|5.0|My DVD came to my house in 3 days. It was exteremy fast delivery and the profudt was in perfect condition. It was still in its original wrapping like the seller stated. I will most def order from him again
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Flawless... great movie with lots of heart and a beautiful perspective.  Thoughtful story line that makes life hit home!  Enjoy!
073941335X|5.0|The finest piece of work I've read in 40 years. I, at first, had no idea what the author was talking about. Then the lightbulb turned on. It totally captivated me and had me in its thrall. I cannot compare it to Tolkein or LeGuin as it came from a totally unique perspective. Comparisons fail as to works of art. We only add our own perspectives and prejudices. As said in interviews with the author, this is a story of children moving from innocence to experience.
0143038419|5.0|it reads like she is speaking right to you....its well worth your time to sit and read this book!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan opened me and a number of my friends and family to a game that is easy to learn as monopoly or risk but ten times more enjoyable.   I had not been willing to play anything but card games for years.  This game incorporates strategy, chance, and negotiating skills (you must convince your opponents to trade resources with you even though it may mean that you will win the game).  The initial game only allows 3-4 players so most people will want to purchase the expansion pack which allows up to 6.  However, the 3-4 person games are usually shorter, allowing time for more than one game.  When teaching new players the game may take several hours to finish, especially as the number of players grows.  The game indicates that the age range is 10 and up.  I think this is about right.  We taught it to our 10 year old niece and she won the game.  Our 8 year old nephew needed to be teamed up with an adult (he loves playing the game though).  Once everyone gets the hang of the rules, a game can finish in an hour.  Definitely a great addition to low key, small group social gatherings.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I bought this for my dad, an aerospace engineer, and he loves it. A great gift for anyone interested in space, science, history, or who just loves a great story.
B000VR824S|4.0|Got it for my mom for Xmas and she had us put it in the DVD minutes after she opened it. She loves it !!! Great video quality on it too.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It doesn't matter who you are or where your interests lie. You will simply be blown away by the footage. The 1080p image quality is so incredible you just won't believe it when you see it. A friend already owned this on DVD and we watched a couple episodes before I bought the blu-ray version and we never touched the DVD version again. This series was made for the visuals and everyone I've shown this to has been impressed. Plus, you also learn some stuff along the way.  See how many other 5 star reviews there are and know you can't go wrong with this purchase.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|This is a beautifully packaged CD. I bought it to replace may original copy of The Joshua Tree, but it is so nice that I will put it aside as a keepsake, and buy another copy to use. I love that it is remastered and the sound is cleaner.    The book is really nice with photos by Anton Corbjin who has photographed the band from the beginning. You will find his photos in the books U2byU2, and U2 and I. There are also some photo cards that are a nice addition to the set.    The bonus DVD is something that you would not get elsewhere, and the concert is one of the best ever. As a longtime fan of U2 this is an exciting addition to my collection of collectables and the band has once again given us more of them to appreciate!
B000065BPB|4.0|Yeah, they're big. They're kind of ugly. And initially, they might even be uncomfortable. But if you are spending more then $50 on headphones, sound quality is what you care about the most and for this price, you can't get any better.   A long time ago I used some Sony earbuds that simply boosted the lower freqs and I thought those sounded good. Then I switched to these and now I can't believe how ignorant I used to be. I can now wear them for extend periods of time without any discomfort, even when I wear my glasses. Since the cups seal around your ear, some outside noises are blocked.  If you are unsure about making the leap from stock headphones to quality headphones, this is a great buy without breaking the bank.
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Kanye is doing it big like always, this album is great and delivers hot tracks all throughout!
031286504X|4.0|I enjoy \\"end time(s)\\" stories and this is a particularly good one written in 1954 by Richard Matheson.  I have seen the movie \\"I Am Legend\\" (2007) and an earlier movie version of Matheson's story, \\"The Omega Man\\", starring Charlton Heston (1971).  I think I prefer the written word, in this case, to either of the Hollywood renditions.<br /><br />I think Will Smith and Charlton Heston deliver outstanding performances in their respective movies and some of the cinematography in \\"I Am Legend\\" is striking with views of a deserted Manhattan replete with empty cars and stores, vegetation growing in the once bustling streets and wildlife roaming free in what was once one of our world's greatest cities. Regardless, the world that Matheson conjured for me with words on paper is hard to best even with all the skills of modern film making.<br /><br />In this case, I don't know if my preference for the written word would be shared of others. Perhaps the problem for me is that the scope of these kinds of stories and their implications for the human species is so broad that even good writers, directors, and actors and modern cinematography have difficulty delivering the story with the same impact that words on a page, coupled with one's imagination, can produce.<br /><br />A counter example, for me, is Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films  based on J.R. Tolkien's marvelous three-volume triology of the same name. In that case, I was delighted to find that the actors and Mr. Jackson were up to the task - and what a task it was.<br /><br />Endings to stories or movies can always be discussed and debated, of course, so my personal opinion is that the ending of Richard Matheson's story and the ending of \\"The Omega Man\\" are better than the ending of \\"I Am Legend\\".<br /><br />I would recommend this story (and both movies) to anyone who likes stories of survival set in end times or post-end times.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|Wow, I am listening to this cd right now and it is very relaxing. It is a great CD to listen to. it will calm your senses and at the end of a busy loud day. Put you feet up, turn the lights down low, open the window if it raining, otherwise close the blinds and grab your favor drink and lay back and close your eyes and just listen...your blood pressure will drop like rain in a puddle...mmmmmmmm.
B000VAQX0A|5.0|Permanent Waves has arrived (mine is stamped with #00398 in gold lettering - sweet!) and has gone through the process - A/B-ing with the 1997 remaster and original CD release - and the conclusion is what I expected. Audio nirvana. The latest Mobile Fidelity offering blows away any previous CD version of Permanent Waves, plain and simple. The soundstage is much, much wider and fuller, the sound is clean and crystal clear. I won't say it's a new album in the hands of MoFi - it's simply the album as it should have been long ago. Why does it take these guys to make music sound the way it should?<br /><br />As for that new packaging style, the mini-LP replica style, it's beautiful. I'll always miss the cool and smart Lift-Lock cases, but these mini-LP replicas are very nice. But . . . and unfortunately there has to be a \\"but\\" . . . for some very strange reason, while Mobile Fidelity focuses so much time and energy recreating the original packaging, with nice, sharp (if a bit dark) images used for the cover and all photos, they really fudged it when it comes to the lyrics book cover, which is the same as the album cover. Instead of being the same crisp, sharp image, it is a murky, blurry, off-color red - yet all the text is perfectly clear, meaning they actually chose a blurry picture (it's not a bad print job). Truly baffling - but it's relatively minor when everything else is so nice.<br /><br />Six stars for the music and remastering, one star deducted for the fumbled image choice. We're paying nearly $30 for these things - we deserve *everything* to be top-notch. They very nearly got it. Hopefully this won't occur in the 2112, Moving Pictures, and Signals MoFi reissues that will be coming out over the next year or so.
0446577391|1.0|Having read many of Mr. Baldacci's books, I had looked forward to Stone Cold.  Most reviews were very positive.  I was very disappointed as the characters have become very uninteresting and repetitive.  Does anyone really care that Jerry Bagger is chasing the same woman for revenge?  This is a group of has beens.  I hope Mr. Baldacci moves on to another theme.
B00005JPXY|1.0|Whatever you do, don't believe the hype.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is a truly terrible movie, a piece of absolute garbage.  The only reason I gave it one star is that Amazon's rating scale doesn't allow you to give negative (as in below zero) ratings.    The worst part of the movie is the cinematography.  \\"Cloverfield\\" is shot documentary-style through the point of view of some guy with a video camera.  Not only does it make it impossible to see much of anything clearly, but the camera jerks around so much that it will give motion sickness to even those with the strongest of stomachs.  Whoever thought that such an approach was a good idea was horribly, horribly mistaken.    Even if they had used \\"normal\\" cinematography, the plot is non-existent.  People bash the 1998 Matthew Broderick version of \\"Godzilla\\" all the time, but at least there was some semblance of a plot and some sort of explanation for why the monster existed at all.  \\"Cloverfield\\" offers none of that.  Worse still, there is no attachment between the viewer and the characters--you don't care whether they survive or not, and you know they won't from the very way the movie opens.    All through the movie, I kept thinking, \\"Maybe the monster itself will be cool.\\"  Wrong.  It takes forever for them to show a good shot of it, and when they do, even that is a major disappointment.  All in all, I wish I could recover the money and the hour and a half of my life that I wasted on this movie.
0571202284|5.0|This is te best animation resource I´ve ever seen. Specially if you are a  beginner in this area. You must see this.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This is a movie, I grew up with.  To me, Christmas is not complete until I see this movie.  It is now a tradition in my family.  To get the family together and see this movie each and every Christmas.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Cute extra features (especially for the little girls that like to sing and dance along). Also nice section on Aileen Quinn all grown up.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|This is a fantastic DVD and CD.  Friends who have been over to see it also agree.  Would recommend if you like Michael Buble.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|Love it. Think it is the best movie of the year, but i am bias I love sci-fi, action movies. But for sure, the soundtrack is the best...the highest of the high of musician composers. great cast as well!
0783226063|5.0|GREAT movie with really good actors. Some have gone on to superstardom. Rate this movie as 5 stars!
B000VLE3IS|5.0|My boyfriend loves this new album, he was excited there were live performances on the DVD he has never seen before (he's seen every other Zeppelin DVD up til now)
B00003CXAA|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXAA The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)]]    I ordered this product 3 weeks before christmas, and it still arrived in the 9 days I was promised.  Upon arrival, it was in perfect condition and wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. If it had ever been used, I would not have known.
B000UR9TPK|4.0|Their are plenty of reviews discussing the content of the film / concert.  My review is specifically intended to address the transfer of this film to Blu-Ray.  The source signal (at least on my copy) indicates a 1080i transfer (not 1080p).  Still, this is the best available version of this package to date.  Film is grainy in outdoor sequences, however concert footage is more than acceptable when considering the source material is over 30 years old.  Purchased this copy over the Best Buy website in December '07.  As other reviewers point out, it has since been discontinued in this particualar format and re-release timing TBD.
0743486285|5.0|I pre-ordered this book months before it came out.  It is probably the best autobiography I have ever read. I could hardly put it down. The book puts you through a whirlwind of emotions and you almost feel like your right there with Nikki as he's taking you along the ride of his life. I've also read the Dirt (about Motley Crue). The Heroine Diaries is a whole differnt level. The Heroine Diaries is a heart wrenching story about a troubled sole and his struggle to get his sole back...definately worth reading.
0307346617|4.0|I have a theory about movies.  You can't go wrong with films about junkies (Drugstore Cowboy, Trainspotting, Sid and Nancy, etc.), Nazis (Boys from Brazil, Marathon Man, etc.) or Zombies (Night of the Living Dead, Return of the Living Dead, Shaun of the Dead, Fido).  It seems that my theory holds up with books, too, at least as far as Zombie books go.  Max Brooks did a great job of compiling \\"reports\\" of survivors of the Zombie War If you enjoyed any of the above-listed zombie movies, you will find World War Z to be a treat.  I haven't had the opportunity to check out Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide yet but I do look forward to it.  World War Z is definitely worth checking out.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I went to see the play and wanted a reminder of it.  The CD is a word for word rendition of the play and is awesome.  I am so glad that I bought it.  I have given it as a gift because the songs are so amazing that I wanted to share it with friends.  I definitely recommend it!
B000K15VSA|5.0|Excellent! A must for any Blade Runner FAN! Lots of little tidbits here & there!
B000EWBKKI|4.0|I gave 4 starts because I liked the movie, but the quality of the images is not impressive, maybe because is an old film and the master wont be in HD. but definitely is an awesome movie, nice presentation/introduction.
0967175429|5.0|I have recently taken the course in Theta Healing and find this book very good to help with information regarding belief work.  This is easy to do on yourself and is very enlightening to see via muscle testing a form of kinesiology.  I found that even though mentally i believed i was good enough my body told me i held beliefs opposite to this which was why I was not moving forward.  Also i carried beliefs from past lives which were affecting me in this life.  I would recommend this to anyone seriously willing to look at and change their belief patterns.  Excellant book and guide, worth a read for healers and people already working on their beliefs.  People with no realisation in their beliefs will also find it interesting information.
B000GGSMF8|1.0|If you liked the first album, you won't necessarily like this one. Be warned. A classic case of unimaginative second album syndrome here. The whole trick with any album of cocktail lounge covers of punk/new wave/new romantic/etc classics lies in choosing the right songs - ideally the more unlikely songs for such a makeover. Nouvelle Vague's first album - not this one - got this perfect. This one, however, seems like it has been put together in a Help!, what do we choose now panic. Full of already drippy songs like Fade To Grey and Dance With Me, or tracks - eg Ever Fallen In Love -where the original is so much better that one wonders why they bothered. Finally, every song sounds rather too samey, which was not true of brilliant album number one.
0143038583|5.0|It's a phrase that gets used too way often but this is the kind of book that can change your life. In the last year I have lost almost 50 pounds (BEFORE I started reading this book) and discovered just how profound an impact diet can make on your body. Not diet as in restricting carbs or loading up on proteins but diet as in being in tune with what you are eating. The Omnivores Dilemma isn't about losing weight, it's about having an awareness and appreciation for what's going into your body and an appreciation for the wondrous biological process that nature goes through to produce edible substances.<br /><br />One central question the author addresses is whether or not we as individuals actually save money by buying cheap food and what is the economic, environmental and health impact of having an increasingly monocultural diet of corn. Why is food that's bad for us so cheap? Because it's subsidized by the government. The author points out that the expanding waistlines of American's really took off when cola's switched from natural sugar to high fructose corn syrup. In fact corn syrup is nearly impossible to avoid. But it's not just what we buy at supermarkets. Mr. Pollan shows how the average meal at McDonald's is 50% or more corn after the corn is processed beyond recognition.<br /><br />One chapter that really stuck with me was the authors take on the idea that meat is murder. He carefully and respectfully refutes each of the points made by vegetarians on why eating meat is unethical. In the end I have personally settled on the same compromise as the author which is that eating meat is fine. The problem is when we pay no attention to the quality of life of the animals we consume. Unfortunately, there tends to be a near total disassociation in the minds of urban consumers between the meat and the animal. I am willing to pay a premium to get beef from cows that are grass fed and free of antibiotics and hormones. An ethical meat eater owes it to the animals he consumes to do at least a minimal amount of research on how they are treated. Personally I haven't eaten fast food since February 2007. I pay several dollars more per pound to buy beef at Whole Foods and I still probably have room for improvement. The next step would be to give our local farmers market a try.<br /><br />The changes I've made in my life include avoiding fast food look the plague, staying away from high fructose corn syrup specifically and generally paying attention to the label when I buy products. If a product has ingredients I can't identify like Xanthan Gum or Maltodextrin I put it back on the shelf. I also try and avoid products that use pesticides, antibiotics or hormones. It has made an enormous impact on my health.<br /><br />Omnivores Dilemma is a powerful book but it never feels preachy and although the author moves around to quite a few different topics never feels unfocused. This is one of those books that makes me wish I hadn't given out so many five stars because this one deserve six. There is a reason Michael Pollan currently has two books in the top 20 on Amazon.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|I really enjoyed the first and second seasons of veronica mars.  Expertly written, casted, and developed.  Kristen Bell is wonderful.  She carried the series well and I look forward to seeing the third season.  I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't get bored. I'm glad it went to dvd.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|\\"MARK IT ZERO\\", screams a gun toting Walter to his bowling opponent, who Walter claims stepped over the line by mere centimeters. Begrudgingly, the \\"zero\\" is marked down and Walter, very calmly & innocently, puts his gun away and says, \\"It's a league game\\", with a complete belief and justification for his over the top action.    This is the theme of the very funny film, \\"The Big Lebowski\\". It's an over the top film where bad guys pee on rugs, innocent people get faces shoved in toilets, women have their pinky toe (with green nail polish) cut off, where a pederast named Jesus tries to win a bowling title, Sam Elliot is the narrator, and Donny is always told to \\"shut the f*ck up\\".    The Coen Brothers are to thank for this huge cult hit. Their star, the dude, is quite possibly the laziest man in the world and is desperately trying to be reimbursed for his pee soaked rug. He is then thrown into a world of 2nd rate porn, fake kidnappings, nihilist, dinky biting marmots, Walter's constant Vietnam War rants, and an eccentric painter wanting his baby. It's no wonder the dude's diet mostly consists of white Russians and marijuana.    All the characters are memorable and gel excellently with one another, despite their major flaws and idiosyncrasies. Props to John Goodman and Jeff Bridges for their portrayals of Walter and the Dude. They made a great match together with their constant bickering and flinging of F bombs. Also to John Tuturro for being on screen less than five minutes, yet capturing one of the most funny and memorable character in a long while.    I was expecting more from the DVD, such as behind the scenes, or a directors/actors commentary. None of that was included. Hopefully one day, but in the meantime it's a pleasure to sit back and watch this funny film over and over.     Sommer Shabbos!!!!!
B00005JPXY|2.0|I have to say I wanted to like this movie. Since I saw the first trailers last summer this has been on my \\"must see\\" list. The viral marketing was interesting and I really thought this would be an incredible hit. Unfortunately, it just doesn't fly like it should have.<br /><br />Yes, the idea of a movie shot entirely from someone's video camera is a good one...but then you reach those points in the movie when you know there's no way on earth you'd sit there and keep filming while this stuff was going on. Any normal person would drop the camera and run for their lives. And yes, the monster was unique, I'll give points for that. But the point of going to a movie like this is to find out some simple answers: where did the monster come from? Why did it choose New York? What made it attack? These are the questions you START the movie with. They are the same questions you'll END the movie with. The movie ends with such abruptness you'd think the director just said, \\"Ok, that's the budget, let's go home.\\"<br /><br />There are good qualities too. The movie is genuinely suspenseful at times. The jerky camera movements can give you a headache after a while, but it really gives authenticity to the experience. You feel like you're a part of a real disaster occurring around you. Still, the ending just ruins the movie for me. I felt like I'd watched an episode of a great television show, and I'd be hyped for next week's episode...except there isn't one coming. Makes me a little leery about how Lost is going to end now.<br /><br />See it if you'd like, but don't expect perfection.
B00028HBKM|5.0|This is easily the most violent and graphically stunning movie I've ever seen.  I'd bet that it's not likely to be topped by anything anytime soon.  Not from horror.  Not from dark fantasy.  Not from sci-fi.  No, this one will pledge it's vision into my skull for a long time even if I never watch it again.    The \\"Passion\\" is probably partly based on less extreme Passion plays that are featured around the world as a commemoration of Christ's death.  It is clear, though, that Gibson went for the throat with this film.  There is no question here.  You either sympathize with the devastated Christ or you have no soul.  That's the message of this film.  The plight of Judas Iscariot is no less powerful than that of his Master becoming the victim of circumstances that he could not forsee in his greed and power hungry heart.      The fleshed out depictions of the spiritual forces of evil add a wickedness to the story that draws a clear disinction between Christ and the great Accuser, Satan, who is played by a woman to give the ancient rival of God a clearly feminine cast.  Not sure why Gibson felt that was necessary, but it is visually stunning.    The beating of Christ, however, is the most gruesome feature of this film.  No one below the age of 17 should be allowed to see it.  It is so real and cruel that it makes one wonder if the human race is worth saving at all, if it cannot do any better than this.  The wounds are horrid.  The blood is all too convincing.      After this, the crucifixion is almost anti-climatic.  Almost.  Gibson manages to stage the culmination of the story with gruesome and dour aplomb.  He manages to make Christ seem and feel real against any doubt that might capture the heart.  Excellently acted and directed this movie is one for the ages.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I received this as a Christmas gift, and I'd have to say it's one of the best gifts I received. At a time when so much of the new music being produced is either boring, derivative, or just plain non-musical, this was a refreshing surprise.<br /><br />I hear traces of Alan Parsons Project with a smattering of Renaissance and even Polyphonic Spree; but in no way is it a direct emulation of any of them. The styles of the tracks drift from rock to jazz to folk, with even a fairly strong Phillip Glass influence to many of the compositions. In other words, this album is hard to put into any specific classification, which no doubt will limit its sales, sad to say.<br /><br />If all that wasn't good enough, the album is available on vinyl (which is the version I have).

B00005JPXY|5.0|First and foremost, the buzz created by Cloverfield is well deserved.  There will be people who dislike the acting, cliffhangers, or even the filming techniques.  What can't be denied, however, is the epic nature of this movie, and the way in which the viewer is drawn into the chaos.<br /><br />Cloverfield starts off with the beginnings of a surprise party for Rob Hawkins (Michael Stahl-David).  Everyone is getting together in his swanky Manhattan loft to see him on his way to a new career opportunity in Japan.  His friend Lily (Jessica Lucas) and his brother Jason (Mike Vogel) are playing hosts, and it is a joyous event throughout.  Then Rob's love interest Beth (Odette Yustman) shows up with a date.<br /><br />The party continues on, but it's clear that Rob is not himself.  It's evident because the film's humor source, Hud (TJ Miller), is filming every detail of every guest, and happens to catch a fight between Rob and Beth.  Aside from that, Hud keeps gravitating towards Marlena (Lizzy Caplan), a girl in which he's extremely interested.  They have evidently met several times before, but Marlena doesn't remember Hud, and definitely doesn't want anything to do with his company or the camera.<br /><br />And then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Manhattan shakes.  The ground rumbles, and the tremors are palpable throughout the city.  Lights go off, screams ring through the air, and it's too close not to remember the events of 9/11.  The residents are frightened out of their minds.  Despite initial reports of an earthquake, in no time at all, we learn that not only are the massive sounds and tremors not earthquakes, but instead they are the ear-splitting footsteps of some gigantic monster attacking the city, destroying everything in its path.<br /><br />The party-goers dash for the street, where they see fireballs, massive chunks of buildings being ripped from hinges, and the Statue of Liberty's head come flying down the street like the view from pins at giant's bowling alley.<br /><br />An epic battle ensues in which the group goes into the heart of the battle, as Rob, Lily, Hud, and Marlena go to find Beth, who left for her apartment after the fight.  They brave the unknown, monsters that are beyond imagination, and darkness through which nothing but fear can be felt.  Drawing perfectly upon fear of the unknown and the loss of sense and perception, the group makes and incredibly dangerous and scary decision to travel through the shutdown, blacked-out subway tunnels.  As they're making their way through the city, they are caught in the middle of heavy fire; the military has brought countless troops, artillery, rocket launchers, and jets to saturate the monster's surroundings with bombs.  It becomes clear in no time that the military is losing the battle.<br /><br />The true genius of this movie is in its concept from beginning to end.  The buzz leads to the anticipation; the usage of a handheld camera for the entire movie's filming style leads to the realistic chaos.  In fact, the shaky, spastic, sometimes confusing camera shots are perhaps the movie's strength and weakness at the same time.  While lending towards credibility, it leaves the audience wanting to see more, changing a point of view for the hopes of a split second's more viewing time.  I wanted to scream a Hud - despite his diligence - to focus a bit more on the action, to ignore the fear for even a split second so I could see the monster and the destruction.  The panic and fear are both understandable and realistic.<br /><br />The ending leads to a desire for more.  The viewer is left wanting, needing to find a more complete resolution.  Perhaps 50 people waited through the entire list of credits for a hope of an extra scene, maybe a hint about the actual ending, even the slightest bit more information.  Don't be fooled into thinking this is just another monster movie, or a cheesy Godzilla movie shot through a handheld camera.  It's incredibly intense and providesshock, suspense, fear, and surprise around every corner.  It's wonderfully mysterious, completely original, and sets a new standard for the horror movie genre.wonderfully mysterious, completely original, and sets a new standard for the horror movie genre.
0062515675|4.0|This was one book I judged by its title. I found it gimmicky so resisted reading it for a long time. In retrospect, I should have read it much earlier.     The book lays out its 7 principles using a silly but effective fable that is easily remembered. The principles are:    1. A magnificent garden that signifies our mind.  2. The lighthouse is a representation of the purpose of our life.  3. The Sumo wrestler stands for Kaizen, the continuous and never ending improvement that we must bring into our lives.  4. Pink wire cable denotes the discipline that's required to be successful.  5. The stopwatch represents time and how it is the most important commodity.  6. Fragrance of fresh yellow roses signifies the service we must do unto others.  7. A bright diamond studded path represents enlightened living.    Read the book to see how these 7 principles fit in a mythical funny fable. [...] has the summary of the book.
B0000VCZK2|3.0|When I ordered this movie set, it was listed as HD DVD. When recieved, nowhere did it make ANY reference to HD. Upon checking out why not, I found it no longer listed on my order info as HD, although my packing slip DID say HD DVD. It turns out it is NOT available (at this time, anyway) in HD, although, at last check through the HD movie list on Amazon, it was still to be found there. If you search for it by name, though, there is no match. Appears to be a major misunderstanding, but they seem to be trying to re-list it. The set I kept, anyway. Aside from the HD bit, it is an exceptional movie set.

B000VAQX0A|1.0|Same old classic record company gimmick, re-release an already fine sounding cd/album and call it \\"Remastered\\" and \\"Better sounding then Eva!!\\", while charging it for a downright stupid price for a single CD. I don't know if this is band approved (i doubt it), but it looks like filthy rich record companies have no qaulms about milking fans into buying CD's they already own. I guess when the money stops flowing from from bands back catalogs they have to start pulling stunts like this...<br /><br />I don't think Rush would do this to their fans, I bet this thing isn't even band approved, official licenced, therfore Geddy and the boys get screwd out of hard earned balloons.<br /><br />Don't buy this sad attempt at a record executive ca$h grab.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|GREAT movie!!!!  Very realistic animation.  The cars in the movie each had their own realistic human traits that made the whole movie a delight to watch over and over.  The music they used for the soundtrack was perfect especially the Rascal Flats version of \\"Life is a Highway\\".    There are also extra things to do on the DVD and you get a \\"cast\\" list of all the cars in the movie too.  Very good movie.
B00004W3L3|5.0|What can I say, this is a must own album by fans of Neo-Prog. Basically anything by Marillion from the Fish era is outstanding, but to me, Misplaced Childhood is where they truly found their stride and began to take their place as a mature band. This is Marillion at the top of their game.
0143038419|2.0|I was curious but put off by the bad reviews of the book. It was on sale at Borders and decided to take the plunge. What hurt could it do?    Well, the first several chapters made me want to throw the book across the room. It read like a bad chick lit book (no offense who enjoy chick lit, but it's not my cup of tea). The author was frighteningly self-absorbed and selfish. I was counting off the pages to 50 to see if it would get better, because I was very close to dropping it off somewhere for someone else to read for free.    I found the author's voice to be easy and the book really readable. And I'm glad she found happiness. But it seems like she wants to do too much--she wants to eat good food, find spiritual enlightenment and love. Too many directions and not enough focus. I was hoping it would be more of a travelogue instead of a me-logue, but no such luck.    I noted with interest that she has another book coming out in 2009. Let's up it's more toned down and less \\"me-me-me\\".

B000WTNCQS|5.0|Outstanding...  My love of U2 began when Joshua Tree was first released 20 years ago.  This collection would be worth it just for the romance and the memories.  However, all the bonus materials make it outstanding.  The bonus CD has previously unreleased tracks (some which you can kind of see why they were hidden so long, but the rest are wonderful).  And the bonus DVD has some fantastic behind the scenes material and a full length concert that really does act as a snap shot of where the band was in that moment in time.  If you can cough up the change... this is a great collection to have.

1586210661|5.0|Hearing Sedaris read his own work-Me Talk Pretty One Day-has caused me to appear like a laughing lunatic in my car, alone, as I drive to work. While I understand why his extremely dry and sarcastic take on the world might not appeal to everyone, if you find every day life a great combination of unbelievable, tragic and really funny, you will love this guy. Although I read this book several years ago and loved it, someone suggested I listen to the CD as it features Sedaris reading his own work, with the emphasis and pauses where he meant them to be. His voice itself is funny, too. If you aren't sure about buying the CD (or book) I suggest going to the website for NPR, (National Public Radio), searching the archives for him and listening to one or two pieces for free. You will be hooked. I love, love, love the pieces where he is in France with his lover Hugh, because he is very honest about being an outsider. The stuff about his family-well, if it is half-true, I'm glad he can earn a living after that crazy upbringing. There are some bonus pieces he reads to a live audience that aren't in the book, I think. I am a huge fan, and as a New York City resident, may appreciate some of his city-based stories about him starting out here more than others. Sedaris' voice creates an intimacy with the listener. I am buying this for a really sick relative who has a wicked sense of humor, because it is so funny that it could serve as medicine.

B0009DBXXG|5.0|Well,  not really. But this documentary comes as close to it as any documentary I've seen. You see and hear it all: preliminary rehearsals, takes and retakes, instructions to the orchestra, frustration, pleasure, triumph, take out food, the works. And some glorious glorious music. The final take of \\"One Hand, One Heart\\" is astounding: benevolent Lenny conducts, Carreras conducts himself, Te Kanawa beaming at Carreras, and pulling herself out at the end, and the wonderful sound of their two voices. The middle, orchestral part, is marred by a voice-over from Bernstein, but you learn to ignore it. And that's only the BEST sequence on tape. There's lots more. \\"Officer Krupke\\" is a lot fun, as the singers act and gesture in role (some even have 50s-style letter jackets). \\"Maria\\" is superb, after Carreras  recovers from a frustrating session where he walked out of the studio in anger. Bernstein chews out someone for not getting his annotations marked on the parts, praises the first trumpet player, throws shoulder moves on the orchestra. And so forth. Get it, now.

0446577391|5.0|The members of the Camel Club are sleuths who detest government treachery.  They center their quest on the touchstone of truth.  This latest installment is the authors best accomplishment with these characters yet.  The book is fast paced with new, well developed characters.  Their nemesis, Carter Grey is at his reviling best in this book.  The reader believes he is at the limits of hating Carter, when one page over the hate surges to a new level.  The cunning the author crafted in this book is excellent.  Here's to hoping for more of the crafty Camel Club.
B00005JPXY|5.0|first of all, i wouldn't suggest anyone watch the movie solely to find out what the creature is and how it operates. that's not what this movie is about. the story is about a group of people who try to escape a city that is under attack. **SPOILER ALERT** while you do see the creature, up close and personal, you basically are a member of the DOD who is watching the video left by one of the partygoers. **END OF SPOILER** This movie is not a horror movie, per se, but an exercise in terror. you are meant to feel what it is like trying to get out of the city, and darn whatever that thing is that the military is shooting.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Ive never cared for CSI, Sopranos, Saw, Hostel, or any other show that used violence, blood, & gore as a draw for an audience.  However, I can accept violence, and some blood/gore if there is a mystery, good story, or lesson behind it.<br /><br />The original Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Silence of the Lambs, and their real life counterparts like Herman Mudgett, Zodiac, and Ed Gein has always been interesting for the real life nightmare stories they tell us.  Lizzie Borden & Charles Whitman are also good examples as mystery stories go but they were not serial killers. Real life horror stories so to speak.<br /><br />I really liked \\"Six Feet Under\\", and thought that anything with Michael C. Hall would be great-but I was a bit hesitant about watching a show with so much blood & gore in it.  I WAS WRONG!  Turns out that the blood & gore is very much a background element, and the stories never use the violence as a draw for an audience as I first thought.  Instead it uses the violence to show us that good things \\"sometimes\\" come from it.  It is a show full of twists and turns.<br /><br />I liked the show right away, but not until the real \\"Ice Truck Killer\\" was revealed- with Eric Carmens' \\"Lose Control\\" playing as background music was I really hooked.  Im not finished with the first season yet, but its hard not to watch the whole series from start to finish in one sitting. Its interesting to note that Tony Goldwyn is one of the directors of this show.  I remember him best from \\"Ghost\\" as the friend of Patrick Swayze.  Mr Goldwyn plays psychiatrist to Dexter here and meets a similar fate.<br /><br />This show is not for kids under 18. Looking forward to season 2.

B000G8NXYG|5.0|Any brief review of an incredible movie experience risks, at best,  sounding trite; or, like a fan's enthusiastic ravings, unintelligible to the individual not familiar with Japanese culture and history, Japanese cinema, the Samurai film genre, the actors (especially Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura), and Akira Kurosawa's direction. I can only suggest reading about these topics first if you are a total novice (or comparatively so), then buy this DVD edition, then read the booklet & essays, then watch the movie and get blown away. If you have any qualms about the running time, don't give it another moment's thought. Not one minute is wasted, like reading a great book you can't put down.

B000MQC9H4|5.0|LOOOOOVED this film - absolutely loved it ... everyone was cast superbly well with a beautiful rendition of the lives of two separate couples on two separate countries was AB FAB.  Loved all the British sayings and acronyms used and how they perfectly fit in the story - as well as the development of the characters and how well their stories flowed and intertwined...      Two stories that are parallel and depict two separate triumphs of the heart after terrible circumstances that have left some of the characters more than bruised and scathingly hurt with a less than a favorable light toward romance - There are so many schmucks out there - of the male and female form that when people come together despite their cultural experiences and the miles that separate them it is wonderful to see their stories flower and blossom.   Not just a chick flick - as my guy loved it and thought that it was a funny and touching story - I loved the character development and the idyllic locations - the cottage in Surrey is magical and ethereal in its winter splendor (and yes, it is really like that in England as I have stayed in a place just like it in Brighton!!) and Amanda's lavish Beverly Hills home is to die for ... Jack Black is absolutely funny and just as gorgeous as Jude Law (yum!).  I adored Elli Wallach's role as the retired and elderly film producer - and all the mention of old movies - which is what Hollywood was all about.. Like Barbara Stanwyck in The Lady Eve!!!  Wallach is one of my all time favorite western dudes - in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly!!!  All in all - a marvelous film and one that has quickly become one of my favorites to date!

B000K15VSA|4.0|The ultimate Bladerunner DVD set is a good purchase for the serious fan. Addressing all the extra collectibles that come with it, I think it is worth the $30 jump in price from the 4-Disc version. I only saw a description of those elements beyond the 5 discs listed recently. The briefcase is an entertaining piece of packaging and I admit to being very fond of the models of the car and orgami unicorn. The interior of the case is well organised and configured. The setup is attratcive enough that I have had no desire to even remove the hologram block or the screencards from the compartment. That being said, this is really only meant for the obsessive fan and understandable why it is a limited edition. For 90% of the people considering purchasing Bladerunner, they should just stick to the 4 Disc set.<br /><br />As to the film, the final cut print is quite exquisite and very satisfying. The technical changes they made are very well done and in a much more organic way then say some of the new effects in the updated Star Wars trilogy. I will say that having 5 versions of the film gets to be a bit too much. However the bonus features are where I think the real strength lies. The 3.5 hour documentary on the film's history is totally comprehensive and enthralling. It's structured into multiple parts and has a good narrative format that evokes the movie to a certain degree. Almost all the major members of cast and production are interviewed. The interviews are highly informative and revealing. There is a willingness by all to be honest and discuss the problems and the uglier aspects of the film's history before, during and after its production. People are candid without being incindiery or insulting. The doc is so insightful that a fair amount of the audio commentaries seem redundant or unnecessary. And there are at least 3 of them.<br /><br />The more technical based features dealing with the film production are very educational and well documented without being bloated or too long to make you lose interest. This is a problem I find with DVDs covering more recent special effects movies. They include a rare radio interview with the late Philip K Dick that is a pleasure to hear. They also address the issue of the book vs the movie and the question about Deckard and this is also done honestly with plenty of disagreement.<br /><br />Any other issues I have with the DVD set up is minor. I would have preferred a little user friendly setup on the arrangement of the bonuses and the activation of commentaries. Also the flickering camera grid gets annoying after a while. Been nice if they were not on every menu.ou lose interest. This is a problem I find with DVDs covering more recent special effects movies.

I feel that 'The rising' and \\"devils & dust' are two of his 'best' CDs but this CD, 'Magic', is too much E-Street Deja Vu and not enough of his superior narrative songs-stories. There are, however, several really good cuts on the album.So get it.
0486237664|5.0|A present for my daughter-in-law and the illustrations were incredible.  She is an artist and will make good use of this book.
1401300529|4.0|Very good, but some annoying gaffes. In what Army, in what war, was \\"L\\" company ever called \\"Love\\" company? Or \\"H\\" company called \\"Hope\\" company? LIMA! HOTEL! C'mon, people, get a little closer to your subject. Also, in the glossary up front, the weapons list includes a \\"4.2mm\\" mortar. Shoots BB's, maybe?
160024131X|5.0|Outstanding audio book and unbelievable recount of daring expedition by Redwing! Story just mesmerizes you and holds your attention! You want to stay in your car and finish the book!!    Unbelievable!! Would recommend to anyone and dramatic story of what our brave men are going through!!
1594489505|5.0|The characters in the book really resonated with me.  Reading about women in Afghanistan was eye opening, but at the same time I could see how people are the same all over the world.  The writing is wonderful, I can't wait for his next book to come out.
B000W9DTG6|4.0|These movies aren't oscar worthy but they are entertaining.  I gave this to my husband for Christmas and he loved it.  We've watched them individually and had an Ocean's marathon.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|These dvd's are GREAT! A bargin at less than $20 to see EVERYTHING about the show.. As well as THE entire Las Vegas show. You will not be dissapointed....
B000MRAAJM|5.0|If you are going to purchase this compilation it HAS to be High Definition (Blu-ray or HD-DVD) and watch it in a nice high definition television. The visuals are awe-inspiring and the repeated use of extreme long-shots from the air and the beautiful satellite shots can only be properly enjoyed in HD. Apart from the visuals the documentary is structured to explain some of the most interesting characteristics of some of earth's eco-systems with sumptuous detail and elegant and clear narration. If you like nature at all, buy this, and if you don't buy it anyway and you will at least discover the wonder that is our planet.
0439882826|5.0|My sons and I got this for my husband for Christmas. They ALL love it. It is very cool. There are multiple pop ups on each page and they are very intricate and very cool. The light up light sabers at the end are an added bonus. My kids like to look through this book everyday and my husband finds it equally enjoyable.
B000R6PKP2|5.0|The quality of the transfer is perfect. They did not add any grain to emulate the film look and even though is IS film the image is ultra clean and beautiful. The small edits to the film and lots of extras make this the best version ever for the perfect sci-fi movie.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Best acting by all, throughout; no nonsense, no special effects, no violence, no blood or gore, no psychos, no disasters. The movie portrayed Elizabeth II as the Queen of England should be: dignified, reserved, and serious in the face of a callous media. It's a movie one wants to watch again and again.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this for my husband a while back. I must say, I was very impressed. Not only do you get the 'dvd' version - but you get the theatrical version along with some other great 'goodies'. Instead of buying single disc sets or single discs, I would strongly recommend this. It's kindof an all in one pack... You definately get what you pay for if not more!
B000VWYJ86|4.0|A very well done movie with plenty of action and suspense. Edge of your seat thriller. You really understand Bourne's identity and background in this movie.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|The movie was new as ordered and arrival to my home expedient.  Very happy and pleased with this purchase.      It is an excellent family movie.
6305657947|5.0|I love this movie. It is fun, sexy, interesting, and what an adventure. Brosnan and Russo play off each other and the tension is wonderful to watch. Dennis Leary plays a great role also and is a great counterpoint to Brosnan. This is a gotta have it and watch it multiple times kind of movie because you can't pick out everything that is going on without watching multiple times.
1878424777|5.0|This is a precious little book. Full of insight and guidance for paece in your life. I highly recommend.
B0000067L4|5.0|Thank goodness for CD's. My friend had worn out his vinyl copy and was becoming despondant! Balance is restored.
B000WLIEKK|5.0|At first, I was skeptical about this album.  I didn't think that it was a good as \\"One Day Remains\\", at first.  When I listened to it a lot, then it grew on me and I totally love it and just can't quit listening to it.  It is so great.  The music is just totally SICK and the \\"feel good\\" of the songs just make you sit there in awe.  If you like rock and roll, then this album is for you.
0143113100|5.0|Remember when it was believed that little could be done about brain damage? That once brain cells died, that's it, it's over, kaput!?  Or that exercising your memory does little if anything to improve it, since the brain isn't really a muscle?  Remember when we used to think that certain sections of the brain were rigidly designated for certain functions and that other areas couldn't take over if needed (localizationism)? Or that we use only 10% of our brain?  Well the scientific and therapeutic opinion has changed remarkably since these and other brain myths have been debunked by recent compelling neuroscience research!  And Dr. Norman Doidge elucidates these findings in this easy-to-read, enjoyable, and exciting book that highlights neuroplasticity.  Fact is that the brain positively changes and evolves through all sorts of novelty: the culture in which you live, unique enthralling experiences, new knowledge, new skills, and even as a result of limitations (which it is able to chart a course around if you dedicate focused attention to the task). The brain is far more flexible than was previously thought. And consistent with this finding, we are able to be much more flexible as well.<br /><br />\\"The Brain that Changes Itself\\" is one of the most fascinating books I've read in a long time.  I'm certain that my brain's ability has been expanded simply through the process of reading it.  And I believe that you'll experience the same kind of growth. Do yourself and your brain a favor by absorbing this enlightening book.<br /><br />--Fred P. Gallo, PhD, Author of [[ASIN:1572241950 Energy Tapping]] and [[ASIN:1572245018 Energy Tapping for Trauma: Rapid Relief from Post-Traumatic Stress Using Energy Psychology]]
0751532711|4.0|This book does a great job of explaining the endless rut that everyone slips into unless they're one of the few who break away.  It is based on the idea that you will never be on top unless you OWN the corporations, instead WORKING for them.  Personally I think it's a little on the extreme side.  Yes, Social Security and taxes and pension plans and other seemingly useless programs suck the life out of us, but that doesn't reeeeally mean that you'll NEVER overcome it without being a boss.  None the less, the book is a terrific eye opener that I will refer to other high school students and parents alike.  It gives the basic education we kids need that the schools definitely do NOT teach us.  Education that is 100% necessary for life during and after college. GOOD ENGAGING READ!!! (coming from someone who is NOT a reader!)
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Easily the best version of an already-terrific movie. The visuals are much cleaner and crisper than ever before. All of the annoying voice-overs are gone. A few scenes have been cut down or lengthened. The end result is a much more coherent movie. Much easier to follow, much more enjoyable. Absolutely spectacular.
B00122O34O|5.0|This little gem of a movie is balanced by a very well chosen score weaving in and out of folk-indie pop etc,and manages to pull off a sophisticated and engaging soundtrack. The new \\"anyone else is you\\", and \\"All I want is you is folk inspired and produced in an elegantly human way.The new vocals remind me of why I liked folk in my 60's youth. My students(high school) love this cd,and I do too!<br />What a refreshing cd!
B000KZ3BWE|5.0|Don't come to it looking to attack Gore, \\"lib-burls\\" or some other straw man. Gores arguments that the Earth is becoming warmer can be proven by simply keeping a daily record of the temperature. How much is  due to the burning of fossil fuel is an open question although, again it can be proven, that CO2 does trap heat & prevent from radiating into space. Due yourself a favor and watch it, you might learn something. No one every died from the truth, but many have died from lies
B000VWYJ86|5.0|This came at the perfect time, actually it came earlier than I expected. Was complete in package and my aunt enjoyed it. Thanks!!
B000FFJYCU|5.0|If you love racing - this has some of the best racing action I've ever seen.  Just watch the opening sequence and you'll be hooked. An excellent film with great performances and a legendary director.  It does tend to go on and on for a long time, but the racing footage is worth it.  More of a story than the 'pure' racing film LEMANS - which I highly recommend as well, the movie really gives you the feel of the grands prix world of the mid-late sixties - back when men were men and racing was real - no radios or Eprom chips, just engines, gearboxes and grit.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Such a wonderful movie and now to see this Classic in beautiful color is outstanding!
B000WCBPOG|5.0|If you saw the movie Across the Universe and loved it you will love the soundtrack too.
0784011710|2.0|The only good thing about this movie was Meryl Streep (who deserves 5 stars). I was looking forward watching this movie (when I got it) but I was very disappointed!
B000VS6PD2|5.0|The title of my review says it all. Never before have hotter beats, wilder synths and samples and cool ideas been put together as well. For longtime fans, yes it's a live album but everything is mixed in such a crazy way that this could only be considered a new album with new songs, like Daft Punk sampling themselves to make something cooler than anything before it. To anyone who couldn't make it to the actual show, I'm sorry but you really missed it. It's like passing up a chance to see Hendrix, Nirvana or Joy Division live. Anyone who missed it and is ripping on the group has no idea what they're talking about. The picture booklet will give you an idea, though. The Lollapalooza show blew my mind, and I can tell the Paris show recorded for these discs was equally sick. At moments like those to be alive is wondrous, but to be young is quite heaven. The bonus disc is so worth owning, as the encore was when the show's many ideas came together - Human, together, celebrate, one more time! The bonus version is the superior product, although if you can't get ahold of it, at least get the single disc version. Merci Daft Punk!
