B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|[...]    There is more to say to expose this book for what it really is -- a fraud of unoriginal scholarship, by a very slick self-promoter: hence the # 1 slot on so many best-seller lists. Also, the book is pitched to the most uninformed readers. No serious historians take Aslan seriously. He's a creative writing teacher, who is totally dedicated to \\"selling\\" Islamic culture to naive westerners.
B008220BLG|4.0|With all the zombi movies floating around theaters I noticed the reviews were good for this one. I don't usually purchase this type of movie but i went ahead and got this one.<br />It's quite good, not too much gore and good acting, it's a good movie.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|I am starting to see some closure coming. Took me a while to get through this book. These books, in my opinion, aren't as good as Jordan's WOT series. They do however tell a good story without getting too fantastical and generally keep you wanting to read more.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I get on here and I play for hours and forget what time it is some times. Awesome game just wish it was easier for ppl that don't pay for stuff can get better gear
B0097EWK3A|1.0|Offer the game for free and you can not even get past entering your name. I tried on two separate devices several times and that is as far as I could get.  I realize the sample is what was free however ya gotta be able to play that before you can see if you want to buy the whole game.  Shame on you Big Fish.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game of Bingo. It's very exciting I love the music in the background.haven't sighted on to play on Facebook but am thinking about it. Hope it stays as exciting without signing onto Facebook.
B000002AGB|5.0|I have Live at Leeds also, but the Isle of Wight concert feels more lively. LaL has a tad bit better sound quality overall but both are worth having.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is really cool and scary but it gets boring after a while so they should make a sequel.
B000SGSU58|4.0|Got my attention from the first page. Could not predict the end even though I have read Connelly's works in the past.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Very interesting. # brain teaser. It really makes you think about the objects and how you could make another word out of it.
0060007737|5.0|This book was shipped very fast, I had purchased for a college course I took. It was practically brand new, no writing in the book at all, and no highlighting which was a good thing.<br /><br />Great reference book to use after graudation, will keep in my library of books.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game it is very fun and addictive each time I die I wanna play again it is so hard not to keep on playing 7 to 8 times
1400032717|2.0|It was a school book reading assignment. Would have never read it after the first few pages if I didn't have to.
B000031EGV|4.0|A fun and exciting film.  I never tire of watching it.  The story and casting are great.  And the price was great.  Who could ask for more?
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|The movie is Great and heart breaking. Anthony Hopkins plays the doctor and John Hurt is the elephant man. It is about the struggle of a deformed man trying to find his humanity.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|The next film in the Awakening series, this entry takes place in the near future where humanity has finally discovered the existence of vampires and werewolves and taken steps to wipe them out.  In this dystopic future, our heroine, Selene, has revived from suspended animation and escaped into a newly hostile world.  On top of that, an old enemy has returned to make its presence felt.<br /><br />I thought the idea behind the film was interesting, but far-fetched, even for this genre.  Still, it was fun and exciting, and left room for yet another film in this series.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Due to the title, I did not expect much. The movie is action packed and Daniel Craig is a tough outlaw. The theme iis about a mans redeption. The past is not who you are, only today counts. Great show.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|What can you say about the end of the world?  John Cusack and company do a great job with an absurd premise.  It's fun, exciting, suspenseful, and utterly ridiculous, but who wouldn't know that going in?
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Following on from the success of their 1978 London-recorded debut and a busy year touring, Dire Straits' second album was recorded in December of the same year at Compass Point Studios in The Bahamas and released in June 1979.<br /><br />With the same line-up as the eponymously titled first album, `Communique' has a similar feel with clean arrangements again dominated by Mark Knopfler's song writing and laconic slice-of-life lyrics, his distinctive vocal delivery alternating with attention-grabbing and note-perfect runs on his Fender Strat.<br /><br />As with the debut album `Communique' contains nine songs, kicking off with `Once Upon a Time in the West' which has a slow, funky rhythm and Dylanesque storyline themed (for the first time) on an American town, and doubtless targeted at the band's emerging young American audience. `Where do you think you're going?' is (almost uniquely in the Mark Knopfler songbook) a deeply personal minor-key piece about relationship break-up sung in the first person, with poignant lyrics and great musical dynamics. Other highlights are `Lady Writer' which became a successful single, `Angel of Mercy' with some great blues guitar work and the enigmatic `Portobello Belle', a perennial favorite and one of DS' best-ever songs.<br /><br />This album received minor criticism for being `too much like the first album' and, paradoxically, being `boring with few good songs'. I beg to differ: though similar in theme, this collection is more mature and reflective than the debut, the song writing and arrangements interesting and varied, and its production values are even better. It's a bit `quieter' overall, but not much. `Communique' stands up to the years well, is a classic album in every sense and hasn't aged a day.
B000A88EV4|4.0|A rather strange film with a strange cast of characters ostensibly centered around a narcissistic and arrogant &#34;philosopher.&#34;  All the characters, which include several put-on women and the men who abuse them, lead rather sad and squalid lives, which renders the film a bit hard to take.  It should not be watched lightly.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|this is truly an additive game. I am on everyday collecting my credits and look forward to completing each room!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Full disclosure: I've used Roku for years, thought I'd try this because it's so cheap, and to personally \\"beta-test\\" it.  And I don't use my smart-phone for stuff like this, so if that's important to you, it's a point in Chromecast's favor -- I'm fine with Roku's dedicated remote.<br /><br />Chromecast works fine for Netflix and Youtube -- FORGET, for now, Google's promise of casting a Chrome browser tab to your TV with this, at least for streaming video, such as Amazon Live or the many sites with video clips. My laptop (a few feet from the Chromecast dongle) streams video just fine, but Chromecast, for now, really only works for those sites that have dedicated apps allowing direct streaming to Chromecast, the major ones (for me) being Netflix and YouTube. The Chrome browser tab broadcast to the Chromecast dongle is HORRIBLE for video, in the current Beta.<br /><br />Bottom line: Roku has Netflix AND Amazon Live Video, but not (in my current iteration of Roku, at least) YouTube. Chromecast has Netflix and YouTube but NOT (as far as I can tell) Amazon Live.  I believe both have HuluPlus. Roku's cheapest, at 50 bucks, is fine so the price difference isn't all that huge.<br /><br />So there you have it: Do you care more about Amazon videos, or about YouTube, on your TV?<br /><br />Also: Be aware that unless your TV has a spare USB port to power the Chromecast, you may need to use the AC adapter, which is included but makes the Chromecast dongle get alarmingly hot (which Google calls \\"normal\\" for the device).
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|I was skeptical that something so simple would work but it did for me. I watched the instruction video on how to apply and followed its directions. After the 2 minute dry time with the hair dryer, i tried it and it worked. The website said there would be some discoloration but I didn't care, they are motorcycle gloves. Not fashion gloves.
B008Y72BD0|1.0|Childish coverage of a very important historical location. I was fortunate that I was able to visit Persepolis years ago. Very well preserved because of the low humidity. At that time there were no tourist in the three days I was there and no restriction I was even able to climb into the nearby tombs up very unstable scaffolding. (Not very smart)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is so original and fresh, each season v brings more mystery and shock. The last episode almost left me in tears.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can get caught up before the 4th season starts. I'm a late comer to the series. Enjoy watching it on my iPad.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't quite know what to say about this book. I feel the lump in my throat and the tears in my eyes tell the story and it's emotional impact better than my words can. It's stunningly beautiful.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|More challenging than I expected, but also fun and addictive! I'm still learning my way around the game and discovering different parts which is holding my interest longer than some other games. Looking forward to solving more of these challenging puzzles!
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Just a cute, mindless, fun flick. Great boy meets girl love story.  Entertaining movie for anyone to watch. Recommend it
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Liked how helpful it was at reminding me to perform tedious maintenance on my kindle fire HD. I didn't pay much attention to it until I was reminded. Then I was thankful.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game!!  I started out playing it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 synced to my Gmail email address, and when I got my kindle I downloaded it thinking I can sync it with my email but found out it only allows your account to be synced with Facebook.  I do not have a Facebook account.  Please add an option to allow sync with gmail and I will give 5 stars. Also the chat feature would be nice!
B0063M22QO|5.0|Have played before & I just can't quit once I get started. Great way to pass the time. I would recommend.
B00AE1P8UM|5.0|I read this book maybe 28 - 30 years ago.  There were passages from the book that I could not let go of in my mind.  I couldn't remember some small statement Dr. Murphy made so I had to have the book again.  I loved reading it on my Kindle app.  I can pull up a page any time I like.  I can read in the middle of the night.  The message of the power of my subconscious mind has changed how I view the world, life, and myself.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|I'm keeping this short and sweet. This is TTB's best work yet. This the best album I've purchased this year, from track 1 thru track 11 not a clunker on the album.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe reader is the primer reader on the market.  It is greater for PDF formats.  I use it for nearly everything except reading books.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|While much of the research cited was done earlier, the value of the book is in bringing it all together to provide a compelling picture of Jesus as a political figure.
B004I744AS|5.0|This dictionary has been so beneficial to me in school work, everyday definition needs, and finding information quickly.  The functions of the site are very helpful and efficient.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|I love this movie and have watched it multiple times. Really at the heart of it, we are all a little crazy. This movie reminds me of a Doctor Seuss quote:<br /><br />We are all a little weird and<br />life's a little weird,<br />and when we find someone whose<br />weirdness is compatible with ours,<br />we join up with them and fall in<br />mutual weirdness and call it love.<br /><br />There's a reason why this movie was so highly touted.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I just started using the Kindle app.  I am still learning to navigate the app.  It has proven great so far.  I am looking for more books and time to read them.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is full of creative and commonsensical ideas at the same time. But the main thing is that it inspires you to act and not to look for excuses.. They make very good money on publishing the books with his wife but they're amazing and it's worth every penny. The book is perfectly readable and written in a professional way but without any complicated definitions. You don't need to have a financial degree to read and comprehend this book.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|From the first try I liked Dropbox.  I have used it for nearly two years now.  I even recommended it to business people who have used it.  It is great for my friends, family, and I to share photos, documents, and links rapidly.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very interesting, highly addictive, can't seem to put my computer down at night.  Find lots of things to do, lots of ways to make things better, just don't know if I will ever find the time to do everything I pin if I don't stop looking at Pinterest!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is one of my most favorite series. I am glad it is here to watch when ever I wish.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|It's witty, funny, and well written. The characters are complex and the show is well put together. This is a must see.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Bought this for our car remotes, cheaper than going to the dealer to change it.  Most remotes have the battery number on them, or just open them up and check the number before you order.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Why does this app need info on my wi-fi network? I make a habit of reading opinions but became lazy in reading &quot;Permissions&quot;. I'm noticing more and more apps now taking questionable liberties in surveying my device and activities. As another user noticed, there are some apps wanting to record/read my text messages and monitoring what other applications I'm running. (Doors and Rooms.) Not cool... not cool at all. Be advised. Be careful. Read comments and permissions before you install.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Good for the price.  I am rating it four stars as it did have a very bad odor for a few months, could not leave it in the house for a while.  It is great for going for walks, holding phones, mail, bottles, and our drinks.  Other than the smell, we like it.
B004UXUUDA|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but it couldn't meet my level of expection after reading the novel.  Of course, books are always better than movies, and this one followed that trend!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|As a former Christian, a used to be in the camp that the Bible was the infallible word of God.  When I came to accept that I was Gay that stance became unsustainable.  This book gave me a very approachable run down on what the New Testament means in a historical context.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Maybe I like this because I was not such a huge fan of the original &#34;Wizard of OZ&#34;. Also, I think seeing this film in 3D makes a huge difference. It is amazing how Sam Raimi makes use of the 3D effect to create depth and texture that makes the film pop off the screen.<br /><br />If you take this film on it's own merit as a unique production seperate from the original, this is an immensely satisfying film. If you absolutely love the original and expect a prequel to that film, you will likely be disappointed. Warner Brothers took quite a bit of artistic license in the original film that they have copyright over. This presented a real challenge to Sam Raimi and the writers. If you pay close attention to the film there are a lot of hidden gems regarding characters identities linking back to the original film and within the new one.<br /><br />Ultimately, just sit back and enjoy the story and the film. To paraphrase Glenda in the film...This may not be the Wizard we were waiting for, but it is the best Wizard we have, and I and my family really enjoyed it. The ultimate test is that both my wife and my 7yo son have watched it repeatedly.<br /><br />That is the ultimate thumbs up!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm amazed how much character development has been strung within this book. If you've read the first and second book, I'd say you HAVE TO READ THIS ONE to have closure.
B000FA675C|5.0|This was an incredible story. I literally read it in one sitting. I just couldn't put it down. I don't say that often, nor does it happen often...not with 400 page books. Terrific story and that it was free as well surprised me! Wonderful ,wonderful story!
B007AL48UK|5.0|I really like this game. It has neat pictures, and gives a new look to the typical pictures other games have. You can pause your game, and it doesn't have a timer so you can take you time playing. It does clock you, so you can compete with your previous scores. Try this game and see if you like it as much as I do...
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another incredible score for Stephen King. This was a great story with an ending that surprised me. I thought he would go back in time again....oh well...I won't spoil it. Loved this story although it was longer than I expected. But no matter. It didn't drag and the pace was always fast. Terrific book...so glad I got it.
B008IGP8LY|1.0|The 1 star rating is a reflection of the quality of the vinyl pressing, not the score itself!  I would rate Zimmer's score a 4.<br />This pressing has major pops and ticks on side A.  Side B suffers the same defects, but not as numerous as the first.  Side A is nearly intolerable to listen to.  Track 3 actually skips.  I've purchased used vinyl 20+ years old that is better sounding.  I also purchased Man of Steel on vinyl, I'm afraid to put it on the turntable!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Very amusing td lots of cool units and abilities plus plenty of crazy maps to challenge yourself with wherever you go
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  The action, story, graphics, and acting was really good.  I think it was well worth the money...
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I believe  in God, our Father, and there is a wonderful Heaven way above anything we can possibly imagine.  I was bogged down on many of he neurological details that Eben wrote which were suppose to be the proof of Heaven.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have enjoyed every book by James Rollins and 'The Eye of God' was no exception. Very hard to put down.
0307352153|3.0|I think it's very admirable that Cain has tried to write a book on this subject, because it has definitely been underserved area of discussion.<br /><br />Reviews of this book seem to be split along a few different lines. One group of readers love the book because it has articulated a message (or perhaps offered a justification/excuse?)regarding the benefits of an introverted personality. The second group of readers are people (like myself) that find the message to be refreshing, however, are left feeling unfulfilled by the lack of depth and reliance by the author on anecdotes rather than the voluminous academic literature. And when Cain does go on to draw on the psychology literature, she seems to be doing too much picking and choosing and I got the distinct feeling that she is trying to fit a square peg in a round hole all too often.<br /><br />One of the other principle difficulties that the book encounters is that the necessary vocabulary needed to have a nuanced enough discussion of the concepts with a lay reader (I inc. myself in that group) is not present. Perhaps it would have been a step too far for Cain to introduce new vocabulary to the audience, but the word introvert gets used so many times and in so many different ways, it ends up becoming a catch all term.<br /><br />I couldn't but help think about a comparison with Daniel Kahneman's book 'Thinking Fast and Slow', which addressed many deeper and more complicated topics (also to a lay audience) but managed to do so in a way that felt fulfilling. It is akin to being shown a map full of new and interesting landscapes. This is enough to catch your interest, but then Kahneman satisfies that interest by taking you on a tour stopping at the major landmarks. By the end, you realize that there is very much more to things than meets the eye. In contrast, Cain's book is akin to flying overhead at 30,000 ft and pointing out the window. Certainly better than nothing, but by no means should that be the end of the story. Perhaps the author would defend herself by saying this is what she intended, but given the hype that this book has garnered, perhaps I was expecting more. An example of this is Cain's over-use of anecdotes rather than relying on the academic literature. Perhaps a greater background in psychology would have helped.<br /><br />Cain's book addresses an area that has not nearly been explored thoroughly enough but it is at least a marker in what was previously an ignored territory. For that reason alone it is worth a read, but it is just not a book you will find yourself returning to again and again.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|The whole premise is stupid, but man is it fun to play.  The combination of the action and then buying/selling strategy (luck) make it more addicting than you might think.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|didn't realize how great this would be in connecting me to my files on my home network.  It really opened up what I could do with my kindle fire
B0000028M7|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time. It's dark, creative, and depressing. Yet it's still a pleasure to listen to even after who knows how many listens.<br />Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell were up there with Lennon/Mccartney as one of the best duets in rock n roll history. They create a beautiful yet eerie harmony in almost all their songs.<br />If you love music, give this a listen.
B00009YOQW|4.0|It is very well made, and my one-year-old grandson loves playing it, and the tones are agreeable to adult ears.  He has to be watched, though, when using the mallet, as he could poke himself in the eye or throat, plus I read that the rubber tip on the mallet can come off.  I showed him how he could use a large plastic peg from a game to bang on it, and that worked fine.  Yes, I would buy it again for him, for it seems to be the best one out there for these little ones.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love bingo blitz it is the best of all the free ones.  I have had a few problems with the way to get my credits from them. Also i have not received my credits from them in the link on Facebook.  But i really love the game i wish they would have more shadow cards sometimes they rarely been showing up, and i spend alot of credits way too many to complete the rooms.  I also paid for credits i did not recieve.  It seems like the game changed so much you can't win.  But I am still addicted to the best game I have played.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game I deleted all the games that r kind of like it on my kindle fire HD love it
0345529057|5.0|Love the HBO show, so I had to read these to find out what was going to happen after season 2. It is beautifully written and lets my imagination flourish. I received my books in perfect condition with a very reasonable cost.
B000T433L0|5.0|No worries! Shipped quick. Great product. Classic movie. DeNiro at his finest.<br /><br />You talking to me?<br /><br />I'm the only one here!
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I really love the app, but when I got the full version, the videos wouldn't load, and when I tried to exit, it crashed. Please fix.
030758836X|5.0|Well written, fast paced, and well executed.  This is one amazing story full of smoke and mirrors where everything is not what it seems, wait...or is it?  A roller coaster of a ride that peaked where it wasn't expected and never really came back down to the bottom.  Everything negative that I have read mostly has to do with the ending.  Well...I don't want to give anything away, but in a Basic Instinct kind of way it entirely made sense to me and never failed to let me down.  Read it.
B003FNWR6Y|4.0|this comes with cute tokens and cards. wish the tokens are bigger and tthere are more types of tokens though.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This is the best \\"relationship\\" book I've ever read. It's a very easy read and its contents are so real and logical. It has worked wonders in our 30+ year marriage. The common sense applications not only make the lightbulbs go on, but make you wonder, \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" Or, \\"Why didn't I see that?\\" A definite read for all couples!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Best Games Ever. I Love this Game. keep u busy when you are bored.  its a must get game.  so stop what h doing n download it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A cool temple run like game. The roll could last a little longer because I come up short all the time.  The game is fun and addicting.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game, even on my<br />small kindle. Very enjoyable.  I love these kind of escape from rooms games.
1416955070|5.0|Perfectly in good condition new and everything but one thing I didn't like about it which is ...NOTHING! Everything was perfect and plus the book was really good! I mean it's amazing ! Perfecto
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the social and relational layers and the effort to portray the difficult social, economic, and cultural changes of the time.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|Total escapism into another era, beautifully filmed, a few aspects that are not explained but then you need to use your imagination!
B00A285OOW|5.0|Great history novel of strong woman when woman had very little power.  Ms Gregory brings the times and the people to life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It really makes you think about life, the what ifs and the maybes. Just one second could change the outcome of so ,any lives.
0385349947|5.0|This was an easy read - great examples that I could relate to in my own career. Have already put into action some of Sheryl's recommendations and have shared this book with others. Highly recommend to other women, no matter what type of job or position.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|Michael Connelly at his best! A thrilling, suspenseful page turner! Could not put it down! Simply put: Magnificent! Now it's your turn. ENJOY!
B005O64VJQ|5.0|This is a great movie, even better in Blu-ray. I wish they would bring more of these classics back in Blu-ray.
0316247545|4.0|Both my six year old and nineteen year old like this text. Interesting insights into the creation of the new pony phenomenon.
B000I9YXHY|5.0|One of my all time favorites. It is a must watch movie. Thanks for having it available. Steph. F. Utah
B007EECSFA|4.0|I like Morton's tales. Draws characters well. Keep notes with names as the tales jump all over the decades with the same names & drastically different circumstances.
B0030MM68O|5.0|I really liked every aspect of this movie.  Fell in love with Jeremy Renner in this one.  I liked the effects and story line.
B009JZPH32|3.0|So I like Oliver Stone movies, and it was a pretty wild ride and the time went by fast. I thought there would have been a little more to do with the cartel but seems not. If I had to I would rent it and not buy. That to mean loses another star since if you only watch it once and may not again why bother? Unlike the movie The Losers, it's easy to want to watch it again and again.
B000002U94|4.0|What can I say, always sounds good. Classic rock! It has a good assortment of his stuff. I bought it specifically for Fire Down Below.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great book.  The characters are very interesting and I read it very quickly, an easy read.  I look forward to reading more books written by Colleen Hoover.
B0052RE4MQ|3.0|I had such high hopes but this book was disappointing. Nothing happened. Should have been 1 chapter at the end of the Matched.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|If you have never played the Walking Dead, get this. This is a great game. It's a game you choose how to play story wise. It's a VERY fun game. You get 6 \\"episodes\\" (The Walking Dead 400 days I would say a spin off and a \\"what if\\" kind of episode.) If you loved it on the PS3, and have a Vita, get it. This is a rare port of a game from PS3 to Vita that is actually great. (cough cough) Much better than the pathetic Jak HD Collection port to the Vita.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />AMAZING STORY<br /><br />Easy Platinum trophy<br /><br />Game looks great.<br /><br />Trophies don't cross over for PS3 and Vita, so you can earn them all again!<br /><br />You are given 2 ways to control the game in the beginning, by touch screen or with buttons.<br /><br />20$ on PSN, and only 2297mb game (2.3GB) Great game.<br /><br />The Walking Dead on a great console.<br /><br />Hours of entertainment.<br /><br />You get ALL the episodes on the digital and physical version, and don't have to pay more for the extra content.<br /><br />Runs pretty well.<br /><br />Only con:<br /><br />Loading constantly. The game might freeze for a second and then get back to gameplay. That's the only thing I have against this version.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love  Sylvia Day's writing and I can not wait for the next book in this series!!!  This one left me speechless
B00354YA2M|4.0|A very interesting story of historical Australia and the many characters who played a role in those years in the formation of Australia as we see it now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Words would not do this series any justice! I enjoyed this book every time I read it. Now on to book two!
0345803485|1.0|How this book got on a best sellers list is amazing. Every chapter is the same as the one before. The so called steamy parts of the book were lame. The repetition of the same words, phrases, sentences used again and again and again were mind numbing! This book is horrible.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Good plot, very in depth building story background at the expense of action scenes.  While I employed the movie overall, I thought it was as much to set up the sequel as to stand on its own.  Good cast and special effects.
B00CWVBV4E|4.0|Anything lego, the kids love to watch, my son is no different.  Its a good kids show and keeps them entertained.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|My children love this game however they were able to charge almost $250 for extra coins even though I had parental control over my kindles. Even though this game is free they get their money in other ways. So if you purchase this game please be careful that your children don't do what mine did!
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great controller, works great and have had no issues with linking up or falling out while playing.  Its OEM and shouldn't I guess.
B004X6PRO6|1.0|I tred, really tried to get into this but just couldn't.<br />I didn't understand what/where/who this was supposed to be about.<br />Would not recommend at all.
B00CQWA30C|4.0|good movie the plot was good, had a sort of hunt for red October feel to it.  Though I remember this story in the news.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I have the kindle fire and I try to connect to my friends minecraft world and I can't please fix that and I'll give minecraft five stars
B00BN2NQFU|4.0|Its a great circus, and at least watching it this way, you can see whats going on, in person you are not always at the right view to see everything.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|I regret spending 4.99 to rent this movie. Absolutely not worth it. Tarantino botched it. If you haven't seen it yet, don't.
B00D37UP4S|4.0|Plot was ok, the effects are decent.  I have no issues here, was a pretty good movie, the wife enjoyed it more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game for my 3 year old when I need him occupied for a period of time. Plus I love it too!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of my new favorite shows. I watched season 1 and 2 in less than a week. Love love love!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is fun to play for a short amount of time and it is addictive. I would get it if I was you
B00CTMA95S|3.0|Of course, you do have to accept the far-fetch premise before you read such book, which I did.  But some of the &#34;facts&#34; just don't line up right: the timeline of Genghis Khan's conquests and how far he and his grandson reached; the detailed descriptions of the sites and buildings in the Asian countries and cities....<br /><br />If you've never been to Asia, and not familiar with the Asian history, you'd probably not notice anything.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Firstly I have to say I enjoy simple digital photography but I am certainly no expert! However I know enough to say that this app is the best and easiest to use on my Kindle HD (which I also love and don't mind admitting it)<br /><br />Great value for money, gives excellent results for little effort.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well worth the read....all three were great books!! I highly recommend it for any age group. The author took the series to the end the way it should have been written without getting caught up in some sappy 'need to sell' story.
B004EPZ0AC|3.0|My grandson watches it and likes the action, so in that sense it services it's purpose.  I don't like the story line though, too much ecological bologna.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|This album is not what you may expect. There is lots of brass and not as much guitar. Susan's vocals may call Janice Joplin to mind!
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Conditions of my Parole does not disappoint.  Pusicfer is the chameleon of the music industry.  This album is so different from V for Vagina but is still great.  A must have.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Awesome game, ton of fun and really cute. Addictive and adds a bit of competition when linked to Facebook. Couldn't get much better, just wish there were more levels.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|An incredible book that sticks with you and makes you think about those whom you love and about what life is.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I luv this game. There are so many different rooms to choose from. I play everyday and there's always something new and interesting.
1609611543|4.0|This book was informative.  I didn't realize how unhealthy wheat really is for us.  It takes a lot of discipline to cut it out.  Useful information if you care about your health.
0810993139|5.0|Bought this book to see if my son would be interested and he loved it.  Bought the rest of the series.  Thanks for fast and friendly service.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|It is a good book, it brings back the time of Christ , the way people were living.  Very simple in comparison of today. -<br />It also proves that Jesus was alive and living at the time. That is a main point for many people.  But if you are looking for proof of  Jesus the Messiah , God with us,  I think you will look in vain.  After all , the writer is still a Moslem as far as I know.  Fred
B00CATSONE|4.0|Since the advent of the Tesla automobile, I've been tantalized by opportunities to learn a little more about the man beyond the invention of radio and the ever-famous Tesla Coil. The book is brief (perhaps a little too brief) and tries to focus on the nature of imagination. But the real meat of the book is the biographical overview of the man, his inventions, the politics of the time, and the adversities that he refused to let overwhelm him. What didn't quite work was the balance between the author's thoughts on the nature of imagination and the example of Tesla's unstoppable passion for investigation and invention. Tesla's life is far more interesting.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|I couldn't even figure out the setup portion.  Horrible, avoid at all costs. Don't even go there for 99 cents.
031623480X|5.0|This is just an excellent book, delving into the dangers of gluten full force.  I like that it emphasizes the latest studies on the dangers of gluten.  No, I don't agree with all the nutritional recommendations in this book, and I frankly feel going dairy free is just as important as going gluten free (hence my avoidance of his recipes with heavy cream and goat cheese...), but still, 5 stars just for giving us another book about the dangers of gluten.  Today's gluten grains resemble nothing like the pure wheat of biblical times.  Today they are more akin to chemicals than plants, and that's a shame.  Kudos to the author for giving us a non-stop emphasis on its dangers.  Highly recommended.
0312330537|3.0|I heard this was a superb booked but I was a little overwhelmed with I got it and it's so thick.  I don't have that much time to read so haven't started it yet.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Both of my kids (ages 4 and 8) love this game.  We don't have a Wii or anything similar to that and we closely monitor how much our kids play video games.  It's a strategic game that makes them think about their next move.
0316286443|5.0|This book was insightful and timeless. My current magazines utilize the techniques and looks referenced in this book. This is a great educational fun approach to learn about makeup application.
1591396190|4.0|I've purchased multiple used books on Amazon and for the price, I don't know why you would look anywhere else.  I received a hard back copy of this book that looks as if it has never been opened.  The book is an easy read.  I have only had it for 3 days and I have almost finished it.  Great information presented from a unique perspective into selling.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in business.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Any one who enjoys music and comedy will love it.  I cannot get enough.  I watch it frequently.  The costumes, scenery and location<br />are beyond belief.  My favorite scene was Streep's song before she ran up the steps back to the cottage.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was great. I would recommend it to anyone looking to communicate or understand their partner or any person better. The light bulb definitely went off!!!We are all unique and have different wants/needs in the book the five love language convey how these needs/wants can be met. Gary Chapman highlighted an important point that we must make decide to love, it is a choice. It is something we have to actively work at. I will definitely give the 5 Love Languages as gifts this year.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|I don't want to give a lot away so I'll have to be careful. I'm torn about this book. I've read some heavy material before this so going in I knew the subject matter wouldn't be an issue for me. It really shouldn't be an issue for anyone. This book is about a teenage girl's suicide and like it or not, teenage suicide is unfortunately not uncommon. I've got to say, being a teenage girl is freaking hard! I know. I've been there. And some of us are dealt an awful deck. This girl really didn't have it that bad. People did try to help. And we have all (at least I think) fallen victim to the vicious snowball effect. She gave up in the beginning, so when things got really bad there was just absolutely no turning back for her. She didn't want to. So, I don't think the point of this story is to cry over her. She had more issues with herself than the tapes ever dared to reveal. The point to it all is this; life is a bitch. To everyone. No one knows the pain and insecurities other people carry with them. So be careful with yourself and everyone around you, because as Hannah said, \\"everything affects...everything.\\"
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Dark, gritty and all too real. Jams N. Roses uses a stark writing style to provide the reader with an experience that few can match. The story is a coming of age story that doesn't sugar coat the all too real world experiences of sisters as they struggle though life's challenges.<br />Jams follows the sister's through the tragic death of a loved one, the hard drinking despair of a parent, drugs, sex and their jumble of emotions which they try in every way possible to  suppress them and bury then away inside to avoid as we all tend to do, dealing with them.<br />Despite the darkness, Jams provides a poignant story that is seriously great. I give it five stars.<br />Caution! When writing with passion your soul may catch fire and leave smoldering embers throughout your story. Go on, set the world on fire! ~Author Cliff Roberts
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Was entertaining.  Surprised to see Ian McShane in a role where he was nice lol  Worth watching Glad I saw it
1489559396|5.0|Sheryl Seal makes a smooth and seamless transition from the first book in the series: \\"Beyond BridalVail Falls\\" to this her second book, \\"Beyond Oria Falls.\\" As with first book it is a delightful tale filled with magic creatures and fantastical realm of other realities. The story continues and is once again focused on the golden Queen of the Ahwahneechees, and their continuing battle with the Ala. The second story focuses more on the Queen's destiny which is revealed through mystical encounters with her grandparents and the Great Spirit. The story's intensity and intrigue are less prominent in the second book though throughout there are undercurrents of smoldering romance, self-doubt, inner courage and resurgence of the sinister forces of evil.<br /><br />Despite the differences in the stories intensity and level of suspense from the first book, Beyond Oria Falls delivers a solid story filled imagination that left this reader eagerly awaiting the next installment in the series. Five Stars<br />\\"Follow your dreams and live the life you've imagined.\\" -Author Cliff Roberts
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|Not too bad.  Still a typical Tom Cruise.  Have to say I did like it.  Was surprised and not disappointed.
B00D7JGL36|2.0|I was a little disappointed with this Bakersfield Album. I am a big fan of Vince Gill. I don't believe it sounded good. I was expecting more from Vince Gill and his style of music.<br />I should of listen to it before I bought it.. I grew up in the Bakersfield area in the 70's and this did not trick my trigger.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|Didn't like this.  Felt like it was a waste of time and so very glad didn't waste money on it in the theater.
B0063FQLTK|5.0|Zaz Sans Tsu Tsou Live Tour is a great album and DVD. Zaz gypsy blues style is music for the soul. There is nobody quite like her. One of a kind...<br />I believe Zaz is catching on here in the USA. I can't seem to get enough of her music. Love the DVD of her concert. Some of Zaz's music has showed up in a movie here in the states. ( Dead Man Down ). Truly a universal style of music. Give her a try and enjoy..
B004TOC8HQ|5.0|I remember this album growing up as a kid.  It was part of who I was.  It will always be an important album to own.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|I can listen all the way through I love Laura's voice! The vocals are so fresh. Its a must buy for sure!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|This was a disappointing book. Maybe it wasn't what I was expecting. Not enough zombie action or action period. I'll bet the movie is better. All I could picture was the people talking, not the war. Bummer
B00457WZEI|5.0|This is a great book and a great movie. The story is an easy read for any age. A great story about a horse named Joey and his owner. They both go through hell and back to find one another.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|like the cast, especially the way the story behind kirk un-folds. sometimes it's the journey, not just the big picture about a story. a really good film out of the gate. not really related to all the other ST movies, yet some little &#34;jibs&#34; in there as a nod. really makes Pine stand out..getting the latest ST movie as well. why can't they put em together? anyhoo...a good way to spend a couple hrs in front of the screen, whatever size.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The characters and scripts are very well written, and the actors have done complete justice to the part. Very addictive!!:)
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|Great Great movie.  Even I had to watch it twice.  Not much to say.  Really good movie.  U wiil just have to watch it
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|please put the real candy crush on kindle. tried the others but theyre a waste of time. the other games are not as thrilling
B003TOMAPC|4.0|It was different and funny.  I am a a supper hero fan so I liked the story.  I especially liked the quirky way it was narrated
B000X2H8G4|4.0|I purchased this for my stubborn, 82 y.o. father who won't get hearing aids.  It does amplify ALL sound and does so very effectively.  Ideal for those hard or hearing folks watching TV.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Seemed like I could have written the plot.  I knew what was going to happen and how it would end.  Some say that was the intent of the movie.  I usually like more development in a story
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Absolutely great movie for all ages.Well written,acted and directed. It demonstrates to others to persevere in life no matter how bleak things look. There is always hope and light at the end of the tunnel.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I liked it the twist was good but the story seemed to have end without answering a lot of questions.  I wonder if they will make a squeal or something.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|it continues to give such an honest portrayal of the generation; with remarkable insight into  the need  for and the implementation of a new social society
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun, easy game. It is extremely addictive. Only down side is that it takes forever to load.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun and addicting game. it is very interesting as a side scroll. I just downloaded it and and stop playing.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Fun game. Has issues with response time and connectivity which drives me crazy.<br />Very addictive though. Like the free daily tournament even though the winning is not that easy.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|There is not hardly a day that goes by that i don't play this game. Very addictive! love it! Keeps your mind active and it is very challenging. I try to keep getting a better time on each level.
0061900656|5.0|Perfect storybook to prepare the big brother for a new baby.  It's so important to make the brother feel a part of the new baby coming into the family.  This book will do that.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This version is so cool!  It has the option to hear Human again, or not to.  Great Disney movie.  Beauty and the Beast.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I enjoyed it, it made me want to read the next book. I just felt like it was a little slow at first however I understand that writers do have to take their time when getting into the excitement.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|Wonderfully made, beautifully woven story.  Impressive, restrained performances.  Beautiful original music by Eastwood.  In my opinion, it is a masterpiece.
1423113462|5.0|This is really a great, easy to read, adventure book.  I purchased it for a recent trans Atlantic flight and it kept me delighted during all the long hours across and back.  I have now ordered the second in this series.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I'm still getting familiar with the songs but so far I really like it.  Well worth the cost of downloading.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Everyone get the game it is cool is start playing minecraft pc and kindle fire<br />even though you can only be Steve.in the kindle fire I like the pigs
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed to movie thoroughly and am looking forward to the next movie. I enjoyed being able to watch this movie n amazon instant play!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Nerdy, geeky, exciting...a REALLY wonderful read. I can't recommend it highly enough, especially if you have any interest in video games or the 80s.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I would definitely recommend this novel!!!  It was an absolutely great historical fiction novel!  It opened my eyes to the lives of those who lived during the 18th century!
B0001I561E|4.0|Was super excited to have this movie on DVD. Was a little disappointed that the movie froze just before the end. We've replayed it a few times and it freezes in the same place. Not sure what to do...oh well.
0451418441|5.0|Like many, I read and loved Pillars of the Earth. After reading such a hefty tome (that took me month to finish due to time constraints) I decided to take a break from Ken Follett and try some lighter reading even though World Without End was sitting on my bookshelf. I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />Many reviews criticize World Without End for being a two century later vague rehashing of Pillars of the Earth and I agree to a point. In fact, that was one of the things I rather enjoyed about this book. I loved Pillars so much that the same formula worked wonders for me. I would be very happy to see a third eventually produced along the same lines.<br /><br />One thing that draws me into Follett work is his character development. I find myself hurting with them, talking aloud in disgust at them, and cheering with them. The reason they are so captivating to me is that they are rounded. Some character are more two dimensional than others (e.g. later introduced characters or some of the secondary characters like Alan Fernhill) but the characters in which you are truly invested often show multiple sides to their personality and made me wonder whether I truly loved or loathed them.<br /><br />I will say that Follett's research into the time period is magnificent as well. After reading for long stints I found myself obsessively washing my hands forgetting the plague is all but entirely a thing of the past. He paints rich scenery not through the use of visual description but through the characters eyes. This history and attachment kept engrossed through the entire novel. When the time came to finish the last page I was sad to see it go. It will be revisited.
0316228583|1.0|It was filthy. I was so excited to see what else she could come up with but it was hard to see past all of the language and sexual content to see if it was good writing anyway.  She distracted from the story instead of enhancing it.  So disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game. Play it twice daily, once in the morning before work I play the free daily tournament, then play blackout bingo in the evening. Play the other rooms with whatever credits I have left over.
B00A83075M|5.0|Absolutely Fantastic. An entire story told from the view of the &#34;bad guy&#34;. Sweet, cute, incredibly awesome! Watched the movie in the theatre... twice.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I was very disappointed after playing several games and now unless I purchase stars, keys, something, I can no longer play.  I did not know that when I put the game on my kindle.  I have since taken it off.  I didn't even have time to get in the groove of the game as I am not a regular bingo player.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|If you care about music at all, you need to know about this strange chapter in musical history. It is simply sad that digital has yet to live up to the promises made decades ago, except in destroying much of the fertile ground of creating beautiful music together.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|My husband and I love this show.  It's amazing how beautiful the scenery is and the clothes are gorgeous.  Great cast of characters.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was awesome!!! It was so I intersecting. The pictures were awesome.<br />I can not wait for hollow city to come out.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|This movie is a great adventure movie about kids, but not necessarily for kids. There are a few instances of the S word, but if you're a grown up it just makes the movie even more funny.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I no longer enjoy the game ! Too many changes and not for the better. You canno longer gift as many items. Slots have too high betting minimums. Almost all changes benefit only owners. People will stop playing.This review has nothing to do with services from Amazon they are great!
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Loved this movie. I expected a lot of the action but the twist to the characters was more than I had thought.
B00006D295|5.0|I got my package before the estimated time and it was just like it had been described.  So happy I went through them for this.
B006C45CFG|5.0|It is a great movie. Really good actors in it. I didn't think I would like it, but I really did.
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|I think this game is great but way to hard to play. My landing gear always fails. The rain mission is way to hard. If this app were 99 cents I wouldn't even look at it!!! Good thing it's free.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I've played many bingo games on my kindle, but not one with as many rooms and power ups as blitz. I love this app, but there are times that I don't receive credits when I get a bingo. Would like to see that fixed, but overall a really good time!
1449433251|4.0|Much better then i expected<br /><br />keeps me bussy the entire day<br /><br />really very nice thing to have does not get boring
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a great game...totally awesome...great fun for hour and hours at a time...a must have...so what are you waiting on...down load this great game now...Go go go...I play it on my kindle fire all of the time and I just can't get enough of memo and all of his ocean friends
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock is on time and actuate love this app great for kids and adults who need to wake up on time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am only 18 years old and I just got this game and I'm already addicted to it. I'm in love with this game and it's so much fun. It's really good for all ages
B0046B1KHG|4.0|The movie had a lot of interesting vehicle and weapon designs.  I loved the Squid launcher.  Very creative.  Can't wait to see the next one.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I have no bad things to say about this app. It is a wonderful messenger app if you want to chat. But, it does require Wi-Fi.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|better than the first book with a much deeper revenge plot.bdsm less prevelant in this book and the mutual love of the main characters shines through
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game ,it's fun I play it all day @ work best game ever I need rehab from this game .... Great game !!!!
B008C20TDG|5.0|If you can get through the science in the beginning of the book, though interesting information, it kind of made me glaze over. The Whole 30 Program is awesome. It really changed the way that I think about food. Though difficult, I lost 13lbs and completely changed my eating habits. I feel so much better. For anyone that wants to get in the best shape and change the way their body processes food, this book is a must.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|EMOJI stimulates your brain!!! Keep you guessing, and wanting more! A great way to relax and have fun at the same time. I love it!
B00BTHV05M|4.0|I like their sound - which was consistent throughout the album.<br />Some great tunes for speeding up my walking too.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|This was a wonderful book seen through the eyes and feelings of a horse....being raised on a farm I do feel that animals can feel and think this way.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very fun, addicting, says my 11 year old. She says it gets more challenging as you go on.  Failure makes you want to keep trying.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Very interesting book. I found it riveting. Nice to see the photos at the end via Kindle. Some readers didn't get those in their printed books.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Hope the franchise continues!  Hope they continue to develop Dr. Watson's wife into a major player and help to the team.
140006922X|4.0|This was a thought-provokng book, and I'm glad I read it. It took a of aspects of the life of Jesus that I've known since childhood but never managed to synthesize into a coherent, plausibly human whole as an adult. So I'm grateful.<br /><br />But I have two criticism. First, the structure of the book was a little hard to follow. The gross outline is chronological, but it breaks up that flow during the key years of Jesus's ministry to address different themes. I found that distracting.<br /><br />Second, Aslan does what he can with the minimal information that has filtered down through the ages, but he seems to overreach from plausible to proven fairly often. I find his picture of Jesus and his world completely believable, but it doesn't feel unshakeable. He can say a lot about what traveling preachers and revolutionaries in that time and place were like as a group, but there don't seem to be enough dots to connect to say something definitive about the man at the book's center.<br /><br />But I definitely recommend this book just for the power of reconsidering long-held ideas.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The only thing bad about the book is that it had to stop, it should have gone on a lot more.
B008Y6ZTKS|4.0|Watched with  9 and 11 year olds--both thought it was going to be too scary but both agreed that it was not at all! They have both asked to see it again and again! Great message! Inspirational!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|good game ...very addictive for both kids and adults.  wish they had more rooms though. looking forward to playing more.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|The original was a classic (in its day). This just isn't worth watching. It has no redeeming features. Don't say I didn't tell you.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This book was  good but not anywhere near &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; and the &#34;Kite Runner&#34;, two other books that Hosseini wrote.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I Love Sudoku for Kindle.  Easy touch screen with the kindle fire.  clarity is awesome. numerous levels of game play.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great story. What got me was how mature Ender Wiggin was throughout the story. Even when he was a small child, he carries the weight of the world upon his shoulders. Recommended!
B00006JL1Z|4.0|With 2 CDs there are plenty of great hits from this band included in this collection. But, still, I cannot listen to it that much for some reason. Many of the songs have great tunes and sounds, but can be depressing at the same time, which is why I have only given four stars.
B005ER6STG|1.0|another movie i didnt understand before i bought it, watch only a few minutes and broke it in two and trashed it, cant believe amazon even sells this stuff.
B002HFP0QU|4.0|The voices were a little tired, but the entire sound seemed richer than the original versions. So, after listening to it a few time, it grew on me.
0743298020|4.0|This book is really good. I am not a person who read too many books. I finished this book within 2-3 days because it was so interesting. I love to imagine the england's country side. I heard that BBC is making a movie on it. I would love to watch that.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I played the board game version of this with friends and thought it was fun,  but set up was pretty complicated. The tablet version of this takes the complications out of the set up! It's a great strategy game, and if you like this type of game, it will entertain you for hours and hours and hours.<br /><br />The only really crappy thing about this game is that the in-game tutorials are absolute garbage. If I hadn't played it first, I would have been lost, and as it was I figured out a lot of the game play as I went along. But I would still whole heartedly recommend this to anyone, you just have to work a little harder (ie, search the interwebz) to learn to play effectively.<br /><br />I've bought two of the three \\"expansions\\" so far. I hope they come out with more!!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This movie is good for Saturday night. It keeps your interest. However the story is little predictable. I would recommend watching it one time.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I am in agony waiting for Season 2 to be released this September. I don't have cable, so am at the mercy of downloadable episodes. Claire Danes is beyond brilliant.

B000SEI230|5.0|A very easy read and touching book. We should all seek to possess this type of love. This world would be a better place.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best minion game ever!!!!! It takes you into three main parts of despicable me one and two....it is better than temple run
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|IF you enjoy a challenge this game is for you.  I have been playing it for a long time and I love it
B0063IH60K|5.0|When I have time I chill with this app that always satisfies...Try it and you'll be hooked too!  It earns an A plus...
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a really fun racing game to play where you're in a buggy racing on sand and wooden boardwalks around an island avoiding giant crabs, trees, seagulls (okay maybe you're aiming for them) giant head statues, through cave tunnels and other stuff including of course competing vehicles. Graphics are fun and simply amazing, if you're a parent that doesn't like blood in games, then you'll love this one. The game though is primarily you racing against a clock to get to each checkpoint with various very short length of time (30 seconds, 25 seconds).  If you don't make it to the checkpoint in time the race is over.  I would have preferred to be simply racing the other cars. I just find it annoying when you're really getting into the race or want to detour off the fastest racing line and check out some of the cool things (graphics) on the racecourse you don't make it in time and the race (game) is over.  You collect coins along the way by driving through them which allows you to upgrade between games when you have accumulated enough (although you've got to play a lot to accumulate enough to do anything).  You can upgrade your car, change cars, extend the clock by a second, lessen impact when you hit objects on the track and other things like this. Maybe a future edition could have the option of not playing for coins and simply racing around the island, or if you don't make it before time is up for each leg you loose any coins driven through on that leg but you can keep going.  Or you just simply get a higher score for the more time you have left on the clock between legs.  But the fact you have to restart the race every occasion the clock runs out no matter where you are in the race does become annoying and is the main thing holding Beach Buggy Blitz back from being one of the top 5 game apps for the Kindle Fire HD on Amazon. It is seriously fun, but seriously frustrating as well due to the game over when you don't beat the clock design.<br /><br />You can play this game without being connected to Wi-Fi once it is downloaded which is always a good feature.e without being connected to Wi-Fi once it is downloaded which is always a good feature.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is sooo different than what I normally read! I was kinda ify about it but I got sucked in! So much better than the movie!
B009GX69RK|5.0|Not only do you fall in love with the quirky loft dynamic, but you find yourself emotionally invested in the emerging relationship between Nick and Jess. Schmidt starts to really grow on the audience, as well.<br /><br />I would equate my love to New Girl to my love for Sex And The City. I can watch the episodes over and over and over again and I never get bored. In fact, I fall more in love.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game, not like other games this one makes you actually think. Cannot wait for the second one to come out. Will definitely purchase.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Once I finally downloaded the app with Amazon customer service assistance it is easy to use.<br />I know I will enjoy it
B00BYOEMTQ|2.0|What happened??  there was no comparison to the first set of movies, perhaps because Jackson didn't feel as good as he did and the wrangling just to get it made exhausted all the energy that should have went into the movie..not sure.  Animation and special effects were good but that feeling and the meat of the story were nowhere as fulfilling.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Grew up watching these action heroes so who wouldn't want to see them in action again, even if they're 20 years older!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|This movie had great special effects but it was the actor roles that could have, but did not pull it together.  Perhaps it was the lack of depth they were allowed to convey or the parts themselves that were not cast well.  Jack and the Princess just didn't make you want to ride the storyline with them.  Would it have been any better if it was longer.....I'd have to wait for the Director's cut!
B003RUZKC8|5.0|If you don't like this movie, there is something terribly wrong with you.  You need serious professional help.  You need to see a head Doc.
B008G3N71W|5.0|this book took my breath away.  It is not one of those books that just talks about sex, it is a great read.  I enjoyed it immensely.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I liked the book, but I have my doubt about some of the stories told within the pages. Not to take away from a fallen hero, but I found it a little self serving and somewhat distorted. But it was a very good read.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I enjoy the game even though I haven't seen any of the movies except for the original.  The gameplay is easy to pick up and the balance between getting new items for your village and leveling up is just right.  I don't feel like my gameplay is stagnant when there is always something to do in game
B008MM9630|3.0|Haven't played long. Like that the game can be played off-line and have had no crash problem. Haven't run into crystal shortage yet but can see where it could be a problem.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just needed something to entertain my kids in the car or while waiting at the doctor's office.  It has been vastly entertaining for all my children- from the 3 year old up to my 12 year old.  So I am quite happy with it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the whole series of Downton Abbey,  I watched all 3 seasons in about 2 weeks was a wonderful program.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very interesting and well researched A very different story I would recommend this book for its research and story Great
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Interesting read, but again not a must read.  The courage of the protagonist was what made this an interesting read.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|The graphics are neat, but there are only two buttons and all of the fights are the same.  It needs variety.
1451696191|2.0|This book has been on my to read list for the longest time now, and I've been busy with school and life so when I finally got to read it I've been having all these expectations of being entertained, overwhelmed *in a good way* and blown away by what a good book this novel must be. Especially, after having a movie out and the gleaming reviews online. Sadly, my expectations were not met, and I was disappointed.<br /><br />Maybe, I was expecting too much? But, I did not enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. On the plus side, it was an easy, fast and light read for me. It took me a day to finish reading this book because I didn't find it challenging and I was bored. It left a bad after taste though. The characters, the plot, the writing all was underwhelming and could've been much better. I personally believe the writer could've done a better job if he had put more effort into writing this novel. It all seemed so rushed. The ending felt like a last minute after thought that was just thrown there due to a lack of imagination on the writer's part or due to laziness whichever one seems more plausible. The quasi romance between Charlie and Sam seemed contrived and most importantly the characters felt incomplete and I guess that's the major issue this book had, Is that it didn't have strong characters. They all felt very two dimensional at best and very flat. They just never came to life for me. Yes, I understand the book is written in first person and is told by a socially awkward/geeky outcast like Charlie and naturally that might explain why he seems disconnected from everyone around him and the reason behind the characters being so cold and distant but the writing left a lot to be desired and I believe it was the writing's fault more than anything.<br /><br />Charlie is a socially challenged High school student, he starts writing letters to an anonymous sender whom he heard good things about. However, he does not include a return date on the envelop *more like Daddy long legs where Judy Abbott starts writing letters to her anonymous fonder who sent her off to school but doesn't get a reply* except Charlie is doing it by his own well power not because he was conditioned to. In these letters we get to find out about Charlie's life, his school mates, his family and a bit of his past which is disturbing but when you read it in this book it seems very normal and ordinary. This book tackles so many issues that are revolving around teenagers nowadays but with no real depth to any of them. It's almost like they were thrown in there to shock the reader with as many taboos as possible just for the sake of it. Everything seems contrived. The letters serve nothing but a plot device, the relationships between the characters are somehow unreal. Charlie is a Mary sue character, I think the writer was confused as to what he wanted his lead to be? He's not entirely autistic yet he exhibits some symptoms of autism but then again not entirely to be calling him autistic, he's not depressed but appears to be, he wants to make everyone happy and forgets about himself, everyone just loves Charlie! and of course we come to realize why he is the way he is eventually but it just didn't click for me.<br /><br />I won't be picking up this book again, not a horrendous read but I was expecting it to be much much better. Read it and see for yourself I'm definitely in the minority here but I was expressing my Honest Opinion this book was not my cup of tea but it might be yours.<br /><br />Kudos!ddy long legs where Judy Abbott starts writing letters to her anonymous fonder who sent her off to school but doesn't get a reply* except Charlie is doing it by his own well power not because he was conditioned to.

B003WG3218|5.0|Sad to think what Thin Lizzy could have become if they had just survived.  This music is old, but still relevant today.  There is more here than just 'The Boys Are Back In Town'.  It's an excellent album throughout -- every song rocks!
B000IKNZMM|5.0|It was all I expected it would be.  Gives one pause as to what really is the true story.<br />Could this be happening today?

B0000CF35F|5.0|What a fantastic record.  Make's you wonder what would have been in store had Bon Scott survived.  The records that came later with Brian Johnson are Rock & Roll history, but you can see how this one took AC/DC to the next level.

This is an excellent piece of work with anawesome new sound. If I was heading out west with my headphones on....this is what I would be listening to. 5/5 for me. New favorite album.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Watched all of Season 1 in a day, got totally hooked.  Every Season is great, the way they make you fall in love with their characters.  Horrible Season 3 ending, did not see that coming.  Too bad Dan Stevens decided to leave.  I am still eagerly awaiting Season Four
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies from way back. Michael Pare is excellent in this Sci Fi flick, It has a great story line for any Sci Fi lover!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I think about this series a lot. The story may have begun as a comic book series, but it has ended up as a  television classic with elements of post-apocalyptic survivalist tales, Gunsmoke, and the best zombie movies (best because they obey the rules of zombiedom -- will go slow, will eat you, will not die unless brain activity permanently interrupted, etc.) The Gunsmoke connection slowly dawned on me as I tried to figure out why the plot continues to be so compelling in Season 3. Like that series that I grew up on, The Walking Dead has a moral compass in Rick Grimes, but he's updated from Marshal Dillon because his moral dilemmas are seldom so clear cut and he isn't always right. We, and his surviving group, however, can usually agree with him. Or, like his wife Lori, we can say 'We'll go along with you even if we don't agree with you.' And, in Season 3, The Walking Dead took time out to wander off the usual story line into a character-driven episode, connecting us again with a man who was dropped from the script in Season 1. That's when I thought the Gunsmoke connection was real. In order for viewers to stay completely fascinated by The Walking Dead, we need to care about the story, understand the need for characters to come and go, appreciate a good zombie killing fest, and hope the best for the future. I'm with the Marshal . . . er, Deputy Sheriff Grimes all the way.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This thing is great although the Netflix app doesn't &#34;autoplay&#34; the next episode of shows when you use it. I also got it when they were still offering 3 free months of Netflix, so the price was really only $11.  It is so much better using Chromecast to watch Youtube as well, as the &#34;streaming&#34; apps that my bluray has and the tv has are clunky and crappy to &#34;search&#34; for videos on. It is far better to be able to call up the video's on the phone or tablet or computer, and then send them to the tv.<br /><br />This thing is great!!! A Must Buy IMO.

B004ZY0VHY|3.0|This was a difficult book to become engrossed in.  For the first 18 years of her son's life his mother despises him and at times it seems for good reasons.  Then at the end she has a room waiting for him.  Suddenly unconditional love kicks in?  Or does she realize that perhaps the despise she has vented and aloof/disconnected spirit she possess may have influenced her son?  I have to say in the beginning I bought into the \\"bad seed\\" and when she gave birth to her daugther just reinforced it.  However, as she shared more of her interactions with her son and the despise she felt for \\"Americans\\" it made me question that perhaps if she worked on being more of a mother as opposed to taking a free pass how much different Kevin may have been.  It is obvious at the end of the book that despite the connection the mother felt that Kevin had with his father was not there.  But rather it was his mother's love that he sought and it was she who he idealized.  Perhaps that was more so because she didn't offer her love from the beginning.

B001P06GX4|5.0|This game brought back the joy of playing a family board game back. Its great for both young and old and it is a really smart game and you can use either simply strategies to play or think ahead and plan your moves and counter the moves of others. I strongly recommend the game for all. Only thing, for a game that is made of a bunch of plastic pieces, $18 seems like a steep price. And yes, it is easy to lose pieces so keep track of them.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Just boring! The same old , same old the whole time and I felt it wasn't written as well as it should have been. The is too much info on the inmates and nothing about the conditions and treatment.

B00EIL7E9C|4.0|TRUE BLOOD has been my favorite show on TV since its inception. Each year, Alan Ball envisioned another one of Charlaine Harris's books, with excellent results. Season 5 however stopped following the books. Instead, last year initiated characters and plot lines, which season 6 resolves. First of all there's Warlow, a powerful, malicious vampire who killed Sookie's parents, and has a claim on her life. The last episode of season 5 created the character of \\"Billith\\", an amalgamation of the vampire goddess Lilith, and Bill retooled as a religious fundamentalist. Along with Warlow, the other primary antagonist for this season is the vampire hating governor of Louisiana, Truman Burrell. This season introduced some new characters. Fans of the books, will be pleased to learn that the fairy prince Niall, perfectly portrayed by Rutger Hauer (Blade Runner), has escaped from a parallel dimension to aid his grandchildren Sookie and Jason, in their fight against Warlow. While walking to work, Sookie meets Ben, a handsome stranger she develops feelings for. The other storylines include the Billith-Jessica arc, as Bill tries to understand his new godlike powers, and how he is to prevent his vision of the vampire cast members from meeting the sun. Another arc is Eric-Pam-Tara-Nora, all on the run from the genocidal war that Governor Burrell is waging against all vampires. The Alcide-Sam-Emma-Nicole arc revolves around the fallout from Luna's death, Emma's fate, Alcide's role as Pack Master, and the human rights worker Nicole, who quickly replaces Luna, as Sam's new special someone. Last of all, we have the Bellefleur axis (Terry, Arlene, Sheriff Andy and his fairy daughters). Terry still feels guilty from killing his Marine Sargent last season, while Andy's four fairy hybrid daughters create situations as they grow up \\"overnight\\". Finally, lets call Governor Burrell, his girlfriend Sara Newlin, and his daughter Willa, another axis. If all that sounds like a confusing mess, it is.<br /><br />The basic problem with this many story arcs, and character clusters, is how to keep them linked together, however tenuously. Throughout most of the season, you have Sookie, Ben, Niall and Jason exploring the Warlow dilemma, the vampires fighting Governor Burrell in and around the vampire concentration camp, Alcide and the werewolf pack chasing after Sam, Emma and Nicole, and the Bellefleurs worrying about Terry's insanity, and Andy's half fairy daughters. At best you have cohesion during the first and last episodes. Alan Ball's departure from the show, and the trouble finding a suitable replacement, may be partly to blame for the disjointed vibe. This year was said to portray the theme that evil corrupts, embodied by Bill's megalomania caused by wielding Lilith's powers, Alcide's new role as packmaster of the werewolves, and the Governor's power over the world's vampires, and their True Blood supply. However, which year DIDN'T portray the corruption of power? (Marnie, Salome, the Newlins, etc.) My major complaint, was the lack of interaction Sookie had with most the cast, especially Sam, Eric and Tara. Others have had problems with all the strange creatures, like the vampire-god hybrids, fairy-human hybrids, vampire-fairy hybrids, shifter-human hybrids, and shifter-werewolf hybrids. (Yes, these are all in the show this year.) For a show that takes itself so seriously, its become pretty wacky. Of course, the number of episodes was limited to ten, due to Anna Paquin's pregnancy. The tenth episode set up season seven, promising vampire-zombie hybrids, and a symbiotic allegiance between vampires and the human citizens of Bon Temps. Waiting between seasons doesn't suck like it used to.  Let's just hope we don't end up waxing nostalgic for the \\"good ole days\\" of Terry's fire monster.r /><br />The basic problem with this many story arcs, and character clusters, is how to keep them linked together, however tenuously.

Waiting between seasons doesn't suck like it used to.  Let's just hope we don't end up waxing nostalgic for the \\"good ole days\\" of Terry's fire monster.
0470424702|5.0|I love this book because it sets a foundation of understanding and gets right to the important information.  All extra information and rear specifics are placed out of the way for the ease of the current chapter. This is an easy read and is well organized.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Perhaps I should give it more than two stars -- I just anticipated (based on the reviews) that this book would be richer, more interesting, more suspenseful, somehow more insightful than I found it to be. It was a perfectly fine easy read on a rainy Saturday, which was when I read it -- but by the end of the book, everyone's lives are in shambles (or worse) and I found I didn't really care about any of the main characters by that point anyway. I just finished 'And the Mountains Echoed' -- this is more the tenor of the books I usually read, but I do occasionally enjoy the guilty pleasure of a Scott Turow book and I guess this is what I thought I'd get in Defending Jacob. I was disappointed, but perhaps one has to be a parent to identify more closely with the main characters.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I read (and re-read) Jamie McGuire's Providence Trilogy and loved it so I decided to read Beautiful Disaster! Oh boy...I should've read it sooner! It was such an emotional rollercoaster reading about Abby and Travis's romance. Sometimes Travis was a little too obsessive for my taste but overall, great plot, supporting characters, and a whole lot of sexy ;).<br /><br />4.5 stars!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was late getting into Downton Abbey, but so glad I did. The entire family loves the show, even those who are not really traditional television watchers.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is very entertaining and well written. At times it feels more like a feature film then a tv series. The acting is superb. The story is well paced although sometimes a bit slow.  I think the special effects get better as the series went on.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you are a science and history oriented person who also has struggled with making sense of the Christian faith in the 21st Century, then, I think you will love this book. Aslan looks at Jesus as a scholar, and yet he has a gripping writing style that plunges you into the midst of these ancient times. Aslan's scholarship is broad, not narrow, so those with a more contorted, narrow view of Jesus will probably be dismayed. Yet he clearly has mastered the historical Jesus scholarship and gone beyond it. Another strength of Aslan's book is his detailed attention to the cultural and historical accounts of this place and time in the world's history. Historical + Biblical scholarship hold equal weight in this account. I have found almost every page to contain just a slightly different, yet revealing view of the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth. Some of the images descriptions, such as the one of the annual temple sacrifice day early in the book, are so vivid and compelling that your view of those events will be forever changed. He also sees the scriptures as evolving stories, and doesn't hesitate to comment on the probable historicity of this or that Gospel passage: probably pretty accurate for a few, probably just an attempt to establish a truth, rather than report it, for most. I'm still working on this book, and when I finish it, I intend to go back and start at the beginning to read it again.
B0080K3G4O|5.0|The antidote offered by Oliver Burkeman falls somewhere between Stoicism and Buddhism.  He presents his common-sense approach in a comfortable, somewhat remote British voice, careful to fully document and update these old ideas.  It feels as though he is passing on to us ideas that he is also learning.  Since he is not pressuring nor promoting these ideas, one does not feel guilty for disagreeing with him.  However, by the end of the book, the reader will have a hard time disagreeing with Mr. Burkeman and his mentors.  Rather than positive thinking, reality thinking is more comfortable and much more sustainable.  I very highly recommend &#34;The Antidote&#34;.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The app is showing up in the cloud, but will not install back on device.<br />Loved this app enough to pay for it & now can't use it.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|I've loved this movie since it first came out. I purchased it to show my three year old granddaughter. She loves it! Now she asks me if we can watch it together.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|Great addition to my movie collection, together with Russian Dolls, the sequence of this L'auberge<br />I love most the reality of European movies comparing to Hollywood ( nothing wrong with a good ol' American movies)
B00340LM8C|5.0|Great movie with great scenery and a fun story. Great characters too. I would watch it again.  This one is a classic.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book...a journey with a family over time, involving stories within a story.  The author created a word picture of places, life styles unknown to me.  Beautiful  At the end of the book I felt that I had connected with the soul of these people.  .
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|My child loves this app. Kept her attention for awhile. Keeps asking me to play again. Teaches them it's okay to go to the doctor. Would recommend.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is my first Hosseini novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My fellow Metro car passengers got a good look at my tears as I read the ending. Really lovely.
B00DCX08MW|3.0|Great game overall!  Wish the roll and pitch controls were a little more realistic.  Meaning, it would be nice to be able to control a split S or fly inverted but overall not bad.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I first saw this movie in the Theater in Paris in 1989 and it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all time, and it is right up there with Casablanca. The soundtrack is also one of the best of any movie.<br /><br />It's a shame that the US Film Distribution limitations prevented this film from entering the US in the format the director intended. The US version has a horrendous soundtrack and a shamelessly predictable ending in the movie. So, if you ever see the \\"Version Integral\\" in PAL format, or perhaps the Director's Cut, then you are on the right track towards experiencing a film that ensnared an entire Generation of French Youth in the late 1980's, Le Generation Grand Bleu.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Best I've read in a while.<br />Very good stuff. Makes me wish I had an ocean. Hate min. Num. Of words.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|True and shocking reality check of some of the truely horrible things that still take place in the world we live in.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Just over all its a great show. I enjoyed their wardrobe. The story line is easy to follow and you will fall in love with it. Not my favorite ending, but nonetheless a great show.
B004G8ZZHU|5.0|All star cast that pays the right kind of respect to the show while remaining accessible to new viewers.  The movie is non stop action in the 80s tradition.  Watch it!
B008602KQI|4.0|As movies go, it was entertaining but a let down from the book.  Character development in the book was much deeper and more effective.
B00338QENI|4.0|This book holds your interest and want to continue reading with  each chapter. It is well researched and never biased.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Good for Nicholas sparks like the twist as usual by this writer. That's why I read all of his books
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I give the weather 5 stars. It's great. I refer to it every day. It has great videos and helps to plan my day. Thumbs up weather channel.
0345529057|5.0|Awesome books so far (I am almost finished with the 2nd book). The covers of the books look nice. Books were in great condition when I received them. Great deal. I am excited to finish the rest of the series.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|An amazing journey into the heart and mind of an extraordinary man. Viktor Frankl shows his readers how to explore and find the answers we all seek.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I liked this book. It is well written and weird. I couldn't put it down.  I enjoy Neil Gaimans work.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I wanted to be able to find temperatures and weather predictions for international travel.  I think it's supposed to be possible but not able to find how to get this info.
1439156816|5.0|What's not to like? A brilliant writer talks about the craft of writing.<br />He shares the secrets of his success.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|This application is everything I anticipated it would be.  Easy to use, easy to navigate absolutely perfect for foreign travelling.
0525953728|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Couldn't put it down until I was finished.  Very pleased with the product and price.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Honestly, I am too lazy/busy/whatevr excuse to write out a review on any apps I buy. UNLESS it is way way crappy &amp; was high priced (so it made me irritated) OR IF IT IS A &quot;heck yeah!!!! Awesome AND just a buck!!!!!!&quot; App.  THIS IS A GREAT PHOTO EDIT APP! Not complicated to use,actually FUN to use,does everything it says it does! Great!!! This one is easily worth way more than 99 cents! THIS IS THE EASY,FUN,PHOTO EDITING APP YOU'RE LOOKIN' for! Get it!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Firstly, the music hooked me! The graphics are amazing, and the interface is very user-friendly. I think I'll be playing UNO a lot in the future! :D
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Maybe should 've read all reviews closely. The description by the app creators is always \\"WOOHOO WONDERFUL\\" of course. I always decide based on real people reviews if it's worth my money. So 99 cents is still 99 cents and I don't like that I wasted it on this app. NO A.M or P.M option on alarm so no way to set an alarm ahead too far. I haven't figured out yet where THIS MUSIC OPTION I READ ABOUT IS...? There's maybe 10 basic sounds for alarm. Wow. The WEATHER OPTION is VERY BASIC like temp and rain or no rain...Wow. THE OPTION FOR \\"note\\" when alarm goes off better be only 7 letters long because it isn't going to show any more of it. Look,it's just lame and would be fine if free. But nobody put enough thought into creating this app for it to even be 99 cents.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was so emotional. Love the story line and characters.  Can't wait to see the next season in January. Love the house
B007VTUYWW|5.0|I loved this movie. I really like a good syfy movie. I don't care for Angelina Jolie, but she is a great actress. Easy on the eyes to.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved this book. It swallowed me whole from the first until the last line. I was unable to put it down and still dream about Eleanor and Park every night. Rainbow is a fantastic writer with such a unique voice and heartwarming talent. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves love stories that are not about the usual perfect looking couple, glistening all over, and especially for people who appreciate a strong female voice who makes decisions on her own without letting anyone rule their lives. Amazing read!
1594746036|4.0|\\"We cling to our fairy tales until the price for believing in them becomes too high.\\"<br /><br />Jacob has been told fantastical stories his entire life by his grandfather about the orphanage he grew up in and the other children that where in the orphanage with him.  Jacob believed them all when he was young; there were pictures of the children to back up his Grandfathers stories.  But as he grew up the stories faded away into being more myth and fantasy than fact.  Jacob's parents convinced him that his grandfather was not the man Jacob thought he was and the stories were just that...stories.  That is until his Grandfather dies and says some cryptic last words to his favorite grandson.  Jacob is determined to see the orphanage in England for himself and find out if his Grandfathers past is fact or fiction.<br /><br />\\"...so one day my mother sat me down and explained that I couldn't become an explorer because everything in the world had already been discovered. I'd been born in the wrong century, and I felt cheated.\\"<br /><br />I will say this is a very peculiar story indeed.  The cover looks so creepy but this is not really a scary book at all.  As the mysteries unfold the story of the past is brought to light and Jacob must decide where and when he belongs.  The pictures throughout are fantastic and add so much to the story, this is a really original concept.  The love interest is cute and different in so many ways, the idea behind the orphanage the children in it and the monsters that hunt them was a great concept.  There were new discoveries around every corner.<br /><br />If you are looking for something a little out of the ordinary than this is a great break from the norm.  But make sure you get it in a format that you can see the pictures for the book as they add so much to the story.<br /><br /> \\"Because we weren't like other people. We were peculiar.\\"<br />\\"Peculiar how?\\"<br />\\"Oh, all sorts of ways,\\" he said. \\"There was a girl who could fly, a boy who had bees living inside him, a brother and sister who could lift boulders over their heads.\\"bees living inside him, a brother and sister who could lift boulders over their heads.\\"
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing. Wonderful album. I would recommend it to anybody! I can't stop listening to it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are great and a very interesting and unique game!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I'm very confused about the hoopla surrounding this movie and particularly about the oscar nominations.  The acting was fine, but the script didn't call for anything that could be considered oscar worthy.  It seems movies today are either mediocre at best or over the top with special effects...sad.
0307951529|2.0|The book was weak. Great concept but it was nothing but case studies of very similar businesses over and over again, very little gained from reading this book that I didn't already know.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I was not expecting this movie to be this good. I loved it. Just a really fun, light  and entertaining movie. Looking forward to seeing Red 2. Bruce Willis, is great as usual.
B006M9NJFG|5.0|It just works Great and is bigger than the standard GI issue canteen. No leaks or funny taste. I wish the sleeve that holds the canteen had palls webbing but I can get a different sleeve.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Well, he looks cute trotting around the field but I surmise I have to purchase the other options, eg. feeding, grooming, etc. and I have not done this as yet. Personally, I think kids who love horses but don't have one would love it.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|This action adventure movie has some truly funny moments and surprises. Well-acted, well-produced and memorable, with never a dull moment.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|This ap is so confusing & doesn't work!  I got it for the Kindle fire which by the way is the worst device ever!  You can't print!!  Apple products are a million times better.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Dungeon Hunter 4 is a great game if you love an adventurous role-playing game. The graphics and plot are unbelievable. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone.
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|Perhaps in twenty years I will have an 18-year-old son or daughter and they will ask, \\"Dad, can I go to a party?\\" and, not wanting to keep my child from experiences that I was able to have safely, I'll say, \\"Yes, but be home by 12:30\\".  When 12:31 rolls around and my offspring has not returned, I will have to go to that party and embarrass him or her.<br /><br />I pull up to the party house and hear an incredible thumping 4/4 beat muffled behind the front door as the bloodshot eyes of stoned teenagers follow me up the walkway.  Upon opening the door the music escapes and, though concerned about my kid, I can't help but crack a smile as I hear the line, \\"...iiifff there are boun-da-ries, I will try to knock them do-ow-own...\\".  I remember grinding to that one back in the day.<br /><br />I grab a young man by his retro-cool Kanye West vintage t-shirt, \\"Have you seen my kid?\\".  \\"B-b-b-b\\", he tries to spit out an answer, useless. I shove him out onto the dance floor just as the shuffled playlist starts to blare out \\"Stimulation\\".  Damn, I love this track, I want to be on that dancefloor too! Age of consent be damned!<br /><br />In the backyard I saunter through a field of discarded beer cans as the sexualizing cadence of \\"F For You\\" is in full swing.  Under my breath I sing, \\"I've been infected with restless whispers and sheets...\\", as I scan for my lost teenager.<br /><br />Back in the house I'm in the back bedroom where young men and women are expelling copious amounts of now-legal marijuana from their lungs. \\"Has anybody seen-\\" before I can finish I am cut off by a dude with a pierced skull, \\"Close the door old man.\\" I get right up in the teen's face, \\"Old man!?!?! You hear that song playing, 'Defeated No More'? I used to grind up on my wife to that song, I know whats up!\\"<br /><br />I start to worry, kind of, not really.  More I don't want to leave.  Especially now that \\"Help Me Lose My Mind\\" is playing.  Fudge it, I think to myself, I'm doing this.  I take a rip and a shot for myself and hit that floor hard.  Halfway through \\"White Noise\\", as I'm fantasizing about Aluna Francis while I freak-dance a couch with a lampshade on my head I hear, \\"Dad?\\".  Oh boy, now I've got some explaining to do.<br /><br />As me and my embarrassed child leave this rager, I stop him or her for a second and say, \\"Wait a minute...there is something I need you to know.\\"  I don't know what life-lesson he or she is expecting, but all I say is, \\"this song rules, let's go back in...\\" because it's \\"Confess to Me\\" featuring Jessie Ware before she became a stadium-filling diva.<br /><br />This allegory serves to convey the timelessness of \\"Settle\\" by Disclosure.  The way dance floors still go ape when tracks from \\"Thriller\\" or \\"Homework\\" or \\"Substance (1987)\\" come on, thus will be the case with tracks from this gem.  Much like Basement Jaxx, Disclosure blend house/techno with pure pop using a stable of vocalists.  Their choices are so broad and relevant that it really makes \\"Settle\\" one of the ultimate sign-of-the-times albums of the era.

B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|My friend Gemma and I love the music done by Owl City, with the blend of techno and instrumental music, and the lovely vocals from Adam Young. I bought this as a gift to Gemma, and we both loved the tracks!<br /><br />While I'm not sure if I would call it &#34;Acoustic&#34; in the traditional sense where the music only uses vocals and an acoustic guitar as it is more of a calmer version of some older songs. But whatever you call it, everything in this album sounds prettier and matches the mood, especially Gold and Shooting Star!<br /><br />I definitely recommend fans of Owl City and anyone else who loves keyboard music or soft techno to buy this album!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie.This movie kept you on the edge of your seat Wait until you see the punch line!
0618871713|5.0|This book is a slow-building, somber story set far away from anything. The writing and drawings are directly to the point. There's no glossiness or romanticism in this story. Maybe that's why it's often so painful and so seemingly true to life. Regardless of your background, you WILL relate to this story and cringe when you remember your own moments of youth.<br /><br />I will say, Alison Bechdel, the writer, is smart. Very smart. Did you get that? You better study up on your literature and modern thought before reading this or a lot of it will go zooming over your head and into oblivion (or, if you're like me, it'll renew your desire to crack open some Fitzgerald or Proust and realize what you've been missing).<br /><br />Anyway, this book is highly recommended and a must-read, as cliche as that sounds. There are more sighs than laughs in this book, but you really feel each detail in every page, every word, has a purpose for being there, and a deep meaning. It's very nuanced.<br /><br />But for real, a must-read.
0756655307|4.0|I got this book for my 11 year old boy.  He loves it.  I managed to sneak it away from him for a moment to catch up on the Marvel universe.  I have to say the kid in me enjoyed this as well.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|This is a must read for every small business person who really thought they were entrepreneurial. Michael really dissects what the E-word really means.
B009WUBERW|3.0|This is no movie worthy of an Oscar or any other type of award, but it managed to fit in a Chuckism for the win.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|his first album was fantastic.  this one could h ave a little more &#34;blues&#34;. just did not seem to my ear as good as his first but i do wish him well with it.
B002C6A6N6|2.0|Three episodes are completely unwatchable due to laser disc problems.  Very very sad, since as a 77 year old woman I love Dr. Quinn so much.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I really liked this movie and so did my daughter. It is definitely intended for kids and everything is from a kids viewpoint, but it is entertaining enough for an adult to watch as well.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Honest but to much Pete and not enough the actual music. Would have liked to hear more about your personal road and studio guitar tech, those intimate logistics. So glad Pete mellowed to be such a good, actually wonderful man.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I'm not a geek so I can't give any technical info. I just know how easy this is to use and how much room this app gives me on my Kindle. This is really worth installing and using. Love it.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Good origin story not bogged down with needless action or bad script writing. Entertaining even if you're not a fan of the Star Trek Universe.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Just one of the classics of SciFi that everyone should read.<br /><br />My only complaint might be that the author does not come from a technical background, and therefore, is is not hard science fiction.  But the story is great and meaningful, and I will read it again some day I'm sure.
B00A7CF1QY|3.0|What can I say?It wasn't what i was expecting from a &#34;Bourne&#34; movie. The action sequences were flat and I felt like I'd seen them before. The editing made each fight underwhelming at best. It got Three stars because it would have been a decent action movie on its own but as a follow up to the previous films its just so so. It reminds me of Quantum of Solace. It wasn't really a 007 movie. It felt like a cheap Bourne knock off. Sadly, Legacy didn't even leave me with that.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|The game is ok. Its very easy in the beginning and gets hard quickly. Not quite what I had expected.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode ends with a cliff hanger making you rush to the next one!!! It is sooooooo good this season!!
B0071MQBX0|5.0|We've seen Phantom on stage several times and this is fantastic!!!!  I wish I could give it 6 stars.  If you like the stage version, you will love this.  The extra surprise at the end of the show made it all the better.  It was like being in the theater audience.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I grew up with this cast of characters and I enjoy them as much if not more than any of their later counterparts.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|It does what I need but I find the other Flasher settings useless. They should've given it degrees of brightness instead
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love British History even if it is put in a soap opera type show.<br />I love all the characters
B000SEFCD8|5.0|I never expected a book on animal behaviorism to be so interesting. I finished and started over again immediately even though I have a fine memory, just for the pleasure of reading the stories. For those people who claim that it isn't a dog training book, well it isn't primarily written for that purpose, but if you do not pick up several excellent tips well worth the cost of the book, you are not a very perceptive reader.<br />One of the most charming books I have ever read, and that in spite of my pathological dislike of apes whose behavior is deeply explored alongside that of dogs. Traumatized by the flying monkeys in The Wizard of Oz at an early age, it takes a lot of skill to draw me in despite that. Highly recommended to intelligent and curious dog lovers who wish to communicate more clearly with their pet.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|So easy to use its just like going on the computer and not to mention but you do get all the stuff for desktop
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|An interesting take on the Arthurian legend done with a young cast. Definitely worth a look as it was well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it took long to convince me to read it, but I am so glad I did. great book, and highly recommend the whole trilogy
B00B5A9FLY|3.0|Not the best of all the seasons. The passage of time was poorly done and the end wasn't very satisfying even though you knew they would die way too young.
B000001F76|5.0|this is the apex of country music as it was intended to be written, played and sung about. the is no noise, claptrap or other interferences, just plain goo old country music at its best.
B004RCUJ9E|4.0|It was so easy to download since im new at using kindle fire.. and a lot of fun.. I like the technology
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I love this series! I am addicted, I will be sad when it is over.  Great writers, great actors, genius.
B003TQ50V6|5.0|I have seen it at least four times, and will continue to watch it over and over again.  Compares to any John Wayne movie
B0035XTV22|5.0|tho very pornographic, I liked it because of the coolness of Katherine.<br />The first time I watched it the ending is a huge surprise
B0000542D2|5.0|What can I saw? The Beatles, biggest Rock n' Roll band in history! First with music videos. Simply the best!
B00005JOFQ|5.0|It is not for youngsters in my opinion. It shows the many sides and emotions involved in a love relationships between 2 men, as well as the young ladies they end up marrying and how it effects all the people involved. Parents, children, spouses....and each other employment.  If you watch this and feel nothing I fear that you likely are heartless or dead.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The device itself is fine. But it's hard to just review this without reviewing the apps that partner with it. The Netflix app seems to freeze up a lot. The Google apps work fine. Would like to see more apps take advantage down the road.
0679804021|5.0|I purchased this for my high school students with intellectual disabilities.  This adapted version offers short chapters, simplified text and pictures to aid comprehension.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Always have liked this grouping of Star Trek episodes.<br />Gets better over time as the actors became more at ease in their roles.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|It kept my attention for hours It is fast and fun. The only problem was in the later stages of the game when it is supposed to be fast my kindle would freeze up for a few seconds. Otherwise I would recommend the game. I liked a lot.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|can play for short times or long.  keeps my mind active and at same time can be relaxing.  would reccomend to anyone.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love it, SOA is the best show they have ever made ...Jax is hot, the show is so real
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I use this for doubling my recipes or triple it if I need to. It is an awesome app and well worth the .99 cents. I find I use it for a lot of things because it is very accurate.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfurers is a good game suitable for all ages so anyone that gets this app will probably enjoy it
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Games of this caliber is what I had hoped for when I first got my Kindle. Graphics are stunning, daily rewards keep you coming back for more, and the gameplay is smooth and rewarding.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like this game but some are a real puzzler. They really make you think about what the answers could be.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|A fun read, though felt a bit contrived after awhile.  Did not see all of the large cast of characters through to conclusion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun. More levels please. Awesome app. Download and try it out. You will have a blast playing this. Fun fun fun. Five stars
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|a masterpiece. historical, hilarious and full of humanity. characters and conversations are fully developed, a snapshot in time. a must read, every fe.com.comw years.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|His game is pretty righteous and i dont like card games that much so if u do i would imagine you'll like it
B001UGB1X8|3.0|TLJ is good in whatever he appears in. While I enjoyed him in this film, he's had better movies, such as The Fugitive..
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Hard to put down, such an interesting way of writing. Makes you need to get the next one so you know what is going on.
0743270754|4.0|To some extent, the accomplishment of finishing this book is as rewarding as the actual content.  In my opinion, you can get most of the relevant content in about 10 chapters with the rest just offering a thorough examination of the lives of Lincoln and his cabinet.  With that said, all the slower seemingly irrelevant content always comes back around and you're left with a complete view of all characters.  My only criticism of the author is that at times there were transitions that were clunky and left you wondering which cabinet member she was talking about.  It can be a bit dizzying because there are so many characters, but you really begin to understand each of them and get a view into their motivation and how they viewed one another.  This is not a read for the faint of heart, if you're not prepared to dedicate effort to push though some of the slower portions, you'll be frustrated with how difficult it is.  However, if you take your time and let yourself get to know the characters, you'll enjoy the book.  It took me a while to get to that point (about 1/3 of the way in) but once I got into them one by one, it was really rewarding.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have an I phone I canylt find diamond easliyplz fix it cause it really bug me and awesome game
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is so addicting!!! I went looking for a game and this game pops up. I thought I'd try it. I was like wow this is awesome! Get this game if u have free time and need something to do.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Movie is a bit slow, but I enjoyed the music and anything with Maggie Smith will get min. 3 stars from me.
B003M30T9Y|5.0|Every track's great. I never find myself skipping any of the songs. Nothing's filler. The orchestral bits could've been a tad louder though.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. (It was part of our book club selections) I found it similar to The Shack by William Paul Young but this story is the real life account of a person's actual experience during a 7-day coma. I found it compelling that the person recounting this wildly unexplainable and spiritual experience is also as steeped in science as any human could be. A medical professional, and a neurosurgeon no less. It's as if he was chosen to experience what he did because he's so uniquely qualified to evaluate it and see it objectively. In any case, I liked the book and it's definitely thought-provoking.
B005HED08I|5.0|This show is legendary for so many reasons! It has inspired so many people over several generations! I love Star Trek.
B004IK8PLE|4.0|The first few chapters were a difficult read, but the book became more compelling as I read more.  The explanation of the German Enigma machine is extremely well done. It covers historical ciphers well, but misses recent ciphers (AES, ECC) and programs like GnuPG while covering quantum cryptography.  Worth the read if you are looking for an understanding of the historical background of codes and ciphers.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I enjoyed the special effects and the different \\"spin\\" on this old tale. It helped that I read about the differences before I watched it, otherwise it might not have made sense. It wasn't out on Netflix yet so I'm glad I found it on Amazon.
B001609SQA|5.0|One of the best action sci-fi movies ever made. It's still smart, the characters still resonate and there are only a few moments that have become hokey over the years.
159448385X|5.0|Wow, what would I do and how would I feel being in the position the women in this book where put in. It is a story of selflessness and friendship that I hope to never have to be put in. The culture and the requirements of women are really something this book had me thinking about a lot.  I felt connected to them as I read the book and I was cheering for them as I read. Again, I cried at the end. Bitter-sweat. A story of love and longing for love and freedom. A must read if you liked kite runner.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this a wonderful game for horse lover's of all ages it is a lot of fun to take care and ride your horses it would be cool if you could breed your horses and train the foal
0307276902|2.0|I only read this book because of all the &#34;hype&#34; about it. I found a lot of the things in the book just too hard to believe as true. I also did not like the repetition of words. I guess it was for emphasizing but it just kind of got on my nerves. I wish the story could have been true as I wanted to get a good sense of what it is like to be an addict and to overcome it as everyone in my family but myself is n addict. I was thinking I could get a little insight into what they feel and why it is so hard to overcome. His stories of the dentist where just so out there and it was easy to know there was no way any dentist would do the things he describes. Good luck to mr. Frey and prayers for continued sobriety for him.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved the Iron Man movies and this really topped the series.  Loved it. Will watch again and again.  great action
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This video empowers the consumer to make better food purchases. For ground beef, I'll avoid the &#34;ammonium hydroxide&#34; meat filler and choosing to have the butcher grind a grass-fed or organic roast for me instead.  My daughter who is vegetarian now has a stronger argument for eating less meat.<br /><br />Chickens are being treated with antibiotics, cows are covered in resistant e-coli, but corporate America is consolidating with organic companies in response to our food dollars. GMOs aren't tolerated in Japan and a host of other countries, but the FDA is okay with turning Americans into lab rats!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is extremely fun and very addictive!  The only negative is if your game freezes, then you lose any credits you may have earned during play but otherwise l highly recommend this game!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My husband enjoyed these as much as I did. Very worthwhile investment. i believe we will enjoy  these again sometime.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|It is wonderful to read a brave woman's story. Her writing style is easy to read and the story is very well written
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|If you read the book series you may find it hard to adjust to Tom Cruise in the lead role. If you haven't read any then it was a ok rental if you like action movies.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Very additive app. Love playing kid games like this as a adult. These games arnt just for kids. Love different fish.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I actually watched this two times. I liked the pace and the characters of the movie. Great rental wish I caught it on the big screen.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Love this app, so much easier than the official website. Use it all the time. You tube is awesome. Even on my t.v.
B00881VLCE|4.0|It's a great app to have when your looking for something different to do.  There is a good amount of puzzles. (20) but I wish there were more.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8yr old and 5yr old love it. Cant get them off of it. I even play it. Great game.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|How many times have I heard &#34;don't judge a book by its cover&#34; yet I saw the cover and put in back on my &#34;virtual bookshelf&#34; because it just didn't look interesting.  Boy was I wrong.  The story I read is one that I know I will perpetually think about for months maybe even years to come.
1601251505|5.0|I have played and DM'd RPG games for 20 years.  I remember the Red Box of D&D and AD&D (Thac0), from 3.0 to 3.5 Forgotten Realms, Dark Sun, and Ravenloft to Planscape.  I had gotten tired WoTC continually changing the Rule Edition and took a 4 year break.<br /><br />Pathfinder took the 3.5 rules and improved / tweaked them.  I call it 3.75 and I Love It.  Paizo has taken 99% of the gray out of the rules and made them as simple as rolling a d20.  It is compatible with the 3.5 RPG campaign settings and easily converts one to the other, either way.  It also has fantastic Artwork in each Chapter as explained below.<br /><br />This book starts out with an Introduction and segways into Chapter 1:  Attributes, giving an easy to understand summary of each attribute and how it benefits each core class.  Attributes are your Strength, Dexterity, Constitution [health], Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma.<br /><br />Chapter 2 is Core Races.  A very easy to read and understand (for beginners and veterans alike) chapter explaining all the information of each race, from Dwarf to Half Orc.<br /><br />Chapter 3 is Character Classes.  These are your roles in life.  DO you want to be the brave Warrior or the Raging Barbarian, or the Studious Wizard, A stealthy devious Rogue or the Holy Cleric (or evil Cleric), or the Studious and Magical WIzard and Sorcerer; Maybe the Nature Loving Druid or Ranger.  Its all simply explaiuned in detail.<br /><br />There are several other chapters dealing with Skills, Feats, Equipment, Combat, Spells, Magical Items, etc.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone looking to start out fore the first time in the Pathfinder Campaign Setting, or looking to expand your horizons in RPGs.<br /><br />Thanks and I truly hope you enjoy this as much as I have.<br /><br />You can also check to see if game stores in your area have organized Pathfinder RPG Events by going to [...]  SImply put in your zip code and search for local events.
B00992CF6W|5.0|YOU SHULD REALLY DOWNLOAD THIS APP BEST GAME IN THE GALIXY well minecraft pc is better but this app is still awesome
B009RH9HDS|4.0|The product does what it promises thought the spinning mechanism starts pretty tight and makes you think you might break it when you first turn it. You do have to turn it to expose the cord input so you can charge it closed and then move it back to get it to set up with the camera properly. My old case had a whole located in the hinge that allows for cord access. That is my only complaint as long as it doesn't deteriorate in 6 Mo.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I bought the game for my son to play.  IT is too fast and there is no way to slow it down or replay the tutorial for him to learn how to play.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Kingdom of Heaven is one of my favorite movies. I am totally satisfied with the quality of the CD I bought
B000P0J0EW|5.0|As the title said this is my favorite movie of all time. There is not much more I can say about it because every time I watch it, it leaves me speechless. If you have not seen it add it to your cart right now, no scratch that get a digital copy so you can watch it right NOW. Really do it you will not regret it.
B003U0AHBO|5.0|Great - thanks, will order more stuff in the future, very satisfied with the purchase. I give it a five star rating
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy playing like watching chats and talking with other players from all over the world.  Seems to have glitches but they usually are corrected.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I couldn't find my phone so my daughter set this up on my Kindle and it worked great!  Now I have two alarms available!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app. Especially to be free. It's very useful and works well on my KINDLE FIRE Hd.
B000002ADT|5.0|Wonderful a classic I've loved it for years !  Its a classic of Bill Evans as well as all the other icons on this album !
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book was a good read. You could easily distinguish it was written for a teenage audience, but the storyline was quite intriguing. I had moments where I just had to read on to find out what happened next. The characters were very loveable as well. I don't read much, but I finished it in two days. Good read that kept me on the edge, for sure!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Utilitarian Bush Knife, tackles most hunting and camp chores with aplomb, made in U.S.A.  If You need A heavy duty partner
0738737909|5.0|I have been a Tarot devotee for the past 25 years and consequently have collected dozens of beautiful decks over the years to use in readings as well as to admire for their artistry. Nothing quite prepared me for the spectacularly beautiful deck that the Tarot Illuminati is! It is a sumptuous feast for the eyes. I am working with it on a daily basis since ordering a few weeks ago and continually marvel at the way the images have been rendered. The print quality of the deck is top notch and I love the gilded edging of each card. The deck is solid, easy to shuffle and feels like the substantial and high quality production that it is. It has become my \\"new\\" favorite deck to work with AND to admire. In fact, I plan to order another deck solely for the purpose of display. My compliments to the artist, Erik C. Dunne for his exquisitely conceived renderings of ALL the cards, my particular favorites being ALL of the Major Arcana and the Court Cards! I also enjoy very much the way that Kim Huggens has written her interpretations of each card as her descriptions are imaginative, dramatic and also in keeping with the essential meaning of each card. I suppose if one were to criticize this deck in any way, it might be the deck's \\"in your face\\" use of color! Frankly, I find it positively resplendent but some might take issue with the fact that the colors might have been used more judiciously as they correspond to the essence and quality of each suit. If you \\"know\\" Tarot however, I question whether it will bother you. I have become fully immersed in Dunne's one-of-a-kind deck and believe you will too! Take the \\"Fool's plunge\\" and purchase this deck!! You won't be disappointed.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Gave this product to my cousin's son so he can have endless hours of fun, great toy for a young developing mind
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought Hunger Games and a friend lent me the other two.  I have to say I LOVED Catching Fire.  Mockingjay was good but I liked Catching Fire and Hunger Games better.<br /><br />There's a saying, \\"Nothing new under the sun.\\"  I did find a movie based on a book that is very similar to Hunger Games called Battle Royale which was published before Hunger Games.  Same idea:  Children made to fight to the death.  Only one survivor.  One young couples refuses to kill and survive at the end.  Hmmmmmmmm.  They even had a Battle Royale 2.<br /><br />Overall, HUNGER GAMES was way more awesome.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I was expecting the worst. But I have to admit that I enjoyed this book a lot more than I thought I would have. The Vegas thing is so cliche but the characters are real and their emotions are too. Somehow the author made it all believable and wonderfully romantic. Thumbs up!
B000002ADT|5.0|Great Music from the great Mile Davis; however the mastering of this recording to CD results in rather poor sound quality. There is a high level of overall hiss throughout the entire recording.
B002PJ8AE2|5.0|This car has been through the wringer with my two granddaughters.  The car has raced down stairs on makeshift ramps, been pulled down the long driveway by strings behind their bicycles, and a million other abuses as well.  The car is oh so cute, and in the 8 months since Christmas it has managed to withstand all the imaginative play little girls can dream up.  Hope you are as satisfied with your purchase as I was with mine.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Such a &#34;beautiful&#34; film...The love this man has for his film is so unreal.  It makes tear up every time I watch it!
B00BRH2MN8|4.0|Great new music from what i hope is an up and coming artist. I am awaiting to hear more from her as she matures and evolves.<br />FYI Royals is a great brain worm.
B007AL48UK|5.0|I like mahjong, but some are too much trouble for a novice, like me.  I love how it reshuffles when you run out of moves.  It lets you finish the game.  The colors and themes are a plus.  Love the summer theme!  I might even get some of the other themes because this particular mahjong game is so nice.  If you want mahjong for your kindle, this is the one to get!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Just love bingo blitz!!!<br />This is the best bingo game ever so much fun an  lots of options<br />Come HAVE some fun see what everyone is talking about and good luck
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|I saw it in the theater, and again now, over six months later. Two main things it accomplishes. It raises awareness of the 13th Amendment and how difficult it was to get it passed. Second, it gives a good glimpse of Lincoln, who he was, his use of stories and humor, and the weight of the pressures that being President was for Lincoln, all in the context of being enjoyable as a story. I can see myself seeing it yet again.
0553801473|4.0|I absolutely love Game of Thrones.  I love the rich characterization and made-up history.  I love that Martin keeps surprising me.  And he managed to do that yet again, a few times, in book 5.  I loved it!<br /><br />That being said, I feel like George is spreading himself a bit too thin.  I managed to work my mind around book 4 and book 5 being parallel stories, but the fact is, there just might be too many characters to keep track of.  Though the story is rich and varied, the overall timeline of the story advances very little in this book.  We visit our favourite characters very seldom, making room for ever more new faces and their own baggage.  And can we say cliffhangers?  I estimate about the last 10 chapters end in serious unresolved problems!<br /><br />Perhaps this is just great strategy on George R. R. Martin's part.  After all, I'm joining my voice with the masses of anxious fans asking \\"When?\\"  Hurry up, please, Mr. Martin!  We can't wait for book 6.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is wonderful.  We use this every night as a sleep aid.  Thanks!  Wouldn't make it through the night without it.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very nice product. Good quality. The size and number of the compartments inside can be customized. It do have got a tripod carrier on its side. I would recommend this product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best ever. I just wish I had more time to play it. never gets old. fantastic.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I downloaded this game and did enjoy it.  There is a lot of peripheral stuff going on including a chat window you can't close even if you disable chat. If you play more than one card, they are very small. I don't quite understand the point of the chatting nor the coins, the powerups, collecting of symbols or the slot machines it takes you to, as none of it seems to translate to game tokens. I downloaded this game four days ago and played an average of maybe 30-40 minutes a day and got a Bingo exactly twice, winning game tokens each time . However, now I have run out of tokens and the only way to replenish them is to buy them, which I'm not going to do. So unless they replenish themselves, looks like I am out of luck.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I've had this app for a long time, and I love it! I use a kindle fire and I love this app, it has an option to download file as an mp3 and after it downloaded it goes straight to my music library.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This story captures the essence of a struggle for power and how it affects the lives of those involved both directly and indirectly. The setting is a fantasy realm but it could be our own medieval time period. What makes the saga are the characters and how each of them deal with larger events surrounding them. You are caught up in their lives and you can't wait to see what happens next. A must read.
0760703329|5.0|It came a bit late but it came in great condition! The book was much bigger than expected! Love it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It's like a hack wrote a knockoff. Don't bother with it. It's not true Sookie. I don't know who wrote this but it doesn't seem like it was Charlaine Harris.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Rawlings writes about real people, with all their illusions, unfulfilled hopes, hurts and self deceptions,as well as their skills, intelligence and compassion.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it because is very addictive, is real and you can play online with your friends at the same room. Is my preferred game.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love the game but am sick and tired of buying chips and coins and never getting them. And they wont respond back
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved all the books. COuld have stopped at 3 for a happily ever after but am excited for book 6.<br />Movie was excellent. Love Magnus!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I have always been interested in the history in biblical times....not the religious story, but the historic story of things.  This book is well researched and written and fascinating.  For the first time I feel I am getting a true picture of what times were like during the life of Jesus.  Well done!
B004C4IKCU|5.0|It is over half a century ago since I bought &#34; Elvis Is Back &#34; the vinyl l.p.edition.<br />And it is with great pleasure that I can add the Legacy Edition to my collection.<br />Together with the &#34;Something For Everybody&#34; album it is such a pleasure to be<br />able to play it in my car or anywhere.<br />First class presentation. Love it.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Execellent writer.  She combines history with fiction, keeps one turning the page.  One doesn't want to put the book down.  I read all of her books
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|I now have the original dbl.l.p. issue, the d.v.d box set and now the Legacy Edition.<br />My Aloha collection is now complete.<br />Thanks.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Kind of fun. Clear delination between the good and the bad. Kurt Russell is a good fit for this role. The story line is not bad either.
B00DD1X99C|5.0|This is a must have for every serious collector. Two beautiful and heavy vinyl albums.<br />With most material new and unheard I am proud to add this to my large Elvis collection.<br />This is the first new vinyl I have seen in years. And I have about 650 records and c.d's<br />from Elvis.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Magical Realism at its best! While it may seem somewhat disjointed initially, it all comes together if you stick with it. Beautiful language, sympathetic and 3 dimensional characters - I didn't want it to end! The movie is also extremely well made.
0143122916|4.0|Shocking. Happy to hear author escaped he only did what he had to do to survive this horrible nightmare thank you
B005LAJ16I|4.0|Well written, well performed, well filmed and edited with an excellent pace. Very entertaining. What more could you ask for?
B006P4HFH6|5.0|One of my favorite subjects in the world has got to be haunted houses. I don't mind the blood and gore that comes with a good haunted house story and I don't mind if there is no blood or gore just psychological scariness. Luckily for me this series is jam packed full of both. There are so many twisty turny surprises and when you think you have something figured out you are usually proven wrong. There is blood and gore and horrifying things in almost every episode. This is definitely not a series to watch with your kiddoes but I am thoroughly thrilled that the creator's did not hold back - they show the stabbings, shootings, blood spatter, body parts and best of all Dylan McDermott's naked hiney.<br /><br />I am fascinated by this series and watched it all myself and am now making my husband watch it with me. I watched the first season on Amazon Prime but will probably pay the $20 for the second season when we are done with this one. I would recommend this for the drama lovers that don't have weak stomachs, for the scary movie buffs and especially for the haunted house fans - no kids though!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I always love to see this movie again, and this version has excellent picture quality. The sound wasn't bad either, though there's not much you can do for a movie that is tis old.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|This is an awesome movie with a fantastic ending.  Greating acting and special effects; thoroughly enjoyable.  I would watch this movie more than once.
1591841666|5.0|A little book that teaches you when to quit!<br /><br />What a wonderful concept because we are told over and over again that we should not quit.<br /><br />I mean really we have all seen the picture of the frog in the birds mouth with it's hands on the birds neck with the line \\"Never Quit!\\" Is that really good advice? Seth Godin tells us it is not in this easy read that imparts knowledge we already knows but backs up the knowledge with stories of those who actually quit and never looked back.<br /><br />Godin helps us to focus our energy where we can make a difference and know when we have to push through the pain, or know when it is time to step away.<br /><br />This is a must read for everyone to help them see their fullest potential as a person, be that in business or just to be the best of who they are!<br /><br />Godin gives us nuggets of wisdom to help us see our true potential, find the thing we are personally, or our business is, best at and bring it to the next level of changing the world.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Excellent, nice pictures easy to use.. works well with weather app.  Especially like the multiple alarms and cities. Good job.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|As a former English teacher, I kept thinking how wonderful it would be to read this book with teenagers. The characters are engaging, the writing witty and SMART.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|You can't beat the price. The discs are just that, discs. There's none of the original artwork or anything. Overall it's simply a generic set of the albums listed. The recording is good quality. Good buy!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|I often am unable to get my content to load. I can get it to load on another Android Tablet device so I know it isn't because YouTube is down. Very disappointing.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Game tokens need to be easier to acquire and plentiful!!!! Special cards should be filtered next to each other so they can stand out easier when you have a large hand......
B00498YZFK|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress , actually I think everyone who was in this movie did a great job on the roles!
1439192812|5.0|I love introducing my kids to reality and this book does an outstanding job of facilitating that. Adults and children will live this amazing book with its impeccable illustrations and valuable information. I'll be buying more for gifts!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The style of this was very simple, like listening to a frightening yet brave story told by a &#34;good ole boy&#34;.  Mr. Kyle shared many specific details about his military life as a sniper, but the details were essential in order for one to visualize and understand his experiences.  His wife's comments allowed me to better understand the ones who love and wait for our deployed soldiers.  My sincere and deep respect for those who serve in the military, especially those in combat, has increased.  Unfortunately, Chris Kyle was killed recently while working to assist other veterans.  My heart is broken for his family, and for the Americans who will never be able to thank him personally.  God bless those who serve!
B00DHNB5CY|3.0|My husband wanted me to finish the series of Evil Dead.  Cult classic knock off but did have a few &#34;jump out of your seat&#34; moments.
B00C68JXAW|4.0|One of the best 007 movies ever. I think it doesn't get the recognition is deserves. Blu-ray makes a big difference.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|For. passing time in the doctor, or waiting in a bank line, or in some concentration time at the bathroom, is the best thing to have on your tablet or mobile phone.
B001ECPJZO|2.0|I received this fast but I was truly disappointed when I opened the box and found a much smaller box inside. I should have read the description of the item closer but the picture looked like what I was looking for.This shoe is only approx. 3&#34; in size. I expected a bit larger for preschool age kids. this is so small i'm sure he will not have fun or an easy time lacing & unlacing as he seems to love to do. I was surprised due to the price of the item thinking it was of a substantial size for preschooler to play with and learn with. It was my fault for not reading the description closer. It looks like it is a nicely made item though.
0140177396|1.0|The book was completely filled with highlights, and notes written on every single page..I've bought many used books before, but this one should of been trashed, wasted money on shipping...Big Joke
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|Beautiful! A collectible moment in music history worth every penny. The main concert especially was filmed in decent resolution so the conversion to bluray looks great! The Live Aid concert is not a clean in resolution but that's just how it was filmed. Still an AMAZING clip to own so it doesn't effect my rating at all. It's Freddie!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Can't wait until the next game is out. Lots of puzzles, you won't want to put it down. Wish it would have been a little longer storyline but the time they put into the puzzles sure showed. Very nice graphics and perfect background music, wouldn't change a thing there. Thanks!!
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|This is another one of my favorite movies with John Wayne.<br />Not very accurate historically, but that doesn't matter when you take into consideration<br />who stars in it. I love James Caan's early performance as &#34;Mississippi.&#34;
B003CHGV74|5.0|I have heard so much about Breaking Bad but never watched it. It is so different than any show I have ever seen. Very gritty, to say the least. I love it and am looking forward to watching the rest of the seasons
B0045HCJSK|5.0|This is one of my favorite John Wayne movies. I used to have it taped on VHS, but now<br />I don't have a VHS player so needed a DVD.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|It wasn't as good as some other Salon games I've seen for children. I don't really have anything else to say.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Bought this DVD to replace the first one we bought because this is a family favorite movie. Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This movie will expose the truth of our food supply, how you are being misled.  In the large food industries profit is more Importiant then your health.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Pretty good movie. I like that the plot changes towards the end. Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman should do more work together.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Yesterday I receviced this device. I configured this chormecast device using my Iphone 5, I see in reviews that not many were able to configure it using iOS , i think they didn't switch it to chormecast wifi during configuration. Youtube works flawlessly without video buffering unlike my samsung smart tv which always buffers. Its one of the best innovvation from google, hats off to them for making it available for just 35$. Can't wait the Beta feature of chorme tabcasting to work nicely, i could see stutterring of video's from my win 7 core duo laptop when i do the tabcasting. I just anticipate lots of other companies start supporting chromecast with there apps in android and iOS platform.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very well written and insightful.  I feel like I have learned something about the meaning of life and of death by reading this book.
0770437400|5.0|If you are looking for the action movie, go see the movie. If you are looking for a well thought-out, interesting read, then I recommend this.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|This movie was awesome! It had a lot of action and an actual story. The whole family can watch this.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Without getting deep, there aren't any skip worthy tracks and about 4 repeatable ones. Cop it if you're into tightly weaved beats and ideas.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mr Weir writes my kind of science fiction... straightforward plot; a likable, intelligent central character facing insurmountable odds; lots of hard science; and plenty of suspense right up to the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.  I could not put it down. Told friends about it. They downloaded and it drove them nuts. Thanks.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I watched this as a precursor to going and seeing part 2 with my daughter as I hadn't seen it yet. It's a great story with humor that transcends age. It has memorable characters and events; I'd recommend this movie to anyone!
B00000634J|4.0|John Lennon's Legend is an album that must be included in every music library. Contains some of the songs that made him a living legend.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Get a hot cup of tea and a good hearty snack, sit in your most comfy chair with a soft blanket and settle into this most beautifully rendered movie of middle earth. You'll feel right at home in the Hobbit's cozy, welcoming home under the hill. The men who gather there for adventure eat and laugh and sing their deep low song of mournful history so you want to just jump in and join them. It is so exciting and good for the heart to see Baggit (spelling?) the dear peaceful, happy to be bored Hobbit, embrace courage and go the extra mile as he grows to show such bravery and consistant devotion to the King in the group. He is not trying to be a hero, but falls into that position over and over and rises to the occasion. The filming is extraordinary and gruesome and just awe inspiring. You'll be so happy you have it in your library if you get it. Wow~~~!!!  Connie
B00CJGP116|5.0|Wow! after listening to the whole album, I must say this is by far the best Marc Anthony recording in a long time.
1452113432|4.0|The story of this English, young cook, who wants to learn to cook French style and goes on her own to graduate from the famous chef school there in Paris (same as Julia Childs) is spunky and innovative. Her little, colorful cookbook is fun to read. The recipes are not totally outrageous or too difficult, but they are strange and unordinary and require a few ingredients that are not so easily available to the ordinary cook in AMerica. But I liked it and am enjoying challenging myself to try some new ways of making regular kinds of veggies, fruits etc.  I like her story of choosing to stay in Paris and finding a clever way to make a living while doing it. Great stuff.  Connie
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|steve carell is great yet again: funny, real, touching, vulnerable, moving, convincing. solid cast. great moments. watched it with my boyfriend and it was like a chick flick for me and a truly smart movie for him, too. it said so much about lovers, family, and just life in general. it was just so funny and smart. honestly, it was just such a solid film. i'm so glad i rented it for $1.99. i just regret not seeing in when it was in the theatres. i recommend this movie. excellent acting by everyone. SOLID.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Bingo!  I purchased another great game.  This game is full of endless puzzles!  I spent hours playing game after game.
B000F8O35U|5.0|We were quite surprised to find that this was a platinum edition at this price.  A very good value item.
B001HM1PFO|1.0|This isn't even so bad it's good. It's just bad. If you want to see it, I recommend seeing one of the &#34;shadow casting&#34; performances since at least it's tolerable when presented that way.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what i need for a quick calculation or a more complicated mathematical formula and it's handy on the kindle
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What if you lived your entire life in a silo deep underground big enough to house thousands?<br /><br />What if you were told your silo was the only one, humanity's only chance at survival?<br /><br />What if it were all lies?<br /><br />Hugh Howey has created an amazing world  filled with characters you will either love or hate.<br /><br />I think fans of sci-fi, dystopian fiction, along with anyone who loves a good suspenseful thriller will love this book.  I am getting ready to start the sequel, Shift, because the suspense is killing me......enjoy, I know I did!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldnt put these books down. I loved all three of them! I would definitely recommend them. I hope there will be more books to this series!
B0092S4WLY|3.0|Things are hidden in weird places and can only be accessed by hitting one specific spot  would like to see a little more leeway given.  Otherwise very creative and good variety of cold and number combos needed to solve puzzles.
B0083EY9EI|4.0|Incredible singer, incredible performances on youtube, all around gem, and a very accomplished songwriter.  When are we going to see her perform in the U.S.?
0375869026|5.0|I think people will like it because it shows lots of feelings.  Like when August finds out his principal's name is Mr. Tushman and laughs.  Another example is when August is being talked about behind his back and feels sad.  When he graduates from 5th grade and gets the best award for outstanding student he feels happy.<br />This book is different than other books I've read because it's based on a real person who has a deformed face.  It has taught me to treat others with issues with respect.<br />I liked this book because August really stood out from others.  He was always nice to people even when they weren't nice to him. He was used to having kids stare at him out of the corner of their eyes.
B00004WNHC|5.0|great product!, came well packaged and on time.  No scratches. Came with paper sleeve and outer plastic cover.  I would recommend getting it.  Bob's first platinum album!
0375850864|5.0|I would suggest this book to other middle schoolers because it teaches emotion and feelings.<br />It shows the importance of true friends, and how to stick together. I loved this book because of the true friendship between Sal and Miranda. When Sal almost gets hit by a truck, the laughing man saves him. And up until this event, Sal and Miranda were always trying to avoid him.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You do not need to have cancer to understand Hazel's love for Augustus. Their story, regardless of disease, is remarkable and not unlike the tragedy Romeo and Juliet.<br />I knew walking in that The Fault in Our Stars would be sad, depressing, and that I would wind up crying at multiple points throughout.<br />But I really didn't know that I would fall head over heals with this book the further I would dive in.<br />The Fault in Our Stars really is all that critics and fans say it is. This is not just a simple coming of age young adult book -- this is a novel. It should be a must read for teens and adults alike.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This is an excellent memoir that gives the reader a look inside women's prisons, the legal process, and the impacts of mandatory minimum sentences. Readers should not expect the gritty and sexualized experience depicted in the Netflix series, but instead a thoughtful reflection on women and how they care for one another in all situations.
B00004U8P9|5.0|I have been looking for a way to introduce friends that didn't experience this film in high school...and this was perfect.<br />Now I have a group going to see it at a movie theater to see how this cult film went crazy in theaters....look at world a new generation of fans is coming!
B006T3RM08|4.0|As other reviewers have noted, the fit is a little snug when both the keyboard and trackpad are placed inside of it.  (People say that the trackpad doesn't click very well because the &#34;clicking-feet&#34; doesn't contact the bottom of the dock).  I agree with every user out there, but my work around (instead of shaving plastic off the inside of the dock) is to place the trackpad in first such that it fits all the way in, then place the keyboard in.  The keyboard won't fit all the way in like the trackpad does, with a fraction of an inch jutting out of being a perfect fit.  But this isn't a deal breaker since everything works fine.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|I think it was better than the first one..I like when all the old guys get together..had good story..you should watch
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Great app. cant wait for chapter 2 (if they ever make it). Often when I search on the road I find SM stuck in the sky, walking in place! lol! One problem this app has is that you can die too easily. You can die just by staring at him. Actually, SM has never attacked me. You die by staring at him, or touching him. He never attacks. But yeah SM is pretty scary looking. And those tenticles, pure horror! The other problem is that if hes close, or if you look at him, the screen goes fuzzy and you cant see well. So ya this isn't perfect, but its still scary and fun to play! Buy this!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Keeps me coming back every season. If you can start at season 1. You don't want to miss a single show.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Wish I could rate this app a ZERO....THIS IS WHY I OUGHT NEW NEXUS 7'''''I want my google!  Google does everything right...this isn't you tube!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a great game to play. I really enjoyed playing this game. I hope everyone will enjoy this game too. Wish for more bongos.ok
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|As usual, ALL James Bond movies are a total escape for a couple of hours.  It's a Don't Miss movie!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Thought this was good but a bit slow to get going and I didn't like the ending - it was soooooo unexpected
B001FB5634|4.0|Very good, though dark, movie. Loved the book, had to see the movie afterward. Definitely worth seeing. Charlize Theron and Viggo Mortenson.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|No Shaun of the dead. But still a damn good movie. Makes you want to just shoot your gun off in the air.
B003JHKORK|4.0|The movie and story was good and so was the acting<br />Its a good popcorn movie. And that is all I have to say
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is fun for those people who like to play fast reaction games. I love it!! I would even buy it if it cost money. But thankfully it doesn't.
B00ARW2XJW|4.0|I got this app when our AC went out (in Arizona).  It does take some manipulation to refresh the data, but it is very useful.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I thought Chromecast was going to be great.<br /><br />I bought Chromecast to upgrade the Android stick that I currently use.  I thought that Chromecast would relegate my AppleTV to the never use anymore pile.<br /><br />Unfortunately, out of the box there were problems.  I wasted a lot of time trying to get Chromecast to connect to my modern Linksys router.  Chromecast does not have a USB slot to connect a wired ethernet adapter like my Android stick.  I thought my problem had to do with WiFi reception.  Instead, it turns out that Chromecast does not support long passwords!  Google this for the gory details.  I have not seen a basic problem like this in quite some time.<br /><br />My choice was to then change the password on my many devices or get another router to only work with Chromecast.  So I pull an old Apple Airport Express out of the heap and setup another network with a nice short password that Chromecast will like.  Unfortunately, I will have to switch my Google phone and Google tablet to this separate network every time I want to beam something to the Chromecast.<br /><br />Unfortunately, another problem arose.  The Google Nexus 4 and Google Nexus 7 won't connect to this new network.<br />Searching around, I find a Google Chromecast FAQ saying that they have a problem with Airport Express and to downgrade the firmware!<br /><br />Ok, I just want to get something to work so I pull out my laptop and install the Chromecast software.  I then switch the laptop to the Chromecast-only wifi network and I finally see some YouTube video on the TV.<br />Unfortunately, there is no sound!<br /><br />What a hassle at this point.  Talk about an out-of-the box experience.  Is Chromecast another Google \\"beta\\" headed for early retirement?<br /><br />So I call Google Support which is conveniently 24x7.  Unfortunately, their technicians are not really well trained and have never heard of the password problem or sound issue.  They aren't allowed to Google the web to even understand the issues.  They don't have 2nd level support to escalate the problem to senior people.<br /><br />Until these basic issues are fixed the Chromecast is just a pretty screensaver on one of my HDMI inputs.<br /><br />AppleTV remains the workhorse and the Android stick that I bought on Amazon is 2nd choice.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the only solitaire that I really enjoy, and for some reason cannot get it on my Kindle as of yesterday<br />I would like to know why. This is the reason I ordered the other two Solitaire games but do not enjoy them as much.
B00E0S52K6|5.0|Buddy Guy is 77 and one of the few links to that generation of blues players that is quickly passing. A great album to appreciate a true artist in a genre that laid the foundation for rock & roll.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I've come to expect a good read from this author, and wasn't disappointed. Thoroughly enjoying the tale. Next one, please!
B002YDTPHA|5.0|This is one of the best Final Destination movies.  I believe Final Destination 2 was the best of the bunch
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google Apps:  There's none better.when I want to know &#34;anything&#34;, all I need to do is go to GOOGLE and I will get the answer right away.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Excellent camera work, excellent acting, believable plot line. All in all, an extremely well-done and realistic performance. I am looking forward to the remaining episodes in the series.
B004U8VX2M|3.0|This was such an iconic series when it first aired. However, it doesn't hold up well against the test of time. The acting is wooden and the script uninspired. Basically it fails when compared to other 'contenders' whereas when the series originally aired, it was quite a novelty.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|love my dexter!  I have all the seasons, glad I got this.  Cant wait for last season to come out.
B0012GMWCA|4.0|Lucky Town is a much better effort than its companion, Human Touch. Gone is the slick '80s pop production. The arrangements are more organic and more suited to the lyrical content. The songwriting is also a bit stronger. Human Touch has a lot of generic love songs. Lucky Town is more personal and richly textured. It's probably under-rated because of the way it was released on the same day as Human Touch, and the cover art is similar. One might mistakenly assume that Human Touch and Lucky Town are alike on disc, but they are very different in sound and overall quality. Lucky Town may not belong alongside Bruce's masterpieces, but it's definitely above average and nothing to tarnish his legacy, as Human Touch does. It's very listenable and I enjoy it. I picked it up used and cheap (it's only 3.99 new from Amazon) and that is a steal. If you like Bruce, there is no reason why you won't like Lucky Town.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Mind challenging, addictive,fun, can't wait for more, kind of game! Love it and wish there more. So sad I have to wait.......
B000OR9NG6|4.0|Deep Purple were known for long jams in concert, and this album captures it perfectly. This lineup of the band is perhaps its most beloved. Today it might be hard to understand that Smoke On The Water, the studio version, was not released as a single until nearly a year after the release of Machine Head, and it fueled sales of Made In Japan. It was not unusual to hear the live version of Smoke On The Water played on the radio as often as the studio version. It fact it's the live version that I remember the most from that year.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of long instrumental jams and noodling around before getting to the point, you're not going to like Space Truckin' or Lazy. Also included is the obligatory over-long drum solo (The Mule) and a guitar/vocal back-and-forth (Strange Kind Of Woman), both of which are cliches of the genre.<br /><br />But you also get a hard-driving Highway Star and Smoke On The Water, and Child In Time is more stunning than the studio version. There are parts of the aforementioned jams that also cook, but you have to wait a long time for Jon Lord to quit noodling around on the organ before finally getting to the intro of Lazy. It's overindulgent and over-the-top but when a heavy metal band infuses long jams with elements of jazz and classical, well, it's almost bearable.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing Bingo Blitz on my Kindle for a year and a half. I really enjoy the graphics and the ease of playing on a touch screen. Thank you for this enjoyable game!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Photography, casting, the sets, the clothes, all spot on.<br />And the great writing.... what more can one say?<br />Can't wait for season 4.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book, very well written. Hated the ending, definitely not what I expected to happen which was very refreshing since most books can be so predictable.....NOT THIS ONE THOUGH!
B005HEPN06|4.0|Even after seeing the same episode multiple times, I'm still in awe by the quality of the show.  Great characters, story lines.  A true classic ahead of its time!
0307394549|5.0|I love Martha Stewart. Every recipe (that I've tried so far) has been wonderful! There is a cookie for every occasion! Her recipes are easy and fun to make!
B009J3K4MI|5.0|While not everything is perfect about these performances (naturally).  there are so many wonderful things contained in this ultra-bargain-box that I feel it demands 5 stars.  I like the presentation very much, much smaller of a box than I expected, but everything fits perfectly.  The accompanying booklet, while a bit small of print, is helpful and informative, including the contemporary liner notes as often as possible.  I have not had time to listen to all 60 CDs yet, but there have already been revelations.  The vividness and energy of Munch's Berlioz performances are quite stunning (his Debussy is altogether less convincing, but nobody's perfect).  Of course, the Heifetz concerti have been cornerstones of the listening repertoire for decades and they sound fantastic here.  The Fiedler and Reiner pops programs are wonderful, and include quite a few pieces (the Ruslan and Ludmilla and Colas Breugnon overtures, for example) that I crave when wanting to listen to something cheery.  Even the somewhat dry, \\"open-air\\" original acoustic of some performances (the Turandot has always been a bit harsh) shines in a better light.  The box has so many of the great standards, as well as some not-quite-so standard, that I know I will be enjoying the experience for a long time to come.  Being a big Reiner fan, it is great to have several of his best recordings in one box and in excellent sound.  Thanks, and bravi tutti!
B008XG1X18|5.0|ALL OF MY DAUGHTERS ARE ON THIS.  I FINALLY FOUND OUT ABOUT IT AND THOROUGHLY ENJOY IT.<br />ALL GREAT HINTS, USEFUL INFO.  LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT.
B00AWD4I6C|4.0|Good story, and action.  A dudes movie for sure with the shooting and gore.  I may watch the next one as this was pretty good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 seasons and am looking forward to watching Season 4!  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B000I3R796|4.0|It was an interesting story and the acting and action was pretty good as well.  It was slow a few points and the tone of the movie was a bit low key but still some good action.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all 3 seasons and am looking forward to watching Season 4!  Can't wait to see what happens next!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I have seen the first two episodes of Broadchurch, Season 1, and I am hooked. Like the first episode, the acting is superb and the plot has unexpected twists and turns. The quality is on par with the Masterpiece Mysteries. And the scenery is breathtaking. While my interest was first sparked by David Tennant - and he is fabulous - so is the rest of the cast.
030789701X|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of Skyrim, ever since its release, so when I saw this available, and at a much cheaper price than any other retailer, I knew I had to get it immediately. And any fan of Skyrim worth his salt would do well to get themselves a copy as well. I won't try and list everything here, as I'm sure I would do a disservice to it, but at 1116 pages, rest assured that this book has EVERYTHING one could ever need for the best possible time in the lands of Tamriel. Whatever your play style, Skill set, or Race may be, this book can guide you so that your character will be the absolute best it can be.<br /><br />As for the book itself... this thing is a tome if ever I've seen one. It is THE textbook/guidebook for those inexperienced in the ways of Skyrim. The style of the book is great; the cover gives it the appearance of the most valuable book in all of Tamriel. As for the contents, everything is presented in a clear and comprehensible way.<br /><br />If you're thinking about venturing into the wilds of Skyrim for the first time, you would do well to have this invaluable book as your disposal.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|If you like diable 3 in PC, get this game. Stunning graphics and a good story line. Run great on HTC One. Be ready to buy game credits if you want to upgrade your character and advance quicly.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The only problem is that so many of the upgrades and missions need coins and those are hard to come by.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Stunning graphics. Run great on HTC One. Missions are boring and repeating. Even though you buy game credits, you'll see a lot of mickey mouse missions while you wait for your daily mission.  You have to wait for hours to repair a damaged suit unless you buy game credits. I don't recommend it.
B009GX69RK|5.0|These characters are fantastic. I used to dislike Zooey Deschenal, but I think that's because I was jealous because she's awesome, and I think this is the funniest show on TV right now.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|A good story line. Missions and online multiplayer are awesome. Stunning graphics. Run great on HTC One. I can't give it 5 stars because you have to buy a lot of gold stars to build your military bases and to create troops and vehicles if you want to advance quickly.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Exceptional series!  I love every episode. If you were an X-files fan and like science this is a got to watch series
B00DYOOGYK|5.0|A good story line. Stunning graphics. Run great on HTC One. A very good action game. Loving it. Highly recommended.
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Everytime I see this movie I see something that I never saw or realized before. So nice to enjoy a movie over and over again!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Clever, unique unraveling of a very interesting story line.  If the reader enjoys family and courtroom drama, this book will keep you turning pages.  The author has you invested from the start right into that rather surprise conclusion.  Great read.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Tons of ideas and creativity brought to the surface thanks to this book. I am going to make some changes in the way I view the world. Thank you!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love this game it a lot of fun on multilplayer but it wont let me update it. i love this game
B000JMKQX0|5.0|started reading couldn't put it down-finished the book, and wanted a sequel . would recommend this book to a friend who likes fantasy/syfy
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very addicting and fun for killing time.  I like fact that game play doesn't require me to buy ingame money and if I don't want to do something I don't have to.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the best mouse I have ever used, and I've used quite a few gaming mouses. The side buttons fit with your thumb so it feels more natural when you click them. The 4 different DPI settings you can use with just a click of a button helps greatly when in-game switching weapons you feel need more sensitivity than the other. My only complaint would be that it is a rather large mouse, and took a little while to get use to the size.
B00846REIS|4.0|I wasn't expecting some of the turns in this book but looking forward to reading what is to come with Gideon and Eva.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game. Have to come back everyday! I'm addicted! The rooms are fun and I can't wait to complete my first room. Have met some great people on here too!
0865478007|4.0|The information contained in this book is very disturbing. The author elaborates in painstaking detail how the information that patients and even doctors receive about new drugs can be very misleading and often simply wrong. The many reasons for this extremely dangerous situation are described, but the main instigators is seems, as shown by the author, are drug companies.<br /><br />The author's passion for his subject matter shows on every page of this lively, spellbinding book. Plenty of detailed examples are given for each problem identified. Suggestions as to what can be done to improve matters are also given. This book should be of interest to everyone, since we will all need medical services sooner or later. How can we be sure that we are truly getting the best effective medication for each of our particular afflictions? The answer provided in this book is very troubling.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Is it possible to get the previous version? This app is bad. Save the storage space for a lecture on mating habits of some extinct species as it would be a better use of space. Save yourself and use the website.

B00CDV6WDS|3.0|It is OK but not the challenge that I had hoped for.  Many different layouts which does help some with the game.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|for all ages....my kiddo loves this game. We challenge each other. The one who takes less time or less number of moves is the winner!<br />Give some exercise to your brain
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have tried so many FM transmitter in the last few years that simply Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car FM Transmitter is the best of all. The sound is perfectly clear with no distortion, reception is 100% clear and it basically sounds like a local FM station. Great product for the price. If you are looking for a really great FM transmitter buy this one is simply the best. Reception range is more that 100 feet  depending on the terrain and obstacles.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I totally love this movie and love watching it again with someone that has never seen it.  One of my all time favorites!!! Great story and cast.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|I listen to this album when I jog and I never want to stop running! It is so good. Definitely worth the hype.
1476733953|2.0|It seems there's not an adverb or adjective that Howey doesn't like. Plodding, over-worked and in the end, boring. A good editor probably could've improved this book, but the plot holes would be hard to fill. Glad I borrowed this from the library.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan's previous books are all worthwhile and interesting.  I bought a lot of his little Food Rules books as &#34;stocking stuffers&#34; and small gifts.  Very nice little gifts.  This book is his best yet...by far.  It raises the investigation of how cooking has influenced (...actually made possible) human life and culture.  Every page semms well written.  Some of the observations rise to the level of philosophy other seem like poetry.  If you feel about barbecue, it is easy to see it as a brilliant religious treatise.  (I personally am &#34;BBQ Southern Orthodox&#34; but accept that other belief systems may exist no matter how wrong-headed.)  If this book doesn't make your heart sing, your mouth water and your bile rise against those who are making our food system less flavorful and nutritionally deficient, then you have no soul.  Buy the book, read it, lend it, gift it to others.
B007NZQU72|5.0|I found a description of my life in this book.  I like others wish I'd had access to these insights during my high school years.<br /><br />Once engaged, I'm often too open with people.  It is a lack of filters or something.  I've often thought of myself as broken / overly sensitive.  High school gave me a lot of reasons to have a low opinion of myself.  I have adapted a variety of defense mechanisms.  I do fairly well in groups now and even perform public speaking with relative ease.  These achievements came with numerous costs.  I shunned of love interests as I'd failed at my first deep love interest.  I became extremely isolated with a single minded pursuit of PhD degree in an esoteric topic that didn't lend itself to casual explanation.<br /><br />Having finished that book now and it puts a new light on a great many things.  It has prompted me to reinvestigating a number of events in my life.  Being highly sensitive is a blessing and a curse.
B000IZ8DZQ|2.0|While the Italian Job starts out beautifully (ie a Ferrari driving through the Alps), it disintegrates quickly into a 1960's free-for-all free love for all high school flick. There doesn't seem to be much of a plot, and it leaves more loose ends than a freshman English short story. Michael Caine does an excellent job acting, but the movie lacks identity. Is this Ocean's 11, or Herbie the Love Bug? After the final car chase scene, you decide.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|xclnt movie !!!!...:) great movie to watch..great special effects...worth the watch...humor,love,action, loved Anthony Hopkins in it & the guy who played Thor was great!!!!....
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It was the best thing for some time. I found a bunch of the people I lost after we graduated. I love watching my kids and grandchildren grow and what is going on in their lives. It is like a book of KNOWLEDGE.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The season 3 episodes were addicting and I watched all of them in ONE rainy weekend. I was watching alone and would speak outloud to no one each time I was shocked, stunned or suprised by all the twists and turns in the story. DA is so well written and acted. Season 3 is a must see! Thank you Amazon Prime for bringing this television experience in to my living room...and the free shipping isn't bad either!

B0001CNRBG|5.0|the johnny mathis [sp?] tune is only one part of this hilarious movie. allan alda does comedy and drama in this film. a must for his fans.
B00AOMSNUI|1.0|I was looking forward to getting the new version of &#34;let it bleed&#34; on Vinyl as my original '69 version was long gone to the vinyl graveyard in the sky. This version is a remastered version on clear vinyl and clearly the remastering has affected the quality in an adverse way. After listening to it twice I concluded this was not worth keeping and returned the product for a full refund.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|the late, great steve mcqueen in one of his best movies. a great romantic lead, indeed! arguably, he was one of our best actors, ever, right up there w/ cary grant.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Morgan Freeman only appeared in the movie no more than 20 minutes.<br />Another meaningless story with two big names.<br />Sometime I wonder why these two actors will do a movie like this?
B00C2IJJF0|1.0|This is the second steelbook that I have purchased from Amazon.com.<br /><br />1st steelbook being Gladiator which arrived in a jiffy bag and was the worst quality steelbook that I had ever purchased (deformed due to severe dents) replacement steelbook was great and has pride of place in my collection.<br /><br />Amazon.com customer service were excellent (by far the best customer service that I have experienced) The price of the steelbooks are great (original artwork) all positive. Just a shame that the packaging and quality issues have let them down.<br /><br />2nd steelbook Clash of the Titans arrived in a jiffy bag (all paint chips all over the stelbook which can be clearly seen through the  cellophane (why bother ship it if the steelbook is in that condition) I have not even bothered to unseal or contact Amazon.<br /><br />Very disappointed! next on my list I was going to order Sherlock Holmes but not any more
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|One thing I can bet on in a Spark's movie - Someone is gonna die!  A more quiet drama than his other book converted movies.  Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable picture.
B002VWNID6|4.0|If I had to come up with a list of some of the best action movies I had ever seen then certainly \\"Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves\\" would be somewhere on that list. Almost throughout the movie from beginning to end the action is almost non-stop with a little comedy and some romance here and there to help keep the movie interesting. Kevin Costner is the star of the film and \\"Robin Hood\\" rates as one of his finest performances. For some reason a lot of people who want to complain about this movie like to pick on the accent, or I guess I should say the lack of an English accent, being spoken by Costner. Really?!?! With all that non-stop action taking place on the screen with fights and flaming arrows flying and battle scenes you have time to notice how Kevin Costner is speaking in the movie? Ok I will give you that the movie takes place in England and all but I really don't think the entertainment in this film is lessen by Kevin Costner not speaking with an accent. I find despite the lack of the accent Costner really gets into the roll and I find him quite believable as Robin Hood. Certainly I would rate Costner's performance as one of the best if not the best Robin Hood ever to appear on the silver screen.<br /><br />However to me the real star of this movie is Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham. Rickman plays a delightfully evil Sheriff and provides the definite portrayal of the Sheriff of Nottingham. What makes the performance so good is the enjoyment that Rickman gets from playing such a dastardly character. A lot of actors like to play the bad guy in a movie because the bad guy usually has the best and most interesting roll in the movie. With Rickman that is certainly the case here. There have been other actors to play the part of the Sheriff of Nottingham in other versions of Robin Hood up on the screen but none took over the roll and made it his like Rickman did in \\"Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves\\". His portrayal is so good that I can't think of Alan Rickman without thinking of the Sheriff of Nottingham and visa versa.<br /><br />All in all this is I think one great action movie that you will enjoy if you like that genre of movie. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and I promise you will get so caught up in the story line of the film you will very quickly forget the absence of any accent on Kevin's part. I would recommend this anyone to watch.ithout thinking of the Sheriff of Nottingham and visa versa.<br /><br />All in all this is I think one great action movie that you will enjoy if you like that genre of movie.

B00466HN6S|2.0|Didn't like this one at all.  The plot was interesting but wasn't as funny as it should have been. Too predictable.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|It's exactly what I expected... Being an AHS fan, as well as a horror/creepy kind of movie lover, this fit perfectly for my kind of interests. I watched the first season on Netflix, and then purchased season 2 here. There's really not much to say other than it being another great season of AHS. Can't wait for season 3!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really enjoy playing, but feel that more people would play if we could play for free more than once a day, and if the payouts were better.  Thank you for the free gamesites.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I got what I expected, lots of fun and good entertainment. I wish I could find more movies like that, poor entertainment.<br /> I enjoyed it very much.
B007AL48UK|3.0|the rules are absolutely wrong and make no sense. some tiles that should be free are not. some times that should NOT be available mysteriously are
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I already love this movie and with some special feature and extended edition! Is the must  I could have ! WOW !  Jean Reno is fantastic in that role! and Nathalie Portman so young and so true in her interpretation!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Lots of fun I love the free game play and getting more lives and jewels.  Wish I could get more lives sooner
1401941893|2.0|Come on, a young, filthy rich, fashion supermodel gives advice to ugly earthlings?<br /><br />Puhlease.<br /><br />She lacks any life experience or basis to give credible advice on how to be happy.<br /><br />To be happy is to know what it is to suffer.  She lacks understanding of what it is to be non-white, poor, fat, unhealthy or old, or to be from a marginal culture or country.<br /><br />It would only be more worthless if someone from the British landed aristocracy wrote it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun to play. Free rooms and slots when you have no credits left. Simple to get more credits and fun to gather room items.
B007MU85D0|4.0|I've had their album for over a year and each time I listen to it I feel like I am rediscovering myself in their music.  No matter what mood I'm in, Of Mice and Men make me feel happier and more centered.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|I've tested this with my iPhone5, iPod Touch 4th & 5th gen. In terms of size, they all fit. There's room on this adapter for a thicker device. It's made of cheap plastic, so it might not hold up to much abuse. The threading on bottom looks weak so be careful not to over tighten! However, with care, I hope it lasts a while. For the price, I have no regrets.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It is simple and easy and wakes me up. Simplicity always gets high marks from me so thank you very much
B0072GPQNG|5.0|What a great movie the whole family can enjoy together. A heart warming story, with a few tears, but also very happy moments.<br />Enjoy this movie, especially if your an animal lover.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|another great film about star trek and it is a must see!! Actors played a great role and it is full of action. Hope to see the next one soon!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Entertaining plot.  Not too much over-the-top graphics. My wife liked it too and she is more of an &#34;Emma&#34; fan.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|It's good to hear this song, especially after waiting so long for new material since Lady Gaga released &#34;Born This Way.&#34; It's upbeat, and Lady Gaga...the Queen of Pop has produced another excellent testimony to her great talents.
B00ECUX7HC|5.0|Very good album by a great band.  Lots of musical talent on this album. Tedeschi's vocals and Truck's guitar work are just amazing and they play even better off of each other. The band they have selected is so good they knock your socks off. I can't wait to see them really take these songs on stage and jam them out in concert.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|We really enjoyed this movie. You understand, going in, that this is a science fiction movie, but it appears to be a post-apocalyptic movie. Actually, it is both. Without giving away anything, the enjoyable part is that there are a few twists to the plot make it just a bit suspenseful but also answers questions you have. The acting was solid and the special effects weren't overly done and only used as necessary.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I really like the game. It is very upsetting when the game freezes and you do not get to finish it.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Good movie, great 3d effects.  Loved it in the theatres, loved watching it at home.  The scenes are fascinating.  The setting for the story is beautifully crafted.  Story line borrowed from Asian movies, but overall good movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fast moving addictive games.  Love all the bingo rooms and slots and you move up in levels very quickly. I also love that the collections you play for are things associated with the various cities the rooms are named after and that they have tried to get a bit of an accent in the callers although at times the accent is pretty cheesy like a bad actor
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have been putting off reading this book for several years but with the interest in the movie, I wanted to understand the story line from the author's perspective not just from the screen writer.  I've started the second in the series Speaker for the Dead, it's a little slow but there is a definite separation between the first and second books, it just doesn't pickup where Ender's Game ended.  Kind of refreshing to say the least.

B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I truly enjoyed the second season as well as the first. It was still very sexy and smart, I just think the storylines dragged out a little longer than my attention span could handle. It's like the new guy your dating after the first year...
B004EBZX6W|4.0|whatever it is supposed to do.  It is very difficult for me to rate this product which is a great mystery to me.
B005544V6A|5.0|I started watching this season online because I saw a commercial for the third season, and I was intrigued. But I wanted to have a background before. I loved every minute. It was so fast moving; I was never bored, great writing and interesting stories, but the best part was I never figured out the outcome before the end. So it was also smart! And funny!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I've been reading these books for over a year now, and I just love this world more than I can ever express. I don't want the series to ever end!
B00A81MV3U|4.0|I became a Jennifer Lawrence fan with her role in 'Winter's Bone' and have appreciated her ability to be the character she's portraying in total. Bradley Cooper did a superb job in his role as a bi-polar man from a dysfunctional family.  Some things in the movie were very predicatable but that didn't diminish the story line and the flow. The movie is warm, funny, and intense and defintiely worth watching - again.
1849161577|5.0|As a student in the medical field I have used this book and John Ratey's more recent book, Spark! The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and The Brain, for information and references in several research papers on topics from ADD-ADHD and child obesity. AND I received an A for each paper!<br />  In this book he describes how the brain works and how it's affected by our physical activity. He gives several examples of different scientific studies for depression and other mental illnesses and compares that to the results discovered by exercising. He shares sucess stories of individuals who have been helped and even changed their lives after discovering the mental benefits of exercise. John J. Ratey's books are written in a straight forward and easy to follow language; he draws you in with this exciting new idea of exercise therapy.
B00C061I3K|1.0|When Daft Punk announced a new album I was hesitant. What would new daft punk album bring? The French duo's first two albums have become electronic classics while their 3rd album \\"human after all\\" was a bit of a mess. The duo's soundtrack for Tron redeemed them in my eyes. The Tron soundtrack plus Kanye West's \\"sampling\\" of \\"harder, better, faster, stronger\\" also brought them a higher commercial profile. A now we have \\"Random Access Memories\\".<br /><br />The first single \\"get lucky\\" feat Pharrel is a fun track but basically sounds like Jamiroquai album filler or a Chic bside. The rest of the album descends into a 70s disco retread without the fun. One reviewer wrote the old Daft Punk is gone and I must agree. Random Access Memories strives for urban street cred by adding rappers and funk stars while trying to maintain its electronic cool by referencng and including Giorgio Moroder. All the efforts fail. What the album is a very cold, over produced effort that doesn't really break any new ground nor entertain which is sad. This is the group that gave us the old school sound of \\"da funk\\" and the dance floor euphoria of \\"one more time\\". If CDs were still popular this would be the CD everyone bought on hype but ends up in bargain bins and used cd shops everywhere after we all got tired of the 1 good song we heard on the radio. In the download age I imagine this will be electronic information sitting on a drive that's destined be deleted or listened to only when shuffle randomly pulls it up. In that sense the album titled is correct.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This book is listed in the book 1001 BOOKS YOU SHOULD READ BEFORE YOU DIE.  I downlowded it and realized that I had read it before.  Well worth reading.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|Let me start by saying, I have been using computers since I was 5, and by now with some ease. I am no stranger to downloading music, I've been doing so since the Napster days.<br /><br />Without going into every single story, I have to say the Amazon system for accessing MP3's is by far the least intuitive, most poorly programmed system available. It's bizarre something from an otherwise wonderful, customer satisfaction oriented company is so poorly designed.<br /><br />Purchasing is easy with Amazon. which is why I chose it over iTunes a few times. Each time, I remember how terrible the downloading system is, but I figure \\"oh I was probably just not figuring things out, silly me!\\". Wrong. It's genuinely terrible.<br /><br />Just today, I purchased 20 or so songs, but in order to retrieve them (oh, and honey, this is after a call to Amazon and FOLLOWING THEIR INSTRUCTIONS) I was somehow forced to re-download everything I had in my Amazon history. So rather than 20 new songs, I now have 200+ duplicates plus my new songs. I feel violated by you Amazon. So does my hard drive space.

0060574216|4.0|While reading &#34;Men are from Mars ...&#34;, I could relate - in that I didn't realize that I had &#34;committed&#34; those same mistakes.  I didn't understand the nature of men and the need to escape to the cave.  As well as I didn't realize that as a woman, I should not be nagging but rather appreciative of my partner.  After reading this book, I have made positive changes and am hopeful to reignite a relationship with my best friend.  The information is invaluable and I thank my friend for recommending this book. I never thought that I would be &#34;one of those people&#34; that would need this book, but I was and I thank God numerous times a day for the words written and for the opportunity to expand my view.

B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I've rewatched this film several times because I enjoyed the story, but even more I loved the score. Maggie Smith never fails to be wonderful!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|While I love the game, my issue is with the company that doesn't credit my account when I purchase credits, ignores the countless emails that I send and refuses to refund my money. Don't waste your time trying to contact anyone at buffalo studios. They'll just ignore you.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|George C Scott IS Patton.  I've watched this movie over and over.  Finally downloaded it to the PC to watch it again.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|The blu-ray DVD had the film, almost four hours, plus the film with informative pop ups showing photographs of the real characters and letting the viewer know who was real and who was fictional.  Added to that was a long 'making of' featurette about the difficulties of shooting in the desert location, and about a dozen shorter featurettes - everything from how they cast the camels, how they marketed the film in different ways in different countries,  to the trailer.  To round it off, there were a number of interviews with cast members.  The transfer of the 70 mm film to blu-ray DVD gives an incredibly sharp picture which almost approximates the theater experience if you have a large screen TV and surround sound.  The music is just unforgettable - perhaps the greatest movie sound track ever.  At times the music gives way to total silence which emphasises even more the emptiness of the desert.  Two of the greatest scenes ever filmed are in this film - when Lawrence blows out a match which immediately turns into a brilliant red desert sunrise, and the very long silent scene at the water hole when Sharif Ali rides in from a mirage.<br /><br />For those who never saw the original theater release 50 years ago, and missed an experience of a lifetime, this DVD is a must have.
B004JMZPJG|3.0|To small for my needs.  It was advertised as for a camcorder but that is all that will fit.  No room for my accessories.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|When it worked, it amplified sound without any noticeable impact on quality.  Then it stopped working.  I wasn't even lugging it around, it sat on my desk at work the entire time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game the only thing it sometimes freezes when playing the tournament.hope this issue can get fixed because I enjoy playing this game.
B0030SZ2D4|4.0|Great first-ish movie of his career. A little cheesy looking back on it now, but I still love the story line and premise. I watched it to refresh my memory in anticipation of Riddick coming out in Sept! Woohoo!
140006922X|5.0|Aslan relates the historical context of the life of Jesus of Nazareth in a fascinating, yet intelligent style.  His indexing and extensive chapter notes make it easy to navigate through the book to go back to recall information in earlier sections of the book as you get further into the story.  He has obviously studied this subject intensively in countless resources over many years.  I love the subject, the writing style, and the author's passion for revealing the &#34;real&#34; Jesus of Nazareth.
0767903862|5.0|I'm not going to wax poetic here, but when I read this book, I laughed out loud so many times, with such force, that I can't not write a review. The book was highly readable, enjoyable to the max, tremendous. I have no idea why anyone would give this book lower than 5 stars. I don't know the writer, but he sure sounds fun. Best summer read out there.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|My kindle can barely keep up with all the fun with all the games. Awesome.The funniest is the 5 free games.

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|What an excellent movie. The people chosen for this movie nailed it. You'll be emotional within the first 5 minutes and on the edge of your seat the rest!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After the first couple of pages I was worried that this would be too easy of a read for me. However, before I finished the first chapter I was proved wrong.  The flow of the book is easy and wonderful, but it's full of challenging words that have since strengthened my vocabulary! The characters are so lovable and relatable and the story touches on the good and not-so-good qualities of humans and life. Definitely recommend!
B004FHBO9K|3.0|First off, the music on this collection is 5 stars. My 3-star rating is for the vinyl quality. The first copy I got was warped, I assume during shipping. Nobody's fault really. Sent that back and got another copy. There are more pops and clicks that I think are acceptable for a new piece of vinyl. Not sure if this is why it is priced so low, but I was disappointed. I still kept it, but when you buy new vinyl you expect a clean sound. I have 50 year old records that sound better as far as the surface noise. So great soundtrack, with disappointing quality in the vinyl.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Wonderful book I recommend watching the show first it will give you a good face for each and every person
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play everyday and look forward to collecting my free bingos daily and even playing the five free bingo games given each day! One of my favorites!
1452113432|5.0|I love her and her show. I think she is a wonderful cook, and just as cute as she can be. I wish I could go to her restaurant
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Of course, they didn't get everything, but I really enjoyed this movie.  Looking forward to the next one.  Recommend it.
B0031ES8P6|3.0|The image is deceiving, as I thought I was getting a toy with a purple tartan, not pink. It is also smaller than the listed dimensions. It shipped quickly and arrived safely, but I am very disappointed about the color not being what was pictured, nor is it listed that it is a pink tartan, not purple.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|This movie is a classic. I love all the classics being remastered and coming out on blue ray. I ordered this along with lonesome Dove. Both are great prices.
B000B589JI|3.0|Of course mine leaked right out of the package, as others have also stated.<br /><br />Some measurements indicate that either the threads on the body or the cap are too short.  This prevents the parts from firmly compressing the gasket, because the parts do not screw together deeply enough before running out of threads and locking up.<br /><br />I found that an o-ring in size -114 fits snugly and is thick enough to seal.  It's not perfect, as the mating parts were designed to seal against a flat washer, but it's easy to obtain and works.  Make sure you get a buna-n (very common) o-ring material, as neoprene has poor resistance to naphtha.<br /><br />I also noticed that the product listing says this is made in USA, but my package says China.  No wonder the tolerances are off!
B00A3ZJIY6|5.0|Great picture and sound in HD all on my Kindle Fire. Is Titanic the best movie ever? I think so.... Go Amazon!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I really like this song. True Gaga style. She is a great artist! I would recommend it. Little Monsters will love it!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|We are in the last season of Dexter.  I realized I had not watched the initial season.  I purchased the DVD at a very good price.  It arrived in a very timely manner.  I &#34;stopped&#34; the world and sat down and watched it.  So glad I got it!
B00ABA1OP4|5.0|GREAT QUALITY OF THE VIDEOS AND THE SELECTION OF THEM IS AWESOME, JUST PERFECT!!! A LOT OF EXTRAS AND INTERVIEWS!!
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Honestly Tom Hanks needs to find better scripts. The story was good, but a bit confusing. I guess that was the point, to be thought provoking and confusing.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Entertaining but not a lot going on. Kind of predictable.Easy read.Great for the bed stand or the beach. Check it out at the library.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie by these aging spys and hit men who bond together to do some serious &#34;senior citizen&#34; butt kicking.
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|Awesome! My daughter and I listen to it all the time. I also used the music as a ringtone on my cell phone.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is an extraordinary series, which I recommend without reservation for the history buff, or just anyone who cares about quality drama, our history and the brave men who fought for us all.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I couldn't wait to get my season 2..i always watch the prior season before the new season premier..revenge is awesome
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Freezes, goes out and does not give credit for bingo. Says you will get credit but doesn't happen.  Also if you are touching number at the bottom of card, it will register as a \\"bad call\\" and knock that card out.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The sense that all of the fantasy could be imagined and yet was wonderful if it were true makes this a lovely read.  I was a little disappointed at the end, but enjoyed the ride immensely.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't imagine that the 2nd in the series would be as good but I can't wait to read the final book.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Fun and actioned packed with a great cast of seasoned, outstanding actors.  Highly recommend - also loved the Red 2 Sequel.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I've read this a number of times. One of my favourite books. It's especially good when I need to be transported.<br />I had to leave most of my books behind when I moved overseas and I was wishing I had this book again. I tried the free sample on my kindle and it was substantial. Took me some days to read through the sample. One day I'll get the whole thing again.<br />I always find new interesting things each time I read this.<br />This is a book you will really enjoy.
B00785P2QC|4.0|cool game very fun wish i had more time to play just downloaded to check it out and i love it now
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing. Relaxing, slow paced but still very fun! I would like more ways to quickly earn gems without having to spend money.
0670022950|5.0|This is one of the two most important books I have ever read, the other being Barrington Moore, Jr., *Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy* (1966). The fact that we live in a globalising world of complex interdependence where interstate war -- and other forms of violent conflict too -- and dramatically declining is not often recognized given the scare tactics of, for example, the so-called &#34;global war on terror.&#34; Pinker identifies the key converging trends -- economic globalization, the normalization of the state, and the internalization of Enlightenment values and norms -- and examines them in remarkable thoroughness and depth.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does exactly what it says on the can and the price is right. I need six more words. There.

B000026FJ6|3.0|I was, and I am still, looking for a good consistent CD of calming peaceful music. I bought three of Mike Oldfield's CDs and after listening gave them all away. Too many variations on one album.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|Enjoyed Setterfirld's style of writing as much or more than the story itself.  She pulled me in with each turn of a phrase.  The story is dark at times, always fascinating, and provides the unexpected. Great read!
B000002MFQ|2.0|Too many different styles for my liking. Expected a full CD of calming consistent music but found it to be a bit annoying rather than calming. i gave it away.
6304698798|5.0|This is one of the best western movies ever made.  (As is &#34;The Wild Bunch&#34;)  It's not a typical western where the hero rides off in the sunset with the girl. The three leading guys in this movie were perfect for their roles.  I especially like Eli Wallach as the ugly.
B0013XS8A2|2.0|I purchased three CDs by Mike Oldfield and found them to be very much alike. I was looking for relaxing background music but some of the selections sound almost frantic. I gave it away.
B000P0J06K|5.0|In my mind this is the best Batman, even considering the newer versions.  When this first came out, I didn't think Michael Keaton would be a good Batman, but I was wrong.  Palance and Nicholson just made it better.
B00AYB0YFQ|5.0|HD quality, streamed without pausing (no buffering), and clear audio. Would love if all the Scary Movies were available for Instant Prime!
B001B3MCQK|5.0|I heard Sixto's music in the film, Searching for Sugarman and really liked it. The CD is not disappointing. It combines folk, rock and little blues. Lyrics are smart and each song has a unique sound--unlike a lot of albums where stuff ends up sounding the same.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like this app its simple to use and I can get all I need to know for my area at one glance.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like this game. I play it almost daily but there are a few things that annoy me:<br />- the fact that one loses tokens if the program crashes my KF<br />- I don't care about socialising during the game so I opt for no chat yet still appears and I can see their conversation which is irrelevant to me.<br />- I like to play with the maximum amount of cards possible but numbers are called too fast specially in the daily tournament. The program has little captions with tips and one suggests to reduce the amount of cards...I say slow down so we can play with the same amount and have fun. We are not in a casino!
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I love watching George Clooney, but living in Hawaii, I can say the depiction of Hawaiian locals is totally wrong.
B009YQJ322|5.0|We need more films like these. You can tell the makers love the material and took the time to construct a realistic, albeit, gritty future. If you like action, get this. If you like beautiful cinema, get this.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|LOVE playing these games. Although it's far to easy. Could do with being more challenging, graphics are good and the game overall is enjoyable. Family fun
B0012GTZC0|2.0|Moves very slow and is boring  I normally like Ken Follett's books but this was a total waste of time
B005QYKD4I|5.0|Excellent movie. . . .  At 157 minutes, &#34;Transformers: Dark of the Moon&#34; isn't just a movie. It's a sentence.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is wonderful! The dog's perspective on things humans do is often a crack-up, but also very thoughtful. The simplest description of this book is that it will make you smile. It was a joy to read.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game! I love how it gets faster and more complicated to dodge the obstacles. My 6y.o. son is great at this game and I believe it helps him with hand/eye coordination. Wish there was an easier was to El Macho, but, we will find him!
B004XUMPFQ|5.0|This is just a wonderfully compelling space Western tale under the genius of Joss Whedon, I can't wait for season two.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|For $1.29 this has been amazing. Since I'm an iOS user and Windows, having it on the Amazon Cloud makes it easy to buy, download to my laptop, then put into iTunes &/or any other music device.

B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a fun game to play. My whole family enjoys playing this game. Would recommend it to any one. Everyone loves it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was the best ever, I've yet to read a book that has come close to the excellence of this one only thing I would change is nothing because it's so perfect. The reason why I would give it this grade is because it's the best, no other way to explain using words.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the app! It is very educational. The app has money management (does not put pressure on kids.) It taught my kids new vocabulary and creature's habitat . My kids said they &quot; feel like the boss&quot;. I've played the app before and you also have to take request from Dory, nemo Merlin ... your children will also know on what to spend and when to save his/her sand dollars.  You also collect money from coral you grew plants ... Oh, I almost forget to tell you its undersea gardening to make a reef.<br />:)
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I love jewels and its other similar games.  I thought this one would be as challenging but was disappointed.  Just lacks some challenge and tends to be slow changing into new adventures.
034580404X|3.0|I read this book out of curiousity as everyone was talking about it.  Glad I read it if only to say I did.  The basic story was good.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Worth the read, even if just for a handful of new ideas and concepts... especially about the new era we are entering in terms of jobs and 'careers'.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I love this kind of material.  I just started reading it but will surely finish it and hopefully apply. Interesting reading.
B007QJ8VBI|4.0|Although the movie may not have been the best movie ever made, it only required that it be fun and enjoyable.  As a Kid, I never had the benefit of watching either of Doris Day's or Cary Grant's movies when they first came out.  These days, being able to watch movies made to the standards of an earlier time, a more innocent time makes me happier than watching over the top explosions, car chases, or just plain outright DUMB script writing.  So, grab some popcorn, put your feet up, and watch these movies.  A TOUCH OF MINK brought a smile to my face and that is all I needed it to do.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I didn't have a big interest in this topic before reading the book but Cheryl's account of what happened along her journey is absolutely captivating! By the end, you feel emotionally connected to her and are rooting for her every step. I would definitely recommend to a variety of audiences. There are some more adult topics (i.e. intimacy / drug use) so I wouldn't recommend for young adults.
B00BEIYH6U|4.0|Comics Books, Graphic Novels and more are coming to life it seems like once a month these days. In this sequel, \\"Kick Ass 2\\" written and directed by Jeff Wadlow (Never Back Down, Cry Wolf) this film picks up were the first film left you with a newly banded `super hero' team of basically regular people fed up with the US Justice system, which is made up of kids and  and vigilantes banded together to protect their city.<br /><br />The super hero `Kick Ass' is back with more motivation than ever to be as good as his best super hero friend (Hit Girl) and is again performed by Aaron-Taylor Johnson (Savage, The Illusionist) who does a great job of showing his angst, ambition and eventual confusion at a major crisis that is forced upon him. His father played by Steven Mackintosh (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, Underworld: Evolution) tries to convince him, with a lot of passion and conviction, of doing the right thing but it all eventually leads to one of them making the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Chloe Grace Moretz (500 Days of Summer, Hugo) is back as Hit Girl and with the death of her father in the last film and he dilemma with living with her father ex-partner, now her guardian played by Morris Chestnut (Identity Theft, Boyz N The Hood), she is torn between being the person she is - Hit Girl - or the person everyone thinks she should be. Chloe is amazing to watch both as herself and as `Hit Girl'. She could be an X-Men if you ask me!<br /><br />And of course you good guys like Clark Duke (Hot Tub, Greek) playing  Marty (whose alter ego is `Battle Guy'), Augustus Prew (Charlie St. Cloud, About A Boy) as Todd (whose alter ego is `Ass Kicker') and Donald Faison (Scrubs, Remember The Titans)  as  `Dr. Gravity' banding together with `Colonel Stars and Stripes'.<br /><br />You also have your bullies and baddies like the snarky and rude Claudia Lee (Heart of Dixie) playing Brook the high school `bi&?h' and of course Christopher Mintz-Plasse (Superbad, How To Train Your Dragon) is back as Chris (and his alter ego Motherf*&?er). Both do their very best to stop our heroes and destroy their personal lives. Add in the element of a `butler' of Chris  with a character named Javier played wonderfully by John Leguizamo (Ice Age, Moulin Rouge!) who gives his character much heart and passion to this truly idiotic example of a super villain.<br /><br />Now the surprising delight was the addition of Jim Carrey (Ace Ventura, The Truman Show) as `Colonel Stars and Stripes' who has a big hart but a desperate desire to violently rid the city of scum and villainy. Jim is obviously have a really great time doing it too and his physically up for the challenge as well. Pretty impressive work Jim!<br /><br />Overall the movie is fun and filled with action and some great fighting sequences. And you can follow these fighting sequences well because the director chose to use a standard tripod instead of the all shaking, all vomiting, all have-no-clue-who-hit-who hand-held camera style most actions films seem to think is `cool' these days. Most of the action does defy the laws of natural physics, but because you care and follow the good guys, you go with it. Clever dialogue and a big heart make this sequel better than the first for me.

B008JFUNTG|4.0|Thor Freudenthal (Diary of A Wimpy Kid, Hotel For Dogs) directed this sequel to the boy who was born to a human mother and one of the original Greek Gods, Poseidon. Marc Guggenheim (Green Lantern, Arrow) took the original novel from the very popular book series and written by Rick Riordan and did very a nice job at capturing the spirit and the heart of the story that is \\"Percy Jackson - Sea of Monsters\\".<br /><br />Logan Lerman (Stuck In Love, The Three Musketeers) reprises his role as Percy and this time his adventure is far more personal than he could have ever imagined. Percy finds out that he also has a half-brother named Tyson who happens to be a Cyclops and is wonderfully portrayed by Douglas Smith (Antiviral, The Boy Who Smells Like Fish). The two seem at odds, but Tyson innocence and sincerity really warm the hearts of everyone in the team and the audience.<br /><br />The team is back and it consists of the other half-humans/half-Gods like Alexandra Daddario (Texas Chainsaw 3D, Parenthood) as feisty Annabeth, Brandon T. Jackson (Thunderstruck, Raising Hope) as Grover who is a real Satyr himself and Leven Rambim (The Hunger Games, One Tree Hill) as Clarisse the over-the-top female bully of the bunch.<br /><br />One of the most interesting performances comes from Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, The Devil Wears Prada) playing Mr. D. who is the somewhat despondent caretaker of the fortress where all the Half-Gods are protected by a special tree that was made at the cost of the life of one of their own.<br /><br />One of the best and funniest performances comes from Nathan Fillion (Castle, Firefly) who plays Hermes, one of the original three God's first created by the Titans - the Messenger of the bunch. Nathan is obviously having way too much fun with his character in speaking about himself and his abilities and the fact that he himself has a now estranged and wayward son named Luke, another Half-God.<br /><br />Luke is basically the bad guy in this film, trying to assemble the original Titan who created all Gods and is played quite nasty by Jake Abel (The Host, I Am Number 4). All the kids are back with a few new ones added in the mix too.  The entire plot centers around saving the dying tree that protects the fort and stopping Luke from assembling the original Titan named Polyphemus (who is voiced by Ron Perlman (Beauty and the Beats, Hellboy)) who is pure evil and wants to destroy all the Half-Gods and the entire world and every human on it. How? He east them. Yum!<br /><br />There are wonderful effects including riding a wave on the ocean, a gigantic digestive system of a sea Monster as well as the creation and destruction of Polyphemus. They absolutely leave the ending open for a sequel but this film franchise has a smart heart, big story and wonderfully cast all the way around. Fun for the whole family!g to assemble the original Titan who created all Gods and is played quite nasty by Jake Abel (The Host, I Am Number 4).

B00ASVX1BQ|5.0|Finally, the issues have been corrected and I can enjoy this wonderful blu-ray! I may be a little biased because I was at the concerts where this was recorded, but also because of that I can tell you that this is an accurate portrait of what happened at those concerts, and it reflects very well the experience of seeing Tarja live. Two concerts were recorded, and here you can see a full concert, plus the songs that were different from the second concert, as well as an interview with Tarja and some photo galleries. The venue is gorgeous and the audience was really energetic.Tarja is a wonderful artist and I really recommend this to anyone who wants to see what her music is about.
B005IGDW24|4.0|Raja Gosnell (Scooby Doo, Yours, Mine and Ours) directs this sequel and believe it or not, this film is just as good and in some parts better than his the first film which he also directed. Now if you were a fan of the Smurfs before or really enjoyed the first one, this film has everyone back plus a few extra interesting characters and most importantly, a really good story about family!<br /><br />Yes, the arch nemesis Gargamel is back and has never more creatively being played by Hank Azaria (The Simpsons, Godzilla) who is masterfully reprising his role and obviously having  a lot of fun doing it too. You see Gargamel wants to harness the magic power of the Smurfs to increase his wizardry powers to the point in which he can control the entire world. (Insert maniacal laugh here.) However, currently he is a now world-famous magician travelling around and  using what is very little left of his Smurf position. They all end up in Paris, France this time!<br /><br />He ends up creating two new Smurf's that are greyish in color and require the magic Smurf liquid to survive and they are to be considered the `dark' side of what a Smurf can be. Christina Ricci (Sleepy Hallow, Monster) is the voice of Vexy, the spicy and nasty female version of Smurfette. Hackus, the fumbling, not-so-bright `dark' version of a Smurf is voiced by J.B. Smoove (SNL, Date Night).<br /><br />Vexy kidnaps Smurfette who is once again amazingly voiced by Katie Perry (The Ugly Truth, Madagascar 3), under the orders of Gargamel and the adventure ensues! In his last screen performance, Jonathan Winters (The Flintstones, Davis Rules) just before his passing, again reprises his heartfelt role of Papa Smurf. Also back are the always moody Grumpy Smurf voiced by George Lopez (Rio, Valentine's Day), the never intended to do anything wrong - Clumsy Smurf voiced by Anton Yelchin (Star Trek, Fight Night), the proudly Scottish Gusty Smurf voiced by Alan Cummings (X2, Goldeneye) and we are introduced to the extremely narcissistic new blue Smurf, Vanity Smurf voiced by John Oliver (The Daily Show, The Love Guru).<br /><br />Yes, Neil Patrick Harris (How I Met Your Mother, Doogie Houser) and Jayma Mays (Glee,Mall Cop) are back as the parents of Blu who is now 6 years old and is played by Jacob Tremblay (The Magic Ferret, Motive).  They are all eventually needed to help Papa Smurf find out where Gargamel has captured and imprisoned Smurfette. Neil does a wonderfully believable job as a father with issues with his own father and coping with being a father himself, is just not easy.<br /><br />Now here's where the movie takes a turn for the absolute better. Its real story is about family and what children mean to their fathers. How communication can sometimes be miss-interpreted and as often is the case, sometime parents do things that appear cruel to their children in order to protect them. In the long run, love has no boundaries. How is his introduced?<br /><br />Both Papa Smurf, Neil Patrick Harris and Neil's characters stepfather Victor, played wonderfully by Brendan Gleeson (Gangs of New York, Troy), all learn a valuable lesson of family and parenting. Again, it's extremely heartfelt and coupled with Smurfette learning about her new `sister' in Vexy, the film is a wonderful uplifting family treat. Forget Pacific Rim, see something you'll actually remember and feel good about!

0316228583|5.0|I was stuck at an airport layover with nothing to read and the bookstore selection was small. I had not heard of this book and did not have any prior interest in it. I picked Rowling because I was in need of distraction. I think I intended to read a quarter of it and leave it behind in the Atlanta airport as I've done with Harry Potter books and other airport purchases.<br /><br />To my surprise I found it delightful and brilliant. Though very serious in purpose the descriptions of the various characters' self-interested and overwrought obsessions are done with rapier wit. It is not a comedy in the ordinary sense - don't be looking for a pat ending. Some people end up better off for the events described, others worse. But they all seem believable and yet ludicrous at the same time.<br /><br />Very witty and subtly wise.<br /><br />The most amazing achievement is that despite the vast cast of characters (and the doubly vast set of names - most characters have at least two names by which they are referred to - and the speed with which I gobbled it all up - I had little trouble keeping track of which was which, everyone's quirks being so distinctive. I intend to reread it slowly. It's that good. It's occupied every spare minute for four days and I have just got to the end.<br /><br />Definitely not for everybody. People expecting something just slightly less innocent than Harry Potter should definitely go elsewhere. The book is dark, endlessly profane, full of its characters' cynicism and despair, and occasionally violent. But the book itself is anything but cynical. Rowling has been thinking a great deal about writing and about modern life. I think she will be remembered not just for the Potter books.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|Writer and director Neill Blomkamp (District 9) pulled off his second project with a lot of grace, but not a lot of passion. The visuals are absolutely stunning and the implied futuristic technology is amazingly impressive (although unfortunately for the human race now, justification), but the characters are typically what you would expect. The underdog with a dream, an adult mentor as a child, a mean and evil villain (government official - who else), an ambitious sidekick gone rogue...etc.. And again, what's with all the hand-held camera work and gratuitous street fights every film is having this days. In this film I really felt I was watching a CG enhanced version of Rockem'Sockem'Robots. It was a little old after a while.<br /><br />All that aside, there were some really good performances. Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, The Departed) plays Max, who we learn from the beginning, is the kid from the slums who wants to get out and live where the rich people live. Where there is no sickness, diseases or stress. Oh and yes he has his childhood girlfriend who now has a daughter, who is ill (incentive to go to Elysium), who he still does pine for her still even 20 years later.<br /><br />Now what is Elysium? It's an elite, beautiful, and militarily protected by the government, orbiting space station where the truly elite, truly rich people of the human race now reside. There are medical devices where you simply just lie down in and with a scan of your body that takes but a second or two, and whether you have a pimple or full blown cancer and everything (literally everything) in between it is cured all within seconds! I wish!<br /><br />Guess where Matt Damon, his girlfriend Alicia Braga (I Am Legend, City of God) and her sickly daughter Emma Tremblay (Her first film) want to go? Of course running the defense side of the \\"Homeland Security\\" of the station was the most impressive performance in the film as done by Jodi Foster (Silence of the Lambs, Contact). She assigns Sharlto Copley (District 9, The A Team) to hunt, find and kill all three of them. Did I mention Matt gets suited up with a bio electrically connected suit that we get to see surgically implanted into his head and body? Yummy!<br /><br />Now throw in another dark character and amazing performance by William Fichtner (Contact, Armageddon) as the programmer of Elysium, who along with Jodi Foster, want to re program the government and take over from the current president played by Faran Tahir (Star Trek -2009, Iron Man), and you have several time bombs set in the story.<br /><br />Throw in yet another very cool performance by Wagner Moura (Elite Squad 1 & 2) as the underground resistance trying to take over Elysium because the rest of the planet Earth is now a wasted, polluted and disease ridden garbage can. The film has a few surprises, of course, and some great CG work, but other than Foster, Fitchtner and Moura's performances being very intense, Matt is Matt. He is the action hero with a chip on his shoulder and mission to complete. It ended as it should and left nothing really to the imagination.<br /><br />The space station Elysium itself is impressive as well as their medical technology portrayed in this film but not a whole lot of meat or heart. There is lots of explosions and fighting, not much more of the more interesting aspects of the society or their technology. Good fun, nice effects, lots of gratuitous fighting, nothing really more.arlto Copley (District 9, The A Team) to hunt, find and kill all three of them.

B000LAZDQA|5.0|I had heard about the movie, but only because of the title, I did not know what the movie was about or even the plot.  I came across the movie, watched it and very surprised with the theme and the way the film developed.  It has very graphic scenes, so if you do not like that, do not purchase it.  It is not porn either nor soft porn, it is just the directors view on real life situations.  Great movie.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|While it was pretty good, some parts were much slower, and the plot wasn't great.  Still very good book though.  Characters were OK.  Not much character development or change throughout the story.  But the problem and solution were interesting and different.  And the twist on the futuristic society was very different from other books I've read.  Deffinately worth reading.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Enjoy this game more than any other out there! Play every day!!! A lot of different rooms plus slots!!! I would definitely recommend this game highly to anyone!
B00471Z3CI|5.0|As of this review, this movie is now over 30 years old - and it remains one of the greatest scary movies ever made.  It is timeless. I still get chills when I watch it.  The story line, the actors, the effects - everything in this movie - works in perfect unison.  From the very first scene to the last - you will love every minute of it.<br /><br />PS: My daughters are now terrified of clowns :)
B000FC0ZEO|5.0|If found it a little tough to grasp the premise of the book at first and it got a little far-fetched at the end, but basically, I really liked it.  There was actually some character development and there were a few surprises along the way.  Give it a read!
B005LAII80|5.0|Include me in the people who had never seen or read anything about the character Dredd. I watched this based solely on one person's recommendation and I'm glad I did. It is the second film on blu ray I have seen that was a box office disappointment in the past year that turned out to be a great film. Oblivion is the other and I love that film, too.<br /><br />Dredd is mostly wall to wall action and violence. It is VERY violent so that was a shock to me. I expected a superhero film with violence such as in The Avengers. Yes, I missed the part where this is rated R. But is it that much more violent than an episode of The Walking Dead? If it is, it's not by much. But just be prepared when you watch this film. It's not for kids.<br /><br />Urban is fantastic in the lead. We never see his face. We see his jaw and that's it as he works his way through the film and the mega city. He is a driven man and though we learn little about him personally (there are brief hints) it is his actions that speak loud and clear. He talks sparingly but when he does it's memorable and never campy.<br /><br />This is as pure as an action film gets. I think it is the best I have seen in a long time. It's right up there with Die Hard and destined to be a classic in the genre.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|I have been a FFDP fan since there first album. They don't do one thing that other bands seem to to a lot these days, and that is evolve there music. You may think that this is a bad thing, but I could not thank FFDP enough for sticking to the original sound that I know and love. There music has the same staying power that they displayed in the beginning and I could not be happier with this latest album. Too many of my favorite bands have lost the sound that they first displayed that made me love them. Linken Park is my biggest example. While I loved Meteora and Hybrid Therory, they have gotten away from the great rock techno sound. If you like FFDP's last album, you will love this album. Best tracks in my opinon are MINE, Mama Said Knock You Out, Dot your Eyes, and of Course Lift Me Up. Buy this and enjoy.
1451626096|4.0|I’ve enjoyed Philippa Gregory’s novels for a while now so I was excited to listen to her newest release The White Princess which is Book 5 in The Cousin’s War series but the book definitely stands on its own just fine as I’ve only read one in the series and it didn’t affect my enjoyment of this one at all. The White Princess is narrated by Bianca Amato who does an amazing job and I think she has the perfect voice for historical fiction. I’ve not had the pleasure of listening to her before but I have a few more audiobooks by her in my library that I will look forward to now. I enjoyed The White Princess especially in audio format and once in a while it’s fun to read a historical novel that is light and enjoyable and gives me a pleasant way to spend a few hours.<br /><br />The White Princess opens with Princess Elizabeth of York learning that her lover Richard III has been killed by Henry VII’s army. For her this is devastating as she will now be forced into marriage with Henry VII. Gregory spins a tale around this couple in which Elizabeth is taken against her will and until she becomes pregnant Henry refuses to marry her as he wants to make sure he’s getting someone fertile to continue the Tudor line. When she finally conceives they are married and while in the beginning of their marriage she hates him she finds that over time they begin to care for each other.<br /><br />Life for Elizabeth, even as queen of England, isn’t easy. She has to contend daily with her tyrant of a mother-in-law Margaret de Beaufort who would do anything and everything to ensure that her son stays on the throne. There is also the war between the Yorks and Tudors and there is the constant fear that a York will come out of the woodwork and put a claim on the throne. This led to more than one York supporter losing his life.<br /><br />Then there was Henry’s insecurities which threatened to overwhelm him constantly. His biggest fear was that one of the boys who had disappeared from the tower was still alive and would come back and claim the throne. He was literally obsessed with this notion and it overtakes his life until he makes some decisions that leave him questioning himself and his humanity.<br /><br />As I said I enjoyed the novel. If you’re looking for pure facts you won’t find it in this novel but there is no doubt that Gregory can spin a tale that will hold a reader, or listener in my case, captive for hours – fifteen hours to be exact for the audio. I enjoyed reading about Elizabeth of York as I hadn’t read much about her before and my only complaint on her character in this novel would be that she seemed to be weak at times and it would have been nice to see her portrayed in a more lively fashion. I liked her though and I really liked her mother Elizabeth Woodville who was portrayed as strong, passionate, and determined to get a York back onto the throne where she felt they belonged. All in all a really enjoyable read for lovers of historical fiction or fans of Philippa Gregory.ared from the tower was still alive and would come back and claim the throne.

B00C7JG0KG|5.0|I have been a huge fan of the Wizard of Oz movies since I was a kid. I probably watched the wizard of oz nearly a thousand times over my 26 years because of its amazing staying power and magnificent story. That being said, I was skeptical of this new adventure into OZ and the review I had read did not help my skepticism. After watching this movie in 3D in my home, I can safely say that it was not as bad as others claim. The actors were chosen very well, the amazing detail and colors were vibrant and inspiring, and I loved the 3D effects. I believe that this lined up really well with the Wizard of OZ, but I actually hope they look at remaking the entire OZ chronicles. They have a great start with this movie and a would look forward to seeing future OZ adventures using today's technology. I am not going into as much detail simply because I don't want to spoil the fun of this movie. If I had to give one down side to this movie it was that I couldn't help but say &#34;Shut up Meg&#34; at different times. It was not Mila Kunis's fault, she did really well, but I have family guy embedded into my mind. Bottom line is this is a movie worth buying if you are an OZ fan, and the 3D really didn't feel like a gimmick as it does in other movies.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show even the second time around.  We will miss Matthew!!  If you have never seen it, do yourself a favor and buy it.
1452126577|5.0|My kitties are reading this, too. They are getting more grumpy by the day. So am I. Haha. Buy it. Fun read.
B000OY8NII|5.0|IT WAS GREAT TO REVISIT EUREKA. ACTORS WERE GREAT. THE STORIES EACH TOLD WAS A GOOD LESSON. GREAT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. FUNNY AND INTERESTING.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Excellent and never disappointing. Best series on TV now and in a very long time!!!! Worth keeping and collecting all seasons.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|THE ACTORS WAS REALLY CLOSE TO THE ORGINAL PEOPLE.  THE STORY KEPT ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. THE MOVIE WILL SUPRISE YOU. IT DID ME. THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL ENJOY IT. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I enjoy these DVDs over and over again. There is always something new to laught that you may not have caught when you watched it the first time. What a perfect team  of comedians!!!!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Everyone should own one of these! It has saved my phone a million times! I drop my phone almost daily and take it sailing and to the beach! This case is so durable and awesome that my cell has never even got a scratch on it!if I didn't have this case I would have went through 10 phones already!its way better than the competitors as well, and I know cause I've tried them all!
0525478817|3.0|My son has to read this book as a summer reading assignment for the new school year. Although it is well written I found it to be very depressing. As an adult reading the book, I felt the content was very good. However, I feel it is very sad to start the school year reading this book
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|guys please get this. if your device has low internal storage but you don't have music, videos, movies, etc. you should get this app.
0790729725|3.0|After binging on The Sopranos, GoodFellas fell short of my expectations.  Does anyone know how to write anything but a 1-word dialogue?
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Great case for the money. The material and make is very solid. For the price I would buy it again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was very happy with both the picture and sound quality of the program, rate excellent. Thank you very much.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|having this app is great, you might not see everything from the kindle that you would on the actual computer, but it still keeps you connected.
B0041D843M|5.0|If you ever wanted to cut through the hype and get to the science of nutrition....Campbell will hold your hand and slog through the crap with you. It is a real conversation starter if you let your mind be opened to the possibility that you have been duped by media for years...<br />Look to the facts and you might just see the truth.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|I would have to say this movie is great! Definitely for anyone who is into some future end of the world sci-fi type of movies, its orginial and makes u think
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Found the book fascinating, particularly from the medical perspective. In an odd sort of way I found the book to be comforting. I recognize Dr Alexander took a risk in writing this book , as he placed himself in the vulnerable position of potentially receiving a great deal of criticism from his colleagues. Since I live an hour away from Dr Alexander I know some of  the Physicians mentioned and have a great deal of respect for them. That in itself lends credence to  his book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun to play. You need to concentrate a bit to find the matches. I`'ve played this game on the computer for years so this is a new version for me.
006114665X|3.0|A bit detailed for the average reader. Goes into extreme detail about the beginning of the war.  You have to be a college professor to appreciate the work.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|You do not win enough on this game.  I do not like that kind of games.  I like the ones you can win on.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really good game but I have an iPhone to and I have minecraft there and there are a lot of updates but in the kindle one there are none but still a very good game
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its a fun mystery type game. keeps u on ur toes as to if u can figure out the next clue in the correct order. no instructions but that's what makes it intriguing
B005P5TQPU|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV. Its kind of like the X-Files but I think even better. Good, creepy stories with likable sometimes funny characters.
B002M5E2DW|5.0|The secret has changed my life!  I use positive thought for everything and can't believe how my outlook and personality have changed.  I tell everyone I know about it, and will continue to do so!!!  Thank you Rhonda Byrne for sharing The Secret!!
B001OKCPI0|4.0|Good movie. Almost seems like it could happen. Spooky without being too gory. Interesting, unique backstory. Good twists to it. Keeps your attention.
B009A87ZQU|5.0|I never thought I would like some other actor more than Sean Connery as James Bond, but Dsniel Craig is now my favorite Bond. The Bond movies with Craig have the type of realism and action as in the TV series \\"24\\", an example bring this movie's airport chase.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|Now is one of my daughter's favorite movies. She hardly likes movies, but now I have this one to add to her list.
B008Y6MKSW|4.0|I love this movie. A great life lesson wrapped in some funny stuff. Reminds you what's really important when you get stuck on life's treadmill.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun To Play But Also Easy To Pick Up Or Down As needed...Definitely A Keeper...Though You Should Definitely Have A Screen Protector
B003YVCJQ0|4.0|Great action. Story of love, honor, and salvation. Lots of explosions... but, no gun violence. This is a really good family movie.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. Wasn't what I thought it would be. I would recommend it to every one.
B000ID3KU6|5.0|This is Sergio Leone at his best. Charles Bronson, Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, et al portray a superb plot, story, and the whole thing comes together with an outstanding sound track.
B005LLX582|4.0|I must admit that I had to watch it twice to really see its beauty. It's a gorgeous work, beautiful done and extremely moving.
B00448VST6|5.0|Great Music. Fun characters. More video game jokes and insider easter eggs than you can shake a stick at. It would be hard for me to overemphasize how much I love this movie.
B0006HBZXS|4.0|Great movie. Excellent performances by Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin. I wish they could work together more! Oldie but goodie.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele's music is the best music of today!  This CD is worth buying and provides such pleasant listening music, you can find me in my kitchen having a glass of wine and listening to Adele!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I grew up watching the off-the-wall creative movies: Labyrinth, Never-Ending Story, etc.  I enjoy this story of corruption in Oz and the characters made me fell in love with them.  I always wanted to find pail lunches hanging in a tree.  I wanted a pet chicken.  I kept a diary key on a black silk/satin string tied around my wrist.  The only thing in this movie that every truly terrified me were the Wheelers.  As newer interpretations of the flying monkeys, they did truly scare me.  Despite feeling only mild-apprehension when I see them now, the enchantment of the story is what keeps me coming back.  Fairuza was an excellent choice for the roll, and RTO makes the Emerald City feel more realistic than TWOO ever did for me (no disrespect to Judy).
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this for my son and he was thrilled to have it!  This whole CD has some good music on it!
B001PPLIFU|5.0|Hard to admit, but Sean Connery has been bested.  Craig's Bond is full of dark heroism and I think that makes the difference in the performance.  This is a GREAT sequel to Casino Royale, and really brings forward the truth of third world conditions and first world exploitation.  Craig continues his masterful performance and does so looking classy, sexy, and VERY dangerous.  007 has entered the 21st century.
B00081U7HC|5.0|This is my absolute favorite movie of all time --- I love Richard Gere!  Julia Roberts gives a perfect performance of grace and style in this movie --- a must have for romance individuals.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my brother.  We had seen the movie in theaters and it is EXCELLENT.  Amazing story, acting, camera-work, etc.  If you haven't seen it, do so.  It's been a long time coming for a great movie where you root for the &#34;good&#34; bad guy.  Ben Afleck earns his cred with this movie.  And the Blu-Ray features are great (picture, special features, etc.).  A must-own for any Crime Thriller fan!
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie! Didnt think I'd would be into it but I loved it and can't wait for the next one!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|One of my favorite HBO miniseries.  Adams is my favorite President, historically and Giamatti brings him to life!  Linney is amazing as Abigail, and Wilkinson as Franklin and Morse as Washington are perfectly cast.  The soundtrack is beautiful (I also own), and was used in the 2012 election coverage by CNN, I believe.  There are some historical liberties taken.  You understand why John Q. was less effective as a President and how Adams relationship with Jefferson, Franklin, and Washington were unique.  There are parallels between 19th century Adams and 20th century Truman that become more evident throughout the series.  By the end, you have met a man who always believed America could be better, if it only made the decision to.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I went camping with my family and had it on my Kindle. I couldn't put the thing down. I kept reading it and ended up finishing it that weekend.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Hard to admit, but Sean Connery has been bested. Craig's Bond is full of dark heroism and I think that makes the difference in the performance. Casino Royale is an excellent starting point in the new series.  Your drawn in by Craig's &#34;devil may care&#34; attitude and Dench's beautiful, hard nose delivery. Craig creates a masterful performance and does so looking classy, sexy, and VERY dangerous. 007 has entered the 21st century.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I love it......it's one of my favorite series!  Course the evil queen REALLY gets on my nerves but the characters are fantastic.  Hopefully it will continue for several more years.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like so many others, we fell in love with Susan.  She covers some of the greats: Madonna, The Rolling Stones, The Monkees, etc.  Her voice is shining and her story is even brighter.  If you haven't seen the story and audition of Susan Boyle for the UK's X Factor, then you should YouTube them now and become a fan immediately.  You are missing out!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing solitaire over and over again. A great way to occupy my time when there is nothing to do. Would recommend solitaire to anyone....
B003H6KRIE|5.0|This series is AMAZING!  Robert Ludlum's book, converted into a post-9/11 world is excellent and gives a nice spin post-Cold War.  The storylines are strong and keep the viewer drawn in.  Damon's stunts are unreal and with the recent Wiki and NSA leaks about government espionage, you understand that there really are Jason Bournes out there.  Bought this a a gift for my brother.  He loves!  Blu-Ray is ALWAYS excellent quality.  Highly recommend for the action, drama, and story.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It had a great story line and very important lessons.  There was nothing that I disliked.  I would recommend it to anyone
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|It's very addicting. Only problem I have is not having enough coins to keep playing. Other than that, I could play during all my free time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a great series!  We are looking forward to the current season and hope there are many more!!! A must see.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Enjoyed this.  Mr. Mc  did a great job.  I would watch this one again.  I was glad he did not die at the end of the movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So well done.  LOVED IT.  Can't wait for the next season to start. Watched season 1-3 in a course of one month.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It is great to be able to leave feedback on sold or purchased items; takes time to upload pics to list an item but other than that it is awesome

B0067RQYNW|5.0|I was totally frustrated when trying to open a new document on my Kindle in the Apache Open Office Suite that comes with the Fire. There was no way I could figure to do this. When I checked for &#34;help&#34; I saw that people were using Kingsoft in combination with Office Suite. I downloaded Kingsoft and bingo I could open a new document. I haven't used Kingsoft much (keyboard on tblets not the most conducive to volume typing) but so far it seems to work fine.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|This is am entertaining story that requires your attention if you want to fully enjoy the characters and nuances as they develop.

B0041D843M|1.0|Observational studies must not be used to draw conclusions.  They can show correlation.  Not cause.  Also, analyse the data yourself.  This is bunk.
B003UESJFQ|5.0|Like this movie a lot, i had heard about it and it's a good movie on the history of women fighting for what they do to build England.  fast delivery too
B000NHPCS0|5.0|Be prepared, much violence, great romantic plot, outstanding cast.  I had the purchase the movie when I got home from work<br />just to see the ending!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a wonderful book ,,, Gave history along with different stories that crossed paths throughout the book and easy to keep up with as the different stories developed.  Very magical...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really believe that this book has changed my life for the better. I feel as if I can really relate to most of this. This makes me happy
B000W8HC8I|4.0|Fast moving book. Would like to have understood what happened between Day 1 on Wall St to the time that he set up his own firm, but what wasa covered was really fascinating - the journey always explains the detination

B004FECNIO|4.0|A.I. Artificial Intelligence is an interesting look at the future. Two robots (who resemble humans in every way) go on an adventure to discover who they are.

Every single extra from the 2-Disc Widescreen DVD and Japanese BD release seems to be included (~95 minutes) but exclusive content is not offered on this release.

B001BPQT8A|4.0|Se7en is about two detectives (a rookie and a veteran) who hunt a serial killer who uses the seven deadly sins as his modus operandi. Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey are all excellent in this crime-mystery. This film is ranked #22 in the Top 250 Movies at IMDB and was nominated for one Oscar. The video and audio quality on the Seven 2010 BD are very good. No new content for Blu-Ray but we do get the extras ported over from the 2004 2-disc DVD. The longest featurette is 23 minutes. The big advantage here is the 4 audio commentaries otherwise the bonus content is short. This great film is sadly lacking a 90-minute documentary on the making of the movie.<br /><br />Special Features on BD:<br />4 Commentaries Featuring Director David Fincher, Actors Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman and Other Collaborators on the Film<br />Additional/Extended Scenes (19 min)<br />Alternate Endings (13 min)<br />Exploration of the Opening Title Sequence from Multiple Video Angles with Various Audio Mixes and 2 Commentary Tracks<br />Production Design and Still Photographs with Commentaries<br />The Notebooks: Full MotionVideo Details &#34;John Doe's&#34; Writings<br />Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />Buy this film.

B003L16FAE|2.0|Arnie is on a rescue mission in a remote South American jungle. The 2010 Ultimate Hunter Edition includes 13 minutes (2 shorts) of HD exclusive content. There is a total of roughly 90 minutes of supplemental content and two full commentaries (which totals over 5 hours of \\"bonus content\\"). Bonus features seen on the 2004 two-disc special edition DVD are ported over. The exclusive content is fairly bland so more extras could have made this even better. This is a 5 star movie in a 2 star release.<br /><br />IGN identified Predator as one of the Top 25 Worst-Blu Ray releases. \\"Biggest Flaw: Too much digital noise reduction. If you want to witness the absolute most damning affects that digital noise reduction can bring to a film, give Fox's Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition a spin. My, oh, my is it terrible. The film was basically scrubbed of any grain or noise, resulting in a picture that almost looks like it comes from a video source, transferred over to hi-def. Textures are completely lost, depth is flattened, and pretty much every scene looks ugly and repressed by this very annoying, and often over-used, digital tool. Don't want to take our word for it? Fine. Just pop in the original no-frills Blu-ray and watch any scene in the film. Then pop in the double-dip and compare. If you don't see a difference, you are blind! While this double-dip Blu-ray gave fans all the bonus features they craved, it betrayed them in a big way.\\"<br /><br />The first Blu-ray release of Predator was a bare-bones package so this may not be the ultimate upgrade fans were expecting. More effort in the transfers and more HD bonuses could have made the Ultimate Hunter Edition even better. If you really like Predator then consider purchasing the Predator Trilogy on Blu-Ray (with two more movies) instead. It includes ALL of the bonus content in this release. If you don't want the sequels at all then UHE is good value for your money if you can accept the limitations. The Predator Trilogy on Blu-Ray does not correct any problems but gives you two more films. Predator 3D was released Dec/2013 but no remastering was performed.does not correct any problems but gives you two more films. Predator 3D was released Dec/2013 but no remastering was performed.

0399255370|5.0|Highly recommend this great book. My 6 year old granddaughter loves it so much. She reads it all the time.
0756405890|2.0|the story is ok, i guess....but having seen the content of the sequel, i'm not continuing this new series. too much violent and sexual content for me....if author writes anything new, i might read it, depending on reviews.<br />the story also meanders around, and the sequel is worse in this way, maybe ok for most people, but new series - this one and others - are just getting too long and are not being edited well - just my opinion, and you can pretty much skip the middle few hundred pages!
0345529057|5.0|From some of the other reviews I thought they would fall apart, but for the price I had to at least check it out.  They are FANTASTIC!  $40.00 worth of books for $15.00.  Yes please!  I was 3/4 of the way through one of them before the spine even began to show any amount of wear and they are holding up just fine for me!  Great product, great price and of course, great writing.  More Tyrion!  WOOHOO!

1119963192|5.0|I wish these guys had coaches in the USA. Really liked that they don't treat everyone the same. They do a great job describing the different types of swimmers and different ways to improve by type. It helped me recognize and overcome elbow issues. That alone made it worth it.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I did not expect this game to be very good. I installed it for my 7 yr old but after a few levels it was way too frustrating for her. In my attempts to help her, I fell in love. Smooth, no bugs, no ads sitting on the screen where you need to tap. A great combination of unique, challenging and simple. Totally deserves 5 stars.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|My grandson loves this app.I haven't been able to download books because he monopolizes my kindle.Great product ! Would recommend it for almost any age group over 5.
B003ZYJS5Q|5.0|This box sets a very high standard that other companies should follow. The quality is very high from sleeves, jackets, and vinyl. Although I would prefer a different sleeve the whole box screams quality. I am not a Dylan fan per se,  but this was a wonderful way to hear him grow as both a writer and artist. I would recommend to any music fan and in Mono which is the way these albums should be heard.<br />Regards

B007SZ0E1K|4.0|This is a great processor and runs like a beast!<br />I was actually thinking of an i7 considering it's the &#34;new and the best out there,&#34; but this definitely is a better buy and just as good.
B0002I831S|4.0|I bought this some time ago, but just finished watching the entire first season.  There was a slight scratch on one of the discs, but I can no longer return so I'll live with it.<br /><br />I watched the original series when I was a teen so it's nice to see all the episodes again (and uncut like they are on reruns today!).  Episodes are about 49-50 minutes each.  The volume seems a bit low compared to live TV, but I just turn up the volume when watching the DVDs.<br /><br />So glad I finally bought these . . . been wanting them for years.
0525478817|5.0|This book was one that I tried to avoid reading at first because I know that the story, kind of hits home. My younger brother was diagnosis with cancer four years ago, and although he is healthy now (I am grateful everyday for this, even when he is being a moody teenager) I can never forget that dark time in my life when everyday I wondered if this day will be his last. With that said, I also notice that this book is one of John Green's most popular, and since I loved the other two books that I have read from him (Paper Towns, Looking for Alaska) I wanted to give this one a try.<br /><br />Well, I absolutely loved this book. It was amazing from start to finish. First off, I love John's or should I say Hazel's take on cancer and death. She gets annoyed with people viewing cancer patients as being these wholly beings only capable of of good, and how powerful these patients' strength are. In reality, cancer sucks, and those who are not sick feel uncomfortable around those that are. They don't want to be seen as these warriors, but as normal people and that can truly never be. I like how honest Hazel is, and how John portrays her as a teenager who wants to live life rather than a cancer patient waiting for death to take her away in his chariot. She is honest, funny, and strong-all of these traits having nothing to do with her sickness, but in the person that she is. Hazel is not a girl with cancer, she is just a girl.<br /><br />Augustus Waters, oh my goodness, one of my favorite characters ever...in any book. His sense of humor, charm, and outlook on life shines through the pages. I wish I could meet someone like him in real life, someone who makes the world better just by merely existing.<br /><br />The characters, this world, and their troubles are all very vivid and real. I came into this book, excepting to be really depressed-as the topic of cancer is always saddening-but I didn't except to also laugh and fall in love with these characters. At such a young age, Hazel, Augustus and Issac know more about life than most people do.<br /><br />There was quite some twists and turns in this book, and there were times when the reveals were made that really surprised me.<br /><br />Out of all the books I've read, and being a book lover I have read many, I have not encountered characters like the ones in this book. Characters that are so real and charismatic despite their situations, characters that refuse to live inside a book, characters that demand to be analyzed and remembered, and characters that I know will always stay with me.<br />The Fault in Our Stars, is fantastic, but then again I wouldn't expect any less from John Green.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film is one that you are able to watch over and over. It is well made and the acting is good. It will have you crying one minute and laughing the next. The message conveyed to fathers is well worth the watch. It is a great movie good for the whole family.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was looking for something to watch during the weekend and this series came up under the Prime search in the Horror genre. I have to say, that I have never been so intrigued by a show like this for a while. I watched season 1 in about a weekend and started season 2 shortly after. The series in short just gives me chills! The acting is very convincing and you become extremely invested in the characters that they become short of a family member of yours. Watch it and you will see what I mean. This will not disappoint!
B004XNGKBS|3.0|I wish I could save the documents between my devices. Would also be PERFECT if I could import my forms and fill them in with the pen option. Otherwise does its job.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is Very Addicting Fun!  :)  Great for hand eye coordination.....but we just compete to see who can collect the most bananas.

1451627297|5.0|I have been reading Stephen King books since I was in my 20's. When I was laid up with a broken back for 8 weeks, my brother gave me some of the Dark Tower audio books to listen to. It hooked me completely. 11/22/63: A Novel becomes better and better each time I read it. Yes, I re-read all my books (good because I buy them). When a new Stephen King book comes out, I all but gobble the book down! This book took me a while to get into the rhythm of the tale. But again, laid up last summer with a foot operations, I re-read this book and was floored by Stephen King's writing talents. People think he only writes creepy stories (he does write lots of creepies - the best!), but some of his most striking books haven't been about traditional horror. Shawshank Rendemption, The Green Mile, and also 11/22/63. This book contains horror, but it's the horror all America lived when Kennedy was assasinated. I think everyone has thought about what they would do if they could go back in time. Saving Kennedy I think is one most folks may have thought about. We don't know what would have happened had he lived. Would 'Camelot' have continued? Would his indescretions be his downfall? Here is a man who actually sets out to do just that. His tale is filled with lots of details of the background on what Texas was like, Oswald details that I never really knew and mostly how innocent most people were during that period. Since Jake comes from our time, he is surprised to be charmed by the people he meets and learns to love. The facts of the real assasination and King's fiction are almost seamless. And the outcome of this huge change and other changes that Jake makes while using the time portal multiple times are scary, interesting and make you think twice about going back in time if you had the chance.<br /><br />I am a Stephen King fan of many years. I love all of his books, love his short stories and except for the Bachman Books (I have those bookos but they were a struggle to read those letme tell you) I have them all. Of course the Dark Tower is his triumph. If you want something amazing to invest your time in - read the Dark Tower novels. Stephen King is never better than in those books. He is by far one of the best writers of our time. Those who think he only writes about spooky stuff have missed so much of King's magic. His ability to make his characters so real, so life like that you picture people you know when he creates a character. Coming from New England (NH), I am so pleased with how he nails the New England character so aptly. And humoursly. He has a great sense of fun that shows often in his works. And he is one of the best writers who writes from a woman's point of view and does it well! His female characters are rarely the tepid, needy, pale images that often show up in literature. I give him more than two thumbs up for this book, 11/22/63 - I give him two high fives. This book made me interested in the real history surrounding the time of Kennedy's assasination. I was 2 at the time and he really did capture the time and the people so well in this novel. A must read? Absolutely. I give it 5 stars. His talent continues to amaze and entertain me. Keep it coming Steve!

0985557834|5.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed book one of Paracord Fusion Ties so much. It gave me a great variety of projects to do to expand my knowledge of paracord projects, and book two is even better. For those looking for how to make not just bracelets, but other survival projects, get this immediately. It is a great way to make some money, while doing something that's hard to not love doing.

I thought it could never be topped.<br />I caught this performance by accident on PBS this past weekend, and I have to admit I was wrong.<br />This cast was superb. The chemistry between the Phantom and Christine was breathtaking.<br />The singing was heavenly. The acting, especially from Ramin, was beyond compare.<br />THIS is the performance everyone should see. My soul was deeply moved.
B00CBSDQ9Q|3.0|Basically, began watching after enjoying \\"Don't Stop Believing\\" remake video from pilot. Although considered mostly a \\"teen dramedy\\" I strongly suspect older adults enjoyed Season 1-3 due to great song arrangements from different genres and decades and strong acting ability from diverse characters. The show had an overall good message of acceptance due to the diverse nature of characters. Most knew the students did not look 15(exception \\"Curt\\") and likely no one cared. There was chemistry between characters, esp. Lea Michelle and Cory Monteith (Rachael and Finn.) The show was funny with it's quirky humor, esp. Jane Lynch as Coach Sue Sylvester. Perhaps her portrayal as ultra-conservative coach of the Nat'l ranked cheerleaders set on destroying \\"Mr. Shue's\\" (Mark Morrison)Glee Club seemed more outrageously funny knowing her character's portrayal couldn't be more opposite than her real life (based on interviews). Each character was well-developed. The show took on controversial subjects with each season gradually tackling more sensitive, emotionally charged subjects. Season 4 comes in with a whimper. Realizing many are resistant to change, I decided at least to watch. By ep. 18, \\"Shooting Star\\" I realized it wasn't simply due to favorites leaving. There was so much talent in 1-3, including rival teams. Rather than find similar replacements for characters already established, loved by their fans, the creators' should have introduced new characters. High School and/or the world is full of interesting people. IMO, Marley was the only character to rival old standards. The music was less diverse. I never read about ratings, but I'm guessing by bringing in the former characters during the holidays, the ratings were slipping. Most likely, teens still enjoyed. They deserve shows geared towards them. But, if enjoyed by teens AND older adults, why change or fix what's not broken? I was angry episode 18 \\"Shooting Star\\" used school shooting as a platform for gun control (which I'm for). The 2 subjects, seemingly \\"thrown\\" together, completely minimized the effect on the students. The  student's effects alone should have been one episode. Rather,it was wrapped up in a couple of statements, Sue's \\"confession\\" ending with the message she was protecting a student and fired as an unsung hero. This one episode had enough material to cover an entire season. IMO, this episode best represents why the show has seemingly strayed from aspects making it a hit. Season 4 is sloppy, not as well-written or acted and difficult to care about the new characters. Glee should have ended on a high note after season 3 and created a spin-off with former characters. Perhaps, as in many past high school shows, rename it \\"Glee - The Next Class\\" or similar. S.4 which feels more like a platform for Hollywood's personal's agenda rather than an entertaining show featuring diverse characters sending a positive message of acceptance through extraordinary talent of song, dance, acting and comedy.m for).

B00CFYAT6O|4.0|This followup to 2011s searing debut, Relelator is no let down. My first pass of the CD on a road trip to LA had me playing cutts over and over again. The soulful Sweet and Low, R & B / big band Made up Mind, and Susan belting it out in Do I Look Worried. Not a dud in this line up of gems. Derek as expected was flawless in his performances. Not enough can be said about his slide work with alittle more Zydeco (Sonny Langreth like, but still original) rasp to his sound this time. If you liked round one of the husband wife team JUST BUY THIS CD and dig in.

The sticker or decal on he front doesn't stay on very well so I recommend some two sided 3M tape for that.

B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I generally don't write a review for a book. This one forced me to.<br />It starts confusing...becomes interesting somewhere in the middle while still being confusing and towards the end - the writer killed the story.<br /><br />I was planning to give the book 4 stars but by the time I reached its end I hated the book and horrible end. I could have come up with a better end... come on !!<br />I wanted to finish the book quick so I could watch the movie in theaters - now I will wait for it on netflix (no hurries) ........

Listening to Billy Sheehan jam out on his Bass brings me back to my days seeing Mr. Big perform in NYC, Kotzen makes me definitely search for any of his old recordings (I can't believe I was barely familiar with him before) and Mike F***in Portnoy - are you kidding!!<br /><br />For any musicians out there, I'm sure you'll appreciate their craft and for people like myself who love good music almost more than anything, go out and buy this right away!!
6305313687|4.0|This movie really makes you think about things.  It is set so that the beginning the main character \\"Ed Norton\\" is one way but then as the movie goes on he changes.  It makes you see things in a different light.  I would recommend to anyone who has those types of views towards others because it can really be effective in changing your mind for the better.  Great movie.

B000C20VRS|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie.  The reason being is because it really does tell the tail of the American Dream (Illegal Dream That is).  It tells a story of Tony Montana who comes to America with nothing and rises through the ranks of the Cuban crime wave to become the most powerful Drug lord in the US.  He is the most ruthless criminal in any movie I have ever seen and Al Pacino can definitely pull it off.  I would recommend this movie to any person of any age (Over 18) of course because it is AMAZING!  BUY IT IF YOU GET THE CHANCE!
B0001GMIOE|5.0|I decided back in 2010 to purchase another Lithium Ion battery pack from Canon for my<br />EOS 20D Digital SLR camera. I was going to go to South Korea for 10 days and did not<br />want to take the charger, albeit small. I wanted to pack as light as possible and also not<br />worry about recharging the battery every other day. These batteries did not disappoint.<br /><br />During my trip I took copious amounts of digital photos and the 3 batteries held up well.<br />I had no problems with them and they held their charge throughout the 10 day trip. I must<br />have taken thousands of photos on the trip there and back. The batteries charge held<br />wonderfully. I will say that I rarely used the on-camera flash and that was probably helpful<br />in preserving the battery's charge.<br /><br />Nevertheless Canon makes a fine battery and I will continue to purchase their battery pack<br />once these run their course. I have been a Canon camera guy since the AE1 first came out<br />and have never looked back. Terrific products from a great company.<br /><br />Even today the same battery's are still going strong so I definitely recommend this battery<br />without any reservations. Have a good shoot.<br />.<br /><br />NOTE:  I decided to always buy from my batteries from Amazon and have always received<br />the 'official' Canon battery and not an imitation. It appears the imitations exist from what a<br />lot Amazon reviewers have been reporting, so be careful out there.
B000P0J09M|5.0|I like this movie because I am enthralled by the Gangster Movie Scene.  I am Italian and love the way the story starts from a guy being a nobody to becoming a someone to becoming a snitch.  Robert De Niro is AMAZING in this movie and I would recommend it to anyone.  No Joke

B0007DFJ0G|5.0|This movie made my top 5.  I love the fact that you can watch it over and over again and get something new from it each time.  It really makes you feel for Tyler and It is definitely a must have for any movie collector.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Even after 20 times of seeing it I still love it.  The plot is genius and it really makes you think about things differently.  Great flick.

1451696191|2.0|For all the hype on this book, the writing itself as well as the story was disappointing. I didn't enjoy the ending nor did I find the writing very in depth or detailed. Although, this is just my personal opinion, I know that many others have enjoyed this book so I understand that it is definetly a certain style of writing.
B000M341QE|5.0|Once again I have to say that I love the Gangster Movies.  Great flick and would recommend it to anyone :) The actors are amazing.  Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Leo DiCaprio are perfect for their roles in this movie.  I will say that if you are wanting this movie to see about Whitey Bulger than steer clear.  It does not represent his life in an accurate manner.  It makes him look humorous rather than what he really was.  Just saying.  But it is still amazing.
B0000C4LXG|5.0|Influenced equally by the likes of Sepultura, Hellhammer, Sarcofago, and Death as from Celtic Frost, Venom, and Mercyful Fate, the debut album from Norwegian black metal gods Mayhem, is as much a death metal album as it is a black metal one. Indeed, 1987's appropriately-named \\"Deathcrush\\" is much like Mayhem's eye-opening breakthrough release, \\"De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas,\\" in that sense. This E.P. is also like that 1994 album in that there is some experimentation sprinkled into the mix, here, but it is only just enough to keep things honest and prevent them from getting too one-dimensional and/or unpredictable.<br /><br />The vast majority of \\"Deathcrush\\" abides by one rule: Skull-crushing extremity. The album gets underway with \\"Silvester Anfang,\\" an ominous, not-quite-two-minute-long instrumental, and an extremely dark and portentous opener. It is comprised of surprisingly rhythmic and very martial-sounding percussion -- the whole song is just one drum solo. Next we have the album's title song, a breakneck death-thrasher that overflows with pummeling blast beats and frenzied buzzsaw riffing. As good as these two songs are, however, it is \\"Chainsaw Guts\\" that stands out the most among the record's first three tracks. It is a steady beating that abides by a forebodingly slow, bass-driven pace, and includes a noteworthy bass intro (a rare find in the black metal genre!).<br /><br />\\"Witching Hour\\" starts out at a similar-sounding pace, but soon morphs into hyperspeed blastmania territory, playing like a two-minute long blast of breathless, earth-scorching brutality. And the song is also of note for featuring some screwy, screaming guitar soloing. And \\"Necrolust\\" continues in this same vein, doling out gobs of memorable, thickly churning, and at times ferocious, string-bending picking, thrashing, chainsaw-fast rhythms, and walloping skins. \\"(Weird) Manheim\\" is an anomaly, an, uh, weird, but somehow simultaneously fitting instrumental interlude that is peppered with some astonishingly ambient keyboards and spots of near silence. But the album comes full circle by plummeting back into no-holds-barred brutality with the ensuing \\"Pure F'ing Armageddon,\\" a thunderously booming, carnage-inducing set closer.<br /><br />\\"Deathcrush\\" is a scant seventeen minutes and change, but even if it is a bit on the short side of the line, it still definitely gives the listener a lot of bang for their buck. It is easily one of the best E.P.'s of the 1980's, as it is also one of the decade's finest debuts. A must-have for all serious death and black metal connoisseurs.e astonishingly ambient keyboards and spots of near silence.

His solo music is always good and always fresh and new.  I like the drummer adding that real hard metal edge.  It really gives the album a completeness that I like.  James does a great job of giving you fresh music and still keep his voice the prominent voice in music no matter what style.
0374214913|3.0|\\"Mr. Penumbra's 24 Hour Bookstore\\" is a fun read, but by the end it comes across almost like a watered down DaVinci Code for young adults. It reminds me a little of the delightful \\"Ready Player One,\\" but is not quite as compelling. It does have some interesting things to say about technology, both of the past and the present, and of the limitations of both.<br /><br />Clay is an unemployed techie who sees a help wanted sign in the window of a dusty, out-of-the-way bookstore in San Francisco. He gets the job, but notices that Mr. Penumbra's is not just any ordinary bookstore. It is very narrow, but the bookshelves go up three stories, with amazingly tall rolling ladders for precarious access. Another thing about the store is that almost no one comes in for \\"regular\\" books. The clientele shows up at all hours looking for very specific books full of mysterious codes. It turns out that the bookstore is one of the bases of a secret society called the Unbroken Spine that has been trying to decipher the mysterious books for the past 500 years. Clay secretly applies modern technologies and enlists a friend at Google to help work out the code. This applying of modern techniques opens up its own can of worms with certain factions of the society and the race for an answer is on.<br /><br />I liked how the book honored both the \\"paper book\\" lovers and the technology crowd. The search techniques employed by Google are fascinating also. The story started out very interesting, but lost steam towards the end and I ended up being disappointed in the conclusion. The characters also lack depth, which might be forgiven if the author speeds towards a satisfying ending. Sloan ultimately doesn't, unfortunately.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: If the code was a simple substitution cipher, there is no way it would not be cracked by Google or scholars studying it for 500 years. Again Mr. Penumbra is a fun read, but it glosses over many details that could have made the work fascinating in the manner of \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" The author seems to opt for the short and fast read over depth. Also, besides translating the Latin book Clay provides, why would the Unbroken Spine continue after the code is broken? END SPOILER ALERT.<br /><br />Bothersome to me is the fact that so much research is done by other people. Being resourceful is good to a point, but has research devolved to the point where most just type queries into Google or Wikipedia and take someone else's word for it? What happened to firsthand research and experience?  I think \\"the Google Problem\\" has led to difficulties for many mystery writers of both the page and screen. How do you cope with the ready availability of information and instant communications everywhere? It instantly solves many problems that used to drive plots. Now the challenge for writers seems to be to come up with new plots that don't just lazily exploit the \\"get every answer from the magic box\\" solution of computers, a modern day form of Deus Ex Machina.<br /><br />There is promise here, and I would like to see another offering by Robin Sloan in the future.r of \\"The DaVinci Code.\\" The author seems to opt for the short and fast read over depth.

0316098515|2.0|this is a beautifully done book, but you must wear an apron and gloves to open it.  The food is more than just a little bit precious.  for the advanced cook there is a lot to be learned, but will probably never be put to use.
055358202X|3.0|The fourth tome in the series is really only a partial update on events since the last book. It covers only a portion of the characters still alive, focusing on Cersei, Arya, Sansa, and Brienne from the female contingent, and Samwell and Jamie, from the male side. If you are looking for significant updates on any of the characters, you will have to wait for the next book in the series. Overall, the plot continues the aftermath of the major battles with rising political factions where power vacuums have opened up and unrest beginning to build in the survivors. We see a new leader being chosen for the Iron Islands, political intrigue builds at King's Landing between two queens, Dorne has a princess with agenda to unbalance the power in Westeros, and the siege continues in the Riverlands. It is hard to go into much detail without giving much away, but suffice it to say that the author continues to deal death and destruction as he wishes, regardless of how major a character may seem, and is willing to completely drop a long developing plot line as well. While enormous in length, the alternating character chapters do help move the story along. Several of the characters that I really like and some others are left in dire straits by the end of the book, leaving you hanging for the next installment. I fear that one of my favorite characters may be doomed. Up until the last few chapters, there is not a lot of plot movement. While I appreciate the large scope of this series, it can be frustrating to deal with, especially with the considerable time investment involved in reading these books.
006224454X|2.0|This is one of the most disappointing thrillers I've read in recent years. The premise is solid: a woman wakes up one morning in bed with a middle-aged man and has no idea who she or the man are, or where she is. It's quickly established that she's in London and suffers from both \\"regular\\" and anterograde amnesia, that is to say, she can't remember most of her past, and nor can she store new memories. Early on, a psychologist secretly convinces her to start keeping a journal, and thus, through this journal she is able to start piecing together who she is, who the man is, and what happened to her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of this is thriller in the slightest, nor even very interesting. The bulk of the book is supposed to be her actual journal, but it's written unlike any journal I've ever seen, with full conversations recorded verbatim. In fact, it reads like a novel and ends up feeling quite clumsy. Because of her condition, we have to go through many repeated instances of her waking, freaking out, having her condition explained to her, etc. Now, I realize this is necessary in order to plant the clue and information necessary for later, but it's also quite tedious to wade through over and over. The real problem, however, is that one basically reads this kind of book to get to the big \\"twist\\" or revelation at the end. But that twist is entirely obvious and predictable from very early on -- so obvious and predictable that even when it happens, I kept expecting a double-twist, because the first one was so \\"meh\\". But that never comes, and instead we get a syrupy, rosy wrapup.<br /><br />And of course, the elephant in the room is that this condition has been used at the basis for both a gripping film thriller ([[ASIN:B004FHCH96 Memento]]) and an underrated rom-com ([[ASIN:B000EZ7ZXQ 50 First Dates]]), so it doesn't even have a fresh scent about it. That hasn't stopped a film version, due out next year (starring Nicole Kidman, Colin Firth, and Mark Strong).
B00E8B1358|4.0|Despite the widely publicized negative reviews of the first G.I. Joe film, I enjoyed it and I also enjoyed G.I. Joe Retaliation.  The plot line moves along at a healthy pace, the opening of the film gives a brief summation of events that have occurred since the first film and a short bio of the main characters.  While I was disappointed that *SPOILER ALERT* they killed off the main character of Duke, I understood it was a plot point to help serve the motivation of the characters in the story.<br /><br />I understand that Hollywood, like any business, has to go where it gets the best value for its money - that said the biggest disappointment for the film, for me, was when the story moved to Fort Sumter in South Carolina for a nuclear summit of world leaders.  I was born and raised in South Carolina and have visited Fort Sumter many times, so I was dismayed to see that it was not Fort Sumter featured in the film - but instead was Fort Pike in New Orleans, Louisiana.  Again, I get that Louisiana probably afforded Hollywood the best price break to film there, but it would have been nice to have had the story at least be adjusted to reflect that it was not Fort Sumter they were going to.<br /><br />All of this being said, the story was exactly what one would expect from a summer movie, lots of action, great special effects, and explosions that deliver as advertised.

1451648537|5.0|\\"Steve Jobs\\" is biographical writing at its best. The author has crafted a compelling, frank portrait of a man who was very complex, brilliant, and at times, not very nice. Regardless of how the reader feels about Jobs and Apple, this biography is a true pleasure to read. I immersed myself in both the audiobook and the (Kindle) book for more than two months. I savored every page because I am fascinated by how  a genius creates a work of art--specifically how Isaacson wove together the multitude of interviews, his research, and Jobs's contributions. Sentence by sentence, Isaacson reveals his subject not all at once, but in stages making it seem as if the reader is becoming Jobs as Jobs becomes Jobs as he encounters his successes and struggles.<br /><br />In a literary world populated with biographies, autobiographies, and memoirs, \\"Steve Jobs\\" stands out, for me, as one of the four within this genre that are truly artistic.  The other three are \\"Unbroken\\", \\"American Prometheus\\", and \\"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl\\".  These three biographies and one autobiography are carefully crafted verbal portraits of individuals who were truly remarkable.  In each case, the authors create an ambiance that pulls in readers and compels them to take the journey with the subject as well as with the author. These authors clearly loved and admired their subjects, and that is evident in the care that they took to craft their books.<br /><br />Of course, it is rare that biographers get to interact with their subjects, and some readers may suspect that the authors become biased either towards or against their subject. The consequences being sugarcoating or exaggerating faults and foibles. Not so with Isaacson. He shows us Jobs as he was--the good and the not-so-good. He remains neutral and presents Jobs as Jobs represented himself, and as his family and colleagues perceived him. In conclusion, \\"Steve Jobs\\" flourishes because of this attentive integration of perspectives and analysisof an American icon. \\"Steve Jobs\\" the biography deserves a place in the American literary canon as an example of literary art.

This book has become a lifeline for myself, a now middle-aged over-achiever, and for the friends I'm sharing it with. For those who flog ourselves daily with inner chants of \\"work hard. work smart. be a success\\" this book shows us how we are actually flogging ourselves straight into despair.

These people must be engineers as there was too many points and processes and the examples not having the real name of the company made me loose interest in the example. Using a police department as one of the main uses of a Blue Ocean was a big miss when a good company could have saved this book. Oh well I will savior the theory a use it with real companies and look for it.

B00632HWOG|5.0|I bought these as my sons gym shoes for Kindergarten and they stand out and look great!! I ended up buying a whole size larger from reading other reviews. I got them and they are a bit longer than I'd hoped, but he has 9 months to grow into them. Next time a half size increase would ne perfect. Pumas are definately made for narrower feet though, so if you have a wide footed child, I can understand ordering up a whole size. :)
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I knew I was going to love this book just a few pages in.  The line that did it for me was \\"My father was himself a college professor and a pedant to the bone...To this day, the Socratic Method makes me want to bite someone.\\"<br />I thought this book was funnny, warm, very interesting.  I enjoyed everything about it.  Several things the author mentioned in the book (mostly relating to psychology experiments) sent me to google to learn more.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00EFNXPFK|3.0|John Mayer was one of my favorite artists, but just as he has moved on with his music, so must I as a fan.  I really liked him pre-Continuum days, loved him on Continuum but post Continuum, I find it hard to relate.  Yes, I can appreciate the blues, country and folk overtones of Paradise Valley and Born and Raised along with his introspective vocals.  What I cannot do, and Lord knows I tried, is find this new sound dynamic, exciting or fun to listen along.  After so many \\"plays\\", I just do not have the desire to keep either of his last two CD's in my active play list. I am hoping some day he will go back to his \\"old school\\" sound, but sadly enough I doubt this will happen.  For the time being, we have to part as friends, with the hope that someday we can rekindle this relationship.
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|If you were lucky enough to grab the Made in Germany metal box set I can understand having all of the videos already and not caring for this. But as a Rammstein lover and collector, this DVD is a must have. Hope they put out one last live DVD though. All of the videos I fell in love with, finally collaborated.
B000L43AN4|5.0|This collection really embodies what Tom Waits is about.  There is a lot of material here and it also covers a lot of ground.  The CD is well organized as one might expect from the subtitle and a lot of the tunes will sound familiar to listeners because some were placed &#34;elsewhere&#34; prior to landing on this collection.  The packaging and adorning photography recalls the trapping of the bygone vinyl days.  From start to finish, this has become one of my favorite Waits disks.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|The idea that the author shows that the Bible shows Christ as a pacifist is foreign to me.  I don't think it does.  In fact I think that the Bible very specifically shows Jesus as a rule breaker.  I also think you can't look at Jesus without examining and recognising the divinity of Christ.  Instead the author debunks Jesus as the Christ and sees the Bible largest were my as fiction
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I love this book series. And I can't wait to see the movie. Hopefully they put alot of the books details in it.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Good story line, sub-par acting.  It would have been better with unknown actors.  (That includes the monkey - sorry, Zach.)
