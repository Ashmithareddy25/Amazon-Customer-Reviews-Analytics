B0040I09RM|5.0|I was a latecomer to this show and have been watching episodes on my Kindle. I cannot get over how good it is! Jackson &#34;Jax&#34; Teller is a character who scares you and turns you on all in the same breath. If you aren't watching this show you are missing out on the best thing on television!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a terrific romp through history with likable characters! The humor was just what I needed in my life. It truly tells us all not to take life so seriously.
B00026ZG10|4.0|What can one say about the phenomenon of an Austrian born Body becoming a mega movie star and then Governor of a State in the Union with more people than most countries-and, then, after nearly 7 years at that job, resumes work as a  megastar who has just had a brief vacation from his movie work. This nearly twenty year old film epitomizes the basis for his continuing success. He and the people he has trusted to do the job, have created an image which he can get into and create an aura of power, while all about him carry the acting roles. That's not a knock; it takes skill to build on little native skill for a job and grow into it to a degree which allows the multitudes of many nations to  buy into the imagery.<br />This is just another entertaining, on the whole, humorous outing where Mr. S. soars above the crowd of ordinary mortals, giving us an image of invincibility and over-all mastery of men and women. Jamie Lee Curtis does a good job as Carol Burnett doing a skit with Harvey Korman as her husband (played by A.S.), Tom Arnold as his chief assisting Federal agent is just fine, while the remainder of the cast do their job of supporting the Big Man.<br />If  you want knock-a-bout comedy and slam-bang action this should be entertaining.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I Enjoy this very much. One of my all-time favorites. Johnny Cash is a legend and I'm so happy to have this cd in my library.
B008JFUO36|5.0|I really liked this movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays a man two weeks away from completing his maintenance duties on an earth outpost. Earth has basically been demolished by aliens, and he's living with a women who was posted there with him. There almost ready to go back to civilization on another planet (Titan) when twists and turns ensue, but I can't be more specific than that without giving spoilers.<br /><br />Here's why I liked it:<br /><br />- The story was creative, interesting and full of unexpected twists. Lots of mystery.<br /><br />- The characters were fairly well developed. You're led to care about them.<br /><br />- The movie held my attention throughout, and had that \\"edge of your seat\\" feel at times.<br /><br />- The cast was fantastic.<br /><br />- The effects were realistic, and the story believable and interesting.<br /><br />I did feel that the script could have had you caring about the characters more intensely. Still, it was very entertaining, and it's one I'll definitely want to watch it again.<br /><br />I recommend it to all scifi fans.
B009NX409M|4.0|It was entertaining to see these two mega stars performing together when they were younger.  The story is a wonderful, heartwarming romance, the kind which one doesn't find anymore.
B001VLXNO2|5.0|This book was well written and kept my attention even though I am not a fan of history.  I loved it.  There is love, intrigue, and personal interactions between great friends that makes this a wonderful book.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I listen to these cds in my car.  I am amazed at the quality of the vocals, particularly Anne Hathaway.  She won the Oscar for \\"I Have a Dream\\".  There are a couple of scenes missing, but overall the cds are terrific. The cardboard folder has scenes from the movie which a hard cover might not have.  Overall, it is a pleasure to listen (and even sing along).
B003O86FMW|4.0|As the second book in this series, it has left me in suspense and certainly wanting to move onto book #3
B003O86FMW|5.0|love this book. the whole series is great. after ever page you cant put it down, just have to keep reading. alos be a prime member and get it for free
0061537969|5.0|The perspective and insight in this book written from a dog's mind, is truly awesome. Loved the book and how it was written. There are lessons in it by realizing what a dog perceives from us humans, and I really don't think it's far off at all. Even if you aren't the biggest dog lover, this book is entertaining, and it's a truly great story.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long while.  It holds you at the edge of your seat as well as makes you think.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|I love this watch! Lots of cheery color to match any outfit, and water-resistant to boot -so wear it to the pool or beach!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The oriiginal charger I had for my kindle stopped working but since I got the new box charger it charges so fast I love it
B00322PK2G|4.0|The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the wristband is not as pliable as I would've thought it might be. Otherwise it's a great watch at a great price.
B009KHCT94|1.0|I'm a fan of cheesy horror and cheesy sci-fi.  I've watched Troma films, nothing is cheesier than those.  I could not stand Iron Sky.  I tried watching it.  I mean I really tried.  I think I got about twenty minutes into it and just had to stop.<br /><br />A movie that is heavy in satire when done correctly can be very good.  A movie that is heavy on the cheese factor can be good also.  Iron Sky is neither of these.<br /><br />The acting is atrocious.  It is terrible.  It was almost like they just picked up some actors from the local amateur theater club and cast them in the roles.  There was nothing funny about any of it.  None of the satire was even entertaining.<br /><br />Something that could have been amazing failed miserably.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and pretty easy, I would recommend it to any horse lovers looking for a good game to play.
B000JD1CEQ|5.0|Perfect Sunday afternoon movie, never mind you can figure it out it was just a good movie. I would recommend it.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I've never seen a previous James Bond movie and found this to be quite exciting and captivating.  It's def. made me a bond fan.  I believe I will be reviewing the previous films.
B00307OTDE|5.0|I am very pleased I bought this album it has the best song he performed in his 4 years of Rock Blues Pop History now that I old enough to understand his songs It is much more meaningful than just turning up your amp and blowing out the glass in your windows. (He was afraid ) Dig! &#34;tears burning me in my soul&#34;  There is a very sweet innocence that comes through many of his songs as well as so fear and pain I just love Jimi it's been 43 years since his death and His music is even stronger and better as generations to come people  will play his music it it so good its better than when you first heard it . Love you Jimi Thanks for Leaving us with your Music a gift that keeps on giving Dig! :')
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|We purchased our first Anker product based on the reviews other Amazon customers left.  We, too, find their products to be of very high quality and perform as advertised. I'm using the USB 3.0 Ethernet LAN network adapter.  It is not a sophisticated device, so there just isn't much to go on about.  It performs exactly as I expected it to.<br /><br />Like most Apple products, Anker has those intangible, subjective qualities of style and `over-builtness' that you don't need, but that make you feel better for having it.
B0030M3SBI|5.0|Dig!  This is his Best album  he was really able to be jimi I love his other albums to but this one has something the others do not if you're a true fan you understand what I am saying love and peace in Maine

B008XG1X18|5.0|I can honestly say Pinterest has changed my life in so many ways!! I has so many great ideas! I recommend this app to all the moms out there!!! Great on Kindle Fire!!
B0061PEAUY|5.0|This was a really good read.  Never suspected the ending, and it was a real surprise. Kathy did a lot of on the site research, as explained in the 'Afterword'.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|there where a few parts i wished they would have showed more of or went deeper in to the story but all in all a good movie
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|Great game. Great way to past the time. However, I decided to buy the full game to unlock the rest of the restaurants. The restaurants were unlock for the day that I brought it and the next they were locked again ( and still are). I would not recommend but the whole game if this is what it does.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|much better than i thought it would be...and my mom love it to..makes me wish i had a bear that talked to me
B00AR3WD8W|5.0|The remaster is fantastic. The difference between the warm up show and the actual show that was broadcast is mind boggling. It's great to hear things you couldn't hear before.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love the game, has many challenging levels. Is good for both children and adults and also like the different designs too.
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|A must have for any fan of horror. This is the classic. The add ons is really a plus. A must have.
B004XQYBA2|2.0|I tried to do the game but I was not very good at it.  I am sure there will be someone that will like it.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|It was a different read after having just finished book five of the Game of Thrones series, but very good. I've heard book two is even better. There wasn't a lot of action, it seemed, because of how it was a retelling of the characters life.
B000SEGEKI|4.0|It's a great book with many tips arising from the experience of the authors. I like your way of explaining vocabulary and concepts because these are the result of their work day to day in the software industry.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|A very good cd. I especially like the song, Chocolate Jesus. I'd like to hear more of Beth Hart's cds after buying this one .
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|the app does not do what they say it suppose to do. I ask for help and they ask me were did I buy the app and that it no help to solve the problem.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved the style good read nice pace very expressive characters. Like David Baldacci every time.  Nice delivery and you will enjoy.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I loved the book but I am old and can not remember just why, plus I have read so many books since,
B0064MGU98|5.0|I missed the first and most of the second season, scheduling conflicts. Now I can see it what I missed and I can't be more excited to see this wonderful show. The writing and the acting is very good. I can see why they've won so many awards.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|That was a bad movie I knew it was un rated but the previews did not show all the bad stuff the f word was really bad and the talk about sex and all I would not ever watch this movie again nor would I tell my friends about it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am absolutely in love with Pinterest and this app. I have it on my smart phone and Kindle Fire HD. I can hardly put it down! The app runs well and is easy to work with. Please don't change a thing!!! :)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|What a wonderful app!!  All of the sound choices can be set to start out very soft - but then get the job done very loudly!!  There are 25 different sounds from &#34;moonbeam&#34; to &#34;caffeinated rattlesnake&#34;.  You can choose to vibrate or snooze and the snooze can be set minute by minute from 1 to 60 minutes!  You can set the alarm to go off at different time for your weekdays - or weekend.  You can even change the colors!!  How great is all this??
B00A81NFAS|4.0|A romantic Comedy/Drama with a couple of families where more than one family member has mental health issues.  Enjoyable movie, solid 8/10. There is tons of understated very smart humor in this movie.  I think casting two of the top ten most beautiful people in Hollywood both with mental issues was a mistake, it's hard to buy what they are selling.  He is harassed into friendship by this smoking hot girl played by Lawrence, as Pat (Bradley) pines for his old fuddy duddy wife who cheated on him and continues to live with the man she cheated on Pat with, as Pat tries to make amends with his wife.  As Pat is continually bothered by smoking hot Lawrence, and he continues to push her away.  Enjoyable good movie, but again hard to buy what they were selling.<br /><br /> I thought Bradley was excellent in this movie, as were his parents who were well cast. Jennifer did just OK but wow is she hot, she was inconsistant.  Recomended.  I have yet to see Argo, but I'm assuming Argo is more oscar worthy.
B00BDSRISA|1.0|I'm not going to type a novel. I love Phoenix. Started listening to them when United came out in 2000. Great band and two great CDs before this. Seriously how can you not feel like you're sitting in a hole in the wall Chinese buffet? The synth has no pop or punch, no song is in the least bit catchy, it's just choppy synth along side boring lyrics and even worse guitar playing. Then at the end you get an hour more of crap. This will be the last time I buy a CD legally...
B0090SI4OC|5.0|This was a really well done movie with actors that could actually act. I know a lot of people will be upset about the things that were left out of the movie that were in the book butt the reality is that the book is huge and I well pleasantly surprised with how good this film was. I would definitely recommend that people go see this film. It was great and I loved it.
0061733199|4.0|A great book.  Covers many things that won't apply to me inasmuch as I've spend time in<br />Africa, and don't intend to return.  Rest of the information has been done very well. A good book to have on hand when and if the need arises.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Hi<br /> Love this game. You should play it. Good for all ages. my daughter  plays it all the time. So get it.
1401937519|5.0|If you want to feel better about illness and/or death, read this book. If you or a loved one is dealing with a serious illness or the death of a loved one, read this book.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I really love this game, especially since I can play against my Facebook friends. However, it seems that after playing it for one week, it stopped working. I couldn't log on, it kept kicking me off.  So I have to delete it from my kindle and then reload it. Please fix it. But, I am reloading it now(2nd time)
0312966199|5.0|I have read all of James' works.  When you read his works it is like you are sitting next to him.  You feel like you are experiancing ever moment.
B0044RC12A|5.0|I really love the characters ready to buy the next season. Also love that the season are inexpensive to buy
0312965788|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone.  It will be difficult to put it down once you start reading.  James Herriot's first book and when your done with it you will want to read all of his books.
B003TTK7OI|5.0|I immediately had to purchase the next season once I was done with this one. The writer always keeps me in suspense.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Fantastic book, one of the best of all time without a doubt. Alongside Tolkien as all time classic fantasy novel greatness.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|I stand with my decision from the subject line. I'm not really sure how this won so many awards. The movie was really long and really boring. It took forever to get to the part where the main character was stranded on a boat, and then once he was there, the movie just dragged and dragged. It definitely could have been shorter because there's really not much you can work with with a kid stuck on a boat for a long time. I ended up falling asleep during the movie because it was so boring to me. If you are going to watch this movie, make sure you watch it when you are not the slightest bit sleepy, or else you will probably fall asleep like I did.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I could go on forever about the perfection in the Avenged Sevenfold's 1 1/2 performance but the review is supposed to be focused on the product itself.<br /><br />DVD packaging is great.<br />Came with: Concert DVD w/ extras, Diamonds in the Rough CD (unreleased tracks and remixes), Album art.<br /><br />Video: On an average big screen, this concert looks amazing with the exception of the Main Menu which is pixel-y (forgivable). Video Editing/Direction of the concert is phenomenally entertaining, extras include roughly 20 minutes of intro videos from the rest of the tour.<br /><br />Sound: Probably best experienced with 5.1 Surround Sound system because otherwise the Lead singer's vocals tend to get  drowned out by instruments at times.<br /><br />Overall I give this product 5 stars. If you're an A7X fan, this is a must have.<br />Not having a 5.1 Surround Sound system is more the purchasers problem.<br />DVD Menu being pixel-y could also be something experienced on a Laptop/Computer only.
B005K17RU0|4.0|thought since it requires your gps that it would automatically tell you the temperature of where you are, instead it shows you your home location, you have to request where you are for it to show you
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A clear analysis of real life, marriage, parenting, family, and like most of us we cannot not see the truth before us.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read Fifty Shades Of Grey on a whim.  I had heard about the book a few times and the things I heard intrigued me.  Unfortunately the read was anything but intriguing.  An annoying woman who captivates a damaged man.  Neither seems to notice they are frowning and lip biting ad nauseam.  I wonder if I have to buy the second book to get to the fun part.<br /><br />No.  I think I'll pass.
B00BGIC4I6|4.0|Good cast, but story line was all over the place. Plus too much cursing from the oldest daughter. An ok film
B000FC146C|5.0|Colleen McCullough never disappoints.  Her portrayal of unrequited, forbidden love and ambition set against a background steeped in the constraints of the Roman Catholic church makes for a gripping account of ecclesiastical life throughout Europe and Asia as well as secular struggles in Australia in the early 20th century.
B00C9G22R2|2.0|I am seen all the IPman movies and all of them are entertaining especially IPman 1 and 2 starring Donnie Yen.  If you are looking for an action movie look elsewhere.  This one is extremely slow-pace and confusing that you want your 2hrs of life back.  The cinematography of the movie is great, but nothing new.  Looks like Matrix styling action scenes.  The plot is a total bore and honestly I never like any of Tony Leung movies.  I really want to punch him as he always look a like an annoying prick.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|love this show. It was good to catch up on some season 1 before season 3 hits this summer . Im stoked
B009AMANBA|4.0|This is one of the best movies ever. I compare it to gone with the wind. You can see why it is so talked about. A must have.
0385349947|4.0|speaks volumes for both men and women in the workplace.  This should be required reading for all people in business
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This came packaged beautifully and in perfect condition!<br /><br />In regard to the actual series, it is wonderful and I love it. I shopped around for the best price (for brand new) and this was it! I have gotten both of the seasons from Amazon.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I JUST WATCHED THIS MOVIE TODAY FROM RED BOX AND NOW IT'S ON MY WISHLIST! I LOVE IT! I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE. I STRUGGLE WITH SOME MENTAL ILLNESS AND THIS WAS PERFECT. IT WAS SO FUNNY AND SOME SAD BUT MOSTLY FUNNY AND TOUCHING. IT'S JUST AWESOME.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its a great game for kids, But somehow I am addicted to it. Great game and its fun for all ages!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|One of the best movies for the family I've watch since the classic Disney movies. Highly recommend this movie for anyone
B0013V33DG|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  Such risks, so many artistic moments.  Truly a miracle to have captured on camera.  Perfect sound quality.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I travel quite often.  This case provides the protection I was looking for without adding excessive bulK.  Highly reccommend this item.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, and well done.  I would not have thought it a good topic for my 11 year old daughter, but her SCHOOL recommended the book and she read it.  Since she read the book, I let her see the movie and she loved it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I really liked this.  Denzel is a great actor and he did a great job showing how his character slowly came to terms with reality versus his own version of what he was.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|We bought this movie and really liked the soundtrack. Was happy that it was available for purchase. Great songs, great buy!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great movie - very funny.  I ordered not knowing what to expect and it was a great choice.  I liked it so much I ordered it again to watch with a group of friends.
B00C32REYI|5.0|As a vocalist and producer I really support what JB is doing across multiple genre right now, very inspiring and fresh, honest sounds with his trademark vocals and edgy yet somber piano edits. I will be editing/covering some of this, thank you.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|I ordered this to watch with kids and it was a little on the boring side.  I generally like kids movies but I fell asleep during this one and the kids (aged 7) were distracted and lost interest during several parts of the movie.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|When this cd came out I was reading several of the reviews on Amazon and I had to agree with the negative reviews...at first.  To me music is like fine wine that takes time to age. This is one of those cds.<br /><br />I did not like it the first few times I listened to it and even put it on the shelve for a couple of weeks.  That is very difficult for me to write because I am a HUGE DM fan. Ever since the cd Some Great Reward(my personal favorite) I have bought all of their music since then.<br /><br />I started listiening to it again and fell in love with the second half of the cd. Personal favorite is Soft Touch/Raw Nerve. The worst is My Little Universe.<br /><br />There are several other songs that are very good also All Thats Mine, Soothe my Soul and Broken are also favs.<br /><br />Still I wish that they would just rock out in their next cd and go crazy.  Still a great band from the 80's til today. They are opening their US concert tour in Detroit MI and I will be there front and center.<br /><br />Great group!
B009VB97EY|3.0|I ordered this with a group of girl friends to watch for fun.  Not what I expected even though I had read the reviews.  MUCH too serious and not that fun at all.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Being a fan of Lee Child's character Jack Reacher (who, by the way, never wrote a book entitled &#34;Jack Reacher&#34;), it was a little disappointing to see someone as physically unimpressive as Tom Cruise cast for the lead role.  Reacher, for those of you who haven't read the book series, is a very imposing figure who used both his wits and over-the-top physical strength to survive and thrive as a military cop and as a civilian who just can't avoid trouble and can't resist helping people in dire need.  Cruise, on the other hand, is frankly a little delicate to be believable in the role.  The movie, overall, was pretty good as a typical action/adventure exercise and, aside from my not liking the casting, Cruise did a great job given his physical limitations.
B003GYEGNO|5.0|I read this back when it came out and decided to read again.  It is amazing how so little has changed since this was first published.  Sure - we have cell phones and the internet now but the financial system and social class system is the same.  Remarkable how so little really changes.
B00025E1UI|5.0|My suspicion is that nobody will order this without being familiar with the game and the music in it, so I am addressing this short/simple review to that demographic: you will not be disappointed.  Everything is here, and is just like you remember it from the game.  Beyond the music, which we already know to be beautifully composed and masterfully produced, the packaging for this item is really nicely done as well -- it's clear that pretty high quality materials and binding were used to put the boxed set, including both the discs and a nice booklet with screenshot prints from the game.  In short, this soundtrack is a real pleasure to own.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It's a easy read and allows you to just enjoy a love story. It's a predicable story but fun to read.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I watch Ellen almost everyday, so it was basically just her usual monologue but in book form.  It was okay reading, but not what I was expecting
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Same as the other reviews, it crashes if I want to watch my friend guess my drawing. marmalade error. I watch it on my phone, then I can draw on my kindle. please update this app!

B0065GC0BA|5.0|The story telling gripped me from page 1. Loved the characters, and felt emotionally for them in the final chapters.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I have no desire to be at the top of the corporate ladder, but for those women who are this was a great read. I appreciated the fact that she pointed out mistakes that she made along the way and the balancing act between her job and her family.  She is correct in that if your spouse is not supportive your chances of making to the top are slim to none.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Neat little game to pass the time.  Reccomend to anyone who finds game addicting and fun. Ready to show my kids.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Very good and entertaining read. Kept me thoroughly satisfied. Was expecting less so I enjoyed being surprised. All three books were great.
141659521X|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I have all of Vince Flynn's books and have loved all of them.  He has obviously done a lot of research on the background for his books.

B0094M2X6Y|5.0|Thought this movie was great. Bad title, though I'm not shure what I would have called it. I could never remember the name of it. Effects were great. I especially liked the &#34;dog&#34;

B00CE6E6B2|3.0|I really love this game... its fun and relatively easy and its free right? WRONG. For me this game would get 5 stars but they want u to buy the in game cash... its a scam... to many games are like this! They say its free and fun and it is fun but it is not free. You have to but the in game cash to pass almost everything. Fun game but its not free. If you want a FREE fun game? Try &quot;The Tribez&quot;
B006O2QNOU|5.0|As always Kevin Spacey was outstanding!  The plot is so in  tune with what has actually happened in the US economy.
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|very enjoyable, sometimes a little more true to life than was comfortable. you need to be over 40 to really understand.
B001Q1QF2O|5.0|I have given this album a few listens, and I  find it pretty hilarious. Lily isn't going to become my favorite artist, but no regrets on an album where I had only heard two songs once before.
B000GWE44U|5.0|Nothing more to be said! To bad they don't have a PG13 or TV14 rating with some parts cut for younger kids.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I could not use my Kindle without it.  Allows me to index, store and play media content from my computer easily.
B000SW2F8A|5.0|Storyline and everything is powerful.  Acting is superb.  Not to mention that this is history.  Yul Brenner did a fantastic job in first film but this one really tugs at the heartstrings.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Glu makes some of the best mobile game, with great graphics and awesome gameplay, but it's almost like your 'valley's on how far you can progress  without spending money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|REally good read.  Felt a bit like the movie starring Julia Roberts....&#34;Dying Young&#34;.  Love that too so really liked this book.
B008Y73940|3.0|Matthew is a good actor, but I've read Connelly and had pictured a somewhat different character than M.Mc. portrayed.<br />Unfortunately, I believe I have read this book and maybe somewhat of a spoiler for the movie.  Ho-hum.<br />Still, there are a lot of worse movies out there.
B00932A4XE|4.0|A few predictable scenes and storyline but relatively funny and entertaining if you are looking for light entertainment.  Large cast results in not enough time to develop all the characters.
B0076YMJI4|5.0|Very well made. I enjoyed it and would watch this again. Thank you Foo Fighters for bringing us great music.
B002PNDEXK|5.0|I've seen Jane Austen's 1970's production of Sense And Sensibility and enjoyed it. But this movie truly promotes the book on which it's based. The performances and the setting are outstanding.<br /><br />I commend Emma Thompson for how she wrote the screenplay. The humor is so delicate as it inspires laughter. Although it's not a tear-jerker for me, it very well may be for somebody else. The book's plot is so well-carried out in the movie that it uncovers the hearts of many women, who have found themselves searching for love in the modest and bashful manner which we were taught long before the boldness of this generation erupted.<br /><br />Mrs. Jennings is the funniest character in the movie. While she is as non-scandalous as the proper society required especially women to be in their time, she borders on &#34;non-scandalous&#34;. She loves gossip, and as thirteen year-old Margaret points out, &#34;She talks about things.&#34; I think almost every main character, except for snobbish Fanny and her spineless husband, is evaluated by Mrs. Jennings, who is not shy about expressing her thoughts. Loveable character.<br /><br />Another favorite of mine is Colonel Brandon. He is an ideal man (yet in disguise by a very humble nature) for any woman with a craving for true romance in her life, like Marianne.<br /><br />I never would have read the book before seeing the movie. But now... I recommend them both (and the previous movie version if available now).
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|My son is addicted to star wars and he can't get enough.  I usually quit after i can't pass a level.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|Both the Samsung Droid Charge SCH-i510 and the Apple iPhone use 2.1 amps to fully charge. The Anker 18W / 3.6A Car Charger can output enough juice to charge *one* of these devices but not both. Know that you cannot charge two full featured phones that are in heavy use at the same time on this device. However, this will do fine if one phone is idle or off while the other phone is in use. That said, I prefer my dedicated 3 amp charger for my SCH-i510 device and use this on a second power port for other devices along for the ride, charging an iPod and a digital camera with this device. This is not an all-in-one solution sadly.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I thought it was a wonderful book. Classic. I recommend it definitely. It would be great to read to your children
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  The acting was terrific,  Jennifer Lawrence is so believable in every role she has!!  She will be the next Merly Streep.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great show for the whole family we loved it. Each episode keeps you want to see the next . Its a great twist to all the story we heard growing up.
0061950726|5.0|This book combined many of my favorite fiction elements - a well-researched historical background, a spunky smart heroine, a story of immigration, and a coming of age tale. The stories of Molly, a modern day foster child, and Vivian, a senior citizen who was an orphan train rider in her childhood, intersect when Molly is sentenced to community service for stealing a copy of Jane Eyre from her local library. Vivian's story was my favorite, but I thought the two provided an interesting contrast to the way unwanted children have been dealt with in society at different times, and how people and their feelings really haven't changed much at all over the years. I couldn't put it down once I started reading, and I think Molly and Vivian will stay in my thoughts for some time now that I've finished. I would recommend Orphan Train highly to fans of historical fiction with a strong female protagonist.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just caught up on all the episodes and love the show,  Great storyline, great characters and suspenseful.  Definately gets you hooked.
B00AEFXZEO|4.0|Good to watch an oldie and remember the songs.  Easy watching and one that the whole family can enjoy over and over again.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|I love this app! The great thing about it is that you can exercise wherever you go. It has all kinds of exercises.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I DID NOT KNOW HOW DISGUSTING THIS WOULD BE; THE BOOK SHOULD BE BANNED!  I ONLY ORDERED IT OUT OF CURIOUSITY BASED ON A FRIEND'S RECOMMENDATION.  I DO NOT READ EROTIC BOOKS.  I PREFER TO READ MYSTERIES -- NOT EROTICA!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't read much, but I'm going to devour everything I can from this author.  This was fantastic.<br /> the overall creation of a fascinating post apocalyptic world, plot, character development and universal human theme.
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My kids love being about to watch the Kindle Fire & see Wreck-It Ralph was a true bonus. I think my daughter has watched it at least 6 times in 3 days.
B00BMT9SQA|5.0|Movie is simply amazing. Great story line combined with great acting. A must see for Streisand fans. I recommend to people of all ages.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Definitely check out this album--it's pleasantly weird. It takes a couple of listens to really appreciate it, but I think it's really innovative--you'd think he'd be out of ideas by now, but he still keeps finding new ways to be unique. The single isn't my favorite, but the video is awesome--so bizarre!  David Bowie continues to surprise and inspire like no one else.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|The controls take a little getting used to. Aside from that this is a pretty good game. Will recommend to others.
B001N26GFM|5.0|I'm really SHOCKED right now.  Talk about a moving film.  More like soul-crushingly moving.  You know for years, ever since grade school in fact, I've often wondered if any such communication between the German and Jewish children actually took place in secret.  I think about these kind of things all the time.  Even during important history lessons- when I was supposed to be taking notes for an upcoming test, instead I spent my time daydreaming over scenarios nearly identical to the one portrayed in the Boy In the Striped Pajamas.<br /><br />The greatest thing about being a child is that, they don't automatically hate what they don't understand.  Instead, children are, more times than not, curious and confused.  When a German kid takes a walk through the forest and finds a concentration camp victim around his age sitting alone and depressed, the two of them immediately hit off a wonderful friendship.  Curiosity gets the best of both children- the German boy doesn't understand why the Jewish boy on the other side of the electric fence can't come out to play, so initially he assumes the boy must be locked inside a playground and thinks he's lucky.  This is exactly what any child his age would think.  At least, I know *I* would have.  Children really do have more sense than adults whether intentional or not, and this movie shows a perfectly fine example.<br /><br />As a 30-year old man myself, and I honestly don't want to turn this into a debate by any means, I have a difficult time believing grown men would actually think it's right to kill a group of others based on their religion.  I realize I'm too locked into the modern world to even comprehend what really occurred back in the early 40's other than what I've seen in movies and read in history books, but... grown men (German soldiers) that believe killing other human beings is actually right, and to not even give it a second thought?  I don't get it at all.<br /><br />I will NOT spoil the ending and I really hope nobody else does either.  I don't even want to say whether it's a happy or sad ending.  Let's just say, it's totally shocking.  However, you can probably guess judging by the melodic and downbeat soundtrack that tends to focus around light orchestration and piano.<br /><br />The one thing that confused me and perhaps I missed a crucial storyline element somewhere along the way (I admit, I often have a hard time focusing on the fine details) is why the entire German family has a British accent.  I imagine the British wouldn't care for this at all (especially the elderly) since it might paint a false view of the events that really happened during World War II.  In other words, the British accents might lead the more uninformed movie watchers out there to believe it was the British responsible for the war.  They should have focused the movie on actual Germans and their accents so there's no misunderstandings whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, a war movie focusing on a child's viewpoint.  Expect more emotions and less fighting.  That makes the Boy in the Striped Pajamas highly recommendable.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Good storyline.....too much war!! I typically don't like books that are this long......but will probably read the next book so I can see how it all ends!
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I love this movie. I have ordered it for friends and always recommend it to others. Great price for the value.
0061122416|5.0|This book can be read and re-read and re-read and re-read...and with every reading you learn and gain a new perspective and idea of self awareness! Highly recommend for those looking for a great story to relate to or just drown yourself into.
B008TMA1LY|2.0|Very cute, great design and animation but it gets hard quick when you need better things and more help but it's all too expensive. Not going to buy coins for a silly app that's free. Not kid friendly due to the difficulty.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love solitaire and this game is perfect to pass the time waiting for something - grocery checker, doctor's office, waiting in car pool line, etc.  When you pause for any reason, when you come back it loads where you left off.  I would recommend this to any lover of card games.  It is easy to get involved and not to quit before it is solved!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I won't give it away, but I was VERY disappointed with how this season ended.  Very much enjoyed all 3 seasons up to the end of the final episode.  Not sure I'll even watch the next season.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It was cheap and the material is perfect and light and not bulky at all. Thank you very much, i will get a lot of use from this item
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought one to keep with my Jungle Primitive from S.O.G and now bought a second one for my other knives. It's n ot made to sharpen all knives due to different angles of sharpening but will work on most skinners, BBQ and kitchen knives.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Brand new DVD at a black market price. thanks very much. I have watched it multiple times and works like a charm.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I got this knife today and was so excited. First impression, this knife is heavy. Great for chopping and splitting wood(already did that).<br />Did the stab and pry test and not the best but still works and tip did not break or bend. And I don't think it will with normal use. Balance on the knife is alright. I love how the rubbery-plastic handle gives a good grip and feels in my hands. Not too impressed with the sheath but it still a decent sheath for the price. Over all I think that if anybody wants a fair priced survival knife then this is a knife to consider as an entry level knife.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Slow getting started. Had it not been a John Grisham I would probably not stayed with it. He always comes through. There were to many characters starting out. Once I got into the flow, I could not put it down an was up all night reading. It is a keeper. All I need to know now is, when is the next one coming out?
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in a long time. A very exciting. action-packed movie that I could watch again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I really like it very good game.<br />I really like the battle and were u ding the fights good job.<br />I do think u can make a few changes that would bee good but great job
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Sure to be a movie someday. Excellent dialogue with a good flow of storyline that weaves the suspense into an unexpected ending. I look forward to reading more from Mr Landay.
0553573403|4.0|This is not a sanitized book.  We have coarse language, incest, adultery, prostitution, rape, and assorted acts of violence committed for revenge, war, and outright cruelty.  Some may even question whether Game of Thrones actually qualifies as a fantasy since magic, mythical creatures, and non-human races like elves and giants do not feature prominently.  In fact, the book reads more like historical fiction than fantasy. However one defines this book, though, it is quite the story, full of intrigue, scheming, struggle, and impending menace.  We have characters who are honorable, despicable, sympathetic, and conniving.  The multiple plotlines twist and turn in sometimes unexpected directions, thrusting the characters into new dilemmas.<br /><br />The book is told from the point of view of seven different characters, each chapter devoted to a different person.  This allows the author to weave multiple perspectives and storylines together in a chronological manner, but also breaks the momentum of any individual plotline and arguably impedes the pace of the novel for the first 200 or so pages.  After that point, the plots thicken and become more engaging.  It's tempting to skip over chapters devoted to other characters in order to follow the actions of your favorites.  I certainly did, and it raises the question of what difference it might have made to the novel if the major plotlines had been presented separately, in their own sections.<br /><br />As is, Game of Thrones is a skillful weave of multiple and complex plots and compelling characters, all well told.  It may not be your typical fantasy, but it's a darned good read.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love this show! Amazon makes it so easy to watch it while working crazy hours on the road. I have never had problems streaming it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I've been searching an outstanding series I could sink my teeth into, a new world where I could get lost for hours. Patrick Rothfuss delivers just that. I feel fortunate to have just found this series so I don't have to wait for book 2.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|The controls are OK I am not much into driving games unless it has wings... but given the nature of this game it's OK... it's controls do not frustrate me... my inability to get the job done does... it is fun but frustrating.. I am keeping this one.
B000RUAR5G|5.0|My grandkids were over and i wanted them to see this movie. I ordered it online, hooked my laptop to the tv monitor via hdmi cord and we all watched the movie. My grandkids who are 6 and 4 loved it. It is a joy to see children laugh.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I do not always stick to reading a book series but i have read every book in this one. This book has so many wonderful characters in it and that is what i always look for in stories. What i am saying is that if a book does not have a good story to back it up - this book does - if the the characters are engaging and likable that makes everything alot better. I have many favorite characters in this book. From the main character Thorgrin and Gwendolyn, and King Macgil. This book is awesome and i could not put it down. When i was done reading i was happy to find that the other couple books in the series was already out. Morgan Rice has become one of my favorite authors and i wish this book could become a movie. Congratulations Ms. Morgan Rice.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I was not impressed with this movie. Although I am delighted the guy finally got his girl , the bear made me mad on several occasions. Youll just have to see the movie to find out. I heard this is going to be followed up by a second movie .oy vey
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Sadly, none of these experiments worked out for me. I liked the idea of the book. It's nice & fun to have a group of experiments to go through. However, she doesn't let you know what to do if the experiments do not work. I didn't read ahead while I was doing these exercises so when the I didn't receive results for the first experiment, I expected to read some sort of discussion on the next page about how the experiment went and if difficulty was encountered. I've said this before, but authors can go on and on about the virtues of doing something or trying something, but can only write a sentence or two or nothing at all about what happens when things don't go as planned.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Jessica deserved her award for her role in this movie. She worked the hardest.  The movie was good and the death of obl was not unexpected.

B008FRFN7A|1.0|This app is a great idea, if you have a HP. Otherwise a tedious process is involved to set a printer of your choice.<br />It is not a click and play but for HP only.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game has many levels, each of which gets progressively harder. It's fun, relaxing, and challenging. Only problem...it's addicting!  Can't believe it's free. It is first class, all the way.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|not even all that gory. the characters are fantastic. kerry washington could have been better. soundtrack was amazing. movie was a little long though.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Quentin Tarantino directed another gorry depiction excellent job.  Not the best acting but they got the point accross to viewers.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|funny but nothing special here. a classic mid life crisis movie. very realistic in some of the married too long conversations.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I watched it when it first showed and it still is worth watching again. I plan on watching all of the seasons again

0824835921|5.0|I have been struggling with learning Japanese Kanji for months, which is odd since I'm such a visual learner. But, now that I have this to use as a guide to break down each symbol, it's much easier to remember! There's also multiple indexes: by stroke order, primitive elements, a general index, and by key words and meanings. Overall the book covers 2200 kanji.

Will this be the end of Madiline and her family.<br /> Find out in the book of Storm with NO Warning.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|I enjoyed the history and the acting.  It was very well done.  You have to like the British accent to enjoy this film.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|What a great read nice to have a story with a difference make sure you have a hanky close buy it sure gets to the heart
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I find this game very relaxing and would recommend it to anyone to pass the time of day. great fun
B00873MSZ2|5.0|The item is just great... I would say perfect... Even when it took until the previous day of the delivery estimated date... I must say it worth it... I have inmediately asked for more movies... knowing the waiting is the hardest part.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Though the animation is awesome, the story contains a message that shows children know best and that there are not real consequences for children acting like brats.
B005R9U2L6|1.0|Beware - this film is NOT from the popular novel Beautiful Creatures, which is a well-written teen supernatural romance book.  Instead, this is a British murder movie, whose off-beat humor is more than offset by the occasional extreme brutality and misogynist viewpoints.<br /><br />Two women, both exploited and abused in different ways by their boyfriends, somehow accidentally team up and save each other from their boyfriends, killing said boyfriends in the process.  The boyfriend villains were too awful to endure,  and the women were sympathetic but it was too hard to watch their continued bad treatment by the men around them.  Instead of feeling empowered when they defended themselves, I ended up feeling sickened by not so much the actual violence killing the men, but the threatened horrific violence against the women!  I had to stop the film, and then deleted it from my account.<br /><br />To be a fan of this movie you will need a strong stomach, a thick skin about women's issues, and a high tolerance for violence.  If you can take all this, there is a decidedly masculine sense of humor built into the interactions between the various characters.  Good luck.
B00683JLXA|2.0|The screen moves to much when I try to shoot. Other than that I like the game. You could also bring the two pieces a little closer together.
0596809158|4.0|Like other books in the Cookbook series, this book provides snippets of examples that provide new insights into the depth and power of the R language.  Will be good addition to your R library that you will refer to frequently.
B0054SMIH6|2.0|The movie was made for your typical television movie. My adult daughters loved it, but I must say it  did seem to go on and on. The story reminded me of one that Matthew M. did years ago, I believe was called Mississippi Burning that was much better..So for what it's worth I am sure you will still find it entertaining :)
B00BB67UNW|4.0|This was a surprisingly good movie. Mark Wahlberg was superb in his role. I hated having to hate Russell Crowe because he is my favorite actor. He played his part with his usual excellence. This was a good mystery/thriller about corruption in the political field (imagine that). Good action but not the gory kind. The plot was intriguing. I will be watching this one again.
1455523550|1.0|That was just the sound of me tossing this in the recycling bin. Can't event bring myself to donate it. The world won't miss it and I'll have spared someone a few weeks of their life. Shallow and contrived writing--do yourself a favor and PASS. Zero stars.
B005PR422K|5.0|Most people reading this book would be coming from the direction of developing a new idea or improving their organisation.  But this books values go beyond that to helping all parts of business improve in their practices for change.  For example the section on the immune system is a great analogy for risk management and Eric Ries outlines an embedded approach to risk that CROs around the world would be proud to hear from their CEO.<br /><br />Beyond that this book also helps us all think about how we can innovate our own areas of practice from the legal profession, accounting, risk, human resources, and every other business function.  A must read for someone who just sees that they way we are working today is not working.
1932735410|3.0|If you are getting this just for the book - go fo it...if you are getting it because it comes with a CD of practice questions...move on unless you are will to pay additional money for the license key.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever.Myself it would be in the top 3 like temple run but this is the best on kindle :3
B003VANOFY|5.0|Works great, the sound quality is good (comparable to my sennehiser HD449's, but they actually handle bass better).  The cups are big enough to fit around my ears (small/medium head).  Battery lasts about as long as advertised (about 5-6 hours).<br /><br />Feels like high quality worksmanship.  The swiveling ear muffs are really nice as well.  Setup is a snap, and the modular base makes it easy to take these wherever if you are so inclined.<br /><br />Overally very very happy with this purchase.
B000002IFP|5.0|Waited to get this one and forgot about it for a few years..heard it on You Tube and ordered it. Great songs, great music as always
B003B02O14|4.0|A very fascinating story that kept my attention but the ending was a bit of a shock, otherwise i would give it five stars.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed reading about a time and a culture I have never experienced. Rural Ireland and orphanage sadness make a  combination that is hard to put down.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|FINALLY!!! Some good ol' fashioned \\"proper\\" rock and roll. Tom has spread his wings and is backed by a killer rhythm section that accentuates his creativity as a great song writer.  Writing a unique rock song ain't no easy task and Tom has really put together a collection of classics on this one. Check out the voice! He really stretched his pipes, using his middle voice much more than before. Really gives a whole new dimension to his music. Nothing pretentious, all really REALLY strong tunes. \\"In a Different Light\\" - are you kidding me??? What an awesome chorus jump - Brilliant! SINGLE! Got to say my favorite rockers so far are \\"Cold Day in Hell\\" and \\"Babylon\\". Cold Day stands up to any classic rocker I have ever heard bar none. If that ain't a single someone needs to go. All superlatives Tom.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Love The Hunger Games books! although the second book was the best, i did enjoy the end! Great read! would definitely recommend to anyone!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|[[ASIN:B001DJLCRC The first season of Breaking Bad]] saw Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a struggling high-school chemistry teacher, and his former student Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) join forces to produce and distribute methamphetamine in Albuquerque after Walt is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.  Season Two was originally broadcast on AMC in the spring of 2009, and this DVD set contains all of that season's 13 episodes as well as special features that discuss the filming and plot.<br /><br />Walt decided to become a drug dealer to ensure financial security for his family after his impending death, but he and Jesse quickly ran into much more trouble than they anticipated--when this season started, they were already responsible for a death and found themselves as a business partner with someone insane (and that's putting it mildly), and their troubles only multiply in Season Two.<br /><br />The blue-colored meth that Walt produces with his vast knowledge of chemistry begins to sell quickly on the streets of the Duke City, and both Walt and Jesse rapidly progress in street smarts, but the unintended consequences of their life of crime escalate throughout this season.  The two live a life of constant danger, do things that they likely thought they would never have to do such as launder money, must associate with many unsavory characters, and have to evade the police, including Walt's brother-in-law, DEA agent Hank Schrader (Dean Norris).<br /><br />The series portrays the tremendous psychological tension Walt suffers in attempting to live a double life and to keep his dealings secret from his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn).  The entire season, but the final episode in particular, shows the extent to which the crimes of Walt and Jesse affect not just them, but Walt's marriage, their families, Walt's old friendships, and total strangers as well.<br /><br />A recurring theme that really arrests the viewer is the sheer number of lies that Walt tells to hide his drug activities as the season progresses.<br /><br />This series is not for children--there are extremely harrowing scenes of the aftereffects of an IED explosion, of a fierce gunfight, and of graphic effects of drug use and addiction.  For those of age, though, \\"Breaking Bad\\" is an extremely rewarding series--there is great use of symbolism and the show has unexpected plot twists as well as outstanding scenes from the New Mexico desert.  Above all, it probes moral issues by negative example, offering lessons on how not to deal with adversity, fear, and uncertainty.s as the season progresses.<br /><br />This series is not for children--there are extremely harrowing scenes of the aftereffects of an IED explosion, of a fierce gunfight, and of graphic effects of drug use and addiction.

B008OOYALE|2.0|This version is missing many features of the iOS version, including portal, crafting, the golden tree, and virtue dragons.  It is annoying visiting other parks and seeing these features Aneroid users can not get.  Been this way for more than a year with no sign of it changing.<br /><br />There are a few other really annoying things about this game. First the expansion model ducks. You pay lots of money just to uncover debris that costs even more to clear. Costs are fine in the beginning, but quickly become more expensive than the actual dragon habitats.<br /><br />It is also very slow to breed dragons, with no hope to upgrade this without spending significant real money. I understand they are trying to make money, but most gold costs are so high that they are ridiculous.  The other big issue is evolution of dragons.  This must be done to get your dragons to level 4,7, and 10.  As evolving takes as long as breeding, your evolution cave is always busy getting newly hatched dragons to level 4. Which means whenever you evolve a higher level dragon, your newly hatched dragons are stuck waiting.<br /><br />Unless you want to sit and watch your farms every three minutes, the food costs and time to grow are really out messed up.<br /><br />The social features are pretty nice. It is easy to find neighbors in game and you get bonuses for visiting their parks.  No need for a Facebook account or anything like that. The storm id they use is easy to setup.<br /><br />The other problem I see is the game is very slow on my kindle as compared to an iPhone or ipad.  To me Dragonvale is a much better game in this genre.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Doing fast for  3weeks now dropped 8 lbs -- the only thing with the book was all the production before getting to the need to know exactly what to do -- menus had to be modified to work with the foods I like
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was a thoroughly engaging film. While some have complained about historical inaccuracies, this was not intended as an academic exercise. I have seen the film more than once and I appreciate more with each viewing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is to the point and she means what she says in this workout. I was sore for four days before my body began to adapt to these. You work large muscles with small ones to burn more fat this way thus speeding up the changes. Workouts are about 25 min each because of the warm up and cool down. Perfect for those with limited time to work out in a gym. Love it!!!
B0055MBQOM|5.0|I loved this product. So easy to use and since my ambient light in my room changes this is the perfect tool
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Considering that it is a free app, it is great: Easy to use and straight forward.  I do find ads aggravating, so I will most likely upgrade to the paid app.
0670026603|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  I cared about the characters.  I cried at the end.  I have gone back to re-read sections.  I have recommended this book to others.  I can't stop thinking about it.
0385349947|5.0|I'm about halfway through this book and so far, so good. It is extremely engaging and I usually have a hard time sticking with books like this. A lot of what she says rings true with me about second guessing my roles and success in the workplace.
B001GMQALY|5.0|its an old movie but a goodie.  When the world oodled over kim basinger and micky rourke looked a little better.
B000VSYDRM|4.0|I was quite intrigued with the concept of the movie and it's execution built around an industry I wouldn't have thought to be terribly interesting during that time period.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|it is sometimes hard to watch a pre-quel when you know what happens next but the Hobbit was a great story and never had you wondering if it was worth it.  Wonderful movie!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I actually love this.  It does more than just push dirt around. Go over the floor once and you are done.  It holds a charge for me to use it on my kitchen and bathroom floor serveral time before I have to charge it and it seems to charge quickly.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|So great to hear Daft Punk take a new direction without losing their essence.  Great track.  And I'm more excited than ever for the upcoming album release!
B008P9M614|5.0|I was waiting for this series to be sold in bulk. It was hard to contain myself from buying a season at a time. I figure it would be a lot cheaper if I bought it in bulk. I was right!<br /><br />I finished the last two seasons that I missed on television. It is a sub chapter that I am able to close in my life; to finish this series. I'm gonna start playing it from the begin and have it rerun until I get tired of it.<br /><br />The set came in in time and brand new. I would purchase from this vendor again if the opportunity rises.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love this CD. Had been listening to some of these songs on Pandora, was pleasintly surprised with the entire CD
B00932A4XE|3.0|It was a funny movie. It had funny parts to it, you know comedy. I want a baby right now.
B009AMANBA|3.0|However this movie does show what Lincoln went thru to pass a bill to free the slaves. It is very slow but a good history lesson.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This workout is hardcore but short so I am able to fit it in every day. Started seeing a difference in a week. She has a great personality to listen to- very encouraging, but tough.
B00AJF87QU|3.0|Stereophonics - in my opinion - is experiencing with the new breaths of having a Record Company. Yes, Stylus records is the label frontman Kelly Jones pulled together to release this record.<br /><br />Musically the album lacks of the power, sounds, textures and emotion other albums had. The band is allowing themselves to do what they want - even videos directed by the Band - experiencing with the freedom of not having a big Record Company behind their back. I mean, the song Graffiti on the train as a single?! come on! the song is redundant, slow and emotionless. Nice string arrangement but that;s it.<br /><br />I'm a Stereophonics fan since the Performance era and I've been tracking all their carreer and this is the feeling I have from this album: experimenting.<br /><br />My favorite tune is Violins and tambourines., seconf favorite, In a momment, and third, Indian Summer. Not favorite, but good enough to rip to my Ipod: Roll the Dice, Catacomb, We Share the Same sun, Been Caught cheating (listen to Kelly's voice real closely, it;s like he would ran out of breath, but it;s only his natural voice, tremendous improvement!). I totally would've discard: Graffiti on the train, No ones' perfect, Take me.<br /><br />All in all, for me i just part of the collection. for you guys new into Phonics, buy only the songs you like.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game can't wait till chapter two it's a must play for puzzle lovers, if u love must then you'll love this
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this book even thought it was rather sad....I wanted to read more and was sorry when it ended.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I place this game on Facebook, love that I can now play it any where I get a hot spot :)
B001CTDH76|5.0|My Wife and I Are addicted to this series we are now in Season-4 Who is Red John? Is is a She?
B001M0HGR2|5.0|Robert Downey as the narcissistic Tony Stark did a fantastic job portraying Iron Man in this movie. The technology and action elements of the movie were entertaining, but the movie came alive thanks to the strong characters.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|My Wife and I Are addicted to this series we are now in Season-4 Who is Red John? Is is a She?
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Cheryl Strayed' s engrossing book is so hard to put down that I missed a number of what had seemed important appointments...a class, a dentist appointment, a trip to the market, even though I knew I had nothing to make for dinner...just so I could keep reading in big, delightful gulps.  Strayed remembers her momentous hike along the PCT with an accuracy that makes you feel as if you are walking next to her, with aching feet and all!  Read it, then wait a while, and read it again.  WONDERFUL!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This is the third time we've watched the Tudors.  The vibrant detail of costume, set and depth of acting has made this series a watch again for us.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book has great detail that won't make u wanna stop. This book has adventure action and romance that i believe everyone will enjoy
B00B6DTWM2|5.0|This movie was awesome I loved it a lot it was scary when the child came out of the box and when the figure turned its head to see Ethan hawke sitting in his chair
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Was a fun read. Felt like the old Grisham. Even though our political views are similar, I enjoy his work more when they don't seem like a parable for a certain issue.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|i find jane austin's story line good but too much silly dialogue to sift thru to get her meaning. probably won't read her again
B004QBWU02|5.0|THIS FILM IS AWESOME!  I LOVE THAT IT IS BACK IN THE 60'S AND THAT IT HAD LOTS OF GOOD OLD MUSIC.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Buy this one as you can watch it over and over. Plot has lots of twists and turns.  Great action!
B00006JIA4|2.0|i DIDN'T LIKE THIS ALBUM SIMPLY BECAUSE I DON'T QUEEN THAT WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHY I ORDERED IT FOR MYSELF.
B000002GW5|4.0|Bought for one song and finally realized that the entire album was well worth the cost. Great album which made me buy the Very Best of.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Sometimes Joe's voice sounds like Jonsi. Its a pleasant nasally sound. The harmonies are pretty crazy, have a baroque or madrigal sound. Noodly guitars, and a drum kit inspired by needing to make less noise in a dorm room. Became obsessed after watching them for a while live on youtube
B00B4ENTJK|5.0|This is a sleeper hit, back in the 80's.  This show showcased the Arm wrestling world that<br />Stallone brought out to the public, also with the drama of his life in the movie.  Well done...
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like it. Kind of feels like cheating since you just tap on a card and it goes wherever there's a play. Adds are a little annoying. But overall, it's a fun game. I recommend it.
B007X10OLE|5.0|This show has some very talented vocalists. I enjoyed the music very much. Looking forward to the season 2 album.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This book is great.  The chapter where Tina Fey discusses assuming the role of Sarah Palin for SNL is priceless, as are her insights into modern womanhood. I also enjoyed the &#34;behind-the-scenes&#34; glimpse of 30 Rock.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I wanted to cry so bad. The 3rd book is really what had me crying though. I recommend this to anyone who likes science fiction even though this isn't science fiction.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Excellent book emotionally moving and informational.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about north Korea and how they treat their own people.
B000HKYN74|4.0|Generally, I dislike time travel in science fiction because the outcomes can seem very contrived as opposed to something flowing from a natural story line.  However, the introduction of the Xindi as a collective of different species and their terrorist attack on earth is one of the better story lines I've seen in televised science fiction.  There's also an episode which again brings in the Andorians, who provide another excellent addition to the evolving relationship between Archer and the Andorian commander Sran.  Archer pushes his crew and ship to the limits of endurance in a relentless push to head-off Earth's destruction by the Xindi.  I didn't get to see a lot of these episodes when they were first televised, or in re-runs since, so I've enjoyed them a lot.
0316044695|4.0|This book gives a first hand account of this mission, it talks alot about the training and the mission.  Gives alot of the background and bit into the mind of a navy seal.  I wish it talked more about what they think and what goes through there mind when they are training and on their missions. Overall, decent well written story.  Heard they are making a movie that is suppose to be released 2013
B006M9NJFG|5.0|This is a great and excellent product, just what I was expecting. It arrived earlier than planned and in perfect state, totally recommended!
0345803485|4.0|I bought it for a friend.  She was definitely turned-on by it.  For whatever reason, women seem to like this book.  Guys, but it for your chick.
0316224588|4.0|While not a standalone book, I found no problem picking up the series here (I will go back and read others) or feel that I missed out on much outside of Rebus' relation with Cafferty that was explained pretty well. The prose is excellent and witty, with a lot of good 1960's to 1980's rock-n-roll references, and gives insight about some of the political maneuverings found in that workplace as any others. The Rebus character is definitely fleshed out, and I get the sense that if ever put onto film would have to played by Michael Caine circa 1990 ha ha. Also like the way the old cop vs. new cop roles are made to join forces through the Siobhan Clarke character. A fun read, good mystery, and wildly entertaining dialogue!
B0041G683W|5.0|This performance is amazing, Alfie Boe singing &#34;Bring Him Home&#34; will bring tears to your eyes and if that doesn't do it the finale will.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Enjoyed playing this game on my vacation. The graphics were great and the game's storyline was interesting. It's a lot of fun.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|this is the best for any whovian out there.  just keep in mind, it is a toy.  its made of plastic, and doesnt have the best quality feel to it.  but lets face it, its a toy.  that being said, any doctor who fan will love this.  its fun to use on automatic doors, and to pretend to scan things.  im a mechanic and would keep this in my top pocket to see if any other doctor who fans notice.  and the blacklight works well for identifying UV dye in air conditioning systems, while feeling super cool doing it.  another thing, just glue the pen tip on.  it tends to fall off a lot, and lets face it, your not going to write with it anyway.  its a sonic screwdriver.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This was a wonderful Amazon buying experience for me. My four year old loves Star Wars, and we were trying to find the DVD's as a gift for him. This set was very low priced, and the package came next day! The shipping was super fast, and made it to our home in time for our son to receive his gift. He loves them! The dvd's are in great condition and the package looks just like new. This was a great buy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|it is awesome makes you think what if this happened what we would do cant wait till it starts again rick is great and machon is the bom
B003O86FMW|2.0|First one was good..Guess what, you cant just copy the first one and make some minor changes and think people would like it..Where is the character development ?
B0093WVND4|5.0|Roald. Dahl is one of my favourite writers. I bought this for nostalgic sake. His books for children are a pleasant read for both children and adullts alike.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|I have not seen such a good love movie in a long time that really touches the heart. This movie is by far a must see. :) Shows how even with knowing she is imperfect (health wise) he chooses to be with her, even though as time goes by her health will decline. I absolutely love this movie and it is worth seeing. :)
B0064X7FVE|4.0|works nice very easy to use mostly accurate with the weather  def will recomend it to anyone who want to kno the wather
B00BI73CVI|1.0|That was the weirdest, strangest movie I have ever seen.  They destroyed the Les Miserables story and the music.  I hate that I watsed my money on this one.  I didn't deserve a single star...
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|It's ok - its funny and my daughter likes to talk to it. But it could be better. But this is the free version.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Addictive, riveting and an extremely scary series. It is so well done and casted that you just can't stop watching episode after episode!
B0016K40KO|5.0|My husband was trying to replace his old scratched copy and this was beautiful and perfectly clear in both picture and sound.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|not as good as past books, but a good read. A fast, quick read. A good beach book for the summer
B002WV5A9G|5.0|It took me 4 years to see this movie, but it was well worth the wait.  If you love JJ Abrams, and if you loved &#34;Fringe,&#34; this is a great movie for you.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|as always, Nicholas Sparks delivers a great story!  I would defnitely recommend reading this book, especially if you are a fan of his others.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this series. It has great acting, beautiful sets and costumes. Shows a really interesting time in history. great characters.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Keira Knightley at all but she was fantastic in this movie. A great addition to any movie collection. a classic.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is a classy lady with a voice of the Angels.  She will calm all nerves and<br />bring peace and serenity to anyone.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|If you think you remember this movie, watch it again.  One should keep in touch with these movies. Just because they are older, doesn't mean the message isn't still meaningful. Worth discussing with children and those who can remember from their own experience. A must have.  Good copy.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|We have watched several series during the past years and this is the best.  The acting is excellent and believable and the stories are compelling.
B004XS97KO|5.0|I have loved the Doctor through everything and this season was no different. I think they did very well in keeping with Dr. Who and i very much injoyed all of the episodes.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Cannot use Table of Contents most of the time making it impossible to use Bibles and reference books.  And the few times it is highlighted,  the Kindle app crashes when I try to use it.  I like to use my Bible app and Commentary apps at church, but this makes it impossible.  I sent e-mail to Amazon and they suggested things to try but they did not work.<br />This needs to be fixed and soon!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was skeptical at first because it wasn't an item offered from the manufacturer. Once i used it, I fell in love with it. It's so easy to use and some people may say that the cable doesn't charge while it's in the case but my case is a poetic slim cover and the charger fits without having to take the cover off. I don't know if the charge time is actually quicker as some others may say but regardless, I still use it everyday.
0307341577|4.0|I like books with characters who don't have to be \\"likable.\\"  I also like books that create a convincing milieu and make me feel like \\"I was there.\\"  Finally, I like books that are a \\"good read\\" and keep me turning the pages.  Check, check and check.<br /><br />I think even the minor characters in this book are really well realized and the story is very compelling.  The only drawback is when the reader finally learns \\"what happened that night.\\" it's a little much...
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Lots of time I am not connected to wi-fi.<br />don't like the fact that you have to be connected to the wi-fi to play.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|There is no blue light in the middle of taking up the button it starts to work so there is some problems
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was great. It leaves you in the perfect spot just enough thrill and suspicion to keep you reading even if it's 3 AM. I can't wait to finish book 2-4 because they are so interesting
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|It is a book that just sucks you into it and anyone can relate and it is truly an amazing story
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is very well made and highly addictive! Very much worth the download.Be prepared to be lost in a world of bloody fantasy.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I didn't get in a hurry to watch this movie as i feared it would not live up to the LOTR films. My fears were totally groundless! This movie is as good, if not better, than the others. Whoever said it was slow and plodding must suffer from some sort of hyper activity disorder because it was chocked full of action. The works of Tolkien are extremely involved and, if you are a fan of his works, you not only don't mind the details in the movie, you enjoy them tremendously. I highly enjoyed the movie and am very excited to not only see the next two in the series but to purchase. The details are so amazing, you can watch these multiple times just to catch all the things you missed in previous viewings. Acting is also top notch. I also enjoyed the way this was tied into the LOTR films. Of course, this is just my opinion and everybody has their own. I paid to watch it and would pay again. Glad Amazon gave me the opportunity to watch it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is very helpful to my son who has problems learning  what different options on the calculator and what duties they perform help us great and do not have to run to the store and purchase one Thanks
B009GX7IRA|5.0|We missed last week on TV, so enjoyed watching on Amazon. Quality of viewing was excellent.  Great alternative to TV.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Loved it. A little slow at first.  But then it took off. Couldn't put it down. Definitely worth the read.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|I just started watching this show, and have made it up to season 6, almost to 7! Some shows are hard to follow if you try to make sense of it, but if you just let that go and enjoy it is great.
B00164EAC8|4.0|For someone tired of werewolves, vampires, and mummies, Godzilla is a welcome change.  Despite criticisms from purists, it is entertaining and fun too watch.  Yes, the monster is kind of weird looking, but it shouldn't take the enjoyment away from someone who would rather see imaginary monsters than the human-type monsters that are so popular today.  We have enough human monsters running around in real life.  We just have to watch the evening news to see them.<br /><br />  The blue-ray version is clear and shows a lot of detail, so enhances the enjoyment.  They seem to have left an opening for a sequel, but I'm not sure that would be a good idea.  I would hate to see this great movie turned into an endless series of desperate movies just to keep a character theme going.  Maybe one sequel would be alright, but no more after that.  But, after all these years it doesn't look like there will be one, anyway.<br /><br />  I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to see a well-done monster movie.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I loved this game - detailed and extensive, not too easy but not crushingly hard either, and I liked how the storyline was integrated into the play.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|It was good, but not great.  The big down side is Christian Bale's voice as batman.  I would also say it's one of Gary Oldman's weaker efforts, but Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were good.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|Great game that takes a long time to play, but has a hint button for when you're stuck. I wasn't charged for anything extra.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|The author wrote words that were truly touching that truly made you get her journey not only the physical aspect but the emotional journey.  She has such a poetic way with words.
B00009AQMJ|5.0|While not the very best recording of these works, it is still substantial in the interpretation of the music.  Very enjoyable listening.
034580404X|5.0|I'm not sure how to describe this book set. I loved it!! It won't be everyones cup of tea. It is very sexually explicit but there is also a good story line. I learned about several things I didn't know about....its like sex education for adults! I can't wait to see how the movie can be made for tv??
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I &#34;never&#34; read books, in my 27 years I've probably read around 10 books and I cannot drop this one, it keeps calling to me. Amazing book with great detailed characters that will both make you angry aswell as  make you laugh. You will find yourself taking sides in a very well written epic fantasy story.<br /><br />Cant wait for more.
B002QAY31Y|5.0|This is just superb. The producers have done a marvellous job of restoration. This is a must have for all history buffs since it covers all aspects of WWII. Mr. Olivier's voice over adds another dimension to the documentary that is very informative and at times spellbinding. You can purchase this with the assurance that you are getting the best.<br /><br />John Walsh
0857685848|5.0|Anybody who is in to dinosaurs will love this book.  I own about 5 dino books along this line and this is a pretty darn good one.  Sometimes it is nice to break up the monotony of scientific books with a good picture book.  This fits the bill.  Nice big pictures on nice slick paper.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It was an awesome game and like the graphics  Are amazing more better than the first temple run so like yeah thanks very much !!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|i hated this movie..it had to be one of the worse.i have ever seen. two thumbs down. i wish had that time back.
143911000X|5.0|This book was hilarious to read. I bought my husband all 4 HIMYM books for this birthday, and he enjoyed all of them.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|A very good movie touching with a good plot with very good acting. These are the kinds of movies that are good to watch on Sunday afternoon.
1439196834|5.0|I actually bought this for my husband. He was quite entertained while reading it. Let's just hope he doesn't put some Stinson moves on anyone but me ;)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The is one of the most creative books I have read in a long time.  It contains intrigue, humanity, mystical illusions, and is beautifully written.  When approaching the end of the book, I felt a sense of loss for my great escape.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was Amazing and I cannot wait to finish the series!!! The end will leave you hanging, longing to read more!!!(:
B00003CXTG|4.0|Very entertaining film, not quiet accurate historically, but made for a goof movie.  My problem was with this DVD...it skips and starts form beginning.  I ordered it from Amazon but it came from  Over stock...I really want to keep a good copy of this film...so am I stuck with what I have or what?<br /><br />Keith Lawhon
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love loved this book, and the series all together!! Sad to finish this amazing piece of work by an amazing author!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a well written story that takes the reader from one time to another without any confusion.  I felt the ending was a bit under-developed, but certainly not disappointing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book!! I could not put it down, it was so good. The love scenes are hot ;) but it the true story behind the graffics that is truly wonderful and touching!!!
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|The 7yo granddaughter loves playing this game.  I've played it a few times so I could explain it to the granddaughter, but she picked it up a whole lot faster than I did.
B008FPZQQU|5.0|Steven Wilson did an outstanding job on this DVD-Audio remastering/remixing. I like that he used the original recordings that were edited for the 1st edition released on LP way back when. Fine job, fine listening experience overall.<br /><br />Wilson also did a stellar job with Tarkus.
B00BBA6FOI|1.0|I have read good reviews and bought the book based on them. But then many rapes nd bullying caees happened in wich people used Facebook. And then it hit me: how come its major executive, an woman, does nothing about it?
B008FPZQRO|5.0|Steven Wilson did it again with an outstanding job of remixing/remastering Tarkus for DVD-Audio. A fantastic listening experience overall. I hope he does Trilogy for DVD-Audio (or SACD).<br />I hear that he's working on Passion Play by Jethro Tull. Sure hope it's true.

In his early albums, his voice was frankly not what it is today, and the use of the acoustic guitar tends to bring his strong voice to the forefront, and reinforces his amazing playing abilities.

B00B4804KS|5.0|The remake of the classic Steven Spielberg film Jurassic Park now not only 3D but also in Blu-Ray. When a group of scientist, journalists, and thriller seekers alike go on a preview tour of a unique amusement park something goes horribly wrong. The park's power grid shuts down and all control of the attractions are lost. The attractions being cloned dinosaurs. This film that almost brings dinosaurs back from extinction, is reason enough to see it again if you saw it in its original format, but accompanying this film with 3D enhancing effects makes this film a true a visual master piece. The best 3D remake I have ever seen. Now in stunning Blu-Ray quality gives this movie justice allowing the audience to view it in the manner in which it was meant to be seen. Also included are many awesome special features such as the Dinosaur Encyclopedia and Making Of. I personally love knowing more about the dinosaurs depicted in the film. Also when watching Jurassic Park the viewer envies in how much it fun would be to film with robotic dinosaurs on a tropical island, the Making Of feature allows the fan to truly understand what production was like. This film appeals to the die-hard Spielberg fans, Jurassic Park enthusiasts, and children who were not born when the film was available in theaters. This film was one of my favorite childhood movies and will always rank high on my list of greatest movies. I give Jurassic Park 3D on Blu-Ray 5/5 stars.

B00466HM28|5.0|This is a great keyboard if you want something that's small and portable. The build quality is great. The pads are a bit unresponsive but they do get better after they are used for a few weeks. The piano keys are a little small but not a problem for me (I have chubby fingers). The only problem I have is that the keys don't always translate the proper velocity, but if you're careful it's not a problem. Just know you won't be able to express dynamics very well. Overall, this is the best mini-keyboard on the market, but not as good as a full size keyboard.

1593083807|3.0|In a search for mysteries of dark, old houses with names, I recently turned to Jane Austen's first novel for publication...NORTHHANGER ABBEY...her Gothic novel.  It will be my first reading of an Austen novel.<br /><br />Jane Austen's NORTHHANGER was written when she was age 24...her first novel but published posthumously. It is the story of one Catherine Morlund, age 17, a clergyman's daughter, who has a fondness for reading Gothic novels.<br /><br />My reading copy is the Barnes & Noble Classic hardcover (2000) with introduction by John Kulka. Kulka is a bit of a mystery himself...All the internet says in the way of a biography is that he is executive editor-at-large for Harvard University Press and lives in Connecticut. One article mentions that he is on the board of the Dalkey Archive Press. And somewhere I found that Kulka introduces the publications of the annotated illustrated Austen volumes by Belknap Press...calling Austen one of world's most beloved authors. Patricia Meyer Spacks is credited with the first of the volumes...PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Ms Spacks, apparently an Austen scholar, thanks her editor John Kulka...for choosing her for this honor.<br /><br />The Kulka introduction to NORTHHANGER ABBEY is a very readable and interesting essay. Kulka gives the reader a choice of reading enjoyments. Northanger, he says, can be read as a \\"parody of popular Gothic romance novels...a comedy of manners...or a cautionary tale.\\" Since I am reading the novel as an example of a dark, old house mystery, I think it's given me a new approach for my reading: Kulka quickly promotes Austen's novel as a \\"clever rewriting of the eighteenth-century heroine-centered novel...the Gothic romance novel in particularly...\\" He adds that Austen was writing her novel in 1794 when Ann Radcliffe, the most famous female novelist of the time, published THE MYSTERIES OF UDOLPHO to enormous acclaim.<br /><br />My approach to this reading, therefore, will be to resurrect my love of gothic thrillers as a teen reader. I will follow Catherine Morland as she relates the story of a dark, old house as seen through her young eyes, which have been influenced by Radcliffe. I've already been warned in the introduction that Catherine initially looks at the Abbey as a \\"castle of horrors...and believes (or half believes) General Tilney murdered or imprisoned Henry and Eleanor's mother like some modern-day Montoni - the villain in Radcliffe's Udolpho.\\"<br /><br />Come join me!illers as a teen reader.

B003L77G6A|5.0|This is the funniest show ever! This show has been awesome since season one, but it got better with Mayim Bialik as Amy Farrah Fowler, a sort of female version of Jim Parsons' Sheldon Cooper!
B004CLYKLI|5.0|I started reading this book without any prior knowledge; the only thing I knew about it was it was memoir (my favorite). Immediately I found its extremism captivating. Although I wouldn't say I agree with everything that was said, I admire Amy for publishing the raw honesty of parenting and the intimate experiences of family. I appreciate the opportunity to understand her point of view, and believe it took great strength to publicly admit mistakes she made and things she learned.<br /><br />If you're open minded and interested in learning about an alternate perspective of American life, I highly recommend this book.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|1. Heath Ledger 2. Julia Stiles 3. Great modern twist on the classic Taming of the Shrew! 4. Funny antagonistic banter between the 2 sisters Kat(Stiles) and Bianca(Larisa Oleynik). 5. Great chemistry between Ledger and Stiles. 6. Good early performances by future stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Gabrielle Union. 7. Funny supporting performances by Daryl Mitchell, Larry Miller, David Krumholtz, and Alison Janey. 8. Funny gags like when David drives his Moped off the side of the hill and then gets up and acts like he meant to do that. 9. Andrew Keegan's performance as the narcissistic Joey. He's really good at playing a jerk. 10. The part where Kat flashes the teacher, too bad they couldn't show it! One thing I didn't like was the soundtrack. Sorry except for the beginning songs by the Barenaked Ladies and Joan Jett the rest of the soundtrack has too many chicky songs

B00AFOS6P2|1.0|Nick Cave's continued musical existence makes me embarrassed to like The Birthday Party. His bog-deep biblical sadomasochisms could only possibly resonate with level 50 dungeon masters and theater majors, and it basically sounds like an edgier, darker version of that radio adult contemporary stuff your mom probably liked in the 90s via Tom Waits at his most schmaltzy.

I have now taken to securing it to my grill with a bungee cord, which I'm sure will eventually tear the cheap plastic it is made of.

It takes time to read Infinite Jest, it's not for the faint-hearted, it is a commitment.<br /><br />The forward by Eggers is skippable.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|There's probably no such thing at all as the \\"perfect family\\". As many families go, they all have a few problems involving finances, work, and relationships between each other. But despite their problems, they know that there is always someone there who will be there for them. For one particular family, their trip to a child beauty pageant will take them through many shocking moments that makes this film more drama than just humor.<br /><br />The film follows the fractured lives of the Hoover family and what they're enduring. There's Richard (Greg Kinnear), who has invested his money in his own motivational program that's going nowhere. His wife Cheryl (Toni Collette) is the one who tries to keep her family in a peacefully calm state. Frank (Steve Carell), Cheryl's brother, is in a state of disillusion after losing his lover and is now living with her family after a failed suicide attempt. Grandpa Edwin Hoover (Alan Arkin) just got kicked out of his retirement home after doing cocaine and now living with the family. There are two children in the family as well. Dwayne (Paul Dano) in the teenager who has a pleasure in reading Nietzsche and is taking a vow of silence until he can go to flight school. Olive (Abigail Breslin) is the perky adorable little daughter of Richard and Cheryl, who's usually unaware of her family's problems, dreams of being a beauty pageant queen.<br /><br />While the whole family tries to have a nice quiet dinner, they get a message on their answering machine that Olive has been given the chance to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in Redondo Beach, California. So the Hoovers are now heading there in their yellow VW bus, with a storm of tension brewing along the way. After having a bite to eat at a diner, their bus breaks down but gets fixed up and they all have to push it together to get it started. Later, each of the family have unexpected moments of shock and emotion. But one tragedy during their trip might bring it all downhill in an instant.<br /><br />\\"LIttle Miss Sunshine\\" is absolutely marvelous, from the opening scene to the ending. The story has a truly realistic take on a dysfunctional family that makes it feel so real. The whole main cast all fit perfectly in their roles with a lot of humor, drama, and spirit. The music in the film is just so somber and blending. The camerawork even makes you feel like you're actually with the Hoovers wherever they go. \\"LMS\\" is truly one of the best indie films of all time, as well as one of my all-time favorite films.<br /><br />It's a movie that will put people in a laughter, shock, and enjoyment with its realistic tone. Others will probably find it a bit strange and unreal. But the the point of the film is that \\"no one gets left behind\\" in the family. The film even had me thinking that we're all very lucky to have our loved ones with us when we need them the most. \\"LMS\\" has an ingredient that helps it become so incredible: family.<br /><br />Final Verdict: \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\" takes a realistic and unforgettable idea about a family and their adventures on the road.an instant.<br /><br />\\"LIttle Miss Sunshine\\" is absolutely marvelous, from the opening scene to the ending.

0071359168|5.0|Positioning is part of the evolution in concepts used by Advertising and Marketing. Some authors and practitioners like Claude Hopkins, Rosser Reeves, David Ogilvy have made fundamental contributions to the development of Advertising. I have an impression that Positioning is also the latest great contribution in the history of Advertising.<br />After this book, marketing authors have rediscovered old concepts with other words again and again... (If someone identifies a new fundamental concept introduced later please post your comment on this review!).<br /><br />This book is a must read, for the ideas in it and the pleasure to read it.<br /><br />The importance of \\"Positioning\\" had a great example just recently in American Business history.<br />Steve Jobs was a master of positioning, he did it to Apple and Pixar in a spectacular way. Each new product he unveiled to the public he would position it in a very particular way creating a marketing impact second to none.<br /><br />What is most strange is that, the Authors of Positioning kept repeating themselves in several books, committing the same sin that they criticized on others, line extension!

But now I feel the need.  After reading ONE book of his, I am ready to proclaim Matthew Quick the dark side force of Nick Hornby.  Or maybe the light side?  Or maybe the American version there of?  (don't even know if he's American) If you enjoy Nick Hornby......then this book is a must read.  I'm having a hard time typing all of this because I just can't stop thinking about this book.  Stupid review and not helpful, I know.  But I am very picky about my fiction reading (I prefer medieval history and Oliver Sacks type books)......and I bought this because it was on sale.  Wow.  I will be buying more of Quick's books.

055358202X|2.0|Wordy but well written.  Separating the two books is very irritating and the new paperback is ridiculously expensive if you are at all interested in spending the money for a book that isn't even a sequel.  If the two had been released together may have been worth it.<br /><br />I started the series in 2000 and can't believe it isn't finished yet and only has four books to this point.  If he focused on his writing instead of Hollywood the series would be much better served in my opinion.

I slap this video in and crank up the volume while doing stuff around the house.  Chores never went so fast.  Although the band is without Don Felder trust me, you won't miss him.
0399157565|2.0|I like Patricia Cornwall novels.  I am disappointed in AMAZON for misleading me regarding the pop-up ad which led me to believe this was a &#34;NEW NOVEL&#34;.  Instead, (while I have not read this one) I find this is a back release as it takes place in Boston and Benton is alive?  Her latest books depict Scarpetta in Charleston, with Benton dead and Marino retired??  In the future, I will have to &#34;look inside&#34; to ensure this is not a re-release of a series!
B000059QYB|5.0|I have played this to death, if your an Idol fan, you can not go wrong,<br />Idol can rock with the best, good selection of songs , one I my favorite CDs
B0052AC8C6|2.0|I usually enjoy the movies like this but I couldn't even get half way thru this one. I'm a big kid at heart but this &#34;cartoon&#34; just didn't hold my attention. It's visually nice, colors as well as sound but the content of the movie just didn't grab me.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|Based on a real-life case involving a New York real estate family, ALL GOOD THINGS centers on the life of David Marks (Ryan Gosling), who has been permanently psychologically scarred by the sight of the death of his mother at seven years old.  He meets and marries beautiful blonde Katie McCarthy (Kirsten Dunst), and the two of them settle down to a life running a health food store in Vermont.  Soon Digby is recalled by his dominant father (Frank Langella) into the family 'business,' which involves a multitude of shady deals.  David returns to New York, and his true nature emerges.  Told over a period of thirty years, ALL GOOD THINGS boasts a strong central performance from Gosling as David, with good support from the other two principals.  Yet its narrative is sluggish, to say the least; there are too many dissolves from one sequence to another, accompanied by the kind of idyllic music and photography that looks and sounds good but holds up the development of the plot.  The d&eacute;cor is stunning; but the story has a rather insubstantial feel about it.
B007QDNKQA|3.0|This movie is worth watching if your a mark wahlberg fan and are looking for a decent movie to watch. Not great, not awful
B005R7DAWG|4.0|This classic book is long and it is clear that it was published in parts. It is not a swash buckling romp like The Three Musketeers.<br /><br />It is episodic, particularly in the earlier chapters. All these episodes could stand alone but they are relevant to the plot and the significance of each is revealed later in the book.<br /><br />Monte Cristo remains enigmatic to the end and is more like an avenging super hero than a true character. Whilst it is a book of revenge, the hero finds other things that the villains have done to use against them, rather than what they did to him.<br /><br />Reading in French, the many spacing errors are more than a distraction. Words run together and it takes a little time to sort out what words like `ladélicatesse' mean.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book in the series was as hard to put down as the first one. Story is well told and you just can't wait to find out what happens next.
B00A6I87UQ|2.0|The Kindle version of the Sky and Telescope Pocket Sky Atlas is very difficult to read.  Everything (text and sky maps) are so tiny on the Kindle screen. The formatting is terrible.  It needs to go back to the drawing (formatting) board. Too bad that it couldn't be viewed before I purchased it.

0345803485|5.0|I have to admit before continuing my review, that I steered clear of this book (the whole trilogy actually) for a very long time. The reviews that I've read about this book makes it sound like well...literary porn, which isn't the kind of book that I want to read. Yet, my curiosity got the best of me as I kept seeing this book everywhere and it is in the process of being made into a movie.<br /><br />Let's just say, I am so HOOKED ON this trilogy. I know that these books were based off Twilight (which I also loved), but I have to admit that I like 50 Shades so much more. Ana is such a relatable, and fun character. She stands up to Christian, and isn't afraid to speak her mind. She is also very witty and sarcastic, and a lot of the thing she thinks in her head or says out loud makes me laugh. She has a great sense of humor, and although she falls for Christian, she makes sure to stand her ground. She's a strong female protagonist, which I admire.<br /><br />Christian Grey is also interesting because he is very layered. He is: tough, angry, sweet, sarcastic, controlling, tender, kind...you see how these traits contrast one another greatly? That's what makes him so compelling. Like Ana, he also has quite the personality and isn't afraid to show it.<br /><br />These two characters are very stubborn (as in they do what they want, when they want, and don't care what other people think/say) yet, they would do anything to make the other happy-also very contrasting-and you can see why their relationship isn't easy at all.<br /><br />Christian and Ana compliment and compel each other at the same time, and it is that tug and pull effect that makes the story line so entertaining. I also like learning about why Christian is the way that he is, and when you find out his secrets you will care about him as much as Ana does.<br /><br />So put those judgmental looks away, and give this book a chance. Mrs. James, you have just earned yourself another fan. Can't wait for your next piece of work.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|For those in love with the first one... The remake pales in comparison. It's not bad, just not the same as the old cast.
0439023483|5.0|Let's be real, who really wants to read a story about children duking it out to the death? Not me-the thought actually freaks me out, and at the same time saddens me. Children are so innocent and kind, that the idea of giving them weapons to kill while adults watched and cheered them on, gives me the chills. The book is gory, much more so than the movies as the author does not sugar coat any form of pain. But aside from the violence, it is the history behind this dystopia that really drew me in. How does a society get to be so messed up? How does power get to be divided so unevenly?<br /><br />Katniss isn't your typical character as in she is hard to like at first. She is cold, and not very relatable but she is also very strong. She will do anything to protect her little sister, and avoids any feelings necessary because in her world, loving someone only puts you in danger.<br /><br />The whole process of the hunger games from preparing for it, to actually being in the arena is so mind blowing. There were so many moments where I asked myself: What would I do if I was in that situation? Could I have overcome that?<br /><br />The violence was hard for me to take, but it seems to be a reoccurring theme throughout the trilogy. Not the kind of violence we see in racing movies or anything like that, but real human suffering. Some parts were hard to read, hard to take in, but I couldn't put down this book.<br /><br />The world that Katniss lives in, is so different from ours. We may complain about problems here and there, but seeing what the people of the future-so to speak-had to go though, I appreciate that I could close the book and go back to my safe little bubble.<br /><br />This book will take you out of your comfort zone for sure, but at the same time, it makes you not want to go back to that zone for a long time.

B00AE2J5HI|5.0|I liked this movie very much.  The acting and story line were right on target.  I thought Tom Hardy and Shia  LaBeouf did a fantastic job in their roles as brothers.  Very well written, my rating is 5 stars.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I really loved this series. I liked the all of the characters and thought the story was unique. Can't wait to for TV show!
B00BESNKB8|2.0|I  viewed this movie because my 17 year old nephew wanted to see it.  I did not find the movie to be entertaining.  I think my age has a lot to do with it.  I was a teenager when Bruce Lee made, &#34;Enter the Dragon&#34;, meaning I have seen many movies similar to this one.  The special effects were over the top meaning it felt like a &#34;B&#34; movie.  I gave this movie a 2 star rating.  My nephew said the movie was great and he liked it very much.
B008602KQI|4.0|I have the cheapest Internet connection that my cable company offers, so I wasn't expecting to even be able to watch a movie online.  There was no delay at all & no buffering!  Wahoo!  The video quality wasn't as clear as DVD quality, but I can't say I care.  :)
B00BHMF578|4.0|I thought this movie was well done as was the acting.  The movie seemed to be a very accurate depiction of the true events.  The movie moved a little slow for me as I do remember the incident when it occurred.  I liked the movie and gave it a 4 star rating.
B00881PTRC|4.0|I very much enjoyed this little game. The animations of the hangman character were funny and continue to be funny even after seeing them a few times. Certainly can be difficult when, for instance, the word you are guessing ends up being some odd foreign bird that you never knew existed or could ever spell. Well worth the small price
B008OE05IG|5.0|An inspiration to turn the monotony of work into a beautiful life of passion. A must see for those working in the hospitality/food industry. A story about the pursuit of perfection with the understanding that it will always be slightly out of your grasp.
B0087EACJK|3.0|sliding cards around to move levels is a neat gameplay mechanic, but not new. Overall i've only fired up the game a few times to remember why I don't play it. The 'cards' don't lock into place very easily and typically i become frustrated when moving a card and not being able to jump back into it because i was 2 pixels short of it locking into place. Secondly, jumping and moving are flighty. I would try to jump and end up walking into a pit. What, did I not swipe 'upwards' enough to trigger a jump instead of walk?<br /><br />There are probably more gameplay mechanics as the game progresses, but I doubt I will ever see them.
B00B8WXFWE|4.0|It is just what I expected from one of my favorite bands and just a bit of new flavor to keep it interesting.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|We'll see how long the ceramic and carbide pieces last. I think they are reversible as well. I use it with one hand. I hold the knife by the handle in between my legs (knees) and pass the pp1 over it. I've never used a sharpener before and wow. I can tell the difference. Pretty amazing.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This story is about (in my opinion) a very extraordinary man.  After watching this dvd  I asked myself How on earth did he survive the terrible nightmares and sufferings he and his family and friends went through. My heart was in my mouth constantly but I just couldn't switch off . This story is about death,courage, friendship, pain and suffering and hope. You will find yourself walking each step with these good people, you may even find yourself crying out &#34;hide&#34; at some point in this story but once you have seen this movie you will never forget it.

B00BSBY38A|5.0|I had a hard time telling the difference between the computer animation and real animals.  The story line was also really good considering it was about a boy on a boat with a tiger (sounded kind of boring at first).  My kids also really enjoyed it.
0316228532|4.0|Any reader who buys this book in the hope that it will be Harry Potter for grown-ups is in for a disappointment. Turning her back on the realms of magical possibilities JK Rowling sets out to prove that she can write about the actual world in all its gritty authenticity. Pagford is about as far from Hogwarts as it is possible to get; Rowling wastes no opportunity to describe all that is seamy about provincial life with its petty politics and parochialism, crime and grime; the mundane and the inane of small-town England. From a protracted flight of inspired fancy her imagination has plummeted to the slimy underbelly of life.<br />Her characters are uber earth-bound, over- burdened by neuroses, guilty secrets and personal agendas; they are multi-flawed rather than multi-faceted; the human palette is less of light and shade than of shade and gloom, but it is not the less interesting for that. I found myself drawn into their stories much as one is drawn into one of the seedier soap operas, with a slightly ghoulish fascination for dinge and sleaze, of which the Pagford residents abound; A Casual Vacancy became a guilty pleasure.<br />Rowling clearly draws on her experiences as a social worker to produce her characters, some of which are unnervingly vivid; Simon, for example, the mechanics of whose control over his family through fear and violence were especially well rendered. On the other hand I found Bridie, a resident of the Fields social housing estate, to be a grotesque caricature, one-dimensional and unconvincing. As a single parent, an addict and a prostitute she might have provoked a great deal of sympathy had these aspects been under-girded by an attempt at a complex, humanising psychology. But Bridie was debased by the writer, weighed down by a Neanderthal ignorance, an utter dearth of mothering instinct and no vestige of self-respect or even self-justification. Appalling personal hygiene heaped humiliation on to insult. She was, sadly, a brutish figure rather than a tragic one.<br />Interestingly it was the teenage characters which engaged me the most. Fats is a monster but given his parenting I could completely believe why. Krystal is like a cheap chocolate truffle; hard on the outside, soft on the inside but too tainted by the additives of her circumstances to be palatable. Arf appealed to me most of all, the only character I found genuinely sympathetic. I couldn't help but speculate whether the teenagers' furtive sexual couplings and voracious consumption of internet porn hadn't formed some flip-side back-story for Harry, Ron and Hermione in the author's mind! Rowling clearly knows and understands the young person's psyche. I wonder if that isn't what she should stick with, in future.<br />In the end the characters' relentless unpleasantness and unremitting angst did begin to feel oppressive. Oh! For someone to do something kind! For someone - anyone - to be happy! But it seemed that, in Pagford, it was too much to ask. The only kind, happy character, Barry Fairbrother, meets his demise in chapter one. His absence, both in the book and on the town council, is the vortex around which events and the hapless Pagford residents revolve. As such, I expected the election, to which the characters' political manoeuvrings all move, to be a dramatic climax, both an eruption and a resolution of the myriad issues. In fact it was something of a damp squib. The dramatic denouement comes from another, much more unexpected source.<br />Rowling's dialogue proliferates with the F word, which some readers might find offensive. I found it pointless and rather juvenile. If it was an attempt to be `grown up' it failed. Her prose, on the other hand, is sharp and crisp, sometimes acerbic. Her gimlet eye for people's flaws is pitiless.<br />As character-led fiction, with a lovely unity of setting, A Casual Vacancy works well . If that's what you like (and I do), you'll enjoy it. You'll also enjoy this:[[ASIN:1479379425 Lost Boys]]than a tragic one.<br />Interestingly it was the teenage characters which engaged me the most.

0812983459|4.0|Harold receives a letter one morning and his walk to post his reply takes him four hundred miles, on foot, from Kingsbridge to Berwick-Upon-Tweed.<br />En route, with help from various passers-by, he addresses his past and the dull vacuum which his present has become; the enormous twenty year gulf which has separated him from his wife; the ways in which he was failed by his parents and went on, in his turn, to fail as a parent; his tentative but unimpeachably proper relationship with Queenie, the work colleague whose letter has lit a dormant spark in Harold's consciousness.<br />Harold himself is a tour de force; endearing, naive, courageous, diffident. He is a man galvanised by his mission, but a pilgrim whose epic calling is touchingly hampered by inappropriate footwear and the lack of a map. The sheer physical slog of Harold's journey is never romanticised and the reader becomes as intimate with his chiropody as we do with his psychology. The practicalities of the journey are perfectly balanced against the challenges of Harold's inner expedition; blisters, bruises and the difficulties of laundering shirts and socks in a B & B bedroom basin are beautifully juxtaposed with Harold's metaphysical meanderings on questions of faith, loyalty and friendship.<br />Likewise, the geographical details of his travels - landmarks, road numbers, the changing landscape and the progress of the seasons - all form a reliably solid framework for his interior voyage. The reader is never lost in Harold's musings because the route to Berwick is so trackably solid beneath our feet. The people he encounters on his journey all have something useful to offer, to Harold - cake, counsel, sticking plasters, personal experience - and to the reader - variation in voice, anchors in place and corporeality; they counter-balance the ghosts in Harold's head. They are brief but perfect vignettes which inspire him on.<br />Meanwhile Maureen, Harold's embittered wife, the bane of his life, is left behind in the net-curtained bungalow to experience what life without Harold would be like. She too, although rooted to the spot, undergoes a journey to self-knowledge quite as arduous and painful as Harold's. The question is: will they, at the conclusion of their travels, end up in the same place?<br />When I picked this book up I admit to a groan: `Not another book about an old man on a long walk,' I thought, having recently been wooed and then woefully disappointed by The Hundred year Old Man Who Climbed Out of a Window and Disappeared. But this is the book which that one should have been. A tender but incisive retrospective, a bruising self-discovery, a beautiful placing of everything into its proper perspective. Here we have the smallness of man perfectly balanced against the vastness of the landscape, the lucidity of vision, both terrifying and purifying, which age can throw on time, and the healing power of honesty all set amongst the hedgerows and B roads of an English spring.nd in the net-curtained bungalow to experience what life without Harold would be like.

B0096CDG0O|1.0|At first this game worked great and was a lot of fun. Then they updated it. Now I can't get any notifications for games. I emailed customer service TWICE with no response. One person told me to uninstall and reinstall, and after I told them I already did that four times, they ignored me.<br /><br />Even if the game will work I wouldn't support this company. All they care about is money. Once you pay you don't matter to them anymore.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Yes, the shaky cam is a bit annoying, but to keep it w/in the PG range it had to be that way. The actors were all amazing! Jennifer Lawrence is the perfect Katniss even if she is taller than the character. Peeta was rigt on target all around and couldn't have been more accurately cast! Can't wait for Catching Fire!!
B004TI5N38|4.0|Interesting read from one of my favorite authors.  Not one of my favorites from Baldacci, but it was worth reading.  I was disappointed in one of the deaths in the story, but overall, good storyline.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|This little tripod is almost too little - another two inches in height would make it more functional.  The main drawback to it to me is that the place where the iPhone attached is very tight, so tight that I was afraid my phone would shoot out of my hand before I could be the top bracket over it.  I've tried to stretch it, but it's still difficult to get my iPhone in the bracket.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|This app is true rubbish. I have never played Minecraft before, and thought this was similar.  In the first thirty seconds, I was killed.... BY A COW!!! Very bad things were going through my mind. I told a friend about it, and it turns out that this is NOT Minecraft AT ALL. If you are looking for an app similar to Minecraft, look at Minecraft : Pocket Version. This app will dissapoint you majorly.

0446693804|3.0|I just got done with finals and was looking forward to really getting into an easy read. I dove into this novel hoping for a sappy love story that I could get lost in, but was disappointed when I got halfway through the novel and found it going nowhere. There is very little character development, and so far I'm having trouble finding any depth or like ability within the characters. So far, it is just kind of a boring narration of this kid who gets roped into doing good deeds, with a girl who he begins to respect.<br /><br />I already know the twist and am still waiting for a climax or pivotal point in the novel.<br /><br />I will undoubtedly pick it back up again, and be able to give a more complete review. But for now, I'm putting it down and grabbing a Harry Potter.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Interesting I couldn't put it down!! My stepson was reading it and I started it after reading with him and then I finished it on the plane!! Really really good!!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I pre-ordered this movie and was super impressed when the price actually was lowered automatically by Amazon when it was sent out. I really enjoyed this movie and would have given it 5 stars, however it was a bit too long for me and some of the casting I wasn't crazy about.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great story, wonderful characters! Look forward to the new movies too! Wish there was more coming and think suzanne collins is great!
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Pretty much everyone has commented on how this film doesn't follow the book and the how casting Tom Cruise in the part was an injustice ad nauseum. Yeah, yeah, ok. Even though Cruise is nearly a foot shorter in real life than Reacher is described in the books, it is some of Reacher's attitude and intensity that Cruise brings to film and makes for an entertaining movie. Cruise stretches his typical character where he is a supra-capable but reluctant do-gooder who uses humor in stressful situations by adding a much darker side and less forgiving quality to the protagonist. Don't watch the movie to learn all about Reacher, you'll need to read the books for that. Watch it for the pure entertaining value and to see Cruise in a somewhat different role.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I like the game because it was mysterious and it was like a story telling. I also like looking for the hidden object and the clues.

B00AMSLRAC|4.0|Good game daughter loves it!  Keeps her entertained and it lets her know that she is doing a good job at gardening.
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Shawn takes a very different approach to the world of psychology that makes so much sense. After the first chapter it's hard not to easily identify with what he's talking about. It really is common sense, we need more books and studies released on positive psychology.

I was a little apprehensive at first to purchase this organizer (thinking the organizer would be too big for the umbrella stroller), but this product fits perfectly on the umbrella stroller and holds all the sippy cups (even my drink cup) well.  It feels sturdy and detaches easily when I fold down the stroller.  Well worth the $9 paid.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie poorly explained things or didn't explain what they were at all. Granted, it was good entertainment, but kids killing each other removes an aspect of whatever humanity they had at the very start.
1601251505|5.0|if you are looking to get into DMD this is a phenomenal place to start. this book functions as the player handbook AND dmg module AND magic loot table, a MASSIVE value compaired to the two book split the dnd 3.5 books force on you.
B00ADQ7JCS|2.0|All I can say is that Lifesigns must have lots of family members reviewing this.<br />I bought this on the strength of the track on a Prog Freebie CD. I was well suckered by that, as it was the only good track on the album. The rest is like some foul Nik Kershaw does Prog-lite filth.<br /><br />Avoid.
111846446X|5.0|pretty much gets you going on whatever you were intending to use the PI for, decent price, written for a layman like myself.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|After having watched this rather up-lifting movie on TV several times I decided I needed it in my collection.  No robots, no murders, no battles, no guns ...... just a straight forward entertaining movie. .
B004LWZW42|5.0|Probably not the last of the X-MEN series, but this was a great pre-quil. It's great to see the first aliance amoung the muntants, even if they didn't last.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I'm very pleased with my new case for my Kindle Fire HD!!! It's very stylish and provides good protection for the kindle..
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that you can set it to play your music along with what's the loudest it can get. I fully enjoy. and appreciate. this app.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book opened my eyes. Life is not guaranteed. You must live life to the fullest. A true love story. Pure beauty.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I liked this book but it wasn't wonderful.  I guess I would have liked more closure and happy ending to it
B0072V394E|2.0|The reviews indicated this movie was wild and really entertaining, but it was slow and unusual at best. It was no Clint Eastwood.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I haven't tried all the Android alarm clocks, but this one works great for me. Tons of features and easy to use.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book buy it at first I didn't like it but I gave it a chance it's just great and good
B0035O66CO|5.0|There is nothing I wish to say in the negative about this film story. As many times as I have viewed it over the years it has remained as charming and delightful as the first time.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Want to meet a family obsessed? Welcome to Pat's family. Pat played by Bradley Cooper has signed himself out of a Baltimore Mental Facility, his mother, Delores, played by JackiWeaver, picks him up. Another patient wants a ride home, but Delores finds out he is not released. Home they go to Pat, Sr played by Robert  DeNiro. This may be Deniro's best role in awhile. He plays an obsessed Philly Eagles fan, he bets money and runs an illegal game. He can't go to the stadium because he was kicked out for fighting. Pat, Jr 's goal is to get back with his wife. He caused some violence in their marriage and went for therapy in Baltimore in lieu of jail. He has been diagnosed as Bi-polar. The family obsessed!<br /><br />That is the intro, into the mix comes Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawerence, a young widow who has played around a lot. She has a goal to enter a dance contest and needs a partner, enter, Pat Jr. A rollicking funny, fast , sad time ensues, and we meet more family and friends. This is a love story and a story about people with problems who try to find their way.<br /><br />Deniro's deserved an Oscar or his role. I loved his character. JackiWeaver, Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence were all terrific. A terrific film. I urge everyone to see it.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 04-30-13
B005COO1X6|5.0|I am always amazed at the ability of some people to tell a great story in so few words.  This is a classic Stephen King Tale told in short story form.  The only writer that could even touch this would be Ray Bradburry!  Buy it!  Enjoy!
0312330537|4.0|This was a story about redemption and awareness, themes that get lost in the shorter novels that are so prevalent these days. I fell in love with the characters the culture the exotic locations and the incredible journey of the complex protagonist in this richly textured epic. Looking back, I feel like this could have been stretched into 3 or 4 novels because of the different stages of the protagonists trek but am altogether happy he kept it as i read it. The writing can be flowery at times, but immersed in the gamut of emotions this story draws, I seldom noticed. I am someone who reads everyday and once I finished this work of art it was hard for me to read anything that seemed worthy of my time.
0978545095|5.0|If you are reading this you probably know something about the Vivian Maier Story.  This is a great representation of her work.  I enjoyed it VERY much and was incredibly envious.  Being a long time photographer I kept seeing images in the book that had me saying &#34;I wish I had shot that!&#34;
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I think this is one of the most intriguing games I have ever played. I can't wait for the next room to be released.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Lots of action and gut wrenching violence. Very gritty with a great story line. Cast of characters is outstanding. Looking forward to season two!
B004H1V5RU|4.0|My three grandsons enjoy puzzles like this. It made for an OK birthday present. They said they enjoyed it anyway at least.
B0026KZ3T0|5.0|This movie is great for teenagers, women and men as well.  It is a laugh at loud, romantic comedy that anybody who has been in a dating situation can relate to.  Will Smith delivers in another great movie, and Eva Mendes is surprisingly a good actress as well as  amazingly beautiful.  This is definitely a &#34;yes&#34; movie!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|Awesome game,very easy to master and it gets challenging as you go farther.I recommended this game if you like killing zombies.And you can play multiplayer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Okay ladies.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  This is an amazing read!  very HOT and STEAMY!  One of those books that you wish you were the main character!
B007WFTFG6|5.0|My 3 year old grandson loves to use my Kindle Fire.  Gee, guess I will have to get me a HD or get him one.  He loves it!!!  Then my granddaughter will want one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is such an amazing read!  I am so excited for the third in the series!  I highly recommend  this book!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|One of the best Grisham works yet. As a criminal lawyer myself, he is dead on describing the events in this novel.<br />His ending is terrific.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|keeps my grandson entertained while we are on the road.  It is a great babysitter for the car!  as long as you keep the sound down that is
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|If you loved the electronic remixes of some of Tegan and Sara's music, you'll probably love this album. It's more pop influenced than any of their other albums. It's fun and for once all the songs aren't about heartbreak, which was a little odd for me to hear after being a fan of 9 years. I listened to the lyrics and I was kind of like &#34;wait...you're happy for once? That's new&#34;. When I heard Closer, I was so excited. I played it on repeat until the album came out. It's such a &#34;sing along into a hairbrush while jumping on your bed&#34; song for me. It makes any day automatically better. I love the album and I'm excited for what they'll come up with next.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book kept me reading. I could not put it down.  Was so excited to start the second in the series!
B00821BLX4|5.0|If you own either the TG-1 or TG-2, then you really need this adapter.  If for nothing else, the ability to add a UV filter to protect the lens.  Comes with a lens cap, so don't order another!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put it down.  It was one of those books you just had to read another chapter before you could put it down!
B000AM2L1O|4.0|just right for an almost 2 year old who is going to be having a new baby in the house.  looks well-made. not a scary looking doll (my husband thinks many life-like dolls are creepy).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|WOW!~  I was sad that the series ended!  It would have been great to keep it going..... I sure would have kept reading
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is a very user friendly app.  I like the way you can pinch the screen in portrait or landscape mode to fit the screen.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played it and played it and it is so easy and you don't have too much thinking and strategizing to do.
B000OLX4SU|3.0|Good movie, even better cast! I could hardly recognize Dinero! The movie is pretty close to the book. You'll enjoy it!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|My husband and I are getting ready for the Red 2 coming out this summer by doing a revisit... Great flick the first time, great flick the second time!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|If you're looking for a book that's scary and has a well written deception of the events this is the book for yoooou
B0001CCY7E|5.0|This fantastic soundtrack of Dances With Wolves is great for road trips out in the country. It puts you out there.
B00C32REYI|5.0|If you loved the first album this one steps it up just a bit.  More dancy electronic drops however not losing the soul and depth to JB's music.  Also more experimental, so give the album a few whirls in your headset before judging.  Saw JB at FYF festival in LA last year, and without favoritism I think most would agree he blew away all the 'more popular' electronic artists.
B000SP1SEO|5.0|BEST....MOVIE.....EVER! i can't wait til my son gets older so we can watch it together! Never underestimate those that seem less fortunate than you, this is living proof! Brad Pitt is  a bad dude!
B005SMUW8U|5.0|I am bias, I admit.  I love Tom Waits and don't even know the guy.  His music is among my favorites, it is rough, fresh, sometimes frustrating, and always a new experience well worth the time it takes my brain to absorb it all.  This album really combines Toms creativity, past styles, and of course creating new sounds and styles for musicians to copy for another 100 years.  I would rate this album &#34;Classic&#34; worthy, up there with his Rain Dogs album.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Laced with the perfect amount of wit and humor. Good performances by Eastwood, Adams and Timberlake. The ending was a little unbelievable, but overall, this is a good film.<br /><br />Baseball fans are sure to enjoy this
B000QRIGLC|5.0|If you have not served in the military, specifically in SPCOPS and are thankful for the freedom which you enjoy everyday; please read this and understand the sacrifice service members put forth to guarantee it.
0385349947|5.0|As a female executive for many years (but certainly not at the level of the author), I identified with so many of the examples of how women have somehow felt and acted uninvited (leaning out) even when they are among the few included in male executive circles.  The same behaviors celebrated in successful male executives are penalized for females.  I appreciate that there was none of the typical male bashing, but more of an inclusive education and suggestions for how we can all come together (lean in) to continue to improve the life sharing for both genders and all career and home choices.  Extremely well written and direct - easy to read.
B009FZFONO|2.0|'Shouldn't have killed off Andrea. Clearly a cop out way of cleaning up the writing mess that made Andrea so loathed by other characters (and fans). And the WAY she died ... not credible. We've seen Andrea do more with less. That one walker could do that was not believable. The TWD writers & producers are reacting to the backlash by saying her death will have meaning in Season 4. I can't imagine the great storylines of which Andrea could've been a part. &#34;Meaning&#34; or not, her character was worth more alive than dead. Laurie Holden was an asset to the show. Won't be the same without her.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It's a good movie, I like history it's interesting and I needed to watch for my history class, really enjoyed watching it.
B0035XQW74|5.0|This movie is awesome leaves you thinkin bout things and always wanting to know what happens next not to mention some damn good acting
B003CNQPNS|3.0|Only a couple of discs through the set but all okay so far. Packaging was a little damaged, but so far no damage found to the discs.
B00BF123WG|4.0|My wife and I watched this recently and really enjoyed the intensity of the final scenes even if you already know how it ends!
B002QCD2OG|5.0|Interesting in its own right, and a good horror story that works in a way you probably aren't used to.  Must-see for film buffs.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|Despite a great cast, &#34;This Is 40&#34; is not particularly funny and is stocked with unlikeable, egotistical characters. Sure, all adults remain children, but most, we must hope, aren't as selfish and crude as these.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|i really enjoyed the book for it adventure and excitement.  It is a quick read which will keep you on your toes.<br />I like Nelson DeMile books and this one had its only twist.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|I orginially watched this film because it happened in and through my hometown of Findlay, Ohio, and the engineer who eventually climbed aboard and stopped it was also from Findlay.  I have since purchased it and watch it over and over because I love it.  The secondary plot line for each character is a bit lackluster but it's not paramount to the heart of the movie which is brilliantly shot and edited to give viewers the feel of speed and sound. Having grown up in the prime era of train travel, the sights and sounds are authentic and stirring. If you have a home theater with surround sound, it's simply terrific!!<br /><br />This is a film that is fun, fast, and loud. There is a minimum of \\"language\\" and no content you wouldn't want your kids or your mom to see. If you want absolute accuracy and complete believability in a film, select something else.  If you want a fast paced ride of just plain fun for an hour an a half, this is your movie.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I was expecting a lot more bases on all the hype up to the release. Glad I didn't waste the $$$$a at the box office as this was just ok.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Well, I didn't buy this expecting anything much better, but after all the hype and the cliffhanger ending of the first one I figured I'd try it. It really is trash-poor writing, and boring. I have gone on to other books and can't be bothered to finish it (read 2/3) or to buy the third one. I'm sure I will find it in a garage sale somewhere if my curiosity gets the better of me.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|The Kindle version will allow me to watch the person guess my drawing and then if they get it, the graphics to show the coin awarding crash the game every time.  I get some message saying that my Kindle can't handle all that and the game just closes.  I play this on my HTC 3D since I can't play it on my Kindle.  Not happy!
B00AE2LJVS|3.0|Not bad I seen a lot worse  It was decent . I got in on a special so  I didnt pay much
B00BWJARHO|4.0|very action packed,. full of fun action and awesome storyline, lookin forward to sequel,. I hope they do one soon,
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Very Uesful and takes no room at all. Will be getting another one as soon as I can.  THanks alot.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|If you are looking for a deep, moving plot, look elsewhere my friend. But if you are simply looking for a decent action movie with cool cars and decent action, this will do juuuuuust fine.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The first time I saw this movie (when it was released) I was really focused on the book and what was NOT in it.  This time, with a bit of perspective, I watched it more as a standalone movie.  Jennifer Lawrence really does an excellent job of being a terrified teenage girl.  I really enjoyed watching it again and recommend it even for those who have not read the books.
B008PWN0I4|5.0|Bought this back in February for my iPod Classic and it works exactly as advertised. Pairing was easy and fast with both my Bluetooth headset and speakers (need to try it in my car next even though the factory radio has iPod controls). With my Bluetooth headset (a very old Motorola S805 circa 2007), I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to control the iPod from the headset as far as being able to pause music, track back and forth, and adjust volume. iPod battery life hasn't suffered noticeably and generally last longer than my Bluetooth speakers and about equal to my headset. Works great with either of the cases I have and is barely noticeable.<br /><br />Well worth the price and has given new life to my iPod Classic after selling my iPhone 3GS last year and went to an Android phone. Yes I know I can load music on my Android but I like the ease of syncing with iTunes and having all my playlist there. Plus I like the ability to rate music and the Genius list I can create. Great product!
B004RL9T50|4.0|I watched this movie on a dull Sunday afternoon because I wanted to just sit quietly for a few hours.  It was better than I thought it would be, and held my attention!  The graphics (not sure if it would be called graphics like a video game) on these movies Dreamworks make are just incredible.  WOW.  The story was somewhat simple and such, but I realize I was not the target audience for this movie as a 29 year old.  So I took it for what it was, mindless entertainment.  Great soundtrack!!
B0054SMIH6|4.0|Almost 5 stars ... would have been five stars except I found the plot to be a bit predictable.  Enjoyed the movie a lot, however.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Got this for my BF as a Valentine gift.  He LOVES it.  Took him back to his glory days - and that's a good thang.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This was a highly entertaining book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and found it hard to put down.It had some great visual descriptions that made me laugh! It's a very memorable book. It was a great expose on Aspergers.  I look forward to another book by this author.
B000IOM0WE|5.0|I love this movie! Its very futuristic, nice story too. Very detail oriented. Blu-ray quality makes it very enjoyable to watch. Recommend!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I'm very glad I found this book.  It was so interesting that I ordered Good Calories, Bad Calories and started learning more about diet.  As a type 2 diabetic, who 'was' obese, I've lost 40 pounds in 4 months, and my A1C has improved and I feel great, and I followed the principals outlined in this book. I've also recommended this to my close friends and family as well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you like these movies you should love this one and it has the best David Banner yet!!! This movie has it all.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|In his last 3 films. Malick has perfected cinematic technique to make it an act of contemplation, in fact,<br />Christian contemplation.  Film heir of Thomas Merton?  He engages the viewer in a whole new way, uniquely his own. with the inner monologue as revelation of inwardness.  The poetry of spirit, its inhalations & exhalation, its sufferings and redemptions.<br />This film is not the master work that \\"The Tree of Life\\"is, but it offers satisfactions that no other film in US theatres will.  The final<br />half hour is a summary & crescendo of the previous narrative.  The sequence accompanying Gorecki's music is as exquisite as anything Malick has done.
0307352153|4.0|Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World Than Can't Stop Talking explains many things that I have wondered about. I found it interesting that so much research has already been done on what makes people introverted or extroverted. It is well worth the read, especially if you are an introvert looking for a job in this tight economy.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Couldn't stop reading! Immediately started looking for more books written by Gillian Flynn!! Couldn't put the book down, in one word GREAT!!!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is the second one I have bought. Love it for WOW better than the razor one I had. So i got my son one too.
B0094M2S5A|4.0|I was highly disappointed when I tried to stream with my Roku 3 using the 5.1 surround sound setting on the Roku... no audio.  It was necessary to check on the internet to find a work-around used by others... Change the Roku 3 setting to Stereo... watch the movie... and then reset the Roku 3 back to surround sound for other viewing.
B000UYX4OK|5.0|The better version of this movie from Iceland. Makes the story human and shows both sides well. Be careful your actions can come back to haunt you.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Plays well on the Nabi xd and the graphics are top notch for any game let alone a free one.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|V for Vendetta for gods sake. The modern version of Orwell's 1984, all the warnings and traps that the world is heading into and how to identify and eventually defeat it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|We have a ranch going on our kindle.  Enjoyed by teen and younger son.  Check it frequently to make sure the horses are doing well.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I use it all the time on my phone, and it's so great for unexpected waits at stores, doctor appointments, etc.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Fun for all ages.  Everyone takes turns cutting, coloring and cutting again.  Even the dad took a few turns styling.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I love this movie! It has such great way of showing some of the history with racism through a funny, yet serious, and intriguing story. I would recommend it to anyone!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Very handy and easy to use.  I use it all the time.  Great when I need to find something and not wake anyone up!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Purchased this a few weeks ago and started the diet this week.<br />Not struggling at all.<br />Book was great and if I get the benefits of this I will be very pleased indeed.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this! Great when you're waiting and bored. I let my grandkids play it when they get restless. It's free and you can't beat that price!
6305696071|5.0|never gets old. There is some footage that was left out of the original release that I thouroughly enjoyed watching
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|when streaming videos the audio and video stops playing at 57sec on every video ive tryed to play. if it worked it would be great.
B001CZJKS0|3.0|a must have i dont all ways say this but it was a bit of a not so good box set
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|This product Works exactly like could do it. Clear sound, no problema with device just plug on IPod terminal on your device and plug the other side on the Smartphone or any other (Non IPod) device  Recommended. Tested and Works perfect with Nokia 920 :)
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I vote five stars because it's funny, amazing, and easy to read. That's why I love diary of a wimpy kids!!!!!!!
1616550414|5.0|Rich with images and written detail from the Legend of Zelda series I love so very much. A great read!
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|The final season wrapped up loose ends and is an entertaining take on the Arthurian legend.  Am sorry the show is over.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|funny and entertaining. 20 minute long so perfect show to watch. love sheldon. you should totally start watching it today
B0063IH60K|5.0|Basic Solitaire app. No unneeded bells and whistles, just lets you play the basic game. I do like that when you deal the cards you can choose a winning deal if you really don't want a challenge. The ads are minimal and don't interfere with gameplay.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Liked the technical aspects of the book: the explanation action of the physics, etc.  There was just enough suspense that you felt Watney just might not make it.  I would give it four stars.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Awesome app. Great replacement for Google Reader, very easy to use. Easier to share material than Google reader. Love the browser add-in, too.
0312330863|5.0|I read it in Russian twenty years ago. I loved the book than, and I like it now. The author has a good sense of humor and uses an expended vocabulary, I helps me to learn more English.
B008K3N68M|5.0|Season One had me completely sucked in, and I must say that season two did not disappoint.  The passion and intrigue continues, and the characters are expanded upon and I found myself feeling as though I were in the show with them.  Like last season, the clothes and setting are gorgeous and do a good job of portraying the time period.  Looking forward to season three!
B007SUW24W|5.0|I also love this cd but he is a little bit of a downer. I pefer a more positive vibe. .  I was surprised to hear he is only 22. His Lyrics are so beautiful and poetic. He is so talanted and full of emotional. I really love the following tracks.: Give Me Love, Kiss Me, Lego House, & This
B008M0TMXQ|3.0|I thought these were a little cuter than normal crocs. They are definitely trimmer and the silver color was quite fun. Unfortunately the pair I bought didn't fit. I am between and 8 and 9 and thought the recommendation was to go down a size. When I tried them on, however, they felt tight and uncomfortable.I later saw a different recommendation to size up for Crocs if between and probably would have liked them better that way. Ultimately I returned them and decided not to get the next size up. The sides of the shoe also seemed a little low to me and I wasn't confident that would fit better with the larger size.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I watched when show was previewed originally. Great concept, some acting weak for main character but fabulous fight scenes.<br /><br />Definitely worth downloading!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Here in one place is every idea or recipie that you've ever wanted, needed or didn't even know about. Pinterest changes your entire lfe...in a wonderfully addicting way. Try it in the middle of the night when you can't sleep ...amazing!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading, period.  The author was able to show the real heartbreak of a child left alone and the true wonder of finding the truth.
B003XTYDMQ|2.0|It would not download no matter what I tried.  I paid for it and never received it.  I have bought many things at Amazon and am very disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's fun to play and you get 2  see how little it was before how big it is now love it
B007HACDLK|5.0|I love it! Rapp is the king of getting down to business without borders against terrorism. Too bad., he's getting older.
0446547603|4.0|I bought this book for my wife.  She thoroughly enjoyed the book.  She liked the book but a little short of She loved the book.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|There always that sort of expectation when you know the story is led by John Corey. I'm thinking, when is he going to face some real bad guys. Got to say this-- he's got the character, yet Harry Bosch can thrill him with some more of his investigative prowess.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great version of the game. The only I take issue with is that every new game is interrupted at the beginning for an advertisement.  However since it free I'm to put up with this quirk.
B009CYCF5I|5.0|I have never been disappointed in a PINK album. She has such powerful vocals and most of her music is deeply meaningful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I played this on a kindle fire that belongs to a friend.Anyway, loved the graphics.Ready to add it to mine.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this move because it has that twilight girl in it, but I did love it!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|Such a good US TV series. Great writing, interesting characters, scary plot lines. Can't wait until the next series becomes available.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had some down time so I decided to watch EVERY episode available from the first one. I am hooked and cannot wait until the newest season starts!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really fun book.  Lots of action,  Lots of humor.  Fascinating how he problem solves his way through his ordeal.  Highly recommended!
B007HACDLK|3.0|there are worse ways to pass the time I suppose.  Not as much fun as earlier works in this series.
030758836X|3.0|I must admit, this book was kind of a roller coaster for me.  At first I was sucked in and couldn't put it down.  Not to give any spoilers, but a man's wife disappears under mysterious circumstances.  The man acts suspiciously and makes some statements that seem very disturbing.  At the same time we find that the wife was very, very, very unhappy and their marriage was on the rocks.<br /><br />The book is divided into three sections. Toward the end of the first part I nearly shelved the book and added it to my collection of books I started but never finished.  Then I ran into a twist in the middle and it sucked me in again.  I finished the book because I had hopes of the book getting better.  It never really did though.  What happened next was somewhat predictable and what happened in the end was tragic IMO.  You read the book hoping the villain will get their comeuppance in the end, but in this book it never happens.  This disappointed me to no end.
1558908366|5.0|The best example of a Fariy Tale love story ever.<br /> Julia Roberts is brilliant in this movie.<br /> A must have for any collector.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I put this book on my reading lit due to a Wall Street Journal review.  Contributing to this choice was the relatively low cost for the ebook version.  Deep down I'm still a paper kind of guy but the low cost ($5.99) coupled with the immediate gratification convinced me to try.  I enjoyed the book and liked the ebook (Kindle) format. Looking forward to what I expect will be a more books in this series.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I started watching season 1 on Netflix, all 6 episodes in one night and it was awesome! Then season 2 came out, and I waited for it to be released on Netflix. And it was pretty good, but didn't require me to lose an entire weekend to it (I think I spread it out over two weeks). And then came season 3. I couldn't wait. I bought each episode on Amazon (no cable) and it was totally worth it!! Best season yet.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I play MMO's mainly and had been using Naga's.  My last two Naga's had trouble with the right click button a little over a year after purchase.  After reading the reviews for Anker's Gaming Mouse, I decided to give it a try and have been very pleased with this mouse.  It fits my hand great, has nice control and is very easy to program.  It didn't take long at all to learn the button positions and I can see myself using this mouse for a very long time to come.  Highly recommend to any gamer looking for something with programmable buttons and great precision.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I had a friend recommend Colleen Hoover to me with Hopeless. I fell in love with her writing. When the same friend told me about Slammed, I knew I had to read it and knew I would love it. It is an emotional ride but well worth it. It will keep you waiting and wanting more. A perfectly written love story.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Just a fun, romantic story with great actors! Was funny and heartfelt. I was pleasantly surprised to have a quality movie from the story description.
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|This boom was good I found some parts more I interesting than others, but I like the songs randomly dispersed throughout the book. I would definitely recommend this book if you are good at not easily looking track of things
B002N57KG2|5.0|Cannonball Run Is on my favorite movie list. The cast was just right for this movie. Dom Deluise and Burt Reynolds are great pair. Loved the Sea to Shining Sea Race. Ray Stevens Did a great job doing the Title Song..it is very catchy.<br />I have watch this a few times now and sokme of the lines get stuck in my head and I can quote them. I give this movie 5 stars! I highly reccomend this movie to everyone!
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Never heard it but took a chance and i like it quite. soothing I think but just a bit dancy
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Finally a movie I can put on that is equally entertaining for me and my kids. In fact I probably enjoyed it more than my kids did.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This may work better on other screens, but on the Kindle most of the games had pieces you had to find that were off screen. Made the game quite frustrating. It was fun, but I am not sure I would recommend it for kids. Quite a few of the puzzles and the dialog had references to smoking and things I am not sure are quite appropriate for a younger audience. I never saw a rating, so maybe it isn't intended for younger people.  If they could fix the issue with items being outside the Kindle field of vision, it would be a much better game.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had seen the Imax version at the theater.  I wanted it for my own collection.  The movie is awesome if you are a fan of Tolkien--I am a huge fan!
B008O2T3O0|3.0|I keep posting this complaint, but I mean, for Blu Ray or DVD, the characters should be believable in my opinion. Stop the middle aged people over 40 (here, Elena Moșuc is supposed to be around 50!) playing 16 year old girls, especially as main character please! It's so ridiculous!
B00003CXD0|5.0|This is a hilarious movie with intelligent dialogue and a great message.  Dustin Hoffman is brilliant and Bill Murray appears as Hoffman's roommate in one of his funniest and most underrated roles ever!
0761171703|5.0|I bought three - one to keep and two to share.  It is an antidote for any ailment of the body or the spirit.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a great app, really just what I needed as I never seem to be able to find a regular calculator when I need one!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I find this book amazing. Its really creative, imaginative, descriptive. I had a really good time reading it. The way the writer describes the characters and places makes you feel like if you were there, he makes you feel that you are part of the story;  looking at everything that is happening.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I watched the movie a month ago and after seeing it, it left me wondering \\"What the heck just happened here?!\\" I figured I'd get the book because PERHAPS it would answer some of my lingering questions. What happened to his aunt? What did she do to him? Who was he writing to? What is wrong with Charlie? Although the book answered a few questions I had from the movie, the book proved to be poorly written as a first had account about a boring character. In the first half of the book I must have seen the word \\"incidentally\\" used over a dozen times! First thing, I've never heard a 15 year old use this word and secondly, it didn't even make sense when used. That is just the beginning of the gripes I have about this book, but I won't bore you here about them. If you are young perhaps this book would be interesting to you but as an adult I found it to be cliche and monotonous the whole way through. Final thoughts: Don't bother.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is fun to play and helps me past time. I enjoy running away from a giant monkey. Also I like jumping over things.
B00000J2PH|3.0|I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RECORDING.  IT IS VERY SLOW, BORING AND THE MUSIC ISN'T GOOD WHATSOEVER, ALTHOUGH SHE IS A VERY EXCELLENT MUSICIAN.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I'm a big fan of Tarantino's films and he continues to deliver a solid line-up.<br />I wasn't sold on seeing Django in theaters, the trailer didn't inspire me and the time period the movie is set in just generally disinterests me.<br />I'm glad I finally watched it though, it was a good story, with like-able characters. It's not as action-packed as his other films, but there is still some good action in there, and when it's in there, it's as bloody and fun as anything he's ever done.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|I've been anxiously awaiting this Blu Ray, as after seeing it on SHOWTIME it really exposes all the angles and many unanswered questions as to what happened to the Eagles in the late 70's and also in particular, Don Felder, which you have to read his book \\"Heaven & Hell with the Eagles\\" to get the full picture.<br />That said, there is so much footage from the 70's we've never seen before, one wonders how they kept all this private until now. To see how the story unfolds from day one when Frey and Henley played in a band with Linda Rondstadt and broke off into their own band is simply fascinating... I could write a book on this DVD/BR, but you'll have to buy it for yourself to fully appreciate what the Eagles went through all those years.<br />The Audio: recorded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is truly outstanding. They really did a great job in using all the surround channels, hence making you feel as though you're in the audience when watching their concert (separate disk that comes with this set), and also anytime their shown playing together on Part-1 & Part-2.<br />The Video:<br />For the most part the video looks very good in 1080p, but during certain parts like when they flash back to \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" and some of Henley and Frey's solo footage the video becomes grainy almost to the point its annoying. Its the disk, not your player or HD tv, as I have an Oppo-BDP-95 Blu ray player and one of Samsung's higher end HD tv's. The graininess is tolerable, but its the only reason I didn't score this 3 disk set with a 5. If you're a audiophile such as I, then this is one for your reference collection.<br />To see Felder and Walsh playing in their heyday together (especially Hotel California) is truly brilliant. Its so unfortunate Felder and Frey couldn't move past their issues and keep Felder in the band, as he's every bit as much as an Eagle as any of them. Anyway, this is a great story about one of America's greatest, most successful bands of all time, so buy it while you can, as $30 is a small investment for such an outstanding story of how the Eagles gained so much success and fame throughout the world during their 40 years of tremendous success! Definitely one of my favorite bands! I hope you enjoy this story as much as I did.
B009AP2G26|5.0|full of beer, bros and bountiful betties, this episode made me laugh like all the others. great job, glee kids!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This is a movie we've watched again and again. Great music and heartwarming stories. One of our family favorites, for sure.
B007WFQZBY|5.0|Just really dig the Liars and everything that they put out.  It's always a surprise!  And this time was no different...Loved it.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I did not catch this movie in the theater but the ads for it looked like it would be funny.  I decided to rent it on Amazon and it did not disappoint.  It is so cute, I decided to order for one of my nieces for her birthday.  Loved the house/hotel in the movie and the father/daughter relationship.  If you like animated movies, this is a very cute one.  I'd recommend.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|More loose ends than answers!  had to read the entire book without putting it down!  Not as great as the previous 2 but very good all the same!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|Wonderful book. Thought I had read all Sherlock Holmes stories, I was wrong. Great reading if you only have time for a short storie
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Applause...applause....applause...lucky for me, the next one in the series is ready.<br />I shall buy as soon as I finish here...
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The role Jennifer Lawrence played against the backdrop of characatures, imaginative costumes, and a fantastical world plus an outrageous role played by Stanley Tucci!
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|I've only watched the 1977 concert so far, but it is absolutely a must have to see/hear them at the peak of their career (pre-reunion). Just hearing the great Randy Meisner doing a live version of \\"Take It to the Limit\\" is worth the entire price of the set. The sound quality is amazingly good for a concert recording from the 70s. No Eagles fan should not have this in their collection. I would have to agree with the other review that it is disappointing they didn't include the entire concert. Hopefully, someday they will do so.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Absolutely love this cd, bought the mp3 version and put it right into iTunes and on my phone! So quick and easy to listen to my favorite cd!
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|What else is there to say?  The left click no longer has any effect.  It's also slippery and the buttons for one's thumb are positioned in a way that is awkward to press them without losing control of the mouse.<br /><br />EDIT:  My phone rang yesterday and lo and behold it was Anker Direct offering to send me a brand new mouse.  They read this review, found my contact info and gave me a call. Needless to say I was VERY impressed.  With that kind of attention to their customers, I can't help be give them the credit they deserve.  I'm adding a star for that alone.<br /><br />PS; The phone call came just HOURS after posting the original review.  Now that's what I call service...
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|The movie is great, and I am surprised I could receive it so soon after seeing it in theaters.  I love the music.
B009AMANH4|1.0|Totally overrated.<br /><br />So you have the name Spielberg attached to it, a beautiful production and cast and Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis...<br /><br />HOWEVER, underneath all that, this is one BORING film.<br /><br />What do we go to to the movies for? Mostly entertainment. Spielberg and this film seems to totally forget that element.<br /><br />It's obvious the screenwriter is more of a playwright than knowing the smooth flow, dramatic transitioning, and pacing translating it on film. The film is just talking heads the entire film and seems better suited for a stage performance or TV series.<br /><br />In the making, they mentioned the first draft of the screenplay was over 500 pages (generally, one page is worth 1 minute of screen time); so, originally, it would have been over an 8 hour film. Spielberg had to cut it down a lot, and he decided the most important part of the book adaptation was the \\"13th Amendment\\" section.<br /><br />The title of the film \\"Lincoln\\" is very misleading. It really should have just been called \\"13th Amendment\\" but of course that would be a horrible marketing title. I mean, there's a few scenes where they tried to show the personal side of Lincoln and his family, like the relationship with Lincoln and his son (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) but it really doesn't go anywhere and feels totally incomplete.<br /><br />If one really had no idea or ever heard of who Lincoln was, they really wouldn't get much out of this film either.<br /><br />The whole film just focuses on trying to pass the \\"13th Amendment\\" with Lincoln hiring men to convince Democrats to switch their votes. It's extremely boring and frustrating to watch and listen. You might as well watch C-Span. The pacing of the film is really horrible and it drags the entire time from start to finish -- there really is no high point -- yet the ending feels completely rushed.<br /><br />This is by far the most boring film Spielberg has ever produced. Don't be fooled by high production visuals/set and performance.<br /><br />This may be enjoyed by history critics (whether they agree with its accuracy or not), but for people who are looking for a full pleasurable movie-going experience, this film is not it, especially if you don't care for politics.<br /><br />I also feel Denzel Washington was robbed for Best Actor in [[ASIN:B00AF6B22E Flight]] for the Oscars; his performance was much more powerful throughout the entire film than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Even a 6 year old can play as Lincoln on a school play...<br /><br />This film is nowhere near Schindler's List quality. If you need a cure for insomnia, play this film.tion visuals/set and performance.<br /><br />This may be enjoyed by history critics (whether they agree with its accuracy or not), but for people who are looking for a full pleasurable movie-going experience, this film is not it, especially if you don't care for politics.<br /><br />I also feel Denzel Washington was robbed for Best Actor in [[ASIN:B00AF6B22E Flight]] for the Oscars; his performance was much more powerful throughout the entire film than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln.

B009AMANH4|5.0|Steven Speilberg has crafted a stunning film. Brilliantly acted by all with highest praise to Daniel Day Lewis who is perfect as Lincoln. Instant Classic !!
B000UZPIAW|5.0|This book hit home on many points - causing me to analyze things about my life.  It was honest, truthful, very well written, and definitely an inspiring read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|COOL GAME :) like how it's challenging &amp; the tilting is pretty cool too. My son's better then his momma at this game. He loves it
B0063M22QO|5.0|Surprisingly a very good version especially for free.  Several different puzzle layout options. No complaints, I recommend this version of Mahjong.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are so talented! I'm a big fan! I've already preordered several of their next album to give as Mother's Day gifts.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is one of the best 007 movies ever made.  I originally saw this movie at the theater and was blown away.  This is a must buy for any James Bond fans.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|It was not written for the American market. Many Americans have no idea where any of these places are at. Many Americans also can't relate to sheep herding either. Why did it sell here then?...I have no earthly idea. I found it barely interesting. The story lacked any plot points. There was no story arc. The characters were basic at best, boring at worst. The predictable twist at the end offered no surprise or insight into the greatness of the universe. In short, I wasted my money.
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|Seriously though I look nothing like the God of Thunder, not in the least. The only thing he and I do share is the name Thor. I was happy to see that I found this little set where I could get the LEGO figure Thor without having to pay $50 to $70 dollars for one of the bigger sets just to get him. I'm not a huge fan of the Cosmic Cube set itself but it is nice addition to the figure.<br /><br />If you are looking to get a LEGO Thor without buying the figure alone for $10 or paying upwards to $70 for one of the bigger sets just to get the God of Thunder himself. Then this is the best bet for you and the Cosmic Cube he comes with is a near plus although a little lacking in the detail department.
B009MYAQK4|1.0|This is a WORK OF FICTION. It is supposedly based on a manuscript found in Egypt. This is supposed to be some great text, but even the Egyptians didn't care if it left the country. In my opinion, the fictional discoverer should have left it where he found it. Once again the author has no understanding of basic storytelling techniques. There is no plot structure, no story arc, no great struggle on the part of any character which may sneak through. I bought several books by this author at one time thinking they would be good because after all he is such a famous author. WRONG! I want my money back.
1616550414|5.0|I was extremely exited when they announced that they would be giving a North America version of the LoZ:Hyrule Historia. I knew I had to get one of my own. My expectations were blow out of the water when I received my package containing my very own copy. Not only is it a wealth of knowledge and facts about The Legend of Zelda universe but is a work of art itself, at least I think so. The cover is just breathtaking and the artwork done by Dark Horse Comics lives up to their level of quality they bring to all of their projects. It also has concept art and development stories of how our favorite characters were brought to life in the game series that have given joy to us all. I have been a life long Legend of Zelda fan and I can say that if you are just discovering the Legend of Zelda or if you've been with it since the beginning like I have. Then you need to add this to your library and cherish it for a long time to come.
B000JMKNZQ|2.0|I found this elementary at best. Nothing profound and enlightening in it. I have been trying to understand why this is such a great seller for the author and then it struck me. It was written to speak to the novice of metaphysics not someone who has studied for decades. Not that I am a master yet, but it was a basic guide only. I was very disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The book had a great love story besides the interesting sex scenes.<br />Keeps you involved enougn to want the next installment.
B002GNTDTI|5.0|I've never been much into Superman, but this series really caught my attention and held it until the very end. Tom Welling is amazing and this show could not have been better! The characters are loveable, diverse, and captivating. The show itself is interesting and exciting always. It's my all-time favorite show and I highly recommend!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|This is exactly what I was expecting to receive and completely in good conditions.<br />Works perfect with my computer and sounds great!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|You'll fall in love with the laughs this show has to offer. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone who likes to laugh and doesn't mind a few sexual innuendos here and there.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Once you start, you can't put it down.  I've finished this one, time travel and experiments.  just waiting for ne levels to come out.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I own all five seasons of this show and watch them over and over - they're funny every time. I think sometimes I like re-watching the earlier seasons better than the later, but they are all five-star. They're hilarious and entertaining, and rarely let the viewer down. I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo every now and again.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|The subject and the way the book is written are both outstanding. There are lessons to be learned from both Jobs and Isaacson. This is an unpretentious look at an amazing character who changed our world in ways that only a genius could.
B009IF7092|5.0|I love this show and wait in anticipation for each new episode to air. I'm rarely disappointed and always laugh. I highly recommend this show to any and all. Watch it, it's hilarious!
B005D4YOQY|5.0|This sandal fits well and has great support. It is not open toe so it provides protection for the front of your feet. It appears to be very durable and it does not get slippery in water. I really like it!
B001G50QCU|5.0|After losing the character(s) we have, this season surprised with being just as great if not greater than the previous ones. The new characters totally make up for the one(s) who left. I highly recommend this show.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really love this game it is challenging and fun to talk to people all over the world. I love the challenge of completing a room...love it...
B005P4PAZG|5.0|It's hilarious, entertaining, and sometimes even wild! If you want a good laugh, watch this show, because it's great. I highly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|My Horse Review<br /><br />My Horse is okay I like DragonVale<br />better.<br /><br />because this game is okay but DragonVale is much better.
B0044LNR88|5.0|The show goes out with a bang, but i was a little disappointed with the final finale. I love this show and will re-watch and all. I highly recommend, but be warned that you may want to un-watch the final episode.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Really enjoyed delving into the lives of these characters. It was a thoroughly entertaining book with a message of hope and redemption
B000W91RUG|5.0|This show is hilarious! I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo here and there.
B005LAIGRS|3.0|The acting is no more than adequate to carry this totally action-oriented shoot-em-up.  But then, the action never slows down enough to allow for much acting.  The story is simple -- Denzel Washington, a veteran CIA field operative gone rogue, is being hunted down by teams of assassins.  His attempt to escape, accompanied by a rookie CIA \\"housekeeper\\" who falls into his orbit, is accomplished via car-chases followed by foot races followed by shootouts followed by fistfights followed by variations on all the above.  This is all done quite well but seems like a waste of a good cast and other resources that could have been turned to presenting a more complex story relying less on stunts and gunfire.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show is hilarious! If you haven't seen it, you haven't laughed at anything funny yet. I highly recommend this show to any and all who like to laugh and don't mind a sexual innuendo here and there.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I suffer from anxiety, it gives me something to occupy my mind. My great grams taught me how to play when I was little. Love it.
B00BQ1DATU|5.0|Great album, similar sound to Fields but a little more chill and none of the long jams.  Its great, get it!
B009X01ELC|4.0|My husband is using it and really likes it as it hold the kindle in place safely.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Really enjoyed watching it with the hubby... Can't wait till my little one gets old enough to really enjoy it!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing, can't wait to read the third, so suspenseful. I couldn't stop reading! Buy it now, don't even think about not.
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Imagine the Stones and Aerosmith still wrote killer tunes , throw in some Cinderella and a bit of the Beatles and what you have is &#34; The Way Life Goes &#34; its amazing from start to finish . I've listen to at least a dozen times now , and every time I find a new favorite song . The  wait was worth it . Thanks Tom !
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book addresses may ideas if one wishes to grow as a leader.  It has excellent references to studies regarding leadership and why some things work and some do not.  ..An excellent book.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|First Bought app off of the sight. Good Choice, Free play is a bonus, but limitation such as no proper nouns gets annoying, and makes you think outside of the box.
B004K6LJ3W|2.0|I LOVE this show and was so excited to get the set, but...even though it says &#34;any region&#34; I cannot get it to play on my blu ray player. I'm very disappointed and if anyone has a suggestion to get it to play...let me know.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't like to run, but this show made it bearable.  And I like Noah, even scruffy and dirty.  'nuff said.
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|I think it's safe to say that punk rockers don't tend to age well. Iggy is in his 60s and the James Williamson is returning after a multi-decade musical hiatus as the Vice President of Technology Standards for Sony.  So far, so good, right?<br /><br />The album's opening track instantly sucked me in with its powerful, raw guitar and timing errors intentionally left intact.  Sex and Money is also great - complete with a horn section and an impressive vocal performance.  The blue-collar imagery from \\"Job\\" seems a little ironic given that it is coming from a successful rock star with a Vice President shredding the guitar by his side but it manages to come off as slightly tongue-in-cheek.<br /><br />Gun is possibly my favorite track and sounds like a cleaned up version of something from Raw Power (the guitar line is similar to Search and Destroy and the cadence is similar Your Pretty Face Is Going To Hell).  The guitar work by Williamson is top notch and he has a unique style that really shines in this song.  The lyrics on this album are generally not the most poetic (if lyrics are a deal-breaker I would proceed with caution) but I would put Gun among the better songs lyrically.  The other contender for \\"best of\\" is the title track.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting much but this is surprisingly good.  It has overly silly moments such as DD's (it is about exactly what you might suspect given the title and it starts out sounding not unlike a Ska song from the 90s if that gives you an idea of what you're in for).  It has some interesting diversions like \\"Unfriendly World\\" where Pop becomes a manic cowboy with a bad case of nostalgia.  It's not a magnum opus (I don't think they were trying to create a masterpiece based on interviews).  But, if you're looking for some good rock and roll, Ready to Die gets the job done nicely and is totally worth buying.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I really like this game. It is calming and relaxing. I love the background music and the fish are awesome.
B002RI9UBS|2.0|After hearing great reviews I was really disappointed with this book. It was laboriously boring till they reached the boat and then so unrealistic it bordered on sci fi. I didn't enjoy this book.
0547884591|4.0|I enjoy the recipes and have learned a few tricks.<br /><br />What I don't like is the organization. It tries to be helpful with color coding (nice) but it splits up a lot of tips in a method I can't fathom.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|I have always enjoyed watching Cirque Du Soleil unfortunately have never had the opportunity to see a live show.  I really loved watching this one as well, their performances are just so amazing.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|I saw the previews on ABC television when this film was the talk of 1983. I was not at all primed for what I watched those next two uninterrupted hours. I remember President Reagan coming on immediately after the telecast admonishing the public to stay sober and that the country was nowhere near the stage of this film. Well, that's what politicians are supposed to say. I later read he was as shook up as everyone else. He sat depressed by himself for a long time after his private screening.<br /> There is a denominator commentary in the film that addresses our capacity to block out reminders of our mortality.The movie does not and nor should it apologize for its transparency of just how people are : sheeple . We witness the simplified bubble-like existance of Lawrence, Kansas, in seemingly mass denial that the unthinkable could happen literally in their back yard and why not literally since a missile silo is twenty yards to the right of the barn.But maybe Im being a bit harsh here. Maybe denial is the best coping mechanism when you live yards away from a live round underground missile silo currently being checked...twice.<br />  The story doesn't build with predictable speeches from brooding academics or senior cynics sitting on porches sipping cider. We get the story the way jaded America gets it : news flashes and testing signals from the emergency broadcasting system on TV screens in the backgrounds of various living rooms of the characters and they treat it as an afterthought...as we do. But select characters heard the breaking news about soviets closing in on Berlin and moiled over a mounting nuclear strike but not where they couldn't retreat to the comfort of the conventional wisdom of \\" ...or maybe they will contain it\\" and use those symphony tickets.<br /><br />  But not the audience. The director keeps the TV loud enough in the background where we can hear and discern the urgency while the girls argue over who hid the birth control pills. There was a scene where little kids were watching TV where a reporter described missiles being air-burst over \\"advancing soviet troops\\" as they showed American air force pilots running to their bombers and what were their parents doing? Walked right by the TV to go have sex! The movie explores motivations in how the mind copes with the inevitable  by instinctively retreating to primal appetites like food and sex which illustrates mans deeper instinctive longing to be told what to do when a crisis hits. The whole essence of our faith in warning systems and voices over speakers telling where to hide and where to meet rides on it...that cocoon of cynical co-dependency finally fails in the face of a power that is sovereign and absolute in its destruction.<br /><br />And this was pretty much how the film revealed the story to us in the first hour...through news flashes and speculative conversations between the jaded and the seasoned everywhere from barbershops to university cafeteria to country kitchens prepping for life's rare highlight: the daughter's wedding.<br /><br />The second hour was not just a storm cloud of Iconic images and sounds of a population caught unprepared, it was an in your face frontal assault against our sensibilities.<br />1)The  sounds we cherish like the quiet cornfields and rustling wheat violated by the unnerving radio squawking of \\" We want to confirm...is this an exercise...negative..repeat..negative. Roger copy...this is not an exercise!\\"<br />2) Downtown shoppers running in a panic horrified at the thought of not enough room in the shelters intercut with Eve setting the table while worrying is there enough potato salad for the guests. ...and then the blood scream as her husband snatches her from making the beds and carries her to the basement...she knows its over.<br />3) The little boy in the backyard frozen with his mouth gaped open watching a missile emerge out of that fenced off sandbox yards away his parked bicycle.<br />4) The disembodied voice in thechaotic supermarket yelling, \\"just get the canned goods...the batteries.\\"<br />5) Dr. Oats listening to emergency broadcast instructions while driving alone on the expressway as gridlock clogs the opposite direction.<br />6) Doctors rush into the hospital courtyard to see missile trails overhead.<br />7) A football game in a sold out stadium. The players stop. No movement in the  stands as three white smoke trails arc the sky.<br /><br />Intimacy. Innocence. Healing. The winning touchdown replaced with the touch down of an ICBM in twenty minutes. All society signposts vaporized.<br /><br />We are left with a slow disintegration of relationships for the rest of the film. No feel good bonding here. Again, the script doesn't let you exhale. The special effects were more implied than absolute.They didn't have to be absolute because it fit the movie's gritty saturated look of once vibrant colored reds and golds of a Kansas countryside seared into the dirty white ashen gray of an impending nuclear winter that could last six years. The director lingers the camera on scenes of suffering to where its uncomfortable and sometimes excruciating to watch. Self preservation runs amok. Man has thrown his two babies of moral and ethical facilities out with the bath water of commonsense. The rest is anarchy, sticks, and stones.<br /><br /> \\"Is there anybody there...anybody at all.\\" The Professor asks over the CB radio as the movie ends. The film doesn't answer that question. It just takes its place as one of the great movie lines that addresses when man makes eye contact with the insurmountable...and it doesn't blink. Its been thirty years since \\"The Day After\\". The question remains unanswered.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Wasn't sure what to expect but I have to tell you I was pleasantly surprised.  I could have done without the blood sperting out when anyone got shot.  I felt that part was a bit overdone but overall I found it to be very entertaining and a good movie to watch.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I'm reading it now. So far, very enjoyable.  Logical, down to earth, irreverent, smart-a$$ed real look at life through the eyes of Tina Fey. I always liked her. Now I know why.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I was hoping it would be as good as the Lord of The Rings series and trust me it was just as good from beginning to end.  Highly recommend it.  If you enjoyed the series there is no doubt you will enjoy this one.
B00846REIS|5.0|I like the story line, not just sex, it has more depth to the two main people in the book.  I am reading the second one...can't wait to see where it goes.
B000HKYA1I|3.0|a story that allows its plot to gently be exposed as the characters travel to their destination. I enjoyed this tale.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the Fibonacci angle. Spurred to review Phi and other math concepts. I had seen the movie years ago. The book is much better!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|By far the best zombie show ever. The writers are amazing! Who knew a zombie show would be so good!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I found myself still thinking about the characters after I finished reading it. Definitely suggest reading the book before seeing the movie.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|Great app.  Like that with the latest release you can mix sounds.  Would like to be able to use my own sound (mp3 or wav) files.  Constantly asking to rate the app is a bit annoying.
B000FBJFSC|4.0|this is a good read  it is captivating  you want to keep reading to find out how the kids make out in the world  sad and funny at the same time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app does everything I'd ask of an alarm clock.  It deals with recurrence, it offers reasonable alert options, its controls are simple, it is reliable.  What more can one ask?
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I preordered this because, I was so excited when I heard this album was inspired by classic spaghetti western movies. First I wasn't trill. It just was not what I think will be - but every time I listen I am enjoying it even more and more than I had expected! It is definitely different from their previous albums This new one has really grown on me and I cant stop playing it. Excellent vocals and music. If you like Volboeat you will LOVE this album.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|This book was an easy read!  It kept you enfolded in action, suspense and the thrill of what would happen next made me not want to put the book down.  It deserves 5 stars.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|the reason i picked this movie, because of robert downy jr.  and a lot of action, the scenes were great.
0425263916|5.0|Another beautiful love story!  Captures you from the first pages and keeps you reading.  I can harldy wait for the third book in this trilogy!
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|Amy Adams, Clint Eastwood, and Justin Timberland played a great part in this movie.  They played off each other and was well written.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is his usual hillarious self. The book is packed with a lot of suspence and action, and DeMille lives up to his reputation , great.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Well written and well acted. Daniel Craig was excellent in his role as James Bond.  The supporting actors were very good
B005DJREGQ|4.0|I'm in my 30s but I most people went thru shook anyway so you will be able to relate. Pretty good.
0316212377|3.0|What can one say about Iain Banks -- except to praise his wonderfully creative mind for making real for us the many worlds and the minutiae of hundreds of alien environments! I have wathced him through a dozen novels, from The Player of Games, and The Bridge onwards!<br /> Lately, however, his prolific mind -- which sees no boundaries -- has become overly unconstrained... in other words, he needs better editors badly! They would have had him cut out and tighten up several miles of repetitive dialog and redundant description: take for instance the exchanges between multiple Ships (Minds) -- a big part of this story -- which start out as broad humor, and then often devolve into trivial and repetitive inanity. Thought I'd never use the word &#34;trivial&#34; for any of his work... . He better watch out, or he'll turn into another late David Brin, who's been apparently allowed to use no editors whatsoever and has devolved... much to our horror, into a writer with great ideas and mediocre execution.<br /> Even with such current disappointments, there is so much in this novel that is utterly inventive -- like a scene with an old cantankerous mind which lives in isolation and had created its own environment on a desert planet; or the eponymous musical creation -- the Hydrogen Sonata -- and the instrument that produces it. The novel is probably worth reading through quickly just for those descriptions! even if he overexplains the Sonata itself (so that by the third time he launches into describing it... oh, where are his editors!..)<br /> So 3 stars, considering the quality of what's out there ;-) .
B000V39KDO|5.0|My husband and I very much enjoyed this movie. It has a good plotline, though the main point of the movie is about violence. There is also some nudity.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I really did not like the actor playing Captain Wentworth at first - but by the end of the movie I thought &#34;how could anyone not love a man that noble.  This is my favorite version and I loved the book.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I really like the app on the Fire. Works very well; so much so that I pretty much use the app instead of the computer.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This is one of those movies where the laws of physics are suspended and there are a lot of coincidences.  But it is a fun romp and has a feel good end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is triple fun game. Glad it came with my kindle. I will play this till the day I die. So many options. My favorite is when I am in the mining car.<br />Can,t wait for additional upgrades, if they do them.<br />Work
B008K9SG9K|1.0|Don't know how this got so popular. Sounds more like an experiment than a real album. I don't know what is going to define a new generation of music, but this is DEFIANTLY not it.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|good quality when streaming the show. Always like star trek IF your a fan of star trek you well love it too.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The other day I forgot to grab my Kindle when I left for work.  HORRORS!!  What was I going to do for lunch?! I can't eat if I don't have a book to read!  But, the Kindle App saved my day and my lunch.  It seems incredible to me that I could download the app, find the book I was reading in the Amazon cloud, download it to my phone, and have the app automatically sync the book to my latest place read, all in less than 5 minutes.  It's nothing less than magic, IMO.  Although reading on my phone is kind of a drag (I have a small screen), it sure beats not being able to continue enjoying my current book because I was in a fog that particular morning and forgot my paperwhite.  And, it will be an even better backup when I get my next phone with a larger screen.  I give it an enthusiastic 5 thumbs up!  If you don't have the app, what are you waiting for?  It's even FREE!
B0094K20FK|5.0|This film reached back to the essential characteristics that made ST:TOS the cultural landmark that it was. Action based on personal beliefs and the classic thought that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one. The plot develops in nearly Shakespearean fashion with memorable characters and fine direction. the film stands the test of time.
B00000JNO1|5.0|Just got it today-9/27/2015!! I love it!! Awesome!! Fantastic!! Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!! I will be doing all of my shopping here!! Great music store!! Great!! Amazon has everything you could ever imagine or want!! :o)
0679721037|5.0|I had always viewed the use of atomic bombs on Japan as necessary to ending the Pacific Theatre.  However, after researching the events and learning that Japan had actually already surrendered prior to the bombings, this act of terror was completely useless.<br /><br />I'm glad my professor showed me this book; too often Americans remain ignorant of how terrible nuclear bombs can be.  Not only did the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki leave physical scars and death on the people of Japan, it also left lasting social problems of the people affected.  Those affected by the bomb were often mistreated by other Japanese for fear they might contaminate others with the radiation sickness.<br /><br />Read this book, educate yourself.
B00005CDNF|5.0|A++++++++ Great job!! I Just love Amazon & all it has to  offer!!  it has everything you have ever thought of!!:o)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|The characters were interesting, liked the writing style.  Fast read, kept my interest. Would recommend for a summer reading list. Haven't seen the movie yet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app fits my needs for a calculator. I'm satisfied and would suggest it to others.  I've tried others and this one is the best by far.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Clean cache,  unused files and app packages all in one place. It really helps to improve your phone's performance. Easy!
B00BESNKB8|2.0|I should have know better but the fact that it had Russell Crowe drew me in. Thought it might me kinda like kill Bill but it was just dumb. Turned off after 30 min
B007EDYN36|5.0|great read proud of peter for standing up and letting the world know about breast cancer in men, wish he could come to our down and dirty for life here in marion nc  that would help us raise awareness too!!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This is easily the best book I've read in years.  I wanted to read it before watching the film, and now that I've watched the film I know I made the right decision, as the film (while good in its own right) fails to capture the essence of what makes this such an ingenious work.<br /><br />The first half of the book sucks you into six different stories of all different genres and time periods from the past to the future, and as you get adjusted to the new narrator, new language, and new characters of each, you have the pleasure of knowing that at some point the last story you read is going to become a part of the story you're reading now.<br /><br />The sixth section takes place the farthest in the future and sets up your perspective for the whole second half of the book.  You now have the pleasure of going back and finishing each story you began earlier, now with an understanding of where it fits into the \\"grand scheme of things\\".  What began as a series of loosely related tales takes on a more holistic character and everything about the underlying meaning begins to click.<br /><br />What the film makes explicit through a few key lines of dialog, the book allows the reader to figure out on his or her own, a meaning that will be slightly different for everyone but which resonates on a personal, political, and philosophical level.  The questions it provokes about humanity, our institutions, and our place in the universe are of the most profound nature, and it presents them in a way that is not only fun and entertaining but unlike any way you've ever looked at them before.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I love the CD! I would recommend it to everyone.  I will probably get more if they come out.  Thank you!
B005T87QCI|5.0|the game is fun in all bot does not have albino the great hope good I deafeded zues. and I did not unlock any robot in the game
B00AYLTMMM|5.0|This film makes the viewer think about what it must be like to live in a body that is paralyzed but still feels humans' natural impulses. Helen Hunt's portrayal surpasses anything that one might have expected of her. None of the actors disappoint. I probably would not have selected this film for viewing on a plane ride, but it was recommended by a friend and it caused the time to pass unnoticed.
B001NKI60W|5.0|Wow, this is just such a feel good movie.  Bouncy music, perfect casting, a wonderful example of the new trend in having actors acting out the music with their own less than perfect voices, but with their wonderful faces.  Not a false note in any of the performances.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. I wish the ending was a little better. I know that they are making two additional movies to go with this one, but endied at a wierd point.
1609611543|4.0|I have a son-in-law with Celiac disease, and I plan to share this information with him.  What a surprise to learn that wheat affects everyone, not just those with Celiac disease.  This is a must-read for everyone concerned about staying healthy.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Very entertaining.  Relatable to parents that have been there and survived...single, childless, people...not so much. I'd give it a  Thumbs up.
014241722X|5.0|This series keeps boys wanting to read more and more over and over.  So whatever I can do to get more boys to enjoy reading, bring it on, I'll do it.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|We love the Hobbit movie.  My girls have watched it several times already.  I like having the dvd and Blu-ray option.
0761169431|5.0|This book makes from a great birthday or Christmas gift. I purchased several for my son to give to his friends, who now say they'll be his friend for life.
B009MYARIK|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and devour her books with delight but this one I just couldn't get into. While some of the characters were like able the back and forth left me not feeling connected to any of them. Disappointed.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Clear your schedule because this book will pull you in and encompass your life until you finish it. Well written, it makes you think... Highly recommend
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|* Great Cinematography<br />* The story evolves quite well, and it becomes more exhilarating as it progresses.<br />* It is a great movie to watch with your family or your sweetheart.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|My new addiction, I do wish the gems didn't cost so much I really want the huge shark but hopefully once I get my great white leveled up it will more obtainable
B00BQHA0UQ|5.0|I'm a fan of Carlos Vives, and I can say that this is one of the best work he has done, very romantic and simple, unique in its kind.<br />Love it!!!!

B001N1DPDE|3.0|Don't know really what to use this for as my smaller camp knife is already a Mora and this isn't for chopping nor is it long enough to baton with, built solidly but my BK9 gets much more use.
B007MDB71O|4.0|The story is mildly interesting but the special effects are amazing.  Rewiews require a certain number of words so here are the required.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Before this book I thought lifting lighter weight with high reps would give me leaner muscle mass. But now 3 weeks in to following this plan I'm seeing slow but positive results. The next faze for me is to gather all the supplements mentioned in the book to help me reach my goal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The children love this game. It keeps them occupied, especially when you are trying to conduct important business. Great wholesome childrens game compared to most.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|Extraordinary Acting for a musical, not all the voices were as good.  It was so much like a movie, it was distracting that<br />it was a musical too.
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|The movie got panned by critics who are not theologically astute but they are wrong.  Terrance Malick films can't be seen just once.  You have to watch them over and over again to pick up the message.  I have only seen the movie once but what I took away from this film was that it was a profound, very profound actually, meditation on love but especially love in a Christian sense.  The voice overs referring to &#34;the love that loves us&#34; are a subtle hint, as is the name of the movie.  In the movie we learn that the Wonder is Mont St-Michele, one of the most beautiful churches in the world.  The Wonder though at an even deeper level is this &#34;love that loves us&#34;.  While the relationship between Neil and Marina is passionate and powerful at first it eventually fades.  Yet while it is white hot we see the world, through Malick's camera lens, in what reviewer Damon Linker calls a transfigured sense.  Who has not felt this way when they are in love?  There is a deeper point to be made about love though and that comes from Father Quintana (Javier Bardem at his finest).  While Neil and Marina struggle with their love, on again and off again, Father Quintana struggles with love at a much deeper level, sacrificial love, the love of Christ.  It was these scenes, the ones of Father Quintana working with the poor and the drug addicted on the streets as well as giving communion to prisoners, that really spoke to me.  Father Quintana's homilies on love are deep and still have me pondering this love that loves us.  Watch this movie, see it sever times, ponder God's Love.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is a combination of match3 and construction.  When you have enough points earned in the match3 you can start/continue building.<br /><br />I loved the free trial so I got the upgrade to the full version.  I'm so glad I did!<br /><br />The graphics are great.<br /><br />Highly recommended!  Addictive.<br /><br />You'll be glad you got this!
B002NQ3AAQ|5.0|We watch this film in class, and it has a great message. It is a good film to discuss gender stereotypes and social norms. And the students seem to enjoy it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This film should be required watching for all school children in this country.  Essential watching for adults of all ages as well.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is such a great film. We used it in a college course, and the students were able to analyze the film and discuss the relevance of the film to our classwork.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is now my favorite pastime. I love the bright colors but I am beginning to recognize patterns. It beginning to seem like I am playing the same game over and over.
1878424114|5.0|beautifully well written book.  I will recommend this book to all my friends.  A book that you can definitely live by,
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Great adult entertainment. Story line is very good. The acting and dialog keeps you guessing at every turn. I will be ready for the next enstallment.
B002X3V4P2|4.0|Picked this up as a way of recovering some wonderful memories lost via too many moves and divorces :p<br /><br />Soon as I heard some of the tracks I was back in those places. Solid purchase
0765325950|5.0|The 900+ pages of non-stop action makes up for that wretched book where nothing happened except walking, talking, clothing and banners.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson deserves thanks from the long-time fans for completing the series.<br /><br />I have a few lingering questions which irk me, and since I may have missed the answer somewhere along the line, I post them here.<br /><br />(1)  Thom:  At the beginning of WOT, there are broad hints that he can channel.  Perhaps a male Aes Sedai who has avoided notice, and perhaps has lived for a long time?  And at the end of Memory of Light, he is tossing knives which a channeler could avoid, unless there was something special about the knives.  So, was Thom just an ordinary juggler after all?<br /><br />(2) Asmodean: He didn't get resurrected by the Dark One, did he?  Does this mean Graendal used balefire, or that the Dark One got mad at him?<br /><br />(3)  Androl:  Great character.  He seems to have been around for a really long time too, kinda like Thom.  Was there an explanation of him somewhere earlier in the series?<br /><br />(4) Towers of Midnight:  I know what they are, but they aren't in the story so why give the name to the book?<br /><br />(5) The Light:  Remember when Rand fought Ishmael in the sky at Falme?  Black cord attached to Ishmael, light cord attached to Rand?  The cord of light never reappeared in later books, did it? I thought the title Memory of Light indicated that Rand would remember this, but it's not in the story line.<br /><br />(6)  Lanfear:  At the very end, how did she get inside the dome?  She couldn't channel herself in through the dome, and Thom was outside tossing knives.  No suggestion that she charmed her way past Thom.<br /><br />(7) Magical travel:  Let me count the ways.  There are gateways.  Skimming (when you don't know where you're going?).  Physically entering the dream world.  The Ways (did no one ask the Ogiers to shut them down?).  The standing stones (allowing slow travel through an alternative universe; why bother?). By the end, with a few exceptions, only gateways were being used.  Is this just a case of the \\"better technology\\" winning out?<br /><br />(8) Tuon:  Okay, she becomes Empress.  Her empire is in revolt. She's not even sure she wants to be involved in the Last Battle and seems more interested in acquiring new lands.  But wait!  Her empire is in revolt.  Why isn't she racing home to restore order?<br /><br />That's all for now.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie is a cult classic. It's quirky, unique, and fun for all generations. This is the kind of movie that should never die; I mean, it is guaranteed to thrill you, chill you, and fulfill you...

B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love the variety of sounds, and so realistic. Love how easy it is to set up favorite combinations for quick access. I fall asleep to sounds of nature every night.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|I was very disappointed in this purchase, as I did not realize it would be in black and white.  I am not sure I will purchase any further seasons, for fear they are all in black and white.
086571701X|5.0|I thought this book was great.  The perfect overview with good details in each section.  It's very well written for a person wanting to raise their own fish/vegetables together.  For the person looking for additional food security and self sufficiency, this was a good book.  It seems to me that a person could scale this up to larger scale commercial production systems without too much difficulty, though this wasn't really addressed.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|great game fun to play. lots of sharks and hidden objects to find. don't let your battery die or you'll lose your coins &amp; gems back to the last save.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I have an older car, so it didn't come (obviously) with a bluetooth feature.  Now that I have this it works as well as my wife's car with a bluetooth features.
B00BJDARGO|2.0|I love Whitesnake and it's a great performance but......the audio is out of sync with the video. For example, you hear the drummer hit his snare slightly before you see him hit it. The audio is dragging behind the video. Very annoying and inexcusable. I've ordered the DVD/CD combo and hope the DVD does not have this flaw. I'll watch (and listen) to that despite the superior picture on the blu-ray.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|The second season focuses on the Abbey during the war.  I think it shows how life in England didn't change much at first early in the war, but effected everybody and strongly by the end.  Even the Abbey itself.  This season was as good as the 1st, and I quickly had to get the 3rd season to get my fix.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|As of the time of me writing this review, I have to say that this is the best Vita game.<br /><br />If you are not into JRPG games you probably will not be a fan, but if you are this game is great. As with all persona games you have the great demons and fusion mechanics as well as the social links. Which I consider to be like a dating sim game.<br /><br />A dungeon crawling game/ dating sim, if that doesn't sound enticing I don't know what does.<br /><br />If you own a PS Vita this game is a must have.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Only watched the first few episodes of this season so far, but it is as good as the other 2.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I found this way of eating to be easy because basically you can eat plenty of food. I did not lose a lot of weight because I ate lots of fruit, but I did feel better and lost five pounds in the month. The hardest part was parties where there was a lot of food you could not eat. My daughter rescued me with with fruit kabobs.

B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I enjoy watching science fiction movies. this one has a story line. I found this movie both entertaining and fun. It had good character buildup and did all of this with the fun of science fiction. It was also nice not to have anything I found to be offensive in the movie.

B00A0R0CG0|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers***<br /><br />\\"Ice Age 4 - Continental Drift\\" (hereafter IA4) is an ideal example of what I like to call \\"Cinematic Dissonance\\".  I define Cinematic Dissonance as the sensation when, watching a movie, your brain is telling you \\"This is really silly and/or stupid!\\" but your emotions are telling you \\"I'm having a great time!\\".  Therefore, I can understand and even somewhat agree with the 1- and 2-star reviewers of this movie who complain that IA4 is basically more of the hackneyed, predictable, improbable, and homogenized capers of Manny the Mammoth (Ray Romano) and company.  And yet, I side with the 3- and 4-star reviewers who enjoyed IA4 as an energetic, dynamic, funny seagoing adventure with allusions to Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" that somehow still reinforces the themes of family, adolescent angst, loyalty, self-sacrifice, and home.<br /><br />  With each succeeding \\"Ice Age\\" movie, logic and natural reality have been left further and further behind.  For example, by now, to appreciate the franchise, you have to accept that Scrat the obsessed saber-toothed squirrel's acorn pursuit will lead to more and more global catastrophic changes.  In IA4, he has caused the surprisingly fragile Pangea's fragmentation into the continents we know today.  We also have to accept that Manny is obstinately determined to keep his now-teenaged daughter Peaches (Keke Palmer) safe, when actually male elephants hardly take part in raising offspring, and that Peaches' best friend is a mole/hedgehog (\\"molehog\\") hybrid named Louis.  Of course, Peaches has also inherited her prehensile tail and tree-living abilities from her mother, Ellie (Queen Latifah).  The only other complication in our gang's essentially stable lives is the sudden abandonment of feisty Granny Sloth (Wanda Sykes) to Sid's (John Leguizamo's) care by his fly-by-night family.  Granny has a friend called \\"Precious\\", but it's certainly not a ring.  Hey, these are familiar domestic dramas, but IA4 still makes them interesting.<br /><br />  But the continental shiftings and movements interrupt the drama and gradually separate Manny, Sid, Granny, and Diego the sensible sabertooth cat (Denis Leary) from the others.  Set adrift on an iceberg, Manny and friends encounter another iceberg - a \\"pirate ship\\" commanded by a Gigantopithecus (according to Wikipedia) named Captain Gutt (Peter Dinklage) and his zoo crew - including a blubbery elephant seal, a rabbit, a kangaroo, and an able-bodied first-mate female Smilodon named Shira.  So now the plot is established with several resolutions to be made: 1) Can Manny and his crew escape Captain Gutt's grasp? 2) Will Shira mutiny and change alliances? 3) Can Manny and his crew weather turbulent seas, fierce narwhals, and even (!) sirens to get back home, AND save a kidnapped Peaches and Ellie?, 4) Can Manny defeat Captain Gutt in battle? 5) Can klutzy Sid get along with his grandma and be a hero, 6) Can insecure Louis help save his friends, and finally 6) Is Precious real, or just Granny's hallucination? Oohwee!<br /><br />  I think you know how all the above resolutions will play out.  Even so, I enjoyed them because I felt that all of IA4's characters were cheerfully giving their utmost to entertain us and having a grand time doing so.  Besides the vivacious characterizations, IA4 continues the breathtakingly solid and weighty photorealism of its backgrounds and animation.  Most importantly, IA4 continues to resist the self-consciousness of acting in a madcap, surreal story.  The characters believed in the story and told it well, and made me believe it, too.<br /><br />P.S.:  One other resolution - Scrat finds a treasure map that leads him to a legendary acorn paradise called \\"Scratlantis\\".  Does Scrat find the acorn of his dreams?  Wellll,.....<br /><br />P.P.S.:  By the way, Gigantopithecuses really did exist about 1 million years ago.  They were huge apes over 10 feet tall.  Therefore, it is quite plausible that Captain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny.tain Gutt could fight and even toss around Manny.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I played this till I got through all the levels.  They keep adding missions to keep the game challenging and interesting.<br /><br />You don't need to buy anything with real money.  Many of the purchases are just eye-candy, and not used much in accomplishing the mission.  You collect enough virtual money just by playing.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|While there are a lot of 70s-90s pop culture references I didn't entirely register, the concept of the book and the plot was deeply entertaining.  Would recommend to anyone with an imagination!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is easy and quick to use.  Not for fine edges on expensive knives (use an oil stone for that),  but good for quickly putting a decent edge on a medium quality blade
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|If you are looking for a lively beat and a distinct enjoyably sound, give this a try. I enjoy all the songs in the album and I look forward to her next one.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|After an hour of play,  I stopped using this.  I have other puzzle games that I've enjoyed playing for 20 hours or more,  this wasn't one of them.  Maybe just my taste.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I definitely get my 99¢ worth and then some.  This story was so well written and it had me thinking about it when I couldn't actually be reading it.  I got so lost in Sky's life and was so engrossed in every chapter' that I had a hard time putting it down.  I am a 39 yr old mom of 2 girls and never expected to enjoy a book about 2 teenagers.  But this book was so much more.  I encourage any woman of any age that has feelings, to read this book!
B008458O3S|2.0|I've owned 3 other similar games.  And this one seemed the least interesting, and I played it for less time than the others.
B00932A4XE|4.0|cute movie with lots of funny moments.  Enjoyed watching this with the girls. Recommend it for a girls night in.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I could not put it down. There is autism in the family so I found it helpful to know that when you have an understanding of how different personalities work together to achieve a fulfilled life, you can live in a peaceful and happy environment.
B00358ESI4|5.0|This movie is one of our favorites. A great movie with lots of action and great acting. We've watched it many times and always enjoy it.
B000OXHRRC|5.0|Delightful movie.  I have seen the movie several times but will watch it again.  A great movie to watch for a girls night out with a little wine.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|The kids will spend lots of time playing the game - challenges them to find the correct path without saying you did it wrong.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written, powerful and uplifting in every sense. A+ for Mr. Sparks on this one. Next?
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I used to wear these in the studio back in the early 90's. I have been wearing the Sony V-900's since about 97 but on a whim decided to try these again. Love them!
B003U4UPHG|5.0|They all are gonna die you me and them were all going to die just not everyone in this season
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Such compelling suspense and humor. I read this book some time ago and will reread it because I like John Corey so much and find the wit and suspense compelling.
1611761565|5.0|This book was interesting, giving factual information that has all the details, shows the real life of a Navy Seal.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Don't feel the story was realistic enough to stay with.  Too much football and not enough story. I don't really recommend this book.
1600242197|5.0|Very enlightening into Navy seal training and operations, keeps you involved and wanting to keep listening to book, real life means more.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Not John Grisham's best but close to it. I much prefer John Grisham''s involved lawyer stories.  Thsy have much more meat in them. i also liked Playing for Pizza and The Painted House better.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|It's a cute game and I enjoy playing it my only complaint is I wish I could have more `energy` so I could play longer
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Great, thought provoking, lyrics that can be enjoyed by all people; a sound that can capture the listener's heart and keep them motivated for more.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is super fun, you have some crazy guy chasing you trying to nab you. The hover boards are cool too, you can ride the wires too. I really enjoy this game.
B004YEJGEO|4.0|I have played this before. it is a great strategy game. it will not work on my galaxy s 3.
B0033806MI|5.0|It really fills inn the gaps you might be wondering about. Awesome short stories, you just want more and more!
0894803123|4.0|I love Ben and Jerry's ice cream and when my friend showed me this book, I knew I had to get it. I've only tried one recipe so far (Heath Bar Crunch) but I plan to work my way through eventually (not too fast or I'll gain too much weight). This isn't really a guide to duplicating all of their marketed flavors, but there are a few recipes for flavors that are currently in the graveyard (Dastardly Mash) that were there before I ever heard of B&J, so I'm glad I'll get to try them. The book is from the 1970s so recent flavors aren't in there, but there are also flavors in there that they tried but didn't really sell or couldn't figure out how to do in a large enough quantity.<br /><br />Also, because it's from the 70's, before salmonella from eggs became a huge worry, all the recipes call for whole raw eggs and don't involve any cooking. I'd either get pasteurized eggs (not sure where to get them; turns out Egg Beaters has onion powder and salt added to it, so it's not just pure pasteurized egg. Yuck!) or use a cooked custard method to cook the eggs and milk together, then chill before using the ice cream maker. Frozen custard has a pretty nice texture so it shouldn't hurt. :) You just have to make sure to do it over a double boiler and whisk constantly to keep it from curdling, then strain it through a strainer and/or cheesecloth to keep any curdles out of your finished product.<br /><br />I would love an updated edition with some new recipes, maybe for some of their more recent flavors, but if you never got to try Dastardly Mash or want to make your own Cherry Garcia, check it out for sure.
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I love all the Percy Jackson books! Read them twice now, including Heroes of Olympus! Read the book, before the movie. They are not even comparable!
B00APUU7S0|1.0|Trying to launch a new guy on Bruce Willis's back. Not Bruce's finest moment but I did watch the whole movie. Oh well.
B0058VW36U|3.0|I bought this to help entertain my grandchildren while visiting.  They seemed to enjoy the game at all the levels.
B00BHU261S|5.0|Excellent movie! High production values, excellent acting, and above-average screenwriting propels this story of the collaborative union between Alfred and Alma Hitchcock before and during the filming of Psycho, his most lucrative movie. The special effects, along with the extraordinary acting talents from master thespian Anthony Hopkins, convinced me I was watching Alfred Hitchcock once again speak to me through my television with his famous &#34;Good Evening&#34;.<br />Of course, Helen Mirren, who is every bit Anthony Hopkins equal in the acting arena, delivers one of here most amazing performances.<br />I know this isn't much of a review upon which to form an opinion about whether or not to watch this movie. I wasn't too excited about viewing it either going into it....I hadn't even heard of this picture, but I'm sure glad I did take the time to watch it, because it was worth every nickel I spent to see it and it provided me with what every successful movie I give a thumb's up to with...almost two hours of pure escapist entertainment.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|but thought otherwise.  They did such a good job updating the characters that I didn't long for the old cast.  There were plenty of comparisons and all good.  Will always love the first Footloose (I mean, who from that generation doesn't?), and will recommend the second,
B008Y212PI|5.0|great time passer<br />keeps my arithmetic skills sharp.<br />the number of hints gives a clue to how hard the puzzle is.
B0084670FU|2.0|We had 3 life stories that occasionally intersected and I was waiting for some kind of meaningful conclusion which, in my opinion, never came.  Or maybe I didn't get it.  I read where this was Pitt's best performance but I disagree.  I think it was his worst.  I liked him in Inglorious Basterds much much better.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Interesting story full of humor. This may be Tarantino's best movie! High level of violence, but to be expected from Tarantino.
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Very much enjoyed the story, but was disappointed that we could not allow the kids to see this. Several instances of inappropriate behaviors and language. Overall, I enjoyed it a lot. Love his crooked neck!
B0058BI896|5.0|My husband and I started watching the reruns of this show after a TBS marathon.  We were busy working in the kitchen and caught several episodes and could not believe how hysterical this show was.  We ended up renting all the back seasons and loved every episode.  The writing and directing is superb and the actors commit so well to their characters that you become engrossed in the show and forget you are watching a TV show.  It can be a little 'blue'... so it is not for young children.  Try it... you will love it.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|Entertaining, good action, good cast. Not too cheesy like some other previous MIs. My wife and I both enjoyed it.
B003UAHIM0|4.0|Not Mell Brooks best, but funny nonetheless. Kids 11+ will think it is great. Many jokes will go over their heads and will not get many of the references.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Are you captivated by page after page of repetitious and adverbial sword slashing? In love with shallow--at best one dimensional, characters?<br /><br />If so, &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; is for you!!<br /><br />Even the predictable births in the final pages aren't enough to tempt me towards volume two.<br /><br />Drek.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun game. If you like fish or building simulation games,  try it out. You do not have to sink a lot of money into playing like other,  simulacra games.
B008KOMMTA|5.0|Ok, so I'll admit, this isn't my only copy of the movie. This bundle is well worth any Titanic fan. I have several other bundles from VHS and DVDs as well. This is better than them ALL in my opinion. Well put together and the box design is perfect.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The attorneys, judges, cases and courtrooms keep me wanting to continue on with each episode, non-stop.  Love the top-notch script and actors!  Totally enjoyable series!
B00BR0SEAK|4.0|I have listened to \\"Now What\\" twice, all the way through. I can tell its one of those recordings that will get better with repeated playings. Like a good wine, or a good dish of Pasta that always tastes better after it sits a day or two in the fridge. To Me this is a much better CD than the last one. I enjoyed Rapture of the Deep, but it was too mellow in places. The sound on this recording is just so good. Ian Gillan is still a very good singer. Especially if He gets a break from the endless touring. When his vocal chords get a little rest, He can still sing wonderfully. They really do tour a little too much and His voice shows it on the end of tours and the end of their 1hour 45 minute sets. No one likes to admit the facts of aging I guess. There is still great talent there, but you have to rest a little more when you get older. Anyways, I digress. Every song is strong. Very melodic with the usual top notch muscianship and some fun lyrics. I loved the Vincent Price Song. Especially as I am a big fan of that great actor and master of the horror movie. Ian Gillan has a personal link with Vincent Price and its a fun story if you look it up. If I had to pick a favorite song it would be \\"apres Vous\\", just some fantastic guitar/organ work in tandem. Don Airey is inspired on this recording. The spirit of the truly great Man Jon Lord must have been in the Studio. The Hammond Organ was what distinguished Deep Purple from many other heavy rock outfits, and that tradition is being honored by Don. I like every song. If you are a deep purple fan, this is another good offering from them. And if you are just a lover of good solid hard Rock, you will like this record too. I notice that people are so super critical these days. Like they expect it to be a Religious experience when a new record comes out from one of the Old classic bands. My advice is be glad that these bands are still viable and are putting out very good music still. Some of the gushing over the 70's is from peoplewho are waxing nostalgic about their youth and the sound tracks that accompanied their younger days. In some ways the newer music is actually better in some areas. Its amazing that its 45 years that Deep Purple has been around in one form or another. The mark 2 is the best line up. But this line up not lagging too far behind. Buy it and enjoy it. Life is hard and short folks.  Richard.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I am amazed at Adele's talent and had to buy this CD.  Her music is some of the best and what a gifted singer she is.  Can't wait to see what she does next.
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|I'm writing this review as I watch this film. The movie is interesting, no doubt about that, but it is way long and drawn out in the beginning. The best part is the last part of the movie: the ending and last hour: It is at this time when the film actually gets started. Actress Jessica Chastain as Maya does an excellent job as the CIA analyst that locates Bin Laden. This film does a fantastic job of showing what AMericans' had to to do find the mass murderer Bin Laden and the political red tape that protectors of this country has to go through to get anything done, even going after Osama Bin Laden.<br />Overall, this is a worthwhile film to watch at least once. Just don't expect a lot of action until the ending.
B000002572|5.0|I have loved the band Boston since 1974! I have bought this cd several times before but had lost ( or my sons stole them!) so I had to get it again! I can load 6 CDs in my car and listen to my music all the time!! I think the 70's & 80's had some of the best metal/rock music of all time!
B0013TTK9E|5.0|Again if you are an Austen fan you will love this and any of her diary re-telling books. I enjoyed it emensley!
0451228731|3.0|It was ok. Some parts were slow and some of the ideas were a little cheesy, but on the other side of the spectrum there were some really interesting concepts and ideas based on reality. I'd consider reading the next book.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I thought the book was interesting and fun to read. Would read notebooks by this author. Random words the end
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I had to listen to the samples prior to purchasing on Amazon.  I immediately bought this CD and listen to it while working out on the treadmill.  Upbeat music that makes we want to move.  Heard &#34;When I Was Your Man&#34; on a TV appearance and had to buy it for that song alone but am not disappointed as the entire CD is loaded with GREAT music.  If you like Bruno Mars you are going to love, love, love this CD.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but only wish the story line was more sensitive to the nature of additction....Though it is probably portrayed closer to reality!<br /><br />Question?  Is it possible to fly a plane inverted?
B0094M2SCI|5.0|This is by far the best vampire movie I have ever seen. It is intense throughout the entire movie action all the way!!!
B000MAH5O2|3.0|I'm reading his book half way through his Presidency and find it very disturbing that this person is just misleading. Or maybe he can't remember what he wrote when he was in the Senate. Or maybe it is Bish's fault. I'm glad he was able to pass Obama care  (never mind his misrepresentation about no  increase in premiums) because reading his book isn't good for my blood pressure.
B000002AGN|5.0|I am assuming most people reading this are already familiar with the music on this CD but if you are not, it's one of the cornerstones of any good music collection and you should stop reading this review and buy it.  The liner notes are excellent in giving an overview of the historical imortance of the album.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric's voice is still great! Highly recommend! I saw him in concert back in sixties and he was drunk as cooter brown. This time he sounds pretty much sober and on his game.
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Great CD with so much of Bruno's fabulous talent.  An amazing artist who is truly gifted.  Also bough Unorthodox Jukebox and WOW, not one bad song on the CD.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I'm not sure why but I can watch this movie over and over again, with or without my girlfriend. Recommended to all.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|good read.  very different approach in telling the story.it was a great book for  our Book Club to read together.
B004WOH19S|3.0|Typically a Jeffery Archer novel, but long, too short in some parts and with no end. Not his best novel
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I enjoy the game, i refuse to spend a ton of money on 'hearts' so I am limited but it's still a fun diversion.
B00BLYFDO2|4.0|Face it, since Idiot & Lust, Iggy's good albums can be counted on 2 fingers: New Values and American Caesar. Okay, to be fair cases can made be made for the loony likes of Soldier and Zombie Birdhouse but most have suffered from being too \\"Pop\\" or \\"Metal\\". At best self-conscious, at worst cliched. As far as \\" Stooges\\" reunions go, The Weirdness was just as dull as anything he cut since Naughty Little Doggie.<br /><br />Suddenly at the ripe age of 66 comes his best in years. Is it a mind blowing masterpiece of unparalleled proportions? No. It's the sound of a bunch of grouchy, dirty old men sitting on their front porch, spitting tobacco at \\"kids today\\".<br /><br />After falling out over the production of 1980's Soldier, Raw Power's James Williamson is back and he makes a huge difference. He may have been VP of Tech Standards at Sony all these years but man does he still have his chops. As a collaborator and musical foil, he's everything Iggy's been missing in the last 35 years.<br /><br />Clocking in at 35 minutes, something is to be said for \\"less is more\\". \\"Burn\\" is a vigorous kick off. Though like the album cover, any allusions to terrorist bombings suffer from poor timing. Lyrically, \\"Sex & Money\\" and \\"Job\\" are half assed and nothing new, but something musically is happening here that propels. Namely James Williamson.<br /><br /> \\"Unfriendly World\\" unexpectedly dips into ballad territory and wisely never loses site of a hook or a poignant one liner. The title track is the best thing on here and \\"Beat That Guy\\" has that New Values' sense of wit.  On the other hand, the horn driven \\"DD's\\" is shamelessly puerile, worshiping at the twin altars of Jane Mansfield and milking 'em for all its worth. If there's a thin line between locker room humor and creepiness, leave it to Iggy to find it. \\"Departed\\" ends it all on a subdued but strikingly elegiac note with lines like \\"Yesterday's a door that's opening for the departed\\" and \\"at the end of the game we all get thrown under the bus\\".<br /><br />So no surprise, this is no Raw Power or Fun House. But it's no Weirdness either. Truth is, its not much of a departure from his usual formula but thanks to Williamson, a cut above the rest. The grumpy sound of not going gently into that Goodnight. And since my expectations were pretty low to begin with, am pleasantly surprised.er the bus\\".<br /><br />So no surprise, this is no Raw Power or Fun House. But it's no Weirdness either.

074356829X|2.0|I agree with all the other reviewers, this book is simply awful. I was hoping that listening to it in the car in the audio book version would help, but it didn't. Even the person reading it sounds annoyed at times over the story. At first I thought, maybe the author approaches the cliches with a tongue in cheek, and it is meant to be fun and a little sarcastic, but it is not. What do we have?<br />1. a vain, beautiful girl who fears beauty won't last forever and is a serial dater<br />2. a girl with the perfect life, who is annoyed by her perfect boyfriends who then proposes to her<br />3. the girl we all know with the unhealthy relationship who gets dumped and then reinvents herself in her job.<br />I have heard it all, and I don't need any more of it.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|This product didn't last too long. Was not able to return it because the first drop was not until a few weeks later. Nonetheless, girlfriend dropped her phone twice, case cracked each time. Still aesthetically pleasing, but no longer waterproof. Phone didn't crack so i'll give the case that much.
B001EBWING|4.0|Although the movie does not necessarily plumb the issues fully, it has a great range of human experience -- love gained and lost, friendship, and living with (or without) principles. The story has that compelling feeling that nothing extra is in the film. One aspect I noticed with this most recent viewing is the interesting subtleties. For example, the love develops between the two leads, Bogart and Bergman, takes place in Paris without them truly knowing each other. Meanwhile, Paul Henreid loves Ingrid Bergman but not, apparently, vice versa. The word \\"love\\" can mean many things, and several of them are explored here. The film is full of the messiness of every day life and real relationships and world politics, with ambiguity and yet ultimately a sense that something has been accomplished, that some clarity has appeared.

0307477401|3.0|No question that Mankell is an excellent writer, but I ended this feeling disappointed. The mystery was intriguing, but for me it left too many unanswered questions. Wallander's misery and depression did seem, as he himself described it, pathetic. I would like to have seen him at least acknowledge the good he'd done, even if life was slipping away from him. Not the finish I'd hoped for.
B00BS4PAXO|5.0|Can't stop listening to this album!! Awesome! Current, church ready music that we are putting right into our Sunday lists!
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Great book. I enjoyed the twists & turns the story took. Good descriptions<br />of Paris & French food. Characters were believable. Look forward to reading more Maggie Newberry Mysteries!

B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Downloaded for my son. He loves it. I have observed that the graphics are very good. Kids seem to like it a lot
0385737955|3.0|I overall liked this book, But it took some contemplation over how i felt about it after I had read it. The book starts out really strong, very interesting. I had read a'lot of the reviews before purchasing this books so I knew there would be trouble soon as 'the girl' appears. And they are absolutely right. A very interesting setting unravels with awkward character development or lack of it whens he shows up, missing out on a lot of opportunity. Some of the aspects don t make sense, and there are some deux ex machinas present. Towards the end of the book I was becoming frustrated with some of the cheesy poor plot when it had been going so well.<br /><br />Then you get to the ending ??????????<br />When you get through it, you can 'kind of' understand how things were handled how they were towards the end. Did it make for a great book? Ehh, i think there were some changes that would have engaged readers and be less annoying. And the ending itself is very jarring and nonsensical. I don't think it can be judged properly until reading the next book, to get some sort of context. It leaves you hanging, but in an awkward way.<br /><br />But it was still enough for me to buy the next book, and i don't regret reading this one. Perhaps after the second book i'll have a better grasp as to why some of the literary choices were made. Overall, pick it up if only for the first portion. The book leaves you with many more questions then answers, which may not be a bad thing.
030726999X|5.0|Read it in two days.  A book that came highly recommended to me so I bought it for my niece, had to read it first.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|This was an excellent movie.  It is hard to watch some parts but it is a true story and it was well done.  Heartwarming as well.
B008XG1X18|2.0|Fantastic app, but some reason the last 2 weeks it wont respond and my kindle keeps saying to &quot;force close&quot;. I've reinstalled the app and no change. I love pinterest, but this app is buggy.
B003B5M0PO|2.0|I started to read this book but did'nt find it the sort of book that interested me, and therefore I did'nt complete reading it. I really only acquired it because my wife is interested in horses.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|I personally loved the movie but I think it was more scary than a PG.  I wouldn't show it to kids under 13
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I really loved this book. It was the perfect time to read this book. I enjoyed every word during the whole book.
0399162097|4.0|There's a twist in Karen Joy Fowler's new novel, but you probably already know about it. The cover copy gives it away, and I imagine most reviews will too. This one certainly will, in the next paragraph, because you can't really discuss the book without doing so. But if by some miracle you don't know already, you might want to read WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES before you find out. If so, let me just say that it's definitely a novel I recommend, funny and well-observed and briskly paced. The ending may be a little too upbeat and consoling, but Fowler arranges things carefully so the consolation doesn't cloy and the whiff of middlebrow sentimentality never becomes more than a whiff. There are a lot of books out there about middle-class dysfunction, and despite its novel conceit this one doesn't break new thematic ground, but its small insights and crisp prose make it worth reading all the same.<br /><br />Rosemary Cooke's life changed forever when she was five and her sister Fern disappeared. In the aftermath of that loss, the family splintered, and older brother Lowell eventually ran away from home. So far so typical-- it might be the ORDINARY PEOPLE of the early 21st century- but here's the thing: Fern was a chimpanzee, brought into the Cooke home as part of a scientific experiment. The fact that she was no less a sister to Rosemary, and her absence no less devastating, suggests the central issue of WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES, namely the thinness of the differences between human beings and animals, and the moral consequences of that thinness for animal experimentation. That makes the book sound heavy, but it isn't. Indeed, the disappointing thing about the novel is that it pulls its punches just a bit, taking a triangulating position neither the author nor the narrator really seems likely to believe in. At one point, Rosemary writes, \\"Nobody's arguing these issues are easy.\\" That may be true, but I don't think she, or Fowler, would argue that they're particularly hard either, except for the sake of an ersatz literary notion of balance. By the same token, the ending backs away from the darker tone of the middle, giving off an anodyne \\"time heals most wounds\\" air. Of course time does, but the evocation of Rosemary's despair and social alienation is so quietly powerful that its abrupt resolution feels contrived rather than earned. There is, however, enough left realistically unresolved or tragic that the dissatisfaction doesn't become pervasive.<br /><br />Fowler has that essential gift of the social novelist: the ability to create moments that capture the common experiences of familial function and dysfunction but are specific enough not to feel like trite or cliched emotional manipulation. She also demonstrates a remarkable capacity to think out the various consequences for all concerned of raising a chimpanzee and a human as twin sisters, from the unique sibling rivalry that arises to Rosemary's eventual difficulties bonding with human children. The narrative is tightly structured so that each turn of events works simultaneously as a logical outgrowth of what has preceded it and as part of a web of themes and motifs that also brings in human and chimpanzee gender roles and the nature of memory. Witty asides enhance the rhythm of the clockwork plot, as when Rosemary remembers a radio talk show caller who complained about being forced to read DRACULA and adds \\"(Let's just pause here for a moment to imagine how a person who felt imposed on by vampires back in 1979 feels today. And then, right back to my story.)\\" Given its ambitions, WE ARE ALL COMPLETELY BESIDE OURSELVES could scarcely be a better-written book than it is. I do wish it wanted to push its readers a little more, but hey, you can't have everything.hey're particularly hard either, except for the sake of an ersatz literary notion of balance.

B0063M22QO|4.0|I had played Mahjong before and I really like the game.  I think it is good for one's mind. I
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this for my kindle fire because the charger I got with it stopped working. I used this to charge my kindle on my computer which worked fine but it took forever! I should have read more about it. But you can use it to transfer stuff from your computer to the kindle. It is long, which is a huge plus. I am going to have to buy the separate wall adapter to use with this cable. Other than that, great product!
B0042JTDXK|3.0|I would not recommend to anyone.  He needs to get back to the sounds that made him popular in the first place.  This is not it.  Won't buy another Groban cd for just one song on there that I like.
8866134627|5.0|So if any of you had been using Penultimate on the iPad and were pissed when they updated it and &#34;broke&#34; it after Evernote bought them, this is the replacement for you. I used Penultimate for three years at work ...no more. Sell your iPad for it's residual value on Amazon and buy this and use the difference for beer money.  Can annotate photos.  No limits with cut and paste.  Battery life is excellent.  Any stylus will work, although I recommend a very fine tip mechanical pencil.  The page turning effect and paper textures are so real!  Weighs less than an iPad.  Ask your coworkers how green their electronics are! (which are landfill-bound unless they are specifically recycled, and even then tablets are difficult to open and separate).
B004DLPXAO|1.0|cannot navigate the CalorieKing Carb book ((Kindle edition) 2013) with the recent update 4.0.1.3.  This pertains to smartphones running the goggle android system.  Was able to look up items under the old version logically.  With the update the book is worthless when your trying to count carb in order to determine the amount of insulin you need to take to control your diabetes.
0439023513|5.0|A great ending to a fascinating story.  Begin with The Hunger Games.  Read it even if you've seen the movie.  As with most books, it's better than the movie.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|This movie was okay.  Jamie Foxx was good.  I thought it was a little more violent than I care for.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|my daughter loves this, nice that it has followup activiies and not just one for each letter.  My 2.5 year old plays it more than my 4.5 year old, but they both enjoy it.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Every song on here is beautiful.  But, I would have bought it just for Il Nostro Incontro and A Mano A Mano, they are superb.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I needed to read the book before seeing the movie. It was wonderful as well as the movie and understood why certain things were left out.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Try to stop.... you can't.....can you!  Love the challange.  I use this game to come down after a really busy day.<br />I have to admit it's very hard to stop playing ......I could play all day.  See if you can stop......
0439023491|5.0|This is the second book of the trilogy and it runs right into the third.  So plan on reading them all.  I saw The Hunger Games movie between books one and two.  Seeing the movie helps place a face on the characters in the book.  Books tend to be better than the movies but I still can't wait to see Catching Fire, the movie, when it comes out in November 2013.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great game but wondering when amazon will release the 1.2 update? I keep getting notifications from the game to download the 1.2 update. Please release it soon. Can't wait!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Start to finish, this album sounds great! Marvelous organically layered sounds, and thank God less rap on this album. Timberlake does not need guest rappers, it serves only as a distraction - to boost sales - and it diminishes the quality of his own sound. Suit & Tie is amazing, perfect pop, then JayZ comes in and well, I'm counting the seconds till he's done with his bit and Timberlake comes back in to save the song. All in all, it seems Timberlake is moving into richer textures and more mature sounds. I hope this marks the beginning of a creative spurt for him, and the end of guest rappers all together. Great voices like his don't need distractions.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|After this movie and The Hurt Locker, I'm having a hard time getting my mind wrapped around why Bigelow gets under my skin (that's a compliment) with her no-nonsense approach.  My best guess is that it's her use of restraint.<br /><br />She's documentary-style, but restrains herself from shaking the crap out of the camera.  She shows violence matter-of-factly, sometimes in-your-face, but restrains herself from sensationalizing it.  She builds suspense, but she doesn't compromise a certain calmness and naturalness to do so.  Her sparse use of music (less sparse here than in Hurt Locker, but still the opposite end of the spectrum from, say, The Dark Knight Rises' bombastic score) and emotion are effective, too.  In short, there are tons of quiet choices that impress me, places where I so expected her to milk something for all it was worth but she never did.  And yet she didn't use quiet in that super-jarring way that keeps any rhythm from forming.  You see, it's really hard for me to figure out what she's doing that I like so much, but this has been as close as I've gotten.<br /><br />I think maybe she's borrowed (another compliment) some style points from Soderbergh, but definitely has her own voice. I'm really glad she's making films.  I don't think she's an absolute master yet (as in top 25 director of all time), but boy did she come close with this one.  I think her film beat Argo all to hell, and I'm a big fan of Ben Affleck's directing, too.<br /><br />I did think there was a spot in the middle where my concentration was tested by the pacing, but I can't give it less than 5 stars just because the strong parts were so very strong.  If great film-making were more common, maybe I could dock it a little, but it isn't.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Great condition.  FABULOUS price!!!! Will definitely order more movies.  so nice to find a place<br />where you can get kids movies cheap.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is super fun to play, it's a lot like Sim City or Megapolis so if you like those games you will like this. There's a lot you can do without buying anything with real money so that is nice. ENJOY!
B00004RFFI|5.0|Pardon me while I just inhale nostalgia.  I can still recall 1996, being at the house of a friend whose parents had rented Twister on [guffaw!] video cassette.  Both of us were allowed to watch it unsupervised.  And trust me: being 10 years old and living in a rather less sophisticated portion of Tennessee, and able to watch a PG-13 movie which was populated purely by adults who were coping with life-and-death situations instead of children/adolescents surviving the travails of middle/high school, made one feel pretty badass.  (I know I wasn't the only 10-year-old in 1996 so I'm sure those people know *exactly* what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />No, it's not a good movie.  Yes, it's moronic and cartoonish.  Unfortunately, my memory informs my appreciation of this movie, and since the world of the 10-year-old tends to be small, and since the household in which I was then living was particularly restrictive, this Van-Halen-blaring expletive-sprinkled effects-laden crowd-pleasing clunker seemed the pinnacle of sophistication.  Of course now I know better, and in a way it's shaming to not only have it in the repertoire of the culture of my childhood but to also yearn for that provincial/unpolitical/lower-class existence of which this simple pleasure was a part, and which it perhaps helped to enforce.<br /><br />Still, knowing better doesn't entirely prevent one from self-indulgence, which I've clearly done throughout this review.  And it was the '90s!!!!
B000BW7QX6|5.0|I love the Serenity series, I bought a set for my Brown Coat son too.<br />bs five more words required
B004H4XI5O|5.0|Loved this book. could not put it down.  well written and style is very easygoing and fun. Learned alot about memory with a fun story along with it. Originally saw this book with writer on a tv show. The book was way better than I expected. Even if you don't want to memorize it is an educational and fun story.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Very good! The movie is very intense.  Hard to believe its a true story.  Would recommend to my friends Great
B009RI4ZKC|1.0|It put my wife to sleep also, and it will put you to sleep too because it is totally pointless.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Easy to use and fresh layouts. I am very pleased. Finding new blogs is easy and unfollowing a blog actually works.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is a must read.  I discovered Colleen Hoover and her book Hopeless and so I decided to try others by her.  This book will not disappoint!  I love all the characters and the story line. It had me reeled in after the first page.  This book also made me cry.  I have never cried before but I was so into it I cried.... twice.  I tell everyone I can to read anything and everything by this author.
B005FPT51K|4.0|I found this to be the most usable monitor since my wife and I have iPhones and an iPad to be able to use as monitor screens and speakers paired to the camera when I first bought it. Setup was not as easy as the marketing made it out to be, but I believe this to be due to when I bought it the software was still be hammered out.<br /><br />The first 2 months were hit and miss if the software would stay running over night or not which was not very helpful for my sleep schedule. After a few updates though, the iBaby is a wonderful monitor system. My only regret now is the sound it makes when the app is running and my battery on my iOS device is running low around 20% or less, it's very annoying to say the least and doesn't stop (a safety feature I'm sure).<br /><br />I have already recommended this monitor to several friends that are expecting and will continue to do so.
630587493X|5.0|This movie is one of a kind .. It states good morals of how each individual should act in life, with having the right perspectives and looking at things differently!!!! its such a GREAT movie to watch ... no regrets.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i can see and talk to my family and friends easier than going to big computer.the ease of it being there.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It is not what I expected . Not a easy read .Started out ok but then it was to messed to follow
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book, with wonderful characters. It is more of a YA book but it is so advanced an adult can read it and enjoy it just as much.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Catching up on the series. Can appreciate the characters and plot. But honestly, cut your losses sooner. You can't save everybody.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|It is a beautiful movie with lovely story. Wished I had watched this in a theater but HD would have to do for now.
B0026WNGBA|5.0|This is not the sort of book to read and sto on the bookshelf, but a reference manual for those who want to learn how to run more efficiently and prevent injuries.  In my case, I´m working with it and I have gone back to running, starting slowly to build up mileage, after two knee injuries.  However, I feel it may not be enough with the text, and either coaching or buddy help for refining your style is required.
B008XG1X18|5.0|you can find anything you want and it is ready when you are.it is great! can not wait to get back on it.
B00CHILW64|4.0|Was entertaining to watch. Keeps you on your toes. Bloody scenes were difficult to watch. Overall, recommended if you feel like watching drama
B0042J6VUS|4.0|Good little tripod made of metal. I use it for a lot of little projects for school and work. It works great with my iPhone 5.
B002QYSZBO|3.0|I was really getting into this movie but thought the last 20 minutes were a letdown.  Wonderful acting by Val Kilmer and Doeny though.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is a pretty amazing soundtrack. I think they may have taken it straight from the movie because of the background noises in some of the songs.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Not much to keep my interest here.....and I love historical films.  Still trying to figure out why they gave an academy award to Daniel Day-Lewis.  He's an excellent & accomplished actor, but in this roll, he's just ok.  Not worthy of an oscar win, for sure.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|did not care for it to much like mario.like things better when it is search and find. sorry i did not care for it.
0882847953|5.0|Great book, lots of exercises to further your understanding of syncopation.  They become gradually more difficult as you proceed but move at a steady pace that is great for beginner/intermediate level players.
B004RKXN44|5.0|One of the best books in a fantastic series. Even after multiple re-reads, it is addictive each time I come back to it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Very well written, very captivating historical story telling. It is well worth every penny spent and then some. It is a very helpful, many faceted, view of this time in history. No angels, no demons, just humans carrying out their ambitions.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Excellent! Like seeing it in the theater again! I highly recommend it to those who loved it the first time! I have already watched it a few times. Very emotionally compelling.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I really enjoyed the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so I was anxiously awaiting this movie.  I tried watching it twice, but still couldn't make it to the end.  It was just so boring!  What a big disappointment.
B005H9B44A|5.0|I'm a huge Avengers/Marvel fan so I loved this movie! Great action scenes, good dialogue and absolutely loved Loki as the villain.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|If The book can be considered a tapestry, then the movie is a symphony.<br /><br />Here are more words to keep the count above 20.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I like this better than the first, although there are to many, many, many, many, many sex scenes, there's still a good story.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|This artist is just incredible, every song, every composition is just inspiring and take you to other places so you can feel calm.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Why is this movie broken up and you have to turn the DVD over to continue the movie. I was shocked that more effort wasn't put into getting this movie all on one side. Other than that, I love the movie!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|I enjoyed the first two seasons except for the tendency of the writer to kill or treat badly the really nice people in this story while sokmehow allowing others to do well.  The death of Mathew after the birth of their first child and heir in the last episode was all that I could take.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Basically a poor-written soap opera set in a post-apocalyptic era where children killing children is good sport. I am always puzzled why future humankind is presented by Hollywood as nothing but barbarians with mag-lift trains and flying cars.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I read Mr. Munro's review on 'Silver Linings Playbook' and had to laugh. There are always people like you in every review<br />category rather it be music, a book, or (in this case) a movie. My wife and I actually went on a date night to see this wonderful movie and she is not one for a movie that swears a lot or movies that are loud, she likes chick flicks. We also had to go out of out of town because the theaters were we live are prudish (as you seem to be) when it comes to movies dealing with reality.<br />Mental illness is a terrible issue on all levels but 'Silver Linings Playbook' took the chance to let the public know what people who suffer from these deceases have to go through. I love this movie because it's honest, direct to the point, and the acting was amazing. No, Bradley Cooper did not overact on any level in this movie. He played his part to the tee. Jennifer Laurence played her role just as well.<br />My only advice to Mr. Andrew I. Munro Sr, myself being completely blown away by his reaction to this great movie, is to wait for a good Walt Disney movie to come out to go out for a date night (did you see 'Wreck it Ralph'). You are definitely not mature enough to live in the 21st century. It seems a bit to real for you. O' by the way, what were the ratings on 'Silver linings Playbook' at the time of my response? That would be 156 good and appreciative reviews to what? 23 people like yourself. Stick to a G rating please.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This is one of the movies that I went the cinema to see. You could call it an anomaly amongst the other films I went to see (sinister for example). But I do like certain musicals though, so was willing to give it a look.  I enjoyed it from start to finish. Amazing, truly amazing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a is great calculator for everyone, but especially people who have a hard time seeing or pushing small buttons. I don't even have to hunt for the glasses to use it!! Highly recommended!
B001DHXT20|5.0|My grandson loved this movie version. He loves the Hulk. It is his favorite character. I'm sure he will continue to watch the movie many times over,
B008NMT684|5.0|My grandson just loves this app. it keeps him busy and in one place. Playing this app along with the others he has like this one is the only way I can get him to sit down and be quiet.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|The story was extremely cliche, but the music was amazing.  Cher is a classic and Christina's voice is such a powerhouse, you can feel every beat in your body.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|I just do not find it to be something I enjoy. The girl in my showing I suppose, oh well.
B004742Y68|4.0|The film is old, but you would never know it.  HD format really made this a Good film to watch.
B0097HSS4M|3.0|This is an O.K. photo editor, but it does not allow one to put the edited files into the directory that contained them in the first place.  One must hook up the USB cable to a Windows computer and manipulate them through it.  This may be a problem mor with Kindle than with the Photo Editor.
B002VWNID6|5.0|I saw this movie a few years ago.  I recently came across it and thought to myself I should purchase it.  I like some of Kevin Costner films.  There was another version of Robin Hood portrayed by another actor (I can't remember who), but I preferred Costner
B007N8RULO|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. I play it every day and again before I go to sleep. It keeps me so entertained and is very challenging.
6305078181|5.0|What can I say, a sexy Dracula is worth the time to ogle him anyday.  The movie came perfectly wrapped and I enjoyed it very much.
B00BHBBSZ2|5.0|This app is great for writing down notes throughout the day, or anytime. You write in your own handwriting and it is saved for you when you need it. You can delete, edit or do just about anything with this. And the price was right!!!
B00BUCXVPI|3.0|Having read all the books, I was disappointed on three specific points.  One, a 5 foot guy just can't project the physical menace of a 6'5\\" guy, no matter how well he fights.  Two, Jack Reacher does't drive well, so a typical Hollywood chase scene clanged for me.  And three, Reacher doesn't believe in \\"fair\\" fights, so the final fight scene had me whispering to myself, \\"That's not Reacher.\\"
B003IEJZUG|4.0|After several people recommended it, I am glad I read this book. It was Thought-provoking and interesting.  The first part is a bit dry and slow but the second part reads so quickly! The characters are well-developed and the book is truly fascinating to read. I would've given this five stars if part one wasn't so boring at times.
B005S9ELVC|5.0|This movie was all I expected it to be.  The cast was phenomenal.  I like all the actors.  I had to give it five stars.  I was remembering when I first noticed Gosling and it was in Remember the Titans with Denzel; now I have to purchase that, I was surprised at myself I didn't have it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|If you are looking for an easy, no thought, straight up fun read with lots of fake sex, this is it.  If you are actually into the BDSM Lifestyle, this will be a joke to you, but if you are just looking to spice up a little of your love life, or live vicariously through someone else's love live, this is a decent book.<br /><br />Be prepared for a relatively juvenile writing style, repetitious words and themes, and a kinky Cinderella-ish storyline.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Great movie for kids or adults. This is a must see. We watch it over and over again. Love it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|If you like you tube, this is a must.<br />Takes you everywhere on the site and makes it so easy to watch whatever you are looking for.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This movie doesn't quite live up to the hype, but overall I found it to be very enjoyable. The actors are all believable in their roles and make you feel very sympathetic to their situations. Bradley Cooper especially did a very good job portraying someone with Bipolar Disorder who is still struggling to find solid footing again after his diagnosis. The chemistry between him and Jennifer Lawrence is easy and sweet, and while the love story is nice it does not take over the whole movie and turn it into a mushy rom-com. I really liked it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on my toes all the way to the end. It was enjoyable and provoking. I couldn't decide who to root for the entire way through. She has created two likable yet despicable characters who ensnare you from the start.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|When the previews showed this movie I just knew I had to see it.  I usually do not go to the movies; I wait mainly until they come out on DVD.  My son said the movie was very good, but he also know I do not like a lot of the swearing in these movies these days.  I ordered and it wasn't as much but when I could not take the swearing I would turn the  volume down.  beside, from that I also thought the movie was excellent.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Terrible book.  But, I couldn't take my eyes off of the pages until I finished it.  I will say that I was tired of the female character's inner monologue, and I was ready for the fairytale to be over, but like the Energizer Bunny, it just seemed to keep going.  If you need to read it, rent it or borrow it.  You'll hate yourself for buying it.
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved it. Was like the walking dead, but with aliens. =) I can't wait for season 3! Everything about it was great.
B008MM9630|5.0|Got this game for me and my daughter to play and we love it. The graphics are nice and the background music is very soothing. Gardening without the sweat what fun!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is a great story line.  It has likable characters, suspense, and a tough problem to solve.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I'd like more detail, more back story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Lots of nice plot twists<br />And the clock arena and there no longer being a district 12 was a nice touch
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|Good fun movie. But not worth the price amazon charges. If they fix the prices I might rent again... but amazon prime is a rip off and I will go back to apple till its fixed
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Let me start by saying that if you are into the BDSM lifestyle, this book will probably just piss you off.  Don't get it.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the first book, and if you're like me and wanted to see what happens, then go ahead and get it.  Or, even better, rent it from the library and save yourself the money.  It continues it's poorly written, juvenile storyline, and yeah... that's about it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Could not put it down. It was so simple but I so enjoyed it.  Never really knew how it would end.  Have not seen the movie yet.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another good one from another favorite author.  Mitch Rapp series are very good and apparently Mr. Flynn has some very good sources and a great imagination.  Well worth the read.
1400049628|5.0|This book was very entertaining and I liked that it was a conversation starter whenever I was around someone with the book. I thought people might find me weird for reading it but moreso it was just comical. If you're in the mood for some serious-sounding fun then this is a great book for you. It would probably make a good gift for someone who's traveling and has a good sense of humor.
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Modern effects of a classic genre. Emma Stone and Sean Penn are excellent!  There were some parts of the movie that could have been more gripping, but good overall.
B000002GB6|5.0|I can say enough about Chuch Mangione's work. This is one of the best a albums I own. From slow to upbeat, it is on this album. If you don't have it, get it. If you have it, play it.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Classic story improved in the adaptation. Wonderful characters,  This is the second time I've seen it,  and it was even better.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|The book moved me to think about sales in a new light. Not only from my perspective but from the perspective of being sold to. Great read.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|As a fan of David Baldacci I consider this a must read.  The addition of a 'special' character made it that much more interesting.  Definitely another page turner.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great  play over and over!!!! Good strategy play and keeps you busy . Smashing good time, but do not hurt the natives.
B005IFWXWU|4.0|Just what I needed...now that House is over. He's great, luv the album!  Downloaded via amazon to my kindle fire & have been listening for a week now.
B004XISI4A|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better.  Hungry for the next book.<br />Short review, but if your reading this series there is nothing more to say.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I haven't read the book, and may not, however the selection of works to supposedly &#34;accompany&#34; the book are well thought out by the author, and excellent renditions of each choice.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this little app.  The selection of tunes to wake up to are pretty cool.  Very soothing to wake up to.  This app even has soothing sounds to go to speep to.
B009FZFONO|5.0|sweet.  this was a great series.  It the only show that you can watch someone die twice.  Great series.  cant wait for S-4
B000002I7H|2.0|This is my second order with this company on England. My first time I had to contact seller, after receiving only 1 cd out of 2 I ordered. If I had forgotten it, I don't think I would have received it. I called again & got it. This Oder is in the time period but has been over a month, & I still am waiting. This company is the longest wait for any third party seller & I have ordered other overseas companies. I will probably have to call again. No tracking number is provided by this company. You will wait a long time for your item. I would only use if no alternate. A low price is nice, but you will wait for it & may have to call Amazon to report a claim
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I bought this specifically for the excel function.  I was able to upload my workbook, but when I try to got to another worksheet the program shuts down.  Also, it does not let me doo certain formulas, like tracking time spent at a job, which is what I need.  I'm going to delete it and look for something better.  Also, there's really no instructions as to how to pull up the keyboard, I found it by chance.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This is a good book for a quick, easy read, would definitely make for a good beach read.<br /><br />It's written from the point of view of the main character who has just returned home after a stint in a mental hospital, where he required treatment for a mental breakdown after his wife leaves him. He speaks in that brutally honest way that children do, which allows for both heartache and some comedic relief. As he slowly starts to put his life together, he also begins to piece together the events in his life that have brought him to this place. All of this occurs while he is surrounded by his Eagles obsessed family, who are almost as dysfunctional as he is.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|A very moving, well-written story that explores a less well- known horror of the Holocaust. It leaves the reader with an understanding<br /> of why the world must never forget and why their stories must live on.
B003OUXECE|5.0|The book is wonderful.Great overall and many gamers and casual readers will like this book. Try reading just a sample first and if you like it, then buy it
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I spent the last week watching Season 3 - definitely watch it if you have seen the other seasons. It is a bit like a soap opera - you get hooked. It is nice that they add new characters and write some out too... more realistic.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|Menus and their so called features are not natural in the least, image is good whatever the movie. Only for Alien die hard fans.
034580404X|5.0|this was a great price on the 3 volume set. This is a very different sort of book than I usually read but it was a fast read as you always wanted to know what was going to happen next!
B00503BN1M|4.0|I liked they way they kept running into each other. These two actors should be in more movies with each other because they play off each other very well.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|From the beginning with Dwight Yoakum and then Bad to The Bone, you knew this movie was going to be a wild ride with lots of action and suspense. I have all (3) Terminator movies with Arnold and by far this is the best movie and never gets old and now with Blu-Ray it is even better.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|So<br />Well written. Sad and heartwarming, full of suspense and twists. Loooooved it! Can't wait to read the next book!
6305076995|5.0|...because anyone who rates this less than four stars, even if they say stuff like \\"Yes is my favorite band\\", just can not truly be that big a fan. Because if they really did dig Yes then they would LOVE this dvd.<br /><br />Anyone who complains about the video and/or audio expects too much. This is what it is. Yes live in 1972, the Close To The Edge tour and playin' to beat the devil.<br /><br />Hey, I'm not arguing about the sound or picture, its not that great. But it doesn't matter. Its the performance on this particular dvd, and it IS that great. This is Yes at their very best.<br /><br />If you love Yes don't even worry about the sound/pic. Given, by today's standards its not good. But not so bad that it should stop you from watching this disc over and over.<br /><br />Probably not for the casual Yes fan, and if you really dig Yes then you most likely already own it, so I really don't know why I bothered to write this. But here it is.<br /><br />I'm going to see Yes this summer. Last time I saw them was 1979, \\"in the round\\" on the Tormato tour. Where did the time go?
B0002BO05S|4.0|This is an outstanding rendition of the Gospel story.  Many of the scenes in this film are as artistic as a Renaissance painting.  Max von Sydow's portayal of Jesus is credible and the story remains The Greatest Story Ever Told.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This product did just as it was suppose to do! I got it for my kindle HD and I am please with the product!
0670026182|5.0|Received Katie's Cookbook from Amazon and it was everything I expected it to be.Great recipes,mouth watery photos,and beautiful cover,I didn't put it down until I had read it from cover to cover.
B0094K1K42|1.0|I like Charlize Theron which is why I endured as much of this movie as I could. But it was terrible and I never made it to the end.
B004HD61KE|5.0|A super page-turner. I love a book that subtly appeals to the wanna-be scholar within me and yet stays breathtakingly entertaining. I think James Rollins hit that mark.
B00498YZH8|2.0|This is a lame movie. There's really not much to it and it is so incorrect in many ways. I don't know the director or screen writer but it could have been done much better.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I have seen this movie 4 times already and I really like it. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Never got an opportunity to read this until now....what a story!  Beyond a classic wish I wouldn't have waited so long
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Being a long time fan of Led Zeppelin, I have never come across an alblum I didn't like. This one is just great!
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Love this character.  Love being able to follow Harry from one murder to the next! This book is hard to put down.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book was able to lay out a great workout plan and diet routine, which were simple to follow and allow you to make tremendous improvements in your strength and health. I found a ton of great advice that has made me much more focused on the important things and saved me a ton of headaches and money.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|EDIT: If you are marking this review as unhelpful, please comment below as I would love to hear why you think so. In order to give potential customers the most informed opinion, discourse is good - so please tell me why you don't agree (be forewarned, I may rebut). It is my intention to provide the most thorough review of the film possible without spoilers. Please refrain from posting them in the comment section of this review.<br /><br />Premise: One year after the harrowing events of \\"The Avengers\\", Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) is a changed man - he's seen things and now they're taking a toll on his psyche and his relationship with Pepper (Paltrow). When a mysterious terrorist known only as the Mandarin (Kingsley) initiates a series of terrorist attacks against the United States, tragedy hits home for Stark - stirring him to action. As Stark investigates this new foe, he learns about the technological program known as \\"Extremis\\" which brings him against a new line of cyber-enhanced foes that might be more than a match for Iron Man...<br /><br />Thoughts: Iron Man III is Marvel's unveiling of \\"Phase II\\" - the lead up to Avengers II - and it presents a subtly different take on Tony Stark/Iron Man. Taking over directorial duties for Jon Favreau is Shane Black (the acclaimed inventor of the Buddy Cop genre with his screenplay for Lethal Weapon), who brings a sharp flair for humorous quirk and sharp wit, which complements Robert Downey Jr.'s performance and enhances it. This film retains the charm of its predecessors while diving head into an exceptionally exciting genre: the technological thriller. On this third go around, the cast gels - Cheadle, Paltrow, Favreau and Downey all hit the ground running. The new additions (Pearce, Kingsley, and Hall) all act as very strong foils to each of the main cast and help develop the acclaimed \\"Extremis\\" story line from the comics. That said, certain stylistic elements were questionable: such as the Mandarin's voice - which has heavily reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker - gets a tad old quickly but with purpose. However, this is overshadowed by better choices: such as Tony's friendship with a young boy named Harley, which illustrates a side of him we have not scene before. The film is full of unexpected surprises and touching emotional moments which make this film a must see. And like all Marvel films, be sure to stick around for after the credits for a nice little post-credit scene involving a character we have seen before in a surprising situation. ;) \\"I'm not that kind of doctor...\\"<br /><br />Should you buy this film? Absolutely. Iron Man III is the first \\"Must See\\" summer blockbuster of 2013 and it more than redeems Marvel for their last solo Iron Man film, which felt more like a commercial and less like a movie. Exceptionally crafted, brilliantly directed and realistically dealing with the \\"why not just call the Avengers\\" problem in a satisfying manner, this film will be a great collection for any fan of comics, Downey Jr. or Shane Black. For best viewing - get the Bluray: you'll get a DVD copy and a Digital copy so you can watch on the go - well worth the extra definition on the television.<br /><br />IRON MAN III stars: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Guy Pearce, Rebecca Hall, Stephanie Szostak, James Badge Dale, Jon Favreau, Ben Kingsleyy reminiscent of Heath Ledger's Joker - gets a tad old quickly but with purpose.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game for children and adults. Easy to play. Nice graphics and sound effects. Lots of characters to buy and use.
B001NLCBJI|4.0|A wonderful and subtle film about the journeys we take and the choices we make through life. It is both quiet and jarring like the Tokyo experience and Coppola captures the essence of the city in just a short two hour period. Bill Murray is wonderful and Scarlett Johansen is like a little cherry blossom - a timeless piece of work.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A novel based in Ireland and it's people is always worth the read for me. Thankfully this book does not feature characters with timeless beauty. Following a story about two ordinary people was such a pleasure.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved every but of it!! I would highly recommend this to everyone!! I'm looking forward to more of Mitch Alboms books!!
B004XWMXW4|5.0|I very much enjoy cello music, but tire of the same old classical songs.  This cd totally rocks combining the classy sound of cellos with contemporary music that even my 8 year old enjoys!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|I watched this movie because the reviewers rated it so highly, which should have been my tip-off.  I hated this movie!  It was very sick, disgusting and depressing.  This was a study of a mentally disturbed woman who no one could help.  If you were contemplating suicide, this would be the movie to push you over the edge.  Very disturbing with an unnecessary lesbian scene and masturbation scene, just to titillate audiences.  Ugh!  I felt that the sex scenes were only put in the movie to have the audience become accustomed to seeing the pornography exhibited in this sick movie so they can get R-rated movies pushed over to the X-rated themes.  If want to see a visually beautiful movie about ballet,  with a wonderful storyline, see THE RED SHOES.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|If you love dragons, you will love Dragonvale. I was looking for a slow pace, non-violent game with dragons. I got my wish with Dragonvale. I own 2 tablets and 1 phone, Dragonvale is on all 3. I love the graphics and free range of the game. The game is not hard to play nor is it hard to get gems. 100% satisfied. :-)
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It's a really fun, lighthearted piece. It kind of reminded me of Bring It On at times.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of a capella so I was inclined to like it no matter what.
B004AO4FJ4|4.0|As a huge sci-fi fan, I had to watch Doctor Who after all the buzz it's received. I must admit it was very different at first, not the typical American-Style sci-fi we see here...but I liked it! It was refreshing to see the entire season unravel, a lot of things I did not expect. Just when I was really liking this duo-- the Doctor changes form...WHY??? Now onto the second season, to fall in love with the next Doctor...and then at the end of his turn ask the same question all over again haha.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I got halfway through the first book and went ahead and ordered the second. Read them back to back and cant wait for the next one.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Awesome product could not ask for a thing better.  Pronounces words..gives options..excellent help for all who does played scrabble .
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like the help.because sometimes I miss a play<br />I also like the different lay outs and its easy to play.  I  have been playing solitaire for over 50 years.<br />Like the simplicity  .
B001QFZADA|5.0|It's very easy to read and loaded full of wonderful advice and supporting stories.  Anyone who wants or is in a relationship should read this book.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Like myself, some individuals would find this very interesting and enjoyable reading, while others that prefer faster moving story lines may find it a bit slow.  I appreciate a break from the usual crime drama mystery who-done-its and my preferred thriller types.
1451695195|5.0|Written by a person with all the medical credibility in the world.  VERY informative and and the most believable of all NDE's
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is extreemly useful for the kindle fire as the kindle does not come with any percentage information on the percentage of battery left. It also shows you how your use effects battery charge.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|Absolutely amazing album, I recommend this album to anyone who appreciates good extreme metal. Great band, great album. From start to finish it does not disappoint.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I like the fact that it is a challenge, but it can be done!  It's a fun game for your brain!
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|Two interesting characters but incomplete storyline that leads to nowhere and leave you indifferent. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful as always, love to watch his play.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Was just getting that classic, eerie, Stephen King, this is going to be an awesome story feeling when, boom, it was over.  Disappointed.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is a high-quality, period-piece drama.  Well written, acted, and gloriously well-filmed.  I very much appreciate the historical accuracy from a time period that is often neglected in entertainment.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of the most addictive shows I have ever seen.  Well acted and produced.  They do a great job of making you want more.
B005ES11YW|5.0|great shoes as expected, very comfortable, but then again croc's are awesome, will continue to buy croc's, my son loves them too
B003ASLJK4|5.0|Perfect chick flick to watch with your girlfriends.  It's such a simple movie in simpler times.  Keep tissues handy...you'll need them.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Wonderful to watch. The scenic is also beautiful.  Story is predictable, but its not the ending that matter; it is how you get to the ending. The writer does a brillian job in creating the story.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Loved the  storyline and plot but some parts I could not watch because of the inhumane ways in which some of the characters died.  Quentin went a little overboard with the blood.
B001NA6096|5.0|This movie only gets better with time. First saw it when I was in my teens. Then saw it again in my early twenties. Then again when Before Sunset came out. I got something different from it each and every time.
B009IQG5LK|4.0|Always liked this movie and the blu-ray has a gorgeous print of it. The detail is excellent.One of Warren Beatty's best.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is a good way to pass time if you are into virtual city builders. I like the transportation aspect of the game.  The reason for the 4 star is the almost constant posting to facebook. The posting to facebook is almost a requirment to continue advancing at a decent pace to earn investment points---unless of course you want to spend cash to buy the points.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I started playing this game when I got my kindle last year and it just keeps getting better. The only thing that I don't like is that a lot of the TACK cost gems and they are hard to get.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Riordan does it again and obviously saved the best for last. The story was so well written that I could not put this book down.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I saw it in the theater, I bought it, I'll see the next one.  My son and I really enjoyed it.  Is it LOTR? No.  In fact, that's my main problem with the Hobbit--Jackson wants to create another LOTR but that is never what The Hobbit was--it was more of an exciting betime story than an epic tale.  That said, I don't think he ruined it and it is much better than most movies out there!  Can't wait for Smaug!
0452277752|5.0|Nice to still be able to hunt down the original Bachman stuff, especially Rage, which has been pulled from publication due to recent copycats.
B005O64VJQ|4.0|Very good little movie. Kevin Kline is hilarious, with nice support work from Cleese and Palin. Jamie Lee Curtis was never lovelier.
B0027MJU00|4.0|The storyline was horrific and I couldn't stop thinking of In Cold Blood. But here was this survivor who made me feel the pain and guilt of living.  The struggle to grow up am<br />Nd learn what you need to do to move through this grow up<br /><br />Loved the details of the farm and ones feet in the thick mud and the love of fox tails in the field.  Not a surprise she grew up in Kansas. Thank u
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hope you buy this game it is amazing it is just like the Xbox and pc or computer version worth the sevendollars
