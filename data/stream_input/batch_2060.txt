B0000DIXDR|4.0|Patrick Swayze may be dead but he is still hot as a firecracker in this movie.  If you are buying this movie, I garuantee this is why your buying the movie.  It does the job.  4 stars.  The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because everytime they showed Jennifer Gray... I kind of went limp (and I'm a girl) so it was reallly a turn off.  Bluh
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|We thought the movie, acting and music were great...the sound quality was eh on Amazon. First one we've rented this way so don't know if it's typical. It kept cutting in and out which was annoying.
B0011AQLZQ|5.0|Excellent movie, glad it was available in digital so I could have it on my kindle.  I highly recommend this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book love anything Nicholas Srarks writes very moving keeps you wanting to read more its just like you are right there
B0019IB0II|5.0|Should you or a loved one ever be unfortunate to have a stroke - this book is most informative.  Read it just to be prepared.  Thank you Dr. Taylor for sharing your experience.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the trilogy, however it becomes very dark and in the end leaves me some what unsatisfied.  I am still looking for some answers to the final actions in the Capitol and was discouraged by the never ending tragedies befalling Katniss, I think we all understand war is he'll but sometimes a necessary thing!
B000QRIGLC|4.0|While I don't call this book \\"inspirational,\\" as I don't ever want to \\"aspire\\" to go through what this man endured, it certainly is a testament to his survival abilities.  It's also not a difficult read and will keep your interest at all times, but be warned:  This is a heavy read.<br /><br />What I mean by that is it's not, exactly, going to lift your spirits.  You will certainly laugh at times, but you will also wonder how much can one person endure.<br /><br />In the end, you will have experienced a gambit of emotions and be very proud of the US military service members (especially this one).  And, hopefully, you will also learn to question the media... not the first amendment, but certainly why they report what the do these days and where any form of ethics in there reporting has gone.
1439152802|3.0|Some undeveloped characters and stretches of predictable story telling. I think I was not particularly drawn to any of the main characters until the last 25% of the book. So I guess I enjoyed some of the book but plodded through some of it as well.
B009JBZH54|5.0|After having purchased the first two movies of the trilogy, I figured buying the box set was the better deal rather than just buying The Dark Knight Rises by itself. With the format on Blu Ray and with the bonus discs, it's really worth the money!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Totally engrossed from the first chapter.  Enjoyed the characters, even the ones I disliked!  Felt a lot of empathy for the family of Jacob. Interesting court room action as well.
0810970686|5.0|I ordered the whole set of these books for my 11 yr old son. They are great books to read at that age. They arrived very quickly and looked great.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|What can I say?  The usual mystery, back-stabbing, dysfunction, ...  Although Don Draper seems to have mellowed this season. I love the costumes & props - I had some of these items.
B00AGH5LF6|4.0|It has become a Christmas tradition for me to watch Home Alone 1 and 2 every year. The second film is not as good as the first, but it is still a classic. These are two of my favorite films!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So far, season three is just as addictive as previous seasons.  Excellent character development and gripping suspense.  Oh yeah, and plenty more zombies!
B0095R64AO|3.0|Good movie. There were parts that were unexpected. The preview tricks the viewer into thinking it is more funny than what it is. This is definitely more of a drama. It had a predictable ending.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Enjoyable games lots of different styles. The variety is great playing it is great way to pass some time. Enjoy
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I liked the movie, but it wasn't as funny as I was hoping it was going to be. The message that it carries is very good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Kids love it. Entertainable will help pass some time in an enjoyable fashion. A great game that is free is always nice.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Unfortunately, i believed the hype and praise and bought it.<br /><br />I read this book cover to cover very quickly.  It's an easy read and interesting.  However, I enjoy getting lost in my books, and that did not happen with this one.  The main character was just stupid.  What sane person would make the decisions he does, not once or twice, but continually?!  It was really disruptive to the flow of the book.  I teetered between wanting him to get justice and hoping he got exactly what his decisions deserved.  (Not a good place for a main character to be.)<br /><br />Finally, I absolutely agree that the ending was disappointing.  It doesn't need to be a happily-ever-after, but it would be nice to feel a sense of completion and satisfaction.  Not here.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|DONT GET THIS GAME. THEY MADE IT LIKE TEMPLE RUN. THEY ARE COPY CATS BIG TIME!!!I HATE THIS GAME!!!I'M DELETING GAME!!!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love it because it actually helps me with fractions instead of those crappy calculators that you always have to remember your decimals.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I enjoy building the carts and figuring out which way they should go. It is a fun game. You will enjoy this is you like the other angry bird games.
B0046RE5GI|5.0|as usual another excellent Poirot story, which is very complex and intricate, and there are aspect of spyish theme throughout
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my kids got me hooked on the first so obviously i had to get 2. i am horrible at this game but have a lot of fun playing.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|This is popcorn crunching, good movie making. But seriously, the older I get, the more respect I have for those few who put something together for the public to see (actors, directors, producers and writers). Even though Sylvester Stallone plays parts where he  doesn't look that smart, he writes, produces, directs, acts and stars in a lot of movies that make money. Go Rocky.<br /><br />...Dave101
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game. The  free trial stops just when it starts to get really good. This seems to be the same for all their games.
B007WOFXAO|5.0|If you like trhe band 'America', you'll love this complete collection!!  Saw them live recently and this brought back a lot of great memories.  It will for you too, I'm sure.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|this was a pretty funny movie worth the watch but not the funniest thing I have watch with seth in it.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|what else can I say?? 15 more words are required. to hell with brevity, huh? must be an idea shared with the producers.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It will be difficult for me to read another memoir after this, or indeed, any book.<br /><br />I will, however, be purchasing a pair of (right-sized) hiking boots.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|my sister liked it but I didn't it was so slow when I went to go enter my horse in a competition it wouldn't even loaf when I went to go use a new nickname it says I'm sorry we cannot use that name and then it would craggy it crashed 7 times on me it needs to be fixed BADLY at the end I just deleted it
0553801473|4.0|While some portions were dissapointing, I think that with such a large reservoir of characters and lands that is bound to happen.<br /><br />I found the overall story continued from the other four books, it definitely flowed a little slower. Still plenty happened to keep you wishing for the 6 th edition and of course there was a cliffhanger ending that was shocking but not altogther unexpected.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I deleted the first temple run because the game would freeze for a second several times each game. I was hoping this one would work properly but it is doing the same thing. It makes the game unplayable, I will be uninstalling right after this review.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|So much happened in this book, it just seemed unreal.... But in a good way. I love how Ana and Christian made chAnges for the better for one another. Excellent ending....
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|Magic academy was fun with many levels. A lot of similarities but lots of challenges too. I did not have any trouble playing it on my Kindle hd7 .
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I thought this was a perfect ending to the Dark Knight series. If the series finds new life via the Robin character  that would be awesome.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is not microsoft office, however my tablet is not a desk top computer. Functions are not as full at Microsoft, but when I am not at my desk I can load this on my tablet and it works.
B005CGI4EG|3.0|For the price it's an incredible deal.  All 11 seasons for $35 is pretty hard to beat.  It kinda bugs me that they cheaped out on the title music and the packaging.  The original Frank Sinatra song they used on the opening/closing credits got replaced with a crummy knock-off that sounds more like polka.  The packaging is pretty bad too.  It opens up with 2 spindles on each side with the discs all stacked on each other with a piece of cardboard holding them in place.  It came unglued and pretty much fell apart the day i bought it.  But overall it's still a good deal, and I'll just take a hot glue gun to the package, then get my Bundy on.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The series keeps me guessing. The writer really knows how to keep you on your toes and easily fall in love with her characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|simple and easy to use.  does everything you need it to do.  give it a 5 star rating for sure
B009FZHYKU|5.0|can't wait for the second have of season 3 -- i thought i was a little too old to be &#34;into&#34; zombie shows --- NOPE!  love it!
B00A8ECU24|4.0|this is a great game! very fun! it is like sim city meets my little pony! but the reason for the 4 stars is that the hard to get gems\\"the ones you have to buy\\" now they do give you some of them as you go through the game, the only problem is the gems disappear for no reason sometimes, you will exit the game and come back later and there will be 10 gems gone! now you don't NEED gems to win the game, you win when you activate all the elements of harmony. but it is still a pain to loose your gems for no reason, they have it programmed to try to get you to buy more of them, but other than that it is a VERY fun game! and even if you don't spend any real money you will still have a blast! just watch your kids so they do spend a ton of money on it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its the most COOLEST GAME IN THE WHOLE WORLD. I love it.<br />But I just don't get the updates right away<br />But its so cool I have to make a new word that means beyond awesome or amazing. You should buy it right NOW!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a great series.  You had to watch every CD because it kept you on the edge of your seat.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|It was clever and funny!  There was some adult humor to keep parents watching it but clean and nothing inappropriate!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This product was not purchased by me. It is here in error. Belongs to some other purchaser. I hope it was a good one.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I purchased it thinking it thinking that it would be something completely different, due to not reading the short version. Anyway it was very romantic and raw, which always keeps a person reading more. Excellent writing. Excellent story. I would recommend this book to a friend or any of the teenage girls that I work with at a therapeutic boarding school in Montana.
B008476HBM|5.0|Placed in my file by error. Did not purchase this book. However, a great book of encouragement available at Amazon.com is Footsteps of Recovery.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|it had all the mummy movies in it and with buying the scorpion king 1 movie too i finished them all out
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I absolutely loved the first season and this season does not disappoint!!! Absolutely a must-watch. Can't wait for next season!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I thought this game was interesting. Different from a lot of G5 games. But I enjoyed playing it. Unfortunately it didn't take me long to complete, cause  I sat and played it for three hours straight. But it is definitely worth the 2.99
034580404X|5.0|I keep all these books by the side of my bed and pick them up frequently, opening them at random.  Such pleasure.  Of course I love the erotic aspects, but I love the characters more.  These people come from such different places in life.  They work so hard to make their relationship work.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Like the carnival game, this app leaves you on the edge wanting to know what happens next. It's difficult at times but a lot of fun to use your brain to think outside the box and search for stuff to get to the next step. Definitely a favorite of mine. Now to try it in expert mode...
B00B2V66VS|3.0|good time waster. Like the changes fromthe first one. looks better, but essentially the same game. if you looked the other you'll like this.
B00AFEY354|5.0|When I think of this movie, I think about perfection. Everything about it is spot on. The acting, the directing, the music, the story, everything. Had their not been so much focus on Argo, Lincoln, Zero Dark, and Les Mis, this movie would have won many awards.<br /><br />The story keeps you guessing and is anything but predictable. There are several things hidden from you as the plot unfolds and right away the mind gets busy trying to figure everything out.<br /><br />You feel very involved when watching Charlie's freshman year in high school progress. You root for him and are riding on his emotions, but you are also trying to understand who exactly he is.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, the basis goes like this: Charlie's best friend shot himself the summer before Charlie goes to high school. As a result, he enters high school as a loner and outcast, and has to try to get through the year with as little resistance as he can. Luckily he starts to make friends and you are brought into their lives with Charlie.<br /><br />Many moral issues surface along the way. Not directly, but they are happening. With so much going on to the different characters, you are bound to be sucked in by this movie. One of the story lines will grab your heart and you will enjoy it. My sister doesn't even like movies, but we forced he to watch this and she loved it. We all did.
B007NUP5OG|5.0|It's better than \\"Hung Up\\" and it's just what one would come to expect from the Queen of Pop herself!  Beat for beat, measure for measure, word for word, this one will keep you on the dancefloor for a good long time!  It's actually surprising to me how it wasn't a #1 Pop hit.  I don't get it.  It's got all the makings of ANY and ALL of her previous Pop hits.  Thankfully, it was a #1 Dance hit.  AbsoLUTELY LOVE IT!!!  Hopefully, you will TOO!  :-)
B001TCHDPS|4.0|This guy is Bob Dylan, but with a smoother voice.<br /><br />Coming from Reality is superb and was produced with perfect quality. It is a more sophisticated album than Cold Fact, using more complex recording techniques, and a wider variety of instruments, but Cold Fact was just a bit better musically in my opinion.<br /><br />This album is great, don't get me wrong, but if you're torn between buying this one and Cold Fact, go with Cold Fact.<br /><br />Most of the songs here are very melodic and are easy on the ears. There isn't as much rock-n-roll and blues as there was in Cold Fact, making this album a much more softer, love story type album. The message here is clearly about a man who is seeking love and remember loves he had. It's beautifully structured and th bonus tracks take this album above and beyond.<br /><br />The track Cause could have been a top ten single and having that song alone makes this a good buy. Don't settle for the album without the bonus tracks, they make this album superior.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson deMille always writes a good book. The panther is pertinent to what's going on right now. Once you started, you won't put it down.
B005LAII12|4.0|Teddy bears are usually little romantic cuddle buddies for youngsters and cheesy gifts you give your girlfriend. Ted on the other hand is a hell raising, perverted bear that could party with the most outrageous of fraternity guys and rock stars.<br /><br />There are laughs coming from everywhere in this flick which is to be expected when you're watching Seth MacFarlane, but I was surprised at the beauty of the storyline here. You wouldn't expect it, but this is a well written love story. Mila Kunis plays her role as a snobby girlfriend well, and Marky Mark plays the man caught between girl and Teddy Bear very well. Watching their story unfold is a joy.<br /><br />If you're a family guy fan than this is a must see, and if not, as long as you can appreciated some dirty jokes and aren't easily offended, this movie will suit you well. Tune in to Ted and never look at another innocent teddy bear the same again.
0061726834|5.0|I loved this book and I loved Oliver's writing.<br /><br />Delerium is a dystopian novel where they've cured the disease of love and everyone is compliant and complacent and there is very little conflict or crime. You get the operation when you turn 18, typically. Lena, who has looked forward to receiving the cure her whole life, falls in love a couple of months before she is to receive the cure.  She also battles the demons of her family's shame: her mother's suicide, an uncle who ran away...<br /><br />Like I said, Oliver's writing is amazing. At times, it is even poetic. I loved simply reading the sentences she put together.<br /><br />The characters are well rounded and engaging. I could feel for Lena and the dilemma she was facing - going with what she has been brought up to believe and what her family, government and society expect from her, or to follow her heart.  It's an age old dilemma but spotlighted in a dystopian future.<br /><br />The other characters where great too. Hana, Lena's best friend, was a perfect foil. Their friendship evolved and changed, which felt realistic. Then there was Alex. The romance between Lena and Alex was nice and I appreciated how conflicted Lena was about the whole thing.<br /><br />Then, there was the ending. I won't say anything to spoil it, but I loved that it was unexpected.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading the next one in this series, along with everything else by Oliver that I can get my hands on.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Love this album! All the songs are wonderful! I listen to it all the time, I can't get enough of them!
B005K17RU0|4.0|Opens to your weekly outlook in a simple, bold, clear format, and you navigate to more detailed reports or other features from there.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Okay, this story through me for a loop. I did not, in any way see the ending coming- at all. I mean, the author seriously sets you up for one story and then BOOM, you find out all these secrets and you had no idea they were even coming. Absolutely wonderful
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an amazing follow-up to the original, it's a little glitchy at times but it Is still version 1.0 . As far as gameplay it is same tried and true control but they still managed to add some new difficulty. I'm very satisfied with the game, highest so far is 11.8 million!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Kindle fire- has some bug that shuts down game when trying to use gems to purchase new life and continue. Very aggrevating.
B004JK61K0|4.0|Didn't fix my issue but not its fault bad kindle.  Am getting a replacement.  Won't review an app again too many hoops to go through!
B000B589JI|4.0|Well built: except for it not being completely de-burred... nothing sharp at all:)  Just had to work it with a stiff brush to get rid of some fine filaments of aluminum I didn't want tracking in the treading. Just a little bit more than having to clean it. So far... I would still recommend this to a friend.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|I like Harry Potter but the only thing, is not your fault, is that the audio language comes in spanish &#34;Spain&#34; and not from other places, for example Costa Rica but it is fine
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Really like this game.  The puzzles are well made and very colorful.  They start our easy then get a little harder as you progress in levels.  I would recommend you download the free one to see if you like this kind of Puzzle.  It is a little different than a jigsaw puzzle as they show you a picture with several pieces missing and you need to figure out where they go and replace them.  There are six puzzles in each level and then you have a challenge level where you try to complete those same six in two minutes.  They give you a choice to do the challenge level or move on to the next level so you are never stuck on one level.  I've only done three levels so far but I am already hoping they release more levels for this game.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I like this because it is the most realistic version I have found without purchasing the real table version.  Love it
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|One of my favorite movies! The whole series is great and the director and actors did a really excellent job! I have yet to find a person that doesn't love this movie!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I got this game for my son on his Nabi tablet and he loves playing it. It's like Mario brothers
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I love this movie! This director definitely doesn't disappoint! Batman begins and The dark knight (the first two movies in this serires) are really great movies and im glad this one lived up to my expectations. I know many movies that get worse as squeals come out but this is definitely not one of them!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Best game ever... plus a really good way to pass time... it was really fun and made me really horny... Mmmm
B0086700CM|4.0|great fun very enjoyable l<br />love it I play agaisnt my daughter she tends to be better then me. play it
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The mission: you must make friends, gather allies and stop the murders and the killer in this mystery-based and twist-filled story.<br /><br />Definitely the best Vita game so far. Persona 4 Golden is a JRPG with a good story line, lovable characters, and an addictive dungeon crawler.<br />You play as a new transfer student who moves to a small town just before a killer starts murdering people. You discover you have the ability to enter TVs into a world filled with monsters, and that you can to call on your own monsters, aka Persona. Your Persona gets more powerful by forging bonds and relationships with the people in your new town.<br /><br />A slandered play through is probably about 60 hours. The dungeon crawler part will probably take up about a quarter of this time. You wander through the 8 rather large dungeons (plus a smaller one that could be counted as a ninth), opening chest for supplies  and fighting the monsters known as shadows. You do this for money, items and to get new Persona. The other way to get a new Persona is to fuse a few tougher  The battles are turn by turn but there are other elements to account for like building a good team, paying attention to the different weakness of the shadows and the occasional support you may get from the allies not currently in the party.<br /><br />When you are not dungeon crawling, you are in town. You need to boost stats like courage and intelligence to make and strengthen the bonds you make with people. This is the true experience in this game. The characters are voiced and dialogued  The voice acting is some of the best I've ever heard, but some also sounds a little phoned in. You must do all of this within a year of the game's calendar  which is when the main character leaves the town. You must also make a decision on how to spend your days and nights that are not guided by plot. This is one of the game's weakness  Since it is so big, and you have a limited amount of time to complete the game, you may often get the feeling that you are missing something.These characters and plots will make you laugh and cry because of the awesome voice acting.<br /><br />The graphics and gameplay will give away that this used to be a ps2 game but there are a few features made especially for the Vita. There is a new menu where you can listen to the music from the game, replay one of the fully animated cut scenes, learn about the psychology references in the game, watch old Persona series trailers, look at game art and play a quiz game. In game, there is also a feature witch lets you see what other people did if you need a suggestion on how to spend your day in the game.<br /><br />New players may have a little trouble getting started. Even though the tutorial is very long, it is not as specific and helpful as it should be, but by reading the manual and looking up tips online new players should be fine.<br /><br />Persona 4 is a triumph in the Vita's currently smallish game selection. Get this game.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;et the feeling that you are missing something.These characters and plots will make you laugh and cry because of the awesome voice acting.<br /><br />The graphics and gameplay will give away that this used to be a ps2 game but there are a few features made especially for the Vita.

1616550414|5.0|Received mine on Jan. 29th with two day shipping. Arrived in pristine condition, and couldn't wait to read it. This book covers the entire series (in Nintendo's eyes), and finally puts an end to the timeline debates (for now). Dark Horse did an amazing translation of the Japanese version. If you're on the fence on buying this, I'd say it's definitely worth it.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I have just discovered this Lee Child character and I really like the read. Nothing complicated about the plot and the story is great.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Best Gamepad yet.<br /><br />Long Review to Follow<br />I have owned the N52, N52TE and now the G13.<br /><br />The N52 original - Good for first pad, but Dpad is stiff and hard to manuever, keys are hard to press, some keys almost feel like they stick. Software allows you to program, however worst software of the 3 as programming it is horrendous after using the other 2. Basically the launcher and profile recognition needs to be loaded manually and the tray is seperate from the programmer, so you have to open a different profile to load vs program keys.<br /><br />N52TE - Fixed all problems with original N52, Buttons press nicely, Dpad = Much improved, scroll wheel is a scroll wheel, not a click wheel,  Software allows you to open tray icon, edit macros/bindings/recordings, and send to controller.<br /><br />G13 - First off, it is better just because it has more keys.  however 4 keys are pretty difficult to press, G20/G21/G22 require you to either fully move your hand, or use the bottom of fingers, kind of like palm pressing with your fingers.  Then there is good ole G1, which is very hard to distinguisher from G2, even after lots of practice.<br />The point here is dont be fooled by just the labeled # of buttons, realistically you get I about 3-5 more keys that can be used on a normal cycle.  i actually prefer the N52TE Joystick Dpad to the G13 from a control standpoint, however the G13 Joystick does become pretty easy to use over time.<br />I was unsure if this would work for me as I dont have huge hands, and this thing is huge, however I can use all the buttons, and unless you have terribly terribly small hands, I think most people will be fine.<br /><br />The place the G13 to me comes out ahead is in the configuration and software.<br />First off the software is 20x better than the competitors.  It autoloads bindings when they are assigned, (assuming the correct profile is selected and activated). Secondly, I run multiple toons, and do some dual boxing, so keeping track of bindings and macros would be a nightmare.  The G13 allows you to add (or it saves if you manually add) macros and key binding commands for later use.  So say I want B to open my Bags,  when you add the key binding the first time, it saves it in the program, so when you are building another set of bindings for another toon, its simple drag and drop, Drag B (you can rename it to anything you want for ID purposes).  This is extremely important because working in reverse, with all the mixed up bindings i have for different toons due to dual boxing, sometimes i forget what a key does, or what i set to open my bags on a certain toon.  You can just open up the G13 software and if you name your bindings like I do, see that &#34;Oh this key opens my bags&#34; or this key does this.<br /><br />Also if you use the G600 or other Logitech programmable mice, they use the same program! which also means above applies and also I forgot to mention that the logitech software shows you what keys are currently being used, so it makes it a lot easier to find new bindings when you are running short of keys and combinations due to conflicting bindings with other toons.<br /><br />The Auto Profile switcher works pretty well, sometimes i need to click out and back into the window to get the right profile to activate, however since you can color code your profiles (and even application specific) to almost infinite colors and combinations, it can be very easy recognize and fix.  I especially like the last feature, as I can have my normal windows activities Blue, and in game Red for M1.  for M2 i have pink for normal and white for in game, so it is very easy to recognize and correct if the right profiles dont activate right away.<br /><br />The Game LCD is nice if you play a game that recognizes it and has profiles for it, obviously based on what your play, but can have some useful features.<br /><br />To finish up, to me the N52TE is more comfortable to use initially, however after hours of play your hand does start to hurt.  The G13 isnt as comfortable to me, but my hands dont hurt as much after playing for long periods of time.<br /><br />In short I would choose the G13 no questions asked over the rest given it has more buttons and better software even if it were 2x the price.  Since its actually cheaper right now, there is no reason I would buy a N52TE.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|It was an interesting way to look at one's profession as &#34;your art&#34;.  Thinking of how one would move through the day with the idea to ship, on each task. Creating, and making a difference as a linchpin, makes one step back and perform with their very best.

B00846REIS|3.0|This is a good read but does not compare to Fifty Shades.  I really felt like it was a copycat and I guess my loyalty lies with Fifty Shades.
B003Y5H59C|2.0|This movie was recommended by a friend, and not what I thought it would be.  I can see that it may have a following but not my thing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a fantastic story.  Leaves you wanting more on all accounts. Very well written and the characters are amazing. A must read over and over and over. Now lets see the movie.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I got this app for my new Kindle Fire HD that I got for Christmas.  The weather report is easy to use and has many sites that can be used.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thank you for this series. A wonderfully written book and story line. This author keeps you interested through the whole story.  I love Christian and cannot wait for more.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Still magical; still mesmerizing.  My granddaughter absolutely loved it.  She smiled through the whole thing.  I forgot how much fun it was!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Excellent book but sad to see the story end.  Definitely felt lonely that the series ended because I could read more about Christian.  I cannot wait to see how they do the movie.  I have read this series 4 times and will probably read again.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|11/22/63 by Stephen King is a powerful book.  Although long, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  This adds a new meaning to &#34;what if.&#34;  I enjoyed the factual aspect of the story and I constantly flashed back to where I was when JFK was murdered.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anything Nicholas Sparks is great!  Definitely a fun read.  Decided to read this prior to watching the movie.  Definitely recommend it.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|When I first bought the single disc release, I had no idea what I was missing out on in the way of extras. And the price couldn't be beat!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|As usual, G5 has created another visually striking, interesting game. The puzzles were a bit too simplistic, even in expert mode. Other than that I truly enjoyed it.
B00018D3RI|5.0|What a wonderful series. Soul and Glaser shine together in this seminal buddy cop show that has influenced so many others.
B002M9WW30|4.0|great movies, classics. good sound with the blu ray and clearer picture. A steal for the price i had paid.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|This is a useful app to supplement an existing routine, or to use alone. It has several different workouts (cardio, abs, legs, arms, etc) and you can select the length of the workout (5, 7.5 or 10 mins). It has a person performing the routine, so you can do it correctly. I would have given it 5 stars, except it lacks an audio time keeper. But for a free app, it's great!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Totally awesome. LOVE it. Can't wait for the final book in the hunger games series. I am your biggest fan.
B009S33I68|5.0|This book is easy to read but is essentially the diary of a battle and a record of the deaths of many fine young men. It is gripping reading. It is not a story but rather a personal history of great courage and sacrifice. I did not go to Vietnam during the war but this put me there in the heat of battle and made me think of why good people do not come back from these events. It is easy to see why in this book.
B009KKLQKO|5.0|It's the Beach Boys of course it WONDERFUL!!!!! Just wish it could be even longer. Also reaalized that John Cowsill was the drummer, saw him years ago with him family.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Hilarious! It was worth buying, I will definitely watch it over and again:). If you love music and funny you'll love this movie!
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Watched it 3 times with my grand kids,  I think Skrat is our new hero! I would reccomend Ice Age Continental Drift to anyone, no matter your age.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I had purchased this CD along with Susan Boyle's &#34;The Gift&#34; for my Mom for Christmas.  She LOVES listening to them.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|This movie did not make much sense. I kept checking the timer to see when it would be over.<br /><br />Would not recommend.

B002EEP3NO|5.0|I've been eyeballing this for quite some time and finally splurged just after the holidays. Had such a fun time building this. Most importantly I was extremely impressed that I was not missing one single piece!
B000062XGK|5.0|My husband and I both love this underwater horror classic film.  It's great fun and was very well written.  The acting was superb including a nice underlying love story and character arc.  Great anti-climatic and climatic moments that keep you on the edge of your seat.  The special effects were outstanding!  Highly recommend you add this to your library.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This is a fabulous Cd, I love the bluesy sound and you will too!  You can see why this is so popular!
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Gosh, everyone falls in love with Robert Duvall in this fabulous classic western film.  If you love westerns this is a must to add to your collection.  The relationship between Gus McCrae and Woodrow Call in the rugged wilderness they called home is truly one of Hollywood's greatest duos.  There is an ongoing series of tragedies that plague this couple as they move their herd cross country from Texas to Montana along with various plots that intertwine throughout making this a memorable saga that will emotionally move both men and women alike.  This is a must in everyone's video library.  If you don't have it you don't know what you're missing!  Highly recommended!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|Really great to watch I love 1D soo much so it is a great movie to see. I love these boys to death and here is a good video to prove it :)
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Once again a classic belongs in its own category and deserves to be left alone.  I'm not dogging the remakes as some are very good, but face it, once the idea has been done leave it alone.  We all know the concept behind this film is what made it so great.  That's why it's a classic.  Sure, any film can be improved but the original form is always in a class of its own.  Donald Pleasance left his mark in the world with 'Halloween'.  As a lead character, he did a great job.  This also got Jamie Lee Curtis into the spotlight.  I would recommend this film to all horror lovers!
B004C3DLJS|5.0|...if they leave it there, anyway. Funny and meaningful, just as good as the best Pixar films. This film hit just the right mix of nostalgia and closure.
086571701X|5.0|This book is an eye-opener on statistics in our world and how beneficial aquaponic systems can be in every home.  Not only does it offer past comparisons in water usage globally through standard farm methods, but it also spells out the variables involved with future global droughts, food shortages, and severe climate changes that have an impact on the supply and demand for food production.  Written by someone who has opted for a very organic way of life by raising her own farm animals and conserving energy, this comes from an experienced individual who knows exactly what she's talking about.  I can see how aquaponics may become a future requirement in every home throughout the world to provide adequate food and reduce the impact man is having on our fragile world and nature in general.  I highly, highly recommend this book to everyone who cares about the future of this world, a possible upcoming food and water crisis, and the ecological footprint we are leaving behind.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I don't care for remakes and this was doubly ensured when I saw the remake to Carpenter's original for &#34;The Fog&#34;.  Don't waste your time or money, because a true classic will always be the best.  You can't make the best any better.  This film rocks!  It's a great nail-biter and well worth every penny.  Go with the biggest screen possible and a superb surround sound and you will be squirming all over the place and afraid to go to the bathroom alone.  This is a must to add to your classic cult collection, especially if you are a Carpenter fan like myself.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Honestly I started reading this book for a totally different reason than what made me finish it...this book definitely didn't end the way I expected it to or to say I hoped it would...all in all I liked it...for u to like this book depends on the way u take it sex, love, lust, pain, suffering, torture, happiness, are some of the many feeling u get from this book and realizing that everyone's past has a part in the person they turn out to be. Well, on to the second book of the trilogy.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Carpenter is a class act in himself, but he never disappoints me.  This was a superb rendition of Stephen King's novel and very well done.  The acting was excellent and Keith Gordon truly outdid himself as Arnie Cunningham who undergoes a fantastic character arc from geeky teenager to a possessed psycho maniac obsessed with Christine, the car from hell.  Amazing special effects with a 'tight' storyline, this film takes the viewer on one heckuva roller-coaster ride.
B00015YVD6|5.0|Would you really call this a 'classic'? I would. I grew up on this movie and everytime I watch it as I get older, I pick up on new things (as far as themes, emotional traits, comic relief etc) that keeps this from getting old or boring. I'm so glad I was able to get the 20th anni DVD and see the behind-the-scenes and commentary. If you love mermaids, you'd love this story.
B00009AOBI|5.0|Like so many tragedy films based on life's unexpected twists, this one truly touches your heart as a boy endears everyone with his likeable personality despite a horrible facial affliction similar to Elephantitis.  Eric Stoltz did a phenomenal job in this challenging role, and Cher performed flawlessly.  Set in the early 70s, based on a biker's lifestyle and a mother's constant struggle with drugs, the film portrays the many difficulties a single mother faced during that era despite her addictive love for a son plagued with a horrible disfigurement and her effort to give him as normal of a life as possible with a future full of hope to look forward to.  Excellent film and another classic well worth purchasing!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|we love this game!its very fun.and all kids can play it.it fun and its free.you have to get it.its amazing and very fun
B000ASATZ8|4.0|Tremors is great!  I love it!  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are fantastic side-kicks offering great gut-busting one-liners throughout.  I don't care for sequels but this was the better price in lieu of buying the original Tremors.  If you like sequels this would be an additional plus but I cannot give you a review on them so you will have to take your chances.  My thought is I've only seen two film sequels I've ever liked, so unless these are the exception to the rule--good luck.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|rocking cool I like I hallways want a horse and I do I love this vane every change I get I will this games
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The book was good with lots of surprises.  Couldn't wait to get back to it and thought the tenderness between the two characters was refreshing.
0765325950|1.0|Here's 20 words about the product.  Not gonna buy it. Not gonna buy it. Not gonna buy it. Not gonna buy it.  In fact, I may stop buying TOR books altogether.  Not having Memory of Lifht available on Kindle or in any digital format as soon as it is published is a boneheaded move as you just angered a large part of your customer base.  I know a lot of us who won't bother with this now ... or ever.  Not surprised though as obviously TOR doesn't really care as much about providing a good experience for customers as they do for emptying our wallets.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Can you give more than 5 stars? Because I really, really want to give this book like all the stars in the sky!!<br />Hopeless is heart wrenching, heavy, intense, and beautiful. I felt a weight on my chest and a pounding in my head for most of this book, not to mention the tears shed during the last eh, 30% of the book or so. Sky was such a strong, beautiful character who learns all the secrets of a past she doesn't even know exists until a person from her past enters her life again. As the puzzle pieces fall in to place, everything she believes about her life is a lie. Holder is obviously very swoon worthy, but more than that he is the hero and the pillar of strength by Sky's side through everything.<br />I have loved every book I've read by Colleen Hoover. She manages to create such strong feelings and emotions and a deep connection to her characters that you can't help but fall in love with them all almost immediately. Even though I experienced so many negative reactions during this book, I was still left to feel very hopeful for the futures of the characters rather than hopeless.<br />The only thing I wish I knew more about was Six! I loved her so much but I want to know why she was the way she was and that there is someone out there for her. Maybe we will get her story in the future...one can hope!<br />Just amazing!! WOW!! Awesome!! Did I say amamzing?!?!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved all three books in the Hunger games series.  This one was not quite as good as the first, but still a good read.
B00A3ATW4M|4.0|Really enjoyed this sound track- easy to listen to while scrapbooking and doing chores around the house. I would recommend
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|The most awesome movie ever!!! Its romantic and sad, but happy and funny, you will love it!!! You will forget that Emma Watson is Hermanie from Harry Potter and just see her as the character she plays!!!
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|I try to purchase all the glee albums as they come out and I missed this one. Finally got it and loved the sentimental feel of the songs
B0076DELIG|5.0|Mysterys are my favorite reads. I enjoy Connelly style. I would recommend this to people that like mysterious.4 stars great
1468179993|5.0|TED talks are a unique and compelling form of communication and presentation, something we need more of in this attention starved world.  Jeremey Donovan provides a great summary, discussion and set of ideas to help create better presentations.  While Donovan's focus is TED talks, the tools, practices and advice can apply to anyone and any presentation situation.<br /><br />Highly recommended for experienced and new speakers as a great tool and support for thinking through a presentation that has impact.  Some of the advice is unique to TED talks as opposed to traditional business presentations, but its all solid advice that help you be a better speaker.<br /><br />The book at 106 pages makes it readily accessible for even the busiest of executives.  A great way to get the best value from this book is to sketch out your ideas in the book, the idea, stories, etc as it really helps bring the ideas out and make them real.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I truly enjoy this program.  I like that it is not filled with vulgarity, murders, sex and the like.  I can let my kids watch.<br /><br />I find the all the characters engaging.  My favorite upstairs in Dowager Lady Grantham and Edith.  Downstairs, they are all great.  Please keep this one on the air.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Although quite gory, this movie is very engrossing and &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34;. Highly recommended, especially if you like post apocolyptic.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|I purchased this kit as I figured it would be a cool addition to my desk at work (I was right) and built it in one sitting.  I just dumped all of the pieces out figuring \\"Hey, I'll relive my childhood by digging for Legos like I used to do when I was young!\\" (I'm 32).  I would HIGHLY suggest sorting by color right off the bat, that will save you tons of time.<br /><br />The instructions are ok but sometimes the colors really are difficult to tell apart (black vs. dark gray vs. gray vs. white).  Once I was all done I was shorted 3 pieces and had about a dozen extras.  I logged in to the Lego website under support, entered the kit number and they are sending me the pieces at no cost.<br /><br />Aside from my minor issues with the missing pieces, I had fun building it and dispite the cost I would recommend it to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I always stayed away from this game in the arcade because it was hard to win. This version is a lot more fun and the coins regenerate pretty quick even though I don't get to play that often. It is a lot easier to win a prize and I can sell it back for more coins so I can keep playing. It has also helped with the strategy of pushing the coins to achieve what I want to win. Overall fun game.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|great episode. Was a lot of fun, laughed a lot. Howe  ver, image quality not great. Image is blurry at times.  But good for price. Recommend watching in HD.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Interesting, exciting, provocative and down right entertaining. This could be happening in today's world! I find the series thought provoking.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is a really unique game that is trickier than you think it will be.  But it isn't so hard that it's impossible just tricky and clever!!  Worth the price for sure.
6305428050|5.0|One of my FAVORITE movies of all times.  If you're an 80s baby, then this is DEFINITELY the movie for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another wonderful story by Nicholas Sparks. I can't wait for the movie. Realized after a few chapters in that I had read the book a few years ago.
B000002VSN|5.0|I LOVE this album and how Whitney puts her heart and soul singing for the Lord.  Now, she's singing in his choir.  I accidentally ran into &#34;He's All Over Me&#34; and LOVE that song.  Not a bad track on the album.  Thanks!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loved it when he was a little boy. He loves it!
B0011Z32KI|5.0|He is great I love to hear him sing I just love the old songs.I can listen to him all day
B00004YA66|5.0|Surprised this movie didn't get more notariety....such a GREAT flick....has that travel thru time sorta thing going on, with a complex plot....very eerie but in a very cool way!
1451695195|5.0|I especially recommend this book to anyone who finds him/herself in a health threatened condition. The ground we walk on every day now is but ever shifting sand, that of our future, stable rock.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Great book, looking forward to reading the next two.  Would recommend highly if you like mysteries this is for you.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The whole Fifty Shades trilogy somehow sucked me in, even though I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. The series is engaging to me because it's a chance to see a way of life that is completely foreign to me. I was intrigued that there are couples, married couples in fact, who are so focused on bondage. It was also intriguing that through all of Christian Grey's craziness that Ana still was able to stick it out and help him find a happy medium with his lifestyle. Overall, though, the books are very unrealistic and you can really tell that they are written by a Brit. I live in Seattle and some of the Seattle facts were incorrect, so that was a bit surprising.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I had recently bought for my Christmas and birthday present for myself an mini iPad.  was really disappointed that I couldn't get my facebook game's on it.  I was thinking that iMac changed, and was able to get flash player.  boy I was wrong.  so I took it back to them and they gave me my money back and then ordered your kindle fire.  I simply love it, just have to get used to it.  normally a iMac person.  your kindle is fun, I did buy some apps for it, have them saved on my iMac pc.  wish I could get them on the kindle now.

B00AAZSH0U|5.0|This is a wonderful rhyming book that children love.  Boynton never fails and her work is timeless. I am on my third generation with this book.
B004SKLD9A|4.0|Somewhat predictable but engaging. Apart from the fantasy gun fights… it’s a believable tail.  Can you imagine any government trying to deceive control the population through imperial edict and any questioning of authority is completely dismissed and addressed through violence… much less through chemically manipulating emotions?
030759565X|5.0|I like this cookbook because the recipes I have tried so far have all been delicious.  In addition the recipes are not long and time consuming.  The author makes it plain that it is ok to substitute ingredients if you don't have what the recipe calls for.  For example, the muffin recipe that calls for fresh prune plums:  you can easily subsitiute dried prunes for the fresh plums and you can substitute a mixture of dried prunes and dried cranberries .  The muffins always are delicious.<br />The vegetarian entree chapter has some very delicious recipes in it, as does the chapter on vegetables.  I am cooking my way through this cookbook and the recipes almost always delight me and my husband.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is great for kids and adults too!!  Entertaining and of great value for the price of the DVD.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you are looking for a game that will give you a challenge and keep you entertain for hours. Give this app a try
0375826742|4.0|I like The books , but objected to paying customs duty charges on top of postage & packing , which was already split into different deliverys.
0345803493|5.0|Book Two was great. When I received it, I was anxious to continue reading the story line and how detailed the second book is. Great!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think its a very good app. I wasn't a big fan of temple run until I player this game. now that I have I cant stop playing it
0345803485|5.0|Book One was amazing. When I received it, I was excited to read. I did not think that I would be so involved into the book. Great!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This app is definitely worth it. It's exactly the quality I would expect from big fish games. Looks like there might be a sequel too!
0345803507|4.0|Book Three was &#34;Ok.&#34; When I received it, I was anxious to continue reading the story line. However, I was not pleased at all on how the storyline was ending towards the end of the book, way too fast. I received all three books quick and loved the Trilogy. Great!
B00AEFXKUI|5.0|The best movie of all time in my opinion! I love this show and it one all kinds of Academy Awards, plus its a true story which makes it more intriguing.
B0051UH6W4|5.0|It skips back and forth between timelines. Multiple tragedies involving the same family unfold right in front of your eyes. It's as if a car accident is taking place in slow motion and you can't look away.<br /><br />Arundathi Roy's vocabulary and way of describing emotions is breathtaking.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is such a heart warming Christmas movie. The DVD was a great price and in great condition. I would recommend this movie to everyone!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent script and superior acting.  Characters continue to grow and develop.  Continuity is well done and well paced.  Exploration of the sociological realities of the time are well researched and presented.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. Really funny! Blu-ray was a great price and in great condition
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I'm not sure why this movie got so many negative reviews...  it really is an excellent story.  Action, Adventure, Love, Twists, Comedy, Great Scenery (although not accurate in terms of what we know about Mars)...  I mean I could see some complaints about some slow spots, but I didn't really mind.  I considered it plot development.  Anyhow, watch it for yourself.  It's worth it!
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|When I saw the commercials I expected a modern version of the original but i was wrong, it looks like a 80-90s film done in the 80-90s, was i entertained yes, would i watch it again no, would i buy it NO,
B001H9JBW6|4.0|It's 2008, and we're in the high mountain-desert on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. There are no trees. There are not even bushes. Just some yellow-green grass that looks like it would rather be someplace else. It's the Killi Faizo medical refugee camp, a gathering of white tents arranged in rows in the middle of nowhere. A Britisher gets into his Land Rover and drives out of the camp. Over the next hill, a man releases a hawk. A special hawk, this one is carrying a miniature video camera.<br /><br />Cut to London, where a woman is awakened from her sleep by a phone call. It is a video. The man in the Land Rover is blown to bits as his vehicle hits a land mine.<br /><br />An interesting and mysterious beginning to &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;. Mysterious because you don't know how the man with the hawk knew that the Land Rover was going to hit a land mine.<br /><br />Stephen Ezard travels back to England for the funeral of the man in the Land Rover, who was his brother Michael. Stephen is a mildly-misanthropic mathematical genius. He's been holed up in China, not communicating with the outside world. London today has some surprises for him. Due to terrorist attacks, a lot has changed. Retinal scans in the airport. Identity cards. Police in body armor patrol London in bands of five. Camera monitors on every street corner, in every store, even in the houses.<br /><br />A limo picks Stephen up at the airport and he asks the driver to go faster because he's late for the funeral.<br />The driver replies, &quot;Oh, I'm afraid we don't have clearance to break monitored speed, Sir.&quot;<br />&quot;Monitored speed?  I've been away, about 4 years.&quot;<br />&quot;You'll be noticing the changes then, Sir.&quot;<br /><br />At Michael's apartment, Stephen has more surprises.<br />1) There's a sick woman with an IV in the bedroom<br />2) Michael had a wife, Yasim, a doctor who met Michael in refugee camp<br /><br />&quot;The Last Enemy&quot;, in an original script by Peter Barry, at first seems just a cautionary tale about giving up your rights to the state in return, you hope, for protection against terrorism. Where do you draw the line?  For England in this series, the line may be the passage or not passage of T.I.A.  Total Information Awareness, according to the developers, is &quot;the entire U.K. in one database, birth to death, day to day, up to date and in real time. ... Absolute surveillance.&quot;<br /><br />But there is more than that going on. Why does Yasim hide the sick woman's body when she dies? Why are murders following Yasim and Stephen? What happens when the powers that be want to test an ultimate weapon, any way they can?<br /><br />There is a reason why the tagline for this mini-series is<br />&quot;Tomorrow Is Nearer Than You Think...&quot;<br /><br />You don't find out where the title, &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;, comes from until almost the very last words spoken. It reminded me of when, many years ago, I read George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, immediately followed by reading Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;. I ended up liking &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; better, because the end leaves you with hope. Unlike the ending of &quot;1984&quot;, Bradbury lets you believe that there is a chance the world could change.<br /><br />Wait until the last scenes of &quot;The Last Enemy&quot;, and decide if there is hope... or not.<br /><br />This miniseries, which was shown on Masterpiece Theater in the U.S., has 5 episodes. There are 2 DVD's, with a total screen time of 285 minutes. It can be watched in widescreen.

B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a great album! Howard Shore never fails to impress.<br />The price was decent as well. I saw this album in stores selling for much more than I paid for it.
0143120255|4.0|I bought this for my Dad who lives in New York and is going to Paris.  The pictures are graphic and interesting, the comparisons are clever.  There is a larger, more expensive version of this book, which might have made a better gift, as this one is a little small to be a coffee table book.
B005LAII80|4.0|3d was awesome. Some good action scenes and lots of blood. Good enough for an action movie.  It was missing Stallone though. Even a cameo would have been nice
B0011UJMK2|4.0|Great book . At first it was really slow but by the middle of the book I couldn't put it down. Can't wait to finish the trilogy
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Interesting variety of play for a HO game. It kept me involved and playing. One little glitch when I could not go back. But good
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The music from Les Miserables has always stuck after a viewing. Having the soundtrack let me hear them as sung by the performers again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My little one loves this game. Some parts are entertaining for adults and the simple horse maintenance is perfect for kids. My only complaint is that you cant name your horse.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I bought these and G19 at the same time. I've pretty much switched from Razer peripherals to Logitech in a single week. The mouse and keyboard are an awkward transition, but the headphones are a different story. They are very well made, and feature rich.<br /><br />nice<br />That little light on the end of the mic letting you know its muted.<br />volume control on the left ear.<br />Very nice range<br />includes a usb hub<br /><br />not so nice<br />the recessed mini-usb power plug is a pain.
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|Of course we loved it - how could you NOT love that little wiggly, romping, so anxious to please, mutt?  We thoroughly enjoyed it - it was sad at points, but sometimes you gotta get the emotions moving to get the point, right?<br />The only negative must have been our slow internet.  I felt at times that the sound was off, or mushy.<br />I had wanted to watch it since I saw it advertised, though, and it did not disappoint!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the game but the negative gem things are annoying especially when I didn't do anything. Good game though
B004JMY312|5.0|Our daughter works on a cruise ship, and a couple of her friends and herself decided to dress up and perform as the gals in Hocus Pocus for their crew Hallowe'en party.  My husband and I would have loved to be there and see it, but couldn't, so we did the next best thing.  We watched the movie.  :-)

B0049P1VHS|5.0|We had been watching The Walking Dead since the beginning, but our daughter and boyfriend hadn't seen it.  We decided to introduce them by getting them the first DVD for Christmas.  They work on a cruise ship and don't have access to rental movies and so forth.  They were so ravenous after seeing the first season, that they started a hunt around the ship to find someone - anyone, who might have Season 2!  Needless to say, they loved it.  :-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this. game is free and has 132 games. this I can not believe. so awesome who doesn't like this is. a. fool
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is better than the first temple run. It is ten times better with the rope vines and mine carts. You have to get this if you like the first temple run.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|He is cuter then the picture shows. I would recommend him for any Grandma who has a little one that loves<br />monkeys...or any cute animal. Good quality too!
1452110581|5.0|This caught the spirit of being a cat or a cat owner to the T. I gave it as a Christmas present, it is also a very pretty book for display for those of us with a sense of humor when we decorate the house.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Longer than cord supplied woth kindle. Seems more durable than original or preciously purchased cords, this is the third cord I have purchased. Wish it came in black
1449410243|5.0|Sad to say, I know a cat who knows a cat who was the inspiration for this book. This is a good survival guide for cat owners.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Thought it was more for teenager than adult but good story line and well written. Good subject matter and held my attention
B005XI9456|5.0|I thought he did a great job on this album overall. I like the way he has a unique voice that can be dynamic enough to sound pop when he wants to, R&B when he wants to, and modern Country as well. My only critique is the song he did with Mariah Carey, it just sends like her old version with his voice recording over it, they definitely don't sound like they came together and &#34;re-performed&#34; it. I wish they would have so that it have sounded a bit more like a duet and less like a someone singing to the instrumental to the old song. The best songs are &#34;Fa La La&#34; f/ Boys II Men, &#34;Mistletoe,&#34; &#34;Christmas Eve,&#34; &#34;All I Want Is You,&#34; and &#34;Home This Christmas&#34; f/ the Band Perry.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|The Best of Me was a good read.  It kept me guessing thorough out the book.  The ending had an unexpected twist. I would have preferred a different one, however.  I always enjoy Sparks books.  Look forward to the next!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love dry drama!!! The Characters are so well written. I wait all week to see what they are going to do. They never do What I think they will. I love it
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I record vocals for fun, so upgrading to this was exactly want i was looking for.<br /><br />The two output feature was something i was looking for.<br />I can plug my speakers and headphones in at the same time and adjust the volume for each one independently.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Phantom power.<br />2 Guitar/Mic input.<br />The light indicator for volume levels.<br />Direct monitoring for zero-latency<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't think of any at the moment.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While book 2 was a cliff-hanger, book 3 finished the story and wrapped things up nice and tidy.  Overall, a surprisingly good read.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it can not wait for the 3rd book to come out wish i could meet a guy like gideon
030758836X|1.0|This book made me stand up and take notice how this trash made the NY Times best seller list.<br />What were they thinking that would even give this book the tiniest chance of making the \\"list\\".  From now on, I will find out more about the book, than assuming the \\"NY best seller\\" know good books.<br />Very disappointing.
B007SGM084|5.0|books were great wish they would keep going with the same books the 3 were to short  would love to see what would happen with the rest of the people
B00AJAFNIA|4.0|The game pulls you in fast and before you know the hours have flown by!!!!!!  And it is for children and adults. (59 yrs young!!!) :-)  The game play was smooth at first then it started lagging and finally locked up my Kindle fire, after rebooting it's running smoothly again but if it lock up again it's toast. KF takes forever to reboot!!!!! Not worth it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book was great sylvia day is now the best author i hope we get more books like this so i can read them
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a really great game! Very impressed on how much they improved, but sometimes the game will glitch and you die and if you try to use save me it will crash and send you back to your homepage. But overall it's AWESOME!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is so easy to use.  My only complaint is it asks me every time what kind I want.  Replay, winnable, random; I wish there was a way to set my preference and maybe have a button on the playing field for replay.  Also, too many commercials.
B00A0SKFLG|5.0|This was a great movie! I like any kind of movies that takes place in the future! I like how there was also a love story to the movie also!
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Amazon offered a great price for this album when it first came out and I am loving every song on it. I always check with amazon first before I buy anywhere else.
B001N9BGGY|5.0|I liked the first movie a lot (before sunrise).  Wanted to find out what happened next.<br />Now I know.<br /><br />I still think that Celine is much more interesting than Jesse.<br />We'll see what happens next in &#34;Before Midnight&#34;.  Due out this year.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is one of the series that I enjoy reading greatly. I am already on my third book and I started this series a week or so ago. These books pull you in and make you keep reading<br /> People of all ages can enjoy these books.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I've not been reading novels much over the years. I decided to get back into that and this was the perfect book to whet my appetite. Since reading Zeero Day I've started his Camel club series.  Goood Stuff
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|This movie inspired me to get back into performing. It great. I quote it on a daily basis. Sexy man sweat.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I liked the book but was surprised by it's main theme &#34;spouse abuse&#34;.  Found myself skimming some of the descriptive stuff after awhile to get to the story line.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the best book out of them all. I am so glad i ought this book, and for $5 cheaper, what a great steal
B009LUBA7M|2.0|I really do want to like this Mika output, having fallen in love with all of his previous output, but I can't.  Historically Mika can pump out every tune that is instantly toe-tappingly good.  This album, while playing it over and over I still can't hum one.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|this movie was more hype than action, very slow in some parts and lacked story line. it was gambling on showing some male parts to desperate women willing to pay for it
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Being someone that has been to see this show live in a number of locations, including the West End, this blu-ray captures the energy perfectly.  The whole show is played out with extreme heart thumbing passion that you will want to crank up the volume to feel the energy.<br /><br />Then as soon as its all over, it starts again!  Well not quite, but the original show cast come out, and sing key songs with their modern counterparts and it is wonderful to hear the original voices with the new.  Fantastic.<br /><br />Blu-Ray delivers a crisp sound and a beautiful image to accompany this musical delight.
0451232852|5.0|I was desperate to find a good book, and I finally found one. FALL OF GIANTS is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I have been so disappointed lately in contemporary so-called thrillers, with cardboard characters and see-through plots, that I feared I would not find a book worthy of the time it took to read it. FALL OF GIANTS is worth the time. In fact, I have already bought the second installment, WINTER OF THE WORLD. This sweeping saga will hold your attention and make you want to find out what happens next. I highly recommend it.
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I received a Kindle Fire for Christmas without a cover.  I wanted to be able to carry it with me but also use it in the kitchen.  This does both VERY well!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book takes your heart away.  It has happy parts, but there are moments you want to cry.  And that is what I love about this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game has potential unlike the first one.  Temple run surprised me and also others.  But at some points there are some weird camera views. I still give it give stars.
B007AJFSJW|5.0|Krugman, in his book End This Depression Now, sets forth a well researched way to address the recent and current recession which seems to go against what most politicians and pundits are recommending as the way to deal with our econmic issues.  He is both insigthful and stimulating as he supports his approach with the significant lessons of history and the great depression.  The irony is that he is often dismissed and the tragedy is that he is too often ignored.  There is a way out, and he makes a cogent case for his recommadations.  Encouraging that something can be done.  Discouraging that his advice is too often dismissed.  You will look on our current situation with new and hopeful eyes after reading this book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely amazing!! One of the best stories I've read in a long time. I can't wait to read more books from this Author!
B009O07NDY|4.0|I am a big fan of the movie franchise and Tolkeins' writings. My mind immediately compared &#34;The Fellowship of The Ring&#34;  and &#34;The Hobbit&#34; soundtracks as I was watching the film due to the familiar themes from both.They are tied together nicely. It is immediately apparent that this is Howard Shore's work. I  gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I would have liked to have heard the complete &#34;Dwarves' lament  for the Misty Mountains&#34; the poem from the novel performed and included in the soundtrack.  I highly recommend this to every fan of the author, films or composer. The sound is crisp and clear, and you cannot go wrong with the London Philharmonic.<br />Cheers!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is the best adventure game I have seen for the Kindle Fire. Great puzzles, beautiful graphics, challenging, and hints if needed, etc. Fire Maple seems to be the top producer of adventure games and I will look for them in the future.
0670024813|4.0|I enjoyed reading geographer Jared Diamond's third book about human history and evolution; the World Until Yesterday. The book is a refreshing Hobbsean perspective on early human societies from outside of anthropology. I knew that Pat Putnam stated the number 1 and 2 causes of death for Mbuti pygmies were falling from trees and having trees fall on them. I was unaware that trees were a primary source of death for many foraging people (especially those living in forests). Table 8.1 (p. 279) As a cultural anthropologist I was surprised to see Diamond using the Bolivian Siriono as one of his models for band or tribal people.  Alan Holmberg's 1950 ethnography, Nomads of the Long Bow, (Smithsonian Institution Institute of Social Anthropology Publication No. 10), states on page 8; \\"The Siriono are an anomaly in eastern Bolivia.  Widely scattered in of isolated pockets of forest land, with culture strikingly backward and in contrast to that of their neighbors, they are probably a remnant of an ancient population that was exterminated, absorbed, or engulfed by more civilized neighbors.\\" If Holmberg was right then the Siriono are not a accurate metaphor for people living unencumbered by the power of chiefdoms and states, which Diamond suggests provide modern folks with peace.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|I love the new way they tell an old tale. It is a mystery that keeps you guessing amd the scenery is just beautiful.  This is a great movie, a marvelous yarn with spins to keep you intrigued till the end. I recommed this movie.

0446547646|3.0|I've read every one of Spark's books, and I think this is the first that disappointed me. The writing didn't flow as well as his others, and the story seemed forced. I wouldn't recommend this book to friends to read, unless they were determined to read every book Nicholas Sparks has ever written. He's done better...

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|'Downton Abbey' (2010-present) is the outstanding period drama and British-American production created by Julian Fellowes.<br /><br />Unlike AMC's 'Mad Men,' which also took America by storm a little at a time, and also largely by word of mouth, 'Downton Abbey,' which considers Edwardian England, the Great War, and its aftermath, was predominantly created by native British citizens, and carefully analyzes the period it covers without wholly trashing it, as 'Mad Men' subtly and unsubtly does 1960s America on an episode-by-episode basis.<br /><br />In an era of exploitive programs like 'American Horror Story,' which is as extreme as anything ever produced for television, and which regularly traffics in horrific amputations, sadomasochism, genetic deformity, and torture, it is wonderful to discover a series like 'Downton Abbey,' which proves, among other points, that adults everywhere are absolutely starved for intelligent, ethical, and mature dramatic fare, such as was regularly produced in decades past on both sides of the Atlantic, especially in film.<br /><br />Opening in 1912, 'Downton Abbey' is the story of the aristocratic and genuinely noble Crawley family, who live in contented luxury at Downton Abbey, their immense Yorkshire estate, and of the lives of their multitude of servants, who the Crawleys treat with humanity, decency, and respect.<br /><br />Their fairly idyllic lifestyle is rattled by the loss of the family heirs on the Titanic, and then the coming of the Great War, which turns Britain and its social traditions upside down in a thousand painful ways.<br /><br />What makes 'Downton Abbey' almost radical in this age is that it refuses to denigrate the Edwardian aristocracy it examines. While both Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham (Maggie Smith) and American-born Lady Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern) are initially shown to be somewhat priggish and short-sighted, one of the themes of the program is the dual nature of most men.<br /><br />Thus, homosexual footman Thomas (Rob James-Collier) is, along with lady's maid Miss O'Brien (Siobhan Finneran), initially something of a villain, but as the series progresses, even sociopathic Thomas is shown to have, or to develop, a good side.<br /><br />Likewise, overlooked middle sister Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael) foolishly betrays her elder sister, Mary (Michelle Dockery), but this action is shown to be a lapse, if still a serious one, in an otherwise good personal character.<br /><br />As a whole, 'Downton Abbey' believes in the predominantly ethical and decent nature of man. As such, it depicts both the aristocrat and the 'common' working man, such as Christ figure and valet John Bates (Brendon Coyle, whose performance dominates the first season), as capable of integrity, empathy, courage, nobility of purpose, and basic human goodness in all its forms.<br /><br />It is this vision of mankind that gives 'Downton Abbey' its power.<br /><br />Though the series has the occasional weak treatment of a plot thread--such as dignified butler Carson (Jim Carter) being revealed to have once been a vaudeville performer or the rather unconvincing return of an heir thought dead, 'Downton Abbey' usually steers clear, not of soap opera cliches unfortunately, but of the standard melodramatic treatment of them when they do appear.<br /><br />For 'Downton Abbey' to continue to thrive creatively, however, the writing has to remain focused primarily on the historical period, and continue to provide viewers with 'a window into the past' instead of becoming bogged down too heavily in the lives of the characters themselves. By Season Three, for example, the lame and long-suffering Bates has been put through so many sensational reversals of fortune that such events no longer seem very credible, and audience sympathy for the character wanes considerably.<br /><br />In Season One, the various characters appeared largely to represent objective principles as much as they were presented as three-dimensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect. Thankfully, by the fifth episode and following, the writing is the best it has been since the first season.<br /><br />'Downton Abbey,' in its worldwide success, should not be playing to its audience, but going its own way and forcing the viewer to make all the effort necessary to follow it.<br /><br />Still, 'Downton Abbey' remains outstanding on almost every level, from the writing, cinematography, set design, costuming, and score to the brilliant acting by Hugh Bonneville as the Crawley family patriarch, Dan Stevens as heir presumptive Matthew Crawley and Smith, McGovern, Dockery, Coyle, and well over a dozen others, 'Downton Abbey' sets a new standard for 21st century television, and, by extension, asks us to reconsider the lives we lead and the society we support today.<br /><br />All students of Edwardian England, of Rupert Brooke, Vita Sackville-West, Kenneth Grahame, J. M. Barrie, the Sitwells and others will admire and deeply appreciate this intelligent, thoughtful, and moving series.imensional human beings; in the opening episodes of Season Three, however, the same characters are instead depicted strictly in human terms, and the writing is far more self-conscious in every respect.

B003Y5H574|5.0|I usually do not like romantic comedies.  This one, however, I enjoy quite a bit.  It is sexy and fun at the same time.  You feel sorry for Steve's character and can relate with him (even though I did not go through what happened).<br /><br />There is a nice plot twist that slaps you in the face and leaves you stunned.  That is all I will say.

B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Maybe it is because I first saw this in the theater in Cape Town, with people who lived it, but this has become one of my favorite movies. A fictional story with the same plot line would have been dismissed as ridiculous.  Instead, we get to watch a true story about a remarkable and humble man. I happened to be in South Africa when it premiered. To get to the theater, I drove along the coastal highway shown in the opening scene. My companions knew every word of the songs and the audience sang along.  After the movie, they told stories to rival any from the film itself. I rarely see movies in the theater and almost never go twice. I went twice to see this one and have waited eagerly for the DVD.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very good!  I just love my kindle fire more.  To have the calculator right there, it's the convenience and the attractiveness that makes people go,WOW!

This movie nails that on the head too!

B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It's very evident to me that while Tom Clancy may have designed to overview and had a small hand in editing, this book is very different in style and tempo from previous works. Mark Greaney is a talented writer but the characters lack the depth and complexity that I have come to love in Clancy previous works. Having said that, it's still a good read and advances Jack Junior's story line and will continue to follow his exploits in future works.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love it and the color really makes it pop out. I take it where ever I go. it's a must!!!!
B005F82X48|5.0|Hard rock bands, be they Christian or mainstream, are generally fronted by guys. Icon For Hire's Ariel proves that women can rock it just as well as the guys. &#34;Scripted&#34; delivers passion, authentic lyrics and hard-hitting music that will appeal to your inner head banger in a big way.

B007H9B8FS|5.0|Great CD, so glad to hear from Garbage again!  Some good hard driving tunes to drive your gym workout.  Just overall a great album!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Great fun read! Nice to read something different than what i normally go for! Recommended for anyone who wants a fun change of pace -
B0018TLRTK|5.0|It you don't own any Billy Idol, but want to have some of his tunes in your library, this CD will fit the bill for your collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the best series for young adults that has come out in a while.  It is miles better than Harry Potter, anyway.  I also thought it was good as a dystopian science fiction novel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Wish there was more!!! Loved the suspicion and the romance. I couldnt put the books down. I have recommended to almost everyone I know. The books had me on edge wondering what could happen next and how Jack was going to sabbatoge Christian and how he knew him. Loved 50 shades and I could read all over again!!!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|No spoilers, but the ending to this book was VERY disappointing.  Just imagine the most ridiculous way The Hunger Games trilogy could end, and that's probably it.
B0000B1OFL|5.0|this movie is right on i love all of the  action and drama of this movie saw it on cable and had to have it
B003O86FMW|4.0|Someone told me that this book was not as good as the first Hunger Games book, but I thought it was OK.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|After battling 2 days trying to install another security program on my Kindle Fire; it was a pleasure to download/install Avast in under 1 minute!! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!  ;-D
B00005NIE1|5.0|I really just enjoyed this product and everything about it in every unique way possible that I can't even start to imagine
B008HK3XU4|3.0|I can't figure out how to get it to stand up.  It is a nice cover but that is all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love this game. it keeps my animal obsession at a minimum. it makes sure I don't bring anymore home. I have way too many and no room for a real horse.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|Pay the money we need more of these games for the Kindle. Runs smooth, amazing graphics and hours of old school entertainment. I say bring all of FF 1-9 on.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|What can I say? I can never go wrong using this application...it makes for a very good reference application. Two thumbs up!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great book- I read it in a day. It was sad but at the same time uplifting and entertaining. Very easy read and relatable to anyone who has been through a hard time. My only complaint was that the ending was a little abrupt and fulfilling.
1616550414|5.0|This is THE best book ever written.<br />I wish that they spent a little less time on Skyward Sword, as I haven't played it yet, but I love the fact that Nintendo released the OFFICIAL timeline.<br /><br />The book is divided into 4 sections<br /><br />1. Skyward Sword Concept Art<br />2. Timeline/ History of Hyrule<br />3. Concept Art For Other Games<br />4. Skyward Sword Manga (starts at back cover, as manga reads right to left).<br /><br />Basically, if you have practically changed your religion to believe in the goddesses and the Triforce, this is your bible.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I have been an Emmy Rossum fan since she appeared in the 2004 film version of Phantom of the Opera.  I was very impressed that at only 16, she was able to sing the highly demanding leading role of Christine.  I own and enjoy her first CD, Inside Out, so when I heard she was working on a new CD, I started following all the press and info she shares with her fans about her projects.  I heard a few snippets of tracks from Sentimental Journey via Emmy's facebook page and immediately purchased the album.  Like Emmy, I grew up on the great Standards from my parent's record collection, so I have a real appreciation of this genre.  Sentimental Journey features songs originally recorded by artists from an era gone by, but while she preserves some of that \\"oldtimey\\" sound of the originals, Emmy's interpretation of these songs imbues them with a freshness that will likely appeal to her younger fans as well as nostalgia buffs.  She has a surprisingly wide vocal range with a very well developed warm, lower register, and is able to transition the mood from sultry, to melancholy, to upbeat and bubbly.  I also enjoyed the fact that her vocals were neither overproduced or annoyingly autotuned.  Her performance of these songs is nuanced and natural.  There is not an overabundance of reverb used here, and her voice at times, with its flaws and charm, sounds as if she is sitting right next to you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app to pass the time once in a while.  Like the different game options and the option to teach you how to win.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having the Holy Bible on my Kindle and I love this app because of its features such as the daily plans you can choose from! The apps easy to use and I looove it!
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I'm kind of bummed we paid to rent this.  It wasn't worth the $.  It was ok, but I won't be watching it again.
B008Y5OW20|5.0|Jeff Lynne pays homage to the music he loved growing up. He puts his personal E.L.O. touch on the classic songs he covers.Providing all the vocals and instrumentation himself. The only negative about thi disc is that it checks at about  28 minutes.But it is beautifully done. A thrill to here new music for E.L.O. fans
B008ZOHCKE|1.0|nearly useless.  does not provide adequate space for easy notes.  Advertising on free version incredibly intrusive.  Might be usable on a larger platform, but I like the size of Kindle.
0765325950|5.0|I am amazed at the number of one star reviews for this book.  My guess is that after such a long series, it would be almost impossible to write an ending that would be satisfying to everyone, unless that ending consumed another 10,000 pages of writing.  Sanderson picked a small number of plot threads to wrap up in detail; many were done quickly; and others not at all.  So this leaves many readers disappointed.  For myself, I thought it rated 4 stars, but gave it 5 to counter the ridiculous number of undeserved 1 stars.<br />The one thing I did find a little odd was the amount of time spent on Perrin, but I always did like his character so no biggie.  There were enough surprises throughout the novel to keep me interested, and upon finishing the read I was pleased that it was brought to a conclusion. However, I  also found myself thinking about possible sequels recounting the various surviving character's lives afterwards, which could provide Sanderson with all the material he would ever need in his writing career.  Well, one can always hope.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Great movie! Probably one of the best I have seen. Loved the action and the romance, and the little spurts of comedy. All around a great movie, it is now my favorite movie, and this genre isn't even my cup of tea. When I went to go see it I was not expecting much, and to be honest wasn't excited about it. But, man it was a great movie and I went to see it twice. I cannot wait for it to come out. Yeah there is a lot of use of the N word, but that is how it was in those times. If you are sensitive to the N word, and lots of fighting then this probably isn't the best choice. I loved the sound track too. I wish I could buy \\"who did that to you\\" without buying the whole album though!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I felt that I learned more about the context of the first world war in The Fall of Giant than I learned about the second world war reading this book. This prevents me from giving a 5 star.
B007R41E8O|2.0|This game kept freezing and then when I'd go back in I would have to start the section I had been working on all over again. It got old really quick. Interestingly, I had actually played the sequel game Twisted Lands insomnia before this one and , I definitely liked it more. I wish I hadn't gotten this one. I might have liked it more if it hadn't kept freezing up on me. I had problems with the download, too. Twisted Lands Insomnia is/was MUCH better.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The plot was slow and they did not develop the characters well.  Also it would have helped to have referred to previous books about the history of the characters.
B00973902K|5.0|Over the summer I was a volunteer counselor at a camp for children with life threatening illnesses. My kids had various forms of Cancer. After every meal we did &#34;camp dancing&#34; where we did choreographed dances as a group to a whole slew of songs. One of these songs was &#34;Call Me Maybe.&#34; I like to think I'm pretty aware of the latest in music, but somehow I was the only person on the planet who hadn't heard this song! When I returned home from camp I started hearing the song everywhere! And every time I do I can't help but smile, picturing all of my kids and fellow counselors dancing with everything they had. :)
B000W05IL4|4.0|This is a classic Anthrax album. It always had kind of crappy production, and still does. It would be a great candidate for a remastered edition.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|works fine for what it is . could be better looking an made of nicer material but for the price its ok
B005KWL2IW|5.0|With the return of Joey Belladonna on vocals this brings back the Anthrax sound that made them one of the Big 4. I was a huge fan back in the day, and even though I liked(not loved) Armored Saint I could never get into John Bush as the singer for Anthrax. This album truly deserves all the acclaim it's getting and is a true return to form for the band. I hope they can keep Joey in the band for the long haul and we get more great albums like this out of them.
1616550414|5.0|I love everything about this book! The concept art is beautiful and finally being able to see how all the games are related is a plus!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I enjoyed Reflected in You: A Crossfire Novel more than Bared to You.  I felt the plot came to life in this book and by the end I was much less frustrated with Eva.  I think overall the characters became more real and relatable.
B0043URV5U|5.0|So many emotions, change with the music.  Thoroughly enjoyable: old and new memories.  I felt as though I rediscoved Bob Seger with these two discs.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I liked this game.  It is a good mix of hidden object-escape and brain exercise.  The map is very handy.  I hope there is a sequel.  20 word minimum.  I reached the minimum.  blah blah blab blah
0375507256|5.0|this was an amazing book and film. i had to buy the book after seeing the film. used books are just as good as new ones.
141970642X|5.0|My 10 Year old absolutely loves this book!  As long as she is happy and keeps reading books i will keep buying them!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The gameplay will be very familiar to players of the first two games. Nevertheless it has been upgraded and is very fun. There are, however, several bugs, to be expected in V1.0. None of them are showstoppers (except the one that crashes the game when you attempt to revive), but they are all very annoying. Hopefully Imangi can fix them up quickly.
B008RC72G8|4.0|What can I say, typical Johnny Depp film.  It was entertaining and funny.  Definitely will be watching this one again.
030726999X|4.0|An intreaguing story that pits a young lady against law enforcement, people she occasionally works for and the international crime element.  How she survives makes me wonder.  A few of her survivals were, well, just a bit &#34; . . . aw come on!&#34;  Still you will find the book easy to put down and then soon returning to read some more.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Well done, just believe I have seen this before.  Cross between Aliens and various other sci-fi movies.  Will probably watch it again sometime.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|When I first received my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; it came with the same USB cable, but I knew something was wrong as soon as I tried to disconnect it from my Kindle.  It was nearly impossible to take out and I actually thought it may break off inside because it was so hard.  I had to use physical force to remove it.  After this, I called Amazon customer service and explained my issue.  They sent me this and althoug it's a better fit, it still needs me to pull hard to remove it.  It has little barbs on the sides, and it seems to me like it almost needs little buttons on the side to release it.  I am still a little worried that I'll damage it, but I guess that's what the protection plan is for.  This is my 3rd Kindle and I have never had this type of issue before.  So far the product works.
B00280LYHS|4.0|This whole book was one epic battle. From the first chapter I thought this book was already going to end with all the excitement going on. Great way to end this series.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT BARGAIN PRICE  SAVED $10.00 OVER THE STORE PRICE-  EVERYTHING IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE-  SHOP HERE AND SAVE
B00395ZYVS|3.0|a fairly good read with interesting historical references to Indian culture...the plot twists and ending were somewhat formulatic though...still enjoyable
1616550414|5.0|This book is stunning.  Chock full of really cool facts and (most importantly) amazing art from the Legend of Zelda.  Definitely worth the wait.
0385522401|5.0|very well written novel with a compact time frame...interesting in that it leaves you still with questions about the deeper emotions of the characters involved...a novel that could easily be read over a weekend
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg! I love it! Read this book in a day! I literally couldn't put it down. Just as good as the first if not better. I can't wait to read the next one...but I don't want them to end! I'm gonna have to read the next one slower..lol
1594489505|5.0|this is an excellent novel that I was inspired to read after first having read The Kite Runner...I enjoyed this novel more than The Kite Runner and would highly recommend it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game EVER!!!!!!! You should totally download I might warn you if you don't like it that might be because it is kinda like temple run. With just trains
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|having followed news accounts of Jaycee's heartbreaking story, I found myself emotionally connected to her story...it was basically heartbreaking but also inspirational in Jaycee's amazing ability to adapt and overcome adversity...definitely highly recommended
B0091REZMW|4.0|I didn't get to play long enough to  rate this game.<br />So far, I like it and enjoyed playing the game.
B009RI4ZKC|4.0|Eye-candy of a movie, with a sweet storyline. Loved the way the movie was framed and shot, and the actors and script fit perfectly. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This app is  Awesome because it can tell me what or who I am thinking of. It's like... WOW haha.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Fun movie. Lots of action and easy to follow. Some sequels just rehash the previous version but his was original enough to keep you from thinking of the other movies, but added enough info from the previous story line to keep it interesting.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|This book is hilarious! I can imagine the Coen Brothers making it into a movie, possibly starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt etc.
1608871088|5.0|Beautiful, inspiring artwork! It's very carefully constructed and shows really nice concept artwork from the beginning stages of designing characters and settings to the very end. Great for aspiring and professional artists!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so much. I think people that love horses will love this you can train it for completions.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|GREEN DAY!!! ...'nough said. :-D<br />I'm a HUGE Green Day fan & this trio rocks on!<br />If you don't have all three albums... get 'em! When listened to back to back, these albums will give you hours of hard rockin' fun!
B0058VW36U|4.0|Cut the rope was fun at first but after a while it got kind of boring its not my favorite game but I don't hare it

B001W6RRFM|1.0|I bought this book under a misapprehension.  Bryson is a journalist and he is not diligent about researching his statements.  He makes statements about words in other languages.

B008NA3I30|1.0|You know you have a problem with a movie when all you care about is the quaint and picturesque locations in which the scenes are filmed. Sarah Polley's \\"Take This Waltz\\" has ideas that are intriguing. Not original but intriguing nonetheless. But just about every choice she makes, in my humble opinion of course, is the wrong one. Her casting and her characters development are horrible.  None of the characters, actors and actresses, i thought, were interesting enough (or charismatic enough...) for me to believe in their mutual attraction. Why are they so in love with each other? Even the family of Seth Rogen's character wasn't particularly enticing to me. The scenes Polley writes are boring. The result:  I just don't care about anyone. And I like slow movies with \\"normal\\" looking people, where nothing extraordinary seems to happen. \\"Another Year\\" (2011) from Mike Leigh is the perfect example.<br /><br />Michelle Williams, Seth Rogen, Luke Kirby and Sarah Silverman simply aren't special enough to ignite some kind of an emotional response on my part. And Michelle Williams might have been very pretty and sexy in \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" and \\"Drive\\", but here, I fail to see her beauty. I would have preferred a genuine good looking actress trying to look \\"normal\\" (Keira Knightley, Clair Danes, Naomie Watts, Natalie Portman, Rachel Weiz, etc...). Not a normal looking actress looking normal. I just couldn't believe the passion of the two leading man for her.<br /><br />Some of the script details are not very believable either. Michelle William's character has a strange fear of airport and that narrative detail is out of place in this kind of film. Maybe in a Wes Anderson movie. Or a Coen brother film.  Same thing with the passion of Seth Rogen's character for chicken or Luke Kirby's ways of jogging and working (by being an autorickshaw driver... in Toronto). In a offbeat comedy, where the characters are a bit caricatural, those details would be fitting. Not in a \\"serious\\" sentimental drama. I say drama cause if it's a comedy, well it's not funny. Speaking of the fact that Luke Kirby's character is an autorickshaw driver... Is that how he can offord a house like that?<br /><br />And I'm not even gonna talk about the director's choice of showing us naked women, of all ages, in a public shower.  For a long, long, long shot. Especially elderly women. Why? What was the point or message? What were we suppose to realize? Cause it's obvious  that Sarah Polley wanted to make an artistic and philosophical point with that. Some kind of a statement of life.<br /><br />I appreciate Polley's effort for trying to make something that is different. It doesn't mean that it has to be automatically good. And so, I feel that here, it's misguided and boring. Also, by wanting to be too \\"normal\\", her film is therefore well, forgettable.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I bought a tablet a while back that was not Google Play compliant - uses ICS but not a certified device.  I was surprised to see that the Kindle app worked from the start.  This opens another universe of android apps that I thought was closed.  Leaving the laptop in the office is beginning to look more like a reality.
B000002OFG|4.0|This album has some timeless classics, as well as some more simple-sounding tunes.  Which is understandable, since they were beginners at the time!
B002JI94J4|5.0|The Beatles are my favorite band and to see this movie in Blue-ray format is simply awesome!! I highly recommend this!!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great book! I wanted to finish it but at the same time never wanted it to end.<br />Hopefully the series will be just as great
B009O2XY12|5.0|It is completely addicting. I am on like the 30 something level and have never spent a dime. Best bubble game by far.<br /><br />*edit* I just beat the entire game and never spent a dime.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|I love the book it is really good people will love it because it is as really good book so you should get it
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|exactly what my husband wanted&#62; i was pleased that it was well worth watching, so seeing it over and over won't be too horrible
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading and implementing Mike's book.  It's nice to see someone who isn't out there just to sell supplements for their workout routine, like most \\"plans\\" on bodybuilding.com.  I have just started on Mike's workout plan and I love it.  I am a college student and I was didn't go to the gym at all last semester and now this is really helping me get back into it.  I will be sure to give updates about my progress.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun for when you are bored or just laying in bed :) I love horses and so this game is a perfect time passer.
0920668372|5.0|I always get this book for parent's to be. I used to have this one read to me and then when I started reading I loved reading it too!<br /><br />I LOVE this book and give it to a bunch of babies :)
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I couldn't have enjoyed it more!!  A wonder series and the HD and Dolby surround sound made it come to life.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Way less expensive than PBS and still supports them because it was bought through their movie house.  Go Amazon! It's a great deal.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game much better and interaction than the first absolutely love it!!! :) :) :) :) :) :)
B008602KQI|5.0|Some students really want these pieces even though they are hard to identify as themes.  My beginning/intermediate 6th grade girl love this book and has played 3 pieces so far.
B0039P1O4O|4.0|It does what it's supposed to. It's easy, simple, and has a good battery life.<br />Sound quality isn't great, but definitively exceeds the speaker on my phone.<br />There is a flashing blue led inside the unit. It's a little annoying while driving in the dark, but it wont bother you during the day.<br /><br />I do not regret buying this, and would recommend it to a friend.
0545265355|5.0|It's a great series and the boxed set helps me keep things organized and helps me keep track of them.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was good including the bubble quotes the funniest and just wrong part is when he screamed at the girl because she had red bumps on her face
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Gotta get them all.  Completing the set so we could watch them all was the goal and the price was right.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|It fit perfectly. I was completely satisfied. The screen cover is great too.It is light weight, and fits into most of my purses.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|love her voice.  don't listen to the radio, so she's not overplayed for me.  well worth the money you spend
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I give it 4 stars because it starts as Greg as a baby they could of did that in the next book
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Claire Boucher is truly talented and it shows in this album. Her voice is magical, the beats are uplifting and I don't want to stop listening.
B005C9YZKU|1.0|Why the limited collector edition does not come with a number inside the box as it is mentioned??? How come???
B009H442DG|5.0|This was a gift before Christmas for my 40's daughter, who absolutely love her Grease idol's singers. She was so obsessed with Olivia Newton-John, and watched the Grease film a zillion times, that I ended up nick naming her Liv, which I still use yet today, when we talk on the phone coast to coast.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is really good game&amp; it's not to scary but you get to explore in the games and it's really adventurous I just love it<br /><br />Genesis_santos
B001IAOEXU|5.0|Shipping was fast and arrived on time. The product fit perfectly onto the controller and made it so I wouldn't have to push hard on the L/R triggers.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|my family really enjoys this game.  Problem is:  we had over 80k points. and were at 24x when suddenly it erased everything and all of our trophies,  coins, items bought, characters,  etc were gone.  There is no way to fix this and my wife and I were competing on our kindles.  What a shame.  Who wants to start over.  I wish that there was a way to get help.  I am just glad that we didn't spend too much money on coins.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|This book basically reminded me of what I already felt I HAD to do to fulfill a life of art. It was a great reminder.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game. i was introduced to this game by my brother-in-law. It is a lot of fun and a bit of a mind game. It takes some thought to figure out the puzzles but it is fairly easy with different levels.
B004ZQBOXC|5.0|Besides the songs that got played on the radio over and over again the rest of the tracks on this CD are good. I easily know the words to all of them which are less of the party type songs. Surprisingly mostly love songs.
B000TEUSJK|2.0|Very contoversial in its debut. Wanted to see what all the hype was about. Not very impressed very violent with very graphic sex scenes. More like a porn flick with vilence thrown in.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|How could I not? I bought this as a lightning deal for like 5 bucks i think, it might be the best deal i have ever got.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Introduced my wife to the series and she could not stop watching! She spent the whole weekend watching the whole thing. She can't wait for season 2.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|this was a great book it was very funny and I think people who like funny book will love this book!!!!!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This game wanted me to purchase a full version of the game rather than be a free app as initally indicated. Trickery.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I really enjoyed the book but was slightly let down at the end with the daughters reaction to her birth mom..maybe it's because I have a Pollyanna mentality and like things to fall into emotional places that suit the situation..<br />I enjoyed the back and Forth of the chapters getting to know the two different families and cultures..<br /><br />It also reinforced that not all women have the mother or mothering gene but still our society thinks  that all women should or do have it..<br /><br />It's an easy read and one I would recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|It 's a fun way to pass the time -- and keeps your mind sharp in the process....<br />Just try it.
B006OAB432|5.0|It got here way before the estimated arrival time and it even included a cd which I had no clue came with it!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Interesting read. Looking forward to seeing how Lee Child develops Jack Reacher's character & how he interacts with future characters.
B00417HV14|5.0|I have found an awesome Artist that I love listening too.  I have been to one concert and I am scheduled to go to another in April.  Joe B, is Awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the game needs new updates and needs to make it easier to find diamonds and gold and needs ended pearls to teleport
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book was extremely well thought out and written.  Even though it was written about personal experiences it did not focus on just the author nor did it glorify any one Marine but told a riveting account of Marines in horrific combat.
B002AT4K9G|4.0|In case you are not aware, this iteration of \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" is number four in a well received line of theatrical offerings; a genre of movie that has helped fuel (no pun intended) the love of Illegal Import Racing.<br /><br />In this 4th installment, the cast of the original \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" make a much anticipated and needed return to the series. This time around, the group is stronger, more mature and well seasoned. For most viewers, the F&F franchise is watched for the cars and incredulous driving sequences, NEVER the acting. I am happy to say that the acting is very good, considering the scripts the actors were given. While no one will win an Oscar for their performances here, there was a decent storyline and a plot that tried to tug a little at the heartstrings. It was actually nice to see the chemistry between the reunited Paul Walker and Vin Diesel. Sadly, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez' speaking parts were far and few in between. Considering the amount of dialogue they were previously given in the original F&F, their lack of onscreen presence was a little disappointing... again, a little.<br /><br />This Fast and Furious is a prequel to \\"The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift\\". In that movie, we were introduced to Han, who, subtly in the last 2 minutes of the movie, was revealed to be a friend of Dom (Vin Diesel). That movie left open the possibility of there being yet another F&F movie. Well, in this prequel, the relationship between Dom and Han was fleshed out a little more, giving fans of Tokyo Drift some much needed back-story.<br /><br />The premise of this movie is simple. Drive like you stole it and PURE REVENGE. I don't want to fire off any spoilers here, so I'll make sure not to get too deep into the twist(s) in the storyline. I will say this though, in keeping abreast with the times and with those more \\"green\\" conscience, the 1st 20 minutes or so of the movie is devoted to the liberating of fuel from the hands of greedy commercialist businessmen and giving back to the people. The first exciting stunt sequence is found in this part of the movie, located in the Dominican Republic. One of the gripes I had about the first 20 minutes or so of the actual theatrical release is the fact that the audience was really never queued in to why the fuel was being taken. Thankfully, this has been clearly addressed in the mini featurette, Los Bandelleros. More on that later.<br /><br />This release of F&F is slightly more mature in feel. The actors are 8 years older and their onscreen counterparts have also matured. Paul Walker's character is now in the FBI's Los Angeles Narcotics Division, while Vin Diesel, who is still on the wrong side of the law, is more akin to a modern day Robin Hood. Michelle Rodriguez has grown a little, though we don't see much of her to determine how much she has matured and Jordana Brewster's character likewise has grown, living on her own in the house she and Dom once occupied. I think the writers did a good job at introducing a few new characters into Dom's \\"circle of friends\\". These individuals (including Don Omar) are a quirky bunch, that actually lighten the mood of the film in needed areas. Earlier I mentioned the short film \\"Los Bandelleros\\". Unlike many featurettes on DVD's, this short film is an actual Hollywood movie. Produced by Vin Diesel, this film goes deeper into the relationship between Dom and his core circle of friends, including the \\"soon to be deceased Han\\". In this featurette, we find out what the deal is with the fuel and can actually side with Dom and his crew for Fuel Transport Rig heists. While only 20 minutes in length, the featurette is a must see addition to the film and I would suggest watching that prior to loading up the full theatrical offering.<br /><br />Of course this movie has fast cars and some awesome racing scenes. However, these aren't the meat of the film. They are more of a seasoning, which works quite well for the film. Sincethis is a more mature offering, I think that wanton usage of cars and the exploitation of scantily clad females would be a gross disservice. The cars play the roll of getting the plot from point A to point B... and quickly.<br /><br />All in all, I pretty much enjoyed this film and would recommend it to automobile lovers and movie lovers alike. I give it a 4 out of 5.this is a more mature offering, I think that wanton usage of cars and the exploitation of scantily clad females would be a gross disservice.

B004JK61K0|4.0|I got an email with embedded jpg files that the regular kindle email app wouldn't show. After doing a little digging I found this app that shows the files perfectly and has a preview for multiple files. So far a very nice app.
B001GCUO16|4.0|Like many Generation X'rs, I'm a big fan of the XMen. I saw, and subsequently purchased, all three previous XMen titles and thoroughly enjoyed them. I think in those cases it was nice to see how the characters were discovered and how they grew in the XMen Universe.<br /><br />In the case of this first \\"Origins\\" picture, I think many of us really wanted to see how the \\"legend of the animal\\" (Wolverine) would play out on the big screen, well in this case, the flat screen plasma. I for one welcomed the chance to see how the characters would come together. In a word, the characters fell \\"FLAT\\". Aside from Sabretooth, the other characters were not fleshed out very well. Yes, Stan Lee and Company probably assumed that most people read the XMen comics and know the backstories and bi-lines of each character in the movie. I'm going from the standpoint here of someone who did not, though in all honesty, I do.<br /><br />In my opinion, too much was crammed into too little screen time, resulting in a poorly executed mess, with great visual and audio effects. Yes, we just HAD to see:<br /><br />1) the half-brother link between Wolverine and Sabretooth and how they fought in so many wars over like a hundred year timeframe<br />2) how Wolverine and the special strike team (team X) came into existence and what types of special ops assignments they carried out<br />3) Wolverines relationship with mutant girl-friend Silver Fox<br />4) how Gambit and Wolverine made acquaintance<br />5) how DeadPool was created and so much more.<br /><br />The thing is, it would have been nice to stretch the movie out perhaps an extra 20 or 30 minutes and really, really dig deeper into each situation while making the segue's less jarring and difficult to handle. The movie was a mere 109 minutes. An extra 20 or 30 minutes would not have made the movie unbearable. I mean, many movies in the theaters nowadays are about 2 - 2 1/2 hours long anyway.<br /><br />Like the previous 3 XMen movies, XMen Origin's action was top notch. The CG effects were done almost perfectly and believably. Well, let me rephrase that. The CG effects were believable MOST of the times. 2 times that come to mind that are laughably cheesy are 1) when Wolverine's adamantium claws in certain shots looked like poor, cartoony paper renditions of metal and 2) the diamondesque exterior of Emma Frost looked like a 4 year old child with loads of Elmer's Glue, \\"Bedazzle Beads\\" and silver glitter was unleashed onto the actress. If you have a decent surround sound setup, your sub(s) and surround speakers will truly be exhausted come the ending credits.<br /><br />Some of the mutant characters that make an appearance in this film (in no particular order) are:<br /><br />WOLVERINE<br />SABRETOOTH<br />DEADPOOL<br />SILVER FOX<br />THE BLOB/FRED DUKES<br />AGENT ZERO/MAVERICK<br />JOHN WRAITH/KESTREL<br />BOLT<br />EMMA FROST<br />CYCLOPS<br /><br />All in all, after considering the character development, storyline, special effects, backstory, video transfer and audio options, I give this DVD a 4 out of 5.action was top notch.

B008X9Z37A|1.0|I was under the impression that it was zippered, like the one I purchased for my wife.  I do not care for the way that the Kindle is held in the case.  The spine is already starting to bend away from the rest of it.  I would not recommend this to anyone else.<br />Sammy R. Johnson Sr
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|U fell in love with the first season and this second season did not disappoint. Kept you guessing till the end and you really get attached to the characters. Also if you are a huge Evan Peters fan like me his role is this one is amazing and he looks amazing.
B001O8D47S|4.0|I was stuck in a hotel in bad weather and this came on the television.  I thought it was fun.  I had no idea it is a remake of a movie from the 1930s.  I don't even have television at home, so watching in a hotel room in England was just passing the time.  This movie kept my interest.  I thought the cast was delightful and the underlying story of friendship was a good one.<br />I am always fascinated by movie/TV characters who seem to not have one iota of financial distress, but lots of personal unhappiness<br />It was not until the next day that I realized that there was not one man to be seen in the entire movie!! All of the crowd scenes were women only; even Mary's dog  was a female, and all of the children girls. Except that baby at the end... one can only guess!<br />This is not deep or a masterpiece, but a good comedy, though there is nothing funny about infidelity.<br />I liked it and recommend it
0316227706|5.0|This book is hilarious - if you need a good laugh it is well worth the price. My entire family enjoyed it!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another brilliant work by Sparks.  I am so glad I decided to read the book before setting the movie.  I truly couldn't put this book down.  I can't wait to see the theatrical interpretation of this book.  This is a must read.
B00263HWM8|5.0|From the gripping opening scene to the rock climbing heart stopper and everything that follows, this film held my interest. Containing action while still developing the human elements of Ethan Hunt, this film is a winner. One of the best MI's.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Loved the way Mr. Green wrote this book.  Felt like a teenager again.  Never felt like the characters were any less enjoyable though they were living lives of suffering.
1616550414|5.0|Zelda fans have been waiting for this since its Japanese release over a year ago...and the wait was well worth it!  Darkhorse did a fantastic job making this item truly special.  The hardcover is beautifully done, with gold embossed lettering and Gate of Time artwork on the front and classic Hyrule Seal and Master Sword down the spine.  The actual content was interpreted well to reflect the meaning of the text, not just a word by word translation.  The history is intriguing, and the art gallery, my personal favorite part, is fantastic.  It's really interesting to see how these beloved characters came to life.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I first read the book, and loved it. i am so proud that hollywood finally made a movie based off a book- ACCURATLY.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Love the new Halloween Frankin pigs and scare crow, zombie, jason pigs. The levels are challenging, and there is a new bird that uses bubbles to lift things.
B005IQZB14|5.0|As a Minnesota women who enjoys the outdoors, I expected to like this book but I was pleasantly surprised!  It was much better with more depth than I expected.  I am not usually an automatic fan of Oprah recommendations, but this one was great!<br /><br />The author did a fantastic job describing her adventures on the PCT trail along with sharing many intimate details of her life prior to her hike. It made me cry and it made me want to plan an adventure!<br /><br />I would highly recommend the book and and am anxious to read more from this author!

1613821670|4.0|Despite the romantic gothic style, this novel does pose several interweaving parables with strong moral overtones. The ethical themes of the book are its' greatest strengths, and this is why it has endured for close to two hundred years. The basic themes are ostracism, abandonment and especially desire. Wishing strongly for something may lead to dire consequences or said otherwise, be careful what you wish for - all may lead to moral decay. Considering that Mary Shelley wrote \\"Frankentein\\" at the young age of 19 (completed when she was 20), its' a remarkable achievement.<br /><br />The romanticism does not do much to give a sense of realism and themes become repetitive - we are told over and over of the torments of Victor Frankenstein. The narration by Frankenstein's creation is the high point of the story.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Nada mejor q escuchar la musica de una de las mejores peliculas d aventura q se han hecho, 100% recomendable para todos y mas aun para los fanaticos del Sr. de los anillos

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is so much better than the original temple run. I've seen copies of temple run (s) but this is the best by far.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've paid for games only to have my 9 year old son decide he didn't like it...money wasted.  This Angry Bird Free gave him a chance to play without my purchase.  I'm not a gamer but my son absolutely loves playing it.  That said, I would definitely purchase other Angry Bird games.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|this is a very straightforward, by the numbers, action movie, with a few notable performances. I think that the old Disney cartoon had more heart, but this versions dwarves were wonderful.
B00026WUAU|5.0|Once again, Bob Dylan grabs our attention with an imagination that only he can do.This album (CD,MP3,cassette,) however you listen to it goes great with your choice of drink; (at least 3 or 4).It always takes me back to the great times that were going on when it was first released.If you know & like Bob Dylan & have not heard this album; you owe it to yourself to own this masterpiece!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I absolutely love playing but the pop ups for other games us very annoying. I didn't get them when I first played but now coming up quite a bit only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I saw this band perform on a Morning Show and I just KNEW that it'd be something worth trying!  Their CD is a mix of some popular artists/songs that you will already know & also their own stuff...the unique thing about this band is they actually &#34;play&#34; the strings in the inside of the piano!! Amazing!  They do a little singing too, but it's mostly piano.  You will not be bored with this CD!  I have mine in my car and it makes for great, easy listening when I am running hectic errands!  Definitely recommend this CD!
B00596WEVI|5.0|The positive reviews here are right on the money.  Assassination Games is a terrific film by any standard and Scot Adkins and JCVD are top notch.  Adkins is a real star in the making. Deserves a theatrical run and well made sequel.  Fantastic.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is amazing. The only reason it's 4 instead of 5 is because when you jump or slide, it sometimes turns you instead. This has killed me countless times.
B0042816YK|4.0|The movie was a little slow however the actors made it enjoyable.  Little sad in parts however I wanted to see the countryside and sometimes we would all like to run away on our own and meditate I still rewatch it.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|The Complete Series for $24 what a deal! This is a must for any Dawson's Creek fan. All six seasons of the Joey loves Dawson, no Joey loves Pacey see-saw. This made an awesome Christmas present.

B004J4WNL2|4.0|This is a great study of introverts in an extrovert world. Cain does a favor to the one third to half the people walking around in the company of extroverts. A book like this was needed for  quite a while. Extroverts will say, \\"hum, so that is why they act the way they do. They aren't that strange\\" Introverts wil say, \\" \\"At last, someone has expained me.\\"<br />  I enjoyed it very much and am sure that the reader will also.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|VZ Galaxy S3<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good graphics<br />fun, and challenging<br />Free<br /><br />Cons:<br />even more micro transactions<br />a bit buggy ( swiping needs to be adjusted ) menu option isn't enough

B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Tom Hardy is badass in this turn as Forrest Bondurant.  Otherwise a fairly predictable prohibition story. Shia Lebeuf is ho hum.  Guy Pearce is punching the clock.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|is well worth it. Replaced 40mm fan in ZyXEL NSA310. Zero hum or clicks at the same rpm's. I'd say it is solid replacement fan for any NAS requiring 40mm fan.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Fast interesting read.  Part Anthony Bourdain autobiography, part, crash course in kitchen politics and pecking order.  Bourdain's journey from dishwasher to respected chef despite his self inflicted detours.  Start to finish in a few compressed hours.  You won't put it down.
B005R32L66|2.0|on version 2.9.501.31 Does not have option to utilize speakerphone mode vs phone speaker mode.  Booo.  Calls go through fine and video quality is also good, but not being able to hear due to this problem is subpar.
B009KHCT94|5.0|Nazis make great bad guys, you don't need a reason to root for their demise.This movie is really well done. It is a movie with high self esteem. It knows what it is and it's ok with it. Less campy than &#34;When Mars Attacks&#34; but still is in a class of it's own. You gotta watch this movie!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was so well written and the characters were so powerful. When I finished I had tears in my eyes and I didn't even realize I was crying. I don't want to write too much I'm afraid I'll spoil it. Just read this book, trust me.
B0032SQCQI|4.0|This movie was very good and well made. The main cast all act excellently. The story starts to fall apart about the last fourth of the film, but the rest of the movie is great and I would recommend it to anyone, espically those into sci-fi or fans of shows like The Twilght Zone or Outer Limits.
1435120027|5.0|A very beautiful hardcover reprint of Shelley's timeless tale. Please note though that this edition is illustrated with woodcuts by Lynd Ward. Not artwork by Bernie Wrightson as so many have mentioned.

030759565X|3.0|I absolutely love Perleman and her blog so I was super excited to get the cookbook. All of the recipes are amazing and the cover is gorgeous. The only reason I gave this book 3 stars is because the format is very weird. The recipes are not on the same page as the pictures in many cases and that really bugs me. Like...really bugs me. This review has nothing to do with Deb and all to do with book format! hugs.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|What a good movie to follow up to the 2nd Men in Black. I loved it and enjooyed watching this movie.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Threat Vector covers a very contemporary terrorist issue. However, for this fevered brain, I would have preferred that the acronyms be reduced in favor of spelling out their meaning.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is unique because it has mulitple mini games that can keep you occupied if you only have a few minutes, but it also has a fantastic overall story to keep you entertained for hours! The graphics and music are amazing as well. The only thing that stopped me from giving it a full 5 stars was that one if the sections wasn't working properly and I had to uninstall it and start my game over. Aside from that glitch it was well worth the money.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it very nice game. cant wait to get back to itnl. omelet of my favorite games to play on the kindle
3527406018|5.0|I got the book to see if I'd like to use it for a special topics class. Griffiths has a reputation for writing clear books, and this is no exception. The level is advanced undergraduate.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey. The reason pocket edition doesn't have everything that the PC version has is because pocket edition is going through the same stages as the PC version has gone through. Be happy that it has what it has. It's hard enough to program on a computer, let alone a mobile device. I have this on my iPod Touch.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I saw the film while studying abroad in Ireland and had to buy the soundtrack. Glen has such raw emotion in his voice, and you can't help but love it. Love this soundtrack.
B00000G3PA|5.0|What a cast they brought together to make this saga.  Very top notch adventure and tragedy.  I cry at the end no matter how often that I watch it.

B003B02O7I|1.0|This is a simple story.  It has his usual rapacious lawyers, the alcoholic hero, and a fight over a will.  The characters are one dimensional, the story line lacks any tension to make it interesting.  He adds a nice travelog, which could be found in any travel magazine.  This is not impressive writing, nor is it very<br />interesting.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I AM ADDICTED TO PINTEREST!!! Ever since I have &#34;checked&#34; out pinterest on a friends page I have loved it.  The ideas are wonderful! I would definitely recommend this app to others!!!!!!
B006QS0PF0|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody  Well written. Moving. I couldn't stop reading it. I will pass it to my friends.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book 6 times in the last 3 weeks. Soooo good!! Nothing more to say besides I want to hug both Travis and Pidgeon.
B008MEM24S|5.0|As a family that has loved the cartoon since it started this game is great. We all play it. My son has played it all the way through twice already. Thanks for an app we can all play.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is ...wow. I went into it thinking boy meets girl blah blah blah. I had no clue what to expect because I never read any reviews for it. But it seemed really popular so I bought it. This story is intense. Colleen captures the feeling perfectly and i felt myself really falling in love with her characters. highly recommend!!
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This is my favorite band right now. Love this album. And I love that I got it for a dollar with my amazon credits.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|That is how I feel about this game. Ziplines and roller coaster things. AMAZING!!! Now I just gotta fill up space so blah blah blah!!! Fey this game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|When I first started reading it I thought oh great a teenage book . I was surprised it is a teen book but so  worth reading. ITS SO SAD, but the people are strong and I hope it helps some teens to know there's help even if you don't think there is, there is always someone out there to help. Just be strong.
6302293553|5.0|I've never seen anything by Monty Python that I didn't like.  There's so many hilarious scenes that people quote verbateum!  If you haven't seen it you really need to!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Excellent book loved it I recommend it to anybody who needs a real life story and something that is real and could happen to anyone
0553801473|5.0|Took a very short amount of time to arrive, great condition, everything was perfect.  I love the series and book five is just as great as the other 4.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoy this app. I have a love for horses and this makes me feel like I have one. Beauty is the horse the app gave me and she is absolutely charming.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|this game really is fun, and it's not just buying land and expanding like a lot if these types of games are. you actually play minigames with all the pets that you collect, and it's a nice way to pass the time.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Due to publisher restrictions, some titles may not be wirelessly delivered to your device and instead require USB transfer from your computer to your device. These restricted titles also may not be accessed on Kindle reading applications<br /><br />This quote appeared on my library's website as I was trying again and again to download a restricted book. I know kindle may not have much to do with this problem, but couldn't you provide some understandable documentation about how to download via usb to a computer in order to get it to an android reader, as opposed to a Kindle, or an off market reader? And what does the last line even mean?<br />I never, ever get the drop down box to transfer to the usb and I can only assume it is the Android Device, but still, some documentation would help.
B004PVKFR8|3.0|I heard about AWOLNATION in one my classes. I have them a listen and found their music to be a little out there. It is very interesting, nonetheless. I really enjoyed their top song, &#34;Sail&#34;.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I love X-Men and this movie was epic! I loved it, plus the digital copy lets me take it and view it anywhere! It didnt take long to dowload it was actually really quick. The package arrived on time and in great condition. I definatley suggest anyone to by from this seller and this movie rocks!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Realistic idea of what it takes to care for a horse without the actual work. I own 5 horses and wish it was this easy.
B000002C2E|5.0|Love this album. I bought it again because my other one was wore out. This is a awesome album !!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game. Very good graphics and you can actually care for the horses. You can ride, groom, mix their feed and even pet them!
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|Perhaps someone can tell me if it is the disk or if it is my computer. I just received the entire Season 3 set yesterday.<br /><br />My computer won't recognize this disk.  If Windows Media tries to open it, I get a message \\" Disk is empty\\".  If the Blue Ray DVD software on the computer (CyberLinkPower - came with the Dell a year ago) tries to open it I get an error code and says it may not play newer movies without an update.  SO I update and it doesn't see the DVD.  If I use VLC media player, it says disk is empty.<br /><br />I don't want to watch on BluRay player simply because my husband isn't into this and that means it's in 'his domain'.<br /><br />I gave up and sent it back since I couldn't play this on my device(s).<br /><br />I'm sure of course, the CONTENT is amazing.  If I could only SEE it!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|in any form, any actor, Sir Doyle is in a class of his own<br />Sherlock, Marple and Poirot are wonderful for any movie goer or reader
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This is definitely a hilarious movie, but with college humor. So it might not be funny to all generations. The music choices/remixes were refreshing though! Instead of just redoing songs like shows like Glee, they remixed them, mashed them, and added dubstep. LOVE!
0800141660|4.0|His performance was very typical of him - maybe a bit to reserved<br />HOWEVER, Rickman was as clever as he is in all but one I've seen<br />He and Grant have played together in other movies which I found were awesome<br />The rest of the cast were A+ too and fitted the roles with much ferver
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie was just as funny now as it was when I first saw it. Tom Hanks has come a long way in his career.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I absolutely love this game except for one bug. Sometimes when you click the save me button on the kindle fire, the game crashes and the whole run doesn't count. I made it to 1.7 million without a save me, so when I died I clicked it... to my luck, the game chose to crash. It happens very often
0151003084|5.0|I bought this because my first grand child is coming and the usual ABC book just was not going to do.  Love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought this app would be bad. But it is great. It is way better than the first one. AWESOME!
B006UUK1YE|5.0|My son loved this at 8, just as I loved this at 8.  Need seven more words to make this go through...
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I know this movie is on tv all the time, but it's usually cut so dreadfully that you want to scream. This is a lovely interpretation of a long-loved story made for today's sophisticated viewer. Keira Knightly is wonderful, but she's in just about every scene, so if you don't like her, this isn't for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book in the Kindle version.  Very compelling story - even though I anticipated what would happen there were some surprises.  Notice they've made a movie of the story - bet the book is better.
B0019GO58C|5.0|DeNiro and Streep and young and marvelous in this satisfying love story that has its twists and turns. Although it starts and end at Christmas time, it's feels like a spring breeze.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|We saw him in Vegas and he played one of the songs in his show. We had such a great time we just had to buy this for the memory. We were very pleased to really enjoy all of the songs and would recommend this to any rod Stewart fan
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I like all they offer and information and like get updateson my phone.I appreciate all they offer.I enjoy all the games they help unwind.thanks so much
B007MDB548|4.0|Another good movie from Disney and try to continue the Fairy Stories.<br />Good Story Line, not as best as the first one. Like usual for most sequel.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Grandsons were elated to receive this as a Christmas gift.  Packaged very securely. Will do business with again with no worries.  A+
B009B8YZKS|5.0|always a fan of Halo as this movie is still good for me but too bad until today still did not manage to see Chef face
B00B2V66VS|4.0|get this app its awesome and amazing people who invented temple run your awesome get this app it will make u be hooked to it
B006YGC7KK|5.0|Fan of Maggie Q saw this blue ray is cheap and offered by Amazon thus would not want to skip the chance to purchase
B005GHN2GG|3.0|I have to say that while I liked this book, I feel conflicted about it as well, mostly due to the nature of the relationship between Silhara and Matrise. His behavior towards her is awful--he terrifies her to the point she regards him with fear. Not that he doesn't have good reason to be angry for the real reason for her presence, his behavior is just so absolutely horrible--I don't think calling it abusive is an understatement.<br /><br />Yet, as in many scenarios such as this, she ends up falling in love with him. Silhara has kept his real feelings hidden for so long it could be argued in his defense that he doesn't know what he's doing. But, all evidence points to the fact he does and is deliberately trying to drive her away. The unspoken tension between them regarding the lies and omissions they tell each other is interesting and sometimes painful to watch, in many cases because you know they are lying and omitting things that they don't necessarily want to.<br /><br />Matrise is an interesting character as she is, in some ways, smarter than Silhara. They are both incredibly stubborn. I simply believe I would have liked it better if Silhara hadn't been so harsh. She wasn't a wilting flower, though she did get stronger--she still almost never truly defied him. Despite his selfishness, he was willing to sacrifice himself for her, but should we really trust that his motivations are the truth? I think they are...<br /><br />Other than that, which is something that's a personal issue but still something I don't think sets a very good example--the writing is smooth and flows well. I liked the interchanges between characters, and I also liked Gurn. I found  Silhara's connection to his orange tree grove and the fact that it went beyond being merely financial gave greater insight as to the depth of his character. The details about Neith added greatly to the atmosphere. It was an entertaining read that kept my attention, with an intriguing plot that was a little differentthan the ordinary fantasy romance. It was just some of the elements of the relationship between Silhara and Matrise that were a little disturbing to me at times.<br /><br />All in all, I'm not disappointed I read it--I have seen other Silhara type characters, although I think he nears the top of the list in terms of general ill-naturedness. Of course, now that I've said that I can't think of any. I suppose any novel where the male MC has pushed the female MC away \\"for her own good,\\" without giving her a chance to decide for herself. For better or worse, Matrise is stubborn enough to want to make her own decision, and despite my cynical comment earlier, I do think Silhara cares for her--he can physically, he's just not as adept with the emotional aspect of it. I think he'll learn. But (I keep finding 'buts' here) he continued with the lessons in the beginning despite the fact he knew she was terrified and it made him feel awful to do it. I think I'm just going to go 'round and 'round with that. I know some might find the development of their relationship romantic--it wasn't that I doubted they loved each other, just that she could despite everything. There was, of course, the whole set-up of the nature of who they were in terms of their greater roles in the story going back to the historical figures. Maybe that subconsciously had something to do with the way they treated each other.<br /><br />But I do have to say I loved Gurn. I said I liked him earlier. He is an awesome character, really the best friend a person could want. Since much of the book centered around written language, it was nice that Gurn had sign language to communicate with, and that Matrise learned it. He's a very expressive character because of not speaking, and the little descriptions of his facial expression thrown in here and there were fun. And then for Cael the mage-hunting dog, with his constant stench. Everyone living at Neith is, in some way, flawed or broken, yet together they function together as a whole. Once corruption (literally and figuratively) is thrown into their midst, it shows the effects of what can happen on a small scale, and it's mentioned what's happening on a larger scale.<br /><br />The relationship between Silhara and Matrise also shows the need for the truth. The information they keep from each other, especially Silhara from Matrise in order to protect her, could have easily had the opposite result. One can only hope that he won't continue to go through life hurting people by lying and pushing them away. I think the end made it clear he isn't going to, but given his nature, who knows what the next temptation for power will be...
1451626657|5.0|Having previously red the book several times I knew precisely what I was getting.  I continue to loan my books to friends and relatives requiring that I purchase it again to re-read it.  Not entirely a BAD idea because with each new reading I get new entertainment value from the book.  VERY well written with a dry sense of humor concerning a very SERIOUS moment in history.  It is a very sensible spoof on army life during world war II with various things taken to their ultimate extreme to wring out the often buried humor.  I suspect this will not be the LAST time I read and enjoy the book.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|It seems to be well made, the only thing I wish was that there was a hole for the charge cord in the folded part. I have to leave the case open to charge it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great management tool for my new eBay store.  It has functioned flawlessly so far.  All the important functions have made handling my store ultra convenient.
0743277465|4.0|This is a pretty good story about how a guy learns to be a champion in anything he desires. I was hoping for maybe a little more actual how to.. After a while it seemed like more of a brag fest about everything he has accomplished more than actually teaching you how to develop your own technique. However his way of thinking is pretty solid. I enjoyed it!
B007PTJOV0|3.0|for some weird reason when i jumpthe move botton locks up. this has caused me to die 4 time already it is really annoying. that being said, the game reminds.me alot of super  mario i like the jump boost aswell as the acorn ammo. but the controls just arnt there for me
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I would reccommend this game to all ages.  if you get stuck, there is a hint button.  also of you want a little more challenge you can play the game timed. I really loved this game.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to it. I know this is meant to go with the 50 Shades Trilogy, but I think it's a great selection of romantic classical music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love the book and how it keeps you guessing keep up the good work Suzanne Collins!!! I loved it! :)
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I enjoyed the Pilot very much (which means FOX will pull it after 6 episodes...)  The show is well acted, by a great cast of main players.  Looking forward to the rest of the season.
B004NS710C|4.0|Just rented this movie from Amazon instant video and ejoyed it very much. Not a lot of unessary drama to make it more exciting the story facts were enough.
6305428042|5.0|they are so beleaveable as witches and are really funny in their caractures . when they suck the orra out of the children and get foiled at their capers its a great movie for the kids my great grand kids just love it ,as a matter of fact they wore my dvd out and i have to replace it soon so we can watch it again
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its really fun when i can get it to work on my kindle fire. it wont load for some reason. if anyone can help i would definatly love some!!!
B00004R9A4|5.0|when the makeshift witch makes the cloths & armer all move and kick the bad guys butts is really awsome
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season of Walking Dead so far. Fast moving plot with twists and turns, never letting up. Thank you for ending the stupid banter scenes in season 2!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so addictive. It's fun and challenging at the 9 x 9 levels. I highly reccomend this app.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This fantasy show is easily described as amazingly realistic, full of plot you could imagine from &#34;The Tudors&#34;, showing the complexity of feudal life and interwoven relationships, the difficulty of arranged marriages and what people were like in less civilized times.
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|This CD is pure Hatebreed! I love they haven't changed genres or messages! This album hits you in the face and keeps going with a positive theme and the energy they bring live!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|love it, watch it all the time. cant wait for February 10, 2013. Will watch as soon as its available
B000FCK65W|5.0|I loved the character, Francie. I loved learning about her life. I loved learning about the culture of her time.
034537410X|5.0|I've owned two of laberge books on lucid dreaming, I also have his audio work, he's a pioneer in the field, and everyone should start here. I loaned this book out 3 times, years ago, each time the person kept the book. I let them keep it because it's life-changing. I almost promise you'll have a lucid dream before you finish the book. I've been an active lucid dreamer all my life, and began really exploring about 17 years ago. Everyone knows me by the name lucid, and I even named my 12yr old son lucid. It can become a way of life. 1/3 of your life is spent dreaming, quit wasting it. Plus dream time feels to go on much longer. I've spent what felt like days inside lucid dreams, studying meditation and psychology, it's a wonderful part of my life. Just buy the book.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Nice app with plenty of features. Easy to use and share your pictures when you are done. Well worth it!
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game a lot but I would like it even more if they would update it faster because I have it on my iPod touch as well. I really want the portal and spell shop as well as the Dragon album but unfortunately this has not been updated so I cannot enjoy it as much on my kindle! :(
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loving this.  Was able to watch season one on NetFlix, was hard locating Season Two.  Great show, looking foward to moving onto Season Three.
B00992CF6W|5.0|gasometer app I love it but mojang needs to update so its basicly like the computer. other whys its great
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its really cool a little tricky at first but as you play it you get better and better. I really like this game.
1407108824|5.0|It was a good book - my grandson loved it!  Haven't heard back from the granddaughter =- assuming that she<br />enjoyed it also.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Let me say that I'm a nerd, geek, dweeb.....take your pick, but that means I know adventure point and click, hidden object games! I've spent hours playing all the ones I could find ever since I got my kindle a little over a year ago.....Long story short (too late) this is by far my favorite!! Relatively inexpensive , long enough to be worth the cost. Superb graphics, interesting and unique storyline, great options for difficulty and skip options. Spooky enough to be fun without trying to be more by adding silly stunts. I love love love this game and can't wait to not only see a sequel but also other new games from G5. Believe it when this nerd tells you to play this game....would I lie to you?
B005LAII8A|4.0|Not bad, hardly recognized Gordon-Levitt. Kinda trippy.<br />Pretty much what you would expect from the trailers.<br />Not bad for a Willis movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really love the game Virtual City Playground very very much I decided to rate this game app with five stars.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Not as easy to use as the Iphone IMO but still user friendly and easy to navigate.  Ebay continually updates apps makeing them better and better.  Plus its free!
B005FITIGO|2.0|The script could've been written for a high school play by a student (no disrespect meant to high schoolers). this is not just bad but wrong on so many levels. The whole thing is like a game, there's no real gravity to any of this. People telling each other 'F' u and 'F' me all the time does not make for realism, drama or emotion. That is empty and phony, a substitute for Drama. As in life, that often shows a lack of more intelligent communication skills. People trying to look shocked while looking at computer screens and then calling the next level manager \\"You've gotta see this\\".  Pathetic. NOTHING is explained. Interesting when Jeremy Irons asks for frank discussion and gets a few minutes of vague BS, the topic is then diverted and no one cares about anything except their own asses. The actors do the best they can but there's nothing to work with here. I could not stand Demi More's Character (the rightous, the innocent, and her bailout package 'better be good').  It's all so neat, no consequences and everyone escapes.  Maybe that's the point, but then a very serious subject to the American people is disgracefuly trivialized. I'm surprised because Hollywood usually is very 'self righteous' in demonzing the rich and greedy (as if they are not that).  Not that that's what this movie needed, but it did need some kind of point which you won't find here.  I can't say there was any real suspense, but the only thing that makes it not boring (and two star worthy) is that it is based on a real event that was not boring.
B005LAII80|5.0|I first viewed this on a mobile device, and really was not that impressed, but when I got home I watched again on a bigger screen TV.  It turns out this is one of those films you can watch more than once and keep picking up more interesting aspects.<br /><br />Overall the film has a troubling story, but the comic book fans are giving great reviews.  The quality of the photography is the best part, in my opinion.  As far as a story, this does have plot parallels with The Raid Redemption.  Wonder if the comic inspired that movie too....<br /><br />Definitely worth buying, but is extremely violent, graphically so.  Only thing missing is the smell of all that blood (if you ever worked in an ER trauma center, you know what I mean.)<br /><br />Now that I have seen the 3D version, I have to give it 5 stars.  A visually impressive piece of cinema, well worth owning, as long as you are not letting little kids see all the violence in it.  Kudos to the actors as well as those behind the scenes; this is a film accomplishment they can all be proud of!
B009A3NGF4|3.0|Religious allusions are a bit much for my taste.  The album is enjoyable, but it is less evolved.  It is very similar to the first album.
0061992860|4.0|This is the pocket version so it is small and easy to pack on hiking or camping trips. The Guide is full of good practical information one would need for surviving in the wild under a variety of climates and situations. This guide is filled with full color pictures and detailed diagrams to help illustrate the authors point.<br /><br />I would recommend this guide to beginner and moderate outdoor enthusiasts who are looking to expand their survival knowledge.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Super cool game.I mean cool.I play it every day.I mean every day.Yes it's that cool.I very much love this game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I really found it great easy and pulls up you mail fast and easy. But I like Yahoo myself had it for years
B007BFSYMS|3.0|this is ok for a free app but I think I am uninstalling now bc I found a better (free) one
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really have found this great, I use it all the time it is fast easy and friendly to use....... I wanted to add a few things that I have found this APP to be a Great Blessing easy to use along with so many helpful sources to help one in their reading of God's Word. Best Put Together APP With The Tools To Help One
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I think that this book is a great book and that the bummer is it should have a little more to the ending
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It is great even works for tablets and I found it easy and fast, so in my eyes I use it
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book, and the others in this series are just AMAZING! I love the mystery that comes with this book, and that you know nothing more than the characters, everything is a surprise. I just love this series and would recommend it anyone who loves a good book.
B002ZG997C|5.0|Judgement Day for our Hero when he has to dish out justice.  I recommend the movie because I did not expectant the Super Hero plot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run is like 3d to me it's better than the another one<br />Are u going to make another temple run
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great game i play all the time when I have time sometimes I put myself to sleep with the game
B0002F6BRE|4.0|The movie is awesome and the infinifilm is a really cool feature. My only disappointment was that there are no regular subtitles for the hearing impaired. My little brother is nearly deaf and we take subtitles for granted. Most dvds come standard with them. I guess we should have checked before ordering.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is a great follow up to Hunger games...the story gets even better!  I Can't wait for the movie now.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Someone told me to not give up and read all the way up to page 100, then everything would come together.<br />I am glad that I listened, because I got to 105 and I was hooked.<br />I finished it in 2 days, then rented the movie...<br />I am now on the next one....
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Excellent series!  Didn;t know what we were missing but had heard it was a great series.  Would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good show.
B004TMPJP6|4.0|I love Wunderlist and its ability to sync to phone or kindle.  What I DID NOT like was the meager instructions.  It is NOT as user friendly as described.  Once I got it going, it works well but PLEASE, more instructions, how to's and tips.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Excellent Series!  Family members had told us about how good this show was and we received this as a gift.  The show is so interesting and keeps us waiting for the new season to start.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|This game drives me crazy but I love it and the sound effects are awesome. These birds can do the best things
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I NEED TO READ THIS TRILOGY AGAIN! VERY GREAT READ...IT COULD HAVE BEEN MORE TO THE LAST BOOK...WILL READ AGAIN SOME DAY!
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The story was the usual little lost girl, then you meets girl, scenarios, but the singing really elevated it. I could have done without the vomiting scenes, however.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Interesting twists as this movie takes place in the sixties/seventies with the hippy movement; women's lib empowerment; with a side of the occult--witches, werewolves, ghosts, & vampires.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best World War II books I have ever read. There is much about the German side of the war and the atrocities the Nazis inflicted on the German people as well. This amazing true story of bravery and compassion cant be missed by anyone interested in World War II.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|This collection contains hits from both her solo career & her time with Fleetwood Mac.  She did contemporize a few songs with a heavy electro pop beat.  Also, she has versions of songs performed live.  Nice addition to my current CD/album collection on Stevie Nicks.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I didn't expect this book to go where it did but it did and as much as I hated reading it I just loved it too.  Really strong characters and their relationships.<br />I was glad with how it ended and just love it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Puzzles were on the easy side but there was just enough to figure out what to do next.  The graphics and story reminded me of BioShock.  There was just the right mix of HO and other puzzles and they all fit in the game.  I wished they wouldn't reuse scenes for HO but that didn't warrant less than 5 stars.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|These guys are here to stay around.  This is one of the best albums I have heard in a while - amazing production complete with a &#34;full&#34; harmonic sound.  Great group!  I look forward to hearing more from these guys!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game had a good story and a lot of cut scenes and detailed graphics and, because of this, took an amazing amount of my Amazon Kindle Fire memory to play.  I found myself putting most of my other apps in the Cloud to prevent freeze-up.  This being said, the hidden object parts were challenging but not impossible, I played it on the expert level with a two minute hint fill-up and was fine.  I will be looking fro more Alawar games in the future.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Very interesting way of spreading the Gospel, by sharing the Word of God. I am learning the many available opportunities on this wonderful APP. Bookmark, Share, Badges, Reading Programs, Everyday I learn something different. It is exciting, great, spreading the Good News of Jesus Christ. Try it, you will like it.
B004KZDV8E|3.0|Overall performance is OK.<br />However, it doesn't support 1600 memories and price is still high.<br />I would pay $5 more and get 3rd gen i3, although performance it self is not bad.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love  &#34;My Camera HD&#34; because I am able to table Pictures immediately, when I desire. I am also able to take VIDEOS for keepsake from the same camera with the &#34;one click&#34; option. Everthing is stored right where I can see them, show them, use them. No extra cords, space, time required, it's all there.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is one of the funnest and greatest games to be put into a classic series. One of the best out there !!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Love Stephen King, how can you go wrong.  It was sent immediately and is all I expected when a book was ordered.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Thsi is a great liitle app, this company should be very happy with their app, I AM!  You can download and save your youtube videos to your phone!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My opinion is 100% because I used to fall asleep in like...in hour at the least but with this thing on I pass our really quick and my favorite medieval mixed in with the thunder an river because it sounds like a really pretty storm outside while music is playing. My sister said it reminds her of titanic when the violin was playing and the ship was sinking in the rain it was the rain right? I'm not quite sure if I remember. BTW I'm 9 years old. Bye bye
B00006JSS8|5.0|This was a gift for out grandson.  He loved it.  I burned a cd for my personal use.  Great music and great memories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|U should totes buy this app!!! I has more than temple run the first!! U have zip lines, and a giant monkey..... which is so cool!!!  U should totes get this app, I really recommend this to people who don't have this app!!!!!!!!
B005LUJWMG|3.0|Follett's account of the rescue of the senior EDS personnel from Iran lacks warmth, it is rather one dimensional and uninspiring.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The case is neat.<br />It is nice looking and made well<br />It holds my Kindle securely.<br />I love the color purple
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I downloaded it. worked for a while and now wont load or turn on I'm pretty upset. fix it please.
B0046ECFRM|4.0|I don't know why, but there's just something about books set in boarding schools, especially ones in other countries. Unfulfilled dreams, maybe. Not that I'd want to go to one on Paris, myself, I think I'd rather it would have been in London, but I did enjoy reading this story.<br /><br />I've gone back and forth about the star rating on this one. At first, I had 5, but I'm going to ultimately go with just 4. There were times when I wanted to shake everyone a bit and just say \\"talk to each other you silly fools,\\" the teenage angst pushed my limits at times.<br /><br />That said, I like the author's voice, and of course I was book-crushing on St. Clair right along with Anna.<br /><br />This was a pretty quick read for me, a little bit of a sweetness break after having just read The Madman's Daughter (a book I also enjoyed, but it's was quite dark...)<br /><br />Fun, and highly recommended if you like a good contemporary YA romance.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you love history & time travel you must read this book.  It answers the question \\"what if\\" in such a beautiful way & makes you think about the choices you make everyday & the effects it has on the people around you.
B00005B4GU|5.0|When Radiohead were recording a followup to the critically acclaimed [[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]] at the end of the 1990s, they ended up with enough material to fill two albums. The more shocking fruit of these sessions -- ambient soundscapes marked by strong inspiration from the \\"Intelligent Dance Music\\" of Aphex Twin and other Warp Records artists -- was released on [[ASIN:B00004XONN Kid A]] in 2000. In the following year came AMNESIAC, 11 songs that are closer to the conventional rock music that Radiohead had already recorded, though distorted vocals, unusual instrumentation like the ondes Martenot and heavy use of tape loops give it some experimental spice.<br /><br />When AMNESIAC came out, I read some harsh reviews that called it mere leftovers or B-sides from KID A. Over a decade later, I think AMNESIAC is actually the better album. When I listen to KID A, I hear Radiohead as mere epigones of the IDM pioneers of the previous decade. Plus, the whole IDM sound is no longer as impressive as it used to, because such complex computer techniques are accessible to any musician. There are strong songs on KID A, but the ambient tracks are dated, second-rate and weaken the album considerably.<br /><br />By taking on IDM technology but eschewing ambient washes of sound and keeping a palpable rock beat, AMNESIAC has a timelessness about it and the 11 tracks seemlessly flow into one another. The writing is nicely claustrophobic and paranoid, fitting Thom Yorke's lyrics on the oppressive nature of modern capitalism and the surveillance state. It's a pity that this harsh and inciteful commentary has failed to persist in today's popular music, as pushes like the recent Occupy Wall Street movement (as risible as certain aspects of it may have been) show that these issues aren't going away.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Mommies and Daddies and other audience members who are expecting a traditional interpretation of the fairy tale of Snow White and The Seven Dwarfs, look out!  This movie is NOT for young children; although there is no real nudity and little profanity, there is a lot of violence, some of it pretty scary.  The story focuses on the antipathy between the heroine, princess Snow White, and her new stepmother/evil queen Ravenna, played by Charlize Theron (who, frankly, steals the show with her evil posturings and amazing wardrobe!).  It turns out that after the evil queen murdered her father, Snow White (played by Kristin Stewart, who does a significantly better job of acting than she did in some of her other films) had been imprisoned in her castle until adulthood, when she escapes and  flees into the Dark Forest (this part is scary for young children).  An enraged Queen Ravenna hires a wastrel huntsman to recapture the lost beauty so that she can steal her (literal!) heart and use it to become immortal and beautiful forever.  The main plot for the rest of the movie then deals with Snow White's efforts to defeat the evil queen, eventually aided by the huntsman and childhood sweetheart Prince William (Charming?) and a ragtag group of not-your-Disneyland dwarves!  The scenery and fx are excellent, the plot is well done, and the acting is adequate to good; however, the interpretation of this classic fairy tale is somewhat akin to that of the TV series Once Upon A Time, which perhaps does it better.  A likeable movie, however, and I am pleased to have it on my DVD shelves.<br /><br />I recommend the extended edition, since it is only four minutes longer than the original, costs the same, and I actually cannot detect where the additional minutes were added!
B00092ZL80|5.0|This will get you up and dancing for sure!  I never expected to like the combination of these two bands, but they are outstanding together.  I would absolutely see this concert live if I could!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|A great movie. I really likeed the show on the dediction on protcting our way of life and what it takes to survive. I love the seanes of the USS Missouri.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|all I can say is that I'm so happy that Backflip brought DRAGONVALE to aneroid!your #1 backflip!I definently recommend this app.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|When I saw this movie it made me think about what I could do with the knowledge of whats going to happen to me.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|there is not too many games that get my heart pumping fast.  i really enjoy this one.  the graphics are bright and real looking.  it moves so fast, i started to stand up to do it.  the monkey is so spooky, half the time i am just running from him.  its so sad to be captured.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I started reading this series because I'm a huge fan of the show. While reading it, I was delightfully surprised how similar it was to the show, especially with the characters - so kudos to whoever casted it! As you read on, you'll notice some major plot differences between the two and some minor differences that made the book even more interesting to read, just don't expect it to be word-for-word the same as the show. Don't butcher me die-hard-book-fans, but I enjoy the show a tad bit more even though I know it's based off of the books. I just feel the show is a more polished version. Overall, a great read and I bought the second one immediately after I finished it - so that has to count for something.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I spend many hours a day on eBay and this app makes it very easy to get where I need to go and can look up anything and it gets me info fast.
B004HXIZVC|1.0|Not what I thought it was. I don't use it.... at all now. Lots of BS to be heard. Some ought to shut up and listen to their own words. Changes day to day though...1 thumb down for the soundcloud.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|this was a gift to my sister-in-law who is a professional singer in vegas and she loved the &#34;new&#34; singer who sounded like her favorite entertainers  from the 50's
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it is awesome amazing grafics and just a cool game I would recommend it to all people who like horses
B0026P3G12|1.0|i love susan boyle's voice ...... she really belts out tunes but this cd skipped a lot so i couldn't enjoy it and eventually just had to toss it .....
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|It doesn't charge battery of kindle, rendering the kindle useless and making me a former user of the kindle and a user of printed books
030726999X|5.0|this is a page turner .... once you start reading this novel you simply CANNOT put it dow .... a must-read
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author is a  neuro-surgeon (brain doctor) who didn't really believe in life after death until he contracted a deadly brain disease, went into a coma for a week and lived to tell about it. He tells what he experienced while his brain was essentially dead.  His experiences are not just your typical near death experiences, but he describes some things that I've never heard of before. His description of heaven and what sounds like hell, are very different, and kind of Buddhist-like. This book is an interesting read.
B000NVIXDW|3.0|this was a gift to my sister-in-law who is a professional singer in vegas and she loved the 50's music
B007REV4YI|5.0|Some of you may not remember Albert Romolo (Cubby) Broccoli. Those of us who have followed him since the beginning of his career in film will be happy to know that his daughter, Barbara [...] continues his tradition of excellence with the release of SKYFALL. This is a fine work that moves the tradition of the James Bond franchise a step forward into the twenty-first century. It was the first James Bond film to be screened in IMAX. Those of my friends who saw it in that venue were overwhelmed with the cinematography--as much as I was on the small screen.  Buy this one--on BLU-RAY--Go for it! It will be the fastest 143 minutes of your life--a phenomenal achievement.    [...]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Amazing game it's definitely worth getting this is one . Of the best free games I've played<br />It's probably the best house game I've played
B000SEI618|1.0|Someone suggested this to my book club and like a fool I took her up on it.  When she didn't show up that particular night we were all ready to string her up for putting us through this total drudgery!  This book is dull, dull, dull.  The main character is nobody you can care about.  He plods through his life and you keep waiting for something to happen to him but nothing really ever does so that at the end you feel robbed of all that time.  The prose in the story that has been mentioned by others must have been hiding because I didn't find it.  I'd like those hours of my life back please.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I deleted it from my device since I wasn't insterested in using this game. Probably not my style or interest.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|Loved the movie and received the multipack for the kids at Christmas.  Was able to load the digital copy into onto my vudu account and watch anywhere.
B008K6HN8I|2.0|Haven't been able to get to use the camera, can't follow the instructions to even see if it's been installed on my Kindle
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I hope its good cause I have read alot of reviews on it so far so good thank u for great reveiws.
B0063IH60K|3.0|i guess i need to graduate to a more difficult game that is more challenging to me than this one is.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome game ... the puzzles are challenging and the story line is good.... recommend to play this on expert mode if you like a real challenge..
B002QS1O36|5.0|The singing, dancing and acting were subperb. Love scenes were hot with the Phantom, which I had not expected. Costuming was done to perfection. I just loved how the whole movie was done; down to the black and white sequence when auctioning off the opera house. Bravo! Bravo!
B004XS97KO|3.0|Better than Season 5, shows some greatness in some of the episodes. Impossible Astronaut & Day of the moon - great, loved River Song in both and I think Mark Sheppard as Canton Delaware III was the best new character since Captain Jack. Stuart Milligon as Richard Nixon was perfect. The Silence are really scary. -<br /><br />The Doctor's Wife is the best episode ever, the ideal of the TARDIS heart and soul being placed in a human being was great and the interaction between the Doctor and human female TARDIS is special. I love the part where the Doctor said's that the TARDIS didn't always take him where he wanted to go, but the human TARDIS said's that she always took him where he needed it to go.<br /><br />A Good MAN Goes To War is excellant, really loved the beginning with Rory on the Cyberman fleet. Loved where the Doctor yells at River \\"Where have you been\\"  The ending where the Doctor learns who River is perfect and knows he has snoged her (as the British say).<br /><br />Let's kill Hitler is a really good episode, I love how it shows where Mel's turns into River. I also love the shout out to Doctor # 10's companions. The interaction between River and the Doctor is amazing, how she goes from trying to kill him to saving his life and how she got her diary.<br /><br />Closing Time was ok, I liked the interaction between the Doctor and the baby was funning and silly and wonderful.<br /><br />But their were some really bad episodes in this season. The worst being -<br /><br />#1 The girl who waited, I mean really Amy - you had to wait 40 years, but Rory waited 2000 years in Pandorica opens and 60 years in the Doctor's Wife, Grow up Amy.<br />#2 Night Terrors<br />#3 & 4 The Rebel Flesh and The Almost People.<br />#5 The God Complex<br /><br />Overall a good season - worth watching.
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|Company releases updates frequently and the quality of this app has vastly improved over time. Not that it was bad before, but it just keeps getting better. I highly recommend this app.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a good book that is hard to put down!  Great characters and suspense expecially at the end.  I totally enjoyed it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is a lot better then the original temple run! The new graphics are amazing and I really like the being able to slide down the new rope! Being able to revive with diamonds is a nice touch! I recommend this to everyone!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I am just about halfway through this book, and I am having a hard time putting it away to go to sleep.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Our grandson LOVES Minecraft and LEGOs.  He wanted this item very badly but, because it is a limited edition (supposedly only 1000 made and was sold in England first), it was very hard to find in the USA! It was rather expensive, especially for as small as it is (it is a LEGO mini set) but well worth the price when we saw our grandson's face light up when he opened our package!  We are so glad that Amazon had this item for sale!  Thank you so much!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I got hooked (addicted) to the Angry Bird Series. My 5 year old grandson has got be hooked on it.  We play against each other.  I have to say he is much better than I am.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone that wants to read it because I think the book was very entertaining in many ways. For example, my favorite part of the book was when Greg got chicken pox.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I spent a year playing this game and buying almost everything. I come on today to find that the game completely restarted and I now have nothing. I'm deleted this stupid worthless game. such a waste of my time.
B00000JFV9|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to the CD.  It was of good quality.  I have no issues with the songs at all.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|This series is by far one of my top two favorite TV shows of all time. Hilarious and will have you laughing out loud.
B0064HJX56|2.0|I liked the first book...<br />This one was however a little boring the whole first half of the book, with her trying to find Ky.<br />I liked that it had Ky's perspective in this book, and i will probably read the next just because of Xander's secret...im hoping the love triangle gets more complicated.<br />i hope their is more twists in the next book
B00005JLEX|5.0|This DVD is a must have for any Seinfeld fan.  It came as advertised and on time.  I would point out that there are only 4 discs in the set.  At first I thought it was incorrect, but it turns out that Season One was only 5 episodes all together because it was a trial run for the show.  Once it was picked up they finished out the season, but went on to call the following episodes that year as season 2.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|was unsure about a case or which case to get and i am beyond please with this one.  would recommend to anyone that loves purple!!!!
B000FC12SM|5.0|This is a classic but a must have to refer back to from time to time as a reminder that those &#34;annoying&#34; quirks or habits don't have to be annoying once you understand it's hard wired into our personalities.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|After trying the less expensive charging cord and finding it totally inadequate, I purchased this one.  It works exactly as it should.  Sometimes paying less for something bestows no benefit.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is the only version of Pride and Pejudice that I will even watch.  It came on time in excellent condition and was worth every penny!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Updating my review....not happy with it.  Was fun at first as I said for two days and then it would not allow me to access it for a day or two and of course all my points went a way, this went on and on and yes to really play you have to get into your credit card.  So think over first what you want to do and how you want to handle it.  Disappointed.  Now, here is what I said before the control of the purse kicked in: Having had horses for my daughter years ago and having enjoyed riding as a young girl this brings back the memories.  And this is much more enjoyable at my age when my back can't take the real ride anymore.  I want my daughter who is turning 36 years young to join me in the fun!<br />Very creative and realistic.  I have such wonderful dreams of horseback riding and I hope this game will spur more dreams.<br />So my horse, Dreamtreader and I shall ride on into the night...
B009G8GRX6|5.0|When I first heard that this album had dubstep eelements in it I was sceptical but after listening to it I came to love it all around. It has really powerful sections as well as its softer moments. The new elements found in this alum's music work really well to capture the new sound muse was going for while still keeping some of their previous sounds.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This movie was so intense and I loved every second of it.  I thought it was just as good as the last one.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|There are several different kinds of music by one artist. I really am glad I purchased this one. I love the kind of cd that you can listen and enjoy each and every song till the end!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Why are some people so successful? Read the book and find out...it is amazing. practice, study, hard work and more.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's experiences with his 7 day coma were maybe a reason most don't come back! I had a near death experience years ago and what I recall, I am suppose to forget, that's what I remembered, to forget! But there was a sound that stayed with me and haunted me, and still does, because I feel close to remembering what I am suppose to forget when I can recall that sound. I believe Dr. Alexander experienced that same sound.
B0027MJU00|5.0|If you haven't read anything by Gillian Flynn this book is excellent. You should also check out Sharp Objects by the same author. Both books are excellent reads.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The series was very worthwhile for those of us playing catch-up with the Downtown Abbey series. The blue ray edition was well done.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Couldn't put it down. A must read for anyone that enjoy reading mysteries.
0760336954|5.0|How to Design Cars Like a Pro was purchased for my son who has high interest in designing cars.  It was a gift and my son loves it.  I highly recommend!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey.<br />I love this production more than I have enjoyed anything in a long while.<br />Please bring more on this story line.  It is excellent and you feel like you are there and know all the people.  This is quality viewing at its best.
0307272702|5.0|Updated on 3/9/13:<br />After reading several other low carb books, I think this one is by far the best.  It doesn't get into too much science and it's easy to follow and understand.<br /><br />Orginal review:<br />This book gives you a history lesson on weight gain all over the world.  You can pretty much skip to the Appendix for the diet plan if you don't care to hear the history lesson.<br /><br />What to do about it? -Basically, get rid of carbs in your diet.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. You will probably cry both happy and sad tears. A good read, it left an impact on me. So happy I bought this book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game but my parents tell me to stop playing but it is too much fun I play 24/7! This game is awesome. _
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is fun, but the time it takes for completing tasks is a bit of a downer. Since I just started playing, I'll give it some more time and see how long it takes to progress without actually having to purchase something .
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Awesome plot, great story!<br /><br />Recommended for anybody who likes family sagas. There is a lot of mystery to this book too so it makes it a very juicy read.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Good book, magical, held my interest, and kept my attention to finish the book. Recommend this, for reading to get into the magical world of the circus.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|If you want to read a fast paced novel that is heart-wrenching and beautiful at the same time you must read this!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book!! It was exciting to read as I continued to read the chapters. It is a must!
078513915X|5.0|Great way to help kids read classics and develope a love for reading.  We shall add it to our collection of Marvel Comics
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I purchased The Pilgrimage of Harold Fry  because my ancestors came from that part of England and my birth name was Fry. I enjoyed the book however  I was not compelled to stay up half the night to read it.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|I rate this product as okay<br />The problem I have is that my camera Olympus Camedia 5050Z will not go in this type of camera. When I insert the card into the camera it show an error on the card.<br />I think that there is nothing wrong with the card and for me it is useless. I wonder if I can return the cards which is no longer in the original package.
B002P79KAC|5.0|This is the best tv show ever!!! Everybody should watch it! I love the characters and it is absolutely hilarious!
0761171703|4.0|Nice looking book with many unusual photos.  I bought it as a birthday gift for a dancer friend of mine.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Enjoyed all the songs except for one! Very uplifting and inspiring!  Nice beats that are not to hard on the ears!
B009XHAM8G|5.0|I can still remember my own mother reading this to me as a child. I will do the same for my kids. It's a tradition and cycle I want to keep, much like the repetition in the story itself.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce rarely disappoints and she did not on this cd!  Most of the song brought tears to my eyes especially I was here!!
B005LHOKFS|3.0|I used this app during a recent trip to DC. It helped me locate an inexpensive breakfast place close the White House tour. I think the TripAdvisor web site or other travel web sites would have been more useful, but it is better than nothing when you are on the go.
B000H5U832|5.0|Love this movie. The people voiceing the characters were so aptly chosen that anyone else would have been wrong and the movie would have been just another childern's movie
0618871713|4.0|With beautifully illustrated, intelligent prose, Bechdel's narrative jumps around in time, but never lost me. I was struck by what an interesting and unusual character she was at a young age.<br /><br />Natasha Holme<br />Author of [[ASIN:B007NZRQAC Lesbian Crushes and Bulimia: A Diary on How I Acquired my Eating Disorder]]
B002VWNID6|5.0|Adventure, romance, fighting, 13th century England,  Kevin Costner, Morgan Freeman, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio  & guest appreance by Sean Connery what could be better!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my horse is awesome the only problems I have had are that when I first got it sometimes it would not load and now it will load but there is a ton of adds
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My knidle didn't come with this cable and I really need this cable to make my kindle charge correctly. Thanks
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is sweet sore the PC minecraft is better but its totaly worth $6.99. but if you don't believe me that's what you think.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|What's not to love about this story and Travis? A lot of things happen in this book and i loved everything about it... Give me some Travis ;)
B00B2V66VS|4.0|when I try opening it on my kindle fire it goes back to my homescreen please fix this from that its a great game to play I recommend it
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Twisting plot with many surprises but a very amateurish ending.  The ending seemed as if the author was in a hurry to finish.  So disappointing.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|best book i have read in a while i balled my eyes out at the end but i loved it
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. I use this on my kindle fire and it works perfectly. I recommend this version to anyone.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I would recommend this book. It is my favorite of the series. I love the ease of use of a kindle. It's is easy to download and read on the kindle. Great products and services.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|This documentary concerning fracking and natural gas lobbies and practices is a must see!  Eye opening and very well done!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Nice to obtain all three books in one purchase. Made it easier to go from one to the other without losing the big picture.
0141185163|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I love being able for the first time to read commentary about it. A definite must read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great Great great. I started off watching because of nagging co-workers i told them im tired of zombies vampires and Wolves. I started to watch on a promise to try it and 3 season later im hooked. season 3 is awesome the sword lady is my favorite cant wait to see the second half
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I think that this is a nice game. works functions and is  rather fun. I have played some other games that are a lot alike but this is just as good. if not better
6305807086|5.0|This film is quite strange, presumably if you have read the cover you know the basic premise, so I will not bore you with the details. This cast performs flawlessly especially Malkovich, and the direction adds to the mood and strangeness that this film depicts. Being John Malkovich asks the question what it is that drives man. This question is handled both on literal levels and figurative levels, which results in the comedy of the film. What frightens me is the lengths people are willing to go to to find happiness. Everyone is willing to simply overtake Malkovich to make a little extra money, be with another person, or live another 44 years. All of the characters are extraordinarily self centered, and ultimately that is what makes the story thought provoking.<br /><br />Of course there are moments when the film is far fetched, its premise is nutty and characters are a little too willing to believe in the impossible things happening around them. Not a single person questions Craig Schwartz (Cusack) after he first enters the mind of John Malkovich and goes telling everyone about it, the people he confides in simply take it at face value. But this film ultimately succeeds because it is a human story, a story that focuses on our greedy motivations.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great game so addictive once you start you cant stop but while you play you enjoy ever single second. I think you should totally buy this game oh i remember its free!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As I am not a cable or satellite TV subscriber, I get only OTA broadcasts and was unable to watch this show when it was broadcast on Discovery. I watched this for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and the footage is gorgeous. This show remains mostly unbiased although it contains some pro conservation messages, it is nearly impossible not to in a nature documentary. This is a show that is educational and extraordinarily pretty. If you are interested in learning about some more interesting ecological parts of the planet this series is for you, If you just want to look at beautifully filmed images, it fills that as well, but most people, I expect, are like me and will be drawn to the whole experience this show creates. The video quality on the blu ray could be better, these are single layer disks containing 25 GB, so it isn't as good as it could be. That being said the whole thing is so immersive I scarcely noticed that the images were imperfect, then again I am not a videophile.
0812550706|5.0|Being a first-time reader of Ender's Game at the age of 26 (perhaps late to the party), I soon came to find that this book is not by any means easy to put down. In fact, I read most of it between customers at work on my iPhone. I recall reading sci-fi quite a bit when I was in junior high and high school, but most of the novels I read were just expansions on already popular film works such as Star Trek, Star Wars, Aliens, etc. None of those were particularly memorable in having a great degree of depth, but the stories were still enjoyable. That being said however, Ender's Game is far more than just a science fiction novel. Unlike other books in the sci-fi genre, I felt compelled to pay close attention to every detail. I'm actually glad I picked it up now that I'm older and able to comprehend the complexity of emotion and ideas present in such a book--a feat which I'm sure would come at a much younger age for Ender himself.<br /><br />From the very first page, it's obvious that Colonel Graff is the \\"bad guy\\", until you later come to realize that in this book, such terms make about as much sense as floating in nullo gravity. In fact, Card's entire description of the like combined with his emphasis on the reorientation and breaking down of a young, impressionable mind through such tactics as surrounding Ender with enemies, constantly moving and pushing him, forcing him into positions that demand the most of abilities he is still too naive to realize are within him--much as he may deny them--all of it creates a constant tension. What you eventually discover about the story itself is that this tension provides just enough gravity by which to anchor the reader down before hurling you into the Battle Room, where you must then abolish your preconceived notions of what it means to be good or evil and right or wrong. In Ender's Game, these ideas are frequently challenged, frequently protested, but always justified.<br /><br />Everything depends on Ender's abilities as much as his willingness to continue. Whether the imminent destruction of Earth will occur or not is irrelevant to him. What matters most is his personal desire for love, happiness, and comfort, yet even these are often stripped away as inconsequential--be they from higher authority or at rare points, even by Ender himself--when it comes to his deep underlying NEED, above all, to UNDERSTAND--and therefore LOVE, in its highest form--that which he hates most. Sometimes, it is himself he hates the most. Sometimes it is Graff, other times it's the enemy of the chapter or scene. Stilson, Bonzo, Rose the Nose, etc. From any perspective you view it however, he is constantly learning and understanding more about himself as much as he understands the system. That's his journey. He knows that he entered the Battle School willingly, perhaps in order to understand himself, though he may grow to hate it. In this way, it should have been clear to him from the start that it is meant to crush him. Because he strives to understand things, because at heart he is pure. He wants to learn, to understand, and to love.<br /><br />But he will also crush that which he loves if he allows himself to be pushed by the wrong people. Ender is easily manipulated because of his willingness and desire to understand, and in this way, he perhaps retains a bit of his childhood innocence. He is not completely naive however, and his most brutal actions are either committed out of frustration in not being able to understand or not being able to communicate on the same level--this is consequentially the same plight the Formics faced in their first dealings with the human race, and so it comes as no surprise that Ender is able to relate to them.<br /><br />Above all, it hits on some age-old questions. Why can't we communicate with each other? Why can we not understand? And is it sometimes futile to attempt to understand? For when you believe you have the answer to everything, it's not always so obvious as you thought. Can evil actions be justified in the name of self-preservation and war? What happens to soldiers when the war and its intensity are over, how can they re-adjust from such a grueling life, and how can they live with the lives they have taken?<br /><br />There are many questions this book both asks and answers, and of course such answers will all depend on how you are able to reorient yourself in a zero-gravity environment. This book has made me look at life and human interaction in a very different way, and despite that I may not agree with the author's personal views, I can sure appreciate his talent in crafting such a great story...especially one that renews and strengthens my own desire to both understand and love that which I've hated most.<br /><br />I was absolutely obsessed with this story, and I'll definitely be purchasing the rest in the series.ht.

B000F4PD7Q|5.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is hard to place in a genre, and I think that is a good thing. The film is comedic, dramatic, and has plenty of action, as such it is sure to satisfy most viewers. This film features stellar performances by Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer who bring a good sense of humor to the screen. The story is well told, although some may find it a little convoluted. This film is good  fun and I would recommend to fans of most genres.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case is great for my Kindle and how I use it.  It is lightweight, which is good since the fire itself is a little heavier than I expected.  It protects the kindle nicely but it doesn't make it too bulky.  I can easily fit the whole thing in my purse and take it with me.  I also really like the fact that the cove acts as a stand.  You have to break it in a little to get it to work properly, but it doesn't take long and then it works like a charm.  Highly recommend it, in any color.
B007PVHANM|5.0|Nice pictures, great audio. The content was interesting and very nice. Must seen for all Marley and Reggae listener. Enjoy
B004OXCL5Q|5.0|I loved this movie when it came out years ago.  Wanted to see it again. i'm sure you would enjoy this movie
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|After reading the graphic novel years ago, like many of you I was both excited and nervous to see how well it would translate over into a film.  Although I miss Bruce's internal monologues, this movie does fine to capture his ideas and methodology without a voice over.<br /><br />Even though the comic's look and character design felt dated, it does add an extra depth and unique look throughout both films which further solidifies it as self contained within its' own universe.<br /><br />After part 1 was concluded I remember thinking that part 2 felt like it wasn't coming out for a very long time... and now that part 2 has come and gone I wonder what we bat fans have to look forward to in terms of his next appearance?<br /><br />Lets all hope the Man Of Steel film doesn't tank so that WB gives the Justice League movie the green light!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|this game is really fun because u can really interact with the horse and feed it and clean up after it and compete with it.

B00B5D32XS|5.0|The second season was so very different from the first!  Even though many of the actors were the same the stories are uniquely different.  I feel it is unfair to say one season was better than the other. They were both excellent in their own way.  Throughout this season, as I watched from week to week, the characters I found detestable, proved to find their way. Their struggles to find a glimmer of humanity within were heartbreaking. The final scene with Jessica Lange and Kit and the children was phenomenal, a powerful portrait of redemption and love. Such a sweet ending for a lost soul struggling to be found! The movie industry sings the praises of Meryl Streep loud and clear, however in so doing is often remiss in recognizing the important talent of actors like Jessica Lang and many of the actors in this cast.
B004RL9T50|2.0|Ummmm disappointing. The script does not grab you. Although unique it's a sleeper. Will and Tina are the only thing that got us half way through. It's not good :(
B0031RS44S|4.0|like all the Reacher novels, this one is darn good .... although I am starting to get a better idea of what may happen in the future - what does it mean when you know what is going to happen before Reacher does? :)

B007BFSYMS|5.0|FOR USERS OF KINDLE FIRE HD - COMPETING APP FLAW (SLEEPY TIME)<br /><br />There may be several of you out there who purchased for their Kindle Fire HD an App similar to this one called \\"Sleepy Time.\\" I was one of those people; it worked fine until I upgraded from a Kindle Fire First Gen to a Kindle Fire HD.  To my dismay, the \\"Air Conditioner\\" sound on \\"Sleepy Time\\" developed a continuous loop where there was a constant gap in sound every few seconds.  Needless to say, this repetitive gap in sound was extremely annoying. (Incidentally, the gap problem affects the other sounds as well.)<br /><br />MY SEARCH FOR BEST AMBIENT NOISE APP<br /><br />In light the above, I began searching for another App that could accommodate my need for ambient noise when falling asleep. \\"White Noise\\" is the perfect App for this. There isn't a gap flaw like there is in \\"Sleepy Time.\\"  I will say that while \\"White Noise\\" has over 50 sounds from which to choose, Sleepy time has over 80. But what use is 80+ sounds when they are flawed?<br /><br />COMPETING APP (SLEEPY TIME) FAILURE TO RESPOND<br /><br />Of interest is that a little over a month ago I contacted the developers of \\"Sleep Time\\" about the gap issue via the e-mail link on their website. -The website actually had a post from the developer saying that the gap problem had been fixed-  Obviously this is not true.  I never received a response to my e-mail. I tried deleting \\"Sleepy Time\\" and reloading it to make sure I had the current version, but the problem was still there.<br /><br />FINAL COMMENTS<br /><br />There is a free version of this App called \\"White Noise Lite,\\" but the number of available sounds is much fewer than 50.<br /><br />If you are looking for a reliable/defect-free ambient noise App with plenty of sound choices (particularly if you own a Kindle Fire HD), then this App is for you.  (Of possible interest to you is that Dr. Oz highly recommends this App.)
B001CTGQBK|5.0|just rented it because we hadn't seen it in a while.  the music is terrific, and the story is a timeless classic.  always worth another viewing.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This was a very good story.  Farfetched, but not meant to be anything else.  Reminded me of some of Rudyard Kipling's stories.  I would recommend it to anyone that wants to simply escape into a story without regard to the believability of it.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I am writing this review because the game prompted me to. As a reward for my efforts, I get 3 gems. I have only played this game for about 10 minutes so it's too early to give a reliable review. I might update this review later but don't hold your breath.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to start reading book 3, once you start reading you can't stop. I am sure book 3 will be just as good

B0063IH60K|4.0|A great game, its the only solitare game I have.  The game gives you alot of options while your playing and you cann't beat the price which is free. Keeps your mind alert and active.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|This was great. I had seen season 3<br />before the begining and thought it was<br />ok but then I bought the first season and<br />it all made more sense. If you like zombies<br />this is a excellent series. The best part about<br />The Walking Dead is that it goes far beyond zombies and<br />pulls real people with real issues into the mix.<br />Most other zombie movies or series are just<br />another zombie killing excuse.

B0099Y2MYK|4.0|HI<br /><br />I got the DVD last night and must say I was upset.<br /><br />I watched EPisode 5, having seen it on PBS Sunday night and there was a scene missing.  Running time was 49 minutes as opposed to PBS' 51 minutes.<br /><br />The scene missing was where Mrs Hughes in the kitchen mentions that there's a woman in the village who had a baby and can feed Sybil's baby.<br /><br />On the DVD  the only mention of the village woman is when Cora tells everyone in the drawing room upstairs.  I have noticed all PBS so far have run 51 minutes.  And the 2 version I watched on the DVD (UK version as sold by PBS)  runs 49.  I cant believe this. Why would they cut out 2- 2/12 minutes per eippisode on the DVD?<br /><br />Just wanted everyone to know.  But the quality is wonderful and none of that awful jumping which was evident in Season 2 dvd set which many people had a problem with including mine.

B009AMANBA|5.0|Lincoln isn't a perfect movie (what is?) but it is extremely impressive.  It only suffers in comparison to what a \\"perfect\\" movie about Lincoln would be.  In comparison to mere mortal movies, it gets 5 stars.  I can't believe that it would get any competition for a Best Picture Oscar from silly films like Django Unchained.  Argo was good, but not nearly as good as this one.  Lincoln will enthrall those who are interested in this dramatic, amazing time in US history.  Yet it's not a war movie, it's a look at Lincoln the Man and how he navigates his role as US President, masterfully.<br /><br />Daniel Day Lewis is wonderful as Lincoln.  For an Englishman to play Lincoln so masterfully, he deserves the Oscar for Best Actor.  The look and feel of the movie is amazing.  You believe that you're in a time machine and that you're really THERE, in Washington, in 1865.  The portrayal of Lincoln's political infighting with an entrenched and arrogant Congress to get the 13th Amendment passed, is intriguing and intelligent.  Day inspires as Lincoln throughout.  One really gets the feeling of a storm of swirling voices in a desperate time of war, crying to be heard and followed, while Lincoln is the Man of his time, calmly staying strong and resolute in the midst of this chaos and grinding out his policies.  If Lincoln hadn't show great Leadership and pushed the 13th Amendment at the time he did, who knows when the country would have gotten up the courage to abolish slavery again?<br /><br />The secondary performances are great, including Sally Fields as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as the Abolitionist Congressman Stevens, James Spader as a shifty Republican operative, David Strathairn as Secretary of State Seward, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln.  Fields in particular played a very difficult role (of the suffering and neurotic Mary Todd) very well.  ALL the performances were so well played -- like I said -- you think that you're really there in 1865.<br /><br />Lincoln, the movie, doesn't pull punches.  I hope that the producers made sure that they researched their material well and stayed true to the facts, because it makes SUCH an impact.  Film-goers who always thought that the Democrats were for freeing the slaves will be surprised to find this truth out: Demos in those days were absolutely for slavery and it fell to the Republicans (split into two camps: the Abolitionists and the Conservatives) to push the 13th Amendment through.  The sentiments of the anti-13th-Amendment crowd in those days is also portrayed with shocking candor.  Racial fear and hatred is expressed openly in the movie.  It's hard to swallow at times: was this really the mood of the people, or was this played up by Spielberg artificially?  Let the viewer watch it and decide!  I'm personally going to read more first-person accounts of that time of history.<br /><br />I have a few \\"small\\" criticisms of the movie:  some of the scenes where citizens seem to me to be insolent in front of the President were hard to take.  (An opening scene with some soldiers talking to Lincoln in a very familiar and non-respectful way; a scene where Lincoln bursts in upon a lobbyist who exclaims, \\"Well I'll be F****ed!\\")  I would think that coming before the President would cause 99.9% to be utterly respectfull if not petrified!  Also, the opening scene of black Union soldiers hand-fighting & killing Confederates up close & personnal, is disturbing for those not thick-skinned.  I'm really not sure that that scene needed to be in there as it was.  But if the viewer can suffer these small annoyances and look at the overall magnificence of this film, I believe that he/she will be impressed with Lincoln's intelligence, power, realism and emotional impact.

0374275637|5.0|Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman is likely the most amazing (and surprising) book that I've ever read. I highly recommend it, especially for HR professionals, managers and deal makers. According to the author, many prejudices (biases), positive and negative, may cloud our judgments on a daily basis and in unexpected ways. At times, those events are harmless. Other times, we may lose a promising business deal or not hire a great professional because we cared about the wrong details (and we may do so unconsciously). The so-called \\"representativeness\\" is a dangerous bias that we all need to understand and manage.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Listened to the audiobook (so masterfully read by Bernadette Dune) in a 2 day drive across the country. As a woman with similar experiences, I found it honest and well written. The negative reviews that this book has recieved are very critical of the author and her actions but I have to admit that her actions were not unlike so many of us who have searched for comfort, love and self-esteem in many maladaptive ways but persisted, struggled, searched, wandered and finally successed. Thank you Cheryl Strayed. It comforted me to hear that I have not been the only one to have made big mistakes in life. It was an honor to hear your story.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.. The characters were real and you are left on the edge waiting to see what happens next..
0812550706|5.0|What can I say that has not been said before?  Without a doubt this is one of the best books ever written.  It should be in everyone's library.  Well written and with a completely compelling story line, this book captivates from the first page to the last.  If you have not read 'Enders Game' do yourself a favor and do so as quickly as you can, you will not be disappointed I assure you.

B0076DCT2G|2.0|Maybe DeMille planned for this to be a very weak story but I found it disappointing&#62; I have read most of DeMille's books and most I found to be entertaining but this one really stretched the imagination. I did not like the totally negative put down of Yemen and the intentional misleading. The intended/attempted assassination of other US Government employees with the implied sanction of the US Intelligence agency's was unacceptablel. There were a lot of other negatives in the book and frankly after I invested so much time (too much) in the book I stuck it out to the end but it was a chore. Not an interesting or entertaining book with a weak ending.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Paper Galaxy was entertaining and fun to play. I thought the graphics were great too. The only downfall was that I beat it fairly quickly, but for .99 cents it was worth the purchase.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am very picky about the apps in the app store but this is my favorite game I have ever played.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|Great Product, Love it. Very accurate and easy to read and undrstand. Study notes understandable and very informative. Thanks for the software it's great
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|There are parts of this game that don't allow you to click on them in the paid version. I have enjoyed the game until this point. specifically when you connect the rope to the car block and the coffin.
B00076OMW4|3.0|No question about Fritz Reiner having absolute control over the Chicago Symphony Orchestra here. The playing and precision of the CSO is first rate. As for the sound I bought this SACD version hoping for a sound as fresh as some of the other Reiner RCA Living Stereo SACD reissues, but these recordings lack sparkle and 3D ambience even compared to some of my ordinary CD recordings of the same material.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I was just hoping for a good read and an interesting story. Wow I really love the stories that are told in it! It was so informative, and it gives you such a bigger picture of WWII. It really shows the struggles of the people on both sides, as well as the honor that can be found among both sides. Very inspiring!
B000E1NWJQ|5.0|I own the earlier Living Stereo remastered CD of these works. The two channel SACD transfer on this disc easily outshines the already very good 1995 CD transfer of these recordings.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I was happy to find this book on Kindle as I&#34;m trying to update my library to be more electronic. This is a book that I refer to on occassion as I'm looking at other counseling resources.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|But really good fluff, escapist reading. Good for a long, hot bath with a locked door (if you have kids, lol).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and this app makes me so happy and I think that is you should get it if you love horses
B009P5S11G|3.0|I like Rihanna a lot, I think shes really innovative when it comes to music. Though I was pretty dissapointed with the entire album, let me give you my opinions on each song:<br /><br />Fresh Off the Runway: It gives Rihanna a new type of sound, and I mean it sounds okay. Theres nothing special about the track, but I think its catchy.<br /><br />Diamond's: Was released as the 1st single, and I mean the song is amazing. Which is why I was shocked the entire album didnt sound this good.<br /><br />Numb: I sometime's listen to this song, but I mean there really isnt anything cool about this track. Its lame, generic, and its just another filler track for the album to me.<br /><br />Pour It Up: Was released as her 3rd single, though the song is just lame. Nothing special about it, its something we all have heard, just another filler track.<br /><br />Loveeeeeee song: I actually like this song a lot, its one of my favorites. Its not the best song I have ever heard, but I like it, I think its a great song.<br /><br />Right Now: This song should have been released as the 3rd single. I mean I dont think the song is amazing, but its an OK pop song, and way better than Pour It Up.<br /><br />What Now: Eh, the song is okay. The song does sound at least a little different from the other songs on the album.<br /><br />Stay: This song was released as the 2nd single, and I like that its a ballad, but honestly the song is just so basic. The meaning of the song is good, but the lyrics just ruin it. Saying something as simple as \\"I was you to stay\\", be more creative and say \\"Never leave my side, be forever mine, and let me be complete\\", or something like that.<br /><br />Nobody's Business: Eh, the song is okay to listen to, but really its just another filler track. I dont hate the song, I just wouldnt mind if I never heard it again.<br /><br />Love Without Tradegy: Probably another one of the only songs I like on the album. I do like that its a ballad, and the beat to it its pretty cool, but the lyrics make the song kinda confusing. Its a good song though.<br /><br />Get It Over With: I think this is a good song, its slow, but catchy.<br /><br />No Love Allowed: Kinda reminds me of Man Down, with how the beat sounds. I like the song but I mean its just boring sorta. Just another filler track.<br /><br />Lost In Paradise: I think that this song is good for the most part, a little boring, but its tolerable.<br /><br />Half of Me: One of my favorites on the album, the song is more biographical, but I mean the beat and everything is well put together.<br /><br />Im probably going to seem like a big time Rihanna hater after this album lol. I like Rihanna but this album is just kinda basic. She needs another album like Good Girl gone Bad, or Loud. This is her 7th album, and shes been making a new album every year, but honestly she needs to just take it slower. If she produces an album every year its only gonna have like 2-4 good songs on it, and the rest are just gonna be pretty crappy tracks. :/, I hope her next album will be better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i absolutely love this game. i love how you can have your horse and you dont have the leave your home to care for it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome ap!  But it took FOREVER to download and install. So pretty much it is a great app. I love t-run 2!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a well-written inspirational story of one person's journey to a spiritual awakening. The overwhelming message this person has come to believe and relates to the readers is that God loves each one of us unconditionally. This is the same good news that the Catholic church teaches.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|It's not an Oscar contender, but who cares? I like a taut thiller with an actor who could take direction from a monkey and make it work. Nothing to dissapoint here for a nice movie night.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Some parts of the book were a little too technical for me. Otherwise, it was an interesting and enlightening non-fiction book.
B009AMALLM|2.0|This movie was bad for soo many reasons. Reason 1. The makers tipped their hand becuase everytime somone is going to die, the camera focuses directly on the person in the frame, blocking out the background. When the background is obscured you can't see what is happening behind the person on film, when suddenly they turn around the killer is there waiting to make a quick end of them. And it seems weird that while some characters are running in fear they never drop the camera. If I were being chased by an evil entity the camera is the last thing I'm running with.
0446530573|5.0|I purchased this cookbook because a friend made the Sunday Gravy, which is awesome and when I saw this book used for a few dollars, I couldn't resist purchasing it.  Unfortunately, I haven't had a lot of time to make any of the other recipes, but since I do cook, I can tell there are a lot of quality recipes in the book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have this app on my Kindle fire.  I can see my local weather whenever I want and keep informed of all weather conditions.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The Kindle process can be easy or difficult. This book gives you some of the most solid and basic information to get rolling on your new Kindle book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the ending! I can't wait to see if the movie will match the book. I hope it will be as exciting!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My friends recommended this trilogy, I usually don't read romantic/sex books, this had me hooked from the get go. I'm pleased with the characters even though the 2nd protagonist is quite peculiar, the main protagonist is not too opposite from him, well I hope the next books don't disappoint me. My friends didn't seem to pleased from the last book. I'll see our for my self.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Great finish to the series. I would recommend this book to anyone. Makes me wonder about the future.... Who knows
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I had not read a Clancy book in years and the good reviews convinced me to try this one.  The original books like Hunt for Red October were outstanding.  While this book doesn't quite get to that level, I still found it to be an enjoyable read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I thought it was pretty good. Not nuts about the romantic struggle, but loved the struggles between the Rebels and the Capitol.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|I did really enjoy this movie.  I have not read the book.  I think there are a lot of guys who like movies like this sometimes even though they get labelled &#34;Chick Flicks&#34; by some of those same guys.  This is one of the best.  It's for anyone who needs a little romance fix, whether you're feeling up or down.  I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could.  My mother reads all of N. Sparks books and I know she loved this movie and will watch it again, and probably again, on occasion.  She'd give it 5 Stars, so I'm giving it to her as a gift.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It shut off every now and then but it is definitely better than the first one more...advanced in a way
B009VB97EY|5.0|Magic Mike was good. Something to start off the new year with. Channing Tatum is very sexy as usual.  The story isn't what I expected, but I loved the dances and music they used.  Excellent movie for Channing Tatum fans.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game great to waste time. If you really love horses this would be your game, its all bout horses.
0425252868|5.0|This book is an amazing story. It is difficult to imagine how a German pilot, who shot down hundreds of Allied planes and killed countless Americans, could be cast as a sympathetic character, but Franz Stigler is just that. The brutality of war, is waged by men and boys who no matter what side they fought for, in another more peaceful time, would have been teachers, priests, farmers, and engineers, and are and were husbands, brothers, sons and friends. This wonderful story about courage, and humanity is beautifully told and makes one rethink what heroism is. The book is highly recommended.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Saw this at Sundance and have already pre-ordered my copy.  I think this is going to be on the best documentaries of the year.  The direction and editing were awesome and the music blew me away.  Paul McCartney still has it as does Rick Springfield and Stevie Nicks!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really think this is a great game! Love it! I think people of any age would enjoy this great game!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Marvelous cast - Dame Judi Dench is always brilliant.  Plot was interesting and entertaining.  Young actor was quite good and I felt sorry for all he was trying to do to save hotel.  Means he played his part convincingly
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Wife isn't an electronics  kind of girl but loves her Kindle Fire 8.9. She loves Angry Birds! Giggles and works on this game for hours. No joke.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I did a up grade on my computer, had not to much<br />money, so did a lot of reading about what would<br />work best for me, the AMD FX 4100 4-core processor,<br />at 3.6 runs all games nice, with a ASUS mother board,<br />and a GTX 670 video card, all games on high, the fun<br />just keeps going on and on
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|5 stars I love fantasy and romance.  This was the best combination of both. Can't wait to read the next one.
B009YU9J0E|2.0|there are no clear lyrics to be heard and every voice is overlayed so many times that you can almost say this is an intrumental album with some voice sampling added.  i'm not sure who would play this in their car driving to work or out with friends?
1451627297|4.0|I'm a Stephen King fan.  Had I not been, I'm not sure I'd made it to the second half of this novel.  It would have been my loss.<br /><br />While 11/22/63 gets bogged down after wrapping you up early in the time travel plot to save Kennedy, it comes to life as the main character makes repeated attempts to fight through the past.<br /><br />The fiction intertwines with the history of Kennedy, Oswald, and Dallas in the early sixties, making a thrilling and entertaining finish.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|Just got started on Michael Connelly and love all the assets and flaws of Harry Bosch.  And the mysteries in each book so far have held my interest until the end.
0345536886|5.0|I've recently become a fan of John Grisham.  Go figure.  He's been writing books for years, and I just now discover him.<br /><br />I know just enough about law and the process of law to be dangerous, but Grisham wraps you gently into the jargon of the profession making you think you know more than you do.<br /><br />The Litigators is a fun, somewhat tongue in cheek, book about a blue blood, young lawyer who couldn't take the pressure of his high pay, high profile job, only to land in a practice with two ambulance-chasing attorneys.<br /><br />His disdain for the politics and pressure of his previous job makes him overly tolerant of the abysmal conditions he finds at his new office.  It's kind of a city mouse moves to the country story with the country  being filled with moonshiners and cockfighters.<br /><br />The story pulls you willingly through to the end.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Save your money or if you absolutly have to see it, rent it somewhere else cheaper than on here.  Somewhere where they will charge $0.01 so you wont feel like you just spent 1.5hrs for nothing.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|I am satisfied with the zip sleeve I purchased with my Kindle Fire.  It quite adequately serves the purpose for which it was designed..
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Really funny movie, I could watch it over and over! And I've already watched it three times! Songs are great, very funny cast.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I didn't even think I liked the Violin!<br />I certainly never listened to it on a daily basis anyway, that has certainly changed after listening to Lindsey.<br />Like many other I first saw her music video \\"Crystallize\\". It was probably my favorite youtube video that I had seen in a long time, shortly after<br />I watched a video on \\"freddiew's\\" channel and the behind the scenes video and noticed that it was Lindsey playing link in the video.<br /><br />I had to rush over and go check out more of her work, and absolutely love it! Lindsey... her talent, personality, there is simply no one like her, you MUST give this a listen.<br />\\"Shadows\\" has to be my all time favorite track.<br /><br />I've already booked VIP to see her March 18th, I could've bought a signed CD from her website, however... I would much rather have her sign it in person.<br />This will be my first concert and I'm sure thanks to Lindsey, it won't be my last.
B007HO392S|4.0|I love this CD! I have not been able to take it out of my CD player since I got it!
B009UNGYHG|5.0|What a wonderful idea! I love it.. I charge it up before I leave to go out of town & it is always ready after charging overnight.. I LOVE IT!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is the longest running game and the best ever it is so much better than temple run 1.
0765325950|1.0|I hoped for a satisfying conclusion to the Wheel of Time series.  I wasn't expecting something akin to the wonderful first four novels , but since Sanderson's previous two offerings  had been workmanlike if uninspired, I thought the last in the series might be at least readable and provide a more or less satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />In A Memory of Light, Sanderson has acheived the feat of reducing Jordan's fascinating characters, the great strength of the series, to cardboard.  Battle scenes, supposedly a Sanderson specialty, were numbingly boring, dialogue was trite.  The ending was simply not credible.  We are supposed to believe that Rand in this incarnation accomplished with two companions what earlier required a hundred warriors using maximum force?  It is apparently not considered polite to mention editing, as that task was done, or not done, by Jordan's wife, but I think editing has been a serious problem throughout this series, especially in the later novels. Many of the faults which appear regularly after Lord of Chaos, such as the proliferation of characters with similar names, the excessive descriptions of dress and decor, and the repetition of certain phrases and excessive use of the interjection 'though' might have been corrected by a competent editor.  It is almost as if the Wheel of Time had had three authors, Jordan, Sanderson, and an editor/writer who leaned heavily toward the banal and sentimental.<br /><br />For me the greatest disappointment, other than the ending, was leaving unresolved the mystery of why now?  What event or events caused the seals to weaken in the first place?  Jordan nowhere implied that the cause was the mere passage of time, and other cuendillar artifacts suffered no like corruption.  I thought Jordan had salted the previous novels with clues to suggest that an explanation would be forthcoming.  It would have had, I think, something to do with a Darkfriends revolt several centuries earlier, in which Cadsuane Sedai and possibly Verin Sedai as well, was somehow involved and in which Pevara Sedai lost her family.  I also wondered if Setalle Anan's true identity might not have been revealed as part of that explanation. All of this, and a lot more seem to have quite gone over Sanderson's head.<br /><br />I read through about half of MOL, then skipped to the end to see if the ending might redeam what came earlier, and the ending was even worse than what had come before!  Has a movie or TV series deal already been signed?  Was this last novel dumbed down for TVland?  The thing reads almost like a bad TV script, featuring lots of special effects, gory battle scenes, roles for several handsome leading men and wicked babes and an up to date coniving career-woman identity for Egwene to keep feminist critics happy.
B00007GZR5|1.0|A friend reccommended this so I bought it as she told me it was a great movie. I watched it twice and it just doesn't make sense to me and it surly is somebody's dream.  Not a good one either more of a nightmare.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Wow such a great tool to not understand my self better but also those I work with. I highly recommend buying this for your friends family or co workers/ employes
B004QMRHHW|5.0|Definite Buy - This is an awesome album! Especially Tracks 1 through 4. This is the ultimate return of true Metal!!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great book. Lot of new things from Nicholas sparks so I was really surprised by it. Very good book all around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 3 year old loves it! It keeps her busy for a good 20 minutes. Wish the unicorn is more attainable
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|HOPELESS was Beautiful and suspenseful. I highly recommend this book. Definitely a &#34;don't want to put down&#34; read. I loved it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This App is very easy to use.  It allows me to search for extras in Shelfari (which my Kindle Fire doesn't).  The only issue I have with this App AND Kindle Fire is that they don't have the text to voice ability like my original Kindle Keyboard 3G/WiFi.  Either that or I just haven't found the way to do it.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|The app's alarm does not work unless the app is open. I've tried multiple times to get it to wake me up in the mornings, but it never goes off.
B00123B9TU|4.0|Preface: As far as I am concerned, Rush has never released an album/CD/DVD, etc. which rates fewer than three stars.  Released in 1993, Counterparts was the last Rush album to employ their synthesized & orchestrated sound of the 1980's style.  If you prefer Rush's harder edge sound from &#34;Test for Echo&#34; and later, Counterparts might be too &#34;soft&#34; for you, with the exception of the first two tracks, &#34;Animate&#34; and &#34;Stick It Out,&#34; which are excellent, tough, rock songs.
1449410243|4.0|I bought this book for my son and daughter and we began &#34;fighting&#34; over it the moment it arrived. You will highly enjoy if you love cats.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|My daughter got me hooked on this show. Some of the things that happen in this season, I didn't see coming. Can't wait to see season 5..
1476719071|4.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  When I first started reading I was hooked, however when Travis and Abby became more than friends is when the story became a back and forth ping pong match of breaking up/getting back together; I'm mad at him/I love him, etc. resulting in a toxic, obsessive unhealthy relationship.  Once the story took this turn I became frustrated.  I felt like Abby was constantly playing a game when all along she knew what she wanted, yet held out because she knew in the end she would get what she wanted regardless because Travis was infatuated with her.<br /><br />Different events that happened in the book were interesting to me and I personally liked the back and forth conversations between characters.  I even found the characters interesting; would I want to know any of them....probably not, I don't care for that much drama.  Many times while reading I actually vocalized my irritations and shock.  Even though I would not consider this a favorite it struck a nerve and I found myself obsessing over it during class when I should have been listening to lecture.  Now that I've finished the book, I hope to pay attention next class.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love the way he tells a story and the inspiration his characters have on each other and on the reader. This book is the gift of learning an inspiring lesson. A new thought for how you look at each day.
0525478817|2.0|This was just another usual teen young love book. I don't understand what the sudden crazy hype over this book is all about. It's worth reading at least once in your life, but not something to craze over about.<br /><br />Overall: Witty & funny, but MUCH TOO overrated.
B004RZGUBM|3.0|Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors.  I have read several of his novels, and I assumed they are all contained in this book.  However, I had been unable to find them, since there is no list of them in the contents.  There is one for his short stories and his plays; but none for his novellas, collaborative works, his plays, his non-fiction, the adaptations, criticisms or biographies--although clicking the GO TO button tells me they are all there.  After much difficulty, however, I finally discovered where the book's table of contents was:  It is right after the cover.  I would have found it sooner, but at least on my PaperWhite Kindle you cannot click on the cover unless your search originates there!  The only way I found was to GO TO the Beginning, then BACK UP several pages until--voila! We come to the table of contents!  Why I can't just GO TO the table of contents is beyond me.  Anyway, the content gets a 5, the access TO it gets a 1, so it averages out to a 3.  Too bad!
045122499X|5.0|Book arrived within a decent time frame and was of very good quality.<br />Had read Follet's first writing and have enjoyed this sequel greatly.
B00433TO52|4.0|You can't go wrong with Shakespeare's complete works, including his best biographies, for $1.99.  I would have given it 5 stars for content alone, but in order to get at that content, you need a good table of contents.  There actually is one, but you won't find it under the GO TO button.  I finally found it.  You go to the cover, and then turn the page.  There it is!  You're welcome.  Would recommend this book to anyone who loves Shakespeare.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I purchased this book when it was on sale @ $3.99.  It was definitely worth it.  It kept me interested and wanting to read more.  Not sure I like the ending, but it was good.  I will for sure purchase more books from Gillian Flynn.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|Bought two, one for each car and person.  Not an expert and couldn't get the multiple phones to work and got tired of trying.  One worked fine out of the box and the other had to be charged.  There were NO instructions stating that the unit needs to be charged so I don't know if we got a returned item with a discharged battery or what.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is one of the most intriguing books I have read in a while. It captured my attention from the first sentence to the last one.<br />I thought the book was well written and very thought provoking.
0061122416|4.0|The book came in pretty good condition. The corner was bent a bit, but it was to be expected for the small price I paid for it.
0425263908|1.0|Comparing '50 Shades of Grey' to 'Bared to You' is like comparing a Ferrari to a Toyota.<br />This is NOTHING like '50 Shades of Grey' that I enjoyed so much. The only reason I read through it is to see if it gets any better as the pages turn. Sadly, it does not.<br /><br />First, the writing is simply awful! The characters are not convincing at all and don't develop as the book progresses, and the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere.<br />Second, You definitely don't feel the attraction or the love that develops (unlike FSoG), so the book is a collection of random scenes that don't connect.<br />Third, even the sex scenes that the other reviews talk about are so sleazy, they felt like scenes coming from a cheap porn movie.<br /><br />In addition, and to make matters worse -- clearly Ms. Day rearranged the events and characters of FSoG to form this book. There is NOTHING original in it! She even used the same phrases and characters' lines.. Pathetic!<br />Seriously, I'm surprised E L James hasn't sued for plagiarism (if she hasn't already done so).<br /><br />If you enjoyed '50 Shades of Grey' - please do yourself a favor and skip this book. I'm seriously considering reading the Fifty Shade trilogy all over again just to forget about this horrible experience.
0446554995|2.0|I have read all of Preston and Childs books and have found them to be exceptional.  This book was just a little unbeleiveable for me and I was just not interested enough to finish it,  which is a first for one of their novels.  They usually pull off unbeleiveable quite well but maybe it was the frame of mind I was in at the time.  I would like to see them get on with the series and forget this bs about a non existing wife and her past that is just too far feached for me to give serious thought to. This one brings to mind Charlane Harris and her stupid dribble.  She started off great and then went on to write some of the most senseless crap ever produced.  Lets hope Preston and Child don't fall into that trap.

B00AMBK0X4|3.0|all my friends were telling me how hilarious it was, and yes watching mark wahlberg get high with a talking teddybear is entertaining, after about a half hour it was all about relationship problems.. and im sick of those movies.. all in all not worth the $4 i spent, but i couldnt get it to work on the pirate sites.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I found Life of Pi to be a garbled piece of inconsequential ramblings, rather than the story I expected.  After trudging through the first two chapters, I gave up on the so called story, something I have only done on extremely rare occasions.  Unless you enjoy the masochism of relevant religious rantings, I do not suggest wasting either your money or your time on this book.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This one has a few quirks but after i learned what they were i found it to be a great game
B00899F0G8|5.0|I loved this show when it first came out. I started school so i got behind, but i started watching again and couldn't stop. It keeps you intertwined between so many different things keeping you guessing and interested. I love this show and recommend it to anyone.

B000V6BE6M|5.0|Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings Score is some of my favorite music of any kind ever. Absolute brilliance.<br /><br />It's just such a shame that these Complete Recordings are so hard to find.<br /><br />The Return of the King ones are available as MP3 downloads, which is good, but Fellowship of the Ring is only available on a rather pricey CD, and The Two Towers is totally OOP, fetching prices upwards of $180!<br /><br />What's a poor fan to do?
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great story, it all took some time for everything to unravel but overall it all made sense and<br />  it touched my heart
B000BNI90O|5.0|Howard Shore's Lord of the Rings music is some of the best music of any kind ever created.<br /><br />It's just such a shame that these Complete Recordings are so hard to come by. This Fellowship of the Ring one was rather pricey.<br /><br />Return of the King is as well, although it at least has the option of just downloading the MP3 album.<br /><br />The Two Towers set is OOP, never to be found again, it seems for less than almost $200.
B00466HM28|3.0|It worked fine for a few weeks, then it just stopped working. I believe it had something to do with the usb connection. Waiying for my new one to come in the mail now.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Hooked on Downton and this was a great way to catch up on missed episodes!  Thanks for this option for viewing.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|kindle cover was exact fit and was perfect for my new Kindle.  the hard case is gives the feeling of security in case something happens.  the stand in the back is the greatest feature, it allows me to read without holding the kindle.  Love it!!
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album is constantly on repeat for me. Sigh No More definitely set the bar high, and I think this is a great follow up album! Just listen for yourself, I mean, who doesn't love a banjo riff~~
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|Great story. Problem with third DVD.  Quite irritating to miss half of episode 7. Will be returning .  Pain in the neck.
0547884591|2.0|I didn't realize this was like a survivalist how-to book with tons of really weird and unusual and for me generally  useless information.  I thought it was going to be a regular how-to cook book, like The Joy of Cooking or something like that.  Instead it has chapters on how to slaughter a rabbit, how to start a charcoal cookstove in the woods--so maybe it would be useful for grown-up eagle scouts or hardline campers or something.  But I just don't get it, I don't like it, I don't want it, I'm going to try to send it back.  If you're some kind of back country geek or survivalist or I don't know what, you might like it.  But it's big, it's got a lot of pages, it's heavy, it's hard-bound, it's probably good for a doorstop if you  need one.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I had a little trouble getting to the game and figuring out directions. Several others tried it and had similar complaints. Once there, the aiming lines were helpful.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very good with all of the detail and intelligence I've come to expect from Clancy. Great to have Jack Ryan back.
B005VPRET4|5.0|Their Legos....what can i say other than I don't like how costly they are. My daughter was very pleased. Glad they finally make them for girls.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander provides expert evidence of God and heaven from his first person report of a NDE (Near Death Experience). Not discussed in his book is the suggestion that future neurology research might allow a medically control coma to suspend the neo-cortex functionally and permit heavenly visitations...much as did the infectious disease that attacked Dr. Alexander. Read this educational and inspiring book.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Its a twitter app it works. I have not had any problems with it and I don't expect too. Basic app that gets the job done.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Most captivating episode of the entire show!! It was suspenseful, heart wrentching, humorous, and once again leaves you begging for more!

B005G5PPGS|5.0|Best book I've read in years!  Besides being very funny, I learned more about baseball form this book than from watching the talking heads sports pundits for 40 years.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had this game for 2 freaking minutes and I love it so much like seriously it is really addictive and fun so seriously, try it out, any bad reviews are crazy!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|more of the same stuff that made the first temple run great and more bonuses that improve this version of it
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I ordered this for my boyfriend who is a Blu-Ray collected and he absolutely LOVED IT! It is an amazing gift and worth every penny!  FOR THOSE ARE BLU-RAY special edition collectors and Walking Dead fans, this is a MUST HAVE!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|The Bourne Legacy  love this movie  Jeremy Renner is fantastic in it. would love to see a sequial of this movie with Jeremy Renner in it again.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Ok. It was awesome. For about 16 runs.<br />After that, it would never open. I had to delete it and reopen it,  but even that didn't work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great time filler when your brain needs to numb out for a while. Would prefer no advertisements, but I understand they are necessary.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app has very great graphics! The app could use a few updates but overall it is a very very nice app! I hope that you like this app as much as I did
B0083SBJXS|5.0|LOVE this movie. It really is one of the best superhero movies to come out in a long time. Even if you aren't a fan of superhero stuff, you should definitely check it out because it's super fun and good for the whole family.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read!!!<br /> It has an amazing ending and an entertaining/action-packed middle!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like that I get the weather right away without having to wait.  Accurate current temps, good forecasts and timely warnings.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|omg I love this game it takes a minimal amount to download but<br />there are not many songs but very addictive.
0345803493|5.0|Loved the love story between Grey and Ana. If we all could have just a little gray in our lives.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This it app will tell you EVERYTHING you need to know about your battery life. It states the percentage of your battery and other stuff like how much time it has for games reading browsing video playback talktime camera and so much more. Definitely worth the money.  Ps. My kindle keyboard wont let me put any commas so that's why there aren't any.
0345803507|5.0|just started reading part 3 love the whole series looking forward to the ending to be wonderful. Wow Wow Wow
B009FZFONO|5.0|This show just sucks you in leaving you wanting more at the end of each episode. I had watched the first two seasons and was hooked.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is a very good show in my opinion.  I love the actors and found it originally on Netflix.  Watched every show from the first one and was hooked like a good book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|all the games are fun. sometimes it is hard ti figure them out but you get used to it. I'm addicted
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The movie was OK but not anywhere near great.  I'm generally tired of the &#34;angst filled self-doubting hero&#34; type characters that are so common and Batman in this movie is no exception.  However, the most irritating thing about the movie was the OWS language spouted by just about every character in the movie.  I've seen the movie three times now and it gets more irritating with every viewing.  There are also many logical flaws in the movie's plot which I won't detail.<br /><br />On the plus side.  The last section of the movie where Batman finally gets his butt in gear is good.  I found the ending very good and satisfying.
B00AKOB7CG|3.0|Great workout for free. Timed intervals, basic instructions, but this and the other workout apps give a baseline routine for those working to get fit and workout virtually anywhere.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game.  It is the best game in the whole wide wold.  If you are thinking about geting this game you should get it as fast as you can.  It starts out to be kind of slow and boring and you would want to delete it but you should not.  Then it gets faster and better.  You get to compete.
B00969PR18|1.0|When I searched for addresses, it consistently came up with California. I can't figure out how to get the right address, much less get directions.
B0085MNZ66|5.0|This game is great- the graphics may look quite basic but that makes them not distract from the puzzle itself. I'm stuck on puzzle 15 but I'm enjoying going back to it to try other solutions - I know I'll get there and it'll be really satisfying to crack it. I don't think it needs instructions- the first few puzzles demonstrate how to play and it's kind of cool to discover new tricks yourself. I'd recommend it to anyone with a decent attention span and a determination to persevere when things get a bit tricky!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel!  As someone who has played World of Warcraft, has participated in the virtual world of Second Life and is a former high school teacher, I felt the world Cline creates is very plausible and I could relate to it.<br /><br />The characters were so likeable, real, and well developed it made me care about what happens to them.  I had a hard time putting this one down.  This novel was very well written and I look forward to reading more of his work.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks did a great job, I could could not put the book down. Can not wait for the movie, hope that is just as good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|i also play more than i should...<br />this is a fun, intuitive game to use!<br />thanks for your hardwork keeping us happy.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I liked this book because sara Shepard did a great job keeping you hooked to the mystery. And she did great with the A texts.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This games is awesome and my brother loves this game and my little cousin doesn't stop playing this game and when he has to leave he just starts crying cause he loves this game so much we'll..bye
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. It has a wonderful perspective on contrasts - the contrasts between the classes (servants and masters), the clash between the old ways and the new. Maggie Smith is amazing. British drama at it's best!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I am not a devotee of electronic books, but this was convienent to read on my tablet.  The mechanics of reading in this format are pretty good.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|I love the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" movies, especially the first two. However, I didn't see this one in the theater, because I wasn't a fan of the planet of Apes remake with Mark Wahlberg. I assumed this might be more of the same.<br /><br />Well, I just saw this movie the other day on HBO and I was very pleased. I loved the costumes from the original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and I have been a long time hater of CGI, but I have to say they did a phenomenal job with the CGI in this movie. The Apes look nearly perfect and the CGI also allows for a perfect blend of animal behavior and human features and emotions that fit perfectly.<br /><br />In sum, this movie is a very worthy sequel to the originals. While most of todays movies are mind numbing shock value, \\"rise of the apes\\" is a return to smart sci-fi with plot and imagination. My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit rushed after the slow moving build up and that the violence was a bit too tame. Still, I loved what they did in this movie to evolve the series and I was left wanting to see more. Hopefully we get another sequel
B0012GTZC0|5.0|The good guys win, or die nobly for the cause; the bad guy (spoiler alert) finally gets the death he deserves.  It's a Follett, so you know the characters are well drawn and compelling, the history is eye-opening and the plot will keep you reading well into the night.  Highly recommended.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I just got a kindle fire and saw this game.thought I would give it a try..so far this game<br />Is fun and enjoyable. I find it entertaining , good graphics, good sound, and its just<br /> the best.
0385535139|5.0|John Grisham is my all-time favorite mystery write.  His stories are action packed and full of drama.  Once I start reading one of his books, I can hardly put the book down until it is finished.  Love him.
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|This game is pretty fun and challenging. It combines some elements I have seen in other games to create something unique. There are too few levels right now, but they say there are more coming.
B005USZYDU|5.0|Again, a great book but then everything Grisham writes is great.  Not just for kids either.  Full of action and makes parents wish they had a son like Theo.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|We are a “Lego family” - my boys are now 13 and they pretty much grew up on Legos.  What this means is that we own many Lego sets!!  And 99.99% of the sets we own were purchased for my boys, and were built by my boys.  This set, however, I built - I’m known as Dad - and I am not 13 anymore!! This set just brought back memories and I had to build it!!<br /><br />Bottom line -it was a lot of fun to build, and it I have had it displayed in my office ever since I built it (which is over a year now)!<br /><br />Another five star set from Lego in my opinion!!  Great attention to detail overall… very cool set.  There were a couple of sections of the build that took a little extra care (like the roof) and took careful handling / pressure.  The roof might be one of the reasons this set would not be the best for an 8 year old... but that is why is clearly says 16+ years old on the box… then again, there are many eight year old Lego geniuses out there… I should speak for myself!<br /><br />Great set, highly recommended!
0385535147|4.0|Just starting reading this novel and again I find it hard to put the book down until I have finished it.
B0015AARJI|4.0|First off, we own three of these controllers.  Second, they are used by my sons, and we purchased two five years ago, and one more three years ago.  My sons are 13 now - and considering all three controllers we purchased are still being used and still working fine - that speaks light years to their durability and quality.  Anytime a product lasts five years, and started with 8 yr olds, it is worthy of praise.<br /><br />I knocked a star off for price - if I wasn't feeling so gouged on price I would probably be more magnanimous on the rating!!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book may be for kids, but I love it and would recommend it to my adult friends as well as my teen ager friends.
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|In 1983 or 1884--its been a while--I went to a Buddy Guy concert at the Howard St. in Omaha, just a hole in the wall club and with the other half a dozen fortunates there heard one of the finest blues shows ever in Omaha. He impressed me as an amazing guitarist (and I got to see Junior Wells as well!)--to this day Buddy Guy struck me as the greatest guitar player in the American tradition I have ever seen.<br />Over the years, I have bought Buddy Guy CDs and LPs on occasion--in a futile search for one that would even begin to capture the memory of that live show. I don't understand it. Maybe the producers were terrified of the real Buddy Guy the raw great pure noise the man could make. Fools.<br />Yeah he's won a lot awards and yeah they stuck him in a lot of hall of fames and all that but still--he was just better live<br />And now this CD comes along. Yeah. This is the Buddy Guy I Remember. This is the guy whose guitar was literally twice as loud as the rest of the band. This is the genius who just depended on pure inspiration his pure genius to make his guitar sing.<br />This is an absolutely incredible CD. The live portion is about the length of a single set in a club. Amazing.<br />This is a must own CD.<br />Now let me quickly express my annoyance with several of the negative reviews here. The sound on this CD is EXACTLY what I remember at his live show. His guitar is just CRANKED! to the point the other instruments are fighting to be heard. That's how it should be. SO the sound is great.<br />Yes believe it or not Buddy and the guy who announce him use a couple of four letter words. Hey I'm the practicing Catholic, I'm not offended, this is a guy who wrote the song Damn Right I've got the Blues. You guys must be nuts.<br />If you don't love this CD, well, I am afraid you may not be ready for the blues. Maybe you should seek out another genre of music. The Sandpipers are still in print you know.<br />Ciao.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Super way to zone out and kill some time.  Gets me through the minutes waiting in doctor's lobbies and for my kids to finish their activities.
B00A8PXS42|4.0|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She must have about 15 Barbies and they all fit, plus some of their stuff.  We had the best time the other day staging all the Barbies around the play set.  The sides were very easy to zip up and down.  Would clean up easily if anything got on in.  Not really the sturdiest if you have a child that is hard on her toys.  Was definitely a worthwhile purchase for my girl.
B008UTV6S8|5.0|If you are a Paul Simon fan you must own this!  If you don't have a copy purchase one immediately!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A must play game. I was worried I wouldn't like this game but started playing and I can't put it down!
0525478817|2.0|I got this book under the impression that it was a good read due to the numerous good reviews it received. How wrong I was. The characters were so unrealistic and used language that kids that age would never use. I felt like the love between Hazel and Augustus was like puppy love and a bit rushed. I also did not like the fact that the author put down other cancer books and congratulated himself on making a \\"successful\\" one. So unless you're a twelve-year-old girl, do not waste your time on getting this book.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Glad I could be taken back to old sim city thru this game. A must play.. and free play. DOWNLOAD it and enjoy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's like your taking care of a real horse!It is so fun if you don't have a horse and it is still fun if you do
B004DM0UII|5.0|I can say that this is one of the best radio apps that I've used.  There are tons of different radio stations for your listening pleasure.  You are guaranteed to find something that you like. It's a quality app that I have had no issues with. Also, If you're worried about permissions, just email the developer or go to their website.  The developer is very responsive, which is rare sometimes, with other developers.  Also those sticky intents permissiosn is not only on this app, it's on other apps as well - especially apps that have an alarm function, such as this one.  At $4, this app is a deal. Pandora is $36 per year (with no ads).
B0050R0YB8|5.0|This thing is awesome. The build takes probably about 10-15 hours and overall the model is very stable and looks great. This thing is huge, it is 49 inches tip to tail so if you go this route be prepared to have sufficiently large space to display it. There is zero playability with this model, the stands attached to the model and the thing weighs 10-13lbs. This means there is zero swooshability with it.<br /><br />This model looks awesome in my living room.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|great game you can eaisly play this game for hours.  puzzles are challanging and fun. could not put the game down til I finished it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not really my cup of tea,but it sounded so interesting that I figured I would give it a try. This is actually the first book I have purchased for my kindle, all others over the past year I have gotten free. So glad I took a chance, this series is fantastic. I think what made it so good is that it is totally believable that something like that could happen. Thank you for a great story.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Did not respond (crashed kindle) and created pop up ads. Ask to install other programs.  Uninstalled it after 1 day.
B00632HWOG|5.0|easy to use and really reliable. no problems for a geek like me lol....i even have it on my ipod to where i can access it easily to keep up with my emails.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Great Movie A classic.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I forgot how much I loved this movie, and it actually stands up really well considering the technology available to the filmakers at the time.
B000I3PERS|5.0|I bought the bluray here on Amazon and they gave me a 24 hour rental of the movie for free!!
0062213423|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it! I have even read some of it and it is very informative. I would recommend this book to others.
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Why BEATLES PAST MASTERS?<br /><br />Not even looking at the \\"international\\" releases of The Beatles albums during their days together in the studio, just between the UK and USA, the Beatles album discography was a complicated matter, especially in the early period of their first four UK albums.  The Beatles hated what the USA Capitol Records did with their albums, especially since they spent a lot of effort in sequencing the songs on their \\"official\\" albums as released in the UK.  The early USA corporate market insisted on 5 or 6 songs per side on record albums and in Britain, 7 songs per side was the order of the day.  Beatles fans like me had to buy Yesterday And Today, and Hey Jude to gain access to just some of the songs left off our American counterpart Beatles albums.  On the other hand, in the UK, Magical Mystery Tour was an EP and in the USA it was an LP!  And that my friends was only the tip of the iceberg.  In the 70's I set out to make sure I purchased import versions of all my Beatles albums to replace my aged Capitol collection (except for the Apple releases beginning with Pepper).  But that did not complete the studio recordings collection and it was downright frustrating!  Fast forward to 1988, all of the Beatles original UK studio version releases (and the full album version of Magical Mystery Tour) are available on both vinyl and the new CD format and we want our Beatles back catalogue in a \\"box\\".  Enter preeminent and noted Beatles authority Mark Lewisohn who with George Martin compile The Beatles Past Masters volumes I and II, which together with the 13 original full album releases now offers die-hard fans a Compleat Beatles collection in music.  Past Masters adds all of the Beatles A and B-side singles not appearing on albums, including the alternate single releases on songs which did appear on albums; it includes the four songs from the UK-only release EP \\"Long Tall Sally\\", the two German language releases of Beatles songs, one American Market only single release, and a Charity single release not ever available before on a Beatles record.  If you have not purchased a Beatles Box, whether the original box or the 2009 Stereo Box, if you purchased the individual Beatles CD releases, on your own time and money in your own order, and you want to complete your collection, Past Masters are a must have!<br /><br />From Volume I:<br /><br />Love Me Do is the original Parlophone single version recorded on September 4th, 1962. (the Please Please Me album version is from the September 11th re-recording session with Alan White on drums and Ringo on tambourine).  There was quite a phenomenal amount of discourse over this song, it has become legendary but the studio recordings for rock and roll in the day basically (quite nearly) demanded that the bass and drum units \\"lock in\\", so later pressings of the single and the album release were from the September 11th session, whereas this version on Past Masters I, is the much looser recording in line with the R&B feel which was just beginning to emerge in 1962 and that which The Beatles were initially after!  Blame it on George Martin, but Ringo was quite vexed at this initial recording faux-pas, and it can be left to the listener to decide which version is better, or if it matters at all.  Then there are the A/B side releases of From Me To You/Thank You Girl, She Loves You/I'll Get You, I Want To Hold Your Hand/This Boy; the German language (novelty) releases of I Want To Hold Your Hand and She Loves You; the four brilliant songs from the Long Tall Sally EP, Long Tall Sally, I Call Your Name, Slow Down, Matchbox; the June 1965 USA-Only release of Bad Boy; and the two B-sides from Ticket To Ride and Help!: Yes It Is and I'm Down.  All of these songs (save possibly the German versions, but even they have an original stereo track not available on the English versions ever to this day) are must-haves for Beatles music lovers, and it's simply insane to not to want this album as part of your collection.<br /><br />From Volume II:<br /><br />The fantastic double-A-side of Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out; A/B singles: Paperback Writer/Rain, Lady Madonna/The Inner Light, Hey Jude/Revolution, Get Back/Don't Let Me Down, The Ballad Of John & Yoko/Old Brown Shoe, Let It Be/You Know My Name; and the beautiful \\"wildlife version\\" of Across The Universe from the rare multi-artist charity album No One's Gonna Change Our World.  Of this collection you might think a number of these songs actually are on Beatles albums, but there is marked difference between these singles and the album versions.  It is almost a given that most people know the difference between the shockingly fast and electric Revolution versus the \\"white album\\" largely acoustic and much slower paced (and often more appreciated).  But, there are also significant and fundamental differences between the single and album versions of songs from Let It Be.  Firstly, Get Back, the single version, credited to The Beatles with Billy Preston, contains a tape echo effect throughout and a coda after a false ending, with the lyrics \\"Get back Loretta / Your mommy's waiting for you / Wearing her high-heel shoes / And her low-neck sweater / Get back home, Loretta.\\" This does not appear on the album version and both just have a general feel about them which makes one appreciate both as different songs.  The rest of the difference can be attributed to Phil Spector's production on the album version.  Same \\"feel\\" goes for the title track of Let It Be.  Let It Be, the single contains orchestration and backing vocals overdubbed on 4 January 1970, administered by George Martin and Paul McCartney, with backing vocals that are the only known vocal contributions by Linda McCartney to a Beatles song.  Martin mixed the orchestration very low and a second George Harrison guitar solo, dropped from the single mix can only be heard faintly during the final verse.  The album version of Let It Be is strikingly different, from the guitar solo, and lacking backing vocals, to Ringo's hi-hat!  Enjoy them both for what they are!  The wildlife version of Across The Universe is simply the best and most beautiful version there is.  If there is one song that might not be appreciated by all, it is the comedy music hall number You Know My Name (Look Up the Number), but on the contrary it can be fully appreciated as one of the last times that John and Paul had so much fun working together!  Discover it, if you don't know it.<br /><br />Last Word:<br /><br />Beatles Past Masters are not a collection of cast-offs or hits, but are an integral part to a recording history that was complicated and frustrated (truly!) and as such, should be included in any Beatle fan's library.  If you are piecemeal building a Beatles collection I would almost recommend gathering these two before Please Please Me and With The Beatles.<br /><br />The journey doesn't end here either.  Beatles fans should avail themselves of the Anthology series, Let It Be...Naked, and The Beatles Love albums for true glorious fulfillment!art of your collection.<br /><br />From Volume II:<br /><br />The fantastic double-A-side of Day Tripper/We Can Work It Out; A/B singles: Paperback Writer/Rain, Lady Madonna/The Inner Light, Hey Jude/Revolution, Get Back/Don't Let Me Down, The Ballad Of John & Yoko/Old Brown Shoe, Let It Be/You Know My Name; and the beautiful \\"wildlife version\\" of Across The Universe from the rare multi-artist charity album No One's Gonna Change Our World.

Overall, I think Temple Run 2 two is a great game and is one of the best game purchases I have ever made, even though it is free.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|Not &#34;re-read because I loved it&#34;, rather &#34;re-read every other sentence to make sure I understood what the heck they were saying.&#34;<br /><br />No, I'm not a scholar. No, I don't have an MFA in writing. I like to read, and I like to write a little too. And although I can appreciate the elevated, time-accurate vocabulary used in this book, it was still a chore to read, which took quite a bit away from enjoying the stories inside.
B004X60QE2|4.0|What can I say, I received my dvd in a very short time.  Which I loved and have been watching my movie every chance I get.  I am a big fan of this show and now it's in my hands and I love it.  Thank you for having this move at a good price because with money being tight I am glad you had it at a price that I could afford and the shipping wasn't bad either.  Thank you for a great product and great timeing in getting the product to the coustomer.  Great Job, Keep up the Good Work!!  And yes, I have told other about your site.
B007THA4FI|2.0|You certainly get to know the characters well, over 15 of them, which is the bulk of the book. The underlying plot is pretty shallow, takes a long time to develop and it all comes crashing to an end in the last chapters.
0192802380|4.0|This book was on the reading list for school.  Great book and my son enjoyed reading it.  I ended up ordering three more books because the whole family read the book and talked about it.  I loved that I was able to get it at a great price and like always received my items in great time.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|This is amazing sounding. All the terrific songs remastered from the original Abbey Road album are recreated onto 180g of vinyl, which comes cleanly in a black cover inside the inspiring album cover. I've read where there have been audio problems, but I have had none with the record, and hope I never do because you know these guys are just that good.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I am not a movie or film critic so I have no comment on the artistic merits of Homeland Season 1. However, I can tell you that the Blu-Rays I received played perfectly in my Samsung Blu-Ray player.  There are three Blu-Rays in the pack and no scratches or malfunctions.  Five stars.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a great sequel to the other books. Hilarious and easy to read. I love this book and recommend this to everyone who loves a good comedy.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|This was a gift for a history buff.  Great price for the 2 disc set.  Arrived exactly when it said it would.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Ellen is funny! She says things we all would think but not say out loud.  Off the wall... Stupid funny!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I absolutely love this game.  There are very easy puzzles that can be solved quickly, and very difficult ones that will take you quite a while.  I like that the devs update the app with new puzzles pretty regularly.  If you are fat fingered like myself, the small squares can be touchy at times, but you can pinch zoom if needed.
B002N14GPE|5.0|Enjoyed it very much, caught me on the edge of my seat. I'd highly recommend. Hope I can see more movies like this one.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been so hooked up on ergonomics lately especially on how computer setups should ideally be like. This particular mouse does its part very well in contributing to the ergonomic environment I crave for.When you grasp the mouse, your thumb feels easily at home with the rubberized side of the mouse which is also durable (the rubber) if you ask me. You can easily customize this with the amount of buttons available on top and on the left side. The index and middle fingers feel right where they belong in comfortable manner, arched just the right slight angle on the left and right click buttons. Mouse speed is highly customizable as well and I really spent awhile till I got the perfect setting I want. Having the option to alter the mouse's weight was definitely a plus for me as I can help reduce stress on my hand while using it. You can change the color of the anchor logo only, the rest of the lights stay the same no matter what you do; which honestly doesn't matter to me. The price point for this mouse is definitely worth it. I don't usually spend past $30 for mice but I'm glad I actually took the risk of purchasing this product. Customer support for this is excellent as well. Know that when if you do decide to purchase this product you can rely on them if you encounter any problems.
0715338153|5.0|I love this little set of Tilda books!<br /><br />So cute & Whimsical and what fun I am going to have making all of them!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Pamela G.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|graet game for kids 2 years up to me at 59 years old.  we all play together and it is very fun.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|First off, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a beautiful coming-of-age piece for readers young and old. Even though it's a little cliché, Charlie's story reminded me of a less lonely version of Holden Caulfield of Catcher in the Rye. Stephen Chbosky captures perfectly the narration required to allow the reader to really emphasize with the main character through the universal trials of adolescence. Even if you're not a fan of Catcher in the Rye, Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower will surely be a story that sticks with you, regardless of whether you're currently fighting the good fight that is being a teenager or you've put those days behind you and are looking for a quick, meaningful read.
B005HSL626|4.0|purchased for grandkids and they love this game.almost all of them can play this. keeps them busy and happy for a long time.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Better than the last one. Lots of fun. At times it moves a little too fast. It would be nice to control that.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so much fun to play and it definitely great. Worth every penny. (Even though its free). It is worth the bucks.
B009329Y30|5.0|I would recommend The lucky One to anyone that enjoy's a great movie.Each moment of this movie is so great.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I chose this ratings because it was a dictionary that was boring and really dum regard it and the worst
B004IFYMWK|5.0|Fair Game was a wonderful movie. It is the kind of movie that you will want to  watch over and over.I am so grateful that dvd's are  can be purchased at amazon.
B0026772N8|5.0|I have fount the insight into a (Zen) lifstile and the story itself to be very wonderful and compelling.  this has become one of my favorite books.  one I will read time and time again.  I have loved being able to read it on my phone with my e copy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Every body should love this game if there into horses. This is a very good game i cant keep from playing it.
B007SGM084|5.0|The wife loved the gift. Delivery to device was easy and flawless. E-book works perfect, and convenient.thank you amazon. Bye
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This games is so much fun! I play it all the time. I'm addicted. It is better than the first one and I didn't even think that was possible. It has a lot of twists and turns. I always compete with my sister on who will go the farthest.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This series is not for everyone, but if you enjoy the post-apocalyptic genre, it's one of the best.  It has both high production value and excellent writing.  I consider it one of the best series on TV.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Book is great to inspire you to be financially independent, it does not give you answers for there are no answers. Just ways in which you create your own answer. I would recommend reading think and grow rich by Napoleon hill be4 reading this book.
859037985X|5.0|Lua is a free scripting language with an interesting development history. It is light, readable, expressive, fast, almost universally portable (being ANSI C) and easily integrated with C and C++. It is widely used as dedicated scripting language, general-purpose language, data-description language and to build domain-specific languages.<br /><br />Written by the chief architect of the language, \\"Programming in Lua\\" is aimed at programmers wishing to approach or to better understand Lua and the extra power offered by a fully dynamic language.<br /><br />Despite its deceptively small size and a plain, readable style with eye-resting typesetting, \\"Programming in Lua\\" packs an impressive amount of information peppered with small, clear code examples, supplemented in this new edition by practical exercises; it reminds me of my favorite programming book: the K&R (Kernighan and Ritchie's \\"The C programming language\\"). It is a multi-level book that always gives something new at every reading.<br /><br />Its four sections introduce capabilities, concepts and techniques that may surprise even seasoned programmers, especially those using static languages only.<br /><br />The first section is devoted to the language itself, including not-so-common subjects such as multiple results, first-class functions, closures, iterators and coroutines. The next section shows how to build all sorts of data structures, from simple arrays and lists to packages and objects, using Lua \\"tables\\" and the powerful idea of \\"metatables\\" that makes the language easily customizable.<br />The third section introduces the standard libraries (which are actually optional, e.g. in small embedded applications) with special emphasis on the simple but versatile pattern matching capabilities.<br /><br />The fourth and last section is different: aimed at system programmers, it explains in detail how to interface Lua and C, both to add new functions to Lua and to use Lua inside a C program (possibly called from programs written in other languages).<br /><br />This new edition of \\"Programming in Lua\\" covers version 5.2 of the language. I use Lua as a general-purpose fast and light language for system tasks and small programs, as data-description language and as embedded language inside C++ applications: the combined power of the two languages is impressive. I liked this book a lot, I learned much from it and I've assigned it a place of honor besides my well-thumbed K&R.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My seven year old loved, loved, loved it.  He got it for Christmas and immediately started playing with it.  And I still need to type one more words before I can submit. (insert rolling eyes here)
B004HD61KE|3.0|I enjoyed this one but it wasn't as engaging as the other Sigma novels I have read for some reason. So, 3.5 instead of 4 (do wish they let us do a half star, lol).
B002C6A6N6|4.0|I started watching the series on cable and decided to watch from beginning to end in order.  DVD arrived fast.  One of the spindles is broken, but not a big deal.  Box still closes.  Wholesome series even if not historically correct.  Good characterizations and would prefer my grand kids watch this over a lot of other programs.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It was a fun remake.  I had not read the book it was based on but the short story the original was based on &#34;Overdrawn at the Memory Bank&#34; by John Varley was pretty awesome.
B009ME47H2|4.0|This app is simple in design and function.  I'm using it on my Kindle Fire HD.  The playback volume, even while listening with a headset, is barely discernable, though the recording, itself, appears to have been properly obtained.  My estimation of this app is that it is more of a novelty and not useful in recording dictation, interviews, or musical performances.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Cute, engaging, but not stable on Kindle Fire HD.  Have lost progress TWICE, when game froze and then restarted at the beginning.  Did not have any issues with original Kindle Fire.  Gameloft customer service not helpful.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am totally addicted to these books and once I started, I couldn't put it down.  I can't wait to read Mockingjays! I just saw Hunger Games: The Movie and as usual, was disappointed.  The books are so much better than the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is one of my favorite books, makes me happy and makes me cry.  I have read it before and will read it again
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Very cute story. Predictable in a sense, but still loved the surprises! The characters are very easy to relate to.
B0089Q1TPM|3.0|Really nothing to write home about for extras. Just the movie on Blu-Ray. If you have another version save your money.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|If you get this version of the Skynet Edition, good. You're not missing anything in not getting the more expensive version with the Endoskeleton bust. All of those discs are on a spindle instead of separate cases or plastic pages within a single case. It takes up to much room, too. No extra content either, so if you're looking for the definitive Terminator 2: Judgment Day on Blu-ray, this is it. Trust me, I own both.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This app works exactly as I hoped & was very easy to set up. I can access all of my Google calendars (4 for the family + MLB, etc) at the same time, just as on the web. AND...I can access it when not connected to wi-fi.  I have added appointments while off-line and everything transfers perfectly.<br /><br />The Kindle's size and the promise of this kind of ready access to my calendars were the primary reasons for getting the Kindle vs iPad. Very happy with my choice!
B00B19DMUE|3.0|Just another possession movie nothing dramatic or rememberable.The story is done to death, no extreme scary scenes to actually impress you. The only thing that was new and different is that it was a Jewish spirit box that held the entity and a Rabbi exorcist coming to the rescue.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I mostly. like. it but I don't like that you have so.little energy. and it can be hard to earn money
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I always use the math problems in order to shut the alarm off. There's a difficulty setting on how hard you want the problems to be. When you just wake up, it gets your mind going and doing mental math. Great app, I highly recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game is fun- when it's not chopping  up. Almost every time I play it's very choppy and makes me lose!! It gets really annoying so i usually don't play.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|oh my goodness, if you are looking for a game like Mario Brothers, look no further! this game is awesome!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awesome and it is very addictive!  I have it on my kindle fire and the hours just melt away!  I would recommend this app to anyone that is looking for fun!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|who doesn't love facebook for keeping in touch with friends and family far and near and even in the next room,
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really good.Most people complain it needs more which it does but its fun!Its just an app they cant put too much stuff.Plus in 0.6.0 we will have armor signs and clouds.Still they should add redstone and buckets and bigger maps.If you want REAL fun than get pocketinveditor for cheating awesomeness.Overall,highly reccomended,minecraft fan or not!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|still not veery good at this I have to talk to people who know more about which birds do what and I thought bombs were a good thing ...see how little I know but fun playong learning and sharing with young nieces and nephews and my son who has moved on to hard core games
B003YL4LYI|4.0|The last (unfortunately) book of the series did not disappoint me and to some degree satisfied the nagging question &#34;what next?&#34;.  However at the end one is left with a &#34;world&#34; in turmoil, many characters still in process of reaching their goal. I wish I could force Mr. Martin to continue with this saga.
B00AH69ZN0|5.0|I am a big Metalica fan so of course this is at the top of my best music list to have on all my devices
B008M87GJK|5.0|Need to keep up with the world news but short on time?  BBC News is your solution.  Stay on top of world and domestic events and news in &#34;spare&#34; time, while at breakfast, coffee break, while in transit, ....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|really hard for me but fun for my much more game experienced son I will keep trying to improve my eye hand coordination which hopefully comes with practice overall great for those who are gamers and great for those who hpeo to be
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The richness of a convoluted plot, the sheer number of well &#34;documented&#34; characters, a most wonderfully rich and detailed world. One is kept spellbound through the last page and left craving for more.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I'm new to games older people need more time to learn and I love something that doesnt require speed and coordination this is more of a find and discover type of game wich I like clues mystery and discovery and a little horror effect thrown in...who doesn't love a creepy carnival
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Recently seen the movie, so i decided to give it a go.<br /><br />I read this book from start to finish in two days, and i am not a big reader. So you can say I was really interested.<br /><br />Jack Reacher is a different character than what I got from the movie, more depth, less inhuman wich i like.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|It really means that you don't have to worry at all about this movie being a disappointment. Disney did it again with this one. It has all the elements of an exciting film for the ENTIRE family.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I read the book and enjoyed it very much.  I wanted to see the movie and compare with the book.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|While I think this is an exciting series and I can understand the hype. My main reason for not liking this is because of the actual story. I just can't get past the killing amongst themselves. I understand the survival, but it reminds me of Lord of the Flies and I detested that book. I read it mostly to prepare for the movies.
0375869026|5.0|Wonder is the best book I've read all year.  And I've read A LOT.  A must read for all school kids in middle school. I would encourage all middle school teachers to include it in their curriculum.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Extremely easy to use. Works well even. Off line<br />I found adding new locations very easy and the fact t it stores the new location on a quick pull up list  very convenient.Caution when adding a new location you must 're.ember to put the Country of origin.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I downloaded when it was the Free App of the Day.  Never got around to trying it because I have been playing another Awesome FAOTH Block Story (Minecraft like game).  My 4 yr. old grand daughter came over and checked what I had new tried it ans soon was  flying through levels.  Graphics are great &amp; she loved the sounds as well.  She completed 20 levels before her Dad came back to pick her up and immediately asked him to get it on his phone.  She has also completed Flow Free and Flow Free Bridges both of which were FAOTD for the original Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Note about FAOTD I see a lot of complaints about certain ones and at the time they may be justified.  However I always take them and then save them to the cloud because usually the developers do improve them into decent Apps with hefty price tags.  I have games, utilities and lots of other free things that are now top rated high priced Apps because I did this.  Stream top Desktop I think its called was free and is one of the best Apps I ever got this way.  Something to consider.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is very fun. My sister thought that I was wasting my money, then I let her play and she bought it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I had this game when I had my ipod and loved it now I have it for my kindle and love it even more now that I can I see it better. its just a great game to destress with.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved this book because how it talks about Greek Mythology and how it talks about his life in a private school
B008XX6J4C|4.0|Music is edgier than I expected....not relaxing piano music, but good for doing physical work or exercising.  Not bad music, just not classical crossover type (3 Tenors, Canadian tenors, etc.)  More avant gar de than classical.
0425252868|5.0|This was a remarkable story revealing the power of the human spirit regardless of nationality, etc I especially enjoy stories from WWII.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm 13 days into the shred and I can definitely see a difference in my abs and arms! Recommend to all who hate hitting the gym
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I need to play this challenging game several more times before I can share my opinion with anyone else so be patient.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Whatever opinion you have of Steve Jobs is bound to change after reading this book.  The real story of a brilliant, but human (with many flaws) man.  A one-of-a-kind book about a one-of-a-kind person.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I think I am addicted to the solitaire game. I have been playing it several times a day and never find it boring. Thanks
B0042RJWTC|5.0|loved the series on shotime and glad to have gotten the complete set..fun to watch and if you like this period of history made ot fun to learn more about
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|This is a very poor excuse for what should be simple technology.  First the audio pass through stopped working, then the video stopped outputting 1080p and every other format except 1080i.  Save yourself some disappointment and get the PNY brand MDP to HDMI converter.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|love love love all the bird games but this one sis the most fun to play besides the rio game
B009E3EXMU|4.0|I got the deluxe edition 2cds and 2 DVDs. Both cds are good. The main movie, DVD l is awesome. DVD ll is a poor filler. I was hoping for way more for DVD ll. I was hoping for the band rehearsing for the show. What DVD ll entails is a complete warm up show from a static camera and not a very detailed one. DVD ll may make for a different listening experience but forget about the visual. That said the concert on DVD l is splendid, well filmed, great audio, a fine show. Jason does a remarkable job on drums.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Good to refer to to see how much life my kindle has & monitor charging. I like the breakdown of usage available
0765325950|5.0|Finally an ending to the series, and what a great book this was. Absolutly I recommend it. The only sad part is that there'll be no more books on the story<br />I don't write more because I don't want to ruin the surprises while reading it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|As I slowly upgrade my DVD collection to Blu-ray (a process I expect to finish right around the time Blu-ray's replacement becomes common), I caught this set on sale and snapped it up without a moment's hesitation. I already owned the 4-disc DVD collection that came out in 2001, and all things considered, I probably should have just stuck with that edition.<br /><br />That's not to say there's anything wrong with this collection. There isn't. It's as perfect as can be - not just the films themselves, but the transfer and the presentation as well. The extras are excellent, as well. Parts of the transfer are better than the older DVD edition. And strangely, that's the problem.<br /><br />Over the years, the original negatives for the first two films were essentially destroyed. A great effort at restoration has been made for this collection, and where it worked, the effect is stunning. In those scenes, the film looks like it was shot yesterday - perhaps not as sharp as one might expect, but the colors are vibrant and edges are much sharper than before, without losing that beautiful grain or the warmed tones so characteristic of these films.<br /><br />That's where the restoration worked. In some scenes, however, scans had to be taken from different prints, or so much reconstruction was necessary that the finished scene simply looks different from the ones before and after it. These interludes are brief and rare, but I found them difficult to ignore. Conversely, watching the DVD with upscaling in my BD player - even though that transfer was roundly criticized for being dark and somewhat murky - offers a much more uniform \\"look\\" throughout viewing, and with nearly the same level of sharpness. It's less distracting.<br /><br />If you don't already own a copy of this utter masterpiece, shame on you, buy this right now. If you don't think you'll be as annoyed by the visual inconsistency as I am, buy it. You'll rarely find treasure for so low a price. I certainly plan to keep my copy, and will in all likelihood part with the DVD (the Blu-ray has the distinct advantage of taking up half as much shelf space) but this is one of those rare times when I would have liked an \\"unrestored\\" option to be available. With only one film per disc, there certainly was enough room.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Do you like turtles or cheese or pie creme cheese FACEHUGGER ATTACK I like turtles and nerdy people and predator mostly alien vs predator movie lol
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading the beginning few chapters of this book (and without reading a summary of the book), i was very surprised at the turn the book took about halfway through.  The book was very well written and is set at a good pace.  I enjoyed it very much and could NOT put it down!  It was very different than I expected - in a good way.  The book is very emotional and tugs at your heart.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Really like the tracks, playing it a lot in my car when driving to and from work. TV show is great
B005HSG3TC|4.0|the case looks nice, light weight as it described, love the strip, hidden and work well. Only thing we have problem with is  it is bit on the soft side and hard to stand well. But overall a good product.
B001BZGA8Y|5.0|I recieved in great conditions and in tima my item. Thanks a lot . . . . . . . . . . .
B00B2V66VS|3.0|About half the time, when I hit 'Save Me' the game cuts off, I lose the diamond anyway, and the coins from that round do not save.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Ghost Protocol is part of the Mission Impossible movie series. I have all of the Mission Impossible movies. Having grown up with the TV show the movies are a must have for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just an amazing production, attention to details, costumes and overall portrait of that era is simply mesmerizing. Love watching this show, it doesn't disappoint in 3 seasons in a row!
B0062P332Y|5.0|I love movies. It is my escape. The Killer Elite is a great way to escape. In fact I will probably watch this movie again this week. The Blue Ray version is always my first choice. HD looks so good. It is hard to watch anything but.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's ok but sometimes the choices are too hard to draw and you have to buy bombs to get new choices
B008JGSM6G|5.0|What a great challenge.  I read all day long good to have this on the subway ride home to do. Great challenge.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this book. Well done Gillian Flynn! This was the first mystery I'd read in a while.
B00122Z9DS|4.0|If you're a fan, this is a good one.  If not, you're not going to like it.  It's far more typical 90's Rush-sounding than some of their recent work like Test for Echo or Clockwork Angels--a bit less heavy, a bit more melodic.
B009RH973I|5.0|Everything about this case has held up to my expectations! The Elastic still works perfect and standing part of the case works great which I was a little nervous about...I would definately buy this case again+
B00005QGAX|4.0|Being one of his biggest selling Albums, I had to get this one to when i ordered Dangerous, although i feel that Dangerous is the better album...  My opinion only of course.  Nothing this guy put out was bad ( pardon the pun).<br />I still miss him long after his death....RIP Michael! And you are the baddest.
