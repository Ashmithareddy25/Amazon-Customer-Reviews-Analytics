0439023513|3.0|Collins concludes the Hunger Games series with Mockingjay that sees the climax of the Districts' war on the Captitol and features Katniss, Peeta, Gale and others former Tributes as the key players in the battles that occur.  Mockingjay offers gripping action and developments and continues the elaboration of all the characters that make the series so intriguing.  The story includes some events that ring too fantastical to be consistent with the mainline plot. Readers will eagerly read through to the end in suspense to see how the story ends and how the characters live or die.  This book is adequate but not overly satisfying; however, it is definitely worth the read.
B000I0QM04|4.0|Retro fun here, not the single greatest movie ever made, but loads of character, style, action, and neo-noir fun! Bought it on DVD years ago and it looks even better on blu-ray now.
B009AMAK54|5.0|This is a combo exciting sports movie, family dynamics movie, and love story. Clint Eastwood is pitch perfect as an elderly \\"loveable curmudgeon\\" - and the story poses the question whether it's time for him to pack it in and retire, or bring his 50+ year career as a major league baseball scout to a marvelous pinnacle. The adorable Amy Adams plays his 33 year old daughter, seeking to reconcile \\"daddy's sort-of-absent love\\" with her own actual inner strength, and the fact that she is a perfect female, and younger, version (in all the good ways) of her tough, masterful, no-nonsense father. Justin Timberlake plays the intelligent, honest and gentle suitor for the daughter's affections- enhanced by the fact that her father (the Eastwood character) was his mentor as well, a few years back. Sure- all of this is stock-ish movie making characterzation- maybe even \\"predictable,\\" but so are most excellent things in life on one level. It is also alive and fresh, and thoroughly sweet and inspiring. I am not a baseball fan, but the sport and the game, while respectfully and thoroughly addressed in the movie, are secondary or even tertiary to the humanness of the characters. I found this to be a solid, enjoyable, and most worthy movie!
B009SJ3LHI|5.0|This show gets better with each new episode. Who knew that being alive in a courtroom was not enough to declare you undead. Oliver Quinn also had to relive his nightmare for a courtroom of strangers while his family looked on. The crook of the week decides to use China White to put down the Arrow and sent assassins to kill Laurel first, then her police chief dad. Lucky for Laurel, Quinn and Dig were there to save her. China White proves she can go toe to toe with Arrow, and another corrupted businessman is crossed of the Arrow's revenge list. As in the pilot episode, the mother meets with someone (who is off screen this time) to discuss her son. What do you wanna bet that was John Barrowman?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Some people review the movie, not the product.  I think you shouldn't buy a movie if you don't like it.  I love this movie and the books and of course the blu-ray is great!
B007MDB548|4.0|Got an early 2D Blu-ray (European) copy and watched it with my two kids (4 and 7), and they loved every minute of it. In fact, they've watched it 4 times within a week already :). For me, I find 'Great Fairy Rescue' to be the best in the series, 'Secret of the Wings' is a close 2nd, followed by the first, then 'Lost treasure'.<br /><br />The Blu-ray video quality is simply reference grade, with the DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio also very good. No banding in the video as you sometimes get in animations, with crisp picture and lots of detail as expected from a completely digital source. The extras included are on the skimpy side, with the main highlight being 'Pixie Hollow Games', the so-so short that aired on the Disney channel earlier this year.
B004JXXKWY|5.0|I've read a few of Michael Lewis's books and this one is just as good as the rest. He has a way of explaining complex financial subjects so that any reader can grasp what really happened in the financial meltdown of the late 2000's. The portrayal of the real life characters in this book keeps the reader entertained. Highly recommended!
0345803485|2.0|A friend gave me the paperback to read and pass along. I passed it along about two hours later. I thought the book started out interestingly enough but it went downhill quickly. I couldn't understand what he saw in her and then I couldn't understand what she saw in him. The latter became the more important thing, probably because I figured what he saw in her was an innocent girl that he could master. But what the heck did she in him? Other than the superficial, that is.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|The continuing story of Eva Tramell and Gideon Cross, love and passion, and a real lack of communication.<br /><br />The story plot was not as good as the first novel.  This one just didn't really hang together well, and the ending was not really believable, either.  No real resolution on why and how the deed was done.  No discussion between the lovers.<br />I find it almost unbelievable that two people could be so passionately in love and never really talk.  Can it really be so hot between them that physical communication is all they have?<br /><br />As the second one in a trilogy, this was not nearly as good as the first one, and hopefully, the third one will be much better.
0689105657|5.0|If you appreciate the Oriental culture, this is a must read! James Clavell has never disappointed. The book is great entertainment and you wont be able to put it down!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This book foreshadows an ending in which the reader will learn an important lesson about time but in actuality, there's no such ending and its disappointing. Also, none of the characters are likable giving more reason to not waste time reading it.

B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't care much for this story. It was too frustrating to read about innocent characters getting framed or hurt over and over, and the ending was absurd. I did not like the ending at all.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|I loved this book, loved the 1st book and I'm really looking forward to the next.  It couldn't come soon enough.
0765357151|4.0|More melancholy than scary, I felt this was more of a dystopia than a horror book. For that reason, it only gets a 3/5ths of a scream rating. Still, it does have vampires in it so it isn't a walk in the park or anything. (Yet the vampires are more dumb than scary for the most part.)<br /><br />THE BASIC STORY<br /><br />Robert Neville might be the last man on Earth. Everyone else is either dead or turned into a vampire by a virus. Neville seems to be immune to the virus, but he hasn't given up hope that he might find another like himself out there. Despite his intense loneliness, Neville dedicates himself to fighting the vampires (who come to his house nightly) and trying to figure out why this happened and whether it can be undone.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />The \\"last man left on Earth\\" story is a good one, and this was one of the better ones I've come across. I felt a real sympathy for Robert Neville, and my heart broke for him over and over. His practical nature and approach to the vampire problem felt realistic ... like something that might legitimately happen. He struggles and gives up and then gets reenergized and then falls apart again. I think I would react to this situation in a similar way--losing my faith and then finding it again only to wonder why I was continuing on against all odds.<br /><br />Matheson does a good job of providing the back story while keeping us firmly rooted in Neville's present. I got just enough glimpses of how he ended up in this situation to sympathize with him and understand the reality that he must endure. I loved how he took a scientific approach to the problem and experimented with all the various vampire lore that we've all heard about. More than anything, I think Matheson captures the difficulty of being completely alone in a world that has fallen apart around you. It would be so psychologically challenging. You completely understand why Neville woos a stray dog so diligently and carefully--humans aren't meant to live alone!<br /><br />The ending was very satisfying and true to the nature of the book. (And I love how the title gets incorporated into it.) It is definitely one of the more melancholy horror books I've ever read, and it left me feeling sad. If you're looking for an atypical vampire book or are a fan of dystopia, this would be an excellent choice. It is much more about Robert Neville's struggles and emotional life than anything else, and this elevates it from being \\"just a horror book.\\"e alone!<br /><br />The ending was very satisfying and true to the nature of the book.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|Fall of Gians had so many characters with whom I became attached, especially Walter, and couldn't wait to read about his romance and marriage with Fitz's sister in the next book (Winter of the World), ... I at least wanted Fitz to have his comeuppance in the next book.  I would have liked to have sen him face his sister or make contact with his sister but he just got off too easy in this book.  The first book made me hunger for the sequel.  Winter of the World, while just as informative with its history, does not make me hunger to read the next.  Perhaps because the first gave me a btter insight into how WWI  came about, as well as Russias revolution, and Winter of the World did not give me anything that I hadn't lived through.  Not sure what the next can tell me about life since WWII since I am 80 years old.

B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is slow at first, but if you use your coins, and close the game and let them regenerate, it goes okay.  Later, after you've gained prizes and upped the coin limit, it gets faster paced and you begin trying to earn everything!  (There are carnival games that you earn the prizes to over time.)  I am enjoying the game!
B003THN75G|5.0|The access was very quick pay and play.<br /><br />The replay was seamless and uninterrupted by buffering, and or slow internet traffic<br /><br />The quality was 1080p level<br /><br />Good cheap way to catch up on missed episodes of TV Dramas and test the waters to see if certain episodes are worth watching.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site. I have made several recipes and have gained a lot of great organization and diy ideas too
B007THA4FI|1.0|I find the book boring. It's like reading a soap opera. The plot is lame. After reading 70 percent I jumped to the ending because I couldn't take it anymore and of course the ending is a let down. Overall the entire book us one big let down.

0765316994|5.0|A 2 part review<br /><br />Non spoiler review:<br /><br />I enjoyed the book a great deal.  I found it both a light pleasant read and interesting on both an intellectual and emotional level.  I've read (some years ago) some of the author's other works, in many ways I like this one better.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn't like is the blurbs (on the back cover) I found them misleading.  I'll say why in the spoiler review.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Spoiler review:<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />-<br />The reason I didn't like the blurbs is that they stated that this was a super funny book (roughly quoted: \\"funniest I've ever read...\\").  It isn't.  It is somewhat funny in spots, but compared to say Dave Barry's Big Trouble, it is no-nonsense.<br /><br />BUT, that's ok, I don't think it is supposed to be a farce (despite the subject matter).<br /><br />What I read it as is a light hearted but \\"realistic\\" look at what it would be like to be stuck in a \\"fictional\\" universe.  I.e. when a fan thinks about living in their favorite book/movie/tv show what are they asking for?  Getting eaten by orks because you didn't think to put up a stockade (Hobbit)?  Being a really bad shots because you're the bad guys (Star Wars)?  Heck, not getting Hobbits to eat because Hobbiton is off limits for the most part.<br /><br />Pretty much the moral of the story is that the author (or show creator) owes it to the characters to use them properly.  In other word:  Do unto your characters as you would have your author do unto to you.<br /><br />It's a novel take on the concept.  Everybody talks about owing the readers a decent effort, or owing it to oneself as an artist, but this pushes the other side.<br /><br />Now, in some ways, I've seen it explored before, but not quite this directly or with quite the moral dimension for authors spelled out.  Heinlein's \\"Job\\" or \\"Number of the Beast\\" come to mind.<br /><br />Hmmmm, I sure didn'tthink I'd ever be saying this (even if \\"Job\\" is my least favorite RAH work) but I think this book did it better than Heinlein's \\"Job\\".  I am actually waiting for lightning to strike, \\"better than\\" and \\"Heinlein\\" are not words that belong in the same sentence.<br /><br />But, the message I took from \\"Job\\" is that you (character) are pretty much doomed by the author's whim, unless some other power (editor?) helps you out.  This book has the characters helping themselves, by using the bad writing against itself.  Much cheerier, though perhaps less realistic.  But if folks wanted realistic dismal fates there would be RussianNovelCon instead of Comicon.  And the SCA would be a major health hazard.  But I digress...<br /><br />I think one reason I like this book is that I've always hated bad \\"universe\\" writing:  The author says the universe is THIS way and then breaks that rule lazily.  Or all the smart characters ignore the (vastly obvious) solution until convenient.  It just bugs me...  I guess because I put myself in the things I read.  So this book is a counterattack, an anthem for us the downtrodden characters, so we may unite and demand better!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is a fun game/app. It will definitely make you think. The time trial will hook you in no time flat. Varying backgrounds will be a nice update.
030758660X|5.0|I had seen Vampire Knits at my local Michaels Arts and Crafts store several times when I went in and had always passed it over, despite giving it a quick once-over. When I went in to the store with the intention of seriously looking at the book and deciding if I wanted to buy it I was upset to find that it was no longer there. Well, 3 months later I returned and there it is, sitting happily on the shelf as though waiting for me! I flipped through the patterns and was pleasantly surprised to find that there were quite a few pieces in the book that I could see myself making and wearing. I'm a fan of 'classic' Vampire literature (Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire, Poppy Z Brite's fantastic novel Lost Souls, Annette Curtis Klause's The Silver Kiss-all of these have dog-eared pages on my bookshelf) so I expected to see lots of black, odd shaped bat-wing garments, fishnet and satin, that sort of thing. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw all the lace!<br /><br />I'm an intermediate knitter at best (my mother is well beyond advanced however) and I've already decided that my first project will be the lovely Shapeshifter Shrug, followed by the Sitio Stockings. Hopefully the book will be the 'push' I need to get me over my fear of knitting cables and buttonholes. The pieces are beautifully designed and the photographs are delicious and tasteful. Vampire Knits is definitely not for your hard-core goth fan, but it is for women who appreciate tasteful additions to their wardrobe. There's plenty of cutesy accessories like the Werewolf Hat and Torniquet Scarf, but also some very lovely elegant pieces like the Hooded Cowl and the Pulse Protectors Pair wrist and neckwarmer. I just wish I lived in a climate that was cold enough to wear them for at least 5 months! Can't wait to start knitting some of the things out of this lovely book!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Although the first few chapters read like a romance novel for sixteen year old girls, the erotic stuff is pretty hot.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Must read, can't put down. Hot, sexy and emotional. Gideon and Eva take you on their journey to heal and find peace and love in their messed up lives.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is a great book! A little too sinister for me, but the description is graphic. Makes you feel like you are there...
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I'm a huge comic book nut so I had to buy this movie as soon as possible. Loved it in theaters, loved it in the privacy of my own home. The director did a good job of keeping the characters true to form and the plot was a chip off the ol' block with Hulk attacking his allies to the Ultimate Avengers being attacked by something from space yet again. I also want to credit my seller, FVE. I received my product on time, brand spanking new and all for a great price.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Nicely written as always by dan brown. not as thrilling as da vinci or angels n demons. but still pretty good.
B005LAII8A|5.0|First off I have to say the studio press blurbs don't even hint<br />at the complexity of the story. I'll be thinking about this movie<br />in the next few days.<br /><br />Second, the makeup to turn Joe Gordon into a young Bruce Willis<br />is astonishing. This is Oscar-caliber work. Joe's mom was right,<br />they turned her son into a different man.<br /><br />Third, I think Looper is a morality play (a good thing) in the<br />same sense as Planet of the Apes (going back to the novel).<br />Looper's characters are driven so hard by their own damaged,<br />selfish individuality, the question becomes \\"Can any single one<br />of them, just once, step outside themselves?\\"<br /><br />One of the classic purposes of science fiction, going back to<br />H.G. Wells or earlier, is for the writer(s) to warn us about<br />something we may not yet have imagined. Looper is a very grim<br />warning of what may happen with the continued advance of<br />technology. Organized crime has existed for centuries or millenia,<br />and like all social organizations, it has its own interests in<br />the future and in technology.<br /><br />The larger vision of American and World society is wrapped up<br />in all this, and it is very bleak. These characters are outside<br />any stereotype of \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\", and \\"the good guys\\" are no<br />where to be found. With these characters all we can hope for is<br />that one of them will stop themself.<br /><br />Having said that, the broad critical opinion on Looper is correct,<br />this is a very good movie. But way, way not a feel-good movie, and<br />very definitely not for kids. If Hunger Games was maybe 80% dark,<br />and District 9 was 95% dark, Looper is more like 99% dark.<br /><br />Or perhaps I should say 99% drama.

I have not had any glitches with this. My grandma taught me to play solitaire 45 yrs ago and I know if she were still alive she would love to play this game.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Having already read several of Zoe Saadia's books, I have come to expect action, strong characters and interesting history. Yet again, Ms. Saadia hasn't disappointed with the first book in her new series. Two likeable, fallible, believable characters join together to weave a story that keeps you reading. Ms Saadia has the ability to bring her extensive historical knowledge of the the period into her stories of battle, political intrigue and love. Before you know it, you are walking down the ancient streets, fighting your way through crowded markets and gripping an obsidian sword! Keep writing because I want to keep reading!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always loved SK's books. Some are better than others, but his style of writing is so readable and he can make you believe anything. He just makes this world a better place to be when you're reading his books. Anything's possible. I loved 11/22/63.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The characters are developing very well and aging appropriately for their fan base to be able to relate to. I liked that this installment didn't end up packaged in a neat bow the way others have - turmoil abounds. The seven demigods are tested. I can't wait to see the next two books and find out how all the pieces come together...
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I can't understand why some reviewers want to just pick this movie apart! I watch movies to be entertained...not to be educated, and certainly not to be made to feel bad at the end of it. I already know that a hip replacement surgery is no piece of cake, and that many elderly people end up in nursing homes. I'd rather watch a movie that portrays a happy alternative than one that grinds home the more common reality.<br /><br />I saw the movie (twice!) in a theater, and then bought the DVD. I've watched it several times and still enjoy it. I've recommended it to many friends. I loved all the actors and their portrayals. Do I think I can move to India and live like this? No! Do I wish I could? Kind of...<br /><br />For those who think the story should be more realistic, I recommend you read the book that inspired the movie. \\"Inspired\\" is the key word here, because the book by Deborah Moggach is very different and much more complex. The book's tone and characterizations are much \\"grittier\\". There are quite a few more characters in the book, and the book's focus is not on Evelyn's or Graham's characters. I don't know if it is \\"more realistic\\", but if you don't like such a \\"sweet\\" story, you should like the book.

I was really happy that Katniss and Peeta finally got back together, and that she was finally able to tell him how she really felt about him.  And that it was nice that Katniss finally agreed to have children now that there were no more Hunger Games.
0062127241|4.0|what a tremendous book. in brief vignettes, Pete describes how he lived -- like it or not. The Who were consuming for him, too, just like you. He has huge admiration for Daltrey. He's (still) depressed, just like the teenagers for whom he wrote.<br /><br />Would I have liked him to focus more on songs, shows that meant something more to me? Sure, and I think Pete would say, write your own damn book.<br /><br />He ends the book: \\"This is as much a note to myself as one to you. It's all the same thing. If in doubt, just play.\\"<br /><br />I'm off to play.  Support your local library!<br /><br />Tom Sakell l harborsights.com
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!  Destined to be one of the few favorites that I read at least once per year.  I LOVE this book.  I geeked out at each pop culture reference.  So well written and well developed, I had trouble putting it down.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great graphics and plot. I have to play everyday because the next level gives more energy to play longer. Fun game
0316228532|5.0|I found The Casual Vacancy to be absorbing, engaging, often darkly humorous, and ultimately heartbreaking. The many characters were well drawn . It didn't take long to learn who was who even though the relationships were complex. Highly Recommened.

B002PJN59M|5.0|I use this video ( Excaliber) to teach King Arthur to my Special Education seniors. It works well when frontloading visuals for students that don't visualize. When they read the text they have something to help with reading comprehension. I often buy videos from Amazon.com for literature in my classroom.

B0083Z614S|5.0|Well written with a moral of kindness. I've read a dozen times and yet I never get tired of it.
0525958002|5.0|From a man in a band that once claimed to be \\"deeply superficial\\", Taylor's book is a very warm, compelling memior filled with touching sentiment for his family, his bandmates and his fans.  Taylor writes with the conversational tone of a confident or friend, but with occasional dramatics that are well timed.  The sections are short, quick moving and told with brutal honesty and humor.  While a great deal of the rise-fall-rise story we have heard before, I don't think I have ever heard it with such humility without being apologist.  John is someone that we would like whether he was famous or not...a great read!
0316228532|1.0|Such a disappointment. Knowing what a skilled writer JKR is and her amazing creativity I purchased this book with high expectations. What a let down. I found the characters to be dull and no one was likable so I didn't really care about them or their situations which were not very interesting anyway. The first fifty or so pages were just introducing the characters. I tried to read it to the end thinking it would improve as we went along but it didn't seem to be heading in that direction so I gave up. There are plenty of good books to read; why waste my time.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is really fun awesome for road trips......or reagular trips.I have so much fun trying to beat all of the games. the wishing game is the best.<br />I cant wait to win.

B0076L9W9Q|5.0|I saw Halestorm when they performed on main stage at Rock on the Range 2012 ([...]).<br /><br />I was blown away by what I heard and saw. The lead singer is fantastic, with such a presense on stage! It was awesome hearing her! The guitarist and bassist were energetic, always a plus and the drummer was insanely good. X3 Loved their sound so much! And just now I finally got the cd! I am insanely glad I did, it's playing nonstop in my car right now.<br /><br />Mz Hyde is my favorite song and how it segways into Misery blew my mind and gave me goosebumps. This band plays rock with such enthusiasm and you can feel it! I simply can't say enough. All the songs are playable over and over. Even the slow songs, of which I usually am not a giant fan of.<br /><br />I highly recommend this cd for those who want to hear good, GOOD rock.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this love story, can't wait for the next one!  Much more well written then 50 shades (don't get me wrong I enjoyed 50 Shades too, but...) this one is a bit more believable and the author does an amazing job pulling you into the story as if you are there and feel all the emotions.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who is looking for something new to read after 50 Shades.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was fantastic! I read it in only three days!!  I can not wait for the third book in december!
B008673ZAQ|2.0|This series is a total ripoff. Characters have no depth. Yeah the author is a more seasoned writer than E.L James but it seems like Sylvia Day just copies ideas from 50 Shades of Grey and had a field day.  I kept reading just to see how much more of a train wreck it really is. I Will Not be reading the last book.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love nanograms! I've bought a lot and got a lot for free and this is one of my favorites. It's also easy to use on a phone. I'm not crazy that you have to double click on a square to x it and I would like to be able to slide the color across several squares instead of tapping each one so I took a stat for that, but other than that it's fantastic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is HOT! After nearly breaking my wrist from fanning myself, I practically raped my husband, smoked a cigarette (I don‘t smoke!?) and came here to write this review.<br />I‘m not one to give away any spoilers so aside from saying this is one of the most interesting books I‘ve ever read and replacing my undies, there‘s not much left to do. Definitely worth the price, maybe more! Gideon and Eva are as f*#%-d up as ever and it makes for a great read!<br />P.S. Ms. Day, marry me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Keeps you intrigued! good read! cant wait to read the 2nd book! then the third of course!!! lol :-)  b
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Kay scarpetta is an ingenious character and always has a great story to tell. Cornwell  always keeps you on the edge of your seat.
0451209338|4.0|Excellent Read!  The usual \\"twist\\" that make's DeSilva a special author!  I always enjoy the \\"Gabriel\\" escapades.  My only wish is that there would be another one right now!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|wonderful graphics and addicting game play<br />the level starts out easy and gradually gets more challenging.<br />nice little game. I'm really pleased that it was available for free!
B00594XOZU|5.0|My daughter loves it because she can't always pick up wireless when we're out, except now she uses my phone all of the time!
B009CPEJCO|1.0|What is this crap I invest in purchasing from Amazon the first 2 seasons of the mentalist only to turn the page and find out you are withholding the last episode of season three \\"Strawberries and Cream\\".<br /><br />I never expected that. Amazon is not meeting customers expectations by doing this there should be a disclaimer before you start purchasing full seasons as to which episodes are not available.<br /><br />I will not continue purchasing episodes, because like many others I don't like to skip any in a series especially one episode as important as this one.<br /><br />Place this two parter as a movie and charge more, I will purchase it, that is quite fine with me then I can continue to patronize this series otherwise, forget it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Yahoo this game is better than mama's gravy and biscuits boy howdy yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yessssssssssss sir eeeeeeee
B001DJLCPO|5.0|We think this is one of the most interesting and captivating movies available today. It's visually stunning with a wonderful story and fine acting. The young lady who plays the lead is especially striking. We already had the DVD but the blu-ray makes it even more enjoyable. We'll read and/or watch pretty much anything Neil Gaiman is involved in and this was another delightful surprise. We strongly recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a really fun and addicting game and the price can't be beat. I was hooked from the start.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app works just like the web site! highly recommend for all pintrest lover's and those about to join the addiction.
0316228532|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The darker side of human nature is often disturbing and not easy to write about. These characters are real - they mirror many a family and acquaintances. Don't make the mistake of comparing this book to children's book. Compare it to Dostoevsky, or Dickens or any of today's popular authors like Deaver, Kellerman, Childs, Sandford, Grafton, Crais, etc. - Then you see how JK towers above them.<br /><br />Don't expect a \\"Happy\\" book. Expect a slice of life on the earthy side, and you'll be as pleased with the book as I am.
034580404X|5.0|These books were the best bools i have ever read. I would recommend them to anyone who wants to spice up their relationship in the bedroom. And also to the people that are trying to get pregnant!!! It will make you want to make babies for sure.
B0010XTHLO|4.0|The Tudors is brilliant! The music is fantastic and the acting is tops. It doesn't quite follow the exact history, but since watching this show I've researched King Henry VIII and learned a lot. I wish it hadn't ended.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This newest installment is great as per the standard! I love this entire series! Rick will not let you down in this one! It is about time the girl becomes the hero!
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a great app must hqve pinterest is awesome. 5/5 10/10 epic. if you are looking for a great app with lots of funny, cute, andinspiring photos get pinterest an d go online too.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|The movies are great but the first movie was not included. Should have been advertised that it wasn't complete. Series is awesome in BluRay and looks terrific. Overall satisfaction with purchase.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun puzzle game for everyone, especially if you are a fan of the Phineas and Ferb show on the Disney channel.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Enjoyed the first book but this one wasn't as captivating. Nonetheless, it was well written. Too similar to the 50 Shates trilogy. I read these series to capture the psychological analyses. What motivated these characters to behave the way they did? A good read if u haven't read this genre before.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is so gripping, edge of your seat drama, it's difficult to not watch the entire series in one sitting. The acting is superb.  It is very eye opening to see how the terrorist organizations and the CIA work. Brilliant TV. Can't wait for season 2 to be relaesed.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book had a lotttttt of similarities with fifty shades, but at the same time, there were a lot of differences. Over all, i loved this book, just wished that the book didn't end so hastily.
B00846REIS|4.0|A lot like Fifty Shades... but still really good! I cant wait to read the next book. It was a page turner!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Smooth interface, simplistic gameplay, no timer, adjustable difficultly, no over abundant ad prescience. Over all great app, good puzzle concept, great execution.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|It was the latest, new cover for the game and i got it right when it was supposed to arrive, the earliest day possible. No trouble at all, thanks!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first started playing, the game seemed to be too easy.  But, after getting through the first few rounds, I soon discovered this game to be intriguing and addicting. It is a great game.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This app was exactly what it claimed to be...it had a nominal storyline but absolutely lovely graphics.  It had enough challenges to keep it interesting and the power ups kept it from becoming ridiculously difficult.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|all the combinations of different sounds lets you get the exact mood you need.  great variety so you can relax NOT be bored.  two thumbs up!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Love this movie, i had no interuptions and it was clear view. I think im letting netflix go and start using this site better. Cant wait for the next movie.
B008NW67E0|4.0|I loved Mumford and sons last album, and this one doesn't disappoint. The only reason I am giving four Stars is because Babel sounds so much like sigh no more.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next album!!!
B000FBFN1U|5.0|An absolute must read, everytime you think you know what is coming Martin knocks you back and your left wanting more.  Great characters, vivid settings and a wonderful (and occasionally gut wrenching) story.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Excellent app!  Completely customizable.  You can set the time, the length of snooze, the tone, and the volume.  Love it.....<br />Vitad
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I love this show and the blu ray makes it that much better! I recommend this box set for any BSG fan. You really see its true colors.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|That about says it!  Wish I could view my wishlist through this app, but since I can't at least I can buy stuff with one click! That has really aided me in going further into debt!  Woot-woot!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely wonderful!  Can't wait for the next one!  definitely get the updates so help with the spelling and grammatical errors.  Everything else was absolute bliss!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been enthralled by this series since day one and it just gets better and better. this is a must read book for all ages
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Beginning of book seemed tedious at times with too many character names to keep track of, but plot climax was riveting with good lesson for us all. Great last line.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved the book. Although the ending was a bit over the top, I must admit, I enjoyed it. I was quite sad when I finished the book.
0307352145|2.0|Although the author states that there is a difference between introversion and shyness, she spends the majority of the book confusing the two herself. It seems that since she is both shy and an introvert, she has difficulty distinguishing between the two herself.<br />While the author makes some valid points it should be noted that her profession is law, not psychology and many of her assumptions and conclusions are based on subjects who are both introverted and shy, such as herself.<br />As a individual who is an extreme introvert but not shy I found the book missed the mark at several points; however, I do recognize that my combination of extreme introversion without being shy is rare and that the majority of introverts will identify with the examples in this book. I think it is important to recognize and be able to identify the difference between introversion and shyness. This book, in many ways adds blurs to the already hazy line between intoverted and shy.<br /><br />As I understand many reading this review will not yet understand the difference between introvert and shy, the best example I can give is myself. I refer to myself as an extreme introvert; I need to be alone to recharge and have even stated on many occasions in the past that \\"I hate people;\\" however, I do not have, nor have I ever had any issue with public speaking, in fact, I rather enjoy it. I now know that I do not hate people, rather I simply need time alone.<br /><br />For those of you who are both shy and introverted, this book will more than likely give you a deeper understanding of yourself. If you are an extrovert, this book will furthur your misunderstanding of introverts as a whole
B000Q6GUW0|2.0|I bought Dexter based on the good reviews and on the DVD I ordered from Amazon, the picture is barely watchable.  The picture is blurry and completely lacking in sharpness you would expect from a DVD.  I cannot watch past the first episode due to the poor quality of the DVD transfer.  I would not recommend this DVD based on the picture quality.
0307749584|5.0|I have read all of Lee Child's books and they are great. Bought this on cd to listen while on long trip. Great story and will keep your attention, never wanted to stop cd and take a break. Could use improvement in reading when going from male to female voice change. But still good enough to keep your interest. Highly recommend.
B000000WF0|4.0|The entrancing, driving hit \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" is just the tip of the iceberg of a really great album.  A uniform, cohesive sound with alt-country shadings and Ashcroft's shimmery, wavy voice over an acoustic mellow alternative vibe makes for an easy listen; lay back into a deep chair, grab your favorite cold drink, unbutton your shirt a bit, and enjoy.  Not a bad song on the CD.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|good app for free. addictive game play. I could do without the cheesy music and storyline from an elementary history class.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is great. I just didn't want to stop reading. I would be sitting in bed at 12:00 reading it. I had no problems with the book or anything. I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who has read the books before this one.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This is a great game to play. A lot of fun. Puzzles similar but still fun. A great time killer.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the variety! I have the motorolla droid, and this app is so easy to use and user friendly! I use it all the time
B005QVUZIU|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  I love the Spanish influence, very enjoyable and I listen to it all the time while driving.  Glad I bought it!
1878424114|5.0|My whole family read it. Its a very practical book. Easy to put into practice. Written in  a very simple straight forward language. If people put its principles in practice our world could be a much better place to live in.
B000WDQOLY|5.0|Being a marathon runner myself, I really enjoyed this episode. The story line and flashbacks just make this episode so different from all the other ones. This has to be one of my favorite episodes!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES File explorer is a very user friendly app. It is also a very useful tool whenever i want to delete some old and useless files. Easy to look for your files if you want to move some files from one directory to another.
B000TDGGRY|4.0|It was very good and I couldn't put it down.  I can't seem to stop reading when it's time to go to bed, I have to get up at 5AM each day, staying up till 2 or 3 is not good.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|very addictive for me.  love the effects it has.  like how its more then just a swapping game too. great app build n look forward to future apps from the company
B002MQYOFW|5.0|From the first chapter this books grips you and does not let go. Just yesterday I watched the film, which is quite good but of course there is no room for the first person narrative and extensive thoughts of the heroine. Unlike the second and third book, here you have a new world unfolding before you so there is a lot to take in and imagine.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft! In my opinion I like minecraft 20 x better than blockstory. Block story is not fun. Minecraft is addicting fun and the best app for kindle fire app ever!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book starts really slowly after the hunger games but as you go along there are surprises that you do not anticipate. I do not want to spoil the fun but if you enjoyed the first book then it is worth reading this one so that you get to the third and final one that is all the money.
1451662432|5.0|great book... you cant get a better hard workin guy... a true usa guy... I NEVER LIKE WHAT HE DID TO TRUCKERS!~
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|When I download something from outside source I couldn't highlight, underline, or put notes if I opened it up through Kindle or Aldiko.  Downloaded the Adobe Reader and it does all that!
B008X8QCTO|2.0|The 500MB download took a while, and the 'Bonus Chapter' issue came up *in the middle of solving a puzzle* less than halfway through the game. THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTINUE WITHOUT BUYING THE \\"BONUS CHAPTER.\\"<br /><br />The way Alawar handled this left a bad taste in my mouth. [Taxi driver: \\"Oh, you thought the fare covered taking you all the way home? Sorry, but you'll have to pay again or get out now.\\"]<br /><br />Reading the reviews, I'm very suspicious of the 5 and 4 star reviews on 9/28-10/4 that appeared after a few 1 star 'Bait and Switch' reviews. The theme is 'So, the developer lied about the price, and it crashed/froze/was too small to read, but you should expect this and it's worth it so quit whinning about the price to the developer.' Sorry, no.<br /><br />On the plus side, the game is entertaining, the graphics are very good, and the puzzles are creative.<br /><br />It will be a while before I buy another Alawar game.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|I never get tired of watching this movie, so happy I finally got it on DVD. Eastwood, Cleef and Wallach were superb. I love how the film subliminally tells you how The Civil War was a huge mistake. I also love the music by Enrico Morricone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was all sadness sex passion anger all emotions into  one I truly love Sylvia days writing and her story got Gideon
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I cannot wait to start on the next book! I am super excited & downloading it as I type!! lol!
B005LAIHR2|2.0|I dont mind musicals...if they are done right...but some of the numbers here were<br />very painfull to watch. Not everybody likes stuff like Glee. But take away the<br />crap then you have a bit of good stuff to watch for...
0385528752|5.0|I thought it was just another \\"you can do it!\\" self-help book, but it is so different. With many practical and easy-to-use tips and examples, the book provides guides like GPS: drive 2.5 miles and turn right. Good writing and organization too. One of the best in its kind.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|How many good alien/space/monster movies are out there.....a lot...and lots of them<br />are thumbs down.... At least this movie is interesting...well directed and if you<br />dont disect it and cry about everthing illogical you should be able to enjoy it.<br />You have spaceships...alien ships...aliens....good production values.<br />  So ...dont think too much and enjoy a good movie.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of supernatural. This season was in my opinion a lot better then the season previous. It goes back to hunting the monsters like they used to in the beginning. This said the last episode was a disappointment to me! Very predictable! I'm curious to see what they will do with the eighth season.
B00062PN6I|5.0|These Headphones are the best they are really comfortable and the sound is outstanding i will definitely recommend these to every one it fits to my phone so i get to listen to my playlist one thing i wish is that the cord would be a little shorter other than that there a great buy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a wonderful book!! Your child will love the series. Riordan ties Greek mythology into these books perfectly!!! Love it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love it. It is so easy to use. It helps me to keep moving throughout the day; to remember various tasks. Sometimes I use one sound - and sometimes a more annoying sound to make sure that it works. It is so easy
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|My wife and I both absolutely love this game! Very fun and would recommend it. One of the best they have had as faotd in my opinion.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this is the one of two games I love to play when I take my kids to chuck e cheese. I thought it would be really boring on my kindle but I love it .... just wish u could get more coins than 45 and more than 1 every 30 seconds while playing when u run out :(...... still a good time passer!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|The delivery of WH was efficient as it went directly to my kindle.  The book grabbed my attention immediately and was an easy read.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book weaves an historically -based tale of intertwining characters.  It is both entertaining and educational.  The writing style paints vivid pictures of the times and events of a world caught up in chaos.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Another excellent album from Mumford & Sons. The melodic line is slightly changed comparing with first album, but still the same powerful and profound melody and nice lyrics. To enjoy you have to listen...
B005EGXTHG|3.0|Was an entertaining read, and couldn't put it down which was fun. I found the style elementary and the plot to be too much of a repeat of the first book. I was never really totally encapsulated into the world of Panem, the entire time it still felt like I was reading a book. Still, a worthwhile read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am very satisfied with this app.<br /><br />I use it for several different alarms and the stopwatch.
B005EGXTL2|3.0|Book was enjoyable to read and difficult to put down, but I found the plot a little unbelievable and many parts were unnecessary. It did keep me guessing which was good, and there were a few twists which was good. Still felt like I was reading the whole time rather than being transported into the world of the characters. I found the writing awkward at times. Still enjoyable to read, and the ending was well suited.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|First up, I rate this somewhere between 3.5 - 3.9, but Amazon doesnt have that, so its 4 stars lol. I'm splitting this review in two sections. Of course spoilers follow :)<br /><br />1) Action - Well everyone knows that a RR book normally has snippets of action scenes during the course of the book, and then one or two major ones coming to the end, and the MoA was no exception. But I didnt like the twin giants fight, I felt it couldve been better. I mean, it was Percy and Jason, for Pete's sake. A lot of water and lightning couldve been involved, and there was a bit of that, but not as much as I expected. Look how well they combined their storm powers to fight the Romans at the Fort....Sumter, was it? It almost seemed as if RR focussed on the snippets of action scenes throughtout, and not the major action scene.<br />But I must say, some of those small action scenes were really good though, especially the whole Roman attack leading to the Fort, and Jason vs. Percy eidolon style lol I liked how Piper got rid of them. Maybe I was expecting too much for the twins fight, but thats just me, cause I like action scenes :) and I know in future books RR will have amazing action scenes, so Im not worried.<br /><br />2) Characters - Of course reading from Annabeth's POV was really great and insightful. And Leo.....I never realised how much I liked his POV until this book, he is really the ultimate comic relief in this series, with the exception of Coach Hedge lol Percy was good as always, although I found that he didnt really say much crazy and funny stuff like before, maybe Leo was stealing his humour lol Piper......I found that a lot of reviews bash Piper, which I dont like. Yes, she does obsess over Jason sometimes, but come on, she's a teenage girl in her first relationship, plus, who's her godly parent? Oh yeah, the Goddess of LOVE! I dont get it, do people want her to constantly worry about the quest or something? If she barely thought about him, Im sure people mightve thought that she didnt care about him. Let the girl indulge! Aphrodite herself said that a girl has to indulge.....I think that Piper is really growing, dealing with her insecurities about herself and her relationship with Jason. Look at Sadie in the Kane Chronicles, she was obsessing over TWO boys, but without her POV, that series wouldve lacked a lot of humour and wit. And kudos to RR for creating a character like Piper, to turn love and beauty into a power and the whole charmspeak thing, genius!<br />My only concern with the characters was that they got along a little too well with each other. Sure they had some minor disagreements, but they were either easily dealt with or just brushed aside. A little more tension was needed, however, I do like how they interacted at times and some of the discussions they all had together.<br /><br />Great book overall, those were my only two concerns, but of course you will enjoy this book so go forth and enjoy! And dont stress too much while waiting for The House of Hades! lol
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Okay, Beautiful Disaster by Jaime McGuire has received a lot of mixed reviews -- and from BOTH spectrums. This is a YA novel, based in a college setting about a girl, Abby Abernathy, who has left her hometown and everything bad about it and started over with her best friend, America Mason. Abby works hard to leave her old life behind and start anew. Abby's \\"new\\" life is turned upside when she attends an underground fight and meets the infamous Travis \\"Mad Dog\\" Maddox. Immediately upon seeing Abby in her bloodied cashmere top (thanks to flying blood from an elbow to his opponent's face), Travis nicknames her \\"Pidgeon\\" and is intrigued with their encounter. A few days later Travis learns that the girl he nicknamed \\"Pidgeon\\" is his cousin's/roommates girlfriend's best friend. (Say that 10 times!) Travis is intrigued with the girl who shows absolutely no interest in his boyish charms and rakish ways. Abby is appalled by Travis' treatment of the female student body. He beds them, refuses to take their phone number, and moves on to the next one. Abby is determined to not become \\"one of those\\" girls.<br />Abby loses a bet to Travis and ends up having to stay with him for 30 days. She risked this with the hopes that if she'd won he'd have to abstain from sex for 30 days. Regardless of his whorish ways, Abby enjoys Travis' company and they develop a fast friendship. The entire student body is stunned and confused as to their relationship. Travis never befriends any females but he's seen everywhere with Abby. Abby and Travis go through EXTREME ups and downs trying to determine if a relationship that is more than just friendly is worth it in the end.<br />Abby and Travis go through internal and external trials and tribulations. Even though, as a reader, you sometimes want to yell at one of them... all of them... you keep reading hoping someone gets their stuff straight. A lot of people have griped about Travis and how aggressive he is. Honestly he is a very REAL example of an alpha male. He's sexy, aggressive, intelligent, and emotionally driven. He's imperfect and yet you root for him the whole way. Abby has a haunted past that drives many of her decisions and mistakes. You empathize with her and struggle about which way she should go. I love America as the loyal best friend.<br />There are parts of the book where you cry, where you laugh, and where you wonder -- \\"what the hell is the matter with them??\\" Relationships are not cookie cutter style. Some are really shitty. Some are for life. This book is a great depiction of what can become of a BEAUTIFUL DISASTER.... Is it possible to walk through hell and still have a happily ever after?alpha male. He's sexy, aggressive, intelligent, and emotionally driven. He's imperfect and yet you root for him the whole way.

B003ITZBVS|5.0|When I sat down to watch this movie, I decided not to expect too much, and not expecting it to follow the comic very well! Well, this blew me away!!<br /><br />Not only did I feel this movie did a great job of picking the key elements from the comic story and making them work in the movie, they even had some parts where the dialogue was directly from the comic!! I was in heaven!!<br /><br />The casting in this movie was spectacular for the most part! Jensen did a tremendous job voicing Jason Todd and Neil Patrick Harris most certainly owns Night wing as far as I'm concerned!!<br /><br />I am a big fan of Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, so its hard picturing anyone else doing their voices. Batman's voice never did quite grow on me and I still wish Kevin Conroy had done it, but John Dimaggio's Joker certainly did! From the first maniacal laugh on, he had me! I still always love Mark Hamill the most, but I was really impressed with John Dimaggio as well!!<br /><br />The animation was also perfect!! It suited the tone of the story!! I really have nothing bad to say about this movie. Since buying it a few months ago I have watched it probably at least 50 times!<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Batman movies. Period. This is just a phenomenal movie. :)
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Could not put this down awesome comic wish it could have been color but other than that awesome, now to buy vol 2
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Gran pelicula una de las mejores peliculas de alien que he visto.<br />y el final una joya y muy entretenida la de principio a fin.
B008Y7Y0AM|4.0|been following this band since their seminal debut in 1992. I consider their first 4 albums masterpieces and subsequent albums very strong; this band never disappoints. Like most of their output, this album is not instantly accessible but after repeated listens it reveals its rewards. Most notable on A Map is that Aaron has put much more time into his  lyricism and vocal theatrics. Musically, this falls in line with Songs of Darkness Words of Light with hints of earlier albums. It's amazing that this band can make each album sound more depressing than its predecessor while still sounding fresh and unique. This won't be remembered as MDB's best album but it is a perfect display of them having honed their craft. Another deathless king to add to their exceptional line.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Pines takes on an amazing journey through a small mestisterios erious town. Pines is an amazing book action filled and suspenseful the whole,way through this is a must read for sure.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I've had these for about a week now and these are just the best headphones I've ever used, hands down.<br /><br />Have I used a lot? No.<br /><br />I've used a couple of different pairs of  Sony's (MDR-V150 for probably the past... 8 years?) another pair I can't remember the model number of, the ubiquitous iOS \\"white\\" earbuds, and some Sony behind the head headphones. I've used all of them for the same tasks... maybe with the exception of the V150s... and that is editing/listening to music/working out/and listening to audio interviews.<br /><br />Clearly, the earbuds were the most uncomfortable, a 3 on a 1-10 scale with 10 as the best. The behind the head, headphones are OK, but after awhile, they hurt too. The sound isn't incredibly accurate out of those either, but they have a nice shorter cord and fit in my gear bag excellently probably a 7 out of ten for overall use, comfort and dependability. The V150s are somewhat comfortable, like a 6? or 7? out of 10, but  they've got a super long straight cord that makes working out in them totally dangerous and I never used them for that. For other uses they're... OK.<br /><br />THESE, the 7506s answer the need for great 'cans' for editing, great for field monitoring and even just for kicking back and relaxing listening to music!<br /><br />I'm considering getting another pair or two to keep stashed away in case they ever break. These have replaced my behind the head, headphones for field monitoring (and another sony pair that I borrowed from someone similar in style to this but nowhere near as nice. Not sure on model nomenclature.)<br /><br />They've replaced anything else for editing other than speakers when I'm at home in my office.<br /><br />Buy these 'cans'! Do it! Do it now!

1401216676|5.0|That is what the Joker believes. That all it takes to go completely insane is one bad day. And the Joker is out to prove it by hurting those who Batman cares about the m<br /><br />It may not be the greatest Batman story ever told (what else can surpass KNIGHTFALL or THE LONG HALLOWEEN), but it is without a doubt, the greatest Joker story ever told! Alan Moore may hate it, but he truly knows what makes the clown prince of crime who he is, and just how sick and twisted his mind is. He builds up on the old 1951, &#34;The Man Behind the Red Hood&#34; story, and turns it into a tragedy. The man who would soon become the Joker was once a failed comedian, and a broken family man who is unable to support his pregnant wife. Desperate for money, he dons the garb of the Red Hood and leads a raid on the chemical plant he once worked at. The plan ends in disaster as the police and the dark knight arrive to stop the burglary. Terrified the man leaps into the river that is contaminated with chemicals from the plant. When he takes off the hood he is horrified to learn that his skin has been bleached bone white, his hair bright green, and his lips blood red. The trauma from tragic events of that day, as well as his grotesque appearance, destroys all sanity left inside of him. He then bursts out laughing like a maniac. On that Day, the Joker was born.<br /><br />In the Present, the Joker has once again escaped from Arkham, and has shot Barbra Gordon in the spine, permanently paralyzing her, and ending her career as Batgirl. He has committed this sick crime to try and drive her father, Commissioner Gordon, completely insane. Moore gives us a great mind twisting, and psychologically innovating story that gives us questions that we have never thought of. What truly causes one to go insane? Can one bad day really be all it takes? And how is Batman any different from the criminals that he fights? Is he really a sane man trying to bring justice to Gotham, or just another one of the crazy people? These are ideas that were never thought of until THE KILLING JOKE. The story also not only gives way to Barbra's transformation into Oracle (who I personally think is a better role for her than Batgirl), but her paralysis, along with Jason Todd's death (A DEATH IN THE FAMILY) makes Batman's obsession with Joker even more personal.<br /><br />Brian Bolland's artwork of the book is also superior. Bolland's recoloring of the book is even better than the original 1988 coloring. It truly reflects off Moore's deep storytelling and gives us a horrifying image of The Joker's origins (he takes all the color out of scenes from the past and leaves it only in objects like the Red Hood garb, The Joker's green hair, red lips, and yellow eyes) and of his attempts to drive Gordon insane. Combine both Alan Moore's psychologically terrifying storytelling, along with Brian Bolland's realistic artwork and you get a true masterpiece: BATMAN: THE KILLING JOKE!<br /><br />HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!eas that were never thought of until THE KILLING JOKE.

B0083SBM7Q|5.0|By now, unless you live in a cave on some remote Island you know The Avengers is an outstanding movie. What also really impressed me was the quality of the blue ray dvd and the wonderful menus and special features included on these discs. Every so often, some form of entertainment, whether it be a concert, a play, or a movie transcends itself beyond good into a another category of memorable.  It's almost like you'll be able to ask people in the future, where were you when you saw the first Avengers?

1475143389|4.0|I'm new to lifting, at least as far as a structured schedule is concerned. I found Mike's book extremely informative for someone who is new to the whole \\"game.\\" I used to be part of the school of thought that low weight and high reps will help tone individual body parts or that doing 100 crunches a day will build washboard abs and destroy belly fat. Mike snuffs out these and other common misconceptions rained down upon us by the fitness industry and completely annihilates all those \\"pumped up ads\\" in the steroid laden muscle magazines.<br /><br />There are portions of the book that can be a bit confusing, which took a few read-overs to understand, but I got the point (i.e. what time of day to eat carbs, and what to eat when cutting/bulking/maintaining). I can imagine that it's pretty hard to write a book on a subject where SO MANY variables rely on one another, so as a reader I made sure to have some patience.<br /><br />Mike is very easy to reach via email and will respond very quickly with advice and information. It's almost like having your own personal trainer \\"pen pal.\\"<br /><br />Granted, I am only in my beginner stages of lifting, so others who are more advanced and exposed to weightlifting might not find this book as valuable but I definitely did. I needed a kick start in my health regime and this is definitely going to help me build a baseline for my own \\"Year One Challenge\\" that Mike makes available to you at the end of the book.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to pack on the muscle and shred the fat off their body. Even if you have \\"heard it all before\\" it brings a lot of information together in one place so you can analyze it on a different level.<br /><br />Well done Mr. Matthews, I look forward to writing you with updated pictures and my completed success story!!
B002SSUQFG|2.0|I received this for Christmas last year.  Originally it lost about 5 minutes a day.  Mid summer the watchband broke and the watch fell about 12 feet to the ground. Since then the watch gains anywhere from 15 -30 minutes in a day.  When the watch arrived I tried to register it but the paperwork that came with the watch did not have the necessary information to register the warranty.  The watch looks good but I have to reset it daily.  Lookig at the other reviews this watch has a history of losing time.  I would not suggest buying this watch

B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book started off right where the first one left off... I actually found myself reading the end of the first book to get reacquainted when I first started.  You get to some of Gideon's \\"issues\\" so it's worth reading just to find out.  Not quite as HOT as the first one, but still steamy.  This one leaves off a little abruptly but that could be strategic for readers to pine for the last one in this trilogy.  All in all if you enjoyed the first book you will like this one.

B009KHDT0C|3.0|While not a complete waste of time this is definitely not Dark Shadows as I knew it. In general I like most thing from Tim Burton however this was not up to the usual standards I expect. I guess everybody has a clinker once in awhile. I've rated it at 3 stars as there are some funny parts and the film is not flat out terrible. I wish I had waited for it to have been available on Redbox as it is not worth $3.99 to me but would be reasonable for a buck and change.

0446580848|5.0|Once again Nelson DeMille has delivered a fast moving story with his new novel \\"The Panther.\\"  With 640 pages there is not a moment when the reader will want to put this book down.  This time DeMille returns with John Corey and Kate Mayfield who as members of the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City are given an assignment in Yemen to help capture the \\"Panther.\\"  The \\"Panther\\" is an American born terrorist who they believe is responsible for the bombing of the USS Cole and the killing of numerous others.  The plot is timely placed with Yemen making the news this week (Oct 18, 2012) where a drone strike near Jarr, a city in southern Yemeni ( a key placed in the novel), killed seven Al-Qaeda suspects along with a local Al-Qaeda leader.<br /><br />Arriving in Yemen, John and Kate are partnered with members of the CIA, State Department, and ex-military to form an A-Team to hunt down the terrorist known as the Panther.  As the plot unfolds we find that there may be more than one agenda to this mission and perhaps more than one target as cooked up by the CIA.<br /><br />The story is fast paced which makes it difficult to find a place to stop and eat dinner or sleep.  Interspersed throughout the novel are \\"one-liners\\" by some of the main characters that some may find annoying but I felt added to the reading enjoyment.  The characters are believable and unforgettable.  The dialogue's pacing drops the reader right into the action.<br /><br />I have read all of DeMille's novels and have always looked forward to his next release.  As in the past this one is not a disappointment.  He is one of the few author's who take the time to research and write a truly great novel, unlike others who churn out poor quality novels ever few months.  This is a 5 Star novel and I highly recommend it.

Gideon takes back his alpha male role in this book and his is hot!  Eva comes off willed and smart in this book. Sometimes a little annoying but in the end she shows what she is made of.
B005IEGUDY|4.0|Sarum tells 6000 years of English history by fictionalizing the daily life of people living on the Salisbury Plain. I especially liked the chapters on the formation of the English Channel and the building of Stonehenge. I found most of Sarum very engaging, even though I am not a history buff.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|We are a family of people who love horses. This is a great story about the nobility of the horse. The star, (the horse, of course) makes it through harrowing circumstances that would crush mere men. That's why it's a great story. The plot reminded me a little of Black Beauty, but it's different enough to be interesting. Not to mention the photography is phenomenal. I recommend it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once you start this book it's so hard to put it down. I can't wait for the next book coming in December.  I already have it preordered.  This is a very romantic story..
0316223239|5.0|This book was hard to put down, especially from the middle on.  It's a strange but captivating story.  I had no problem with Jack's use of language, word order or tenses.  Having heard ony his mother speak in five years, she could have spent all her time correcting him.  Instead she chose to try to feed him balanced meals, exercise and develop his intellectual curiosity, all in an 11x11 foot room.  I'm glad the story continued to develop instead of ending in the middle.<br />I will look on Amazon for more books by Donoghue.  This is a terrific read.
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I shouldn't have waited so long to see Drive. I *didn't* see it until now for the same reasons probably many people *did* go see it, and were then disappointed: in my area, it was marketed like a car chase action movie. I have to be in the right mood for those, and I just wasn't at the time it was in theaters. But I should have gone to see it on the big screen when it was out (and I should have remembered that Gosling was compulsively watchable in Half Nelson). Instead I finally saw it via Netflix on my 47\\" TV. There is a local movie revival house that sometimes screens cult movies at midnight or matinees, and I'm hoping that they screen Drive one of these days, so I can finally see it on the big screen. I feel it should be seen on a big screen, although it fares well on a big screen TV in a small living room!<br /><br />Drive is no car chase movie. And although there is a lot of driving, much of it is meditative and quiet, the protagonist (Ryan Gosling) alone in his car, safely ensconced away from the rest of the world. Despite the dangers inherent in the stunt (and getaway car) driving he does, he is such a tightly wound and controlled character that you sense there is little danger in what he does for a living, and that he is in total control of the car. The problem is that life lever lets anyone stay in total control for long, and life is far more dangerous in its unpredictability than the controlled and choreographed chaos of a movie set.<br /><br />Others have described the plot in detail, so I won't go into it here, except to say that while it seems to be fairly simple and straightforward, the old adage applies. Simple does not necessarily mean easy as many a 40s noir pic has told  us before. The protagonist's efforts to positively influence the outcome of the situations unfortunately do not bear the fruit you sense he hopes for.<br /><br />This is a movie that tells its story with a stylized visual economy and surprisingly little dialogue. It tells the storywithout telegraphing major plot points first, yay; I'm so tired of movies having to foreshadow everything so heavily because they assume the audience is stupid. As a result, I was genuinely surprised by the plot twists, which doesn't often happen to me anymore. Yet despite the fact that Drive's clear, often stark visuals tell the story in a fairly straightforward, if noir and moody, style, it bears repeat watching -- I'm already on my third viewing.<br /><br />Gosling gives a finely nuanced performance, but I felt the rest of the ensemble were all very well cast, especially Brian Cranston, Albert Brooks, and Ron Perlman. Carey Mulligan is possibly the weakest link, though not really, since her character seems deliberately somewhat emotionally ambiguous and fuzzy-edged. I wondered while watching how Michelle Williams might have played it, but that's nothing against Mulligan; she pulls it off with a similarly nuanced performance to Gosling's, but it is Gosling and Cranston who really stand out. Christina Hendricks, who has only a bit part, also holds her own in her scenes, although her character is the least developed and the most cliche. Brooks plays against type the most, but Perlman is effective in his coarse, greedy, mob-connected character.<br /><br />Mulligan and Gosling build a believable sexual tension and chemistry until you are practically aching for them to come together in a way you sense they must be aching for each other. As the plot unfolds, you realize that both hold themselves back from each other and are somewhat reserved, either by their nature (Gosling's character) or by their circumstances (Mulligan's), or both.<br /><br />When Gosling's character seizes the moment and they finally come together, he passionately unfurls all that pent up tension and Mulligan's character authentically responds. The immediate aftermath of that sweetness and passion makes it even more poignant, when it quickly becomes apparent that it was motivated as much or more bya fierce protectiveness as it was by passion. His protectiveness is necessarily brutal in eliminating a truly evil threat, in the way that men fiercely protect that which they most care about. But his brutality clearly unnerves and frightens her, in the way that women always become frightened of men when they show their true capacity for violence.<br /><br />This story is told with a beautiful visual economy. There are cliche-ish helicopter-shot overhead views of the glittering downtown LA skyscrapers sprinkled here and there throughout the movie. Yet you sense that those are included to contrast with the low level interior shots in the apartments, grocery store, auto shop, and especially inside the cars, which feel even more intimate by comparison. The cinematography and direction portray this interior/exterior dichotomy. The vast majority of the truly bloody violence occurs in close quarters between people. The car chases, crashes, and the use of cars as weapon are the only non-bloody violence, and they naturally occur outside. It's as if, in the protagonist's world, the threat posed by people and their physical proximity is much more dangerous than the implied threats of violence inherent in cars driven for stunts or robbery getaways.<br /><br />The dialogue is also very economical. One of the most interesting aspects of the film is that so much is told visually, you almost don't need dialogue at all in the first 40-45 minutes of the movie. Paradoxically, the chemistry between Gosling and Mulligan is enhanced by them so rarely speaking. Her shining eyes, the upturned corner of his lip, the way they hold each other's gazes -- it really builds the tension. The same goes for the relationship that builds between her son Benicio and the Driver. A lot of it is built in smiles, stares, and shared gazes, before he ever picks the kid up to carry him inside to bed.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't mention the soundtrack. There is a reason it was hot on Itunes lastyear. Though the moods conjured are very different, the way the soundtrack was used in Drive reminded me a lot of the way the soundtrack was used in The Virgin Suicides (which was scored by Air, not Cliff Martinez, who scored Drive). I was surprised, and then not, when I found out that Cliff Martinez had also done the soundtrack to Soderberg's remade Solaris with Clooney, which was also very haunting and moody. The synthy electronica of Drive's soundtrack harkens back to the 80s for me, but it still feels very modern in its throwback/retro way. It also reminded me a bit of the soundtrack to Risky Business, by Tangerine Dream. Turns out (I read later) that that was intentional on the part of the director.<br /><br />If you liked those soundtracks and the way they suited and underscored the mood and characters of those movies, you'll probably like Drive's soundtrack. By the same token, if you like the synthpop sounds of the likes of Kraftwerk, early Depeche Mode (when Vince Clarke was still with them, before he started Yaz with Alison Moyet), Yaz, and Gary Numan, you'll like Drive's soundtrack. I always hated the way that so many 80s and 90s movies turned into stitched together music videos, with dialogue-less scenes where the protagonist trains for his/her wrestling meet/dance-off to the sounds of some 80s pop. In those particular movies (Virgin Suicides, Risky Business, and Drive), though the soundtrack is almost a character in the film, it is not off-putting to me the same way those stupid movie montages are... probably because none of those movies have those stupid protagonist-training-for-wrestling-meet/dance-competition scenes.<br /><br />I have not seen other movies by this director, but I plan to. And next time Gosling is in a film, I'll go see it, no matter how it's marketed (or mis-marketed), because so far everything I've seen him in has been really good, or he's been really good in it, or both. While he theoretically has that eye candy appeal, he really doesn't show any skin in this movie. (Although he is rather poured into his tight jeans, white Ts, and denim jacket. But then, Christina Hendricks is similarly poured into her clothes). In fact, none of the main characters shows any skin in this movie, and the movie does not suffer for that. Later, a brief scene in a strip club show tons of T&A. But that scene is so matter of fact, and the strippers are such copies of each other, they're more like Stepford Strippers. That this is the only scene with nudity of any kind makes me wonder if the director meant to thumb his nose at the ubiquity of nudity in Hollywood. In fact, that lack of skin for the two main characters -- the Driver and Irene -- might be what makes their relationship that much more compelling, in this era of \\"show everything.\\"<br /><br />A note about the violence: some people would undoubtedly describe this as a terribly violent film. I disagree; I've seen gorefests that had 20 times the amount of violence and gore that this film has.<br /><br />What sets Drive's violence apart is the fact that it is not action porn; it is violent punctuation of the story's plot points. It reminded me of the violence in Eastern Promises: brief but startling, brutal, bloody and realistic. This is not the kind of violence you cheer on like an action hero offing his numerous opponents in cartoonish, splattery ways. This is much more like real life violence: infrequent, short-lived, brutal, bloody, and liable to make you upset or at least uncomfortable. Be prepared for that.
B00846REIS|4.0|After reading 50 Shades.... I didn't know where to go next. Bared to you came highly recommended. I didn't like it as much as 50 but I did enjoy it. Gideon and Eva both have issues from their past but form a bond. Gideon is young, powerful, handsome and rich. When these two come together they have much more than just sexual desire to deal with. Part two is called Reflected In You
B003YP7N9O|3.0|I know I stole a Tom Petty line for a title but it fits. The 5.1 is disappointing and no real benefit over the straight live show and honestly IA's babble before each song is annoying when you are listening clean & sober. Maybe back in the day I would have bought his patter but now I just want the music. I actually find it hard to listen to the live stuff. The main attraction is the original disc over my old worn LP but paying for the other cd/dvd seems pointless. My 3 star rating could easily have lost a star or two but I'm feeling generous today.
0156030209|4.0|Unlike many people, I was not that interested in the religious themes, but they didn't bother me either. I really like the reflection on how our stories contribute to our identity, to our own mythology, and how they may or may not depart from \\"reality\\". I wish the relations between the two versions had been more central to the book. Some passages are very \\"graphic\\" and some a bit over the top, but most are very touching, intriguing and thought-provoking. That said, I enjoyed the book a lot, was eager to keep reading, and can't wait to see the movie adaptation. I recommend it warmly.

In reading books lately by Cormac McCarthy, Mark Helprin, and David Maine (all 3 authors I greatly admire) their work sometimes suffered from overlong descriptions, lack of actual story or an unsatisfactory ending.<br /><br />So this book was a quite enjoyable since it was not plagued by any of those problems. Ian McEwan is a genius and I admit that I am not really up to the task of adequately reviewing him. Others have competently described the plot but I will say that McEwan has a seamless style that draws the reader in and made me get lost in his prose. The ending is solid and satisfying. I found this novel very similar to Atonement in some respects. I can't say more because this is definitely a book you don't want to know too much about. Ian McEwan has a way of leading (manipulating?) the reader down a path until I am suddenly left wondering how exactly did he just do that?? He can be a magician when you weren't expecting one. I know I have read a very good novel when I am thinking about it after and it continues to resonate.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have to admit at the start I am only on book two but so far I am really enjoying these books. The fist one I read in only a day, the second one I thought was slow starting but now is very gripping as well. I think they are written for a younger audience but I am 51 and enjoy them...as I did the Harry Potter series ([[ASIN:0545162076 Harry Potter Paperback Box Set (Books 1-7)]]). All in all good stories and I recommend.
B005K17RU0|5.0|its a wonderful app. works great on my kindle. i have friends and family spread throughout the world. i can just sit at home and check the temperature of all those places. and that too very accurately. i love it. plus it has different coloured themes. get this app for sure.
B000002J09|5.0|Saying this is one of the best albums in history would be an understatement.  Its not perfect and I really don't even like some songs here but Going to California is just an incredible song.  SWTH and Levee are perfect.  What an unbelievable set of songs those are.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I  cant wait to get my hands on the 2nd book! what going to happen next!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have this bane on my ipod and I really want it for this because I know it will be better every time I try to download it it says error try again later.
B00023GFOA|1.0|If you are looking to pick up Sabbath on vinyl do NOT buy the Rhino editions.  Spend the few extra bucks and get the NEMS versions.  Rhino did nothing but take the terrible original US pressings of the CD and put that on vinyl - complete with the inexplicable lift in volume about 2 minutes in to War Pigs.  Stay as far away from all the Rhino editions as you can.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked this book very much. It is very detailed and the emotional roller coaster it sends you on is great!!! This series is great!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Rick Riordan again did a good job with this book. It's action packed, lots of adventure and very entertaining. I found that he went trough some parts of the story a bit faster than I would've liked but it's not a big deal. I just wish the next book would already be out!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I like it but its just that it pops up every time I unplug the charger and plug back in and it is just SUPER ANNOYING because I could be almost to the high score in jetpack joyride the and then my charger unpligs and the stupid app pops up and I lose my place and die! I would suggest it if you like losing your place.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is not what I was expecting. But it did keep my interest. I'm looking forward to the final book in this series.
B008GVD6D8|3.0|i found the first half of the book to be quite frustrating with all the drama (maybe too much so?) going back and forth between the Gideon and Eva..  However, the second half of the book redeemed itself with the twists and turns of the plot.  Im not really sure where Sylvia will go to from here with the third book, and Im not sure if I'll read it.  But then again...
B003JIPJRE|5.0|Being a huge fan of the Batfamily, I had high expectation for this movie and it did not disappoint. Everything was spot on from the personalities of Red Hood and Nightwing to the complicated relationship between Bruce and his boys. I also found that friends who are not as familiar with the Batfamily were able to really enjoy this movie and its dark undertones
B0081J95TE|5.0|If you like synth rock or just a general garbage/Shirley Manson fan...this album rocks.  Sure, Systematic Automatic is a \\"pop\\" type song, but it's a damn good one.  Most of the songs are great, and catchy....and a lot are in very different ways.<br /><br />Even the bonus tracks are pretty damn good...my favorite being \\"The One\\" by far.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Awesome reading! a must-have book for any  all Lincoln enthusiast!   so much detailed history!!!!  so many characters who served honorably during the darkest days of our country‘s time!!!
B007XU0N1G|2.0|I really dont understand why all people totally love this one, I think its one of the most boring things I have ever heard.<br /><br />I'm probably going to be bashed because of this but everyone has the right to their own opinion.<br />I really love Rhapsody Of Fire and all of their albums even though the last one wasnt that good.<br />This one however I had high hopes for because you know, its Luca Turilli and he is the master, and if he puts the name Rhapsody on his music it has to be his greatest bombardment and therefor have to be awesome.<br /><br />But I was fooled. The singer really sucks and is annoying to listen to, and the songs barely have anything to remember or feel for when you listen to it. Almost no great choruses or verse, and yeah.. just a waste of money imo.<br /><br />Very disappointed in this and I cant understand why everyone loves it. Its a shame that this great line up of musicians couldnt do better. But give it a try if you like Rhapsody Of Fire.
B008RV5K4U|5.0|I just loved it.. Shows a new dimension to the Dark Knight never though of.. Awesome that he will be training a new Robin who is female.  Awesome!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a fun game mind numbing in a good way<br />played for hours. great graphics and quality sound. reminds me of the arcade game but is free
B0091REZMW|3.0|I started the game 2 minutes ago, and it already asked me to download graphics, and rate it. it is a fine app, but I don't appreciate everything it asks.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|I didn't really love this book, in the end I just wanted to finish this to find out what was happening. The concept was interesting, and I would have liked to have seen more following the grand reveal. However 75% of the book is about the protagonist, Ethan, getting beaten up to near death multiple times again and again. What kept me from being enthralled in the story telling was how extreme his injuries were after each fight, and yet his miraculous ability to function with pretty minimal side effects. In the end [Spolier] it feels like the protagonist just submits to the bad guys. :/...
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you are a 50 Shades fan, I highly recommend this series.  Not quite as intense, but still a great read.  You will fall for Gideon and Eva very quickly.  You will not be disappointed.
B005D4Y4H8|5.0|What can one say watching these videos?!  Only one thing: it is a pity that Glenn Gould left us so early and it is a blessing that he spent so many hours, days, months and years in studio and left us with absolutely great memories of him.
0316228532|2.0|I'm upset that this book was such a disappointment. I read all genre of books, so I didnt start reading this expecting another Harry Potter. I did expect to be drawn into the book and unable to put it down. and it was so bad I found reasons not to read it.<br />She starts off by switching characters in each section but then gradually just switches randomly and you have to go back and find where things got confusing. Also your to the end of the book before you have a firm grasp on who is who and what their personalities are.<br />Also I think her idea of an adult novel is being boring, and throwing in a few crude sex references and scenes. This book was beyond boring to me, and I only finished it because I was hoping that somewhere along the way I would get sucked in. It never happened.<br />I gave this two stars for two reasons: 1. I love JK Rowling and couldnt bring myself to give just one, and 2. I did tear up just a little (not much) on the very LAST page!<br />Please dont buy if you can avoid it. get it from your local library if you feel you must read this book.
B004EWFUQY|4.0|The book was easy to read and was well explained, easy to follow.  It really spells out for you what the diet includes and does not include.  It totally works if you follow it.  It has to be a lifestyle change.  I originally read this on my Kindle but have since gotten a hard copy so that it is easier to flip through.
B006C1DH92|4.0|good options and graphics. The challenges are always slightly different which keeps things interesting. The music keeps things lively as well. I recommend..
B008673ZAQ|5.0|OMG I loved this book. It picked up right where the first book left off and it stayed within the same plot, and it didn't venture off and create a whole new plot. It showed you a side of Gideon that you would expect and how much he cares for Eva. I CANNOT WAIT FOR THE FINAL BOOK!!!!!
B0053O89KG|5.0|This series just gets better and better with each season<br />This is one of three tv series that I buy
0920668372|1.0|This may well be the most disturbing children's book I've read. Every night the mom waits until her baby is asleep and then crawls across the floor to his bed, creeps over the side, picks him up and holds him on her lap, and chants an incantation about how she will love him forever and as long as she lives she will be his mother. She continues crawling into his room in the dead of night through his teenage years. When he moves to his own house she drives across town with an extension ladder strapped to the roof of his car, breaks into his house, crawls across his floor, picks him up like a baby, and chants at him. And when she's dying she calls him to her house and he does the same thing to her! This book may as well be subtitled \\"The Norman Bates Story.\\" The final page shows the grown son holding his baby girl, carrying on the obsessive tradition as he chants. No mention is made in the book of his wife, who is no doubt wrapped in trash bags in the trunk of his mother's station wagon.
0425263908|1.0|If you read 50 shades of Grey don't bother same story line almost same story at points. Don't waste your time or money. Not a fan.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|is a very good product accessible and interesting my family love it i recomended is not an apple but look like a thanks
B008O037RG|5.0|Mumford & sons did a terrific job, love this album, love this band! I am very impressed, the only thing I don't like is broken crown because of the F-bombs, I can't play the album in the car because ill get in trouble if that song comes on and my parents hear the F-bomb, but othe than that FANTASTIC album!
B004222UC8|4.0|This is a really good CD. It went under my radar for a long, long time. I always thought of either the \\"Ozzy\\" Sabbath or the \\"Dio\\" Sabbath.... I totally missed this. The bonus disc is kind of cool, you get to hear two different singers interpret some the songs. The songs, playing and singing are really good. This sounds more like the \\"Dio\\" version of Sabbath. I only bought this because I happened to hear \\"The Shinning\\" on the radio, check it out, if you like Dio, you'll probably like this.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have found most books set in this era are written from the male point of view. This book, however, gives the perspective from two women who are each enslaved in their own way. I highly recommend this book for a heartwrenching read. Be prepared for the tears.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|This has been and always will be a favorite Hitchcock film.  I still think it is a very good movie.
B0006GAI6O|5.0|I teach a film class at a university, and I want to show this film along with its Japanese original, \\"Shall We Dansu?\\" to my  students. This English version clearly contrasts a very different social-cultural world from that of Japan, and especially how women are portrayed in two cultures, while human sentiments remain remarkably similar between the two cultures. I especially found the narrated version (English edition) by the director quite illuminating, as he succinctly summarizes the differences between the two films at the outset. I recommend this film to anyone interested in cultural studies. I also highly recommend it to be seen together with the Japanese version directed by Suō Masayuki. It is one entertaining way to look deeper into cultural differences and similarities.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|accidently downloaded this game but glad I did!  easy to play and doesn't take much effort to gain prizes or acquire more coins!
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee is an amazing young lady. I love her book and her willingness to share her story. I hope she can put her kidnap/rape/etc. story in the past, so it doesn't define her for the rest of her life.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia day is a remarkable writer, I have personally enjoyed both the first & second book of the series. Reflected in you begins as bared to you left off. Gideon & eva's story is not your average guy falls for girl & they live happily ever after. They have real life struggles & difficult hardships that many readers can relate too, which makes it that much more appealing maybe except for the hot sex bc im not sure who has a Gideon cross in there life with all that stamina, sigh....,a girl can dream! As a reader I felt for the characters back stories & the choices, decisions they made to maintain there relationship. Thanks Sylvia! Can't wait for EWY
B002RI9YCI|5.0|This is the most delightful and witty book I have read in a long time.  I don't think I will ever be able to watch the Queen at an official event again without wondering if she has a book in her handbag !  A quick easy read but one that I will return to many times for its sheer audacity, charm and smile worthiness.
B001QB9H1A|5.0|the DVD was in great condition. the movie itself was made perfectly. Jason Statham at his finest. I love everything about this movie and wouldn't change a thing.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|I have read this book twice! Don't let the size of the book scare you, it's an easy read. Make sure to keep a highlighter handy... you're going to want to mark it up like I did mine.
B007SGM084|5.0|Whoa! Fasten your seatbelt ladies; you are in for a bumpy ride. I had a love/hate relationship with Grey, but he knows how to trip your trigger!
B003NX76BM|5.0|I have all of Nora's books. I was a big fan before I bought my kindle. But I had to put this one on my kindle as its a favorite I have read multiple times. Aside from Roarke in her In Death series Simon is my favorite character. He is so reluctant to be involved but he cares deeply. What a guy! Love it! I am Never disappointed in her books but this is one of her best!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The Best of Me was a great book it captured my heart from the beginning. This book show how you should never judge someone from how they look on the outside. This love story is a classic but even though the outcome is bittersweet. I kind of wish it would have ended a little different. But i still loved the ending as is. When you start reading the best of me you will be pulled into it and not want to put it down great book
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great book! Much better than bared to you. The delectable saga of Eva and Gideon continues with some unexpected twists!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|I've read this author before and was mildly pleased with his insights but this book was not his usual \\"milk toast\\" offerring. If you're ready, and truly seeking, you will not be disappointed. If you're not ready and don't \\"get it\\", put the book aside and try again later when you are ready. This is knowledge that will change your life.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|Nothing beats Zz Top. Love hearing the oldies and the quality is good. \\"Best of\\" albums are my favorites. Get to hear the ones I know better than the newer stuff.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Beautiful graphics.  One of the best match three games I've played.  Very addicting.  Would buy from this developer again.<br /><br />at
0736092269|5.0|Totally worth $10-$20 i have owned the original edition and this one.every personal trainer should own one. Some of the lifts I do not use as they are out of date and dangerous (like behind the neck pulls and presses). But the ablity to show a client exactly what muscles they are hitting on a particular lift or similar lift is very helpful..
B001VTTRC6|5.0|I loved the story line in this movie.  The acting power of Sean Penn was phenominal.  I wanted to watch this movie to see why Sean Penn was nominated for the Oscar.  He was outstanding.  The power that emanted from his performance could be felt.  His portrayal of the grieving Father is one of the best that I have seen.  I also liked the intellectual challenge of the film.  It posed real questions of \\"what would you do if this happened to you\\"?<br /><br />I enjoy watching films that are directed by Clint Eastwood, he must be a true director to get such a performance from an actor of Sean Penn's caliber.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Very helpful. I really enjoyed this book because it not only had a lot of helpful information in various aspects of life, but it also felt real. It was not just some psychologist telling you what was wrong with you, she seemed like an old friend telling you exactly what you needed to hear.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|She is absolutley true to the hype about her voice. I love listening to this CD. Adele tells her love story through her voice.
B005D0RDKW|5.0|I think that for true rush fans, this is the most fun you can have at home. What a great way too spend 2hrs. This is one of the best live concert videos out. I give it 5 out of 5. Enjoy it!!!!
B0091REZMW|4.0|could use a better ratio of energy used to perform tasks. less likely to play as long or as often if I use all my energy performing only one or two tasks in the game.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Nice graphics and good game play. A nice twist on the match 3 genre. Go ahead and download it now!
B005LAJ212|5.0|totally rivetting.  twists and turns of the plot kept us wishing for more. Intertwined schemes and devious characters are thrilling.
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|I have yet to read a Reacher novel that did not hold my attention from the get go. This one is no exception. I never lose continuity as is so easily done with some other authors.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book awsome better than the first one. I couldnt put it down finished it in 2 days. Cant wait to Dec for the 3rd one. I like this book better an Fifty Shades I would recommend to everyone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! I am totally addicted!!!  graphics are great and the game is very challenging!! I love it!!
B001OST0LW|4.0|With all due credit to Tim Burton's direction and Michael Keaton's portrayal in the first two Batman movies, this third entry, Batman Forever, is by far my favorite. (Technically, it's the fourth, if you count the tv movie with Adam West.)  Val Kilmer plays Bruce Wayne/Batman in this outing. And while the previous two movies with Keaton as Batman are serious and sinister, this Batman is more comic-book like in its appearance, and often campy and more fun. (There is a great gag as the camera shows Batman in his new outfit and they focus in on his butt.) There are several carry-over gags taken from the tv series; like when Robin (Chris O'Donnell) remarks \\"Holy rusted metal, Batman!\\"... the way Robin of the tv series always made that kind of remark.  Tommy Lee Jones plays Two-Face and Jim Carrey plays The Riddler. Both of their performances are wild and over-the-top... perhaps a bit too much so. (As a side note: None of the Batman villains can hold a candle to Jack Nicholson's outstanding portrayal of The Joker in Tim Burton's Batman.) A really nice part of the story is the gradual friendship and pairing of Batman and Robin... giving the full story of their meeting and becoming partners.  All in all, this Batman is the most fun and enjoyable. And I think Val Kilmer makes a better Batman than Michael Keaton or George Clooney. But, that's just my taste.  By the way... if you're considering completing your Batman collection with Batman And Robin (the George Clooney Batman), don't bother... that fourth entry in this series is a poor addition.
B008TRUDAS|3.0|It must have been an oversight on my part, but I saw no mention made of the fact that this is what I consider to be \\"young adult\\" fiction. IS it? Does it matter? Probably not, except I found it hard to relate to the characters (I have not been a young adult in-well-awhile). And maybe more than that, the story got pretty corny in spots. Even so, I did end up finishing it, so the characters and their struggles were compelling to me. Final word: \\"Meh...\\"
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena is a great book, and a great sequel to every book Rick has written so far. I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys either series. (Olympians or Heroes)<br /><br />(Mild Spoilers MAY follow)<br />I found it a bit frustrating that the book jumped between perspectives, as with the heroes split up into groups, you only got one or two firsthand accounts of certain events, and others were only mentioned briefly by one character to another. The dialogue was great, if a bit formulaic, though I personally thought there were to many mentions of Hazel having died previously. It seemed she would constantly be saying the phrase, \\"When I was alive... the first time.\\", for clarification, when her companions should now this by now. But these flaws take little from the actual story, and the story was exactly what I have come to expect from Mr. Riordan, interesting, satisfying, but always leaving you waiting for the next novel.
B002APU580|5.0|Kiera Knightly plays such an excellent Elizabeth. I've seen the other editions of the tale and this one is my favorite. Donald Sutherland is even sexy as Mr. Bennett. A great movie you can't watch just once.
B008ENNXQI|5.0|This was a great movie! Excellent acting. I was surprised at how much I liked it. Cool graphics too! Julia Roberts makes a great villain.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow, very good story line, grabs you and keeps you wanting more.  The sex scenes are intense!  Loved everything about this book and hope that the next 2 are just as juicy and delicious.  Great read!
B00336C3EY|5.0|To me, four stars means that I'm still thinking about the movie the next day.  I'm still thinking about this movie - and I saw it five days ago!<br /><br />As interesting as it is entertaining.<br /><br />But people unfamiliar with Judaism may have some difficulty following it in a few parts.<br /><br />You'll never see \\"But I didn't do anything!\\" as a worthwhile excuse again.
034580404X|5.0|I enjoy reading the book.  The book was very enjoyable. I did not expect it to enjoy the book but i was very surprise to like it.
B008133DO8|5.0|Being a Sherlock Holmes fan, I really love this adaptation!  I just wish I didn't have to wait a year until the next season comes out!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you loved the first book you will love the second.  Scenes are steamy as the first book.  You start to understand the characters behaviors more
B00001OH7U|5.0|I love David Bowie's \\"Station to Station\\" album. These songs are not always played in the main stream yet are catchy, nice rock.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A very quick read..could not put it down as I needed to know as Eva did what was happening..her life spinning out of control..or so she thought..Gideon has her in the dark to protect her.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out 12/31!!
B008XG1X18|4.0|awesome app but it stops working a lot and you have to force it to close. pintrest itself is awesome
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved this book!  Another novel I couldnt put down and looking forward to the third novel due out in Nov.  If you loved 50 Shades then you will not be disappointed with Sylvia Day's Barred to You and the sequel, Reflected in You.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Episodic TV tends to drag on giving few answers week to week. This series shows you what happened at the end then goes back and fills in the details. Amazingly consistent from start to finish. I started watching mid-series and new certain aspects of the story that was not revealed yet, and say how they were able to hint but not spoil the surprises ahead.<br /><br />The villains have a backstory - you actually begin to understand and sometimes sympathize with them.<br /><br />I think this is my favorite series of all time. And that they wrapped up the major plot point in season one is fantastic. I was satisfied at the end and ready for the next chapter in Season 2.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray features were fun to listen to and watch. Finding out that most of the fairytale land sets are CGI blew me away. Sure some of the over the top stuff like the dragons would have to be, but as far as simple (and not so simple rooms) I had no idea. It's that well done.
B000002GY9|5.0|Tom Waits \\"Small Change\\" is a timeless album. I owned it on vinyl. This is some super creative stuff and I highly recommend.
B00932HEX2|5.0|An incredible series - one everyone should watch - but the access to it was spot on. A wonderful way to catch up on past seasons whenever you want.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really like match 3 games but they had gotten a bit boring until I started playing Call of Atlantis. It adds a story line and many challenging changes in the game that make it fun and addicting. I love the graphics and music too. It's a must play!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series of books are so well written and such page turners I have a hard time putting them down. A Dance With Dragons, book 5, is another stunner. I don't think I have ever read books that take you inside a world of such complexity and descriptive detail. George R R Martin is a creative master. If you have not seen the HBO series Game of Thrones, it is a must see. It brings the books alive and is so well done. Season 3 starts in March 2013. George, please keep writing this series. I will keep reading them!
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|I am kind of disappointed in this blu ray disc collection. It is good don't get me wrong these films are great but I was really looking for a more in the special features like deleted scenes. This collection was put out by the same people who put together the Star Wars on blu ray collection in which they did an awesome job with the special features with a lot of deleted scenes and other extras so I guess you can say I was kind of expecting the same thing out of the Indiana Jones blu ray collection.
B000002KCF|5.0|Michael Franks Art of Tea is great soft music. This album is one of my all time favorite soft music albums.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Reads like you are having a conversation w/ the author out on the porch, under the live oaks of his native Texas. Makes you truly appreciate what the men & women in our armed forces do every day to defend our right to read what we want, when & where we want.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Best book out of the series so far!!! I loved it!!...well except the ending....but otherwise it was awesome!! I would definetly recommend this book to other people especially older kids and teens!!! Just so awesome!!!XD
B008MG1E4A|3.0|In reading this book,I failed to find anything new about the operation that hadn't been reported previously on TV and in the daily newspapers. I truly believe that the timing of the release of Mark Owen's book was simply political manipulation by the Obama Democratic Administration related primarily to the upcoming Presidential Election. V.S.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can't wait to read the next installment. So addicting and can't wait to see what happens to Eva and Gideon! Love them both!
B000059T1E|5.0|Traffic's \\"John Barleycorn\\" is a super album. Can't miss vocals and a superlative band. The combination makes for some of the best music of its time and for all time. A must own.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|only wish there was a calendar with reminders to make the lists more useful. otherwise super easy to use and helps keep me organized
B008LY9AWG|3.0|as usual his stories are first class. feeeled with excellent life in the lapd.It so wonder he is where he is
B007S3S8HO|2.0|This crazy thing is so impossible to put together. It took my husband and my daughter FOREVER to put it together. Once they finally figured it out and got all put together, it fell apart immediately. Then you have to put it all back together again? Forget it!<br /><br />it gets two stars instead of just one because the slingshot portion is somewhat fun to do on it's own and the little birds and pigs are actually pretty cute. Otherwise, it's overpriced, hard to put together and shoddily made. Stay away.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I just got this game and I love it u should definetly get it and this app is mobile u can play it without wifi.  :)
B0053O89JM|4.0|The final season of House, particularly the last episode, was well done and a fitting ending to the series. This DVD set completed my collection, and I look forward to revisiting the twisted genius of Gregory House. I hope to see more of Hugh Laurie in the future...a brilliant actor!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|This game is great for tennis lover's and it's a time killer as well. I strongly recommend for anyone with spare time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest app is wonderful!  I love how you can pin things and go back to browsing easily. So glad I got this for my Kindle.
B000FC11A6|5.0|Enormously enjoyable! I had to peel myself off the book to get any work done! It was fun, educational and thrilling. I loved the characters, they became like old friends. I hadn't read such a good story in ages.
B00328R21C|5.0|Very happy with speed of delivery and the item itself. My six  year old  nephew played with it for two hours without even opening his other gifts for that whole time!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Some good characters and a few interesting twists and turns, but the way they left it i couldn't help but wonder \\"that's it??\\"<br /><br />The 3 stars was being a little bit kind;  would actually be somewhere in between 2 and 3 for me.  It wasn't horrible...if somebody found a paperback copy in the bargain bin i'd tell them to check it out, but i would definitely not recommend that someone spend $12.99 to get it for their kindle.
B001OKGV6W|5.0|The film is very good...the book was a much richer story with more insight into Carl Sagan's philosophy.<br /><br />Enjoy both!!!!!!!!
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Like the previous two books of this trilogy, this book was no less compelling. Picking up the story in a seamless way, the drama built up and up - and I found it hard to put the book down even for meals. From the first sentence to the last, I found it compelling and gripping. Wonderfully written. What a pity Stieg Larsson is no longer with us - but how fortunate that he left such a legacy. I can see myself reading all three of these books again one day.
B009JZZRGE|5.0|Because the channel that The Good Wife is on was not functioning on my satellite, I was devastated to think that I would be unable to watch this show.  Thanks to my Kindle and the excellent reception, I was able to watch the show after all! Thank you Kindle Fire for making my day!!!!
B0042KZJ46|5.0|I had seen Bob Marley when he hit the Stanley two years earlier. He came with no opener. Everybody slowly stood up at the beginning of the concert and never sat down, it was an amazing experience. The opening song of this concert is heart wrenching, you can feel that Bob knew he was sick, but the story to this album is his faith, the concert was strong the music is beautiful, and by the end of it the band is rocking out in full force. I felt very lucky to be able to see Bob in action as a kid, as little as I knew of the world at the time, and I now feel very lucky that the folks decided to put this out, as it is a very historical piece of work.  Also worth checking out is the Marley Biography (which led me to this) Highly recommended

B0063IH60K|5.0|I recently retired after 36yrs. In the classroom.  I enjoy solitaire on my iPad.  I feel it keeps my brain active, without  too much challenge or frustration.  It actually relaxes me and I enjoy it more than TV!

B008I3QZKU|1.0|Im a fan of the Killers and I have seen them in concert, but their latest ablum sucks. It is worse than the Day and Age CD (cant stand Human). They need to get the vibe back from their two previous cd's Hott Fuse & Sams town!

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love the music that plays. I find it very relaxing. Also like how it will reset after there are no more pairs so I can finish the game.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This was very good and it was great to hear the truth instead of the media spin. A fast read, it describes the \\"brotherhood\\" that it must be amazing to be a part of.  I also really enjoyed \\"American Sniper\\" which gives a great insight into what goes into a \\"team\\".
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, I enjoyed it a lot. It was very factual compaired to the media discription. Good luck to the seals on future missions.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I received my DVD of \\"Homeland\\" the first season shortly after ordering it.  It was in perfect condition upon arrival.  My husband and I have become engrossed in this show and I can't wait until the second season comes out on DVD so we can purchase and watch it as well.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I have been waiting to read a memoir from John Taylor, my first pin-up love, for years. I was a huge Duranie. JT always came off as very articulate and smart in interviews and that's what he is in this book. Though not the most detailed filled memoir, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and have even more respect for JT.<br /><br />Though he could have told detailed accounts of the sordid aspects of his life, he glazes over these. He admits to the addictions and countless one-night stands as these are no secrets, but he gives very few details. Most rock memoirs will give at least one graphic description of an incident, but JT does not. He is very respectful of the people who were involved and only even names about six women with whom he was involved. There is only one description of what he experienced on a trip. While he really could have become bogged down in the mire, he keeps the pace moving.<br /><br />What is most touching is his paean to his parents, which is truly lovely. They may not have always understood what their son wanted to do, but they let him do it and supported him. His description of their love story brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />In many respects, this memoir reads like a recovering addict's testimony, which it is in many ways. But the only drawback is that that doesn't let the music and the stories behind the music shine through. In interviews with Simon for example, I have sensed how close a relationship he and JT have, but there is little delving into those emotions, good or bad, in the book, and I would have liked to know more. Again, I think it is out of JT's respect for others, but I would like to have known about some of the creative battles and teamwork that went into the songs from my teenage soundtrack.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|We live in desperate times that affect many, but this book offers a solution that can change lives. Each day's practices made me feel better and better. Gratitude is now a part of my life! If I slip and don't express as much gratitude as I think I should, I feel it like a spiritual nudge! I absolutely believe that the kind of energy we send out into the Universe comes back to us, and I already see Magic happening in my life. I'm excited about where the journey will take me. Keep your heart, soul, and mind open, and read this book!
B0099G3I96|5.0|No Doubt has gotten better with age ! Gwen's voice is great. This sounds better, the more you listen to it. I am so glad they got back together.Very satisfied with this purchase.<br />Jane V.<br />Johnstown,Pa.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|Mind = Blown. Kevin Smith.. you did it again! First movie I've seen, in quiet some time, with gunshots in it that actually made me jump when shots were fired. Good stuff. Although, I can see how its a controversial movie now. Its got religion involved, as well as extremists, of both kind; the good and the bad. John Goodman played an excellent role too. I highly recommend those who aren't too scared to see more then a few sides to a story, see Red State.<br /><br />An honest opinion I have from watching this movie is;<br /><br />We should all believe in something is bigger then us,<br />We should never harm others just because they don't believe what we do,<br />We should not jump to conclusions,<br />We should think for ourselves,<br />and, of course, the golden rule,<br />We should treat others the way we would want to be treated.<br /><br />Yes, Hater's are gonna hate. Lover's are gonna love.<br /><br />5 Starred.
B005C7SXMS|3.0|I generally appreciate British humor and quirky comedies, and I really wanted to like this movie because I liked Richard Aoyade so much on \\"The IT Crowd.\\"  (Just to be clear, he's the director of the film; he does not act in it.)  It wasn't a bad little movie, but it felt pretty flat overall.  The acting was good, and the story was certainly quirky enough (in fact, a bit quirkier than I cared for), but I thought the humor wasn't all that humorous.<br /><br />What it really reminded me of was one of Wes Anderson's less successful efforts; so imagine what Wes Anderson's take on a coming-of-age film set in a Welsh town...directed on an off day for Wes Anderson...and that's pretty much what \\"Submarine\\" is like.  If that sounds awesome to you, then, seriously, have at.  Otherwise, you should probably pass.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|really fun game and good for beginners that likes the angry birds series . I enjoyed this game and I hope you do to.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I loved this app @ first but after a few days it started just not opening . uninstalled; reinstalled still not working! HTC EVO 4G
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|OMG! How will I wait another year for the next book...it's torture!<br /><br />But what a fun book/series! I love that Mr. Riordan has expanded the world of the demigods to the Roman side and that Annabeth had such a big role to play. It was great to see more of the female point of view in the demigod world (we get a lot of Sadie in the Egyptian series) and look forward to hearing more of their voices in future books.
B005FVNJTS|4.0|From a sportsman's point of view it is really interesting finding out what it takes to be so good. How do you get there? What are you thinking about. Tidbits on nutrition, training, motivation and how you think. The author has cleverly wound a young man's life into two major tennis matches keeping some suspense and interest into a life that revolves around training, competing and winning. Well written and an easy read.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I have never owned a Kindle until now and this is the first case I have purchased.  It seems to do the job although I would have like a place to place the pointer.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I found this app under the free app of the day. it has been extremely useful for my iiregular schedule so I am not constantly resetting a traditional alarm clock. it is very easy to use.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was as good if not better than the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy. All three of those books were awesome. Bared to You and Reflected in You are just as good if not better...I can not hardly wait for the 3rd in thi sseries to come out!!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed Gone Girl.  Thought it was well written and interesting in a strange and dysfunctional way.  Manipulation is the name of the game and i found it interesting how my favor shifted as the story developed.  A few pretty good twists
031617615X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is the last book in the twilight saga. I heard about this book from all of my friends. It is hard to not have heard about the twilight saga. The saga is about a human girl falling in love with a hunky vampire. I started reading Twilight and loved the book so I continued on reading the second and third book. By the time I finished the first three books, Breaking Dawn was getting ready to come out. I picked it up as soon as I could and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />The book is a continuation of the third book and is broken up into three \\"books.\\" The first book is about the wedding of Edward and Bella. The first book begins with Bella having to talk to her parents about getting married to Edward. Her dad does not take the news well but he leaves it up to Bella's mom, who he is sure will throw a fit. When Bella calls her mom, who lives in Florida, she is thrilled and offers to help with the planning. Then, the wedding passes by and there is a bigger focus on the honeymoon. Edward and Bella do married people activities and it ends with Bella pregnant, with a rapid growing child. Edward and Bella have different viewpoints on keeping the baby, and the book ends with Bella asking Edwards sister to help protect the baby. The second book is told from Jacob's perspective. He gets the news of Edward and Bella's return, and that Carlisle has told Charlie that Bella is quarantined because she has contracted a rare disease in South America. Jacob assumes that Bella has been bitten and transformed. He is upset when Sam Uley, acting Alpha of the pack, declares that the pack will not retaliate. Jacob, full of rage, decides that if the pack will not retaliate collectively, he will act by himself. Creating strategies of attack, he runs to the Cullen house. When he arrives, he discovers that things aren't what he thought. Bella, as opposed to being a newborn vampire, is already heavily pregnant with Edward's child. Everyone realizes that the child's rapid growth is starving Bella. She cannot digest her food as she gets sick after eating anything. Tension runs high in the Cullen household as Rosalie supports Bella's decision to have the baby and aids her in every way possible. Edward is furious at Rosalie and the family is divided. Things are not looking good for Bella, and Jacob is depressed over thinking that she will die and be transformed into a newborn vampire. Bella goes into labor about on month after the honeymoon. The hard placenta that surrounds the child cracks; Bella begins throwing up blood. The child breaks free and Bella is almost dead. Edward delivers the baby, a girl, Renesmee, and begins to transform Bella into a vampire. He injects his venom into her heart and bites her in several places. Jacob and Edward perform CPR to try to keep Bella's heart beating. Then, thinking that Bella is dead, Jacob leaves the room and goes on a rampage to find the baby to try and kill it. He finds her in Rosalie's arms and looks into the baby's eyes. Then, Jacob imprints on the baby. The final part is about Bella learning to be a vampire and also taking care of Renesme. Then, the Volturi come to Forks to investigate the half human half vampire baby. There is an epic battle that the Cullens end up winning and sending the Volturi away.<br /><br />This book was a great way to end the Twilight saga. It wraps everything up and brings all of the characters together. I think that this book deserves a four because it kept me on the edge of my seat but it was a very long book, 600+ pages. I think if Stephenie Meyer had  broken this book into two different parts then it would have been an easier read.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This is a little sharpener, be careful not to cut ones self using it.  but it is a nice emergency thingy to keep in the glove box,  worked great on my scissors
B000SEGUDE|4.0|An appellate attorney recommended this book, which now does not surprise me, as this book is at heart an analysis of the human condition.  Are we doomed as a species to the consequences of our history of savagery, or we will ultimately progress into a humane and civilized condition? Thanks to the author for this innovative and entertaining look at this question. Are we more than meat?
B008MEM24S|4.0|good puzzle game for any age.  It needs more levels though.  It is a good game to waste a few minutes with.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love love love this book!!!! Love Gideon and Eva. The love they have for each other is extraordinary ... cant wait for book 3. Im hooked!
B007Q35PLI|5.0|This movie is simply awesome. Temple Grandin is proof that love, and commitment can cause a child to succeed, despite what appears to be limitations. Temple's life was not easy, but she was taught, and learned that, life isn't easy for anyone. But, with hard work, perserverence, and utilizing the talent, the God given abilities one DOES have, makes the world full of possibilities. Beautiful!!!
B003FXXNBW|5.0|Every generation needs their great fight movie. In the 70s it was Enter the Dragon. In the 80s it was Bloodsport. The 90s saw Blood Fist, and now for the 2000s there is Undisputed 3. Undisputed 2 introduces Scott Adkin's character, the Russian Martial Arts Master Yuri Boyka. However, it is part three that really sees Boyka's prowess and lethality reach new heights.<br />The fights in this movie are great, the actors are convincing in their struggles in this prison fighting scheme, and Adkins and his main adversary, the Chiliean martial artist Marko Zaror pull out all the stops in a vicious final fight. In short, this is the best fight film in years.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|If you're a Muse fan, you will not be disappointed. They continue with the sound from The Resistance album and bring back that in your face punch from Absolution, and mix it all up.<br /><br />If you're expecting the dub-step sound you heard in their teaser.. it's only in 2 songs and they don't over do it, so that's just fine, because I hate dub-step.<br /><br />Buy it.. NOW!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|\\"A Wanted Man\\" was the third Lee Child novel that I've read. I found this novel to be less suspensful then the other two.<br />Maybe I'm just getting to know Jack Reacher too well?
B007NG93CK|4.0|This novel was really good and I enjoyed it immensely.  I felt that Kathy's past few books were becoming just a tad boring and formulaic.  But this one is a bit different and it was good to learn about another industry, e.g. diamond mining.  It rolled along really well but I would love to see a more permanent relationship with Ryan.
B005LAJ1O0|1.0|American Horror Story sucks. It's a show created by a bunch of lazy scumbags hoping that the audience will mistake petty theft, grand larceny and death-row worthy sloth for homage, pastiche and hipster-caliber apathy. In truth it's a giant, stinking turd and all of the washed-up actors in the world posing and preening around it will never make it smell any better.<br /><br />AHS orbits around the painfully boring, conveniently wealthy and generally uncharismatic Harmon family. Vivien, the mother and wife, has just had a miscarriage at 45 years old and she's all broken up over the loss of a pregnancy whose success was about as long a shot as my being crowned Miss America. She goes home to a capacious, minimalist mansion to weep prettily and pop pills when she hears noises from upstairs. Exploration reveals that these sounds are coming from her husband, Ben, who is nut-deep in a 20-something psych-student from a class he'd been teaching. This was his way of dealing with the miscarriage, we're eventually told. Their teenaged daughter isn't introduced right away, but when we finally meet Violet, it's made clear that her principal interests are sitting near novels by Camus while listening to prodigious amounts of nu-gaze and shallowly cutting at her forearms with straight razors, which is probably what she was doing in some dimly lit room not far away from her philandering father.<br /><br />Because these bozos are the central characters in AHS, they can't do anything rational, like get divorced and fight bitterly over everything from their daughter to a pair of Bose headphones. They have to do something completely irrational, like determine that the only way they are going to keep their family together is to pack up and move to a quaint Richardsonian Romanesque across the country that's so notorious for being an epicenter of homicide that it has become the crowning gem of an L.A. bus tour catering to murder groupies.<br /><br />They buy the house straight away, ignorant of just how blood soaked it is--even if Murder House Tours seems to drop by with its megaphone yammering tour guide every hour on the hour--and settle in for a little haunting. The ghosts include: an old workhorse maid--a young slutty maid--a Dr. Frankenstein type that's not scary, just gross--the bride of Dr. Frankenstein, who is also not scary, just a harpy--two twin boys--a possum monster that stays in the basement--the kid from The Mask, who is up in the attic--another kid that was killed by the police after performing a Columbine-like mass murder at his high school--six victims of the Columbine kid's homicidal rage--two nurses murdered by AHS's answer to Richard Speck--three faux-Speck groupies that wanted to recreate the original crime in The Murder House--the Black Dahlia--the student that was humping Ben in the beginning of the show--two gay men that, when they're not shopping for \\"ball stretchers\\" or butt-plugs that can't be removed without contacting a proctologist and a safe-cracker or rubber S&M suits, are frequently talking about having a baby (in fact, a good 2/3rds of the ghosts in AHS are obsessed with having, finding, keeping, and/or stealing a baby)--and two children and a mother who were burnt up in the house by one of the few characters who remained alive through the duration of AHS. Oh, yeah, eventually the whole Harmon family is killed too. I probably missed about a dozen other ghosts. Oh well.<br /><br />Vivien basically tackles the role of Rosemary in Rosemary's Baby. She even eats raw meat and gives birth to the Antichrist, which was raped into her by the ghost that is otherwise \\"in love\\" with her daughter. Gee, how classy...and way to think for yourselves, AHS hacks. Ben is forced to play into a kind of Jack Torrence role as his career as a psychiatrist becomes a joke thanks to extreme self-doubt, nude somnambulism and...well...taking on ghosts as patients. How does this tool get paid? Violet hangs around the Columbine killer ghost and flirts with him and talks about her affection for Morrissey when not whining about how hard it is to be spoiled half to death by parents that can buy $15,000 sofas and dream of sending her miserable butt to Harvard. Jessica Lange wanders through now and again to chew scenery with a retarded daughter in tow, along with an occasional boy-toy and a psychic that has an even shoddier grasp of history than mine. Not that a psychic is needed on this show; every character and their stinking poodles can see all of the ghosts just fine. The man that burnt his family alive in Murder House makes an occasional appearance so that he might kill someone else or try to woo Jessica Lange back into his life; generally these two actions are treated as being one and the same.<br /><br />The whole show is basically one long ramble of rapes, gapes, attacks, strobe lights, emotional breakdowns, histrionic fits, murders, ghosts acting more like perverse agoraphobes than ghosts, and inappropriate music selections (the Columbine kid is wandering around whistling Twisted Nerve while looking for fellow students to shoot about five years before the release of Kill Bill? Sure. And every damn time the camera is about to pan on to Dr. Frankenstein, they play the main theme from Bram Stoker's Dracula. There are other scores thrown in for good measure, including Psycho. Do the creators of this oozing cyst of a series honestly think that people will cheerfully exclaim \\"...wow, that's from Kill Bill! I know that song! I like that song, therefore I like the people that are turning my brain into a small lump of pumice with this shameless twaddle!\\" I can't think of any other reason they employed these notorious pieces of music).<br /><br />This show is as gross and thoughtless as a crack head fiending for a hit and just as desperate, willing to throw out any line that might lead you to handing over a few bucks. As if it's not vile enough to rip off about 20 infamous horror films, but they also have to throw in Richard Speck, The Black Dahlia, and Columbine? Gee, I can't wait for season two, where they drag out the entire plot of Saw, mash it up with Silence Of The Lambs, and then toss in Charlene Gallego and Aileen Wuornos having lesbian sex over the soundtrack from Xanadu for extra spice.<br /><br />Well, would you look at that?

B007L3BMGA|2.0|It would be an education to those who have lead a sheltered life and are interested in receiving an education on imaginative sex and S and M.  For those who have lead a more adventurous sex life, the novel may not have much appeal as the story line is thin and porn is generally boring.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Note to PC gamers:<br /><br />Wondering if you should go for this CPU or the Core i7-3770K? I'd recommend buying this Core i5 as it is a very nice processor.  Most new games are not utilizing HT technology and are GPU dependent.  The extra $100 USD you save by buying the 3570K over the 3770K can be invested in buying a decent graphics card (like the GTX 660ti or Radeon 7870).  The 3570K overclocks nicely and temps are decent (using a Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus).<br /><br />Other Specs:<br /><br />Motherboard: Biostar TZ77XE3<br />Memory: 8GB Cosair Vengeance<br />Graphics Card: EVGA Nvidia GTX 560 TI DS SuperClocked

B007J4T2G8|4.0|It was a very captivating book. Started out kind of slow for me, however it picked up and ended well.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Rush returns to their epic, story-telling style with Clockwork Angels.  Quick favorites were The Wreckers and Headlong Flight.  Once I saw the CA tour live, the song Clockwork Angels became a favorite, too.  And, The Garden is a beautiful, ethereal song.  Another great job by the guys!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I absoultely love the Outlander series.  I will say that this is not my favorite book of the series, and there were some slow moments in the book that I felt could of been edited out.  That being said, I still loved every minute of it and as soon as I read the last page, I immediately purchased The Fiery Cross on my Kindle and kept reading. This is by far the best series I have ever read!

B00004VVND|5.0|this movie is a classic , yet is still quite enjoyable 20 years later -- acting is great - suspense is there and this movie is a great escape
B004EPZ0AC|5.0|This was a fun movie to see and hear.  I was surprised at all the negative reviews, but perhaps a few wanted something simpler; and there seems to be someone with an agenda who is bringing down the overall results.<br />This movie, with all its various characters and journeys, could be used as a basis for discussions in classrooms.  And those classrooms could be from elementary school to college.<br />In addition to the philosophical points made in the movie I thought it was very funny.  And the music and visuals were great.  Give it a try.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book and am patiently waiting for the third book to come out on December 30th. This would be a great Christmas present.
030758836X|5.0|This book had such rave reviews that I had to read it! I actually downloaded it from the local Library and was so excited when it finally came available from there. It is written in the format of a diary by the main characters Nick and Amy (more so for Amy than Nick). For me it really didn't become super interesting until about 50 to 100 pages into the book.  I read a lot and have acquired so many books that I want to read that I do not like to waste time on books that are not keeping my interest. After it takes off though this book is amazing, bizarre and just plain creepy!!!! I am so glad that I did not stop reading and recommend this to anyone that wants to enjoy a truly different read. The basic story (of which I do not want to divulge too much of) is that Amy goes missing on Nick and Amy's anniversary. Like so many other books and real-to-life situations, the husband (Nick) automatically is suspected of murdering Amy. Once Nick figures out what really is happening...the story takes off and does not stop until you read the final page...and I recommend that you do read until the final page. I will be looking into other books by this author...
B008LSVL6U|5.0|Simply put, this is just awesome.  Typical Steve Wilson form.  I dare say it rivals the PT Blu-Ray release.  The music, video, style, form, presentation, set list.  It is just as good as it gets!  Wilson just keeps pushing his boundaries and developing evolving sounds and themes.<br /><br />What, you haven't bought it yet?!  Just give them your money!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I have tried three times to \\"get into\\" this book. Each time I have been unable to get any meaning out of the story line and just put it down in frustration.

B004EWEX9Y|1.0|I was given this item as a gift to use with a 4th gen iPod nano when traveling.  Cable would only produce sound no video.  So I used the wife's iPhone 4 and ipad 2 and same results.  Tried changing TV's.  Same results.  After calling Apple, they believe this cable may be either incorrectly made or bogus product.  Replaced it with a Amazon Basic's brand cable which worked as designed.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I read the first in this series after reading \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" by E.L.James. After reading that series, I was having a hard time finding something that grabbed and held my interest. A co-worker recommended this series so I thought I would give it a shot and ended up really enjoying it!! Reflected in You has been (so far) even better than the first book, \\"Bared to You\\". The story behind the \\"romance\\" is one of mystery and tragedy...I'm having a hard time putting it down!! I would definetly recommend this series!!

B0098VYCCE|5.0|My wife and I watched this movie one night as a secondary pick. It turned out to be a very good movie. We would recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was a great read that had you second guessing all the way through, and then you get to the end and feel like you've had a nice meal but no dessert.  It was like the author didn't know how to end the story.  I loved the story itself, but was left unsatisfied by the ending.
B000000OQY|4.0|It's funny to think that after Guns N'Roses' second official album Lies is basically a mesh up of the very first release before Appetite For Destruction, the 1986 independent \\"Live?!*@Like a Suicide\\" and four new songs added. Add to that a few of the songs on Lies are actually covers and they even cover one of their own songs and so much for \\"new\\" material. At the core of it this releases is two EPs in one (it clearly divides them too, under 1986 there's the live and under 1988 there's the acoustic listing) marketed as an album by Geffen records to cash in on the band's recent success seeing as they probably thought the band wouldn't be together for long (and it's hard to blame them).  Lies even uses a mockup cover of a tabloid with pictures of the band and titles of the songs along with \\"article\\" to make the whole thing even more crazy. It's not Appetite for Destruction, it's shorter, has covers, unreleased fake live material that's very raw (-er and cool) and it was just something to make the fans remain patient until the next Guns album. But you know what? Lies just plain work. It's not a stellar release, but it's a good one and it was interesting to have this raw Guns with sounds added to make it sound like a big live concert release and another side of acoustic songs. It brought a different side of the band, an interesting and enjoyable one.<br /><br />The four tracks from @Live like a Suicide begin Lies. Opener \\"Reckless Life\\" is known as one of the first song that the band played before there was even the G N'R name (dating from the Hollywood Rose days) and it's fast straightforward rock song. Their cover of Rose Tattoo's  \\"Nice Boys\\" is one that I really like, it's very energetic and of the four live tracks it's the one where Axl shines and sounds best. It's aggressive, fast paced and everything the band stood for back then. \\"Move to the City\\" has a cool groove and some sweet guitar work, it almost has a swing big band kind of feeling to it the way they play, the beat and how Axl sings.  The band is known for their affection for early Aerosmith and \\"Mama Kin\\" is a decent cover that very much follows up the original closely but it's the song from the first side that has the most energy and sounds the most Appetite-like.<br /><br />The next songs are generally considered the gravy of the album so to say. The first of four new songs (and only single), \\"Patience\\" is simply one of the best songs Guns have recorded, and perhaps that it's slower and acoustic with great lyrics helps. It also brings out another side of Guns N'Roses, one that I like very much. \\"Used To Love Her\\" is surprisingly calm and upbeat, almost a \\"it sounds happy but it's really not\\" song. It sounds upbeat and happy, but the twist it the lyrics are rather dark even if it ends up working rather well and it's a very good song.  \\"You're Crazy\\" is a slower acoustic take on the original tune on Appetite for Destruction and I actually prefer this version because it sounds more personal and has a very different feel. I really like the original but this one is special to me, although I love both versions. This was a great inclusion in this case, reworking a song worked. Then Lies closes with the controversial \\"One in a Million\\" which is actually not a bad song for argument's sake, but I just personally and like many others don't support the lyrical content and as a result don't find myself enjoying it so much. It seems like it was just Axl trying to be controversial for the sake of it, using Charles Manson, racial slurs, offensive words and talking about immigrants.<br /><br />So Lies is not an official studio album in a sense, but as an EP it works and hearing the raw \\"Live\\" material along with the new acoustic tracks is worth it. Definitely not the band's best release but one worth exploring certainly. For what it's worth, Lies is one of the best EPs I own and have listened to and sometimes EPs tend to be not as good as albums and in some cases, downright not worthwhile. I'll give Lies four stars.orthwhile. I'll give Lies four stars.

B007MDB71O|5.0|It has been a long time since a single movie has captured my imagination so completely as this film has.  It reminds me how I felt as a child watching Star Wars on the big screen for the first time.  It was a movie that I went to see in the theater several times, the same way that I did for Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It is a film that captures the old-fashioned adventures we all grew up and loved.  I only wish that more films went back to good old fashioned story telling the way that this film did.<br /><br />\\"A Princess of Mars\\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, the 100 year old novel that this film is adapted from, is the fictional travelogue of Captain John Carter, a Confederate soldier who prospects for gold in the American Southwest after the civil war. After an attack by Apaches, he is mysterious transported to the planet Mars. There on Barsoom, as the planet is known to the natives, he shows great physical prowess as the lighter gravity of the red planet allows him to leap about to the amazement of the four-armed, and tusked men known as Thark. His skills in battle become renown to all Barsoomians as he gradually battles his way to the top of their society. Driving John Carter to fight is his love for the beautiful princess, Dejah Thoris.<br /><br />The adaptation for \\"John Carter\\" has been updated for the modern audience.  Dejah Thoris is more than a princess, she is a scientist and a master swordswoman.  Lynn Collins is outstanding in portraying a woman who is every bit the equal of the hero in both action and character.  John Carter has undergone a change in the adaptation as well, he is a war weary man that has paid the ultimate price already, but through his love for the princess finds himself again. This gives the character more depth than the character had in the original novel and Taylor Kitsch put a new spin on this iconic role.  I loved William DeFoe as Tars Tarkas.  Although he had been turned into a nine foot, four armed green tusked man, the mannerisms and actions of the actor come through and this alien warrior becomes human in your eyes.  Most of the scenes that make the novel \\"A Princess of Mars\\" stand out are retained in the movie, but in a new and fresher way.  In particular the Warhoon battle is a beautifully filmed scene, both in action and in framing the personal dilemma that John Carter faces within himself.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this Blu-ray/DVD combo and was not disappointed.  The quality of the sound and video is excellent.  The behind the scenes extras were interesting and fun, giving the Blu-ray added value.  This is a film that belongs in the collection of anyone who enjoys action/adventure, science fiction or fantasy films.  It is sure to be known as a classic as the years go by.  My only disappointment is that as of this date, no sequel has been announced.  The original John Carter of Mars novels were a trilogy with more pulp excitement and thrills to come.  I know that the director, Andrew Stanton, had announced that he had started work on the screenplay for the sequel before the film was released in the theater.  My fondness hope is that Disney will realize what a great film this is and that it would be a good start to a new franchise of John Carter films.actions of the actor come through and this alien warrior becomes human in your eyes.

B007CBEO20|4.0|At times it can be hard to get past the notions of first impression and I think it's also applicable to music.  Sometimes it's the image of a group or artist or I can be that they are known for one song that isn't really their style but commercial enough so that it catches on and becomes their biggest hit. I believe that's the case with Swedish group Europe who are often lumped into a certain category, namely Glam Metal (sometimes called \\"Hair\\" Metal but let's not talk about hair follicles, let's keep it to the music shall we?). In the mid-late 1980's they were very successful with songs like \\"Rock The Night\\", \\"Cherokee\\", \\"Carrie\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\" and yes... THAT song. But those fun partying all night days with keyboards, ballads, hair, music videos of musicians playing in the fake live concert setting are over. While I still love those songs and the band still perform them live, Europe have successfully reinvented themselves with a string of consistently good albums since the 2000's and have a sound more akin to Classic Rock with some blues thrown in than the sound they are remembered for. The solos aren't over the top anymore and the keyboards are missing but the music is probably stronger for it (although maybe not as fun) and they can reach an audience that didn't like them initially.<br /><br />\\"Riches To Rags\\" is a very Zeppelin-esque riff oriented guitar opener and it's a fantastic all out rock song and the lyrics are terrific, a heavy hard driving song. To me it sounds like some Zeppelin with some Whitesnake thrown it almost, which is not bad at all. \\"Not Supposed To Sing The Blues\\" is not as aggressive but just as good, it's not as fast but still rocks and as the title implies it sounds somewhat bluesy, it's one of the best songs on BoB and sounds like mature AOR rock done to perfection, a modern classic rock track (much like the rest of the album actually).  \\"Requiem\\" is just a small instrumental piece that accompanies \\"My Woman, My Friend\\".  This song is on the softer sad as it is about I presume singer Joey Tempest's wife and it's a nice tribute to her and he pours his heart out on it. The title track, \\"Bag of Bones\\" is probably my favorite track of the album it has a great feel to it, the slow intro is sad, bluesy and delightful and then it kicks into high gear and it just plain rocks. Often the title track isn't close to be the best song on an album, but this one of them it just sounds deep and heartfelt, Joey Tempest shines through the emotion he displays in his voice here. \\"Mercy You, Mercy Me\\" is another song I quite like with its crunchy heavy riff a great modern Europe track. \\"Doghouse\\" in is similar vein, another balls out heavy tracks that just gets the listener rocking. \\"Bring It On Home\\" closes with some blues, experimental and Zeppelin-ish sounds and its one of my favorites for all of it, it ends the album very nicely and it adds diversity and color as well. Those are a few of the tracks that I enjoyed but really none of the songs are bad.<br /><br />I love the Europe album of the 1980's and they stayed with me; those albums are great to listen to and fun. However since making their true comeback with the Start From The Dark album in 2004, Europe has show amazing evolution and maturity and have done it quite well. In fact one could make the argument that those recent albums are better than their 80's output, if not it certainly gives it a run for its money and is probably better from an objective musical standpoint. Not everyone liked the Glam era but I think that with the sound they have continued to develop since their return, the bluesy Classic Rock vibe, has more appeal to those who didn't like Europe at first and it's a change that I approve of as a fan.<br /><br /> They aged with their fans and they aged well just like a fine wine, Bag of Bones didn't blow me away but it impressed me certainly it is a good, solid, consistent and pleasantly surprising album. You can make your pick for best comeback album as Europe released a string of consistently good album since 2004, I don't think Bag of Bones is the best one but it's another solid, pleasant album. Those who have stuck around will know what I'm talking about; those who haven't should re-discover Europe.  To me Bag of Bones is more enjoyable with each listen, it's one of those albums that is good from the start but grows on you. The reason I gave it a four stars? Well the songs are good, make up for a solid record but none of them really go to that next level of rock n roll where you crank up that song and go \\"That's the band I love!\\" . 4/5, it's a really enjoyable one.ck album as Europe released a string of consistently good album since 2004, I don't think Bag of Bones is the best one but it's another solid, pleasant album.

Lizbeth is framed for the murder of a journalist and his girlfirend who were going to expose sex trafficking. we learn more about her past and the shady characters in her life.

1451648537|5.0|The book is probably the most fascinating one that I have read about Steve Jobs or any technology guru. Jobs wasn't an easy person to work with but mostly because he despise mediocrity. He just wanted to create \\"insanely great products\\".<br /><br />There was no doubt Job was a great genius in the likes of Einstein, Walt Disney, etc. Apple is one of the world's most valuable companies - he saved it from the brink of bankruptcy when he came back to Apple. His second venture NeXT computer was instrumental in the development of the Web and the evolution of the Internet as we know it today. Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at CERN used a NeXT computer to develop the world's first web server software, CERN HTTPd, and also used to write the first web browser, WorldWideWeb. It was that NeXT computer that became the world's first web server on the Internet. The book goes into chapters where Jobs changed entire industries - music business, publishing, bookselling, phones, animation, computers, etc.<br /><br />Isaacson's book doesn't pander to any side, he is brutal in his honest retelling and at times you feel like Jobs was a jerk and at time like he was the greatest genius in the world - it is neutral overall but still shows what a great visionary, genius and perfectionist Job was. Like Walt Disney, he was a master innovator - taking products, ideas and turning them into masterpiece blends of technology and art. Humanity will always be indebted to him.<br /><br />His innovations were revolutionary - Mac, iPod, iPad, iPhone, NeXT and Pixar - the book give you in insight into the mind of the genuius, his whims, his life, his flaws, his friends, lovers and family as well.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|This book would probably be great had I not already seen the Dexter series on Showtime. The two are VERY similar. if you know what happens in the show, you will pretty much know what happens in the book. Also, I didn't find Dexter in the book to be as endearing as in the show. In the book, the character of Dexter is more one-dimensional. Michael C. Hall makes Dexter a very complex yet likeable character. In the book, Dexter is just cold and unrelateable. I probably won't read the next book in this series.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|Yes its true prog rock is alive and well.  Go ahead and make comparisons to Queen, Depeche Mode at least they are way above so much pop garbage out there.<br />Hope for this generation. Yes kids practicing your music is important.

B005D0RDKC|4.0|While Johnny Cash record sales waxed and waned over the years, he was always a draw in concert.  Live Around the World testifies why - no matter where he played or whom he played for, Cash had a magical ability to connect with an audience.<br /><br />The third volume in the ongoing Johnny Cash bootleg series, this is the first that really feels like a bootleg, that is, a collection of live tracks with less-than-stellar audio quality.  Despite the limitations of the format, there is much to enjoy in this set.<br /><br />Disc 1 offers up selections from four concerts: a 1956 performance at the Big D Jamboree in Dallas; a 1962 set from the New River Ranch in Maryland; a 1964 appearance at the Newport Folk Festival; and the famous 1969 concert for US troops in Vietnam, where Johnny was feverishly sick from the long travel.  Disc 2 shifts into the 1970s, offering up Cash's 1970 performance for President Nixon at the White House, three tracks from the 1972 prison album Pa Osteraker (recorded in Sweden), a 1973 version of City of New Orleans recorded at a Nashville industry event, a few tracks from 1976 recorded in Virginia and West Virginia, and finally a couple of songs recorded at the then-200-seat Exit/In club in Nashville.<br /><br />This release fills out Johnny's live discography nicely.  The Big D performances emphasize just how raw Cash's Sun records sessions were - apart from the low fidelity, these performances could easily substitute for his studio recordings of the time.  In the studio or live, it was just Johnny, Luther and Marshall, hammering out brilliant tune after tune.  By 1962, they were seasoned road warriors with drummer WS Holland added to their regiment.  Johnny's addiction to amphetamines is beginning to show, too: the band is rough and raucous, with Cash displaying his aggressive, impish sense of humour later seen on Folsom Prison.  At Newport, their sound is tamed as they play at a slower, quieter pace suitable for the festival's folkie audience.Of interest is Cash's praise for newcomer Bob Dylan, calling him \\"the best songwriter of the age since Pete Seeger.\\"<br /><br />The 1969 Vietnam performance is well-documented in Cash biographies, and his experience here would influence the later Talkin' Vietnam Blues.  To hear the actual concert is both satisfactory and disappointing.  The mix leaves a lot to be desired, particularly as Cash's voice is buried.  That said, he could barely speak he was so ill, so the very fact that he went on stage at all shows his commitment to his audience.  It's not surprising, then, that his approach is akin to his prison concerts - he's trying to lift up a group of men stuck in a place they'd like to escape.  He plays the wild ones - Cocaine Blues, Jackson - but closes up with the ever-wistful Daddy Sang Bass, reminding the troops of family, faith and home.  The highlight of the show, though, is Cash's wife June, who with a firecracker backing from the Tennessee Three absolutely tears up Long-Legged Guitar Pickin' Man.<br /><br />Disc Two is in line with Cash's more subdued output of the 70s.  The White House concert shows Cash to be both a hawk and a dove - one minute he is singing of old American ways (Lumberjack, Pickin' Time, Five Feet High) or good ol' American religion (the extended set of hymns), and the next he's ripping through a (humorously self-censored) Boy Named Sue, the politically confrontational What is Truth, and the religiously challenging Jesus was a Carpenter.<br /><br />The remainder of the disc shows Johnny growing comfortable through the seventies.  The Osteraker tracks, while well-played, lack the passion of the earlier prison albums, Folsom Prison and San Quentin.  His new songs tread familiar ground - One Piece at a Time is a comical talking blues in the vein of A Boy Named Sue; Billy Joe Shaver's I'm Just an Old Chunk of Coal is the sentimental gospel Cash returned to again and again in his career.  With piano and other instruments added, the old songs - Hey Porter, Give My Love to Rose - lack the one-two punch of his early sound.<br /><br />I find this to be the weakest of the Bootleg series thus, far.  The sound quality pales in comparison to other Cash live releases (surprisingly it's the later recordings that sound the worst).  The track-listing is too scattered, as well.  We're given four short sets on disc 1 (understandable, assuming many of them were taken from radio broadcasts of the day), but disc 2 falls apart.  Beginning with the solid, 40-minute White House set, they add 3 tracks from a recently reissued complete live album (Osteraker), and then throw in a track here and a track there from several different late 70's performances.  Complete sets, highlighting Johnny's audience interactions, work much better for Cash, and I wish we had all, not some of the White House performance.<br /><br />The upside to this set, however, is the opportunity to broaden Cash's live output.  He released 5 live albums between 1968-1972, so it's wonderful to hear how he sounded before and after (although half this package is still from that era).  The timeline of the set makes sense, as well, essentially covering his days with the Tennessee Two/Three from start to finish (Grant would be fired in 1980).  This is definitely not the place to start for live Johnny Cash (Folsom and San Quentin being two of the greatest live albums ever), but for a Cash lover, they're nice to have.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Admittedly, I bought this CD for the song Ho Hey, and then became crazy about the rest.  For the most part, the songs are fairly upbeat, ranging from the humorous (Submarines) to antiwar (Charlie Boy), with a few stopovers in between for a life lesson (Classy Girls) and an amusing love song (Dead Sea).  If I had any complaints at all, it would be about the order in which the songs are presented.  Why a dirge after the lovely Ho Hey?  They didn't just switch gears they slammed on the brakes.  I almost got whiplash!<br /><br />I do love my songs with a bit of substance.  This group has all that and more.<br /><br />My favorites are Ho Hey, Dead Sea, Flapper Girl, and Submarines.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book should become a movie.  It makes you feel what the characters are feeling.  If they are nervous then we feel nervous too.  I cant wait till the second book comes out.  There should be a second book.  It might be long but it is totally worth it.  Read the book with understanding, then you will be truly reading another Cinderella story.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the book, can't wait until the next one comes out. This series is a little more mature than 50 Shades of Gray to me, not so much high school love story kinda plot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game good to wast your time love love love love love love love love love love love
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|My son is 11 and he loves this series of Rick Riordan books.  I highly recommend this book for other parents seeking a series for their children in 4th - 8th grade.
B009FOBMBI|5.0|Now I am certainly biased as Three Days Grace is one of my favorite bands, but it's rare for me to find an album I can listen to from start to finish without skipping any tracks and this is one of them. It is definitely more electronically influenced than their previous albums but the lyrics are just as amazing as ever.
B005OKTPKC|4.0|I found the  story was fast pased and interesting. I truly enjoyed the the read,  or should I say 75% of it. As you read on you realise that it is starting to become familliar, you feel that the author is giving you less details and he is  preparing you for the end.  I would have liked if the author had developes the charcaters  some more and have the new found partnership solve some more cases.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|This is a good start to a great series. Once you read the first one, it holds on long enough to get you to read the rest. A great book for lovers of fantasy, mystery, and myth
B0068THAGY|4.0|Engaging movie with young teens in the lead, but it's not a silly Disney-type kid movie.  It's well acted, the story has depth, and it's interesting (even exciting sometimes).  Definitely worth a look.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I have a nine and ten year  who went crazy watching this trilogy. Very well priced for Blu ray but be careful if you plan to take it with you on trips since most portable video equipment are for dvd's only. Blu ray won't work on them. The reason why I'm sticking to Blu ray is that is more resistant to scratches and will continue to be available on my shelf for years to come.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|...I just couldnt stop reading!! Now I have to wait until Dec 31 for the next book. Entertaining, good read, enjoying the story.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|This album is a bit of a jump from his other stuff as far as sound goes, but I think he makes it work. Though I didn't at first like this album as much I did warm up to it. It is indeed a bit different, but one thing you CAN count on is it being extremely chill and honest, which is what Jack's always been about anyways. My favorite songs are \\"Turn Your Love\\", \\"From The Clouds\\", \\"No Good With Faces\\", and \\"Only the Ocean\\".
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|really good sound track<br />I just wish they had the movie version of the riff off instead of the studio version of it.<br />Other than that I really enjoyed the OST.
B009JNQ86Y|5.0|I had already heard the song lights, and liked it.  I went to purchase it on amazon and noticed she had a new album.  Since lights was also included on this new album, I decided to check it out first.  To be honest, I wasn't expecting much....but, I was blown away.  It's quite different from anything I've heard before.  Ellie Goulding has an absolutely amazing voice, and you really find that out on this new album, if you didn't already know.  I don't normally buy many albums, but there are just so many good songs on Halcyon, I had to buy it.  I also checked out the extra songs on the deluxe version, and they were all great.  So, I bought that version.  There really are some great songs on this album, especially Atlantis, Hanging On, Ritual, In my city, Without your love, and of course, Lights.<br />This is just the kind of album where you can lose yourself.  There's not much else to say.  Check it out.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good way to kill time waiting at appointments and picking my kids up from school. Would like to see more in the way of functioning with features of the phone.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I loved this album as a kid and love it even more now! Carole King  is such a soulful singer -songwriter,but she can also sing with power as in \\"I feel the the earth move\\".  I highly recommend this album!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|This was a ridiculous waste. I was really excited to use this calendar and added all kinds of events, bills, birthdays &amp; reminders. At first I really liked it, but couldn't get it to sync for anything &amp; the website was so confusing that I accidently changed something important (no idea what) &amp; everything ended up doubling! On top of that, I had to hunt down my timezone EVERY SINGLE ENTRY!! I then uninstalled the app &amp; reinstalled it &amp; it not only saved what I had input, but also doubled each entry again. I decided at this point to stick with my paper organizer until I can find something else.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I really liked this book because there was high action even at the beginning and throughout the story. I couldn't put the book down!!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and enjoyed the length of it too. I am probably going to re-read it again next week. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars was the continuous conversations about greek vs. roman, even with the monsters that didn't make these comments in previous books.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The crossfire novels are a great series.  The first book Bared to you was great but this book is so much better!!  I can't wait for the next book to come out in December.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|A friend recently turned me on to Mumford & Sons and I'm hooked. Their music is such a welcome relief from all the pop tunes out there (not that I don't appreciate those too sometimes). Trying to come up with a metaphor for this album, I compare it to a fine meal. Listening to this album, my soul feels as if I'm enjoying a meal prepared with love, spirit, amazing talent and skill. Twelve courses of hearty, delicious food accompanied by the perfect wine. I leave the table completely satisfied and happy!
B003IDMUX6|3.0|I found this to be an amusing, lightweight read. It is a bit far fetched in places but probably depicts well the dynamics that can exist between couples who have been together for a long time. The husband comes across as pragmatic in pursuit of a specific goal while his wife tends to be over emotional and subject to fears about what the neighbours think. The neighbours are a mad lot and their interaction with the couple is bizzare. It's a funny book and worth a read
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Oh my gosh such a great book could hardly put it down. the charators was excellent.the book is unbelieveable great great.its really giving fifty a run for its money.would recommend
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Awesome. Rick Riordan gave mythology a whole new level of awesomeness!!!!!!!¡!!!!!<br /><br />I just adore him, he made me decide my career!:)
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Unmistakably Rick Riordan, sense of humor and all, and like the title says, a page turner. So why's there a star missing, you ask?<br /><br />Because I can't shake the feeling that the book could be a touch tighter, perhaps a little less of the love-interest wouldn't have hurt. But hey, that's completely personal, and let me hasten to add that this doesn't make the plot any less interesting :o)<br /><br />Commenting further would require me to be a spoiler, so will leave off here. Happy reading!
B005KELW26|5.0|I'd recommend buying one of these.  Fortunately, I had a protective cover similar to this one on my generation I Kindle when it was dropped by a friend I loaned it to.  The cover saved the Kindle because without it the screen probably would have been broken.<br /><br />I like this cover even better than the other one I had because it has a strap with a magnet on it that keeps the cover closed.  The cover has a quality feel to it and I really like the color I chose (purple).  The combination of the Kindle Fire and this cover makes for a great reading experience.
1935251740|1.0|This book was a huge disapointment. The writing is pompous and amaturish, and the level of the arguments presented is surprisingly low, often employing circular logic and using fallacious argumentation (reductio ad absurdum and strawmen) to \\"undermine\\" current scientific paradigms. Lanza may be a well respected scientist in his field, but this is something I would have never guessed based on the quality of argumentation and writing of this book alone.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've wasted many hours with this app...and pretty much am ready to build my dream house and give the perfect gift to just about anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series of books.  They were recommended to me by my nephew and now I've turned it on to my grandkids and other friends children.  I highly recommend these books.
B007HJ84ZK|1.0|HBO you @&$%tards.  Shut up and take my money.  I've been paying AMC for every season of Walking Dead and Breaking Bad and GLADLY.  For all but 1st season of Breaking Bad which I bought the DVDs of, it's been through Amazon Instant watching them the day after they are aired.  I feel like the character in Pretty Woman who says I have all this money and they won't sell me anything.  I got this fistful of dollars and half a year later you still won't take it from me.  It's a big ol upraised middle finger to anyone who bought the 1st season, watched it, appreciated the product and waited with bated breath and a fistful of dollars to support the 2nd season... only to get the ol stiffarm.<br /><br />Generally speaking, I believe artists, actors, writers, directors etc do something useful and meaningful, something worth paying for (even a truly awful movie like Ink I would pay to check out as opposed to pirate), so I don't know that I'm ready to turn pirate now or ever, but there's a point at which I may just write off what I see as a bad business relationship.  There'll be a point at which I say boy that season 1 was great, wonder what happened to them, oh well nevermind time to watch the new Walking Dead and Breaking Bad episodes.  Yeah I got attached to the characters in Game of Thrones, wanted to know what happened to Tyrion, Arya, Snow... but at the end of the day, yknow what, they're fictional characters and if a bus didn't ever arrive on time, if my cellphone kept dropping calls, at the end of the day okay, I can move on and get invested in some other product.  Presumably season 2 would just get me more interested, attached, and frustrated by HBO.  I FOUND game of thrones via Amazon Instant and purchased it there.  Its availability online at all was the reason why I wanted to pay to see season 2, since I am not subscribing to 200+ channels of cable.  In the future, when I shop on Amazon, I will watch to see if a show I am considering purchasing is an HBO show to ensure that I do not hit the buy button and get stuck in a #%&^-tease type situation again.<br /><br />I can visualize the responses to my review based on AVAILABILITY of the product as opposed to the actual quality of the actual product.  So let's talk about the product.  It is a SERIES.  It's an ongoing story.  I rate things on Amazon based not on any artistic merit but on its value as a purchase on Amazon.<br /><br />So starting from that premise I'll tell you... the series is great.  Great production, interesting characters and so on.  I absolutely would love to continue paying to be told the tale in season 2 as I have done with some great AMC series - I use them as an example because they have some great shows and are doing the opposite of HBO.  Most importantly as I said, you are buying into a series here.  Your purchase of season 1 as opposed to the first one or two episodes means you've bought in for the entire story and I am sad to tell you that the story does not stop off at a satisfying point in season 1 but much as you might like to continue watching, HBO does not want your money to follow along with the story and will not let you pay them to continue telling it to you.  Not through Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, etc.  What you're therefore buying into, if you're buying this product, is the frustration of getting into the very beginning of a story, the characters, only to be told yes we have more, no you can't have any. That's the package experience so to speak being offered by HBO<br /><br />By contrast, AMC has some great selections and is actually interested in letting you pay for them and watch them if they exist.  Mad Men, Hell on Wheels, The Killing, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad... sadly you have to think of what company you're getting involved with prior to purchase.  With HBO or Showtime you may find that becoming a fan means the product exists, you want to buy it, but your money is no good with them.  The show is clearly tailored to play on your emotions such that you are on the edge of your seat for the next episode - normally this would be high praise for a show, but when you take into account what you KNOW they will do to you... had I known, I wouldn't have made the initial purchase.  There are other good shows out there.<br /><br />HBO's business model is to hold back their shows from availability on Amazon and elsewhere.  Therefore, if you watch the occasional cable show via Amazon, definitely reconsider your purchase of this or any HBO show.  If the show has run its course and is available here in its entirety, go for it.  If you subscribe to a cable package and plan to continue doing so, definitely consider watching Game of Thrones although you won't be purchasing it here on Amazon, you'll be going to HBO's on demand web page available only to those who subscribed to a cable package that includes HBO. Due to the absence of GoT season 2, I tried The Killing here on Amazon and found it to be quite gripping and entertaining.  Definitely shop around before you hit that buy button here on Amazon for any HBO show including Game of Thrones.  Sorry, but this frustration is part of what you're buying with your purchase of this product.
B005723JSQ|5.0|If you're in the mood to laugh, cringe at awkward moments, and get lost in the process of falling in love, this book is the one for you. It's an easy read that's delightfully predictable and full of unforeseen twists and turns that keep it interesting. I highly recommend this book and hope that you love it as much as I have. I'm not one to really re-read books, but I just might with this one.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I've been a Muse fan since Black Holes and Revelations, and I've come to expect more or less a level of excellence from their music.  The 2nd Law is quite different from Muse's traditional sound, but they've innovated in a good way to adapt and lure in new fans who have never heard the band before whilst maintaining the old ones.  Bellamy's vocals are still chilling and beautiful, and it is refreshing to hear Wolstenholme take the lead on a couple of tracks for what I believe is the first time. Howard, as always, provides a superior performance in percussion, especially with some of the fast-paced new sounds.<br /><br />Although I found the album to be spectacular, I can understand that traditional fans may not like the transition, especially if they aren't fond of the recent electronic movement in the music industry today. My suggestion would be to check out the tracks on YouTube or some free listening service first so as to sample everything.
0316228532|1.0|I'm having a hard time finishing this book. It's got quite a few swear words as well which really bothers me and it's kind of boring. Being a big Harry Potter fan, I find it hard to believe that the same author even wrote this book.
0425242099|5.0|Another amazing addition to the Psy-changeling series: Hawke and Sienna's story!<br /><br />(along with spies, cubs, delivering a psychic baby, explosions, hot wolf and cat people, mental weapons of the most dangerous kind, and Happily Ever Afters---several, in fact!)
B007SYWFRM|2.0|so this games starts free and fun...updates keep the game exciting ....then you get to the point that you need to spend real money to advance in the game...ok...then it begins to freeze the kindle....and then you can't advance any farther because updates aren't available and you cannot complete the tasks you are assigned to advance. after all of this you may find yourself...like me...frustrated while you still want to hang in there since you have invested...or should i say wasted....your time and money. overall not impressed.
B002N14GPE|4.0|The tension, suspension and thrills are almost unbearable. The twists and turns just keep coming and coming.<br /><br />The actors, especially Esther, delivered excellent and totally believeable performances. My only complaint was the dad...could he be any more clueless!?! You won't want to miss this one.
0756407125|5.0|Ok, so the reviews for this book seem to be somewhat scattered.  I rated this book as five stars because I think that it accomplished exactly what I expected it to...it continued and expanded on the story (or legend) of Kvothe from 'The Name of the Wind.' I couldn't put this book down.  It does have some faults, as others have pointed out, but they are minor and don't significantly detract from the great storytelling throughout the book.<br />  First of all, I would highly recommend reading 'The Name of the Wind' before reading this book.  You'll be glad you did.  This book picks up where the first one left off and encompasses the second day of storytelling from Kvothe regarding his past adventures. This book fulfilled all the promises of the first book.  From the moment I started reading, I was drawn into the world of Rothfuss.  The pacing and visuals throughout the story are well written. Rothfuss manages to create a lovable and believable world without being overly literary.<br />  I've seen several reviews in which people are complaining about the lack of progression in this story regarding The Chandrian.  While this is true and somewhat disappointing, I don't think that revealing too much regarding Kvothe's driving force was the purpose of this novel.  After all, it is only the second in the trilogy. The story contains plenty of new and fascinating adventures and people and continues to lay a foundation of who Kvothe is and how he built his legend. When you read this book, don't expect every loose end wrapped up from 'The Name of the Wind', but you'll still learn quite a bit about many of the characters from the first book.<br />  This book does contain a few random disappointments.  They are small and mentioned in quite a few other reviews, so I won't detail them here.  The final result to me is still the same.  This book is excellent.  I would highly recommend this book as well as the first in the series to any fantasy fans. Just make sure you have some timeset aside in the week ahead when you decide to buy it!
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I like this best, that the H/h hated each other at first meet, and it took a fair amount of time for them to get past appearances and impressions--<br /><br />Every part of the story was laid out with a great deal of care: the structure of the world, the primary characters, the backstory, all of it-<br /><br />The Master of Crows and his 'apprentice'/spy were evenly matched, and their conversations felt very real to me--kept me interested, and when I mean 'interested', I am so involved in the story that I Really Do Not Want to close the book At All.<br /><br />Gurn and Cael, the magefinder stinky dog brought depth to the story, and the trials and travels moved the whole thing along at a reasonable clip without sacrificing anything for this reader.<br />I am looking forward to checking out the author's other stories . . . .
B0001WTVUW|4.0|In 1983, the ABC television film, \\"The Day After,\\" was about a potential war between the Soviet Union and the United States. Both countries aimed nuclear weapons at each other and caused devastating destruction, massive loss of life, and suffering.<br /><br />This film was talked about and rightfully so about the possibility of Soviet Union-American relations at the time period and the potential to catastrophic devastation if nuclear missiles hit both countries.<br /><br />The message of this film is that nuclear weapons are bad for the entire population and the world in general. The first hour is the prelude to what would be the disaster with an all star cast like Jason Robards, John Cullum, John Lithgow, Steve Guttenberg, Jobeth Williams, Bibi Besch, Georgeann Johnson, and others to mention.<br /><br />Even after 30 years, this film can still pack a punch and affect you. The pictures of the destruction including the mass graves, sick and desperate people, and the human toll is unbelievable.<br /><br />After the missiles hit Kansas City and nearby Lawrence, Kansas, nothing is ever quite the same. The film may have been a television film but it was Oscar worthy for it's time for taking a stand against nuclear weapons.<br /><br />I deducted a star because there were no extra features regarding the film and also the price is pretty costly. Still, it's an epic worthy of notice.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I absolutely love my Supernatural season 7 collection! It has tons of great footage like the gag reel and deleted scenes. I pre-ordered it to watch before 8 premeired and it got here in just a few days! Definitely reccomend to Supernatural fans everywhere
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found myself reading this on every device I had just so I could fit a few pages in whenever I could.  Fantastic story!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|This album has catchy fun songs like pictures of people taking pictures and at or with me. I also like the case; not a normal jewel case, and nice art work on it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really exciting. Very awesome game.  Lets play Peps world it disband awesome game to play. It is funny.
B004GYY714|4.0|this is a great app I use it all the time on my ipod so now that i have a smart phone i got it on that too. i should do the upgrade but havent yet. has radio, sports, books, podcasts, most of the stuff you want. i love it.
B009B50QOU|4.0|great sound cant wait for dos, might try to see them in denver. I think the hole ep is great.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I'm embarrassed to admit I'm reading it, ha.  But I can't put it down.  Another reviewer put it well...  not the best written but it's like 'literary crack'.  Therefore, it's been a fun read and worth the time.  It' s clear that the author copied the plot from the Twilight books, however.  I am disappointed that it is soooo similar except for the sex!  I knew it was a sexually graphic book before I started reading but I wasn't fully prepared for the world of BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Dominance/submission, and Sadomasochism) so one must be open to the exploration or it may be offensive to you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|well when I have minecraft on my ipod, ipad, iphone, xbox, Pc and now this. minecraft is a very fun game. it would be great if you can add armour into the game because we need to protect ourselves from creeper!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was amazingly written... fast read... couldn't put it down... very much looking forward to the story told via Travis... :)
B008JH5CVS|2.0|This movie was a good idea, unfortunately the script was poorly written, the directing wasn't good at all, and some of the special effects weren't even given any attention.<br /><br />It's not worth owning, and after seeing the movie I wasn't that thrilled with having paid $3.99 for it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This marks my first ever book review. I read quite a bit with a wide range of tastes but my favorite is Sci-Fi. I am a firm believer that \\"good\\" books or \\"bad\\" books is a relative term to the reader. Thus, I have always refrained from writing a review simply because what I may like, someone else may not or vice versa; so why should I let my opinion affect someones decision to read what could potentially be the best book THEY have ever read?<br /><br />What's different now, you might ask. Simply put, this is one of the best books I've read in quite a long time. To put that in perspective, I've read 5 books in the last 10 days; and not small ones. On to the review...<br /><br />Firstly, I'm not done with it so this may give you some idea of how good this book is. It has technology (most of which is beyond me but I have an imagination), it has humor, it has despair, it has crisis; just about everything you want in a good sci-fi book. Yes, it even has the f-bomb in it.<br /><br />--- A side note for those who had a problem with the authors repetitive use of the f-word. GET OVER IT! I have often wondered why many authors shy away from profanity in their writings. It has always been my opinion that the dialogue in most books is the worst part of the writing simply because of the lack luster and non-believable dialogue they use. People curse, many curse a lot. I know I do and I consider myself fairly well educated. I interact with attorneys, doctors, and mathematicians and guess what? They curse too. Some of them worse then my old Marine buddies. Real people don't always say \\"darn\\" or \\"damn\\" - some of us say \\"F888\\" and real loud too. So again, GET OVER IT or go read the bible.<br /><br />Back to the book. In reality, I can't say enough good about it. For .99 it is well worth it for a staunch Sci-Fi fan and even those that aren't. It has heart. Pick it up...
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First off- Thanks so much to all who are,will,and have served! Your committment and dedication to preserving our freedoms is unquestionable and beyond reproach. Above all let us never forget those that have paid the ultimate price.Their service and our repect for their sacrifices must be protected at all costs.<br />Thanks to Mark Owen for telling this story. It needed to be told by someone who was there. It's well written and I certainly don't understand all the media hype centered on revealing classified information on means,methods or operations. Everyone should read this account and come away with a new perspective on the risks our troops and operators face every single day that is \\"all in a day's work\\" for them. As much as \\"who really did the job\\"!<br />Keep taking out the Trash!!!<br />PJJOLLY55<br />USAF-VN Vet<br />68-74
0553801473|4.0|I liked how this fifth book was a compilation of a different viewpoint from the characters and a continuation of the story from all points of view after. With all that being said it really didn't serve to move the story along.  There seemed to be a great deal of filler information throughout with the overabundance of narrative description of clothing, scenery, and food.<br /><br />There were still some parts of the book that I had trouble getting through, mainly Aisha Greyjoy, Quentyn and Davos.  Another thing I did not like about this book is that new points of views keep popping up from various characters.  It's like the Greek Mythology Hydra in writing; Martin is cutting off one head when a million more sprout up.<br /><br />Martin does an amazing job of dealing with the realities of war and the aftermath it causes.  Also, the political stratosphere and how one mistake or decision can change the course of everything.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|No plot, no acting, bad renditions of favorite songs...........YUCK!  Lots of quality folks with no where to go.........shame on Adam Shankman!
0307719219|5.0|As I write this review, it's been some months since the debt crisis in the Euro zone - Portugal, Spain, Greece - were on the front pages of all the newspapers. Today, every country in the world is interconnected through finance - basically wealthy countries (or should I say wealthy-on-paper countries) lend money to poor countries, and receive a return on their investment in these poor countries when those countries repay the loans with interest. Of course if the country in question doesn't repay the loan (otherwise known as \\"debt forgiveness\\"), the wealthy-on-paper country writes off the debt and taxes its own citizens a bit more to recoup the loss.<br /><br />How long can *that* go on? The current US government seems to think it can continue to go on indefinitely - It's all play money, shifted around from ledger to ledger, with more printed as needed.<br /><br />But it's all going to come crashing down, sooner or later.<br /><br />Which brings me to this book, Why Nations Fail, a fascinating history of the world in the context of nation building. We know everything that this author says in this book (by \\"we\\" I mean those who keep up on this type of thing, such as our own government) and yet our own government people can't, or perhaps won't, learn from their own mistakes as well as the mistakes of others, and we continue on the path to oblivion.<br /><br />We are part of our nation...every nation is part of the world ... we need to know what's presented in this book. We need to learn from it - even if we disagree with conclusions drawn - and we need to right the ship before it inevitably capsizes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Wow! Just wow!  If you read the other books in the series, deffinitly pick thisone up!  Its was great!  It`s so cool to see how much the characters have grown, and we literally grow with them!  You learn so much from these books and dont even realize it!  In LA the other day we were learning about Icarus and Deadalus, and I was all,\\"oh yeah baby! I know this one!\\"  NOTE!!! Do not, under any circumstances, read this book if you have not read the rest, your mind WILL explode.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|Let me start by saying I am probably a bigger fan of McCartney and the Beatles then most of you.<br />So, Sir Paul has gone down that nasty road of trying to be a Crooner! Sorry Paul, this just does not work for you. I mean come on, who took the roll out of rock and changed the face of music forever? Most of us who were weened on the Beatles also grew up with great bands like Zeppelin,Floyd,The Stones,The Who, etc etc--. Point is that this new CD is the music that my parents listened to and I an 53! If you insist on still putting out music then maybe you should get back to  your creative juices from the Abbey Road days! Or how bout Paul, listen to an Ian Hunter album! That guy is 72 and still can rock and write  great songs.
B0092SPYQG|5.0|This cd is great! P.Roach has out done themselves again! My favorite is \\"Not that Beautiful\\" and \\"Still Swinging\\" !!!
B005LAJ1HW|5.0|I love this series, and having a set that includes Blu-Ray, DVD, AND digital copies is an even better deal at this price.<br /><br />Packaged well, delivered quickly, I highly recommend this product.

Some people who have reviewed this only looked at the coin buy screen and came here to give rather biased reviews.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This was a great follow up to bared to you!  I Can't wait until the next one!  I love this series even better than 50 shades.  Read it 3 times and love it more each time!
0345803507|5.0|It takes a lot for me to find a book interesting and the Fifty Shades Trilogy is just that interesting but also absolutely AMAZING. It has been a long time since I have found a book so captivating and this book is just that. I read the entire trilogy and less than two weeks and found myself wanting more at the end. This book lives up to all the hype and yes it is what they call \\"soft porn\\" in a book and yes the detail is mind blowing but it isn't just about the sex. This book is a story of love between Anastasia and Christian and their love is real and full of all the ups and downs of a relationship. It is passionate and erotic. He makes you mad, she makes you mad and you honestly feel like you are living their lives. I would recommend this book to anyone and in fact have my whole work place reading it :) Please take a chance on this book and I promise you that you will fall in love with it and wish you had a Christian Grey of your own :)
B0089AD8IO|3.0|Don't let this fool you. This item is the new 'cheap/basic' packaging. I was expecting the actual container to be of the Tardis and fold out to show the interior of the Tardis. (Like what you find on the other Amazon listing for the same product.) I was also expecting a paper episode guide that this did not have. I blame myself for not researching more, but I'm still disappointed. It's simple like any other DVD case you would get with a regular movie, except the inside has slots for five discs. Needless to say I'm bummed out. But I guess that's what I get for buying it for only $23.00.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is awesome!!! I wish I didn't have to wait so long for the next one. Definitely could not put it down. My opinion The Crossfire novels are more enjoying to read than Fifty Shades....
B008673ZAQ|5.0|She's done it again! I felt like I was holding my breath the entire time I was reading. I felt like I was on an emotional roller coaster and I didn't want to get off the ride. I felt like I could feel everything Eva felt, every high and every low. Can't wait for the next ride!

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really liked this game this. game was another big fish winner.  please keep them coming.<br />big fish did it again.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved it, when I was 7or 6 i always looked forward to watching this movie on cartoon network. It is even better in story form. It really brings me back to the good ol' days.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This has to be one of the best, if not the best disney animation ever created. The story is delightful, the graphics and effects are so beautiful and appealing, and the Blu-ray tranfer practically took my breath away. I kept playing the very first scene over and over again, and it has some of the greatest music I have EVER heard! Such a touching fairytale, please give it a try. Thank you for reading.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I found it is waterproof and protects really well but it is extremely hard to hear from. And the car charger doesn't fit with this cover. You have to take it off to charge it. Otherwise it's great!
B008KRJWEK|4.0|ohh..mann this game is really awesome .. I am getting addicted to it. really a nice game play. I wish they provide several other options to modify the car.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I fell in love with Travis ....this book toke romance to another level...I'll be reading it over and over .
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the second book of the Crossfire series.  So much drama and so much excitement!  I can't wait until the third one comes out at the end of December!  I highly reccomend this book and if you are a 50 Shades fan this is a must read :)

B004UID2LC|1.0|Don't download this. Ive downloaded several videos and it seemed to work fine...until I realised I was only able to watch 1/4 of my video. and now when I watch a video on the browser this junk pops up asking me if I want to download it on this. I also cant watch videos more than 8 minutes long.
B00846REIS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and it was hard putting it down.  I saw it by the 50 shades of grey section, and it looked good to read.  I liked it even better than 50, it's not as kinky and I think the characters are more \\"real\\" and developed more.  I am really looking forward to the third book and already have it on preorder.  I am excited to see where things go with them.
1592332803|1.0|This book is just like any other baking book, only every time it would say eggs it says Ener-G Egg replacer, every time it would say milk it says non-dairy milk replacement, and every time it would say butter it says non-dairy butter. So buy a regular baking book for less or if you can find a good vegan baking book that has flour substitutions or any ingenuity at all please tell me.
B002RL7W9W|5.0|Even though I enjoy Lego brand building sets myself, I bought this one for my grandson.  He loves Star Wars and Legos.  Not only are Legos fun, they develop eye/hand cordination, and in older builders, the appreciation of detail and precision.  In my opinion, the quality of Legos cannot be beat, from the packaging, the instruction manuals, to all the intricate pieces, however, I do think they are a bit over-priced.  Nothing wrong with my order.  Package arrived within set time, in perfect condition.  Supplier through Amazon gets high marks.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|the book is great. a true classic. i picked it up at a used bookshop for two bucks. some books you just need on your shelf. i wanted a copy for my kindle for when im not at home.  but can anyone explain to me why is the hardcopy of the book cheaper on amazon than the digital copy?
0385360185|2.0|Reading several reviews of the Fifty Shades Trilogy leaves little else to write.  The books do make the reader identify with characters.  That is an author talent.  I give the books an A.  The plot is good regarding the protagonists and antagonists, but weren't threaded correctly.  I give the books a B.  The constant repetitions were over the top and used as fillers to make a fatter book.  The books get an F for that.  The books had great promise if the chords of the plot would have been woven together.  An example is the third book car crash of Anastasia's step father.  Christian could have understood a child's unconditional love of a parent if the author would have tied it together.  Many of the clipped seemingly untied connections could have been woven into the plot.<br />The sexting, sex emails, and fights with the \\"goddess\\", \\"oh my\\", and \\"hot\\" and the constant orgasm other readers complained about as repetitious.  I also found annoying.  If I had to read one more email with time, date, regarding, sex innuendo, and signature I would have vomited into the potted plants.  My jaw dropped to the floor when I read that since 1994 bestiality and sadism are legal between consenting adults, and no longer considered to be mental illness.  Does this prove our society is once again, as a friend put it, Sodom and Gomorrah?  I do find it disturbing that people buy into marketing and advertising this deeply.  The book isn't really a book worthy of a top ten best seller list.  Most books on the top ten best seller lists are not.  This is strictly a gullible public falling for media spin.  Isn't it interesting that the British seem to market their authors so well?  The American authors are the same, same, same, same with little changes in the top ten best sellers.  It makes me appreciate self published authors a lot more.  At least a significantly talented self published author produces a great read occasionally.  It is a shame some really good authors are bypassed because there is no media spin to bring them into the open and market them.  Like everything in this sad world we live in, it isn't who you are, it is who you know.<br />I also believe that this book reinforces an increasingly narcissist and sick society.  Sex and lust are simply not the basis of a sound and healthy relationship.  This book is definitely sending misguided signals to the group of young people it is marketed for.  A man does not fall in love with the woman who provides good sex.  A woman does not fall in love with a man who provides orgasm.  It is just good lust and nothing more.  A relationship based on lust is a relationship that is doomed to fail in reality.  This book contains no interaction of communication for a solid and healthy relationship.  Anastasia Steele takes no interest in her lover's skills as a CEO.  Christian Grey takes no interest in his lover's talents in book editing and running a publishing house.  There is a dark side to all of us.  What makes us a good society is the control and accountability of that dark side.  It seems today that we feel free to unleash it, if books like these are on the top ten best seller lists.  Recognizing the dark side is healthy, but once unleashed without accountability can only cause utter destruction of the society.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007JTG4KK Bear River Spirit]]e is no media spin to bring them into the open and market them.

B003O86FMW|5.0|my favorite book ever. susan collins did a fantastic job writing this sequel. i have never read a series with an out standing first book and a second one just as good or better.
1423140591|5.0|By far my favorite book in the entire series. But please, people who read books out of order?<br />And then complain that it's uninteresting or makes no sense? STOP IT!<br /><br />Go read the Percy Jackson series first! :D
B0053Q9DHW|1.0|I am disappointed as I am unable to watch either of these DVDs because they are restricted for viewing in Zone 1, which is America and Canada. Please replace with DVDs that I can view in Europe.
B007XELMO4|5.0|Excellent product. Great for travel, hiking and anytime you want quick access to your camera. Keeps the camera secure for active people.
B008H29YVY|5.0|Many Wagner fans may find Solti or certain cast members to be weak in a few opera; however, when it is good, it is really breathtaking. These recordings are a testament to the quality of the Solti-Decca collaboration over four decades.<br /><br />I've seen many people ask on different forums if these recordings have been newly remastered. The Ring recordings appear to be the 1997 remasters. The other recordings seem to be the 2002 remastering (96 kHz/24-bits), which I had a difficult time finding in brick-and-mortar stores 10 years ago.<br /><br />If you are (1) a Solti fan or (2) missing at least three of the opera in this set, I highly recommend this purchase. The only downside to this budget set is that there are no physical libretti. A 37th disc contains PDFs of the libretti. Personally, this poses no issue for me since I can always refer to the libretti that came with my LPs.
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I would definitely consider myself to be a deadmau5 fan, but just below that of a mau5head, so perhaps a more expert review is fitting.  Like the other reviewers, I saw a big change in the first two/thirds of the album from the last third.  His latter stuff is experimenting with slower \\"story telling\\" vibes, which is interesting, but wasn't really for me.  This is indeed worth it for \\"Their Might be coffee\\" and \\"The Veldt\\" and many of his other tracks are good as well.
B0027MJU00|3.0|This book is disturbing, but it held my interest.  It is like all of Gillian Flynn's books -- it involves a troubled protagonist who is trying to learn the truth about her past.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I haven't played this much but when I did it worked well and was fun.  It is definitely worth downloading for free!
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Nice app. Easily customized and works as promised. Really like being able to mix the sounds and adjust the respective volume individually. Ads can be obtrusive and their content a bit more &quot;risque&quot; than PG.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|As always, this was a very well written and flowing story by Mr. Riordan. I very much enjoy the mix of Greek and Roman characters that this series. This was, as always, a page turner that was difficult for me to put down. I am looking forward to the next edition of this series. Keep up the good work Rick.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great price for the luxury of not having to track down each of the titles and drive to who knows where to get them since the library only has limited copies.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I hate sports movies, especially fight and boxing movies, almost as much as I detest biopics and films about artists. But this is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.....loved it!  Cheryl's insight on her life, coupled with the experience of hiking the trail....great reading!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the third and final book.  I love that Katniss and Peta finally get back together.  I loved the part where Katniss kills Coin too.  I was totally expecting that.  My son who is 8 likes reading the series with me too. i catch him reading over my shoulder sitting on the couch next to me.  I would recommend this book to my friends.
B0092QITO2|1.0|I went to see this movie purely because of the Philip K. Dick connection, unfortunately apart from the loose idea of someone having a memory erasion there is no Philip K. Dick here. PKD was a master of story weaving, of character forming, of plot building. What we have here is no story, cardboard characters and a plot that a 6 year old could have put together in 2 minutes. It's basically over 2 hours (my god is it long) of chasing and shooting - that's it ! nothing more ! I was unable to leave the cinema as I was with someone but I so wanted to do so. The Producer is largely to blame, although he was probably just doing as the film company requested i.e.: making some easy money. Everything about this film is awful, from the overbearing music to the casting. I wouldn't blame Colin Farrell too much as his acting is okay and he wasn't to know what a turkey he was getting involved in, although good actors would think very seriously before doing a remake. Kate Beckinsale is probably one of the worst things about this film, I've nothing against her, she's a fine actress when playing the right part but this is clearly not the right part - has there ever been a worse case of miscasting in cinema history ? She struts around supposedly tough and scary (I don't think so), her voice is irritating, her presence is annoying and her fighting scenes are cringe-worthy. There is absolutely nothing original in this film; The Terminator, The Matrix, Bond, Batman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - the plagiarisms are all too evident. And the sets have been copied from a movie made 30 years ago (Bladerunner). I'm tempted to call this film pointless but of course it's not. Occasionally films are made for art's sake, for the love of producing something worthwhile, often it's purely about making money - and this is the point of this film. What's so sad for me is that the name of Philip K. Dick is associated with this garbage. I'm pretty sure that if the great man were alive today his lawyerswould have made damn sure that his name was not associated with this film in any way, shape or form whatsoever. If you are a PKD fan don't watch this. If you are not a PKD fan don't watch it either - unless 2 hours of noisy shoot 'em up trash is what you like in a movie.
B008Y6YLBG|1.0|Nothing happens in this movie.  You keep hoping that the plot is building up to something intriguing, but it never does.  If you like the book Ethan Frome, you'll probably enjoy this movie.  But if you like stories where there are twists, action, mystery, or surprises, don't waste your time.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Angry Birds is cute and amusing.  A fun challenge, but not very exciting.  Works great when winding down after a busy day.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|This book is incredible, easy to read and motivational.  The stories are interesting and engaging.  It's tough to put down and easy to pick up.  It's motivated me to stop smoking after 25 yr.
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|I have recently seen this film at the cinema and it is superb. As the title suggests, it's about birth, life, and death. A collection of images from around the world set alongside an excellent musical soundtrack. The images you see are wonderfully shot and varied: some beautiful, some imaginative, some shocking, all are thought provoking. Images such as: Buddhists and Buddhist Temples, scenes of the natural world, tribes from remote corners of the world (highlighting the contrasts of lives in the world today), a muscular tattooed man tenderly holding a baby, mass consumerism in the West, technology, fascinating images of people's faces (some not quite what they first seem), and some truths about the food industry that every human being should see. I could list hundreds but better just to let you watch the film. When the film ended at the cinema the audience stayed glued to their seats, unable to move as they tried to take in and come to terms with what they had just experienced. In an industry that nowadays seems largely to be about making as much money as possible by churning out shallow trash, how refreshing to have people like Fricke, doing it for the love of art, for the love of producing something worthwhile. I would say the best place to see Samsara is at the cinema but if you missed the opportunity then the next best thing would be to watch it on a large sized plasma/LCD screen with a good speaker set up. And on this occasion it's worth paying out the extra and getting it on blue-ray. Then get yourself comfortable, sit back, and enjoy a fantastic sensory experience.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I really liked this app. I've been playing one like it and really liked the graphics and ease of play. The only problem I have is apparently my screen is too small. I can't touch the buttons at the button of the screens that pop up.<br />I had to uninstall, but I've really like to get to play again. This time with screens that for my phone.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very good app, runs well on my Epic 4G, also very addicitive. highly reccomend if you like this type of game!
B008476HBM|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!  Classic romance novel.  Had wanted to read this for a long, long time.  Moderate amount of 'flowery' writing, but I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Definitely enjoyable by adults also. Not just a young adult book. Out of the 8 Percy Jackson books this is my favorite so far. Rick Riordan just gets better and better
B004VMUS9G|5.0|it makes me wake up faster you can set more than one alarm I do not over sleep now since I have a alarm

B003Y3ZTGA|5.0|I used to be a closet Katy fan...until this album. There isn't a bad song on here! Pearl is an uplifting song that will help lift any woman's spirit reminding her of how incredible she is.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game reminds me of all those hours I spent as a kid at the fair playing this type of game. Love it! I have earned all the specials and have over 5000 coins in the pot. I did not spend a dime on this app. It is not a money app at all. It just takes time and skill.
B0011Z5IXC|5.0|This is a great album if you don't already own any other Led Zeppelin albums and want a good starting point with many of their best songs.

B002N44XSG|5.0|I thought this was a good read and enjoyable to those who had read the series! Really well done, i loved it!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|I rented this thankfully so not a whole lot was wasted but my time. Me and my kids watched this together one night and even my kids 11 and 9 year old girls were bored to tears.  This movie lacks all substance and if your looking for a real plot look elsewhere.  Huge waste of time, want to watch a fun fantasy movie go back to Princess Bride or the newer Stardust but whatever you do skip this!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Why must we wait another whole year!? I cant wait for the next one, this one answers so many questions and leaves you begging for more.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this book! Don't get me wrong, the first one was great but this one is better! The story gets a lot more personal and you find out more about the characters.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought this series was better than the Fifty Shades of Grey books...more substance & a better story line. I'm  eagerly awaiting the third book in the trilogy!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Superb writing and strong characters. l have an affinity for those stories placed in WWII that feel as authentic as this one. The unfolding of all the secrets  is as deliberate and delicate as the slow stripping of an artichoke.<br />     Writing reviews is not one of my inclinations, but this jewel deserves the praise.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I did not read the first book simply because I had no idea it was a trilogy.  I was disappointed in the path this book took.  In many ways, it mimicked Fifty Shades; rich powerful boyfriend with significant childhood issues and control issues.  Eva and Gideon had safe words and the sex is described as rough and painful (not romantic).  It is difficult to perceive Eva and Gideon as a couple because the relationship lacks romance and a lot of focus is put on Eva's life outside of Gideon (best friend, mom, dad, co-workers, rock star, etc).  Eva and Gideon's relationship had no cohesiveness (like the direction of this book) and I did not care whether they got together in the end or not.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Way better than Fifty Shades trilogy, I'm in love with the characters and love Sylvia Day. Can't wait for the next segment.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|It is a very good product, I deff like the fact that it is very secure in the case and will not fall out, also I like the stand comes in handy when you just want to prop it up and watch a video or two...
B00742BVW8|5.0|GREAT movie! LOVE the color symbolism! A MUST see!!! This was my first official Jet Li movie and I thought it was awesome :)
B00914JWSW|5.0|This CD will re-ignite the \\"old\\" Barbra/ \\"new\\" Barbra debate--if it had ever died down. In my view it's meaningless, anyway.<br /><br />I am a long-time listener (since 1969) who has seen her live in Timeless and Live 2006 and will do so again 10/26 at the United Center--I can probably identify any of her recorded songs (and the album it is on) and her voice in general within 2 or 3 notes. I am of the view that there is only one Barbra.<br /><br />Her almost unbelievable \\"run\\" (50+ years) is due, I think, to her constant willingness to change and explore and deal with what is real, even if the latter includes changes in her still phenomenal and totally unique voice. The products of this willingness are sometimes completely sublime (am I the only person who loves Classical Barbra?) and sometimes totally awful (Don't Believe What You Read from Streisand Superman and the overwrought/overdone and musically ridiculous medley at the end of A Star is Born are two examples of clinkers). BUT mostly the results have been great, as the fact that she's had #1 albums in each of the last five decades proves.<br /><br />As usual, the best cuts here are the show tunes--Home and Being Good Isn't Good Enough. The \\"Irish\\" medley is off--I think hearing a Brooklyn girl sing about \\"laddies\\" is the problem. The other cuts are very good (Willow, Weep for Me) to great (Didn't We), with the exception of Mother and Child (should have been left in the vault) and maybe the country song (not her best genre). The die hard Funny Girl-ites are missing out on the mature Babs as shown in the Bergman song.<br /><br />There is only one Barbra, and \\"being good\\" hasn't ever been good enough for her--she is the best.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Ii hope you are ready for an action packed, nail biting book that you cant put down! This book is an easy read for any military personnel with a deployment under their belt. Those who have never served dont worry, you werent left out, everything was described in great detail. Read a chapter and you could literally close your eyes and watch the movie play out in your head! Absolutely amazing breakdown of the events that led up to the death of Geronimo. Be prepared to not do anything but read for a few hours as this gripping story unfolds in your lap as if you were right there next to some of the most senior SEALS in the business at the time. Have fun and enjoy!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading \\"Bared to You\\" the first Crossfire novel I couldn't wait for the sequel to be published and immediately preordered it. The continuing story of Gideon and Eva left me wanting more and now can't wait for the next book to come out which will be the conclusion to their compelling love story. If you enjoy sensual romance this series will not disappoint.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Gideon (Crossfire series) or Aiden...why would Sylvia Day use the same last name (Cross) for two different book series hero????  I was confused when reading this one since I had just read about Gideon... The sex in this book is much more explicit, but without the tie'm up and wack wack of the other series.  But, then again the plot is pretty much the same in both of these two series, each has a fantasy angle...albeit one is in another dimension.  A good read, pretty much as expected.  That's why three stars...can't get over that name thing...
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|its a gd game.  coins just go too fast. also too many puzzle pieces to move on. should b only 5 or 6 to move on.  maybe less.

0525952926|5.0|This, the second in the three book series by master, Ken Follett exceeded my expectations by a wide margin.  His remarkable ability to weave interesting stories featuring unique characters into an historic backdrop is unparalleled.  I can't wait for the third and final book in the sequence, I only hope it is over 1,000 pages!<br /><br />An Avid Follett Reader,<br /><br />Ben
B002MFV2IK|5.0|Rarely do you see this caliber of actors attack totally off-the-wall, darkly humorous roles such as these and provide an enormously fun frolick at the same time! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it brings me to tears of laughter every single time I watch it! I don't care what \\"professional\\" movie critics give this movie...it's FIRST RATE in my book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great second book in this series! Well written and an easy read. I read this book in four hours! Can't wait for the next book!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love Reflected in YOU... Anyone who asks me for recommendations for a \\"50 Shades\\" kinda book, I immediately recommend this series! Better written than 50 shades (sorry Christian Grey fans)... Enjoy the push and pull relationship of Eva and Gideon. can't wait for the third book!
B009CG29RK|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son who just turned 2. It is his favorite movie. Lucky for me the movie is very good because he watches it every car trip so I can almost recite every word from the movie. I would recommend this movie to any one. Very nice family movie.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As a big Rick Riordan fan I find it hard to see the wrong things with his books. For the Mark of Athena it was easier, you could tell Riordan was rushing through it and this is perfectly understandable. He's now working with four narrators instead of one and so he has to spend more time on what they're doing but still move the plot along. While it could be better, Riordan still delivers a compelling story that will leave readers screaming in rage once they finish and have to wait a year for the next installment.
0446580848|5.0|Bravo!<br /><br />Mr Demille has written-another hit best seller<br />Another superlative piece of work<br />Mr Demile's storytelling is compelling, crisp and spellbinding and his latest-<br />The Panther - kept me reading all night<br />A real page turner that I couldn't leave - thrilling and riveting<br /><br />And as usual I will read it again to discover Demille nuances that are found following successive serial reads<br /><br />Highly recommend<br /><br />Encore please!
B006YXTRHY|3.0|Interesting film, unfortunately a lot of it focused on Stewart's vacuous stare and wooden acting.  Can she do a film without that blank, open-mouthed face? Please let her career be over. Was hoping it would be better than it was, she just keeps getting worse. Thought it would have the evil vampires in it, they made it fun.
144937980X|4.0|I read this book fairly quickly, and it provides a very good basic understanding of the processing language.  I know it was the right place to start with no experiance, but I really wished it had more information on the link between processing and the Arduino IDE.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|While the 28 days later opening hospital ripoff was disappointing, overall The Walking Dead is a dandy zombie show. The zombies are scary, gruesome, and a little tragic. I really liked that they were somewhat sympathetic and pitiable, with just a touch of confused humanity--as well as horrifying & terrifying, especially in a mob.<br /><br />The human characters are mostly complex & interesting, and not complete idiots (stupid decisions are an infuriating monster movie convention & while some bad choices are necessary for drama, you still want it to be somewhat believable). The non-zombie dynamics & drama heighten the stakes on the zombie action. And the overall storyline is both engaging and believable in the context of the story. I still haven't seen the last two seasons, but i'm psyched season 2's on netflix so i can see what happens next!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved the second season even more.  Great character development and insights into English life during and immediately after the first World War.  I really enjoyed being able to view this ondemand with the new Amazon instant streaming feature too.  Handy with the ipad!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|This is a 4, all because of the limited character development. I like the movie, but other than the two lead roles, I really felt zero connection with any of the other characters. They make you feel as tho you are supposed to care when someone dies for example, but they kill them off before they develop the character.
0007105045|5.0|According to the description, \\"published for the very first time, we are treated to the translation of Tolkien's account of the Battle of Maldon, known as The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth.\\"  No, not so much.  I included some things from \\"The Homecoming of Beorthnoth, Beorhthelm's Son\\" in a college English paper between 35 and 40 years ago.  I couldn't have done that if it had never been published before.<br /><br />And Wikipedia says this:<br />\\"The Homecoming of Beorhtnoth Beorhthelm's Son\\" is the title of a work by J. R. R. Tolkien that was originally published in 1953 in volume 6 of the scholarly journal Essays and Studies by Members of the English Association.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|I streamed the movie from Amazon, love that it 1080 px & HD surround souond, it was fun watching for me, seeing comic book super heroes all together in the same movie , it worth renting.
0345803485|1.0|This book was really very bad.<br /><br />The opening chapter grabs you just barely enough to make you want to find out if it will get better because something that starts off this bad has only one direction to go.  As a person who does interviews for a living (Human Resources) I cringed at the questions written by Kate, and spoken to a CEO by Ana.  I thought, okay this is setting the stage for something; don't give up on the book so soon.<br /><br />I thought that Ana was an 18 year old high school grad but I had to remind myself that the book description said 21 year old college graduate (and the billionaire CEO just so happens to be 26/27).  This was one of many indications that this book was not going to go well. It never fails to angers me when the author tries to sell a boy in the role reserved for someone who should be at least 30+ years old.<br /><br />I read this book word for word all the way up to chapter 2 and then I began skipping through the overdrawn and extremely boring parts.  As I quickly wound my way up to chapter 9 I completely disliked Christian and Ana was getting on that proverbial \\"Last Nerve\\" of mine (but I liked her at this point better than him).  Ana had made it all the way through college with a hot and very sexually active roommate without having had a kiss, masturbated or had sex.  I can almost buy the whole virgin part, but her little home-girl couldn't even hook her up with one of her ex's in the 4 years they lived together so that she could get her first kiss???<br /><br />Ana never thought anything was wrong with the fact that this guy she met once is casually walking into her place of employment because he was in the neighborhood and then magically \\"finds\\" her at a random bar to save her from her drunken self.  He buys her a computer and sends some really expensive books that she convinces herself are \\"on loan\\".  My favorite part of this book is the Non Disclosure Agreement that he sends home with her.  He is a Billionaire CEO ofa major corporation and he just hands off - to a child - an explicitly detailed description of how he plans to bring her about as his submissive, gives her sites to go \\"research\\" and all this is supposedly at the advice of his attorney. If a real attorney knows his client has these kinds of extreme fetishes that NDA never would have left the office and her decision would have been made on the spot - otherwise, look at the risk he has just taken with his billion-dollar company and his reputation should she become \\"disgruntled\\".<br /><br />After I passed chapter 12 I felt that the 10 dollars I spent had to be justified even if it meant lowering myself to finishing this book.  The more into it I read the sadder I became for the people who actually enjoyed it.  It was written very badly, and it is basically (for lack of a better word) approving abusive relationships.  Him spanking her 3 times and harnessing her up to something hanging from the ceiling to have sex standing up, were the only instances that touched on the whole BDSM.  The fact that she had an explosive orgasm every single time he touched her \\"down there\\" was probably supposed to make up for the way he played with her mind to get her to agree to stepping into this world when (as she put it) had nothing to compare it to.<br /><br />The ending was the worst of all for me.  She spent the better part of this book asking him to tell her more about his obviously f'd up child hood, which he strongly states he does not want to talk about; she gets him to open up and agrees to the ultimate spanking and then does what she just said she would not do, leave him.  The book ends with the back and forth nonsense \\"I'm walking home - no take a cab - no I will get home on my own - no my driver will take you\\" then you cut to her in her new apartment with her crying \\"what did I just do?\\"  And there the book ends.  I REFUSE to buy the next 2 books to find out what happens next as this story was just so bad, I don't care.
1449410243|4.0|How to Tell If Your Cat Is Plotting to Kill You is a 2012 collection of cat-themed comics by Matthew Inman from his website, The Oatmeal. It features a large number of comics from the site, plus a few new ones.<br /><br />At their best, Inman's comics are offbeat, manic, vulgar, and over the top, and under any circumstances, they aren't for the easily offended. On the whole, the comics collected here are quite enjoyable, if perhaps not quite up to the level of funniness Inman has generated in the past. Several comics are little more than whimsically put-together observations of cat behavior. There are a couple of classics here, though, including \\"How to Pet a Kitty\\" and \\"Cat VS Internet.\\"<br /><br />The book itself is high quality, with thick, glossy pages, and most of the comics are in color.<br />This is a decent-sized book - 130 pages - but it's an extremely quick read, as many of the pages only feature one panel each. Half the book (literally) is comprised of \\"The Bobcats\\" and \\"Cat VS Internet\\" - this latter has been stretched out to 21 pages. Obviously, Inman has to adapt his comics to the dimensions of the printed page, but caveat emptor.<br /><br />Cat-loving Oatmeal fans should get plenty of mileage out of this book; fans of only one or the other may get substantially less.
1401322786|1.0|Have  always enjoyed Mitch //albums books, but I found this one the least interesting.  It was hard to keep my interest and I know it was a fable, but it was so unbelievable .
0307352145|4.0|[[ASIN:0307352145 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]] begins with the soft-spoken strength of Rosa Parks and continues with how America shifted from a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality. Offering alternatives and suggestions on how cultural values affect social standing in different environments, Cain provides a wise optimism to help those who may feel lost. In the end, [[ASIN:0307352145 Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking]] is a welcome read that honors the introverted in all of us and shows how we can be true to ourselves in a world that can't stop talking.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|ALL I CAN SAY IS OMG :). I WANT A CHRISTIAN GREY AROUND , BUT NOT UP FOR THE HARD CORE STUFF.. ENJOY LADYS AND GENTS

B0033H7VI6|4.0|I love this knife so much that I immediately ordered another one within days of receiving the first one. It is an outdoors workhorse tool. It can cut, chop, and baton with the best of them. It seems to have great steel and holds a great edge. The handle on the knife fits the hand very well and the rubbery grip is very comfortable. It is a quite heavy knife and probably not for backpackers concerned about carrying the extra weight. If what you need is an all around great tool for camping, hunting, and fishing, this will fit the bill. I gave it 4 stars instead of the full 5 only because I really don't like the sheath that comes with it all that much. The knife is 5 stars, the sheath is about 3 stars. Buy it, you will love it.
0316789720|5.0|Easy to follow instructions. I understand why his books are so well recommended - I will do the same for others.
B008QZ1ZYQ|2.0|Loved the original and I was looking forward to the extra levels here, but it just crashes every 30 seconds or so if there's no data connection available :-(
B009IQ0TGM|3.0|I have to admit I'm a bit disappointed with this album. I just discovered Lights about a month ago from my teenie-bopper babysitter and gave it a listen, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised. Bought the album and listened to it over and over. I was very excited to learn how late I was in discovering this artist and would be rewarded by having a new album to listen to in a few short weeks. I purchased the album this past weekend and listened to it during a few long drives. Unfortunately, I find this album to be greatly lacking in the lyrics department. I typically steer away from this genre altogether, but it was the lyrics and depth of the words on Lights that drew me in and I was hoping to find the same on Halycon, which I did not. This album seems to be rushed and forced and it shows in the repetitiveness of her lyrics. There is very little story to these songs. I will say My Blood is fabulous, haunting, sad and an excellent work of storytelling...there are some lovely songs, Only You, Atlantis, Don't Say a Word...but overall they are just the same repetitive verses. Musically the album is on point with Lights, but for those that are looking for lyrical content this album falls short.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good game very challenging. As levels increase so does the difficulty.  Requires concentration and quiet surroundings. Good game for a rainy day.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen has the kind of clever wit that elevates her observations of people and life to the level of Mark Twain's humor, which in my opinion is usually beyond comparison. She has the ability to illuminate the laughable eccentricities of the human experience without the mean deprecations or the vulgar profanity that is too often the hallmark of comtemporary humorists. I was looking for a book to put a chuckle or two in my day; I got one that at times had me frequently laughing out loud. Thanks Ellen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A solid read . Kept me rivited could not put these books down. Will suggest these books to all my friends.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I have the original on my laptop and played it to the end. This version is excellent on my Kindle Fire. However I got it free but was surprised when it stopped after several levels and asked for a five dollar payment for the full version. I'm not sure if I will pay that much yet.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|less interesting than the previous reacher books. i have problems believing relationships between reacher and the fbi agents. also i didn't read it in one gulp. was reading it in public transport for a week. child needs a big effort to make up for this. if the next book will be like this, i will not read the next after next one.
098555780X|4.0|I thought the book was very easy to follow. The pictures were very clean and clear . I gave the book four stars because I like to look at the pictures and try to make the knots, but you do have to read to figure some of them out. Overall this is a great book and I'm looking forward to the next one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Excellent read - the author is a great story teller who uses inventive plot devices and a creative structure - both of which underscore the novel's main themes.  Part history and part science fiction, \\"Cloud Atlas\\" draws you in and keeps you wrapped up in its multi-layered \\"cocoon\\" of a story! I'm now reading it again for the second time!

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this type of game great graphics and very addictive. The colors are beautiful and I actually read story lines.  I found myself wanting to complete the entire game in one sitting lol but I didn't I'm on last jewel now so sad that it is about to be over. But will look and see what other games Playrix has to offer.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case muffled the sound and the screen popped out while I was putting my phone in it. :( didn't seem very life proof to me!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game and a good time waster. But it is heavy on battery usage. Very entertaining and amusing
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read in a long time. It is about Clay, a nice, quite boy. He comes home one day to find tapes from Hannah Baker, one of his classmates who recently committed suicide. The tapes re-account the most significant times of Hannah's life and ultimately the thirteen reasons why she decided to end her life. You really get to know Hannah and Clay throughout the book and you feel what they do. Clay's life is changed by the tapes and he gets emotional while listening to them. The book is beautifully written and the topic is so interesting. I'm a slow reader, books always take me at least a month and I read this in 3 days. Written like a suspense novel with the plot of a drama, it's perfect for anyone who likes to feel emotion, teens and adults both, but I think teens could relate better. Overall this book it a fantastic read and it will teach you the importance of taking chances and following your heart.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|This socket arm extension is made really well and the knob turns to loosen or tighten, really easily.  Very easy to adjust for repositioning and/or removal.  I'm impressed with the overall design and quality of composition.<br /><br />Chris
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Best superhero movie ever made. Lots of action as expected with soem clever writing for the heroes despite their power whether human or not that they too have emotions. Best scene was Hulk giving Loki a reminder he was not what he thought he was by using him as a rag doll.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book is very touching. It moved me and has taught me very valuable lessons about life and appreciating everything we have. I had to read this for sociology and was upset about all the reading I had to do but once I started reading I couldn't put it down!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Amazing part two of this series!!! Even better than the first and far surpassed my expectations! Can't wait for the next installment since I can get enough of these characters and the author doesn't let me down at all!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the 3rd book of the trilogy.  Enjoyed the extra ending.  First book was good, but the last two were much better.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love, love, love!!!! I couldn't put this down. I wanted something after I read SOG and this was better!! Much better written and enjoyed the story a whole lot more. It kept me up all night! Can't wait for the next one!
B0087HT36U|4.0|I think it is more enjoyable than Angry Birds.  And it works better too.  The graphics are cool too along with the challenges.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|Even though I waited a little while for it to come, when I got it and played it, I realized the waiting was worth it!!!
B004EPZ08Y|2.0|Horror franchises typically stumble when they get to Part Fives. Friday the 13th Part V: terrible. Saw V: awful. Halloween 5: appalling. Strangely many of them use 3D as a way of pulling in the punters for gore effects that splatter into three dimensions. Final Destination 5 is nothing new and no exception to this rule despite not being completely awful.<br /><br />A bunch of cronies on an office retreat survive a suspension bridge collapse after one of the group inexplicably has a premonition (sounds overly familiar) of said disaster. Death doesn't like to be cheated...Tony Todd...ironic accidents...blah blah...exposition...you're all going to die...yadda yadda...one by one...blah blah blah blah. It's the same old rehashed plot, recycled dialogue, and overdone deaths that seem to defy logic and physics. As usual there is a last minute twist, which by this point you're just waiting to be revealed and get it finished with, that doesn't quite add up for many reasons, but coherence has hardly been a strong point of the series.<br /><br />Basically, all this film offers are a few scenes of dread and tension which are all undone by cheap, fake, quick, deflating CGI gore effects. Not once in my life have I ever been horrified by computer-generated blood. Give me some tangible gore by Chris Walas or Tom Savini any day over something half-heatedly cartooned onto the movie in post-production.<br /><br />This series has been cheating death for 12 years and it's high time that Final Destination reached its final destination.
B00097E4A6|5.0|I think almost everything has been said about this wonderful... should I call it \\"toy\\"? I've enjoyed countless hours of fun and joy with my 3 kids (7, 5 and 2 y/o) building tracks and it's always a challenge to build a track that closes properly, even for grown ups, more so when you include elevated segments.<br /><br />This set works not only as a bridge but also as a start/end of any elevated track. Is so much fun to try to build one. If you haven't tried yed, you should start now. Youtube will surely provide with inspiration.<br /><br />I have only one regret: I bought this bridge really cheap here in Amazon. You just have to keep looking at the item and check when the price goes down. Unfortunatelly, I bought only one of them. I can't even count the possibilities that would give us to have 2 of this set. I should have bought two. So don't be like me and if you find it cheap and you can afford it, seriously consider buying 2... or 3...

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much.  The writing was excellent and told the story very well.<br />The length of the book was just right leaving me with the urge to read the next one<br />in the series.
0316228532|5.0|I must admit I bought this book because I am a huge J.K. Rowling fan.<br />I've read all her Harry Potter books and LOVE them as an adult who appreciates her in-depth characters, detailed scenes, and endless imagination.<br />Having said that, I certainly hoped this new book would be a departure from her previous work, because I wanted something NEW from this brilliant writer. And I definitely got that.<br />The book is a little slow to start, because there are so many characters and trying to keep up with all of them requires a bit of going back and forth to remember them all in the first 25 or so pages.<br />But then, it picks up speed like a train. The characters rotate in having the story told from their viewpoint, and as we progress, the story circles tighter and tighter till we get to the beautiful and tragic conclusion.<br /><br />There is a lot of profanity and graphic language but it's important to setting the tone and not at all gratuitous or done for shock value.<br /><br />The thing I love about her books is even after I finish it, I can feel the characters moving around and living like they're real. She does such a beautiful job of making them come alive. It's been a long time since I cried at the end of a book.<br /><br />This was a great story from a gifted storyteller and goes to prove she has a lot of completely different stories in her waiting to be told. The standard best-selling writers today would have taken the safe way and written another same-formula story. Thank you JK Rowling for giving us interesting and thought-provoking reading.
1596680296|5.0|Teach yourself how to knit socks with this book. I did it and so can you. I am not advanced in knitting at all.  Ann Budd is a wonderful teacher and her directions are so clear.  The only problem you may have is buying too much sock yarn!  Great book.
6305127689|5.0|Top Gun is one of those movies you simply must see at least once. It's a great struggle and overcoming picture that stays with you. There is believable humor and equal seriousness that make this movie a good balanced tale. DVD & packaging was as expected.

B00005OCMR|5.0|Tron is a \\"must-see\\" movie for any young boy. It fires the imagination. I saw this when I was young and only really remember parts of it so it was nice to see the whole thing and be able to see some interviews with the stars and other makers of the movie and hear of it's impact on the movie going generations. Packaging was as expected.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|ok, so this app is really fun, but there's only one thing that I dissagree with. its the colors . they need to lower the price for the colors. other than that, its great and a fun thing to do with friends.)
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Nice to have all four movies in one package. Individual DVDs in slim cases inside a cardboard case. All movies widescreen and I remember seeing \\"new\\" scenes on these DVDs that must have been cut out when I had watched them on TV years ago so it was a nice feeling to \\"finally be seeing the shows in their entirety.\\" Classic \\"must-see\\" movie when you're a young boy. I had my three boys watch them (9, 7 & 5) and after each show, they were all doing Karate moves on me.
B0058YPILY|2.0|Came packaged as brand new but had a deep gouge on disc four.  We tried to run it through our disc repair unit but it wouldn't fix.  A good part of the episode skipped and froze making it hard to capture the content.  This is not the normal quality we have gotten from Amazon with our numerous purchases.  We will continue to use Amazon because of our track record with them but are unhappy with this purchase.
B005I64U5C|5.0|It's a widescreen, 3D, Blu-Ray so it's quality is great! You also have the regular Blu-Ray and DVD versions included as well. Packaging was as expected. Nice modern introduction to the Green Lantern genre. Ryan Reynolds is a good actor. I purchased the 3D version for the same price that the regular Blu-Ray was selling for.
1595141715|4.0|A bit hard to follow, but a good message!  Read this because our granddaughter was reading it and wanted to see for myself how it was presented.  I teach suicide intervention skills and wanted to see what I could gain from this book.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|There aren't many movies that are a \\"Must Own\\" but this movie has everything for the fan of this genre. The humor, wit, pacing, drama, believability, acting, casting, writing, cinematography, sound and effects are phenomenal! The storyline of all the recent Marvel movies culminates in this Avengers story. There are a couple of times that make you think the bad guys are going to win. Like in [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars: The Complete Saga (Episodes I-VI) [Blu-ray]]], the bad guys are very often matched in ability with the good. Can't wait to watch it in 3D again at home!
B009QW7HMC|5.0|I don't have cable these days, essentially watching the few shows I'm interested in online and WD is one of them.  I thought the last episode of season 2 was fantastic and have been dying to see how'd they kick off season 3.<br /><br />Pitch perfect - advance of the story, lots of action, and I'm finding it hard to wait for episode 2!
0790729644|5.0|I like that the main character doesn't want to live the life of a criminal anymore, and when an opportunity arises for him to use his \\"skills\\" for good (protecting others from evil) and to make some sorely needed extra money, William Munny goes back on the job. Bullies get their comeuppance in this show, but revenge as well as fighting for what's right always seem to carry it's own losses. Widescreen DVD & packaging was as expected.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book. I can't stop reading it. I can't wait for the fourth one. I highly recommend this book
B00992CF6W|2.0|Please make the app better by putting all the things you can get like fire buckets water, etc. It would be a 4 star then. Thanks Colby
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Film was really easy to apply over freshly opened iPhone.<br />Make sure you remove OEM film and attach protective film at once, so no dust gets under it.<br />Cover itself is OK looking, but definitely provides great protection with ample barrier level.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I am not a gamer or a sci-fi fan, but i really loved this book! It was never something i thought i would enjoy, but once I started, I couldn't put it down. Definitely give this novel a chance!
B004U52VPS|4.0|This product is nice, but it takes 4-6 minutes to build your castle!<br />But its a nice product and I like it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I was with my niece today, who is 16, and started saying the lyrics to some ridiculous new song with terrible lyrics laced with profanity.  There was no meaning, just a lot of nonsensical words put to a terrible arrangement of autotuners.<br /><br />From the first notes of \\"Being Good\\", you are reminded as to why Barbra Streisand is the best selling, most iconic, award winning musical artist of all time.<br /><br />At first, I thought the title \\"Release Me\\" was odd - but now I get it.  All of these songs scream \\"Release Me\\".<br /><br />Willow Weep for Me, Didn't We, How are things in Glocca Morra/Heather on the Hill, and the list goes on.  To think that these were hidden in the vault pain me - simply because they are so wonderful - and we are reminded of the masterful arrangements by such wonderful composers and rich, talented orchestras.<br /><br />And the fact that most of these songs were done in ONE take.  One listen to \\"I Think It's Going To Rain Today\\", with just her and Randy Newman - for all of the people who have covered this song, in one rare take, she, in her true form, lays it out once, and it's done.  The songs penetrate your heart and mind and soul.  They are timeless.  And PS - get the Vinyl if you still have a record player.  It's like walking back in time.<br /><br />This is a must have for any Streisand fan, and anyone who appreciates true talent, which we have seem to lost in today's music world.  There will only ever be one Barbra Streisand, and this LP reminds us why.
1442419814|4.0|A bit slow but the premise is really interesting.  There wasn't much action until the end.  There were just a few bits of excitement here and there throughout the book but for the most part I felt most parts went on and on for far too long. I will say that it ended interestingly enough that I want to read the second book.
0525953728|5.0|Educational, well-written, exciting, suspensful.  All these describe this book.  Like the book and movie about Apollo 13, you know how it will end but the story is too good to stop reading.
B0085TKAW6|3.0|I was very much looking forward to the second book in this series by Ken Follett - while I did really enjoy reading this book it was probably not as enjoyable as the first. However the historical perspective was very interesting and offered a different view of WW2 as Follett so often is able to do with historical settings. Will still look out for the third in the series
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I was very leary of this movie and this soundtrack because I was a teen through the 80s who LOVED all the pop, rock, and hard rock music... and this soundtrack features so many of my favorites from Pat Benatar to Journey right into the metal of Scorps and Twisted Sister into the hairbands of Extreme and Warrant and more.  I was afraid they would poke fun of the era or be really loose and stupid with it all.  Well... I was WRONG.  The movie was so much fun... and the soundtrack allows you to revisit the movie in your mind.  The song renditions are all at once faithful to the originals and different... and the mashing up of songs is extremely well thought out and executed.  Even though some of the songs are very short... they are satisfying, especially after you have seen the movie and can remember how they were applied to the story as you listen.<br /><br />I think this whole movie was mis-marketted... so many fans of the 80s felt like I did and stayed away... had they done a better job in showcasing the fun and also that they were laughing WITH us... NOT AT us... far more of us would have caught this in the theater.  I bought the movie out of curiousity after refusing to pay to see it in the theater due to my incorrect perceptions.  Anyway... ABSOLUTELY buy the movie... best musical since Moulin Rouge... better than Bourlesque which I also enjoyed.  Then once you have bought or at least seen the movie... get the soundtrack because its a great compliment to the movie.
B009SJ47XA|5.0|Unbelievable visuals,great characters ,intriguing script,disturbing and delicious. Can't wait to see subsequent episodes a week is too long to wait!
B00992CF6W|5.0|love this game, although this app is my first experience with the whole minecraft stuff, I was never a fan of it...in fact I used to hate on people played it now I'm a strong supporter of it. it just needs lava, ability to make cool stuff like a holy sword, it needs ability to equip armor. other then that I love it!<br />SO GET IT...ITS ONLY $6.99 IT COULD BE WORSE. TOTALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY.<br />WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR...??! JUST HIT THE FREAKIN BUY BUTTON....DOOOOOOO ITTTTT NOOOWWWWW!!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! The controls are smooth & the animation is great. I finished the entire game already & I'm dying for more levels to be added! Great app & great price!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Excellent. I have been a fan of this show since it started and decided to buy the entire collection Wonderful idea for those who rather watch comedy than any other show.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I can't put it down; it gets more challenging the further you get.<br /><br />It is a l lot of fun!
1475290411|5.0|This is a kind of book that you can read again and again. Everyone can relate to the book. You definitely become what you think. Good or Bad.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I started out thinking I could read this book slowly and savor it but found I couldn't put it down! I loved the complex characters,the dialog,the plot and the roller-coaster ride of emotions. I loved the way both Eva and Gideon fought for their difficult relationship and ultimately saved each other. The ending was so mesmerizing I read it over and over again for days after finishing. I missed them so, I went back and read Bared to You again to pick up what I missed about the start of the relationship, and am about to read Reflected in You again. I am obsessed with these characters and looking forward to the next book. I also thank Sylvia Day for writing an actual book-length story and not teasing her readers along with a chapter at a time. For some reason reading the Crossfire novels has enhanced the sweet, uncomplicated relationships in my own life, given me more energy and made me feel more alive.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|The Chevy Chase lampoons are by far the best, and this one is just as funny as National Lampoons Vacation.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story just gets better and better. I love all the broken relationships and the struggles with their combined worlds. I can't wait for December to comes and the story continues. I am truly obsessed.
B009IJJ712|3.0|For what it is (and isn't), this program is OK. I'd like it better if it were more Canon, but a female Watson isn't a radical idea, and the mystery was good enough. What I don't like is that this Holmes (like Downey's) is a slob. Many times in his writings, Watson mentioned how clean and well-groomed Holmes kept himself, even while living in a prehistoric hut during \\"Hound of the Baskervilles.\\" I think for the character of Holmes to be properly realized, he must be fastidiously neat because he needs it to stay aloof and in control. This aspect must be easily grasped by the British since I've only seen a dirty Holmes in American productions. In addition, it would have been nice if the producers had found an actor with the light metallic grey eyes Watson described so often.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child never disappoints. He turns out a winner each and every time, and A Wanted Man is no exception. Can't wait for his next one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a really good game and addicting fun. if u like rpgs then u will really like this game
B0012GMXBK|5.0|in my opinion a flawless album, i saw them at the utah state fair grounds on this tour in 1985 they were amazing! these were the days when every band out there was wearing a gallon of hairspray and writng wussy love songs like winger,slaughter and a bunch of other lame bands! accept didnt go that route and im thankful!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great fun.  You can't go wrong with Big Fish Games! The graphics are clear and easy to see. The game itself is easy to follow and the &quot;hint&quot; feature helps if you get stuck. There are plenty of hidden items games throughout.
6305633177|5.0|this was metallica in the day, no wussy sandman or fuel, cliff never would have played that garbage! in my strong opinion metallica died with cliff, and it is really sad. i met cliff at a marriot hotel in 1986 and he signed my stuff and was a really cool guy. a few months later he was gone. some of the songs on in justice were written by cliff thats one reason it rocks! the black album to me is metallicas funeral! they turned into the band they swore they would never become. this dvd is full of great tunes and moments with cliff and the gang from 83-86 when the metal militia reighned supreme. no wimpy songs, they were drunk,stoned and ready to take on the world! long before james went into rehab. even some dave mustaine on here. metal up your a**!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001POXA02|5.0|This watch is heavy but I like it. I have had no problems with the illumination as others have indicated. I had to take to a jeweler to remove some links. The manual has no instructions to do this. Probably for the best and he only charged $6.00. Overall, I would say this is an excellent watch for the money. I have worn for two weeks now.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I first heard about these guys about 6 months before they hit they hit it big in  US, from a friend in the UK - I am so glad to have had that extra time to have enjoyed them to myself ;-). This album picks up where the first left off and continues the wonderful story-telling, angst and ultimate faith in human nature that Marcus Mumford seems to find hiding in the corners.  Buy it - you won't be sorry.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I watched this movie because it stars my favorite actress Charlize Theron and she did great! It's just another popcorn movie for me.
B000002UJQ|4.0|\\"Ok Computer,\\" is an incredibly dense and mature work. There are so many complex rhythms, and layers of synthesizers that it is hard to sort out, but that is the point.  Life is hard to sort out.  You just have to sit back and let it wash over you, pick up what you can, and let the rest go. The theme of the album is the exponential quicking of the pace of life and culture in the late 20th century. Remembering that this work is now 15 years old, the message of Yorke in 1997 was prophetic, because lie did not slow down in the 21st Century.  The song \\"Paranoid Android\\" is melodic, with a funky baseline, and haunting vocals.  Of course all of Thom Yorke's vocals are haunting.  The song speaks of the lack of power that we have in today's society. \\"Let Down,\\" speaks of Yorke's disappointment with culture, life, and society.  He actually lived this as he went into a deep post album depression.  \\"Karma Police,\\" warns that you had better not mess with the status quo.  \\"Electioneering\\" is a dystopian work with a Beatles like intro and a Sonic Youth mayhem inspired outtake.  The album ends with the song, \\"The Tourist,\\" which is a plea to slow down.  \\"OK Computer\\" is very cerebral, so don't try to dance to it. But it just might make you smarter.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|this is very well done in my opinion and at times very frightening for those with problems with claustrophobia or<br />the prospect of drowning.  I think it was very well done.  Stephen Spielberg is the executive director.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Drive Angry, the two main stars are the '69 Charger 440 and the '71 Chevelle SS.  Great twist on the old classic car chase movies!  Piper is a kick ass gal that cant hold her own against about anyone.  I'm glad to see that this 'new' car chase movie went back to the basics on most of the car chases, and left the CGI special effects craps to the other losers out there, yes 'Nick' I am referring to you.  I'd love to see the producers do a new twist on Vanishing Point, cause I kinda' feel like this is a new age Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry, with a ton of attitude.  How could you not love a bar called 'The Bull by the Balls?'  11 out of 10 in my book.  Can't go wrong if you love car chase movies.
1608870081|5.0|This is a very detailed, incredible book...beautiful illustrations,  and accurate.  An excellent keepsake, and a  magical gift for any fan.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love pinterest but the app could use some work.  I often have to force close because it wont load properly.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Latest chapter to our collection.  Nothing better than a rainy weekend, popcorn and blankets to review or catch up or wait for the snow day to have Supernatural Fest and watch from the beginning!  Every episode is a new horror movie.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is one of my favorite fiction heros. He saves people, local governments, meets many interesting villians, occasionaly has a romantic interlude and does it all without any crude language. While this particular novel seems to have more than the usual description of the the local areas it still has the basic ability to hold my interest throughout.  For me, another Lee Child success.  Can't wait for the next one.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|I think the subject is boring and the characters have no appeal.  The background is dark and depressing and a little strange.
B0053O89WY|5.0|The show is fabulous!  Intelligent and funny.  I'm addicted. Delivery was much faster than expected.  And the quality of packing was fine.  I've watched the DVDs over and over, and still laugh out loud.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|This book was okay. After reading it I did not go on to read the others in the series. Just an okay read, but I would not recommend it to anyone.
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|Well it is very fun to play.  Want to be addicted.?  Play this awesome game!  Just don't forget to go to work!
B006VREHRS|4.0|It is good but can be a little confusing with so many different characters and different locations.Acting is terrific though.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I like it in many ways but dislike it because I cannot get it to stand firmly.  Also when I try to hold it like a book, the side without the Kindle, the screen cover, bends and makes it impossible to read so I have to fold the cover back.  When I fold it back, my fingers interfer with the screen and cause the picture to flip or the definition or note screen to come on while I am reading.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is great. I wake up every morning and check it and it is always right. I love how it has everything including something that tells you Wich way the wind is going. this is a great app and it is worth buying.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Wow my kind of game. And it was totally free. It paid off watching the free apps everyday.  Will be looking for more playrix games.
B004GCPJDQ|3.0|This device works well, but there are design problems with the latching mechanism on the battery pack, which if you're lucky, the latch will end up under the Magic Mouse button (as shown on Mobee's web site installation video).<br /><br />Installing the battery pack is easy and has nothing to do with common sense as noted elsewhere.  Installation is controlled by a design feature that keys the battery pack so it can ONLY be installed in one manner, otherwise it would fall out (idiot proof). And worth noting, if you've had your magic mouse for any time, you're an expert at manipulating the battery cover.<br /><br />However, even when the battery pack is installed with the lip on the top, under the top edge of the mouse, the latch on my unit failed to seat properly, causing intermittent wireless connectivity issues, and my battery did actually fall out a few times before I finally requested a replacement.  While the replacement process is easy, if inconvenient, at least Amazon has great customer service, so no biggie.<br /><br />And by the way, it's all much easier and more convenient than replacing batteries so frequently. So YEA for Mobee for coming up with a good looking device that removes the shackles of regular/rechargeable batteries - it's the convenience that matters most in my books, otherwise just buy rechargeable and continue to charge/reload batteries on a regular basis.<br /><br />Update - March 2013 - After using this device for five months, I change my rating to three stars. Here's the update.  The mouse often times loses connectivity via USB and display the mouse icon on the screen with (disconnected) under the image.. I have found the quickest way to recover from the problem is to switch the mouse off then back on again, place the mouse back on the mouse pad, and click it a few times.  Then the mouse icon and \\"connected\\" comes up within 10-15 seconds.  I also think that after using it for five months, I understand what I do that makes it disconnects.  When I lift the mouse off the pad momentarily or move the mouse off the side of the pad inadvertently, it OFTEN times will lose the Bluetooth connection.  I don't understand the WHY of that scenario, but I do know those actions will result in a lost Bluetooth connection.  And since I never had that problem with batteries, perhaps the lower charge available on these or an instant shut off switch is responsible...dunno just speculating.<br /><br />You can also see that the bottom of the mouse apparently isn't even and the two black rails that run down each side have worn nearly completely...resulting in a badly worn Mobee battery pack.  While it does not affect the operation of the unit, it clearly indicates something wrong with the fit and finish as I noted earlier.<br /><br />And finally, the battery life is adequate to last through a long day, but a very active day of gaming/heavy use can drain the mouse during the same day.<br /><br />So, when this battery pack finally runs out, I'll probably just go back to rechargeable batteries which are essentially allows for the same scenario if you use two sets (one in the mouse and one in the charger)...AND you won't suffer the fit/finish or loss of  connectivity issues.When I lift the mouse off the pad momentarily or move the mouse off the side of the pad inadvertently, it OFTEN times will lose the Bluetooth connection.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to pass the time. Might not be for everybody but it sure works for me.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Get the popcorn and pick the comfortable chair people. It's movie time!<br />The Avengers is an excellent super hero movie in every way. Great story, nice character development, and amazing special effects. More than that though, it was funny and humanized the heroes. Marvel has always done a good job of this and I am glad the concept followed them into this movie. I was really surprised to see the funniest hero to be the Hulk(i.e. Hulk/Loki, Hulk/Thor, Hulk/Ironman) You would expect the Tony Stark character to get all the funny lines, but Hulk ruled the screen.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|I installed the update today and now the app does not work. I hope they fix it soon! Blah blah blah
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game, I got it as the free app of the day, it would definitely be worth paying for!!! Get it!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|I read the book and saw the movie many years ago.  I am very pleased that I now have the book and the DVD.  Excellent!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|I have everything Streisand ever recorded so of course I was going to purchase this CD, but not only Streisand fanatics will love it!  For new fans it provides a spectrum of her incomparable talent from the 60s to today, ballads and broadway, love songs, and as always dramatic renderings of some of the finest music.  No one, no one does it like her and I would encourage those who have not bought her CDs in the past to listen to this.  I guarantee you will starty buying many of her past recordings from every era!  But those who already know of her great talent will especially LOVE this CD.  As you listen to each song it will take you back to a particular album or stage of her singing career and conjure up fine memories.  Listening to Try to Win A Friend (one of my favorites on the entire CD) will take you back to Butterfly and Superman, Glocca Morra, Heather on the Hill and Home will make you once again appreciate that no one can sing a theatre musical song like Streisand, she doesn't sing she interprets as only she can!!  Randy Newmans Think its Going to Rain is a true find she sounds beautiful.  She is often criticized for the overproduction of her albums but certainly not the case here, you get pure Streisand vocals that prove (as if proof was needed) she is truly the greatest female singer of our time -- of all time EVAH!  Everyone will love this CD and we can only hope there will be a volume two as promised.  SHE DID IT AGAIN!!!!!!  THE best.  For those, like me, who are lucky enough to see the current tour you will be presently surprised at how many songs she does from the CD and HOW GREAT SHE STILL SOUNDS!!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is way better than the movie!! It has so much that the movie didn't. Read the book before you watch the movie [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games (Book 1)]].
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Watched yesterday the 3d version Bluray(just got released in India) its just tooo good the 3d effects are one of the best seen till date & of course the audio 5.1(should have been 7.1) is awesome.I would strongly recommend to buy the combo 3d/2d bluray in case you are planning to buy a 3d tv/projector etc.Regarding the movie its the same old story about aliens but watching the movie on 3d is totally a mind blowing experience with amazing sound effects.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book it just made you want 2 read the next book which is not coming out till December. Must read
B0071DJZZA|5.0|When I first read the book I wasn't super excited about it. But now we're studying it in school. After re-reading it twenty times and studying every word I began to appreciate it more. Still not the best book, but one of the best, definitely recommend it for anyone. You may not like it, but it's well written and deals with very interesting and thought provoking ideas.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was so amazing such a great book hope they make more books like these the author really has a way of writing a book that catches everyone's attention
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Awesome album, you won't get enough, buy it now. Can't wait for the tour.  Lady gaga at her best, so far.
0316228532|1.0|I knew this book wasn't going to be another Harry Potter.  I knew it was going to be a \\"literary\\" novel exploring humanity's darker side.  But I didn't expect this.<br /><br />The writing's good, but that's the only good thing about it.  Everything else sucked, especially the people in it.  The characters are ALL stupid, narrow-minded, vicious and selfish--like Dursleys on steroids.  It could just be personal bias, but I HATE books like that.  While I watched them parade their stupid, narrow-minded, vicious and selfish lives across their limited stage, I just couldn't reconcile them with the fabulous, multi-faceted characters of Hogwarts.  Does Rowling think you have to have magic to be a likeable or complex character?<br /><br />The plot sucked, too.  It's like Rowling went out of her way to write a \\"serious, adult book\\" and ended up trying way, way too hard.  It has all the cliches of a literary novel--nasty characters, slow, tragic plot and somebody commits suicide at the end--without any of the interest.  A good literary novel might have ugly characters and a very slow tragedy for a plot, but it also makes you think, and see the world in a different way.  This didn't.  It just regurgitated all the hallmarks of \\"serious literature\\" in a pointless mass of dystopian misanthropy.  I honestly didn't care about a single one of the characters, and when one of them finally ended it all, I felt like cheering.  At that point, I was almost on the verge of copying her.<br /><br />Rowling: if you read this, please, PLEASE go back to writing fantasy and YA fiction!  It will be a tragedy if you don't!
B007NCSQFO|5.0|Nicki Minaj hasn't disappointed me yet. Especially with this album. Pink Friday reloaded also great. Love her style, stuck and attitude. Don't compare her to Lil Kim. But damn she sure is giving me something I've haven't heard from Kim in a long time
B003O5MO2A|5.0|Have to say that when I first time autumn 1979 heard \\"On Your Feet Or On Your Knees\\" as a 16 yo teenager, I was sold, totally sold for BOC and especially this album. It has followed me since those days everywhere I'm going, as a cd nowadays, ofcourse. I'll highly recommend even 1 single try to listen...
B000YABS8E|5.0|Blast from the Past is a hilarious comedy about something many of us remember - what to do in the case of a nuclear attack!<br /><br />The writing is great, the acting is so appropriate, and the characters are well-developed and interesting. I especially appreciated the fact that the writer used wit as humor, instead of foul language to keep the watcher engaged. I feel this is a movie that a family could watch together.
1435114949|5.0|I bought this as a present for my wife who enjoys Sherlock Homes stories on TV. She loves this book and recommends it for all Sherlock fans. Its handsome cover draws lots of compliments. It has the look of a collector's item.
B009329Y30|1.0|I loved the book!! Loved is a small word, couldn't wait for it to be turned into a movie.  Almost all of Nicholas Sparks' books turned out as great movies.  When I finally got to rent this movie, I was disappointed.  There was no chemistry between the characters, it looked like it was forced.  Zac Efron was not the best person to play Thibult.  He looked like a child with a mother lover.  I was so not into the movie I even left the room from time to time not caring what happened.  Biggest disappointment ever!  Best book and worst movie remake!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app for jotting down notes.great for writting information to sens to your computer or study griup.or even a daily dairy.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Gets more challenging the higher the level. Great time killer and addictive to boot.<br />Worth your time by all means.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addicted to pinterest, and once I saw that it was available on kindle fire, I got it. Used it since.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|Already had these on hd dvd's, but wanted to get them on blu ray. Excellent movies, excellent quality. 5 out of 5
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is much like Wikipedia with a dictionary thrown in. That's a good thing. You can play word games too and there are interesting quotes and articles daily to expand your knowledge. I use it every day with Words with Friends so I can know the meanings of the words I use.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|the action is definately worth the time for this game and its very easy to level up. would recommend this game to anyone who has been a fan of dungeon crawlers or God of war series.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|After being a little hesitant about this movie, I decided to get it. Boy am I glad. I truly enjoyed this movie. Not sure it will win any awards, but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. After watching it I have to admit, I ended up watching the original Alien.
B00422LESE|5.0|the seemingly endless debate about the myth of GOD has been  brought to a convincing end with his solid logic in simple & lucid terms in this grand work of Stephen  Hawking[[ASIN:0553805371 The Grand Design]]
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games are simple so its good for the kids. yes the ads are annoying but what do you expect for a free app. it's. basic at best,  but doesn't freeze up so that's ok.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I'm happy this was a freebie because it has become my new addiction! Love the different challenges and levels. Great fun!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and see.  Perfect for everyday calculations.  Looks just like a calculator and also keeps past calculations if needed.  I really like it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|That's how much I needed this app on my Droid.<br /><br />Fires can rage, hungry babies scream, dogs in urgent need of a walk can paw mercilessly at the door, and SWAT teams and attacking alien forces may burst through windows and walls, but I'll never know.<br /><br />I'm trying to bomb little green piggies.<br /><br />Beyond addictive.
1476712042|5.0|I love this book.  It's definitely one of my favorites.  Read it over the summer and reading it again.  Toward the end you get tired of them fighting but regardless was definitely a good story and ending.  Really like the idea of Abby's past and Travis's family.  Can't wait to read Walking Disaster in April.  I already preordered it.  It's supposed to be his side of the story with a peek into their future.  Love Travis and Abby to death.  :)
B005FITIDC|5.0|I LOVED how real and raw this movie was!  Seeing this perspective of the ongoing terror in Africa moved me to  get involved.
0440416027|5.0|I absolutely recommend this book to all crowds and ages. Skellig practically reads itself with interesting characters, an unpredictable plot, and triumph over hardships. Skellig is work of fiction about a boy named Michael who moves into a new house and has many adventures with his new blunt, feisty, friend Mina. Michael finds a very ill man named Skellig living in their rustic garage whom he befriends and feeds with \\"27 and 53\\" which are said to be \\"the sweetest of nectars\\" in Chinese food. The book is full of adventure and magic as Almond pushes his readers emotionally and creatively. I respect Almond in the greatest of ways and believe he deserves every award he gets.
B007THA4FI|4.0|FIRST-TIME READER OF THIS AUTHOR.  I DIDN'T READ ANY OF THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS. ENJOYED HER WRITING STYLE, AND THE CHARACTERS.  THE PLOT WAS OK, PROPOSING A GENERAL THEME OF MAN'S INADEQUACIES, ALONG WITH HIS BLINDNESS TO HIS OWN SELFISH JUDGEMENTS. CERTAINLY HIGHLIGHTED MAN'S PREJUDICE AND JUDGMENTAL ATTITUDES TOWARDS THE POOR AND MARGINALIZED.  IT WAS AN ENJOYABLE READ.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this series.  I love the reruns on tv and now I have them on DVD.  This show never ceases to make me laugh.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I ordered an extra cable to use with my car charger since I use my kindle fire hd so much. I didn't want to get caught traveling without it. My car charger has dual connections, so I can charge both my phone and kindle at the same time. Don't leave home without it!!!
1933784032|1.0|The 1 star is for the binding. Despite handling this book with great care as I read it, the binding has practically disintegrated. More than 1/3 of the pages have fallen out of the book. Very disappointing, and apparently not uncommon.<br /><br />Text and photos are great, but deserve a much better presentation.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena (The Heroes of Olympus, Book Three was a great addition to the Heroes of Olympus series. I really enjoyed the way Greek & Roman Mythology was combined with modern day life situations. The Book was a real pleasure to read. I give five stars to the book and the author.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|to describe what an awesome app this is. I use it on my phone, my kindle and my PC. Everything in one place and easy to access. Nuff said.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I admit I slipped Clockwork Angels into the player three weeks ago with low expectations.  Steampunk has kind of come and gone; Rush came to the party about 10 years late.  And a concept album?  Make that 20 years.  Add to this the gimmickry of simultaneously releasing a novel based on the same concept and it was easy to presume that the trio had finally burnt out and just phoned this one in, milking the cash cow one more time before hanging up the picks 'n' sticks for good.<br /><br />Was I ever wrong.<br /><br />A decade or two from now when the definitive history of this band is written, I suspect Clockwork Angels will stand as Rush's finest hour.  Folks, this album is good. Listen-a-hundred-times-over good.  Best-album Grammy good.  Dark-Side-of-the-freaking-Moon good. Really good. The bombast of Snakes and Arrows is mostly absent here, replaced by a musical breadth and depth every bit as powerful but far more complex and emotive.  This is one of the very few albums you can listen to over and over again, discovering something new each time.  A good set of headphones is recommended.  Messrs. Lee, Peart and Lifeson are all in top form, passing the lead around while executing complex transitions and tempo changes with an ease that must be heard to be believed.  There isn't a single weak track in the lot, and all twelve songs aside from the transitional \\"BU2B2\\" stand well on their own.<br /><br />They also stand well as a whole.  Unlike many \\"concept\\" albums this one, music and lyrics alike, tells a real, coherent story, and a halfway decent one.  In fact, it's a story you can read in detail in the [[ASIN:1770411216 companion novel]].  I referred above to the concurrent release of the novel as a \\"gimmick,\\" and maybe on some level it is, but it turns out to be a bold, creative and unique (afaik) one that, although not as strong as the album, generates a surprising amount of synergy with it.  If you like the album (and you will,) you'll like the book, and you'll findthe pair more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />It is nothing short of awe-inspiring that, after almost 40 years and 20 albums, Rush are making music like this.  Geddy, Alex and Neil, thank you.  Five stars with coldfire diamond clusters.
0312641893|4.0|I'm a sucker for retellings of Disney stories. You know all those cheesy Disney Cinderella remakes? Yeah, I've seen them all. The Hilary Duff one. The Selena Gomez one. All of them. AND I LOVE THEM!<br /><br />I took awhile to pick this one up, because there was something about the sci-fi cyborg aspect that turned me off. I wish I hadn't waited so long though, because this book was awesome! It's sci-fi, but a lighter version that's easy to read and not as tech-heavy as the hardcore sci-fi tends to be.<br /><br />Marissa Meyer's world building was a bit shaky at first and I struggled to get a feel for what it looked like, but her characters were all fleshed out and compelling and I got sucked in to their storylines almost from the first page.<br /><br />There was a \\"twist\\" at the end that was obvious from nearly the beginning. I think the first time the author hinted at it, it was extremely obvious. I don't know if she meant it to be obvious or not, but it definitely was. I won't go in to further detail because it would spoil the story, and because the story was still so much fun that it didn't matter.<br /><br />I am pretty upset at Meyer though, for that ending! Cliffhangers will be the death of me, for real. I can't wait for Scarlet (which appears to be Little Red Riding Hood plus Cinder!). Great book! Highly recommend! Don't let the sci-fi aspect scare you off, this is a great story!
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is wisely written.<br /> detail about life in the  middle age in England, the importance of the faith and the power within. The ambition and feeling of the characters could be easily of today's modern novel.<br />I liked the way Follet left his mystery and espionage to go into a passage of history well related.
0142420891|4.0|I liked this book so much more than If I Stay, and I don't know that I can really explain why. A lot of reviewers seemed to have disliked Adam's point of view compared to Mia's, but I preferred it.<br /><br />If I Stay had that bittersweet sort of ending that left a lot of unanswered questions, and this book answered all of them. Adam was so broken when Mia was in the accident, and Mia leaving him afterwards shattered him completely. It tore me apart to read about the pain he suffered when she left him and when she reappeared in his life.<br /><br />The writing was beautiful again, just as in the first novel, but I felt far more attached to the characters this time. Although there wasn't much 'plot' in this book, just as in the first, I didn't feel like it dragged. During If I Stay, I got bored of all the flashbacks. That wasn't the case with Where She Went. The breakdown and rebuilding of Adam and Mia's relationship was masterfully interwoven from chapter to chapter.<br /><br />I admit I was concerned with how Forman would end it, but my fears were for nothing because the ending is satisfying and beautiful and left me sitting here with a happy smile on my face. This book is very, very good!
B005EWDA9M|5.0|I was drawn straight into this fantastical story - it is hard to categorize - a romance in a very round about way, a fantasy, with intrigue and murder - quite unlike anything else I can think of. At once very simple and yet complex. It is littered with lovely little references, to things such as music and literature, that tie separate elements of the story together and it was hard to put down. I planned to read something else before starting on book 3 but within 5 minutes found myself just having to have a look - but that, as they say, is another story.
6305428271|4.0|It is not the best movie ever made about a determined teacher but this movie always manages to impress me. It is not the teen acting roles so much as maintaining a plot about gangster young adults with a mainly rap soundtrack AND keeping different types of viewers engaged. It truly is an empowering film. If this is a first time choice, I do recommend this movie, it managed to gain a lot of critical acclaim not only from average people like myself, but nationally as well. Just beware for inappropriate treatment of women, violence, and vulgarity. Not for anyone under 13 without parent viewing previously.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|Following on from [[ASIN:B0052RDHTM Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy]], this is the second in Ken Follett's Century trilogy. This sprawling saga takes a cast of characters, in England, Wales, America, Russia and Germany and weaves their stories together. Fall of Giants used momentous world events such as WWI, the Russian Revolution and the campaign for women to vote as the background for the characters; Winter of the World begins in 1933 and continues through the years of WWII until 1948.<br /><br />We meet many of the characters we are already familiar with in this book and also many of their children, now grown. When we meet Maud and Walter again in Berlin, they are trying to fight against the rise of National Socialism, although their son Erik is attracted to the Nazi party. Daisy Peshkov, now a grown women, comes to England hoping to marry a man with a title and Lloyd Williams is studying at Cambridge. Follett deftly involves real life people into his storyline - Oswald Mosley, Churchill, Roosevelt and others appear throughout the novel. We read of the Spanish Civil War, Red Army Intelligence, Dunkirk and other major historical events. However, where Follett succeeds is by never losing sight of the personal in the historical. We care about the characters and what happens to them and I am looking forward to reading the concluding novel in this trilogy.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Nick and Amy Dunne. Golden couple, intelligent, successful writers with a Brownstone in New York. Then the recession hits and they are both unemployed. They move to Nick's hometown of North Carthage Missouri to take care of Nick's ailing elderly parents. With Amy's money they buy a bar. Then on their fifth wedding anniversary Amy disappears under violent circumstances. The story of their marriage is told by Nick in first person and readings from Amy's diary.<br /><br />These characters although well developed, were so awful in the content of their character it was difficult to root for either of them, unless you can relate to the wealthy, whinny, manipulative liars. In a book you need someone to trust, someone to latch onto but it won't happen here. The beginning of the book was so slow, long and drawn out I almost put it down completely. Although some readers may not like the ending, I thought it was the best part of the book. I just wanted to be done with these people.
B009327P8G|5.0|This show (and TV series in general) is mindblowing. I'm suprised at every single episode and this one was no different. Can't wait for the next one :)
0684857219|4.0|I bought this book years ago when I was about 18 months into serious weight lifting. This text really changed the way I went about certain lifts as well as help me find motivation. It seemed after this book and I teamed up I recieved a lot of, \\"Wow, you got big.\\" or \\"Geez, you're a beast!\\" from my friends. Of course if you're into Bodybuilding, those are compliments. Now a days I am not going for the bulky look, just the slim, trim and athletic. This text is still referenced from time to time. For the price, can't beat it.

0345525558|4.0|Vanessa Diffenbaugh's THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS is a heart-wrenching, frustrating, enveloping piece of fiction. Though I alternated between wanting to slap Victoria and desperately needing to give her a hug, I found myself really caring about her -- and everyone in the story. For good or for ill, they were all up in my headspace for the week in which I tore through this story. And though I was emotionally spent by the end, I didn't want it to be over.<br /><br />Victoria is a pretty complicated character. On one side is this scared, rebellious, defiant girl -- this child who wants no one; no one who wants this child. When Victoria gets this one chance at having a family and categorically blows it, I felt unbelievably upset with her . . . just like her social worker, who plays a large role in young Victoria's life. But as the angry kid grows into a frightened and belligerent teen, we're given a glimpse at a very raw and vulnerable Victoria -- one no one really sees.<br /><br />Diffenbaugh was masterful in this way. Just when I wanted to write Victoria off, shake her or run from her or lecture her, she showed us a tender view of this 18-year-old misfit -- and how could I walk away from her then? She clearly needs help, and doesn't know how to get it. Having never really felt like she received or was worthy of love, how could she offer it to Grant? Her first instinct is always to run and ruin, and I kind of . . . understood that.<br /><br />Though the novel's \\"twists\\" weren't terribly shocking, I was too caught up in this fast-moving plot to care too much about its predictable turns. The author flips between present-day Victoria and her childhood, revealing the truth of what happened to rip her away from Elizabeth, Victoria's one-time hopeful adoptive mother. I liked the alternating chapters and thought the story was touching and heartbreaking. It made me think about how so few questions in life provide easy answers -- and that what we think we want often turns out to be so different than reality.<br /><br />The story didn't always go the way I wanted, and Victoria herself could be as annoying as she was endearing. But at the end of THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS, I was in her camp -- and ready to support her. Her character's growth was tremendous, and I chalk Diffenbaugh's excellent storytelling up to forming what would have otherwise been a sad, sad tale into one of hopeful redemption. It was heartwarming and raw and maybe not completely realistic, but who cares? I really liked it.so different than reality.<br /><br />The story didn't always go the way I wanted, and Victoria herself could be as annoying as she was endearing.

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I rented the Avengers to watch for a flight recently. It was worth it, the movie is good and the lead into the story is a good set up for the action and climax. I'm still not sure which Avenger I like the best but the Hulk is pretty awesome in this moview.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|The Marware Vibe Standing Case does exactly what it's supposed to - protects the Kindle Fire and allows you to use it as a stand either horizontally or vertically. I have no problem charging my Kindle in the Case with the buttons facing the \\"top\\" so the charger can be plugged into the right side. The Case itself is slim yet strong, not adding too much bulk. Also like the band that holds the Case closed-a simple, neat solution.

0399157565|4.0|I love it each year when the new Scarpetta novel comes out!  It always lives up to my expectations.  The beginning of the book finds Kay with an odd email.  (I always wonder why these emails get opened and make it past Lucy's firewall!)  A women has been killed and her ear cut off.  Marino is in trouble and implicated in the murder. What I loved about this book was the interaction between Kay and Benton as they work this case and worked through some personal issues.  I missed having  Marino in the book as his part was almost nonexsistant. The details of the forensics were a bit much and were way over my head.  Still, this is a terrific story and a must read for Scarpetta fans!
B004W4N55C|3.0|This was easily 4/5star territory until I started using it on Nexus 7, now it crashes regularly. Devs need to work on stability.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another excellent Reacher  adventure.  How many more States before he gets to Virginia? Should be worth a few more episodes.

B003N0XDT4|3.0|First off, the product was clearly made to pair with an ipod, iphone or other size phone or player.  For that purpose, it is a headphone amp only.  While that is a benefit when listening with a good set of headphones, it relies on the host device's onboard DAC and only amps the analog signal.  To use the E7's DAC, the input must be from the USB, which will be indicated on the display when working. When using this with a computer, whether from Itunes or another player, FLAC or Apple Lossless files sound much improved from the onboard sound cards that come standard with most computers.  But again, the E7 is compromised by the fact that it is processing at a 48kHz / 16-bit rate, less than the maximum 96kHz/24 bit rate of most other DAC devices.  Still I was satisfied using this with my Windows system on my laptop and a my AKG K701s.<br /><br />After three months of use, the right channel DAC went out.  As others have written, the warranty which requires you mail it back to China at a cost in excess of the sales price makes it worthless.  The E7 is so cheap by comparison, I thought about buying another, but instead, I got a NuForce icon which not only does a much better D/A conversion, but can work on my home stereo with RCA outputs.  I still have the E7 as a portable amp (both channels continue to work on that function).  The battery life is great and charging time is short.  My recommendation is if you want the E7 to use with a portable player or smartphone, save a few dollars and buy a portable amp only.  If you want a DAC for USB connection to a computer, go up to a better spec DAC and don't risk the poor build quality of this device.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|The CD was solid form beginning to end.  If you enjoy music form the American Song Book you will enjoy this CD.
0440244412|5.0|I have to say that I have read a couple of Moning's romance books, and I would NOT classify this series as a romance.  This book/series is SO MUCH MORE. Others have touched on plot, characters, etc, so I won't go over that again.<br /><br />I'm gonna be honest and say I didn't really enjoy the Highlander romance books Moning wrote. They are typical romance, if you are into that, which I am not.<br /><br />But I think Moning found her stride when she made the Fever world.  Stepping out of the romance-box, she has created an entire fantasy world within reality--for adults!! I personally enjoy many of the fantasy-type books (that suggest hidden aspects in reality, such as super-natural creatures, the world of Fairy, hidden powers, etc)that are written for young adults.  Moning has managed to create such a world while avoiding being cheesy or totally unbelievable.<br /><br />I greatly enjoy the tension/relationship between MacKayla and Barrons, and her interaction with other characters. Her personal journey and growth are believable. There is just the right amount of romantic sub-plot and no cringe-worthy sex scenes found in most novels that fall into the romance genre.  I have read this series 4 times, and will probably re-read it every year. I look forward to more books set in this world.<br /><br />Overall, I think with this series, Moning's genius began to flex, and she did an amazing job creating a world that I am always sad to leave at the end of the books.
B004UHPU5E|2.0|in my opinion this ain't crim. it ain't bad. it's kinda like fripp's other ambient work with vocals. if this is what you are looking for then buy it.
0385335997|5.0|This review is for the entire series. To those who rate it low b/c it is \\"too long\\"...did you not notice that before beginning it? To those who say there is too much sex...it IS technically classified as \\"romance\\"...skip the sex scenes, it won't take away from the story. To those who say there are inaccuracies (historical,factual)...it is a novel written for entertainment purposes with characters who are not all-knowing, not a history book for educational purposes.<br /><br />Ok.  When my husband first brought this book back with him from Iraq (donated to the USO)and he told me he was reading a historical-fiction/romance/fantasy/time travel book, I teased him.  I thought no way could such a book be an actual worthy read.<br /><br />I am a constant reader. I have to always have a book.  So, when I was in-between books, I picked up this book just to pass the time.  Don't make the same mistake I did..DO NOT be fooled by the genre. Don't make the mistake of thinking that these are typical bodice-ripping Highlander trash-romance...they are not. They are real literature.<br /><br />I do not enjoy romance novels, though I will read one if it is the only reading material available. I have to say that this series of books, though they do contain sex scenes, is NOT romance.  They are a complex tale full of an entire cast of well-developed characters.  I have been on the discussion boards that center around this series. Most of the women seem to be in love with (at least the idea of) the main male character, Jamie.  As proof of how good the story told and the writing in this book is, I need to say that the physical description of him (and some parts of his personality) are a complete turn-off to me.  He is pretty much the opposite of what I like. However, you don't need to be attracted to a character to enjoy reading about them and to grow to admire and care about them. The love story between Jamie and Claire is quite inspiring, so much so that my husband and I actually got matching tattoos inspired by the books.<br /><br />These stories are so well-written and in-depth, that I read them aloud to my children (simply not reading the child-inappropriate parts aloud) and all of them, from my 7-year-old daughter to my 18-year-old son, are as captivated as I am.<br /><br />These books weave the tale of well-developed, multifaceted characters, exploring their personal growth, interactions and relationships with one another, their people in their communities, and some well-known historical figures, all within the context of various historical time periods. From  Jacobite-era Scotland to pre-revolutionary North Carolina (and many places in between), you will follow a brilliantly-written, gripping saga and you will be a part of a world you won't want to leave.
B009CPEOC4|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented this. It had good reviews but since it covered a \\"tour\\" I wasn't sure how. I liked Katy Perry but now I love Katy Perry. She came across as very sincere and down to earth, a good role model. You were also able to see the strain the career caused in her life which is important so that kids who have the same goals can see it isn't easy.

0385344333|3.0|If I weren't already a fan of Jack Reacher  (Lee Child) this book wouldn't have done it.  I have read all the other books. Although the usual fun \\"super-human take over the world all by yourself\\" personality is still there--there is no clear Antagonist. No strong quest that compels you to  stay up all night and finish it. Nothing clear is at stake.  Child employees a vague  unexplained terrorist- threat that is never clearly defined seems no more than a \\"macguffin\\" to give an excuse for  staging  a typical Reacher take over with no clear purpose.  Two very nicely developed characters die but for what and the (SPOILER) death of the sheriff was beautifully written but I didn't care about the rest of it much--no clear plot.  I will probably buy the next one but this feels like it was phoned in--formulaic without a  point.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|All ages in our household enjoyed this movie.  I actually order this for my grand daughter.  But when I order it, I didn't realize that I was also going to receive a digital copy to view for 48 hours also.  So no only did my grand daughter get to enjoy it but my daughter and I as well.  This movie has a very good plot and we really enjoyed the music.  Dr. Seuss never let's me down.

B004EPYZXK|2.0|apollo 18 is a hard movie to follow. it was not well made but i still found it interesting. i think they need to remake this one. i beleive in this vast universe we cannot be alone and this movie in my opinion was not worth the price.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|UPDATED 4-20-14<br /><br />I've had this app for about a year and a half and it never lets me down.  I stand by it 100%!<br /><br />The most important feature I was looking for was AUTO-SNOOZE and this has it!  You don't have to touch your phone if you don't want to deal with the alarm right away.  I use it as a reminder to take my meds which I don't need to take exactly when the alarm goes off.  If I'm at an appointment, I can ignore it until I'm through etc.<br /><br />It is ultra customizable.  You can set the interval between snoozes, number of snoozes (or unlimited) etc.  IT WILL EVEN DECREASE INCREMENTALLY THE INTERVAL BETWEEN SNOOZES FOR A PARTICULAR ALARM.  For instance, the alarm sounds and then auto-snoozes at your custom time, say 5 seconds.  The next time the alarm sounds will coincide with the time you set, say, one minute less.  The next time, one minute less snoozing and so forth.  So if you initially started with \\"alarm sound for 5 seconds and then snooze for 20 minutes\\", it will snooze for twenty and sound again.  The next time it will snooze for 19 minutes, then 18 minutes etc. until it reaches one minute.  At that point the alarm will continue sounding every minute for 5 seconds.  Excellent!<br /><br />I'm a heavy sleeper and have always been difficult to awaken.  But this alarm is relentless!  I set it so that I need to be fully awake in order to be able to cancel the alarm.  That prevents me from falling back to sleep.  I wish I had this when I was going to grade school!<br /><br />This app naturally stays running in the background.  I have not had any problems with battery drainage.  I've tested several of these alarm apps and this is a keeper.<br /><br />The advanced settings are for the default alarm parameters.  If you want to change them for each alarm just go to advanced and do it.  If you want auto snooze you have to allow snooze and choose a method of activating the snooze.  That is, even though you are using auto-snooze you have to select, for instance, \\"use side buttons\\".  You won't need to use them but that's the way it's set up.<br /><br />To delete an alarm, press and hold the alarm listed to get the \\"right click\\" menu.  Take the time to explore this app and I'm sure you can get it to do what you need.<br /><br />The ads don't bother me as I'm usually not connected to the Net but I just might get the paid version to get rid of them and to stop the Net communication which it says will be disabled if you pay for it.  This app is worth every penny if you get the paid version!ct, for instance, \\"use side buttons\\".  You won't need to use them but that's the way it's set up.<br /><br />To delete an alarm, press and hold the alarm listed to get the \\"right click\\" menu.

B00005JKL8|5.0|behind enemy lines is a very,very good movie. espically since this really happened. if your the kind of person who likes reality movies? it doesn;t get more real than a true story that was very well acted. if you have not seen this movie you will not be left felt down after watching this one.
B002VH7P4O|4.0|I was 12 when I bought my first record, \\"Introducing The Beatles\\". I saw The Beatles live in San Diego on Aug. 28 1965. I bought every album and single they released. I was even lucky enough to buy an original \\"Butcher Cover- Yesterday and Today\\". Between \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" I got a stereo. So, I bought all of the albums again. Later, I was introduced to British imports, so I bought them all again, even \\"A Collection Of Beatle Oldies\\" along with a couple of German issues. Much later, I gave in and got a CD player, and guess what? I bought them all again. In 2004 the Capitol versions were released on CD which included the mono as well as stereo mixes. So I bought them. I also bought the singles box set and the EP box set. Then the stereo and mono boxes of the entire catalogue were released. Of course, I bought them. I also have \\"BBC\\", \\"Anthology\\", \\"Let It Be Naked\\", \\"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\\", \\"1\\", and anything else there is. Finally, I bought the USB Apple. So, now I am on my 10th trip or more through the mystery tour, and will buy the next edition when technology advances. I am one of many who prefer the mono mixes on most of the songs. If the USB contained mono, I would give it 5 stars. The only reasons I have for buying the USB are; I own everything else, and it's so cool. I don't have any regrets about contributing to Sir Paul's wealth, (as well as the rest of the industry). I can't imagine what my generation, or music today would be like without The Beatles!
B007HO392S|4.0|i never considered myself a \\"fan\\" but this album won me over.  her best effort so far, her voice has matured; i enjoyed singing along in my car.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After reading 50 Shades I was looking for what to read next and ever list I found said to read \\"Bared to You\\" which I did...which then lead me to read the next book in the series \\"Reflected in You\\".  I have to say most of Bared to You I didn't think was such a great book...I felt like the characters were not developed enough or for lack of a better way to describe it their relationship happened too fast without it being developed well in my opinion.  But as \\"Bared to You\\" went on I liked it better and towards the end I was invested in these two characters and really wanted to see what was next for them.  So then, of course, I wanted to read the next book in the series which was \\"Reflected in You\\".<br /><br />At that time it was not available in book form so I bought the Kindle for pc version (I don't have a kindle or another reader but realized I could download kindle to my pc and read).  Oh my gosh I am so glad I did because \\"Reflected in You\\" was so good.  It almost has a bit of a thriller aspect to it.  If you are looking for BDSM it doesn't have a lot of that but does have a lot of erotic scenes.  The storyline is so good in this book you will be wanting more but you will be as disappointed as I was to find the next book in the series not available yet.  Oh that makes me crazy.  I want to finish a whole series instead of moving on to another series and then back to this series when the next book comes out.  Soon I will be confusing my characters.  So I guess when she finally comes out with the last one I will probably have to go back and reread \\"Bared to You\\" and \\"Reflected in You\\" just to refresh myself on the characters again.<br /><br />Definitely read \\"Bared to You\\" first..then move on to \\"Reflected in You\\".  When I finished \\"Reflected in You\\", since \\"Entwined with You\\" was not released, I went on to read \\"If I Were You\\" by Lisa Renee Jones.  \\"If I Were You\\" is probably the best book I have read so far out of the 50 shades genre (but again the follow up books in that series are not ready yet..so I'm stuck finding another series lol)

B008U7ZPHS|5.0|the Mark of Athena is another book from Rick Riordan who deserves 5 stars.<br />if you are looking for a book that gives you an adventure and makes you laugh, cry and smile this is the book.<br />whats great is that the book includes lots of Greek / Roman facts so that you can lecture your friends when they are wrong.<br />its real fun to prove your friends wrong and know random stuff you can use in a conversation later.<br /><br />if you like books like the Golden compass and Eragon you should read the previous series Percy jackson and then this.

0525952616|5.0|I can't think of a writer working today who blends thrills with technology better than Daniel Suarez.  He demonstrated his prowess in this regard in his first two books - \\"Daemon\\" and \\"Freedom TM\\" -- and in \\"Kill Decision\\" he picked up right where he left off.  It's a difficult book to put down.  A thrill ride.  And if that were all it was, if that was the sum total of \\"Kill Decision,\\" it would be a success.  There would be nothing wrong with that.  Plenty of terrific books are little more than thrill rides.  But there's so much more to this book and to Mr. Suarez's writing.  He actually has important things to say in every one of his books.  And he says them in a way that keeps his readers on the edges of their seats.  Like his first two books, \\"Kill Decision\\" is as smart a book as you will find.  Mr. Suarez takes real and important issues and shines a light onto them, using pulse-racing action and cutting edge technology.  After I read one of his books, I walk away having learned more than a few things.  And, better yet, these lessons come wrapped in an exciting read.  \\"Kill Decision\\" is as chilling as it is thrilling.  Can't wait for Mr. Suarez's next book.

B007UPNA6Y|4.0|If you have read Lee Childs previous Jack Reacher novels, then you know exactly what to expect.  You will not be disappointed even though you will probably not get many surprises either.  It's not the best 'Reacher' story but its as comfortable as an old shoe. Simply put - its good versus bad.  Reacher is the man we would all like to be.  Honourable, unburdened, strong, loyal. The book is an easy read but if you have never read any 'Reachers' before - I advise you to start at the beginning and I envy you because you will love them.

B008MG1E4A|2.0|Poorly written and not much we didn't already know.  The reader is left with a \\"why are you telling this?\\" feeling that's hard to overcome.  Lots of macho swagger and self aggrandizing, not to mention a violation of an oath of duty.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in you is an excellent read, full of suspence at every turn. You will never be able to predict any of the events therein.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|In a land long ago and far away, cliffhangers were usually reserved for the end of a t.v. season. Now, i find myself hopelessly addicted to not only T.V. shows, but books that come in a series. I read \\"Bared to You\\" after becoming embarrassed about how many times I had read and reread the 'Fifty' series. Soon, I had a new addiction. i don't know how many times I read \\"Bared to You\\" but it was more times than I care to admit and I finally gave the book to a friend to read to get it out of my house. That's how much i began to care about Gideon and Eva and how much i enjoyed Sylvia Day's writing. Her attention to detail, and her placement of the story in Manhattan, full of the lifestyle of the rich and famous who go to those restaurants we only dream about and ride around in private limousines while we are schlepping to the bus stop with all our packages, forms the basis for great escape reading of good quality.<br />So, I got addicted to the story of two damaged people who stumble across each other and fall in love. And, what a love it is, full of steamy passion and a real hunger to understand each other. I could not wait until \\"Reflected in You\\" was released and actually pre-ordered it for my Kindle, something I had never done before. At 1 in the morning on October 2nd, I saw the  notification that Gideon and Eva had arrived on my Kindle and by the end of October 2nd, I had already finished the book and started re-reading it to see what nuances I had missed. Sylvia Day has quite an ear for dialogue and for the angst that comes with insecurities caused by various forms of abuse. The three main characters have all suffered in their childhoods and bear the scars in their adult attempts at relationships. The book opens with Eva attempting to help her best friend deal with his need to undermine any healthy relationship he might have, and to deal with her tenuous relationship with Gideon at the same time. The roller coaster ride that is \\"Reflected in You\\" deals with the good and bad passions that arise between and around these people.<br />Day develops the story well, and we learn more about the characters and their motivations. Some frustrating questions remain that even my relentless rereading does not uncover. Why doesn't anyone tell Eva when she is clearly in danger? Whose lipstick was on Gideon's shirt and why won't he be honest? I am hoping and praying that I get some more clarification in book three, which, I am told, may not arrive in Kindle-Land on December 31st, as promised. I am really looking forward to the resolution of this cliff-hanger, even though I know that Gideon does not move through this world like normal people do, and that after a night or weekend of sheet-clawing, screaming sex, they are likely to break up yet again and find their way back to each other. I love these characters, and I feel connected to them, even though my life does not resemble theirs at all. Perhaps that is Sylvia Day's special gift. She has created people whom I find myself genuinely rooting for and caring about and so i read and re-read, looking for possible clues I might have missed. What better fantasy than gorgeous, sexy,  wealthy people who struggle mightily for happiness? Hurry up book three..........

B0067EKY9K|4.0|Some movies are written off because of their titles and it takes a while for them to gain an audience. Few people knew what The Shawshank Redemption was before it was released on VHS. Another confusing title is The World's Fastest Indian? Is it about an athlete of some kind? While other movies, such as Freedom Writers and The Reader, simply sound boring. Salmon Fishing in the Yemen is in danger of being dismissed due to its title, but that would be a mistake.<br /><br />Dr. Alfred Jones (Ewan McGregor) is a fisheries expert, and he seems like a boring man. His existence is dull and safe. His relationship with his wife is one of mutual tolerance, and they do not share the same passions. He only drinks alcohol on the weekend, and only after 7pm. Nobody takes him seriously at work either, so he has little to look forward to.<br /><br />Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked) is a keen fisherman, but that's not an easy hobby to satisfy when you are surrounded by sand. He recruits a team to investigate the possibility of building a river in the desert, and populating it with salmon, so that he can pursue his passion for fishing. Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt) is given the task of recruiting Jones and anyone or anything else that might be needed to complete the project. She's in a new relationship and loves a soldier, but that is put on hold when he is called up for duty.<br /><br />The movie is heavily influenced by romance. Harriet is in a hopeful new relationship, Jones is in a tired marriage, and could there even be the possibility of romance between the two with them working so closely together? The other main element is humor. The largely British cast influences the tone, and the humor is more subtle and understated than in typical North American comedies. I found myself smiling often, rather than laughing out loud. Most of the laughs come at the expense of Jones, who is set in his routines and is a quirky individual.<br /><br />Jones doesn't treat the project seriously because it sounds so ludicrous, but his outlook changes when he meets Sheikh Muhammed, who is one of the most likable characters in the movie.<br /><br />Blunt is not a typical beauty, but she's a good actress. I was impressed with her performances in Sunshine Cleaning and The Adjustment Bureau, and she's just as effective in this movie. She has a certain warmth and vulnerability that works well for a romantic lead. McGregor most recently caught my attention in The Ghost Writer, and he plays Jones perfectly.<br /><br />However, the movie is more than a romantic comedy. The two leads are required to pull off several emotional scenes, especially in the final act.<br /><br />One character who elicits laughs in every scene in which she appears is Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), who plays the British Prime Minister's aide. She's the main villain in the story and is always out to manipulate the situation in order to gain votes and positive mentions in the newspapers.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure who the movie is aimed at, but it worked for me. It won't change your life with a dramatic message that you've never seen before, but it's an enjoyable place to visit for a while.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is strong and the desert scenes look particularly impressive. Special features are sparse and total just over 16 minutes.<br /><br />Overall score 3.75/5because it sounds so ludicrous, but his outlook changes when he meets Sheikh Muhammed, who is one of the most likable characters in the movie.<br /><br />Blunt is not a typical beauty, but she's a good actress.

0743297334|4.0|In The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway describes aimless, jaded and wounded characters and their efforts to numb these feelings of emptiness by leading idle lives of excess.  Hemingway's great talent is that he shows these complicated emotions with his classic clean and simple writing style.<br /><br />There are endless back and forth exchanges between the narrator Jake Barnes, Robert Cohn, Lady Brett Ashley, Mike Campbell and the people they meet in Paris and in Pamplona.  Hemingway tells his story through these seemingly insignificant conversations and Jake's narration where we discover important things about each character.  We learn how Jake is still struggling to accept his war injury and understand his relationship with Brett.  We see how Robert Cohn becomes more and more shunned as he pursues Brett.  And with every one of Brett's reckless relationships with the men who surround her, particularly Mike and the bullfighter Pedro Romero, we discover her own feelings of a lost life.<br /><br />I particularly liked how Hemingway took his description of Cohn on the very first page of the book and directly tied it to Cohn's exploding temper in Pamplona.  I saw hope in Jake's bitter-sweet relationship with Brett despite the overwhelmingly hopeless theme of the story.

B0038NN3B4|5.0|This book, written by real scientists and doctors at Johns Hopkins University explains clearly how Atkins works. Why a high-protein diet gets you off the sugar cycle. I'm 70 and was hitting 230 (6\\"1\\" with a 46-inch waistline). In 15 days, I've lost nearly 10 pounds, body fat down from 31.5% to 27%, and waistline down to 44 inches.<br /><br />The Atkins snacks actually taste good and I'm having no trouble eating big salads, eggs, bacon, turkey, pork, beef. The diet is based on a core vegetable diet (lots of them) and protein foods. I made an egg pizza with a couple of eggs (scrambled in a bowl), poured into a round pan, covered with pepperoni slices and green pepper and, of course, cheese. Pretty good. I eat big salads every day and don't worry about too much salad dressing. I always cook in olive oil, which the book recommends. So far I have way more energy, concentrate better. Clearly, too much sugar in my previous diet was a problem for me. The great thing is that Atkins is no longer a crash diet. Instead it is a three-stage change in your diet: Induction (where you get about 20 g of carbs, OWL (ongoing weight loss) where you work in some more carbs to vary the diet while still losing weight, and Maintenance which is a long-term eating habit where you find the carb level you can eat and still maintain your weight.<br /><br />Atkins is now being used for treatment of several diseases, including diabetes. Johns Hopkins medical school has a department focusing on the Adkins diet. This is real and based on real science. The book cites research papers that back up the concepts. It lowers your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is really good for you. Once you get off the sugar roller-coaster, you have more energy (burning a gram of fat produces more energy than a gram of sugar produces). And best of all, when I get hungry, I eat. Three meals and two snacks. If you're hungry, you're not eating enough. Eat more protein. Try a Hebrew National hot dog on a stalk of celery with a little mustard. This is really good (my invention).<br /><br />If you're overweight, diabetic, or maybe even chronically fatigued, you might give this book a read and try this regimen. I'm pretty sure you'll be happy you did.lery with a little mustard.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|The first book in this series was pretty good, especially after reading Fifty Shades when everyone was looking for something similar to read, but the second one was pretty much all sex. i never thought i'd say this but it was TOO MUCH sex! a book needs more than just that!

B006LSZECO|1.0|I could not wait to finish this book--only did so because it was our book club selection. The characters ( except the police personnel) were all in various stages of psychosis and I do not enjoy spending my time in that milieu. The other annoyance for me was the somewhat gratuitous overuse of profanity--perhaps I am too discriminating but I got no personal benefit from this experience. I do acknowledge the literary skill of the author but would like to see her talent put to better use.

B007GCY8FS|4.0|Exciting and easy read.  Lee Child is great at giving you a small taste of excitement and keeping you interested in finding where the book will carry you.  Jack Reacher is always calm, quick witted, and an interesting character who is also humanized by Child to make mistakes, but never the same one twice.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recently downloaded this app on the recommendation of a friend, and couldn't be happier. Free, multiple Bible versions and some in audio. Highly recommend.[[ASIN:B004MC8CA2 Bible]]
B0073XORCY|3.0|I have most Tulls Cd's and have seen him in concert 3 times, I was disappointed with this, I thought this would be an extension of the first Thick as a Brick, but the music was no match.
B005HSL626|1.0|I love this game, i have it on my ipod touch, but it always crashes on my android, motorola bionic. :(
B007J4T2G8|3.0|After all the hype, I had to read this book.  The story was good, but like most fiction,  very unrealistic - exactly the escape you need on a rainy weekend.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Call of Atlantis is a great game! It is very much like Bejeweled but with a storyline. While it had some tough points, it was fairly easy. I do wish it had more levels or even other difficulty levels (like if we finish the game, it unlocks the medium and then hard difficulty levels). Overall, I think the game is an excellent purchase!
B006LSZECO|3.0|So so plot.  Didn't find the book that entertaining. You might.  Who am I to say what tickles your fancy.  Got to go.  Hope that's 20 word.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Addictive book. Loved the entire thing. Had me on edge about her choice the entire book, and left me eager for her next book to come out!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I have read \\"The Diary of Anne Frank\\" and did not know what to expect when I started reading this.  I had a friend recommend this book to me.  I have to thank her.  I often read young people's books, as I have a Wonderful Granddaughter that loves to read and I like to read books to recommend to her.<br />I will end up giving her my book and recommending that she read it.  I will tell her that it is disturbing and sad, but it is worth the time and effort.  I will also tell her she needs to read Anne Frank's book also.  Maybe that one first to help her understand this one.  It gives you another perspective of the times and life these people lived through.<br />A good read.  Very thought provokingly.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is quite addicting.  Decent game of logic for all ages. Its definitely one of my go to games.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Trilogy has been a joy to read....I am actually going slow on this Last one because I know this is the end of the Story until the Fabulous Movie hits the Big Screen!!!
B008133DO8|5.0|This is an awesome series! Season 2 outdid the first - A Scandal in Belgravia was the most entertaining TV I've seen in a long time!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Such a good book, I couldn't put them down! I hope the movie is just as good as the books!
B008G8SFGO|1.0|This record just didn't do it for me, I didn't enjoy a single cut off of this.  Got trite and boring after the first listen.  It's over produced, self-indulgent and has the in-it-for-the-money sound to it.
B005HEX1AK|2.0|A previous reviewer compared `Shattered' to a clip show and it's a dead on association. Voyager runs into its billionth anomaly (these things take up a massive amount of residential space in the Delta quadrant) and it fractures sections of the ship into different time periods in its history. It's up to Chakotay and Year One Janeway to put everything back together again.<br /><br />By utilizing this \\"shattered\\" time structure, we get to see different moments from Voyager's seven-year journey. It comes across as an interactive clip show for Beltran and Mulgrew, as the former explains everything that is going to happen to the latter with living examples.<br /><br />You would think this would be interesting, but it's just as boring as a regular clip show. If anything, `Shattered' makes things even more frustrating for the show as you get to see past events that never developed anywhere (the Maquis being the biggest). Also, you get a reset button at the end, so everything feels pointless by the time the credits role.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Jeri Ryan in full Borg gear one last time. It looks uncomfortable as hell, but she looks fresh in it.<br /><br />- Some of Janeway's rejoinders to future events seem to almost reflect fan reactions.<br /><br />- The brief appearance of future Naomi and Icheb. Looking good kids.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- If you would like to explore any of the great moments seen in this episode, Star Trek Voyager is available on DVD and Amazon Instant Video!
0439023521|5.0|After all the great reviews this series is getting, I hardly have anything worthy of a lengthy speech, so I'll just make it quick.<br /><br />I couldn't put the first book down once I got started, and I managed to get the other two before I finished the first one. I've read all three, and all I can say is, when are they making the next movie?<br /><br />I also must say that the third book was a bit disappointing to me, and I won't go into any detail in respect for those who have not yet read it. But all in all, the first movie tracked the book pretty well, and the acting was over the top. Bring on the next one!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|This season will blow your mind. Gemma and Clay are two people I would like to meet up with when I'm feeling not so friendly. Love Sam Cro

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I loved this movie, seeing it again on my kindle fire was almost as good as when I saw it in the theaters.
159420411X|3.0|Mr. Silver's book has some terrific yarns, which illustrate his insider's passion for baseball, chess, poker, the stock market, and more. Overall the writing here is very lively, and the book is entertaining and wise in many ways.  But there are several problems, I think.<br /><br />Let me start with the dull subject of statistics.  Mr. Silver explains the basics nicely, including the distinctions between accuracy, precision, false positives and negatives, Bayesian logic, and predictions, with lovely examples that deepened my own understanding of these old concepts.  (As a public health guy myself, I often forget that these ideas, which get to be second nature for statisticians and epidemiologists like me, are new for many folks, and can be counter-intuitive).<br /><br />The chapters on baseball, chess, and poker are great fun, and serve to illustrate these statistical principles admirably.<br /><br />But then there are some important problems further along.<br /><br />First, I was surprised by Silver's quirky use of the parable of the fox and the hedgehog.  (The parable, frankly, gets threadbare by the end of its chapter.)  Most writers who invoke this parable end up disparaging the fox and admiring the hedgehog, rather than the reverse as Silver does. Why?  Because -- in the usual telling of the parable the fox is clever, but flighty and ultimately unsuccessful, whereas the plodding old hedgehog, who knows only one true thing (to roll into a ball for protection), applies that one thing successfully.  And so, the parable is usually seen as ironic meta-wisdom, with a moral lesson nearly opposite from the one Silver draws.  Still, of course, new authors can use old stories for new purposes.<br /><br />In four other areas, however I had greater difficulty with the discussion:<br /><br />1) I disliked his discussion of the causes and course of the current financial crisis, where I believe Silver gets a number of basic facts about the economy and the course of unemployment flat-out wrong, and certainly adopts an economic viewpoint that many fine economists would disagree with.<br /><br />2) His discussion of America's campaign for influenza immunization is simply dreadful, and is, frankly, insulting to the terrific public health professionals who wrestled with the exact same questions Silver raises, but at much greater depth.  I found it disgraceful to read Silver's simplistic Monday-morning quarterbacking of these difficult public policy decisions, as if somehow history would have turned out so much better, if only America's poor misguided public health pros had been as smart as Nate.  Oh, please.<br /><br />3) The discussion of global climate change was similarly very unsatisfying.  Once again, the tone in this comes across as condescending - what a shame that all of these well intentioned but simplistic climate scientists at IPCC and elsewhere just didn't appreciate Nate's deep insights into predictions.  (Yeah, right.)<br /><br />4) The discussion about former Defense Secretary Rumsfeld's views on defense uncertainties is lively and interesting, but it also ignores an important part of the historical record.  Let's be very clear, Mr Silver:  there were NO weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and the evidence is very strong that the Bush administration lied America into that war.  Your glossing over of those facts with two or three vague paragraphs about uncertainty in the intelligence community just don't cut it.  Uncertainty among public officials is one thing; frank dishonesty is another.<br /><br />I thought a long time about why his chapters on global climate change, America's response to terrorism, and Wall Street transactions seemed so far off the rails, when the rest of the book is quite insightful.<br /><br />Here, I think, is the logical flaw in these less successful chapters:  In fact, some people lie shamelessly.  Throughout most of the book, Silver assumes that competing prognosticators will generally be governed by a basic sense of honesty and good will.  (Yes, I understand that there are prognosticators whose purpose is publicity, or controversy for its own sake, like the McLaughlin Group which gets a gentle skewering from Silver.)  But even in these divergent cases, we assume that the non-linear forces that move public opinion are driven by basic honesty and truth, even if belatedly.<br /><br />But what happens when this presupposition of basic honesty in the participants is not met?  What if some of the participants are lying actively?  Do the same rules apply?  Well, no.  And that's precisely what I would argue has happened in the two spheres of global climate change and financial transactions, where players entered the arena who were fundamentally dishonest.  (Readers who don't already agree that Fox News and the Wall Street Journal routinely lie for political or financial gain should perhaps stop reading right now.)  But indeed, there are such players who lie. Not that I would see all climate \\"deniers\\" as other than upright and honest seekers, but plenty are provably not.<br /><br />So, for the future, I predict we'll need a new chapter in another book, which I hope Silver will write:  how does blatant dishonesty alter the landscape, and where do prevaricators fit into this otherwise great framework?<br /><br />On balance, I'm glad I read the book, but I hope readers will make their way through it carefully.  Finally, let me put in a plug for Mr. Silver's unbelievably great blog about political forecasting, in the New York Times: FiveThirtyEight.com.  It is wonderful.
B006H5120E|4.0|Titanic 3D is a beautiful Blu Ray 3D set (which includes 2D as well as a digital copy). I wasn't sure if the 3D would be \\"cheesey,\\" but it is well done ... a nice addition to the already enjoyable movie. 3d comes in and out (not all scenes or evrything in each scene), but it's enough so that it really jumps out at you and you do feel as if you \\"are there.\\" Price is decent. I'd definitely recommend adding this to your collection!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the way the writer ended the series.  I couldn't stop reading this book. After reading the last word in this book,   I couldn't get the characters off my mind.  I have found my new favorite book!
0486409511|4.0|I have been slowly going through the lessons, so I haven't cimpleted the entire book. What I have done is very easy to follow with excellent examples of the proper forms for making the letters as well as examples of improper letter forms. I would have loved it if the book included a ruled line page for copying and using as guidelines under your parchment. A parchment pack I purchased previously contained a guideline page that I am luckly enough to use. Creating your own guidelines as the author states is tedious, but some may enjoy.
B000XR4OC0|2.0|When I was in Athens last year I bought a pair of Fullah Sugah jeans canvas shoes.  I paid 11 euros.  Recently I bought a pair of Toms canvas shoes for about $45 - more than twice the cost of the others.  When I received my Toms shoes I discovered that, except for the name on the sole of the shoe, they are IDENTICAL.  The stitching is the same, the lining is the same, the outer sole is the same.  Now I feel so amazingly ripped off.  They are so obviously made by the same manufacturer with just the Toms shoes label slapped on.  At this point, no matter how comfortable they are, I doubt I'll ever pay the inflated price for another pair of Toms shoes.  I'll just send a check to a charity instead.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|This controller is fantastic and of course, Gameloft has a great library of games, BUT...it does not work with all games advertised that it's supposed to right now.  Modern Combat 3 does not work and neither does several others.  However; it works fantastic with N.O.V.A. 3 and Asphalt 7!  Realistic gameplay makes for a nice distraction at the office at times.  Highly recommend, just needs compatibility with more games and it will be a winner!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|man this game is bolls this is just cool you need to get it you will loveee it!!!! get it know my sister always plays with it so get IT!!!!!!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Good flow, good action, good at the vernacular. I am impressed with his output and look forward to his book releases(which I gobble up gleefully).  I recommend for the beach palapa or the rainy day with cat couch spot. fun fun fun, good visualization, gratuitous tie ins to back stories, fun with dialogue - see Echo.<br />Recommended.
B0086700CM|1.0|I worked so hard to get 5000 credits on that game to get a background and it never gave me it
B008U7ZPHS|3.0|I have been a fan of riordans work for a long time, but I think the storyline has become overused and predictable. I was never surprised, and this time I wasn't left wanting more.<br />But it is still an okay read, especially for big fans.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|All Angry Birds versions have been challenging and entertaining. Really look forward to each new version. Keep up the good work.  Thanks.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Sane approach to complete workout, diet, and rest to get lean.  Manageable workouts even with a business lifestyle with real measurable results.  Lots of support material to properly perform exercises for best results, no nonsense advice on supplements, even recipes.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was even better than the first one by her.  I loved it and cannot wait for next one. If liked this one should also read the Christian Grey series.  Both series were awesome.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Well, the story continues, but I found Gideon slightly frustrating! Mood swings were a little more frequent, yet you still see the tender side he has when it comes to Eva... plot twist toward the end, even though at first I thought was a little predictable, but Gideon making out that he had left Eva just was frustrating... all made sense in the end. Can't wait for the next book to see what happens next! overall I loved it, was a real page turner.
B00136NVH4|5.0|Meatloaf is my all time favorite artist, and Bat out of Hell is one of my favorite albums!  I love every track on the album.  I saw Meatloaf in concert 3-4 times.  If you have a chance to see him, do it, he puts on a great show!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie. Actors I don't particularly like did a fantastic job, music was great; overall the movie took me back to watching this very show in London. I would highly recommend this movie to others.
B0073COMKW|5.0|Brighter than the 60W(13w) CFLs they replaced - nice natural warm white light (unlike yellow light of CFL's) - instant on - completely silent operation - after 12 hrs. of continuous operation still good - 18 yrs.? - we'll see.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is an awesome addition to the series. The sequel had me going for a long time, and my parents scolded me and told me to stop reading. I hope all ends well for Percy & Co. Come out with a new book quick because I literally can't find that many more series to read.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|Shipping took longer than expected. Was not sellers fault, was due to USPS shipping it to the wrong town. When arrived, everything was intact and packaged well. Cosmetics - DVDS perfect! Case - two minor wears on either corner. expected though! over all it was a easy no hassle order other than the shipping. Would buy from again in the the future! Thanks!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I think this game has nice background music and pretty graphics and is enjoyable to play. I like it even better since it was faotd:)
B008HOR7VQ|4.0|New album, similar musical direction that precedent works (means \\"So Far Away\\" from Dire Straits)... just enjoy it! (specially the harmonica).
B0090EIC3Y|1.0|While I had somewhat enjoyed his previous  movies this one had very few laughs and was mostly flat.  I wish I had that 2 hours of my life back.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Google Play Ok, but Amazon sucks! I emailed developer, but no response yet.<br /><br />New version has holo theme. Amazon users are still stuck with old version.
B006P0FD4W|2.0|This installment gets an A+ for cleverness but a C for scares.<br /><br />What made PA2 so good was that although it was a Hollywood cash-grab sequel, it carefully built on the minimalist scares of the original, while building the mythology. I actually like the sequel more than the original.<br /><br />Part 3 is just as clever in its construction as Part 2, and I'm grateful to the filmmakers for giving us what we **remember** VHS looking like, not what it **actually** looks like!<br /><br />But the problem with PA 3 is that it's more \\"hollywood\\" than #2 was, making the unknown horror of the first two films into something closer to a \\"franchise monster\\" like Freddy Kreuger or Chucky. We now know roughly the size and shape of \\"IT\\", we know what \\"IT\\" sounds like,  \\"IT\\" now has a name and, as we see, an origin of sorts.<br /><br />#3 also suffers from Hollywood sequel-itis. For example, if pots and pans falling on a kitchen floor was scary, then the entire contents of a kitchen falling is scarier, right? Right? Nope.<br /><br />Another Hollywoodism: Anything for a scare. Even if it doesn't fit, or make sense with what we already know.<br /><br />And then there's the standard \\"They definitely know they're in danger but stay anyway,\\" which worked under the circumstances of Part One but makes no sense here, especially with the kids in danger. If you sat and watched videos of your kid being pushed around by an invisible monster, you probably wouldn't have her sleep in the same room that night. Probably...<br /><br />So, ultimately, I guess I'm glad I know the whole story (or as much as I need to know). But if you're on the fence as I was, fearing a letdown after the first two, my advice is quite while you're ahead and don't see it.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book drug on and on and on. It did get better towards the end, but not enough sex, and it really made zero sense. My best friend agreed. Hope the 3rd one is worth the 9.99. This one really wasn't.
B004X4QW42|5.0|I absolutely love Donnie Yen.... IP Man 1 and IP Man 2 are both GREAT kung-fu movies.  My husband and I are HUGE martial art movie junkies... I recommend IP Man to EVERYONE!!! The story line is great, and the fighting....oooohhhh soooo good!!!
8866131369|5.0|This is the best  to- do calendar book I've had. I love Moleskin, I never leave the country without one.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I'm in love with this crossfire series! Can't wait till the next book comes out! Keep em coming! Awesome author that keeps you on your toes and constantly keeping your mind going. I couldn't put this book down!
B005BLYSQK|5.0|This bargain-priced set includes 7 discs covering all the complete sonatas along with a few unfinished sonatas and fragments.  Two more discs cover the Impromptus, the three pieces from D946, the Moments musicaux, and several shorter pieces.  The performances throughout are first-rate, though not to be preferred to some other available recordings (Brendel, Lupu, Uchida).  Some of the material in the early fragments is not quite as interesting as the later sonatas.  The recorded sound for the sonatas (Discs 1-7) is also not ideal though the sound in the last two discs is excellent.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|but then it started deleting my playlists, then it started taking forever to load a video and then it just stopped working completely.... so not worth the hassel!-
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. I love the little monster and everything!!!! I think you will love this also. this game rpcks
B007THA4FI|5.0|First, let me state that this is NOT a book for children!!!<br /><br />I didn't read any of the Harry Potter books, my grandchildren did.  I watched the movies when they came on tv with my grandchildren and was very impressed with Ms. Rowland's imagination for writing such entertaining material!<br /><br />When \\"The Casual Vacancy\\" was offered I bought it, as the description of her book intrigued my interest. I was not disappointed!<br /><br />What an imagination she has! From the town the book setting is in to the characters to the story line. I am almost through with the book.  Cannot put it down.<br /><br />I hope Ms. Rowling writes another. She has a new fan.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book gave not just a good insight into what it takes to become a sniper, but also an excellent thumb nail sketch of what becoming a SEAL is like. He also gives us a look at what these patriots are forced to give up to continue to defend this country. The choice between country and family would test the likes of King Solomon. As a Vietnam vet I highly recommend this book.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|With seven teenaged Demi-gods trying to get along, the story was a bit slow at the beginning but ended with a Big Bang! Very shocking cliff hanger.
0307749606|5.0|#17 and still going strong.  Never disappointing and what can I say, who doesn't love Reacher?  His wit, intelligence and brute strength are not to be messed with. Dick Hill's narrative keeps your attention and is very entertaining.  I can't wait for the first Reacher movie and hope the casting is perfect.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This was an excellent series. We do not have cable TV and can not wait until season II is released.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I cant stop raving about this book. I am ready to read the rest of the series right away. First of all, Lauren Oliver writing is outstanding. I was transported, dazzled and hooked with every word. The main theme of this book revolves around a world where society controls its people by taking love away and declaring it a disease. A cure comes in the form of a procedure that everyone goes through at age of 18. Teens and adults alike will be attracted to the idea of this idyllic emotion gone awry. If love is the core of human relationships, can you have a society of indifference, of autotrons?
B003O86FMW|4.0|Can't wait to read the others. Now I hope they make another movie to go along with it. I would <br />Love to see it..
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I have watched the Craig Ferguson show for a few years, and wanted to pick up this book for some quick laughs. I was not in anyway prepared for the depths of emotion and sincerity  Craig put in this book I highly recommend this for everyone
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Great story, good pacing, unexpected twists and turns (I won't spoil any here, but anyone can die), and loads of detail make for a great way to spend a few nights. A modern Tolkien with a better grasp on how to twist a reader‘s expectations
0316228532|3.0|The Casual Vacancy is filled with, and told from the point of view, of many different characters from the small town of Pagford. Somehow with the number and variety of characters we are introduced to I can honestly say (aside from a few moments here and there) there was not one single character I liked. The citizens of this town from young to old were for the most part unlikable, petty and obnoxious to name a flaws. It is is a testament to the writer that despite this I continued to read this novel and see it through. The novel goes on and on cycling through the character chronicling the events in the town following the death of Barry Fairbrother and up to and after the election to fill his vacant council spot. The entire book I was expecting it to build to a big finish, which it did for the most part. This was full of social and political commentary told through the events in a seemingly normal small town. Worth the read and shows Rowling's talent in that despite being known for and spending so much time living in and building a world that is now so well know she is able to go in a completely different direction and write something so different.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|Very good cg movie that has a very RE4 feel to it. The movie follows the story line very well (past actions from games show, ie Leon is still mad at Ada.)
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am 100% addicted to these books since reading fifty Shades!  Love Bared to You and Reflected in You even better than Fifty!  Can't wait for the 3rd book!!!
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I am an avid Muse fan which could create a bias for this review, however i thought it was a very good album and had some new sounds but really great songs.  Panic Station, Animals, and Supremacy are the best songs on the album by far.
B008H6GH8I|4.0|I went into watching this blind, trying to know as little as possible so I could just watch and enjoy. At first, I felt like I didn't like, or care, where the story was going but the further I watched the more interested I got. Also, the last 30 minutes or so makes the whole trip worthwhile. Don't want to spoil it at all, but it's something we haven't really seen much of in Resident Evil cannon but I think we all wish we did. (hint.. B.O.W. throwdown)<br /><br />But anyway, the atmosphere of this movie feels like recent Resident Evil games, taking place in a eastern European war zone with B.O.W.s in the mix, and includes RE main characters Leon and Ada. Ada, as usual, is running around in the background helping Leon while looking out for herself as well. Also there are B.O.W.s from RE 2 and RE 4. Leon's probably my least favorite character from numbered Resident Evil games but it didn't take away from enjoying the movie.<br /><br />Like I said I don't want to give any story away, because taking anything out of context of the way it's presented just sounds odd but when you watch the movie, it all makes sense in the end; and the end is totally worth the time spent. Also, if you're any kind of fan of Resident Evil, you shouldn't even be questioning getting this. Buy, watch, enjoy. Then go get Resident Evil 6 if you haven't already.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I thought it was a good read  though it was not one of Lee Child's better Jack Reacher  books  I still enjoy Jack Reacher very much but found with this book I could put down and not be itching to get back for a read
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Wow. Riordan really out did himself with this book. I cant wait for the next book. Hopefully he wont make us suffer
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|New favorite album :) Great songs, great voices, and great lyrics! I highly recommend getting this CD, especially for this price!  It's worth it.  Can't wait for the next one!!! <3
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i have followed the Percy Jackson Series all the way and he keeps coming up new items to that more than half the time you didnt except unless he told you about the book coming up.this one had a surprise ending i really didnt see coming..Overall it was a good book and if you have read all other of his books than read this one
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really love this app.  I take notes and keep lists and instead of scraps of paper that I am always losing I have my notes at my fingertips. They sync between my devices and are backed up automatically.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|Good adventure flick for all ages and fun for everyone. The price is good for a Blu ray<br />Now a days
B008XG1X18|5.0|I could not WAIT till Pinterest got its own app. On my kindle fire, its cooler to pin and view diff photos, almost like I made my own magazine. Pinning is easier too. On my laptop, it took opening a new tab and backtracking to pin photos. On the kindle, u just share and pin, even from other apps. Finger scrolling thru Pinterest is more of what the site was made for then time wasting on a laptop screen.
B008X77K8W|3.0|Chris Knight's latest offering is more country than his other albums, but the more I listen to it, the more I like it.  Favorite track is Hard Edges. Great tune.  The rest is growing on me.  Good stuff!
6305882592|5.0|I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE SINCE I FIRST SAW IT. IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU COULD WANT IN A MOVIE.
B000IZA9OE|5.0|If you are a fan of South Park this is a must have addition to your collection, regardless if you've seen it on TV or not as it is a lot better without commercials! I only wish they'd make another South Park movie!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I LOVE this book! I need more of Eva and Cross! I honestly think this series is better than 50 Shades of Grey. Silvia Day needs to keep them coming!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love games like these. This one has very nice colors and the puzzles change shape making it more difficult.
1568363931|5.0|I am so pleased with this book, though I don't have much time for packing lunches -- I prefer to multiply the ingredients and serve especially the Japanese menus for dinner and then use the leftovers for a bento lunch. What delighted and surprised me was that this is an extremely generous book: Along with each menu are lots of variations and additional recipes. There's also a fabulous cooking and assembly timeline, which I just adore, and also a menu and grocery planner which she also offers online. She also gives many sources of additional information. Thank you so much, Ms. Makiko Itoh!
B00785P2QC|5.0|love it. it is fun and kills time in between things I have to do. it has an easy to learn guide also..
0385363125|3.0|It was a slow read for me in the begining, but towards the end it left me wanting to read book 2 asap
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I love that it's lightweight and hardly added any bulk to my kindle. It's stiff on the back and sides for protection and has a nice soft-lined cover that turns into the stand. It only works really well as a stand on a table or other flat surface, not really well as a stand in bed or on the sofa pillows. I don't count that as a negative, because I had a pretty good idea that's how it was going to behave.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|The story continues and it's just as good as the first book.  Couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the final book.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this game has nice looking graphics and is relatively easy to play. I re ommened it to my granddaughters.and others and others
B007THA4FI|5.0|Hard to put down. Believable plus entertaining, start to finish.  These people are as real as your own friends and neighbors.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Iron man is in his suit more in avengers than iron man1 and ironman2 combined. Hulk is the hulk we've never seen before and the best yet. Mark ruffalo nailed him perfectly. Chris evans and hemsworth were both great as well. I'd highly recomend to anybody whos a movie fan.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|After listening to the album for the second time, it'a a good album, but compared to their other album's, this one is at the bottom. It's creative and new work for them, but I love when bands play their work without the assistance of computer aided, but 2nd law has some good songs and some not so good songs. So I give it 3 out 5 stars.
B005ES0YKO|3.0|they look great. the reason for 3 instead of 5 stars is that they are not built like the original croc model. they are not quite as foot conforming and supportive for those with feet who are a bit achy in the plantar area.
B000URWYTS|5.0|I am enjoying this book.  The author's descriptions of all the places that they travel too and the architectural descriptions are great. I think anyone would like reading about such a brilliant man.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought this book was okay and, no, I was not comparing it to Rowling's previous books.  I liked the characters but didn't think the story was interesting.
B002RI9ZPY|2.0|Having read 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' several years ago, I finally got round to finishing the trilogy, and to be honest I could have done so much more with my time. These lengthy books need a seriously good editor as there is just enough subject matter to make one good thriller out of the three, padded out by endless unnecessary explanations of Swedish political history, unexciting sex between unattractive characters, stupendously dull courtroom scenes and incomprehensible ranting about the development of the Swedish business world. Lisbeth Salander is a potentially interesting lead, and a better fiction writer could have developed her persona within this plot to provide a gripping read, instead of a prolonged yawn. I can't help thinking that the spin doctors have gone too far with Stieg Larsson, and had he survived I don't think sales of this trilogy would have warranted even one reprint.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|excellent read hard to  put down. Very different from his more well know books of angels and demons and his other works
B008GVD6D8|5.0|So happy with this book and totally can't wait until the next one!<br /><br />I've recommended it to all my girlfriends :)
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am an avid reader (I read every single night before bed no matter what) and was very excited about the potential of this book. Had been looking for a month for a good one.  My kids grew up on Harry Potter and all the hype about this \\"adult\\" content novel was overwhelming. Now I realize that it was just that, marketing/hype,  and I was sucked in.  I have been trying to read this book for several weeks.  It does not hold my attention and has so many characters that I have to re-read 3-4 pgs. back. each night.  I am now into it for the price of the book w/Amazon so I will continue to struggle through.  A  racket and a disappointment.  Waste of money.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I have read J.K. Rowling and every book that ,JoNesbo  has written.  This  book was so disappointing, Gilliam Flynn seemed to wander around until she could think of someway to go. eross
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is easily my favorite app. So glad it's finally available on my Kindle! So much to see and so little time! I love, love,  love Pinterest!
B00936A0ZW|5.0|I was absolutely blown away by this album upon first listening.  Paul's vocal performances have seriously improved from his early forays into singing.  His guitar playing is thoughtful; he's not just running through the same bag of licks anymore.  Plenty of screaming solos to be had as well.  Emi Gilbert on the keys gets plenty of time in the spotlight as well, who up until now hasn't really been showcased properly, even during live performances.  Finally, the songwriting is superb.  The instrumental numbers are not repetitive, and really are a joy.  The vocal numbers are fantastic as well.  I highly recommend this album to any fan of Paul's solo work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great story from start to finish.  As a full time working mom I tend to only read books that are worth the time. This absolutely is worth it.
1250010489|5.0|Trojan Horse, the sequel to Zero Day, picks up some more action with Jeff and Daryl now together, both professionally and romantically.<br /><br />There is something odd going on with the U.N. A report is expected about the Iranian nuclear program, but it comes out wrong. Who and what changed it? The author of the U.N. report thinks he's losing his mind.<br /><br />Jeff Aiken is called in when something is noticed. It doesn't look good. Someone, likely a nation-state, is trying to meddle in international politics. The U.N. report didn't come out as expected, and the author pleads that somehow it was changed. It must have happened during the time he hit the send button and when it arrived in Whitehall.<br /><br />Cyber espionage has been going on for a while now, and Trojan Horse is not only a reminder of what can happen but also a great read.<br /><br />With a lot more action than Zero Day, Russinovich writes a great sequel again with accurate technical detail. This time Russinovich writes in a way that is more accessible. If you found Zero Day a little hard going and wanted more real life action, along with plenty of explanations of what's going on when it comes to the computer and cyber parts, you will like Trojan Horse.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|You ever use a calculator before? It works just like that, pretty simple... The only thing better than it being a calculator is that it isn't solar powered and has giant buttons. Great for old people.
1250007305|5.0|Do you like techno-thrillers where the author gives a bit of assembler code to illustrate a point, and let's you watch someone at work while they dump the strings in a binary? If you've ever had the slightest bit of experience in analyzing malware you will appreciate that in this book.<br /><br />What makes Zero Day stand out is the author's background and credibility, its focus on cyber terrorism and how realistic it is. It's fiction, but not beyond possibility. There is a lot of reality in Zero Day. When the central character, Jeff Aiken, remarks that a piece of malware \\"seems Russian\\" at first glance, there are actually real reasons for that.<br /><br />We see failures and attacks of all kinds all the time, but for Jeff Aiken, a former government analyst who lost his love in the attack of 9/11, he sees a pattern, and given his background, he pushes the issue. Jeff teams up with a beautiful US-CERT expert Daryl, and as they unravel the mystery the action spills out into the real world towards the end of the book.<br /><br />Even if you don't consider yourself to have much computer expertise, you should not be put off by this book. The explanations are very good and don't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />As well as technical aspects being realistic, the book is well written. The chapters are short and sharp, with memorandums and news stories interspersed throughout the book, which was a nice touch. I read it within one and a half days. It was well paced and highly enjoyable.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|I studied this DVD and wrote a diagnostic conceptualization based on one of the sessions for my doctoral program.  It is an excellent teaching tool.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|This is a pretty good album but I still think that One-X is their best. i would recommend this to any Three Days Grace fan.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|A MUST for everyone that wants to know how life can be when the world gets turned upside-down!  Though unlikely that the dead will ever rise up and walk again, this series gives us an intense look at how life will be post-apocalypse!  B.C., Mayfield Ohio
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great  game!! Can't wait for part Two!!!!!!!!!!!!Very Addictive! ! Next one should be longer. I finished it in a few hours
B0084I9QFU|5.0|This item really did meet my expectations, I love the new songs! Omgosh this should be the record of the year, it's REAL music! And I never have a problem from Amazon, I strongly suggest those who have never bought from here to try it, they will not disappoint. But BAD25 is a wonderful gift for any MJ fan out there, it really captures some of Michael's most personal thoughts. Thumbs up Amazon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has me looking for similar books while waiting for the next one to be released. I thought it picked up perfect from the ending of book one.  Intense car ride and concert scene. I love how they love.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Lots of fun for the whole family rewards good behavior and like the movies the characters are adorable.  Hatching babies teaches patience and vigilance.
B001S86J2Q|5.0|I have loved this movie and John Travolta as long as they have been around.  It makes me happy just to watch it.  I had it on Vcr tape and my vcr player broke so I had to replace it immediately with a dvd.  Takes me back to my teen years!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Excellent movie, lots of action and great story line.The ending was good. A modern movie with an 80/90 s twist.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I really like this album. I think it is much better than 2009's \\"Uprising.\\" Muse ventured out there on this one; lots a new sounds and really more of a dubstep feel to it. When I first heard that there would be dubstep influences on the album, I was a little disappointed. But, after listening to the songs, they are really great. \\"Madness\\" my favorite on the album- very, very unique and clever sounds. I also like Panic Station (sounds a bit like Queen). All in all, there is something for everyone here. Definitely recommend this album to any Muse fans out there.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I love Julia Roberts and she was awesome as the evil queen I liked it mostly cause even my young 4 and 5 yr old grandchildren could enjoy it with me.  I loved it...it was scary enough but not too, and funny. They loved it. We loved it !I esp loved the surprise ending...the dancing...don't want to give it away. So if you love Julia Roberts, as I do, you will love this movie; seven \\"dwarf's\\" and all ;) Great family movie. Something for all members of the family ;) Great show!! Loved all the special effects and all the scenery; it was just awesomely done...beautiful. Can't say enough. Thank you so much. I bought an extra copy to give my grand-daughters for Christmas ;) They will love it!! Its got the \\"princess\\" the \\"prince\\" the \\"dragon\\" just enough scares, some funnies, some serious, but all in all one of the best movies since ET :) ! Loved it. Can't say it enough. ;)You will be dancing too, in the end ;) lol Rated a 10 for Awesome!

0143119680|4.0|I truly cannot believe how much I liked this book. After being a little burned out of the vampire idea, I wasn't sure, but this book is so much more than that. It takes place in Oxford for the first third, the characters are professors of history and medicine, and it's just smart. I love Diana and I love Matthew. The story just got deeper and unfolded with perfect pacing. A little annoyed at how much awareness I have that Diana wears black (everything, all the time, explained too often) but so happy I read this book. I will read the second.
034580404X|5.0|I can't seem to put this book down.  It has all those explicit scenes but you just want to figure out why this man is so mysterious.  He's enticing and you just want to know more about him...
B0016OLC5Q|2.0|I was hoping this was a feel good based on a true story type of movie but boy i was wrong. It was depressing and the movie just dragged out. I love the true story and that he lived out his life on his own terms but i would've loved to see a different turn out on a positive note. The give the real christopher McCandless 5 stars but the movie gets 2.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I was late to the individual franchise and enjoyed all characters in the story. A very family friendly movie and one you may want to watch again--and also Captain America, Thor, and Ironman.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|Superb album start to finish. All The Fools ailed Away should be enough for anyone to get this album, but there is so much more. Great diversity in sound and texture, and Craig Goldy has his first album outing with Dio here. Craig is a great fit for Dio and is more of a natural metal guitarist than Vivian Campbell was. This album is the complete package, great cover art with great music inside and the incredible voice of Ronnie.
B007512LYK|1.0|The Sequel<br />According to the Author's notes in the back of the book, there are over 70 assorted Jane Austen sequels. Sixty nine would have been enough. The best I can say about Death Comes to Pemberly is that I understand PD James' drive to write it, oh OK, and I managed to finish it. Reading a published review before I bought the book, I got the impression that James had at least managed to capture the language and feeling of the times. This is in no way true. She uses a lot of modern PC expressions and idioms, and despite deliberately making an attempt to point it out to us, has failed to appreciate the role of women in 1800s England. Just as one example, a woman who's love child is the central cause of the chain of events leading to murder, simply explains the situation to her prospective husband (not the father) off camera and goes on with her plans to marry him. If he has a say in the matter he chooses not to exercise it and all is right with the world. James' male characters are one dimensional and although they do things which might seem typically male for the period and the genre like cheat on their wives, father illegitimate children, buy their way into society and murder each other, there is no attempt to explain or illustrate their motivations to do them. They just happen. All the discussion of how they are feeling is stuff that Jane Austen wouldn't even have dared attribute to her female characters. Mr Darcey loses sleep , suffers terribly, and longs to be consoled by his wife because, wait for it, George Wickham is to be put on trial.<br /><br />The Book<br />Leaving aside the abysmal attempt to write a Pride and Prejudice sequel, even on it's own merits this book is mediocre at best. As a murder mystery, it just doesn't work. When the murderer confesses, there is no reason why he should confess, his motivation for killing is weak, there are no consequences for his actions, and even the blackest characters in the book come up smelling of roses. Mostof the irritating plot details seem to be explained away as foibles of a bygone culture we cant understand or explain. There is no point, no message, and not even any interesting historical information.<br /><br />The Summary<br />Re-read Austen instead
B008673ZAQ|5.0|XD I love this author and love this book. I can not get enough of Gideon and Eva love story!!!!!! I cant wait for the next book counting down the days till dec 31 XD

However, it is the best stylus I have used and while I haven't been on a dramatic stylus quest like some of the other reviewers, I am generally a pretty picky consumer and was not at all happy with the few i tried before. This guy works really well for highlighting and jotting down quick notes, which is all I need it for.<br /><br />One reviewer said it gets dirty easily - this is true, but I solve that problem by transporting it in the nifty little box it came in. I don't know what kind of light loads some people carry but I don't notice it weighing me down.
B003AKLFAG|5.0|If you are like me and enjoy watching foreign films that's twisted, you must see this Korean classic!<br />This isn't an action movie. More of a thriller/mystery.<br />If you want to get your mind screwed, look no further.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Worth many more than just 5 stars.  This box set is absolutely wonderful and a must-have for any Michael Jackson fan, and even those who arn't.  Shipping is always much too expensive for me being outside of the States, but it was worth every cent I paid.  The new music is fantastic, and even the remixes which I wasn't so keen on to begin with, are growing on me.  The DVD Wembley concert is beyound words - really it is! It is great to have a soundtrack CD of the concert as well, for when one doesn't have time to sit and watch the concert, because believe me you will do nothing else but sit and sit in awe and wonderment.  The booklets are fabulous, as is the poster and sticker.  One can buy the CDs and DVD separately, but I highly recommend that anyone purchase the whole box set and get all these wonderful bells and whistles in this superlative collection.  It will be a treasured item in my growing collection for years, assuming that I don't wear it out first ha ha!!  Congrats to the Michael Jackson estate for putting this package together. Amazon customers, you just have to have it - believe me!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|I haven't cared much for John Hiatt's last three albums: \\"Dirty Jeans...\\" and \\"Open Road\\" were OK, \\"Same Old Man\\" was just short of bad.

098478280X|5.0|This book is a must-have for any interview candidate. Not only does it give practice problems and detailed answers, but it also gives you good advice about how to approach the problems as well as what to expect. I used this book to prepare for my interviews with Microsoft, and Gayle's insight gave me a great idea of how to prepare and how to ace the interview. I recommend this book to anyone who has a coding interview in their future.

B002MCYWHG|5.0|I bought this product in UK, I could not have asked for more, this is a very well designed & safe seat that i found available, my kid enjoys every time we go out on a ride, basically i wanted some seat where my child is safe after all it is a bike, i can keep an eye on him/her and interact continuously, well if he/she falls asleep still no problem Weeride has provided a well designed rest pad for the kiddo if at all they get tired or fall asleep. once it is fitted on the bike it is solid and i like the concept of changing the seat of you have 2 bikes and it is very easy just one thumb bolt to unscrew and done...Overall to say am very happy to buy this product. :)

B004GP3DTK|5.0|Mr Big has always been one of those bands I could take it or leave it. They were fun, and there music was ok. I would not consider myself a Mr Big fan.<br />This has got to be my favorite Mr Big album, it really changes the tone for them, the songs are it are great and lots of fun.<br />The Billy and Paul's playing are fantastic and Eric's voice is sounding great.<br />They are even better live, as I always preferred them live than on the albums, but this one is one that I really dig. can't wait for the next one
B007XNAOS0|5.0|1 Year Later Review:  It's been a year since I purchased this album and wow, how life - and with it what you appreciate - can change. This album, over any other album this year, has been my go-to record; this is the music that, when I find myself browsing my massive music collection, I routinely turn to and connect with. Not sure what else to say about this album than that it has started to help shape how this 30-year-old defines at least his musical tastes. I love this album - it is totally unique; 5 stars!<br /><br />Original review:  Probably one of the most debated albums in the metal lover's world...  Why?  Because Baroness' latest dual album is intentionally NOT metal.  A recent reported anti-metal music creator, John Baizley and crew have crafted a new genre of \\"metal-rock-a-lullabilly\\"...?  (I'm Ron Burgandy?)  I hated this album upon first listen...\\"Seriously?  WTF!!!\\"  However, I believe all music deserves a fair chance, especially when made by one of my favorite bands.<br /><br />I ran into John Baizley a few weeks before the album released...we were both at a Philadelphia brunch spot near fish town.  The dude seemed chill...his whole demeanor.  Hardly the force I had seen live a few weeks earlier.  I divert into meeting Baizley intentionally; Baizley and his art had seemingly (from afar) changed...he'd grown older, and possibly wiser.  After purchasing the album I threw it on my Zune player (anti-apple!) And would listen to it occasionally or whenever one of the songs would pop up randomly.<br /><br />Slowly I noticed the album themes...regret, loss, perspective, honesty, awareness.  This wasn't the \\"Isaak-screaming\\" band I had once loved; Baroness has changed...and I think for the better.  Slowly those trip-hop drumming and dream-like harmonies mixed with fuzz bass and clean melodramatic guitars started to groove together.  Songs at first that seemed a mish-mosh of intentions and sounds slowly began to clarify...slowly they started to become ingenious.  Lyrics began to ring true to myself and then became anthem-like.<br /><br />I give this album four stars.  \\"These days,\\" when a yellow and green song pops up on my anti-establishment yet conformist Mp3 player I turn it up...this type of music is hard to find, and in my experience, totally unique.Lyrics began to ring true to myself and then became anthem-like.<br /><br />I give this album four stars.  \\"These days,\\" when a yellow and green song pops up on my anti-establishment yet conformist Mp3 player I turn it up...this type of music is hard to find, and in my experience, totally unique.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|This album has been highly rated, and it's well deserved. It's a great effort by Dylan.<br />Upon first listening to this Album, I was like \\"Ya, Dylan's back!\\" I would have easily given it 4 stars then.<br />But after a month or so, it's been removed from my car CD changer. And it's become hard for me to listen to as a whole album, there's like 3 or 4 songs that I really enjoy and while I don't dislike the rest, I just find it uninspiring.
B005FISBTO|2.0|As a die-hard Dexter fan, I was somewhat disappointed in Season 5...but MAJORLY disappointed in Season 6.  Having Debra appointed as lieutenant was ridiculous and her inappropriate affections toward Dexter are just plain icky.  Dexter seems to be playing pretty loose with the code these days too. And what about Harrison?  Dexter is too smart to believe that his lifestyle won't rub off on that kid.  Meanwhile Dexter doesn't even try to make Debra watch her mouth around him anymore.  Sorry to say that I'm probably done with Dexter unless Season 7 has some more believable scripts.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great game with pretty good graphics and music that doesn't annoy after hearin for awhile.awesome for game faotd and would probly buy if it wasn't
B008M34INW|4.0|It was a pretty good action movie.  I do not like subtitles on any movie as it is such a distraction to have to read what is said.  Seems like it leaves so much out of the action if you do not speak the language.  Otherwise, I enjoyed it.  Typical Mel Gibson.
B00280LYIC|3.0|I usually never watch the movie before I read the book but in this case I did. I love the story behind the book about the author's son who has dyslexia and ADHD. I wish I would have read the book first. I think it is completely different. I prefer the way the story was told in the movie rather than the book. I still think this book has a great story line so I will continue to read the series.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Loved this book! The story was interesting as were the characters. I read and loved Pillars of the Earth and this was just as good. You don't need to have read Pillars to thoroughly enjoy this as it stands on it's own.

B007L6VR6M|5.0|\\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is the best film I've seen in years.  It was flawless.  Brilliant!  And, really, I've never seen anything like it.<br />\\"Moonrise's...\\" uh, sensibilities... are...<br />whimsically nuts is one way to put it, I guess.  I'm really at a loss for words.<br />But I can't recall when I last had so much fun watching a movie.<br />SPOILER ALERT!  Essentially, this is a story about two twelve year olds (a boy and a girl) who run away from home.  Partly because they're misfits, but mostly because they've \\"fallen in love.\\"<br />Which is exactly the sort of story I'm predisposed to dislike.  In the main, I don't care for movies featuring kids.  Never have (with only rare, rare exceptions).<br />But I think my bias in that regard was a non-issue with \\"Moonrise,\\" because even though it stars kids -- and its plot is centered upon them -- it's not really about  kids.  Having said that, though, I'm not completely sure what \\"Moonrise\\" was about.<br />Director Wes Anderson took an inherently sad, melancholy --potentially tragic -- story about two kids who don't fit and made the audience (me, at least) smile and laugh while watching it.  Given that, then, I think \\"Moonrise\\" is much, much more than a charming little film about two endearing twelve year olds.<br />As I said earlier, however, I'm at a loss for words in trying to describe this film.  It really overwhelmed me.  First chance I get, I intend to watch it another time or two, and then try again to organize my thoughts and feelings about it.  In the meantime, though, I'll say this in closing:  \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is a gem of a film, and I can't begin to imagine anyone who sees it not enjoying it.<br />Oh... almost forgot.  Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton are all positively great in \\"Moonrise.\\"  As were the two young actors.  The casting and acting in \\"Moonrise\\" are as good as it gets.<br />* What follows was written an hour after I wrote the preceding andadded in an \\"edit\\"*<br />Had to take a little more time to really digest this film.<br />Clearly, \\"Moonrise\\" is social commentary.  But social commentary done with wit, insight and intelligence.<br />Wes Anderson's caricatures of people like clueless parents, self-important attorneys, simple-minded, but well-meaning scout masters, and social workers who take themselves too seriously (to mention just some of the \\"Moonrise\\" adults) are spot-on.  And people such as those invite send-ups.  Which I thought Anderson did splendidly.  And with a sense of humor.<br />In any case, I could go on at length about \\"Moonrise.\\"  It worked for me on a number of levels.  Which is why I facetiously entitled this review \\"Wes Anderson For President.\\"  Because, in my experience, it's rare, rare, rare to come across a film this well-done.<br />I should point out, however, that until seeing \\"Moonrise,\\" that I'd never really heard of Wes Anderson.  But after seeing this film, I'm eager to check out what else he's done.
0553801473|5.0|First off, I just want mention that I was both a novice to this series and the fantasy genre as a whole (LOTR has been my main exposure). After watching the first two seasons on HBO, I had to look into reading The Song of Fire and Ice, and it has been one of the most enjoyable series of books I have read. Luckily the timing of reading the books was perfect for me, as I just finished AFFC right after this came out.<br /><br />I read through a lot of reviews before purchasing this and understand people's disappointments. But although the story-lines have significantly slowed down in the last two books, I have found another type of enjoyment in that. What I have liked the best of the series was not the action or battles, but rather the on-going developments in politics. I also have loved how he has continued to expand the world, even if this has brought in seemingly random characters who are not directly related to the main story arch. I have personally appreciated every bit of extra info that has revealed a more and more realistic vision of the world where his characters are living. And most of all, I have LOVED the fact that he has allowed his characters to be killed off. I feel he has placed the developments of the story above any attachment to characters, even if they are \\"good.\\" I found that the hardest events to grapple with events have enriched the realism that is at the heart of the series.<br /><br />Some people may not like this latest book (especially those who have been waiting years for it to come out). Yet I have loved seeing the world develop and revealed more fully (which I think takes perspectives from more characters, especially those who are minor). And the slow movement of the last two books has given me time to take that all in. If you have loved the politics, character development and realism that is at the heart of the series, you will continue to be drawn into the plot in this book. He has spent the time setting everything in place for the restof the series and I cannot wait.

B0091TGWYE|5.0|I bought the Tan Suede version.  Very tight fit when you first get it but after a week or two fits perfectly.  Provides excellent protection against drops or scratches and doesn't add much to the overall size.  The only potential problem is that you have no protection when using the phone so you have to be careful not to drop it when out of the case.  I was worried that the elastic pull strap may mar the finish on the metal trim of my black iphone 5 but that has not been a problem.  It is what it is and does the job beautifully.

However, if you have some business acumen, then save yourself a tenner.<br />From the description and reviews I was expecting some great, in depth case studies. This is not what you get here, the author touches loosely on what people have done in order to put his points across, but never really delves into the nitty gritty interesting parts of start-up success.<br /><br />I read the first three or four chapters, skipped a few pages in the following few chapters and put the book down after chapter 11

0525953728|5.0|I have read a number of first-person books by and about the Navy Seals.  This one is special because it describes the real story of how Osama was eliminated.  These men are absolutely incredible human beings and should get all of the credit for the missions they perform. Mark Owen's story is straightforward - shame on the media for publicizing his real name!  When you read this, you'll feel like you're there with the members of the team and although we all know the end of the story, you'll find it hard to put the book down.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Not sure how I  feel about the ending...kind of disappointed.  I did not expect suspended animation.  I think I   would rather have an ending that was not science fiction

0525953728|5.0|I first must say a large THANK YOU! to all the people who are serving in our armed forces!  The book is wonderful from start to finish.  It is always interesting to see where someone comes from, what drives them and turns them into the person they are when they grow up.  I find it interesting to hear and read about what it takes to become a seal.  The way these pilots/seals handled crazy conditions and kept on striving for the goal they set out to accomplish is OUTSTANDING!  A wonderful tribute to the people who gather information for the United States.  Then in turn to the people who do the right thing and take out the trash in the world today.  A wonderful book about a very special group of people.  THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN!!!!!
B0056CUZRA|5.0|As usual, Ken does not disappoint. Fall of Giants was a page turner from first to last. Was sad to finally finish it. I wanted more....
B008PZ69T8|5.0|I ordered this and have not stopped playing it.  I found in reading the books, I was more familiar with the rock music that was referenced.  I knew some of the classical pieces but not all.  I really have enjoyed the music and getting more familiar with all the works on the album.  I highly recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very pleased with this book I give it two thumbs up or in this case tits up.  Of course it was very sexy as all three of the books were.  But it made me laugh it made me cry.  This book hit all of my senses.  I read all three of them twice.  First to see what all the hype was about and the second to really enjoy the story.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like it!  I enjoy these kind of games.! But, it could be better. I think when it gets time to unlock a room we should earn that. Not have to pay for it!

B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is a nice mini version of the game. I have to say that I built my home in the side of a mountain in the very beginning of the game and hollowed it out quite a bit and after a few days I had mobs of bad guys in my &quot;closed-in&quot; home. This has never happened in the xbox version and makes it kind of pointless to have the home with a door. Is this a bug?  I hope so. For this reason I give it three stars. This a great game none the less and runs very smooth on my kindle. I imagine this will be fixed in a future update. I think it is still worth the money and a great time passer.
0971407614|5.0|I'm a 40 year old guy with a full time job and an eight year old daughter. I work from home from 5am to about 3pm, take care of our daughter and fix dinner from 3 to 6pm and then, after dinner, do dishes, make lunches and try to spend some time with my wife.<br /><br />I don't have a lot of time to myself. And I definitely don't have time (or the money) to drive to the gym, change, work out, shower, change and drive back home.<br /><br />This is the book I've been looking for. I've been following Mark's workout program for about 10 months, and the results have been astonishing. I've lost about 25 lbs, have gained a visible amount of muscle mass and have seen tremendous gains in my fitness. 10 months ago, I couldn't do a single pull-up, could barely do 10 push ups and couldn't hold a plank for a full minute. Today, I can do six pull-ups, do one-arm push-ups and can hold a plank for 3 minutes 30 seconds.<br /><br />I recommend doing a warm up, but even with a warm up, my workouts only take 30-50 minutes, four or five times a week. You don't need to buy anything at all, though after about three months, I decided to buy a pull-up and dip tower, which cost about $100. Much cheaper than the gym.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's the most effective $15 you'll ever spend on your fitness.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|When I bought this recording in 2005, I was mesmerized. \\"The Way Up\\" set me on a musical journey on landscape that would take six consecutive months of listening to traverse. I found this album, at once, aurally and intellectually challenging, infectious, mellifluous, experimental, deliberate, inventive and ultimately satisfying.  This was augmented by seeing the entire work performed live in concert. In a time when most music is more soulless, trite, self-indulgent, unicellular, and unmusical than any other time in the recording industry's history, Pat Metheny Group proved that great music is still being made--one just has to know where to look.<br /><br />One main criticism of The Way Up is that it hits a lull in places.  That is a by-product of conditioning from listening to poorly constructed music for too long.  Poorly made music sits on a single plane with no variances.  Real music has contour and shape, peaks and valleys and a definite beginning, middle and end.  The Way Up is an experience like all great music should be.  To that end, I have an admonition: this album is a departure from anything PMG has done before and it is NOT for the faint of heart.  If you're looking for [[ASIN:B0011ZYNWE Letter from Home]], [[ASIN:B000CZ0Q5W Still Life (Talking)]], [[ASIN:B000WR1IL6 80/81]], [[ASIN:B0000262LA Offramp]], [[ASIN:B000000OU4 We Live Here]], [[ASIN:B0000261NL Pat Metheny Group]], [[ASIN:B001CSQIQY First Circle]], etc. you will be sorely disappointed. I hope instead you will find yourself pleasantly surprised by the many nuances and intricacies on this stellar Tour de Force.  This album proves that PMG is headed in only one direction.  Pat Metheny Group is playing follow the leader and the next move is yours.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love hidden objects games. especially good graphics &amp; storyline. very intriguing &amp; creepy in a good way.ready for more!
B000F8DB4O|5.0|I remember buying this album the day it was released in 1995.  I was teenager and already a hardcore PMG fan.  I loved this album so much I played it over and over. Steve Rodby's bass parts inspired me to take up the instrument.  Before long I was told I could mimic him perfectly.  (Thanks, Steve.) I cannot play the cornet, so I mimicked Mark Ledford's solo from \\"The Girls Next Door\\" on Melodica.  Whenever I hear that track, I still have to break it out and play along to this day.  (Rest in peace, Mark.)<br /><br />I still love this album now 17 years later as if it were released yesterday.  \\"We Live Here\\" was a total departure from anything PMG had done before.  This foray into the Acid Jazz idiom seems like a disaster on paper, but Pat and Lyle showed how it's supposed to be done.  EVERY track is a masterpiece in its own right.  It is something to be experienced for oneself without being muddied by outside analyses so no track by tracks breakdowns here.  My advice:  grab a copy, pour a glass of wine and prepare for multiple eargasms.  Enjoy.
B007QRLEBY|5.0|This show is absolutely awesome. Season one was deleted from Hulu once season two started so I had to buy it on here.  It was great quality.  I had one issue with it buffering but after that I never experienced any problems and Amazon was very helpful and understanding.

B0091THRCU|5.0|This is the best phone carrying case I've yet encountered, and it certainly lives up to its moniker (Snugg). It holds your phone so tightly that it's practically a second skin. You will definitely need to apply some force for entry and use the supplied magnetic pull tab for retrieval. There is no chance of the phone ever falling out, even if you try to shake it out with all your force. The phone gets completely engulfed, leaving the top of the case perfectly flush with the top of the iPhone 5. If you do drop your phone, the end you leave at the top will be vulnerable.<br /><br />There is venting for the sound at the bottom if you put the phone in upright, but you can just as easily flip the phone upside down and have access to the headphone jack while still fully jacketed. That way you'll have full protection and still be able to listen to music (privately) while on the go. The inside smoothness protects the phone and all appears to be well designed and manufactured. And the case looks like it could be the proper front regardless of which side you choose to expose.<br /><br />It just fits how I use my phone. I like it \\"naked\\" when in use (no case, so that the design esthetics can truly shine through) and easily slipped into a carrying case for a much safer transport. And should you receive a phone call while pouched, within a couple of seconds you can easily have it fully exposed again.<br /><br />This is a product that I would very much hope to be around if and when I should purchase a new smart phone in the future with a different physical makeup. It's that great. This product gets the highest marks, with a small footnote that your top will be open to scuffs (not a big deal to me, might be a deal breaker to others).<br /><br />The only question that remains for me is how well it'll hold up over a 2-year contract (or more).<br /><br />Now if I can just find a upright charging dock that is this simple and well designed. ;-)<br /><br />--<br /><br />Note: I don't think the card-carrying aspect of this will be of much use to many others (too tight to fit much of anything), but it does make the overall design more interesting than just a simple, singular rectangle.<br /><br />The only improvement I can currently think of is allowing for some type of fastener for headphones so that one doesn't have to rely on an external device (rubber band).  But I'm unsure if there is enough people who use their phone this way to warrant such a design. But in all fairness, it's probably a much higher volume than the number of people who will use the card-carrying aspect.

B003W77SA8|4.0|ELO has been around for decades and, during the 70's, I only listened to southern rock (Allman Bros, Marshall Tucker, Wet Willie, Lynerd Skynerd and pooh-poohed other genres of music.  As I have aged, my tastes have changed.  I bought three ELO albums on Amazon and have listened to them over and over to the point where I can definitely sing along (much to my wife's dismay) and I can't beleive the complexity of the music.  Cellos, violins.......electric instruments.  Jeff Linde is an amazing writer, producer and musician.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|Prelude to Foundation was written after Second Foundation but covers the period of time when Hari Seldon first comes up with the idea for Psychohistory.

0385534639|3.0|Many years before, two magicians decide that the best way to showcase their skill and compete with each other was through the use of proteges. Through a series of contests, lasting years, their contestants are pitted against against each other in a battle that will result in the death of one of them. Enter Celia and Marco, the newest victims for this round. They are picked by their respective masters from childhood, trained in the arts of illusion and magic all in preparation for a contest that will take over their lives. Neither knows the identity of the other except that they are expected to battle each other to their demise.<br /><br />I got this book months before it's publication and at first I sped through the pages, buoyed by the lush descriptions and wonderful visual pictures that the author was able to create with her words. But after about a hundred pages, I was left wanting, where was the rest of the story? Where was the plot? It all felt like style over substance and nothing more. I struggled through a few more pages and eventually dropped it. I tried again to read it but couldn't get past the lack of a concrete story so I dropped it again. But after a few more months, I once again picked up the book, started from the beginning. This time, I was able to get through it and finish it. It turned out not to be a bad book.<br /><br />I have seen comparisons made of this book to the Harry Potter series and all I will say is that this is as similar to Harry Potter as Harry Potter is to Lord of the Rings. Meaning, not that similar at all. Whereas in Harry Potter the magic draws you in, entrenching you further in the story, in The Night Circus you never really understand the magic and so  it leaves you always a spectator. This is not to say that it was not well described, it was, but it was done so in a way that tries too hard to make it complicated and so leaves the reader without a full understanding of what they are reading.<br /><br />As for the forbidden love motif...well, that was severely lacking. I never felt the star crossed lovers angle worked. I wanted to  feel it through their interactions, the little gestures that solidify love. Rather, I was told how they were so in love, how they cared so much for each other. In other words, the love angle was forced fed to me rather than me seeing any real evidence for it. This meant that I was never invested in Celia and Marco's love so that when it seemed in jeopardy, I didn't really care how it panned out one way or another.<br /><br />And the central magical battle, the thing that starts off this whole book never really pans out to much. It fell short and never really reached the lofty heights it promised. If you pay attention while reading, you will pretty much figure out what the battle is from very early on and it is not exactly earth shattering.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very talented writer. She weaves a beautiful tapestry of words, times and places. Her descriptions are rich, evocative and lyrical. But as great as she was at creating a wonderful mental pictures, it cannot supplant the need for characters who the reader can truly become invested in, really care about. The lack of solid, full bodied and multi faceted characterizations reduces this book's appeal.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am a fairly new Rush fan of a couple of years and I have nothing but praise for the concept Album Clockwork Angels.  It hearkens back to their famous themed album 2112 and some would say Hemispheres as well.  A steampunk influenced story that bears listening to over and over.  Others have described the songs in great detail but I will say it is hard to passively listen to this album, it makes you want to move, play the air drums and flat out rock!<br /><br />Should be album of the year hands down and they deserve to be in the Hall of Fame after this or there is no justice.<br /><br />\\"I can't stop thinking big\\"  that sums up this album, big bold and beautiful.
1583334386|5.0|Willpower is an interesting and trick aspect of humanity. Too little or too much can be devastating. And, as many neuroscience books point out, we are not very good at really knowing what we are doing nor why we are doing it. Makes the balancing act of things like Willpower difficult in a changing world that we need to experiment consistently to really thrive.<br /><br />Many books around these experiments and topics offer little in the way of tools to improve. This book is exceptional in that aspect. I wrote a number of things down on my ever expanding list of things to keep in mind:<br /><br />Pay attention to feelings, but don't believe every thought. Thoughts float away like leaves in a stream or seem to get blown away like clouds of cold breath by simply breathing normally. Thoughts bubble up and only give power to the ones that make sense to pursue and let the others drift away like subconscious brain farts.<br /><br />Slow breathing to 4 breaths per minute to prep or reset for two minutes or more (experiment with duration)<br />Take a break, take a walk or whatever when you are feeling stress or amped up (not new but very much worth keeping in mind)<br /><br />Near critical habits for most all of us<br />sleep more than six hours<br />exercise<br />Shelve/move off of worrying/grinding about non-solvable, may never have happened - out of my control thinking patterns<br />Watch desire or want for things as the brain is wired for addiction in the unsatisfied.<br /><br />Hmmm. Changing my review from four to five star as that is a lot of help and there is so much more in the book. I did not see much on the danger of willpower from the standpoint of over doing the discipline thing and it is just as fraught with danger and peril. Another book perhaps.

This movie's 3d quality is lightyears ahead of the other two.  My favorite 3d effect is the man in front of the mirror. The story and acting is pretty good but if you are looking for a 3d movie, this is it.  Haven't seen the Avatar 3D yet.
B00009R86L|5.0|This is really a great shoulder pad; I bought it as my new Dooney and Bourke purse was SO heavy and the strap so narrow that I couldn't stand it on my shoulder. I loved the purse and refused to give it up so luckily I found this product. That said, the cushioning is awesome but I wish it was a bit narrower and that the pad was also black. It looks really odd hanging down when I'm not using the shoulder pad, and my purse is red so it stands out like a sore thumb. The top is slippery and so the purse strap moves around a bit too much, but all in all I am thrilled with it.<br /><br />I just wish I had a choice in width and could get the pad in black. I might use a permanent marker on it so there's not two colors competing with the red. For luggage or anything you lug, this strap is awesome. I can see that the glue isn't the best but so far it's not been a problem. Buy it, you'll like it.
B0029XIWCY|4.0|Contains a lot of great stuff.  I thought the  song Strange Fruit would be on the compilation which brought it down a star.
0062127241|2.0|Here's what I don't get: How can PT wax so poetic in thousands of interviews over the years and then write a memoir that's so sketchy and poorly-written?  MAJOR disappointment....
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Spent many hours on this game. Husband and I both downloaded to our devises and played trying to beat. each other to a new level. Really injoyed the game.
0060763280|4.0|This book is great to read multiple times.  I read it over a few months ago now and have forgotten most of the things in the book.  But is a book you should re-read every year to get yourself on target with your financial goals.  It did help me with a few strategies for opening a savings account and actually starting to save money for the first time.
0061537969|5.0|Anyone who has a dog will swear they can understand everything that we say so it's easy to put yourself in the dogs place.  I know what my dog wants like now when he has come to the computer and told me to get off and play with him.  I got him from a rescue shelter and he was a foxhound that wouldn't hunt.  I think he may have been abused because he never and I mean never barks.  I would encourage all dog lovers to read The Art of Racing in the Rain and have some tissues ready but you will also laugh and understand why your dog has done some of the things this dog did.  I loved it.
B0000AK7AA|5.0|This was a great buy! My kids love it. The dvd did not say that it had shipped but I received it very shortly after I purchased it. Less than a week wait time :)!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Like most apps it takes a little practice to make is fast and reliable.  I works fine and I know it will be useful in the future.  Thank you.
B008G12ERC|5.0|I am addicted to this album. Much more so than I was Resistance which I did love btw. It is hard for me to pick a favorite song off this album. Is it the charged up Panic Station? The epic building Survival? Or maybe the easy to sing along with Explorers? The classic Muse sounding Animals? I don't know because there are no weak songs on this album. Unsustainable sets out to end the album in a similar fashion that Exogenesis Symphony did Resistance. Where it is maybe not as good as Symphony it is still very good.<br /><br />The album does not sound like anything Muse put out before on a whole but you can say that with every Muse album. I think it ranks up there with Absolution and Black Holes. Definately a must get. I have the whole album stuck in my head.
B0072OFM28|5.0|This is a great movie!  I wouldn't want teenagers to watch it as it is quite bloody and gorie and it is quite x-rated.  I liked the first season best.  Loved the way it ended.  I'm more than satisfied with receiving my purchase so quickly from Amazon.
1465001107|5.0|B E A U T I F U L  Photos !  And it's all about BAD Era !<br /> I loved it !  And there is space around the numbers , to<br /> write notes , if you want it.
B006O7XOOW|5.0|Our 15 month old twins love this.  They dance to the music and love it when the floor raises up and the balls get pushed out and fall down the legs.  They probably love the balls more than anything else.  They take these balls and walk all over the house with them and roll them around on the floor.  Overall very happy and a great product.
B0017I3U74|5.0|THis movie is the perfect mix of a great story, excellent acting, and well directed.<br />This is a movie to watch again and again.
0446580848|5.0|This was a excellent, well written story. There were too many great elements to the story for me to list them all, but let me just offer a couple of them.<br /><br />DeMille's descriptions of places and people are very complete, without being boring. I really enjoyed the detailed verbal painting of the local settings, he managed to bring in all of the senses in a very effective way.<br /><br />There are constant plot twists, right up until the end. They are all perfectly setup - they surprise the reader in a very satisfying way. No cheap writer tricks here at all.<br /><br />I also enjoyed hearing from Paul Brenner again. I hope he's resurrecting the protagonist from \\"General's Daughter\\" and \\"Up Country\\" in this volume because he plans on resurrecting the series. I was also happy to find out Paul and Cynthia are still a thing.<br /><br />This is a very good book. Anyone who's enjoyed DeMille in the past needs to read it. Anyone that enjoys well written thrillers needs to read it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book is extraordinary.  Keeps you at the edge of your seat from page one till the last word of the book.  Absolutely loved it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The Mark of Athena was a very exciting and well written book. The suspense full ending just made me want the next one immediately.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have played many versions of solitaire on various platforms. This one is as good as I've played. Easy to navigate. Easy to undo if you've got 'lazy fingers' and draw cards by accident.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very well written book. Good suspense and sweet romance. I could read it again. It is worth the purchase and your time.
B004XWMXW4|4.0|I bought this CD for my 7 year old nephew who is interested in Cello. I thought it would be kind of quirky but wanted him to hear what could be done on cello besides the normal classical stuff. After listening to it I wish I would have bought two copies. The songs they are playing are in line with my tastes in music and instead of the quirky little interpretations I expected these guys really rocked out on those cellos. This was an awesome CD and I can't wait to hear more from the 2 Cellos.
B00095NX9G|5.0|The Serpentine DVD is one of the best that money can buy. The content is amazing. You would have to go to many classes to get this much training.  I would not recommend this for beginners because the lessons move quickly, and some of the basics are not given a lot of explanation.  It is assumed that the viewer has mastered the fundemtals (it's not stated. But, it's the impression I got).  This is a \\"work your butt off\\" DVD. You will need to pause it and practice a lot of what's on here.  Five stars to this one for the amazing amount of content, two choreos, two performances and the mini lectures are just some of what's on it.  And, I must say, Rachel Brice looks sooooooo beautiful in this that it makes me want to work and sweat to get through all the material with a big smile on my face.
0515141429|1.0|The nonsensical plot was driven by outlandish coincidence.  Awful 1-dimensional characters.  A truly terrible book.  The ending was ridiculous.  So many plot holes and contrived situations.  Ugg.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Enojoyed book 1, was not at all thrilled with the very abrupt ending. To avid readers you may as well purchase the second and the time of your initial purchase because book one leaves you in cyberspace, overall very well writter.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|you know those games that are so boring but so addictive? ya well this game is one of those so ya get it but be aware its boring but additive
