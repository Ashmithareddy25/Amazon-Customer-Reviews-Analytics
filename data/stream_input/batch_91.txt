B0067TMVEQ|5|Great fit. I will definitely buy another one in another color. I recommend this product to anyone seeking a nice shrug.
B00HQRT93E|5|I dont have it yet but I love everything I have ordered from PattyBoutik.  THE BEST!!
B007CMEUJQ|5|Great case. My fiancé loves it. Good quality .
B0061LYV6Q|5|Beautiful, better than expected. I bought it when it was much more expensive, but I don't regret it because I have worn it many times. The fabric is of a good quality, and the size is the right one.
B00K3GL244|5|Extremely adorable!
B00IAZ119Q|2|Very cute item but ran too small. I fit between an 2x and 3x with my weight in my hips and buttocks. I thought I would have no problem if I ordered this in a 3x. I could get it on but it was a pretty tight fit and it did not stretch to flatter or even go over my hips.<br />I returned and got a speedy response from the company who I purchased from. They even returned the shipping costs of $3.80.
B0046BIZCO|1|WAY TOO BIG. I ordered a small/med and it fit my husband better than me. Also, didn't receive belt for robe.
B00I1D6JJE|5|great socks and sm/med fie my 8 and 10 yr old perfectly.
B003UYMWD6|5|great scarf.
B00HCOMJHY|5|Love these socks
B00AQW6W7W|5|This scarf is absoulutely gorgeous! I love it and i plan on ordering more, i just dont like that you cant pick your own color, they just send you whatever, but its awesome and worth the wait...
B000NOWQ82|5|I love these glasses. They are a real bargain for 60$! It turns heads in the street and my friends keep asking me where I got them from. It actually looks a lot nicer than you see in the picture on the website. It comes in a sturdy, white Diesel case with a cleaning cloth. I simply love it!
B00505DW8W|4|This DEFINITELY runs small. I am about 5'4&#34; and 128 pounds. I typically wear a medium women's shirt, so I ordered an XL. While the XL is still fitted, there is room for an extra layer underneath. As some other reviewers pointed out, the cape is not tied on: it is Velcro'd to the shoulders. However, for under $20, and for a spirit day at work (I'm a teacher), I'd say overall this is a good buy. I'll probably take off the Velcro  after wearing the shirt for work and use it as a pajama top.
B005GNO0CU|4|I found this bra a good fit giving a good shape. It does what is is suppose to, minimize the bust without giving you a squashed look. Comfortable to wear and reasonably priced. I purchased 2 in different colors and would purchase again.
B005W0LPYS|5|This bra is the most comfortable bra ever. It fits well, it feels comfortable and the colors are lovely. I have two but probably will purchase at least two more in different colors. Love it.
B005CSOFKQ|5|Warm! Comfy!
B003ZFEU8A|4|It bends out of shape REALLY easily. I would just be careful about how you store it, or you'll be buying new bones. Still, works as advertised.
B00ODDU41K|5|love this hat!!!!!
B00ESGFNJK|5|Pretty
B00U6WXBLM|3|It is really difficult to guess what size a item will be from china. I bought the green one in XL. I normally wear med.  This fits more like a small.
B005SZFM78|3|Liked overall design but they sent wrong color ordered tan sent blue. Material looks and feels long lasting. Has taper so even thou little big she will grow into it.
B000EOBNVC|5|Outstanding fit, comfort and price. I have purchased this product twice and will buy again in the near future.
B007KDXEHQ|5|It says 1 size fits all but when I got the socks the label said for sizes 10-13 which worked out for me since I am size 12 but thought that might help others looking at these socks.  These socks are very well made and fit great.  Another review I saw said they only got 1 pair, I on the other hand received 3 pairs as advertised.  I was able to get them when they were on sale for $12 which was a great price for what you get.
B00B2HV4LE|5|The pants are a good，But I bought a big.I own the wrong choice.If you buy a trumpet,The pants are very comfortable
B001D1WQV6|1|DEFINITELY does not look like the picture. But it'll do.
B00AYX9SCO|5|I really love the colors of this corset. It is beautiful and comfortable. I wish that I hadn't followed everybody's suggestion to order up a size, but it will work. I would love to order other colors.
B0007GERPQ|4|This bathing suit was incredibly cute and flattering for me.  I wore it the day it arrived and all the next weekend.  For me, being in a bathing suit for that long is quite an accomplishment, and I actually felt cute while wearing it.  I got a lot of compliments on it, and I would recomend this to anyone who was looking for a stylish, flattering tankini.
B007U8D5GQ|1|I am not that small of a person but ordered the small. It was still too big and would not stay on my shoulders. Adjusting it was rediculous.
B0033UVIS2|2|I bought these in the color \\"Dawn\\" which was a regular denim color.<br /><br />They run small and are sooo itchy! They fit weird too. They wannt to ride up my stomach and come way down off my butt. Weird! It's disappointing because they look nice as far as the color.<br /><br />I did notice little threads sticking out in random places too. I just envision them unraveling at some point.<br /><br />If they fit you and do not itch like crazy, they are worth the few dollars they cost, I suppose. I paid about 6 bucks for them - so I got what I paid for.
B00E3P1YZ8|1|Ok I'm a big dude so I ordered a XXXXl shirt when I get the shirt in I felt like tommy boy a fat guy in a little coat until I handed the shirt to my 12 year old daughter of average build and it just fit her in size and length<br /><br />If you are a big dude move on not the shirt for you
B004XH5YZM|5|This was a gift for my dad for christmas, he loved it.  He said it was perfect for the weather he encounters!
B00IUOU4DQ|5|good good good from a chinese girl  好好好！！！
B00LLO3KQA|3|They're okay, the heel tends to fall off in the shoe despite the back grip in the sock.
B004IZVTSU|5|I actually hate wearing a bras.  I decided to try these sport bras.  They are very comfortable and even look nice under tee shirts.  If you are tired of being uncomfortable in you bras, give these a try.  The price is good too,
B00MCHQBW0|5|I like them so far
B00MHDY70M|1|fit smaller than the size.
B00QH0LV5K|4|Bought these for  the cargo pockets.  Weird. They have the pocket back cloth but no way to use them.  They are sewn shut??? Nice fit otherwise
B000MXB37Y|5|Excellent in every way on Bali part. I ordered a size too large so a tad looser than it should be. Other than that, I'm totally pleased.
B00GLQ6HWW|5|I bought these for my daughter and she loves them and is able to wear them with everything. I would recommend to everyone.
B000FRVLY2|1|The idea of the \\"gown's\\" are nice, especially for frequent newborn diaper changes. This brand just didn't work for us. The arm's are ridiculously long. My baby is average size and the sleeve's were an extra 3\\" or more past her hands, rolling them wouldn't even help. I have other gown's that work great. I suppose if your looking to put a much older baby in these (since the size is 0-6 mo) or if your baby has unusually long arms, these would be great, otherwise forget it.
B0019MYS56|2|When i saw this product I was excited to get all my daughters headbands out of her drawer. But most of hers have bows on them so they are heavy on one side and fall off. I was disappointed since the photo showed headbands with bows on them!!!
B00O2PS150|4|Shirt arrived packaged well. Nice material. I thought the face wiuld be a tad bit bigger but after reviewing sale pic again,,face is size it should be.
B00M404KGO|5|Outfit is well made.
B005JA8OJK|4|gold toe are nice quality and it does make it easier to match when they have the little lines on the toes!  :)
B007A37HTW|5|Perfect fit, I had to order more in different colors. Now I don't have to wear my bra. I exercise in this daily!
B0059E4H92|5|Fits like a Glove!
B007IRM1LY|5|Perfect ... long shirt is what all shirts should be ... regular ones that bunch up are absurd ... this fits great!
B00GKEI2XC|5|XL are super long in the legs, which I love &#60;3<br />Comfy AF
B00MRG7HY2|5|Love my Greek fishermans hat
B003ZEN000|5|I don't have tiny nipples- they're average size and these fit perfect over them. In the pkg was a lace pair of Xs, a plain black satin pair of Xs and several very small black hearts that look cute just applied here or there- right between the hipbone and pubic bone os a good spot for the little hearts.
B0051U18NW|5|Great socks
B00LOL28LS|3|Small size maybe a kids hat
B000NBYI86|2|Comfy and soft but you can really see through the white shorts! Can't wear them anywhere but the house and I was hoping to wear them in the color run this year.
B000IBNCNI|5|cold feet at night , this was a perfect solution to problem, not tight around legs so good for overnight wearing
B0125Y4SF6|5|Super comfortable sleepwear ! Soft and sexy, lace trimmed. Beautiful color. Well made. Sizes run a bit small. I wear a 3/4 and the medium fits perfect. I was offered this item in exchange for an unbiased review.
B00MNPPS6G|5|perfect to wear with western boots
B001NSCHDQ|5|The pants are amazing. When you have to wear pants everyday that need to meet a rigorous work style these are the pants to buy. Very comfortable, affordable, & stylish. Will definitely buy these again
B00OBM7V28|5|These fit,as expected n i love them
B005OCDOVQ|2|Its ok. But better to just get a red track suit
B00S7BBBXE|3|I like it.  Well worth it for the price.
B001GAP9LS|5|nice.  Spectacular appearance.
B00HAYHTYO|5|Other than this taking awhile to get to me, I have absolutely no issues with this product! It's cute and perfect for a Spring or Summer day! It doesn't wrap around that much but you easily see the elephants on it! It is very thin and soft fabric. Especially for the price it is well worth it!
B00J1X5KDE|5|Its kinda big but not by much. My son is 7 months and wearing a 12 month size.  I love this outfit. Its really adorable. Definitely a good by.
B00772AF2W|5|FREE FROM GLOCK, AMONG OTHER ITEMS ( PEN, PATCH, CATALOG, ETC) AS PART OF THEIR &#34;PROMO PACK&#34;. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS CALL AND ASK FOR THE &#34;PROMO PACK&#34;. GLOCK ROCKS!
B001C5KVP6|5|my little brother loved the rosary necklace! dont know what exactly to say to use enough characters here. it's a great purchase lol
B005904NMW|5|love my golf belt. It comes with 2 additional ball markers. Nice letter and stylish.
B001PUFOU0|5|Bowties are cool!
B00ARBI8SS|4|The price is fair and good short to have for summer wear
B00469PPX8|4|I bought this to wear under low-cut v-necks so I don't need the added warmth of a tank top.  It looks very nice and does the job, but the cups are a little big.  It will work, though, so I'll keep it.
B000GKY25I|4|Worked well. Won first place at a costume party and this was part of my costume as sherlock holmes from the great mouse detective.
B0045HDG46|5|I've bought this brand bra before and will do so again.  Usually I buy the nude, this time I bought the &#34;white&#34; one. I love the color on this one - it's like vanilla bean ice cream.<br /><br />I like how these bras fit; they're comfortable; the underwire doesn't poke; the side jiggly stuff can be pulled down easily into the bra; the straps don't cut in; the support of the girls is great (38C). There's virtually no headlight action (very very little will show if it's really cold -- but then if it's that cold I should be wearing something warmer). I get a lot of wear out of these bras and I've never had an underwire break or poke out, the straps don't fall down (of course, you have to adjust them properly in the first place), and actually no problems with the brand at all.  Hope all this helps.
B00CMD9S10|5|These tight (in a good way) bright orange pants tucked into my black cowboy boots to perfectly round out my outfit for game 4 of the World Series. 11-4 Giants
B005BZLIUK|5|This t-shirt has my favorite quarterback's name and number as well as my favorite team's logo.  Ken Stabler was from a better era in NFL history - the 1970s and 1980s.  My favorite era in the NFL was the 1970s - really the last time when players were still real men and not more and more pansy-like as they are today.  This was back when there weren't all the rules that exist today that are designed to protect the players and things that also slow the games down.  Really, this is what is happening to all sports, not just football.  Baseball, hockey, etc., are all wimpier than they used to be.  Everything is an instant replay, challenge, etc. nowadays.  New wimpier rules as well.  Call me old school, but I like watching old NFL films from the '60s and '70s, back when the Super Bowl was played during the daytime and there wasn't some elaborate overdone halftime show.  I like watching old NHL games, back when there was no advertising on the walls of the ice rink and no on-ice advertising and many players didn't wear helmets.<br /><br />Ken Stabler should be in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame.  It's a shame he hasn't gotten in and won't experience it if he does get in.
B0073YQFOQ|4|Although not wear, but feel very good thing, is a color or a little error. With pleasure.The right and will buy.
B0007D2AK8|5|very goog
B00SZ79NEO|1|The material and pattern is not what is advertised.
B00QN5DEMM|4|This is nice! Only problem with it is the bra part could have been more supportive or lifting. But it does look just like the picture, so I can't complain much. This will look alot nicer if you have big boobs though!
B00JRHMGPE|5|So comfortable. Feels like you aren't wearing anything
B00UC04EC8|5|Love it
B00FENP61Q|5|Very nice!
B008AK6EL6|5|This outfit is very nice and I would recommend it for anyone to purchase for there child or as a gift to someone else. I didnt wait long at all.  I ordered it and it came like the very next day and nicely packed. The quality is vantastic!
B00XKM2JZO|5|My dad loved this shirt. The best part, he wears it in front of my brothers. When anyone asks who his favorite child is he tells them he is not going to say her name..... Hahaha, I am the only daughter.
B001EUJSF8|3|I really liked the dress... I seemed of good quality. However, I was disappointed with the headpiece. The size didn't quite fit, and it didn't look at all like the one in the picture. My 6 year old daughter tried it on, and it fit her perfectly. I almost doubted if there hadn't been a mix up and I got the adult sized dress with the kid sized headpiece...
B0079J2Z80|5|I am always afraid to shop for clothing online. If the garment disappoints the hassle of returning it is a true horror story.  Not so with my skirt!  It fits and I am a very satisfied customer.
B00BZHZ30Y|4|I love this a little tight but I love it
B005IPKEOE|4|Moderate quality but nicely designed.
B00BCPSZOA|5|I saw a friend's pictures with their little boy wearing this and had to have it! Great for the rival family at football games - not team specific, just 'GO FOOTBALL'.
B001CZF32M|5|These are terrific pants, roomy and comfortable and breathable and attractive.<br /><br />Also,Cottonique is very diligent about protecting buyers from possible triggers, like elastic, latex and so on.<br /><br />If you're super-sensitive to smells, as I am, don't worry if you have to wash them a few times to get rid of a mild chemical smell. I don't know if it's fire retardant, or a remnant from the plastic packaging, but after 4-5 washings they're fine.<br /><br />They're comfortable, well made (I haven't had them long, but they look like they'll last forever), and consciously and carefully created for people whose needs are largely ignored by the marketplace.<br /><br />Thank you for carrying these and other Cottonique products!
B00LTNBG0A|1|wwaaayyy ttooo small. Way too small... all over. returned
B007TOMSAK|5|Beautiful patch!  Just what I expected.
B00M8OI7Y2|4|Fit as expected. Very much worth the price. Only complaint is the Inseam is a little short
B00A8N24NA|3|I think it fits very weird, I'm very slim and it was super tight on the chest area, looks kinda strange on the bank and way much longer than the picture looks.
B00D4L7RNK|2|Too small
B009WRRV9K|5|This is a great hat for the money!!  My son loves it. Looks great but more importantly keeps his head/ears warm!
B00JDRDHLU|5|they loved it
B009ZAHNBK|5|Great for A to B bust sizes.  I love the way it looks and feel.  Hides the love handles well also.
B005EVQ3D8|4|Compfy!
B002Q0X0FO|5|chose this rate because it filled my expectations of a good quality product, comfortable in addition to having a youthful design, is highly recommended for people they like wear a hat
B00NFDEQS6|3|Can't believe this item was shipped without my complete address! It had the city/state and my phone number so the local post office called to get the shipping info. The outfit is not the best quality but it fits the price. It's cute enough-- the whole outfit is one piece-- bow tie and vest are attached.
B0051CBDOE|4|I love how it feels. My boyfriend loves it too. The only thing I don't like it's if I tie it, it doesn't start closed.
B00A2UOMDE|5|These are for a nine year old Whovian. He loves them and after repeated washings, they are holding up just fine.
B00AYXF5HQ|1|Did not get the jean leggings that I ordered.  A pair of really ugly jean type legging was sent instead.
B002KMJEUI|5|Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and not only does he look GREAT in it, but the sweater is very soft, well-made and sharp looking!  Would definitely recommend and/or buy a similar product.
B00KNEKMII|4|These jeans fit well even though they were bought on the basis of size 28 that I have in another color. Let's see how they hold up.
B001UFENYI|2|Too big and too loose. Do not stay up.
B00APUNYTY|4|I'm a taller girl, almost 6 feet. The height works even for me-the band hits me in the right area of the thigh. My only issue is a minor one, and one other reviewers have said so it was no surprise at the delicacy of the stocking part.  That is the  reason for the 4 star rating, otherwise it would be a 5. No problem putting on the stocking, it when on with no snagging etc.  The lace part has enough stretch, but still has structure so it keeps it shape. I have yet to wear it for a long period of time, but it has done well so far. I'd definitely recommend it, the price is great, and the overall construction of the garment  is good.
B00631VLV2|4|Arms are a little short and it runs a tad big around, but other than that it's very nice.
B009OVZ2Z4|5|My 10 years old daughter love this. I have ordered orange one, and it is bright and very beautiful. Washed a couple of times (on delicate) already - still as new.
B00FF1DNFI|4|My grandson was thrilled when he pulled the shirt out of the bag.  It looks great and the size is just as I thought!
B001L990R8|1|Looks great but very very cheap material; got a small hole after the first wash! Really?! Very disappointed.
B00MFG1E8O|5|The gown is beautiful and great material does not wrinkle. Perfect for a shower gift. Sexy but classy
B00KXHNT0I|5|Quality product.
B00XBIOQ2Q|4|It's very nice just a little long and wide on me I'm 5ft. I'm small I know lol! Wish they have Extra Small it would be Perfect but it's ok I can always get it tailor.  The Material is very nice..if you guys toller than me, this gonna fit you guys perfect. It's worth it for the Price😊
B00DYNOPRE|5|Serves my purposes.  Not too big, not too small.  Fits perfectly around me being a big guy and all :)
B00K6BAHDI|5|Very comfortable and debating whether to buy several in same color. When I like a hoodie, I need multiples. I love how the hood is large so it covers to the front of head and has opening on the sides. I was worried it would run big so I bought the medium, but a small would have worked better. Still loving the fit and quality.
B002GJ5IU0|5|My son loves this costume. He didn't want to take it off when I let him try it on to see if it fit. I couldn't quit laughing at him cause he thought he was so cool with all the muscles.
B0085ITI1G|5|This is the cutest hat and kept my grandson warm all winter.
B00EFT1FKG|1|This product is thin!  The collar is almost like a woman's?  There is no little yrellow tag at the base of the shirt!  The only reason I purchased it! I do not recomend this cheap product, should have been 4 dollars. That would have been to high!
B002KNIKIE|5|It's what I needed
B00RE3DKSA|4|These are nice jeans with a flare—not too tight, but you might want to order a size up so they aren't incredibly tight. My biggest issue, however, was the length. WOW. I know I'm short (5 foot), but the jeans were at least 6 inches too long for my tallest heels. They will be a good length if you're tall, but average or shorter girls will have to get them hemmed. It's worth it though, for how soft they are.
B00GOY4HIC|4|A little too long being I'm 5'1 but overall it's nice
B0083FXP6A|1|These pants are supposed to be machine washable.  I took them out of the dryer after washing them the first time, and the legs are wrinkled up like I have never seen!  They are so wrinkled that I can't even iron them.  Complete waste of money.  Normally, I have been very happy with Perry Ellis pants, but these are terrible.  These are not the same quality you get from Macy's.  I don't know why they are the same price.
B00K1KZ5T0|4|Fits great.
B00EFGIACK|5|Love this dress! It arrived timely. Beautiful rich red color. Sewn well. Fit my 24 month old great. Perfect holiday dress!
B009MNS77O|5|It was bought for a present after the person had watched Billy Connelly on Route 66.  It made a great gift
B00ELS291A|5|This hat is an excellent value. I have two. When they wear out I will buy more. They are perfect for summer weather. The fit is good. This seller was very prompt.
B00GMFP3B8|5|Fit well with the knowledge from other reviews that it runs small. Quality fabric which was surprising given the price.
B00FVICKGI|5|Beautiful
B000P0CRY2|5|We got one of these, and soon figured out that we each needed to have our own.  This one runs smaller than expected. If you normally are on the line between a Man's S & a Child's L this will fit, but snugly. The other one seemed true to size. It may have been just this one hat? or perhaps a difference between the sizes.    Here is the review I wrote for the other one -     I love this hat. The wide brim keeps both my glasses & back of my neck dry - and at the same time. Because it is made of PreCip, I can shake it off when I get inside and it is dry enough to stick in my pocket. It rolls up nicely so I can keep it in my jacket pocket or bag and never be without it - especially nice in the rainy PacNW. Great for commuting but at home in the wild as well.    There is a drawstring around the base so you can custom fit the size to your head. The sides have magnets so you can fold them up and they stay. The chin strap is removable which is also nice. I'm less impressed with the company name across the front, but then I don't like logo'd merchandise in general.
B00GPHTI5K|5|Great quality and a perfect fit.<br />Must mention about the brand misspell since it has nothing to do with Calvin Klein. It's a Tahari suit period
B0073BX5V0|5|as described- came early. we are happy. price at nordstroms was twice as much. would purchase again from this site.  pink is very bright but not vivid and not pastel.
B00IMCXT7Y|4|Very short....can't really wear without full coverage leggings being I'm 5'9&#34;
B0041OLI66|5|Rock band and the other side
B00BJEV49C|4|Purchased this dress in brown colour, it looks good though the orange belt on it looks odd. I have decided to replace it with a beige belt with perfectly matches
B007KF1U98|5|These socks are good and stretchy, fit my size 2 son perfectly.  They are also very soft.  Because I just got them I cannot say how they will wash up or wear, but so far so good.
B0089NM9RC|5|They are great socks!
B00PE8Q49Y|1|too, too small for woman XL.
B00JTDKKYA|3|I ordered a large, and it is a fun sweatshirt, but not big enough to layer clothes underneath it...
B00DZUVDPS|5|excelent product
B00EI8GGIU|2|Runs very small, definitely not correctly sized.  Gave it to my daughter who is smaller than I am
B005WW0RSG|5|Double duty umbrella and fantasy toy.
B00CEH22BC|5|Great item for the price.
B0057RJ3OA|5|Ha funny this should come up! I'm wearing it right now!
B00GTSE2G0|4|I like this  a lot and plan to order more for this summer. Fits well, feels and looks good too
B00GYX5048|5|Contours to body
B00NQIOGBC|5|Love this little gown looks adorable
B001TEHRC0|5|Great quality for the price.  I should have gotten 1 size smaller, but with the nice adjustment in the back it still work good.
B00NB6NDAE|5|My son loves it
B00DJMDHC4|3|Nice jacket the zipper sticks hard to zip up and down
B0051I7OKA|5|for 12 mo old boy.  Most reviews said was gonna be too small, so we ordered th larger.  it was huge... sent back fo th smaller... it wasnt th best fit either.. but for one night it was addorable.  Thankful the shipping got it here in time.
B0094MP2PS|5|This shirt is the best some reviews made it seemed like it was bad but in my opinion its great. The material is great and it fits great as well. Im satisfied
B00HRUKOEI|5|Beautiful when matched to the Natori Feathers bra - nice little sexy combo!  The fit is true to size.
B00BLW2Q8U|3|Regular
B002BEDRE4|3|I wore this skiing and it was great, not itchy and it stayed on well.
B00GOL1NUK|3|It's ok.  It's listed as a jumper & it is not what I would consider a jumper; it's a sweater.  It's not even long.  It falls a little below the waist.  It is see through so I wore a cami underneath it.  There were alot of strings that had to be cut off before I wore it.  Like I said, it's ok, but it's not really what I was expecting.
B006UCX7IE|5|I've bought a lot of merino socks...many different brands and prices...but these are the best.  They are the most comfortable, and most durable.  Well done Carhartt!
B001FOR2DS|5|If you don't want to wear your nice belts when you're working in dirty conditions, traveling, or just need a plain old belt for casual wear this is the ticket. I love that I can adjust the tightness enough so my shorts don't get too loose or slide down when I'm eating. So comfortable. After a week I cut the length to my comfort so I don't have a too long tongue hanging loose. Am getting tired of belts worn out because the leather wrinkles, cracks or the holes get too big. Another type of belt I like is Kenneth Cole Reaction which has a pin with a small ball at the buckle. Just pop the pin into the belt hole of your choice. No need to bend the leather constantly after stringing it into the buckle. Love that this belt is reversible so I have a black and a brown in one. Those old fashionable woven leather belts just don't hold up and the holes rip apart easily. Will buy a black canvas belt next.
B00JJ696GA|5|Reviews can make me nervous sometimes so I was not sure what to expect.  So I give it 5 stars because it was better than what I was planning for.  I am 6'2 : 220 and bought an x-large.  Fits great on me.  And the color is black no doubt about it.  The pictures had me concerned that it might be different.  The feel of the jacket is also great.
B0018OUI54|4|I already own a pair of these so I knew they fit.  I wouldn't order if you haven't tried them on before.
B00AZHN5OG|5|Had bought the Champion shorts before this and they had a cheap drawstring that broke.  These are quality build with a quality drawstring - great for lounging around the house or working out.
B008BHKAQI|5|I love this coat. I live in Utah and I haven't found a day yet we're I wasn't Snug and comfortable and this luxurious coat. Lots of pockets and very comfortable to wear.  I don't really get into fashion but have had several compliments on its looks. I could care less, I'm warm and comfortable.
B008JUOM0C|5|very nice, as advertised
B00QTEGUAK|3|I haven't worn it yet. I thought the colors would be a little deeper.
B00MTVNJ9M|4|Comfortable, medium-weight socks.  Cabela's brand (I don't have any of their stores near me) and pretty good value.  No regrets on the purchase.
B00IWYGAMI|5|Love this shirt.  The Mountain Tee Shirts are my favorites.
B00BRB23I8|5|Fits as expected. Not too tight.
B00896EUKI|5|I purchased this as a gift for a friend going through chemo for leukemia.  She loved it and said it fit perfectly.
B004KJF1V0|4|I love this bra but I have to give it only 4 stars because the clasp in the middle breaks.  I have 4 bras like this with the clasp broken.
B00IXTBBI0|5|Great doing business!
B00EAORF50|5|I bought this dress for my ten year old daughter for her band concert. It had to be long since she has to sit with her legs somewhat apart holding a French horn. It fits great! Perfect length for her just about medium, 54&#34; frame. Flats or heels will do. Lays beautifully.
B00JUFUNVW|1|Belt is far larger than appears in the picture. Very disappointing! Holes in the belt are similarly oversized. Pictures should be redone.
B00P1NL1JU|5|Adorable!
B00JYKQRHM|5|My son, an anchorman fan, loved the t-shirt, but said it fit a bit to big.
B00JY2U8O8|5|I received my package about 2 weeks before the estimated date! Tried it on and love it!! I'm 5 foot and 128 pounds with big lower body, fits amazing.
B00Z5V7PQ6|5|Great fit, good quality! I am on the short side so I will be getting it tailored. Other than that going one size up as other reviews suggested was a good idea. 5' 1'' 136lbs and I ordered an XL. Very happy with the product, will order other colors.
B00IWWFVX4|5|Fit and shipped right when it said it would!
B00613OPK6|2|I did a search on silk and this came up but when I received the product it feels pretty bad and feels scratchy on my wife so wouldnt recommend it. Now, having said that, it looks great and its not on for long anyway...but if it were a softer material it would have been great.
B00UTG8U2U|4|A bit snug but it's great!
B004TMQAFE|5|Bought this shirt because this is one of the few that I don't have. Fits perfectly, sized as the way I ordered it, many compliments from other Juggalo family members that I know. Most say &#34;that's not on the site&#34; and I tell them no...it's member's only. lol...gotta love amazon and the internet :) Will be ordering more in the future. thanks!
B0088PB75Q|5|This is a very high quality hat.  Most boonie hats are really light and cheap feeling.<br />This one is serious headgear.  I get the feeling that I'll own it for a long time and it won't wear out.<br />The fabric might be too heavy if you live in the hotter parts of the country.<br />The only thing I don't like is it's made in Vietnam.  That's a little creepy - poetic justice, maybe?
B004TERI5S|5|Bought fo my wife, she wears it nightly for reading in bed, and it is already possibly her favorite garment. Score !!
B00UI4PY9A|4|I like roomy sleepear, so I ordered a size larger than I normally would, and it's good that I did! It's roomy enough everywhere except across the upper chest, where it is just barely comfortable. It's pretty though, and far nicer than the threadbare gowns I've been wearing.
B0030CIDJK|4|I love the smoothness and it protects my phone very well. it's easy to put on/take off. Not a big fan of the design but i like it. It's a really good deal, i'd recommend buying it. Shipping was fast to, it got delivered earlier than expected.
B00A4BSJ44|5|Garment is well made, fits well and the fabric is a thin 100% cotton that will be cool for the hot days of summer. My grand daughter looks cute and comfortable in it as the elastic on the legs is not tight or too loose. I would not hesitate to purchase this in as many colors as possible.
B00KB5K6P8|5|Great socks!  Perfect fit!
B00AMKITJ2|3|Very stiff
B00OFUAUMY|1|Way too small. Unsatisfied
B002FBGYRU|5|Fit just as I'd hoped, they feel great. Not heavy & the keep your toes warm & dry. Yes they are pricier than cheaper made products you find in the big-box store, but these work very well. I'll buy more!
B000ZQAFIQ|5|this is perfect for my son i like it
B00VQ49R2G|5|Made beautifully runs a little big but is still very nice!
B00FL0XRLS|5|better than expected
B008CV5252|5|This dress is very nice quality and fits true to size.  It has a flattering fit, but not too tailored.  The company-EVER PRETTY is a very wonderful company to work with-- great customer service!!
B007OQ9FIQ|2|Nice look/style, but all reviewers said these ran short, so I bought the regulars, instead of the petite. they were 6 inches too long, baggy through the seat and legs. I returned them.
B00E1JLOYM|1|the quality is poor and the color is not stable
B004GKALE0|5|excelente
B00LN4O2PG|5|Shorts very comfortable.
B000PKR93Q|4|Great hat
B0070NWAU8|5|Great stuff
B003PPSNPG|5|Great Looking Beanie and decently warm while still being breathable.
B00C6P39ZU|5|Love the visor!  It has a large brim for greater sun protection.  Comfortable fit.  Beautiful, vibrant red in color and you've gotta love the big bow on the back!  Bought one for myself and one for my sister.  It was agreat hit with all our girlfriends!
B0081M6KOE|5|No issues
B0040CAMN4|5|My 11 year old daughter just tried on her new dress that we ordered for her to wear to a wedding, dress is beautiful, per sizing info height and weight she should have fit into a size 12, I got her a 10 because she has never fit into any size 12 dress, my decision was correct, the size 10 fits perfect, consider this if your daughter is thin especially in the chest, my daughter is tall for her age, and the dress length is fine.  Dress embroidery looks to be of good quality, all in all happy about dress and price.
B001D0EHX2|3|As my title suggests, this item fits to the size, but it fits too snugly to make it look good. I am curvy and apparently too curvy for this with 36 bust (which smooshes them in an unsightly way but does technically fit) 31 waist (which was fine) and 41 hips which meant it barely covered my backend and if I moved an inch...it rode up.
B0089QBK6K|1|Sucked
B00GXYM5LE|5|so happy to find thomas in larger size never see this in 7. now if only to find pajamas
B0073HGRPA|5|My little one started school and to help make rainy days more fun and not think about &#34;eww, I'm getting all wet&#34;, my little girl LOVES this not-scary-looking dino umbrella.  To think how little kids think and feel, it sure puts priceless smiles on their faces and yours!  I'm sure glad I got this...two, actually!
B007CU9AB6|5|this is what i was looking for it fit great it<br /><br />it was just what i was looking for the right colour  it fit great thank&#34;s again
B00BB0YIEM|5|Love the jeans best jeans I have every brought in my life!I would buy another pair in a heartbeat.<br />Going to tell all my friend.
B00CBQ9APW|2|shrinks way to small after drying, dry clean only
B006UMHYNS|5|The size is just a tap bit too small or may be  a tap bit too big , but it was perfect
B00DYZ9EK0|5|nice
B005QIQY9C|3|Too small
B00AGI8BOS|4|I got this vest in a bigger size to wear over a bulky hooded sweatshirt.  I have not worn it yet, but it seems fine.
B00DW7I0SC|5|Love this top... after reading sizing reviews, order one size up.  Bearing this in mind, it fit as I expected.
B00H3IO742|3|XL was not quite XL. Unfortunately since it was a birthday present I could not exchange it (lack of time) I just hope that the gentleman it was intended for can squeeze into it.
B00N4WXR1A|5|I got a small and it fit perfectly it wasn't too tight either I'm a size 2 and usually have to do an xs with shirts but not with this one its totally cute and I loved it so did my husband!
B00IYQ9RTM|4|It's kind of thin, but great for the price.
B00N5PPLCO|5|Great!
B00Q55O8BG|5|Identical to the packer sidelines hat when G was ironed on! Love it!
B00N72SC62|4|Fits just right and is comfortable..really like it
B008MOHGVM|2|Either I am color blind or cant read but this item came to me in YELLOW.  Cant really wear a yellow sand scarf out here in the field.  I will be spotted a mile away.  Thanks!
B000ERDVD2|4|everybody enjoyed it.  good value<br />it was a hit at our friends Christmas party last year and we will use it again
B00CBQ5U1K|4|The item really fix very well and compare to others asian clothes the material and the design is not bad.
B005DBAB78|5|I absolutely love it! If you are a domo fan you will love it too. It's just as the picture, but the only problem I have is that it can rip off easily.
B00CXXO4GS|5|No extra room
B004IFVG6U|5|Except that the supplier couldn't get the shipping down, the product is excellent
B00FEZLAFA|5|I followed the advice of other reviewers and ordered a XXL (I have a 46&#34; Chest) and it fits great after a washing. I would have been dissappointed had I ordered my typical size (XL). This is officially branded HBO merchandise. The Black is a dark solid black and the printing is a subdued white/gray. My wife is jealous of it, so I'm going need to look for a design for her as well.
B00V6P8E3I|3|look like the picture ,though it may not fit exactly right for me.
B00KAVWLL0|5|The dress is absolutely gorgeous. Angel Bride sent me emails to get the exact fit and answered all of my questions. Excellent service and excellent quality
B001EJMT4G|5|Look big
B000QWDQVC|5|I use it daily, all day, it makes me look awesome, I bought it as a post natal compression and it help me reduce my belly very fast, I use it when I exercise too, and helps keep my back straight when carrying my babies
B00DEZS24E|5|Bought these for my son for Christmas and was very pleased to find an assorted size of stays and the magnets are top notch. They should fit any shirt he needs and should stay in place well--much better than the cheap plastic collar stays.  Great service.
B001OCPX2I|3|i should get a size medium the next time i order this, will order again for color white and red
B00DND4PAM|5|I HAD ONE MANY YEARS AGO IT WAS VERY WORNED OUT, SO I BOUGHT A MENS FLANNEL IT WAS THICKER AND WARMER. IT WAS VERY COLD AT THAT TIME.I RECOMMEND IT.
B0073PZOME|4|This dress looks very pretty when worn. And yes, it is very form-fitting. The slits are very flattering. Looks great with wedges and even flats.
B0059ECBBS|5|Beautiful Belt, arrive when Amazon said it would.  Thank You,
B00J7EYDWQ|4|The fabric is very thin and doesn't have any support.  I've had 3 children so supportive under garments are a definite must.<br />The next size down might have been too small, I think it will be a comfortable fit.<br />Definitely worth the money
B008ZAHEXI|1|This is really not a women's sized shirt to begin with, and certainly not a women's large by long shot.  I bought it for my 12 year old daughter who is pretty slim and it barely fit to her begin with.  Once it went through the wash, it became the equivalent of a child's size 8.  I have never owned anything that shrank that much in my life.  If you have an eight year old daughter who loves Batman, this is the shirt for you, but there is no way this shirt could ever fit an adult.
B008SAVBNO|5|I bought this jersey for my husband. The fit is true to size and they jersey material is nice and very washable. The jersey wasn't to long in length and the lettering was well put on the jersey. Great jersey.
B0041OIAAI|3|First, these jeans look much darker in person than they do in the image shown. I was looking for a lighter shade jean and these weren't as light as I thought they would be.<br /><br />Like others have said in reviews, when wearing it felt like the jeans were going to fall off when I was wearing them. I am about six months pregnant and inbewteen regular jeans and maternity jeans it feels like. They didn't fit so well at the top, and was kind of bunching in areas in the front and butt area so it wasn't really appealing. The length is very long, and the fit everywhere else was nice.<br /><br />Because of the fit at the top of the jean and the color I ended up returning the jeans.
B00JDPZQSO|5|This shirt is amazing. It us very unique. Have yet to see another one being worn. The shirt is a standout even when not glowing in the dark
B00D3H0FB6|5|great product
B00ACIHFTE|4|My husband likes them and asked me to order more.
B001U2Y5NA|4|It is a tad short. Granted, all dancers with long torsos are going to have trouble with leotards. Otherwise I like it. Very comfortable, the straps across the back are really lovely and the top stays on even through bending all over the place.
B00KDOR2MC|5|These pants are perfect! They are comfortable and they have a very tailored fit.
B005PZCBEI|5|It was the perfect accessory to my daughter's Halloween costume--from the Dr. Who television series.  &#34;Are you my Mummy?&#34;  She loved it!
B00BADY3F4|5|More stunning in person than on the image.  recieved multiple positive comments on my initial night of wearing them.  Originally I purchased for a unique shirt, but I have worn them with many other shirts.  The cufflinks always garners attention, Great color scheme in this jewelry peice.  A great add to any cufflink collection.
B00C9XY6MO|3|No idea how to exchange
B00F0WW844|5|Fits well and stays put.
B00BZESE5S|5|Its really  give u a smooth look
B00LVSB0ZO|4|I bought this for my grandson and it is so cute on him. It does run a little small. The price was great.
B00E0EPP4I|3|Beautiful dress but a bit on small side .  Zipper sticks too but no time to send back no info on returns in pkg
B007MY67H2|5|These are perfect for DD's in a low impact workout like barre!  Very comfy and no pokey wires sticking you during your workout.
B00GN4ZVJM|3|I'm 5'3&#34;, the black skirt touches the floor, but doesn't seem to be an issue while walking.  Overall it's a good buy
B00M3CZR7E|5|great selection of mens socks
B00HNSRUNW|1|Runs extremely small. Beware
B00MOMGR7C|2|The elastic is really weak.  Would like them if they stayed up.
B0038LUVCA|5|I have worn Jockey white and black for many years. The gray heather is the softest of the 3.
B00IF9MIIK|4|Im 5'2. 120 lbs. I have a butt. I ordered a large bc of some of the reviews. They were too big for me.<br />They worked though, I just had to roll them up and they were fine!<br /><br />Reviews are right though, there is nooooo stretch in these things, which is why I was conservative and bought the bigger size.
B004WLE49G|5|Very nice, sturdy key chain! Bright colors and even nicer than I expected. Too soon to know how well it holds up, but I really like the look and smooth feel of it. Great gift for a fan of the series.
B001T9O3KE|3|Great denim quality, but one was and my son would not wear them. The waist started perfect and then he could not button them. Darn.
B00029I100|5|The American Flag shirt I purchased fit just right,and I received a lot of great comments on how people loved the shirt. I was able to ware the shirt on Memorial Day to represent my Honor for all our soldiers who have died for our Freedom.
B0013SZM6K|1|The picture looks great, but the fit is awful.  The neck/halter strap has snaps (I've never seen before) that are impossible and would probably scratch a lot.  I had to return it which was another pain.  I ended up paying $10.00 for an item I gave back.  Go figure.
B00IRW7I76|2|Runs very small, had to return it
B0009GE2R2|3|I'm not sure whether it shrunk more than normal or whether it was too small before being washed.
B00KBXNSSC|4|Good item, likes picture
B00HESUB4Q|4|Good Fit..
B00IXWSTQ4|4|love it, I would like more colors!!!
B00OK19B64|3|I like the dress but its way too small. I wear a 14 on dresses and ordered the XXL and doesn't fit.
B0051WGUEM|4|My kids grow out of their jackets every year.  I hate spending a lot of money for a new jacket that they will only wear a few times.  These just came for Christmas.  This is a nice medium weight jacket.  My boys get hot and they don't like really heavy jackets.  This jacket runs small in my opinion.  I have 12 year olds that are about 100 pounds and 5 feet tall.  I ordered the size 14/16 and had to return it and get the 18/20 because the arms were too short and the jacket just seemed tight.  I am happy with the 18/20.  I bought two jackets in the different colors.  I got the charcoal and the black.  I like the charcoal the best.  It's just a little brighter and kind of cool.
B00DYVI9QY|5|I usually by Haggar  pants because they look good, are comfortable, and the price is very attractive considering the quality.
B00DF12C5C|1|the waist is to big and the length is to short i order 36/29 the tag say that but it is not
B00CONNDGO|5|I'm in love with my waist trainer! First off, it arrived just 3 days after I ordered it, which was great because it wasn't scheduled to come that soon. It also fits great. I'm 5'1 & I weigh 147lbs. I ordered a medium-34 & it's perfect. Typically I wear small or medium in tops. For those who are concerned about the tightness, it's supposed to be tight. It's understandable if you've never worn a corset before, but you'll get used to it. Happy Training!
B00T63S9NW|1|I hate this dress!  Its too frail too small and see through!
B00CIA2EUE|4|My brother loved it. The material is too thin. Needs to be thicker.
B00CKBY7O2|4|I like the flexfit  hat, It really fits well. I have other flexfit hats and I have had them for a while know, they still look good and fit well.<br />If in the future I need to purchase another hat it will be of the same kind.
B00J120ORM|1|It's not what I expected, definitely not worth $100.
B002WI8TZQ|5|I'm looking snappy with my new pocket squares! Great price and quality for the look and feel you get. Colors really pop. Email them your colors and they do confirm which is great customer service.  I'd highly recommend.
B003D0ZH1G|2|This item is really pretty.  It came just like it looks in the picture.  However the sizing is off.  1 size fits all is not accurate.  I am a petite size 6/8.  The straps are way too long even after adjusted.  I've washed it 1 time and there are already stings hanging everywhere.  Lastly, the velcro continuously sticks to the satin - which is already ruined - less than 3 weeks after getting it for Chrsitmas.  Not an inexpensive wrap for it to have so many negatives.
B00P4NGK02|5|I get tons of compliments on this hat.  Plus, it keeps me warm by covering my hair and ears.  In the winter I'll often put my hair up after a shower and this will keep my head warm while my hair is still wet.<br /><br />Some of the hats like this I've bought in the past are too small to put over my head when my hair is in a high pony or bun, but this one fits perfectly.
B0015QX1FO|5|I was warned that it rubs small so I bought it 2 sizes bigger. Love, love it!!!! Wish there were other colors.
B00EK1MBWU|5|I love this Roxy swim gear. It fits perfectly and am looking for other colours in this size. Great buy!
B00KG22GU4|4|Love it the necklace is a bit weird so I didn't wear it but the shirt works without the necklace.
B00G5KRS0Y|5|i LOVE THE SHIRT.  My favorite color is yellow, so I love it!
B00CXADIT0|3|Belt seems a little too stiff and is a bit undersized.  Didn't realize it was made in Mexico.....Merry Christmas 2013
B0030LV848|5|this is really nice quality, i got it very quickly, I got this for my husband and he loved it, a must try!
B008NCYB16|5|5'8&#34; and a little &#34;hippy&#34; fit perfectly, down to ankle and up to waist.  Perfect!
B00JHAUVZ8|4|The style is not right for me --but very cute!
B005BHY4Z4|2|But I could not get even up to my thighs! And no, I took the size by measurements<br />Had to take it back
B005F9ER1E|5|These worked great as a stocking stuffer.  Super cute and longer than I thought.  Go up to the knee!  Great to wear inside boots etc.  Very cute Socks and nice quality too!  Thank you!
B006U9RKGW|5|I wear these pants at least once a week to work. It stretches with your movement. Since it is form fitting, you will need no-show panties. I've washed more than 10 times so far and the color and the texture held up well. Perfect pants for semi casual work environment I'd say.
B00GASFA5G|3|Dress was well made and beautiful.  Unfortunately the sizing was off for me.
B00BIEYX6E|5|Great graphics. Flattering neckline. Nice fit around the torso, not too tight. I was worried with the XS that it might be so tight that it would ride up, but there's some nice drape there. I'm 5'5&#34;, 108 lbs, 32B. The sleeves, however, are very tight under the armpit. I have skinny arms, but slightly broad shoulders, so that could be it. I think I will cut the sleeves into cap sleeves and see how that goes.
B0070QC08W|5|Very nice hat, good material, love the color on this one, I have 3 or 4 of these hats in different colors. Very nice fit, I also like the fact that its just blank on the front.
B00MFJLMP6|5|Love this! Fast shipping. Product as described. Thank you
B00UFCUH10|2|This looks nothing like the picture and is made of cheap material.  I was worried I would rip it putting it on.  I bought a size larger than I usually wear and instead of looking lacey and flowey like the picture it's tight and mostly cheap mesh material.  I was surprised it didn't come apart when I tried it on.  If you're buying it with the intended purpose being for it to end up in a ball on the floor it's see through and revealing enough, but be careful because it will tear easily if your partner is too eager.  I will definitely buy lingerie in store from now on, since the pictures all seem very misleading online.
B00PCCJ6WO|3|If I had seen this in person or in photos, I might have looked for something else. It looks like someone got a special material with cardstock on one side & woven material on the other & printed a design with an inkjet printer. This is stated in the description (&#34;Fabric bonded cardstock design encased in a 12 gauge plastic....&#34;), but images would help in making clear the quality level of this item. I was looking for something of a bit higher quality.
B00NVAK024|5|Just as described.
B00GHQZRB8|5|Fun socks for a themed party
B00OXF1EYE|5|Love this flannel! Fits perfectly, and I love the studs on the pocket. Pretty good quality and the color is amazing!
B006L87UDU|4|Nice hat, seems to be made nice
B0032GBPDA|2|Positive:  Price was inexpensive. Seller shipped item very quickly.  Item received matched the description online.    Negative:  Item was glued to cardboard backing with some type of putty or caulking compound that was set into the fabric of the suspenders.  Now it is stained, and the finish on the suspender fabric comes off as I try to scrape away the putty compound.  I know it was cheap, but when I buy a new item I expect it to be blemish-free.
B001F5O8FM|4|These goggles are comfortable and stay on my head when I ride bike.  Only 4 stars because they really fog up quite easily, and if there is an easy solution for that problem I haven't found it yet.  If they didn't fog up they'd easily be 5 stars!
B0024YG3H4|1|too thin you could almost see thru it!  way too thin!  Didn't wear it and didn't take time to send it back
B002R8EPWC|5|This shirt is high quality and is actually the size that states on the product description- which sometimes isn't the case :) . Overall impressed.
B00IRVYJTW|5|the material felt strangely cold at first but my mom said its because its nicer. im in love with this shirt. it fits in the sleeves and is loose int he body, its about tunic length on me (im 5ft tall). i want to own this shirt in more colors because its the best
B00UKNS7SE|2|I honestly hate this product. It looses shape after the third wear and it's really obvious when you are wearing it under your clothes. I do not recommend it
B00BHUV7N6|4|I bought this for a friend who's a huge LoL fan and he loves it. There are some details about the hat that was off. The goggle bands should be brown not red and they could have made the ears a little thicker.<br /><br />Can't really complain because it was pretty cheap and friend still loved it.
B008GVFXRU|4|has that pleather smell for the first few days but it goes away. it seems well made and worth the price.
B00FM6ENQ4|5|Sweet!
B007EKQ7SI|4|I like these. They're plenty warm, which was my primary concern. I will second some of the other comments and say that they feel a tad small, but bang for the buck, I haven't found anything I like better. A solid buy.
B008135ST6|5|nese don diqka cool ja vlen ta blesh ket South pool<br />kjo eshte mark qe krijon produket origjinale<br />i love  this Long Sleeve
B00H4MYKTY|5|I love it mannn ! i wear Size M - US . but i order the XL size because I think it a little small . And it fit my size ! it looks swaggg mannn (y) i will order more , thank you .
B0009NERJ8|5|These are probably the best socks I have ever owned. I wish they weren't quite so much because I'd love to get some more.
B00J02EVXQ|2|Well I figured being American maybe some bigger guys were trying to wear this as I'm super skinny thought it might work. XL is the same as a US Ladies Small. Felt like Chris Farley trying to get this thing off. Buy for a Tween at most. Nice colors but lots of freyed strings. Would probably fit a 5'6&#34; girl that weighs 110lbs.
B002X09ZZG|4|Thinner than expected...<br />But it looks good.
B00IT39XBW|1|It's not what I thought.  I figured I'd like it.  But it don't fit the way I'd like it to.
B0062U11RI|4|The coat fit as expected. Good quality. Would recommend to others.
B00UYMM0V6|5|My dress is pretty
B00FUXINCY|4|By the way it does have three snaps on the bill. I was looking for one with no snaps like my old cap
B000UVLEEK|1|The product was in the original package, and unopened.  However, the glue had hardened and the &#34;butt cheeks&#34; had fallen off.  It looks like it has been sitting on the shelf many many years for it to be this bad.  I will have to either buy something else or 'fix it'.<br />Not at all what I was hoping for.  Very disappointed. A waste of money.
B00BPIPMG8|3|the tee's material is really thin, not the best quality cotton but otherwise the fit is good, like the shirt!
B00BNBB5OA|4|I would gve these bras 5 stars if the material didn't pill so badly. Other than that they're perfect - hard to find a bra that has padding wihtout underwires. These have enough padding so no one can tell if I'm cold...
B00Q3BZH12|1|Found out after the fact that these &#34;wool&#34; socks are 100% ACRYLIC
B004C7MAUU|5|Quality T-shirt and printing. Estimated 80 washings so far with no fading. Note: always wash inside out. As a woodsman, I like wearing clothes that represent what I love: our woods
B00A7TEV54|4|These pants fit nicely with sturdy seams and a chunky waist tie.  I love the bounty of pockets!  My only complaint is that the pant legs are prone to static cling and pick up lots of lint (at least in the black color).  Hopefully a few more washes and wears will get rid of the issue.  Otherwise, I highly recommend them!
B00U5NYOZO|3|I take a medium but order large just in case.  Found the large to be too tight.
B00K1HP552|4|I'm usually a med/large but after the reviews I read ordered the Xl and it fit perfect with room for growing bump.
B00OMD72IE|4|I got a large and its actuly a little bigger than I expected but it still looks good and covers my fat ;)
B00QAE70B2|3|Get a size larger than what you are. I'm a 34b and 130 lbs and a medium fit fine. The one I got was not a push-up and the bottoms felt weird. I'd suggest washing it before using it. It looks like the first picture. I was kinda thrown off and hesitant to get this but I got it within a day and the color is awesome.
B00AJWZE6E|3|Disappointed that the zipper broke on one of the two we bought after just a couple months. We were planning to use these for three years running, as we did with our last set of Columbia fleeces. Every other Columbia product I've bought has been very durable. Otherwise, the jacket is great.
B003YDV6Z8|5|I got these for my hubby as he has those men wallets that need these inserts and unfortunately they do break easily, but they are cheap enough to buy and replace.
B000P9GAQY|5|My favorite Wire-Free bra! I got four of Calvin Klein Women's Wire-Free Contour T-Shirt Bras with different colors and  I will order more.
B00B9FJIIK|4|Some what  not high to the waist.  Too much bikini like  .
B0007CKN6M|3|No complains when it comes to service or pruduct, but the cut is not complementing and my wife doesn't like it. Guess I'll have to lose some weight
B00R1M4CMM|5|The delivery was on time, the quality is much better than expected. The hood emblem is awesome. The hood fits a bit large, but no big deal. The assassin's symbol on the right sleeve is perfect. 100 % pleased with this purchase.
B00C57A70O|5|Great !!
B008Y9ZWQ6|4|I love this shirt, but it does run large.  I recommend ordering one size smaller than you normally wear.  Otherwise, it's well made and soft.  Beautiful colors, too.
B00KWEE9DI|5|Love it!
B00E0NWD80|1|To small and did not fit right
B0067FKCQ4|3|the pocket for your I.D. is so tight, I put my I.D. in it and I don't think I'll ever get it out. It's taking a long time to loose the cheep leather smell.
B00E6239UG|5|Good fit. Has held up through several washes and machine drying with no fading or shrinking (always washed on cold).
B008P7ZRMG|1|Not quality my money trash
B0037KMI6E|4|This fits well and has not yet gotten runners like the Walmart brand. So far so good for our little dancer.
B0106QF494|5|Super Sexy!
B011AXQAS6|4|im 5'0 147 pounds. this dress does run smaller so I would say order one up. im normallyy a Med but order a LG 12 due to the other reviews and im happy I did. because it fit perfect. came fast also
B007VIYVOA|5|Works well for me.  Most jeans for my hip size are too long in the leg.  I don't have to wear a belt.  this is good if you have a curvy rear and shorter legs.
B00B4QP0L8|4|I am short waisted so the fit just below the waist is perfect. No gap. I only wish they came in petite short. Tight fit at fist, but slight strech out and they are perfect.
B0018VFH3A|1|The quality was poor.  Very stiff and uncomfortable even after washing.  Cheap feeling.  Pants and shirt so big that I can't wear the shirt
B00AF920TU|5|I love these bras so much I wish the company made regular underwire-free bras in addition to nursing bras- I would definitely buy them! Comfortable, supportive, cute, and fun patterns- all around a great bra!
B00QM4UQU2|4|Very nice dress. comfortable material. a bit large around the arms and shoulders as I am small in that area
B000Q7I6O4|3|The hat does not maintain its shape and the small children are unable to wear it. We did get the shipment quickly but it did not quite seem like what was advertised.
B007WFZVGE|5|Excellente
B006X25U7C|4|After reading other readers reviews I decided to order a size up. I am a size 2 and would normally order a small, but I ordered a medium instead. I am glad I did because the medium fits just about perfect. It is still snug and form fitting but comfortable at the same time. Very cute.
B000V5ANX8|4|If you are looking for the Canterbury &#34;over the calf&#34; socks, this Extended Sock is much, much bigger.  On the other hand if you are a really tall person with a 13-15 foot, this is just for you.
B009LZ3KDE|5|Love this sweater. Material could be a little thicker, as it's not really made for windy days, but overall a good product.
B0028OFCZ4|5|Nice lounge pants fits well, good fabric, washed well, didn't fade,<br />Have only worn once but really like the way they feel
B00PKF0136|5|I had viewed this dress for months before ordering it. I'm a single mom of three and my money is spent on them. My daughter encouraged me to go ahead with the purchase and I'm so happy I did. I wore it on mother's day and received many compliments. It's beautiful and feels amazing. My favorite dress!
B003L74ZV4|4|For the price, you will not find a more confortable belt, I purchased about three months and wear to work everyday, it shows no sign of wear.<br />Would have given it five stars but it has a little too much stretch, you really have to tighthen to hold up those pants in place.<br />But overall, I really like this belt.
B00GI2HM64|5|Very happy and will be back
B002GJT5AE|5|I love these sweatshirts, the one I recently purchased was a gift for my boyfriend, and he loves to wear it as we transition into spring. It's warm enough to wear on a 30-40 degree day! They are also built well.
B00IMSBQVO|5|My 2 year old wears a size 6 shoe and these fit her just right with room to grow.  She loves to wear them..
B00156T7ZC|4|These are very nice and seem to last longer than most.  They seem to hold up without getting snags and runs longer than most in this price range and you can find this very pair in a few extra colors beyond the traditional selections of red, black, or white.  However, one pack I got someone at the factory was sloughing because I had to throw one out: it was quite obvious an irregular got through as the size was all screwed up and there were 2 runs and a crooked seam.  It was a real mess.  I did not feel like returning them and worrying about shipping and doing all that work first.  So while they are awesome, be organized and check them when you get them so it is easy for you to flip them back for an exchange if it is necessary.  It was probably a fluke.  They look great and I believe you will love them like I do.
B006TC6IL8|5|Some Carhartt shirts are thin or lower quality depending on where they are manufactured.  This shirt is high quality and fits well.  I'd buy it again.
B001GIPD1G|5|I have bought Trumpette socks for my 2 grand children since 2006.  My daughter assures me these are the only socks that fit & stay on. I love them.  I loved when they finally made them big enough to fit 12-18 mos. sizes.  Kathy from CT, grandsons in CA
B00IOF6FDO|1|The size XL fit my 11 year old! It's sizing is more like a 12-14 kids... Very disappointed, because I really liked the bathing suit
B00QVEYXF2|5|Very good quality
B00HQQTR2S|4|this coat fit pretty good, just a bit too much room for me. Warm and plain.
B00LEVSATC|5|my son reall y love it
B00CBR3RQY|5|Fits well when you don't have bulky clothes underneath.
B00LGERI68|5|My daughter loves this purple, shimmery outfit.
B00E97KLT0|5|Happy wife, happy life.
B00V83TOG4|4|A shirt that represents The Walking Dead. Nice shirt, great design. Thanks!
B00ANA04IU|4|Somewhat bigger than other shirts.  Good quality
B0018OFL4M|5|my husband is happy with his jeans. it was a good price and a good fit. liked the color. thanks
B001LJQFZS|4|I had received my order in a very timely manner and I'm not disappointed in the product at all, it's what I had expected, as it was a replacement of an older one.
B00EE30NV0|2|This item was not what we expected , way too small !!
B00AC6SYYQ|3|To buy this, you obviously have to like the Transformers.  The face of these cufflinks is nice.  Smooth metal and does not look too cheap.  The back of the cufflink was bent.  These are not cufflinks I would wear to a formal occasion.  For what I do, I can wear them on an ordinary workday.  The bent backs do not make these unusable, however, it is a bit annoying.
B00AERKHMA|5|Love it. Sturdy, tough work shirts.
B003JH8TFO|5|I like it. The power of Elvis compels me!
B00CTRSC34|2|This dress is so cute. And flattering on short waisted  women.<br />I had to give this away to my daughter who is smaller that me.<br /><br />It is Asian manufactured and their sizes are small. I ordered the correct size as indicated. I even measured myself. However, the bust squished me in.<br /><br />If you order this product be sure to be very generous in your measurement to allow movement room!<br />Material is fine.<br /><br />I would order again except I don't think they have the next size up.
B007IASS9U|5|This dress is awesome even though I had to return it to get a size larger. It was small even though I had the measurements according to the sizing chart. But the company was so incredibly awesome as they quickly exchanged the dress within days of receiving the return. Now it fits perfect and looks absolutely beautiful. It also came with a matching scarf/wrap. Nice surprise!
B007XD8W0W|5|We love these for infants. Give them as gifts and friends love them too.
B00LBKS94M|5|Excellent!
B00HWRR4YE|3|The mesh is comfortably stretchy and accentuate your package well while the overall cut is good. But don't order the yellow and red pattern unless you want to be reminded of McDonald's every time you put them on. &#34;Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-baaa! I'm not loving it.&#34;
B00L286XEG|3|Love the fir collar but not the lack of snaps. I am returning it because it was a bit disappointing. I usually like Larry Levine coats but this one isn't one of them.
B01049FGFA|1|Cool design is about best I can say.  I'm a big girl, and wear a 2x in my tops. Bought this in 2x, and felt more like an XL.  Gave it to my niece who is smaller than me, it fit her, but when she was pulling over her head, her thumb went right through the material.  Waste of money. Poor quality.
B00E1JM8WY|1|Way to small and fabric is cheap. i ordered an xtra large there's no way. its more like a small. i love amazon though
B00E9QZQ14|3|the cups dug into my arm pits
B00GR8XFH4|5|The color is great and I like that it is a v neck. Fit just like I thought it would!
B005PKP87U|5|Great material, beautiful...  well made.  Loved it! My daughter looks beautiful in it. I ordered 3 more in different colors and sizes for my daughter.
B00BYQUHMA|5|love the feel of the fabric.  I have a big bust and spare tire gal.  This gives me shape instead of my cover ups.  Husband loves it on me
B00JBXXEZU|4|Cute
B00ARDCES6|5|These fit my daughter perfectly. The elastic fit her wrists well enough where they do not fall off easily without pinching her skin.
B004M6XUI2|5|This wallet is well made.  It has a very professional look  and the interior is very functional.  I would highly recommend it.
B00PZVDFFQ|5|Fits great and so cute :)
B007OWEPNU|1|a size M that seems a XXXL
B00JW0B2YW|5|love this belt its awsome
B002N3AMCS|4|The one size fits all, typically means it will be too large on me as I am a petite woman.  This is not a negative, just a fact for me.  The overall custom is very cute, the antenae, however, coming out of the package are laying flat.  I have left the headpiece out of the package until Halloween in hopes that they still springback.  You do need to purchase separately the leggings and shirt for underneath.  Wings could be a bit larger and more realistic.<br /><br />Overall Happy!
B00OM5P6M6|5|Perfect fit.  My husband loves them and enjoys going swimming in them.
B0057VTQ48|4|This just arrived and it is truly beautiful. The quality and the workmanship are excellent. there is only one problem and that seems to be an every day occurrence in the clothes made overseas. I bought a Medium different brand the other day and it is a little small. As I am rapidly loosing weight  - on purpose - I ordered a large in this brand. I have just laid them on top of each other - they are exactly the same size - so, a Bloomingdale Medium and a Williams Large are identical in size! Oh well
B00CZ580U0|1|I really like the look they're well made and the price is great .<br />But their not for men there sizes run very small like there &#34;Childrens pants&#34; very disappointed ;(
B0007CKJW0|5|Bought these for my husband - they fit as expected and he looks great in them. Love a guy in Wranglers :)
B00MPCPVVY|3|It would be great if they offered a US XL, as it is a slim fit.
B00JJIHY30|3|Not as long as I thought, but I still like it. :)
B002808UT8|5|Absolutely gorgeous, comfortable and shapely...A head turner for real
B00HVBHWQ6|3|The socks did not fit my foot well, they are not snug so not easy to perform exercises with.  Not very pleased but they look pretty on!!
B00N9QCQWM|1|Doesn't fit like the picture shows and fits really really big. I needed for a vacation in the sun and I don't think I will wear it
B00A1A8NGW|4|Still cute for what I needed it for.
B000T7YOV0|5|Great Fit for my plus size 8 year old. She weighs 90lbs. She has a 26in waist and a 26 inseam. She would probably kill me (lol) if she knew I posted this, but if it helps someone else then she would be happy. I ordered her a 10 1/2. We both like the fact that she can bend over and not have her girl business showing.
B009RT6MKC|3|This T-Shirt material is a bit thin or sheer. This was not expected based on the product description. Silkscreen imprinting is not straight either, but was probably intended due to the BBT theme. It's Okay, just not the best.
B009QPT1YG|4|Bought these as gift for my college age daughter.  She love the fleece lining.  I think she will get a lot of wear from them.
B00K7W2G7G|1|Cheap quality  :(
B005CSNVU6|4|not saggy in the backside like other sweat pants. very athletic styling and comfortable.
B00EO21RWU|4|Good looking, runs a bit lose
B001716XZW|4|Wore them on a 10 hour flight, wonderful fit and movement.
B000JHHF3O|4|Very difficult size to find for my husband, being 6 '4&#34; having a 32 Carhartt fit him well and they hold up while he is working.
B0009MM3IG|5|I've had all different brands of golf windshirts from PGA, Ashworth and even Wal-mart. This is definitely one one of the best if not the best. The only item that could make it better would be zip away sleeves. The fit and quality are excellent!
B003AKHPWI|5|My boyfriend loves this.  He had me order him another one so he could have a work hat and a going out hat.
B00KE26V3E|4|I love it , but it did nothing to flatter my tummy. I thought the stripes would mask it, but it did the exact opposite.
B008MZPX4I|4|Sturdy, smooth, comfortable, easy to use.  You will still need to get the keys on the smaller rings... Can use it for other things like USB sticks on their mini-lanyards.  As with most reviewers, wish it came with more rings and was lower cost - hence minus one star.
B0091FZ3H0|5|Amazing band shirts and great service as always. I love Rockabilia. I've purchased 4 Otep t-shirts from Rockabilia and they are my favorite shirts now. Otep is so amazing!
B00CR2EAMI|1|The sleeves did not seem in correct proportion to the rest of the shirt
B00D3EPTB0|5|These pants are super soft!
B00NFYJ0ZY|5|I am very happy with the cardigan. Got one for Christmas and got damaged so glad I was able to find it and purchase it again.
B00KQHA12Y|4|I like everything about this except-the length. I'm 5'6 and it fits me more like a dress than a tunic. It looks awkward as a shirt with jeans, which was my intention. I find it better used as a dress with black stockings and heeled booties!
B00DU4BN18|4|I wanted a stylish maternity jacket and couldn't find one. This is NOT supposed to be a maternity coat, so I bought one size up from my pre-preg size. It's full skirt and button placements allow my month 7 belly and behind to fit comfortably. I've had it for about a month now. I love the gold buttons, and the color is great. It is more of a berry color than red.  I like it so much I will wear it next winter when I'm not pregnant. You can never have too many coats in New England.<br /><br />Small negatives, when I drive, the buckle on the back can push into the top part of my back (above the shoulder blades). Also the neck isn't lined, so you will want to wear a scarf. It is a bit heavy, but it is a winter coat after all.
B00HMOS716|5|It fits great.
B00KQ21JMU|5|This set is very pretty and so comfortable.  I will be ordering it again.  I highly recommend this set.
B002GPVF0Q|1|The bra is missing-it's just an ordinary tank. Color is cute.  I'm a tiny person so the size fits perfectly well.
B0085JHW2M|1|These were waaaay too small. I tried to put them on my 1-day old, 8 lb newborn girl and they were much too tiny. Luckily I bought the 6 -month size at the same time, and those fit fine (a little on the roomy side).  I think these make a great little gift, but I would advise everyone to buy the bigger size.
B00J3LR2LW|4|I love the shirt and everything about it! The graphics on it are perfect and the colors all are there as like the picture. The only downside that keeps it from a perfect 5-star rating would be that it doesn't fit right—It's a size too small. So buy a size bigger than what you are!
B00062NHIO|5|ok
B00YXLZWVY|1|This shirt was half the size it should have been with no size printed in the neck.  I ordered XXL and it was about a medium.  It cost be $14.06 to send it back.  Very disappointed all the way around.  Plus I had to wait several weeks to get it.
B00KQFW6LK|5|I love this sweater!  It looks great on and is very comfy. It runs a tad small though. I bought a medium and am glad I did.
B00BUACQII|2|I had previously bought a pair of level 99 jeans and loved them but these were way too low rise and not mid rise like advertised and also way too short. I had to return them. Better for shorter women
B0034DP3ZW|4|it came in on time it looked really good and my aunt really loves it she wears it all the time
B00LP2XKMC|5|It is as I had expected it would be.  No complaints.
B000HAMITE|5|Great outfit! I didn't like the hat, but the jumpsuit was perfect. Yes it is a little short. I am 5'5 and it was short on me, but if you wear some crazy socks, it will look fine. Also, the jumpsuit is see through so be careful what you wear under it!
B007MY656U|4|This bra is comfortable and good for low impact. I would have given it 5 stars if it was lined for modesty.
B00K9GOV32|1|These pads were not made for a large breasted women.  I'm over 60 and wanted an uplift.  These pads got lost in my bra and did absolutely nothing.
B00APLPWFC|5|It's more than a belt, it's a statement made to last. Worth every penny!
B00S0P6EUM|2|Below average product. No pocket and has a cheap sheen. Not worth the money. I wouldn't buy it again.
B00MBMF9LA|4|Great my mom loves them.
B00JP93TVY|5|Excellent quality.  The company is willing to work with you to get the proper fit.
B00B70IC6G|5|Excellent value for so small a price !! Pattern and material work with all types of outfits! Wish I had ordered more for gifts!
B00MHN9MR0|5|Love these shirts supper soft my baby is very comfortable in them.
B000KRX80M|5|Really cool. It's heavy AND oiled.
B0006U68BY|5|they were a little to small.  sorry had to return
B00BCYDSLQ|5|This dress is absolutely gorgeous!! When on it puffs out beautifully. Perfect for a birthday, however would be better if they had a 12 months not 12-18 months.
B008NE06Z4|5|I like this shirt because it shows a real animal (warthog) on a fine quality t shirt that fits quite well.  The shirt washes well (cold water gentle cycle) and is a bargain for the price.
B00N48JFR4|5|excelente
B008M5LO6O|1|The product does exactly what it is designed for to give that slim effect but the fabric material used is of poor quality.  The first 2 l purchased tore in a matter of days. Its just too cheaply made and sold at that price.
B00HERJRW4|5|love them
B000YASX1E|4|Made real well , better than we expected , especially since it was priced so low
B00O72XF36|1|The bra feels like paper it is to small I didn't like the way the bra looked or feel the material is cheap definitely not worth buying it's a complete waste of money will not purchase again I give it no stars well I had to give one star just to submit my review
B00IDESSKY|3|The mask itself is beautiful.  I received many compliments, however the eye holes were just a bit to narrow.  Nothing that I couldn't get past, it just a personal preference.  Over all the mask was good.
B002OGZQFC|5|I saw this coat on the today show and I just had to have it even if I'm not a twilight fan. After reading some of the previous reviews saying that this jacket runs a bit small I bought a medium which fits well even if it is a little big. My only problem is that I have really long arms and the sleeves seem to run a bit short. I love all the pockets on this coat and the material is very durable.
B005DJ8HCQ|5|My husband is quite the handyman, so this was just too cute to pass up.  I'm glad I bought it!
B00EH3BTP6|4|I love the dress, fits perfectly but it is a bit more purple than blue. I may look around for something very similar that is mostly blue as I intended this as a wedding dress and I need blue.<br />if I can't find one I'll use it. Very beautiful but I feel the advertisement is a bit misleading.<br />if n
B005XLTH32|5|FIT PERFECTLY AND SO COMFY
B00DGO9WIS|5|got this for my girlfriend and she loved it. i wanted to keep it. ugh it was her birthday though. they also have the piccolo one which i shall get.
B001MWRZ8U|5|Very comfortable; fit well and looked good with my white 3 piece and the black & gray bow tie: a hit at the wedding!
B005XBXO9U|1|This was so tiny. I ordered queen and it was like a small, very tight and unattractive.  I will not order anything again from them.
B00T83GNAG|5|Great shirt fits very well
B00FR868XI|5|I am a fair skinned blonde and wasn't sure this was the right color for me. I usually look very washed out in grey but silver just was great for me. I liked the sleeve length: not too long but not too short. The wedding is in May in the Northwest so any temperature is possible on the big day. I am looking forward to the full skirt on the dance floor!
B005DL1XQQ|4|I like this jeans too much, and this is my first baby jeans we expect she enjoy a lot.<br /><br />Thanks
B00AOCWJU8|4|It fits kind of small. I order medium I it seems a Small. The fabric is an ok product. .
B005PZ1R0M|5|I couldnt believe how many girls in Cali wear this tee! its totally flattering and goes great with anaything!! HOTTT!
B000JHHEG2|5|I bought these for my nephew who is short and stocky. He's a very hard child to buy pants for,but liked  how the looked and fit him.
B0051D4OX0|4|Great fit! These are my go too jeans for working in the yard.
B00JE2ZYZG|5|comfy
B00NARBGQ2|4|I like the dress, but the material is very thin.  The picture does not give that appearance.
B002J243XM|5|love this dress. fits really well on my tiny frame. color is a little different in person but thats okay, very feminine and sexy. didn't care for the panty it came with--doesn't matter :)
B00F617B1O|5|Purchased this shirt for my man. He's 5'11. 190LBS. Average body. I ordered a Large, will be able to dry. Wash on delicate to make sure the emblem does not crack and don't dry it every time to help with that was well. Wash inside out. Shirt looks just like the picture. True to color.
B009M63C1C|5|I like the color on my ear muffs.
B00FWDR7QK|5|Very nice ski jacket. Highly recommended:)
B009LP4Y20|5|very good
B00IVCYQRC|5|This is my first Lucky shirt to order from Amazon. I am so excited to be able to find my Lucky Brand on-line, especially from my most trusted  site!!! It fits great and I adore it, but it is smaller than my other Lucky shirts. I am a size six and I wear a small. The waist is tighter than my other small Lucky shirts, so I could have ordered a medium in this particular one. It fits fine, just keep in mind that it is not as roomy as most of the other styles.
B008A9JQS0|5|I wasn't sure how my daughter (9) would receive this particular gift, because she is not a &#34;girly-girl&#34; and doesn't usually go for pink and purple.  However, she loves alpacas, and this was a relatively inexpensive way to give her something made with alpaca wool. She loves the white alpaca designs and loves the style of hat.  Although she avoids wearing too much pink and purple, she has proudly worn her hat out several times even though it's not cold yet.  The hat is well-made and fits her perfectly.  Also, I love how it was packaged.  My daughter used a lot of the creative packaging as bookmarks.
B00DWUZKZK|5|the skirt is amazing, shiney and sparkely, the colors are deep and bright and the velvet soft. My 4 year old dranddaughter loves it !
B00FG18E6A|5|is awwwwsooommemeeeeeeeeee  i love it ....is was fit soo good. i would recomended to my friends in.. also great price!!
B00CID8LVC|4|Love the outfit, just sized a little off.  Happy with the exchanged item and much better fit ! AWESOME
B00EYT4GAS|5|It looks just like the photo. It's a little baggy in the back, making it look more feminine. It stays on very well.
B00D5WWTXQ|4|PROS: All the pockets make it very convenient, Coins are held snug, plenty of pockets and slots, and looks good<br /><br />CONS: Your id will stick out a fraction of a cm from its pocket. And the brown version is a little darker than depicted. And it gets thick and bulky fast due to coin pocket<br /><br />Overall a great wallet if these dont bother you!
B00DR3R1YU|5|I'm glad that I had order the wings. The flow of the fabric is perfect. I'm definitely pleased. It help dramatizes dance routines.
B00PGZOH7G|3|I read the reviews in advance and knew that it ran small so I ordered a size up and the body of it fit fine.  My concern is with the opening to get my head through - it was very small.  Furthermore, the neckline is not scalloped like it is in the photo. The edges are jagged and does not seem to follow a pattern.  The shirt is cute, but not soft and &#34;pretty&#34; as I expected.
B00DTHQJA6|4|My kids adore their 'candy cane' pajamas as they call them.  The only complaint is that the pocket on the sweatshirt is too small to put hands in, and the top overall runs a tad small.  I am still very happy with this purchase.
B00DTRXSIM|4|I bought this wallet for my hubby who was in desperate need of a new wallet.  He used to be a vendor and had been carrying a wallet on a chain for years.  It is a bit hard to find wallets with a chain so when I saw this I showed it to him and he liked it.  When the wallet arrived I checked it out and found it to be well made with nice leather, also loved the color.  His last wallet did not have a zipper so I knew this would take a bit of getting used to.  He has been carrying this for around a month.  He is not wild about the zipper but feels that things in his wallet are more secure because of that..  The biggest complaint that he has is the thickness of the wallet.  This is much thicker than what he was used to carrying.  There are plenty of pockets etc. inside which might be nice for some, but in my hubby's case it is overkill, just not necessary...for example- a coin pouch.  He always slips his coins in the front pocket of his jeans, not his wallet.  Had they left out a few things like that it could have been a 5 star wallet.  As it is, I can only give it 4 stars because it is just too thick for him...a nice and well made wallet, just not perfect!
B003U591UC|5|Just what I was looking for!  This is an excellent wallet.  Beautiful craftsmanship.
B00BJOGM58|2|The material is warming but there is no style to these pajamas.  I'm sure they look the same on everyone: Boxy.
B00AHMES5E|5|This fabric is SO soft! I love it so much! I have the shorts and pants. Feels like you don't have anything on. I'm getting these in different colors! Love this brand!
B0072Z1UCS|4|I opened this for Christmas and loved it, however, I thought a men's medium would fit me but it seems to run a bit small and fits a bit snug. Guess it's time to loose a bit of weight to enjoy it!
B00MZEZRUC|4|For the most part, I really like the Utopia Wear Women's Yoga Ankle Legging. They have a nice feel to them. The yoga ankle leggings do run a little small in my opinion. They do fit; however, it is quite the process getting into them. Due to this, the yoga ankle leggings will mostly be used in the winter, when layers are necessary. These will be great when it comes to going out, shoveling, and snow blowing, as they will easily be able to be worn under snow pants. In addition, they can be worn under jeans when it is cold out. The yoga ankle leggings seem to wash rather well. They do have a comfortable fit, even if they are a tad tighter than I am use to. Either way, I would definitely recommend the Utopia Wear Women’s Yoga Ankle Legging, especially for the price!<br /><br />*I was sent the item in exchange for my honest opinion. All the opinions expressed here are my own.*
B0061IE0VU|5|I have a long-torso and small bust.  Ordered the size 6 and it fits well.  A fuller busted girl can wear this as well as you won't bubble over the top.  Beautiful material and very well made.  Ordered the navy...nice change from black.  The cut on the boyleg is ingenious as it hides any flaw you may have from the &#34;rear-view&#34;.  Probably one of the very best suits I have ever owned and I'm finally able to take off the cover-up and look presentable.  Go for it girls...you won't be disappointed!
B00J0PXTJU|4|I love this shirt, it is soft, and looks good. The only issue is the the neck opening is a little on the small side - at least for my son. Otherwise it's a; great shirt.
B001283M0Y|5|From the fit in the waistband to the construction in the crotch for great support and around your legs, fits perfect to perfection. I have tried many brands and nothing equals Calvin Klein.
B002R0FBXC|4|The &#34;T&#34; size says &#34;2-4&#34; on the size chart. My daughter is 3 and somewhat small.  She wears a size 3 in clothes, but we still have a lot of size 2 clothing that she wears.  I should have bought the size &#34;S&#34; instead of &#34;T.&#34;  The leg holes are really tight around her thighs.  I think the only reason she agrees to wear it is because she loves being a ballerina.  The leotard section is a really soft cotton, and the skirt is super light and flow-y (I think I just made up a word!)  The quality is good, I just wish we would have ordered the next size up.
B000MNHMJM|2|it was alot smaller than expected. and there is a strange lump on the top that isn't symetrical to the other side
B001IBKPLO|5|My teenage son got these for Christmas and really loves them. The sizing is accurate. Great product at a great price.
B0088PLA0I|5|I love the way they fit and the feel of the material.  I think my legs look great in them & so in return I feel great.
B00CRBYC36|5|I love these socks. I will be buying more. They are warm, but not too warm that my feet sweat. They are very comfortable and have come in handy with ALL the snow New England has been getting!!!
B004445ANK|1|Honestly too small, have not opened 2 of them, would return if not for hassle, will probably donate to charity and go to Mens Wearhouse. Makes the $90 Prime seem not worth it.
B00D8VKWTC|2|really was much different  than the photo .I didn't like and the materials were so thin like a dolls dress .I never buy again clothes with bad reviews
B00H36NAVK|5|Love the color! Delivered fast! It fits my kids perfectly! Ordered 2 and looked good on them. Thank you!!!
B00BXAQXHU|4|Rides low on the waist line but the material is super comfy and feels great on ;)<br />Also it is a mesh material so it will be slightly see through<br />Once again super awesome to wear for long periods of time.
B00CL02O3S|5|i love this blouse and i get lots of compliments on it. great fit. Nice look. I loe the fabric and the quality.
B00GOKNTMQ|5|Exceeded expectations. Thank you!
B004J0XXFG|5|Wow! Amazing...really recommend it to everyone out there looking for an abaya/long dress. My friend came over to my house and she wore this abaya and was so happy since she was looking for a place to buy nice , quality Abayas for a long time and finally, she has found one. This seller has very reasonable prices and good quality clothes.
B00ULP75Z2|5|excellent quality tie! Super cool and fair trade! AMAZING!
B00AHCIC06|1|Bought these a second time - hoping for a better fit.  WRONG!  I have Khaki, Black, Navy, and Mocha, and they all fit perfectly.  Why are these (and an Olive pair that I ordered earlier) constructed so differently??  The legs are not even close to the cut on my others!  They are tapered so badly, they actually cling to my lower leg!  WHY??
B0055PK3R0|5|This worked really well for my teenage son.  It was just what he wanted both for dress and casual wear.
B00CEIMHA2|1|These undergarments fit terrible. They run horribly small. They are binding at the legs and very very thin. I wish I could have bought one or two pair to try them out first. Now I have wasted money on six pair. The tag is sewn in on the front and back and is itchy. They are just awful.
B00363ZFE4|5|These pads are the highest quality I've ever owned and they make my clothes fit just like I want them to - just enough lift to make everything else on me look smaller :)<br /><br />I had recently purchased another brand that were wedge style and disliked them because they made me look like a football player.  These are far superior and the material looks like it will last for years.
B001R4C98E|5|I boutht the athletic crew socks for my grandson who is 3 years old and they are very good quality socks.
B00FEQ60KY|3|This item is a gift. I will have to wait to discover the fit.  It was exactly as described in looks and came as a set .
B00IE93W8G|4|My son was very happy with his lightening McQueen outfit. The graphic had a very small crack and is the reason for 4 stars instead of five.
B005P87CTY|5|I like the fact that it comes with cufflinks. It's a very beautiful colored shirt as well. I saw this in the Thalen Kane Elegant Casual Style for Men novel.
B007EWZNI6|2|Tese pants are built with an extremely harsh fabric, they feel hard and tough.  In fact, upon receiving it I became aware that they are constructed for automotive workshop use.
B001AS6D02|5|This item was impressive very durable and can reused them with out falling off . I would recommend this product to people.
B00ER6U184|4|I am 5'9&#34; and a curvy size 16 on the bottom. This dress is tight, but really hot. I love it in black, so I bought it in blue too!
B009E7SSSQ|5|My back has been aching of late, so I bought this corset as an alternative to those fat-ifying back support devices I've been wearing.<br /><br />It arrived today, on the earliest end of the estimated delivery date. I opened, laced, and put it on immediately.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the ample width of the back flap (I'm sure it has a name but I don't know it). If there is not enough fabric, skin shows through and it becomes necessary to fold it back or look silly. I've done both in the past. Neither is pleasant. They didn't cut corners here, and I'm thrilled.<br /><br />This corset is absolutely beautiful and makes me feel beautiful wearing it (even over yoga pants and a tank top). The curve lines extending to my not-corseted body are very smooth; the flare at the hips is not met with an upside-down &#34;muffin top.&#34; My hips are a bit flabby, so this was a pleasant and unexpected surprise. There is a full 11&#34; difference between my waistline and the bottom-most hook of the corset, noting that the thickness of the corset itself was included in the waist measurement while most of the bottom measurement was on bare skin. It's visually striking without appearing (or feeling) uncomfortable.<br /><br />The fabric is rich, both in looks and touch. The bones are measured and secured such that there are no pointy bits that irritate. I'm very short-waisted and have had problems with corsets riding up when I'm sitting. If you've ever had the end of an underwire poke through its enclosure, you know what that feels like. I've been sitting in this corset for over an hour now and have not experienced that problem. I'd given up hope of ever driving in one, even as a passenger, but this one seems quite compatible with being seated.<br /><br />Note to those new to underbust corsets: Plan to spend a bit of time finding the right shirt to wear under it. You definitely don't want buttons being pressed into your skin, even though some corset ads show them. I thinkthere is a reason that ShaperCorset sells http://www.amazon.com/Renaissance-Chemise-Medieval-Peasant-SC88523A/dp/B005O3UYBS/ as well.
B00R4WTKNA|5|Talls fit great!!!!!!  I have long legs.
B000BVXZ3M|5|I like the quality and they fit well.
B0067FKBMO|5|Enough room for my cards, photos, etc. Fit nicely so I do not have to worry about one falling out. Rich feel to the leather. Very pleased!
B004RWTWSI|4|This was part of my daughters sixteenth birthday celebration, she is a huge black veil brides fan! She loved it!
B00N3H3PFO|5|Love these pants; would buy in every color if available in my size.
B00CACKMKO|1|Love the look.  Wore twice, they fell apart.
B007OWEMG0|5|Pricey, but very nice material and washable, 2nd pair I ordered and fit a little big but like it loose.
B007FG0PXY|5|True to size love the color
B0069RKU1W|3|This hat is a lot smaller then I thought. Its smaller on top then it shows in the picture, but it is still cute and seems like good quality. Its thick and lined.
B007AISF70|4|I am happy with my WHite Morphsuit that I have purchased and received. The fit is very close to perfect, and mobility is not rescrited in the slightest, perhaps even enhancces it. However visibility out of the eye area is not quite up to par, and unless there are many light souces around you may find youself stumbling aound- but as I said with light source you will be just fine. I am using mah morphsuit in my cosplay and as the main piece of clothing for my superheor/vigilante costume. Overall I was very pleased with this suit, but must doct a point for a low visibily. Ranking: 4* B+<br /><br />Ramon
B00KD33970|5|Colors are a bit brighter but Great dress
B00N214IHU|4|👍
B00AK3ZD0Y|3|My son wears a perfect 32 but it is too small. Returned for a 33. Nothing more to say. Ok
B003LBTB5U|5|These compression shorts are very well made and true to size. I liked them so much, I got 5 pairs total. For those looking for help with sizing, I'm a 40 waist and the XL fit fine. If in doubt, go one size bigger!
B009E5T8CI|5|I love this robe!! I have a &#34;Stan Herman&#34;, all cotton robe made by this pattern, that I bought in the '90s that needed to be replaced. I have looked everywhere for one like my Stan Herman robe, or so I thought I had looked everywhere. One night I was looking on Amazon and the thought occurred to me that you sold robes, so I looked and there was MY robe. I don't like the way  those fleece robes feel on me, this robe is 70% cotton  and the robe feel great on!! Thank you very much for having my robe on your website!!<br /><br />Mary F. Slaten
B000MX0F32|5|Playtex has alway been my preferred brand of bras but many stores don't carry them anymore. I wear a 42DD and find it easier to put on a front closer and it is also more comfortable than a back close bra.  This bra with the flex back is the best bra that I have purchased in years. Shopping on Amazon.com was good because the price was right and the bra arrived on time.
B0058XDL3C|5|Always a good throwback choice.  They wear very well.  This company was quick and precise.  Not much more you can ask from a vendor.
B00BKNKRQ8|1|I was excited to get this cap. Once it arrived and I removed it from the packaging, I was immediately disappointed. It looked great until you viewed it from the cap bill. The bill was sewn on crooked to the left of center. RETURNED IMMEDIATELY.
B009YLR3W4|5|warm
B003GXFTMM|4|Met my expectations
B002750G32|5|This belt is a quality product at a great price. The small shop who makes them is local and I had to return it because I ordered the wrong size thinking that the belt like other belts I've ordered in the past would be cut smaller because of overseas production... not so. This belt is true to size. The small shop who makes it in rural PA graciously took back the belt, offered to make me another one at the right size and ship it to me free. I liked it so much I ordered another one in a different color.
B00062NFIG|5|I love that this underwear is all black. Fits great.  I hate white underwear and looked for longer than I expected to find a pack that wasn't a variety pack with one black pair.
B00G255OAS|2|I ordered an XL to make sure that the shirt would be roomy, but it is skin tight.  I will probably be returning this item.
B00QN68PI4|4|beautiful dress fits just right and sexxy too
B00KRFXTZG|5|Hubby loves it.
B00I86GEZI|5|This is a very nice and very sexy shirt ! Definitely gets you noticed highly recommend! And I love MM !
B00EM971AC|1|the dress is too short for me and the color is really horrible. not at all a pretty dress.
B00ATFC9VE|5|I ordered this shirt right before leaving on a week long vacation...the anticipation of waiting to wear it nearly killed me. As soon as I returned home I eviscerated the packaging to reveal the glory of this fine piece of apparel. It has exceeded all my wildest dreams that I had about it whilst on vacation. Not only does it fit well, but I find that people stare and turn green with envy.<br /><br />I have also noticed that this shirt makes me invincible*! My enemies are instantly subdued by the hypnotizing moon beams and the trifecta of grumpy cats clustered so close together. The majesty of the experience is to great to sum up with words, you must buy this shirt and experience it for yourself.<br /><br />*Actual invincibility may vary
B00EG8F1W4|5|fitting good. slightly tight. feel awesome!
B00192UY9A|5|They work.
B00DGEK7K0|5|This is my first time buying for lolita blouses (I also ordered at the same time a white long-sleeve blouse).<br />I was a little worried that this store would send me a cheap fabric blouse but, really, this blouse's fabric will endure!<br /><br />I tried it on as soon as I got the package, it has lace in the back to make it more adjustable to the body.<br /><br />I ordered a small based on THEIR measuring table, I am ~100lbs, 5ft 1in height, and am 23 years old, the blouse(s) fit just as described, the measurements are just like an American measurement you expect to find in Mall stores and Wal-mart, so you are in no risk of getting 'too small' or 'too big'. I prefer buying INSIDE THE COUNTRY than outside, you avoid getting hit by customs, Air Mail over seas, and possibly receiving an open package. This seller has me on the bag, I will order from them again, the skirts are beautiful and I hope that this has helped any Lolita who wishes to buy for sturdy fabric from a reliable store with good reviews.<br /><br />Price is worth it!
B00ELN1A4M|5|Great product !
B00EB4SAYY|4|Runs long, thus the 4-star rating. I had to move two buttons wayyyy up high on the straps so my son could wear it the first time. Otherwise, they're precious.
B00K54Y9NA|5|This was a birthday present for an 11 year old.  Huge success!
B00KDQ92HS|5|not bad for the price, looks pretty, are warm and the most important, it works! love them :)
B00BJJJC1O|5|very nice t-shirt, and the quality of the material is very pleasant, but the size is very large .. If you do not want a very large size, then take exactly your size but no more.
B00B79DY9M|5|Thank you fruit of the loom!! My 6 year daughter loves all things superheroes and always asks why girls underwear can't have cool characters on them like boys underwear.  I usually don't have an answer, girls underwear SHOULD have cool characters too.  Not all girls like princesses and the color pink.  I love that Fruit of the Loom has shown girls they can like superheroes and wear them too!  Score one for the girls!!!
B0009GCROW|5|These are very nice quality tshirts that hold up great after washing. I love these shirts to sleep in.
B008EHNO9U|5|I absolutely love this outfit and so does my little boy. The color is really beautiful and I always get compliments on it. The design looks really high end and I love the detail on the feet. I can't wait to order items.
B00IUFZC78|5|Absolutely loved this so much better than the picture! Fit well and very very cute! love it!
B00E99RBBY|2|The sweater isn't that great. Fit is boxy and shapeless and makes me look bigger than I am.  I don't want to be bothered to return it but I cannot picture myself wearing this very much.
B00CE58UB0|4|I would really like more support. But it's ok for the price!
B003X0B7IS|1|Not true to size in the waist. Many seams ripped out within a few months. The overall quality is poor, not recommended at all.
B00DCS4SFU|5|High Quality material and the boy shorts are snug enough that they don't ride up but don't cut off your circulation.  Great deal!
B006CCKXHK|5|I just got this in the mail today (fast shipping I must say) and I am in love with it! My Breast Cancer Awareness lanyard was wearing out, so I had to get a new one. Oh my gosh, this lanyard is so VIBRANT and colorful! I'm in love, Sailor Moon = my childhood. Material is way better than my BCA lanyard, it's so soft. Goodness I might want to buy another one!!
B003XTHUNK|5|OKAY, SO I bought this costume for my friend's birthday  its reallly awesome!!! its really cute and soft.  It may be big if your height is smaller than 163.  Because I tried wearing it, but its kinda too big
B008UC7R7E|5|Beautiful!
B002BAXBGC|4|Very soft, nice color too.
B00502BCSM|5|Looks great on, very classic and timeless style. Holds up well and love the extra length!
B00KUO9L9C|5|Love it just need to lose to fit in it but that's a good thing .
B00DQNIF5A|4|4.5<br />EVERYTHING WAS PERFECT<br />EXCEPT SOME STRAWS LOOSE AND STRING gets dirty over time
B00NAW0GKO|1|The shirt I received did not look like this!  Looked more like a regular t-shirt.  But a vest style.  Was Told to give it to someone else if I didn't like it.
B00AKQO3XY|2|Received tan capris that were not cargo pants and not grey as advertised. Don't really like tan or the fit.
B001GBFFZM|5|simple, comfortable, fits as expected - I would recommend this
B00FP88072|4|Hystericla and awesome. Slinky strethcy fabric. Dug it lots... cheap but perfect for me.
B0028S5YLW|5|I like a nice snug fit in my socks so they don't creep down.  These are perfect for my size 10 feet
B00OW64XJW|1|I love the pattern and feel of this shirt -- but it was way too short. Had to return.
B008E17QIQ|4|My son loves this tshirt.
B00PMJJDKW|5|My husband loves this length short and here in Southern California we live in shorts.
B003S9VV12|2|Comfortable, fits well, soft fabric. A bit of a jumble as a cargo pant though. The back pockets are completely open, and there is only one large side pocket, above the knee on the outside of the thigh, hidden and zipped - nice. And one pencil pocket on the opposite leg. They are going back.
B00MVWZYM4|4|Fit as expected
B00P9QPJHE|3|I have four other colors of leggings from mopas and they all fit fine but these were too small and kept sliding down all night. Not sure why they're different. Got my others from a different site so maybe they're sized differently.
B00V27PZVE|4|Nice fit firm waist and tummy support with good uplifting bust support.
B004NP4UKE|5|These scrubs fit great. They look good. The only downside is that there is no zipper.
B00OJE5JYA|5|Zombies....great for cardio.
B00NHTVSW0|2|cut slim
B00E4EJF72|3|I like the dress but the material clings and the collar is ill fitting. I don't care for item that are tight around the hips . And I bought it 2 sizes larger for that reason. The color is a beautiful red.
B00GAWWN3Y|5|my boy likes the cloth, I likes the cloth, I will buy the cloth else. very good. i likes the red monkey
B00KJ74KD2|5|This Came To Me Super Fast. Which Made Me Very Happy. Its Great Super Cute. I Would Recommend Its A Cheap Price And Its Cute. The Bottom Opening Is A Big Large But Its Still Cute.
B0015QX1FO|3|I received the item in a small bag, it was all curled up, I hated it, the buttons were loose, I wasn't going to return it so I sew a few buttons, it's cheaply made the material is shabby looking,I learned to love it ,looks nice on with jeans,but you defiantly need a camisole under it, the picture and the description doesn't do any justice.
B00SF749DY|5|went larger due to reviews and my breast size - fits pretty good though. one underwire is slightly coming out but I think I can fix it.
B000J9YQOS|3|A better drawstring would be better very hard to tie
B00IUGDCVK|4|Good value for the money.  Only thing I would change is the side pocket closers, velcro instead of snaps.
B00SZ0IYA0|5|I'm restocking my Summer pj wardrobe and finally got these after price fluctuation drop.  I am so glad I did.  I LOVE them.  They are soft and comfortable, cool and fresh and nice blend of fabrics that doesn't make it too slippery or like ur wearing under clothes.  The fit is great.  I like roomy tops so usually get a large but large bottoms are usually too big, these are perfect.  The shorts are not too short but the top is a little longer than I thought it would be but thats fine.
B000LECB3E|1|I purchased this hoodie as a gift for my nephew who loves Abercrombie.  Turned out to be fake Abercrombie.  Now I am out the shipping cost of the hoodie in both directions!  And, the return had to go to Vancouver, British Columbia!  This turned into a huge ripoff + an embarrassment for me.
B004SE22H8|4|These look and feel great. I bought the XL and am a large man, but these are a bit roomier than I like. I can tell these are high quality and will probably last me years to come.
B00AWM2JAU|2|Thought I was getting 3-6 months as the option states, but it came 36 months. I guess my daughter can wear it in a few years.
B0085BXMY2|5|I love these!! They fit like i wanted them too, i'm 5'3&#34; and they fit long on me. i might get more later on.
B007CE4ZSA|4|Great costume, very scary, fits as expected and was the hit of the Halloween party. Didn't come with a knife.
B00LCUUAT8|3|This customized key holder looks really nice. The reason I have 3 stars is that the size is very small! I expected sometin bigger.
B000VS7C3Y|1|This product was of very poor quality and could not be used.  The Santa beard was described as \\"Supreme,\\" yet when our \\"Santa\\" tried the beard, it did not fit, was obviously \\"fake\\", and \\"stuck out\\" several inches from the face.  This was a church sponsored event for children, and we were so very disappointed with the beard.  When I contacted the company, their resonse was a \\"no return/refund\\" policy.  We did not expect a \\"life-like\\" beard, however we also did not expect one which was cheap and usable (the cost was $100).  We will never use this company again, and urge others to use caution.
B00ELMLBT2|5|Very cute and just perfect for our twin granddaughters!
B00A6OOIH6|5|Excellent cap. I fell in love with the visor beanie after a thorough playthrough of SSX3. This cap met all my expectations. Warm, yet blocks out high sunlight and looks stylish to boot.<br /><br />My only issue is that it's a lint magnet when put through the wash.
B00BNHIKEM|5|These are truly the best bibs on the market!  They are great quality and extremely durable.  The edges aren't cotton, like some bibs, so they dry super quick.  They can be thrown in the washer and look brand new when they come out.  I wouldn't buy any other bibs!
B00AQ39Y30|4|A bit tight under the arms but surprisingly fits great for 1 size fits all
B00UNFZRB4|4|It's a bit tight by the butt area
B004D7RV7Q|5|I got this robe for my fiance and she absolutely loves it. It's extremely soft and warm. I ordered the purple and the color is what I expected. Great gift for any woman in your life.
B00IBH9YYC|5|Great shirt! Very well-made!
B00HU0C23Q|5|I loved this costume! It fit as expected and was a good quality for the price!  The only downfall - you pretty much have to take it all off to use the bathroom!  I loved it!
B0038BRRLS|5|The best sport bra ever!  I'm an avid outdoors person, from snow skiing to spinning classes this bra delivers.  No bouncing and looks great on!
B003IC2XBQ|4|I used this as a prop for my gangster costume. I have a small to average sized head. This hat was a very tight fit. The hat looks fine for its price and never lost its shape.
B009YI4KLY|5|Very high quality, I can't afford many faconnable clothes but it was on lightning deal during Christmas so I tried it. It is a good buy
B000JGHKBW|4|can't button it, but it's all right  I wish it could be just a little bit lighter beige.
B00550PS20|4|Love these bras, They are comfortable . give great support, wear well and are durable. I purchased one at a department store and it is the best bra I have ever worn. So I went online and bought three more in different colors. I love them! I have thrown out all of my old ones.
B003EEMHTQ|5|I bought this jacket as a replacement for a Medium I ordered that was WAY to big. I am 5'1&#34; and about 110lbs. The medium was HUGE! The size was a M 8/10. The 8/10 part was what should of been put in the description. But I got the Small and it is a 4/6 which is plenty big for me. This jacket is NOT for a tall girl at all. The sleeves will be way to short. On me the sleeves are right at my wrist so I cant stick my hands in the actual sleeve which I tend to do a lot. But the sleeves on the Medium were the same length. This jacket fits me at mid hip and it has shape. It is not boxy. It is fleeced from seam to seam including the hood and the sleeves. I wore it in 30 degree weather and my arms, back and torso were nice and warm. I love this jacket. It's so soft that I could fall asleep in it. I cant tell you how happy I am with this jacket. I wear hoodies daily and this is by far the nicest one.
B00JNUAY7C|5|Love this jacket. Fits and feels great. Do recommend it:)
B000OWF91O|5|I like the lift and support with this bra so much that I recommended it to my active mother. She purchased two of these. I am going to purchase another before they are no longer available. Very difficult to find such high quality at such a reasonable price. Most bras of this caliber sell for 50% more or higher than this price.
B006HSD0YM|5|I am super satisfied the blouse fit perfectly and I love the quality
B00JE906PW|3|A little flimsy for baby clothes but looks super cute.
B009LEFQ1E|5|Love this dress! It was a perfect fit!
B0017MQLX0|5|I tried to purchase this item through another buyer, but after a month of the product allegedly being on back order, I gave up. I then found Rockabilia and I can see myself purchasing from them in the future. The shirt arrived hassle-free and ahead of schedule.
B00KMQGWIG|4|I love love this swimsuit. It is made somewhat cheap but what do you expect for such a good price. I will need to see the bow part on more securely because it is kind of floppy. I wear about a 3/4 in jeans and I'm very small up top so I got a small top and a medium bottom and it fits really well. I just might buy it in another color too!!
B00J2UFDTW|5|Love the jeans. Fits nice and looks good.
B00GYZNHQE|5|A+++++
B002EMF2VY|5|Item arrived in time and in good packing. The material of product is good. Item is as per description and correct sizing. Great item for the deal price.
B00LYLR1UG|4|My daughter loves it, great speed with delivery and strong material
B0001CWZC8|4|These are very nice linen pants but you should order a size or even two larger than your waist for a comfortable fit.  I read another review that suggested they were small, so I ordered a size up and even then they're still tight in the waist.  The inseam was also a little longer than it should have been.  It was a great buy for the price; had I not ordered a size up these would not have fit at all.
B00JVSIILK|5|I love it Thank you!! It's a great business
B0064Y4ET4|4|Great fit and very comfortable.  What more can I say just what I wanted.  Style and comfort is what I wanted
B00MPBJBY8|5|Perfect. Will purchase again.
B00E0G2X1O|5|This fits bigger than expected, but I like how it covers the ears - which helps it stay on better!
B002AQ6CRC|5|Bought these for my husband, his favorite pants.
B000QW6LKK|5|This shaper is great- I've only had it a week and my posture is better. It does tend to &#34;flip&#34; up after I've worn it a while and after sitting down for a bit. I agree with other reviewers that suggest not wearing it under Tighter clothes- it will show the front closure if you do. All in all worth every penny and if it really does reduce my waistline that will be a plus! Will post another review after wearing it for a month.
B00NNPT3NE|4|It's ok. Not quite what I expected.
B00DLLH2VA|4|Fit is big.  Thick and durable material.  I wish these came in different colors.  I'm a girl with curves, so its hard to find such a good fit.
B00D3Q78W6|4|These leggings are very comfy and fit great<br />but tooooooooooooo thin....
B003DAF0PY|5|These gloves are very lightweight and give your hands great dexterity. They are breathable for warmer weather, and would be fine for cooler weather as well. After several times wearing them the grip on the palms and fingers are holding up, unlike some other gloves. Oh, and they look awesome too.
B00D05IZWC|5|Ladies, buy this bra. And then buy 10 more. From the instant I put this on I knew that this bra was THE ONE. So unbelievably comfortable. I'm a C cup and this bra makes the ladies look gooooood-no weird lines, no weird cup shape and the perfect amount of lift. I got one in black and am going back to buy more!
B00I2ZXP2K|2|I ended up giving this skirt to my son's girlfriend. The price I'd paid wasn't worth the trouble of getting a refund. It was just tight all-around. The other skirt I'd ordered was exactly the right size (as listed) and worked perfectly. Going to order more of that one.
B004BFIWVO|5|I've been looking for plus sized dance tights for a while now with no luck. I settled for some Leg Avenue tights...they barely worked. I had a couple near wardrobe malfunctions on stage because of them.  After doing a bit more looking around I stumbled on the Body Wrapper plus size version of these tights. You can't find them here on Amazon, but there are a few dance stores online that do sell the plus size tights. They really are amazing. They're heavy duty and generously cut. I bought the 3x-4x just to be on the safe side since I was on the border between the 2x and 3x....and they are pretty darn roomy. I would bet someone several inches larger around than me (and taller) could fit comfortably in these. There was no slipping and they were a breeze to put on. I would even consider using these for regular tights because they're that awesome.
B007Q9116K|2|Fast shipping! However, we received a white tie instead of the proper blue one... There's three days till our party and we are missing a part of this easy costume. The white tie we received won't do!
B0068DFVDE|5|Very Very , comfortable and really cute.  It's great to sleep in and is a perfect fit.  The price was right and well worth the money.  I highly recommend and have purchased several because they are soo comfortable!
B0116ZQNOE|1|This dress looks like a cheaply made halloween costume. I couldn't wait to get it and was so disappointed! The hem is up so high that even the smallest bust would fit. The arms are tight and the fabric is cheap looking. I wouldn't recommend this dress at all.
B00UM6ZZMK|4|Fits as expected.  It's a little flimsier than I thought it would be, but I did want something lightweight for the TX heat and also inexpensive, so this does fit those categories.
B00CCA5P3S|5|Love love love. Holds well and gives a nice cleavage. The best bra I've ever invested in. My sisters begged me to order for them too. It's amazing

B00HLFXQM6|4|lasted 2 days
B00CGUO2RY|1|I just got my package and it looks horrible! the ears are tiny and look nothing like a bunny. Very disappointed.
B001LNL1SA|4|Got this for little man for parents wedding.  Fit ran a little large but were able roll up pants and jacket was a little difficult to get on but still made it work.
B00CFCVYF6|5|Great bowties!  We bought 2, and they look great!  The price was so low, I was a bit concerned- but they look like they cost much more!  Thank you Tok Tok!
B00ECG6JH6|5|I recommend air drying or they might shrink. So comfortable! and they don't wear out easily like many patterned socks
B000XETY78|2|From the picture it looks like the cape goes over your entire body, but it really is just a shoulder wrap. The rest of your body is uncovered and there are no arm holes like the picture shows
B0041PAVO0|2|It's the cutest hat ever! But unfortunately it was too small for my four year old's head. He's always had a larger than average head, but to say it fits 2-7, that's really pushing it. It's more like to 2-3, it that.
B00HZPSBSG|4|a bit larger than expceted
B000S5D1CG|1|Very cheap fabric.
B005PH26LE|5|This was the perfect gift for my dad, who is restoring a Triumph Bonneville.
B00KMOSROU|5|Perfect
B00BF22KK0|4|Material and printing are good but the sizing runs too small.  i ordered an XL expecting it to be loose but it ran too small
B007F8RS64|5|it seems as though you cannot find panties any softer than Calvin Klein. These do not disappoint, great for everyday of the week! My wife loves them!
B00BHKZE7Q|5|Gave as a gift....they loved it and it fit perfectly
B009RBKF6M|3|I am happy though, it just that I thought it would have been a bit more snugged- but overall its great! Not as spandix as I thought
B00D7HH72C|5|fits fine. quality is good
B00U6ZYLQ8|5|I'm typically a Medium with a larger bust and it fits perfectly. The material is awesome and I get compliments on it all the time. Also came earlier than expected
B0090SWJBG|3|The product does what it is supposed to do, but it has one major flaw: the back of these panties do not cover my full bum, only half way, resulting in<br />&#34;leaking&#34; from the back.
B004Z30OKE|2|I received this product but it is not my size. I recommend check the details of size before buying, it was my mistake. but they are comfortable,
B009JUTNC8|4|My niece is a big fan of Monster High, and She was thrill with this shirt. It is very soft and the prints are very nice. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because of the size, my niece is 8 years old and she is skinny, I bought her size 10-12 thinking that she might be able to wear it for a while but it fits kind of tight, I hope it doesn't shrink. The product shipped on time.
B0051U182I|5|Very comfortable
B00HN3DJMS|4|Very sexy little dress that I purchased for my newly pregnant wife. It was a little shorter than expected, which was GREAT for me! ;)
B00L02V5YM|1|Rather cheaply made. Several lace snags when it arrived. Sleeves came over my wrists. The material in the back seems to be an after thought and does nothing for the dress.
B005Q0E0ZK|5|Got a lot of compliment every time i wear it
B00FQJBHS4|2|The snaps broke.  Was disappointed by the quality
B00DNK388U|4|Nice shirt, but fits a little tight and clingy. Nice thin, stretchy shirt with a nice design.would rate 5 stars if was slightly larger .
B00FA2SPVO|5|great price. product delivered as advertised!
B001UT35H0|2|I didn't feel or notice a difference when wearing the Fit Shaper. I think that once you hit a certain size you just have to deal with it. Or invest into something a tad more expensive. i was looking for good support at a cheap price. And a cheap support system is what i got.
B00MM3OVQM|5|Cute!
B00FVYHDUU|5|I received SOOOO many compliments on my top that it was remarkable! I simply love it and wish that I could get it several other color combos. I am getting the Tangerine-pink combo next!
B0080J0TP4|5|I bought this coat for my great grand daughter, her mom loved it and so does she.... It is well made and the price was fantastic!!
B001PUJCUI|5|Very nice quality.
B00IO9JCY4|5|In the early going, these seem like my best tube-sock purchase in a while.
B005LT7R1K|4|I'm pretty tall for a girl so the skirt rode a little high for my liking. But, it's a great beach/summer dress!
B00NILCA6K|3|I ordered a large since I usually wear a medium. They sent an XL, but even thoug it's a little big, it fits well over thick sweaters and bulky sweatshirts. The quality is good and it's nice and warm, but 3 stars for sending the wrong size. I would recommend that you go up 2 sizes from what you usually wear if you plan to layer underneath.
B00PHVU39K|5|Loved it...wore it to preschool.
B0009MZVVW|5|My husband loves these socks and will not wear anything else.  I have tried buying cheaper imitations, but it is a waste of money.  The Throlo's wear well and as long as you always buy the same color, discarding one sock due to holes is not an issue.  Husband wears these daily and goes through about six pairs a year.  He loves the cushioning and that his feet don't sweat with these socks.
B00EASWUU6|4|I GOT IT IN MY SIZE ... BUT IT STILL WAS A LITTLE SMALL ... I NEEDED HELP PUTTING IT ON AND TAKING IT OFF... BUT THE LOOK WAS FABULOUS... I GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS FROM OTHER WOMEN.... EVERYONE WANTED TO KNOW WHERE I GOT IT FROM. WOULD LIKE TO GET IN ANOTHER COLOR.
B00C5WNB70|5|I bought this jean and shipped to Thailand because it looks very nice design and good deal. It is over my expectation both design, color and great fit. Its size is as said. Very comfortable. Highly recommend this model!
B002GYMSLW|5|awesome product. They eyes gave me difficult seeing out of but it is a good one size fit all mask. Might be a little tight at first and smell a little strange but that is because the product is new. I would buy again.
B00ITY05KY|5|My 2 years old daughter fell in love with this backpack.
B0018OPLTW|5|good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident
B00QYTY174|1|item arrived damaged with design flaws and ripped seams
B00D1CJBRC|5|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it! The fit was great and the design was an original one that I wasn't able to find anywhere else.<br /><br />I would buy from this seller again!
B008QUNX8C|4|Received next day as promised, beautiful,absolutely beautiful. One problem,fabric doesn't give;while it fit perfectly....I was sadly aware that my tummy was quite large.In addition, I wear a Barely B,this is not made for the &#34;A&#34; cup woman. 5ft3,135lbs, it also just skins the floor. It still looked awesome,ordered a small....but I am positive a medium would have been a little too big
B00XKSI5AG|5|I got these in size 4 for a two year old, knowing I was going one size up.  I hate when clothes are outgrown practically home from the store.  These are very well made of thick fabric.  Size appears to be as described (there is a size chart next to the drop down menu).  Because these are made just like adult jeans and are not stretchy and don't have any elastic, I recommend trying them on and buying in a store or getting them slightly larger.  But, here is the super cool thing:  there is a red elastic band inside the waist of the jean, so you can pull it and hook it over buttons to make the waist a litte smaller.  Another reason to buy large, bring the waist in, then let it out.  You can maybe get an inch and a half of play this way, which is almost a full size in these. They don't quite shrink (come preshrunk), but all jeans are a little smaller after a wash, then stretch out.  Pretty much these are an old school wrangler jean in a small child size.  These will hold up to rough play.  They are durable and good looking and make for a cute snappy wardrobe basic.
B00822DC5S|1|How long is the skirt?
B00BQLBNG2|2|Not a bad quality, but definitely nothing like he picture advertised. The fuzzy part doesn't extend through the sleeves and it is also very thin. The picture makes it out a be a very thick looking coat for cold winter days, but it is actually very hin. The zipper is also hard to move up and down. Not a bad jacket for a cool evening, but definitely NOT for the winter.
B00JE31RSS|3|This is well made and I will reorder, however; their chart  did not match my measurements and was way tooo large. I will re-order going down two sizes...I will update post if this works.
B00DV8SIPM|3|The four shrugs I purchased are pretty, and I very much like the style, but I can't wear them because they are extremely snug. My size is most often small, but because I wasn't sure how these sweaters would fit, I ordered medium, and even that is too small.
B00CJRV718|4|This dress fits a little small. It made ok. It is an interesting pattern. I usually wear and 8 or 10 and the 10 was slightly tight.
B00CAFP4YA|4|I have multiple pairs of AG jeans and all are a size 26 but I returned these for a 27 which fit great. I am 5 feet and 7 inches and weight 115 pounds.
B005964XYY|5|Loved it.
B00VWCTPZ6|4|Love it! Specially for my first white outfit. I'm five feet 100 pounds so usually small/xsmall. Got a small and it fits very nicely. Looks snug but it's not constricting. My only complaint is it's pretty see though so make sure you got a white or beige bra and panties to go with it and you're good to go.
B00N4IDHTQ|5|I am amazed!  I just got this shirt in today and it fits so perfectly, like a size medium in US.  Material is awesome and the graphics are great as well.  I am totally looking into purchasing more of these!
B004NP9MPC|5|Great fit,  great price!
B00IEBI9Z0|5|Great bralettes!
B00JSNAJYW|5|The true craftsmanship and quality of these shirts is unsurpassed.  In addition the shirt can be worn as business casual or with a nice pair of shorts to complete a fashionable summer look.
B00IYFEDH4|5|On time delivery it fits well thank you
B00CKGBCBS|5|A very useful piece of wardrobe for a good price.
B00JQWLMEQ|5|I loved this dress. I recommend it.
B0097FJWB2|2|Although the shirt appeared to be what I wanted, it's very light weight and extremely tight for a 2 XL. On top of all that, it's 100% cotton so it will shrink once it's washed. I have learned that I need a little more money to get it more superior product. I guess it was worth the price, between $10 and $13. Now I see why the more expensive ones, St. John's Bay or Eddie Bauer are a better product for the money.
B00UA9ZGPK|5|Super cute dress, just a little short, but the width fits great!
B00AWB3GRG|2|I'm a 36 C.  I bought this bra in my never-ending quest to find a non-underwire bra with adequate support for my aging bust.  I thought somehow that the expanded back of this bra would do it.  Nope.
B00MRANWOW|5|Bought this for my 16 year old son because he wouldn't stop stealing mine.  He wears it every day.  Looks like Hugh Hefner lounging around the mansion.  Good quality terry cloth, warm and comfortable.
B00HNJQ2ZI|5|i like it
B0053BVXW0|2|Very cheap apron on polyester!  The graphic is cool, but not very durable for almost $20. I thought the Swiss cheese was an oven mitt, it would have been nice. if it was printed on a durable cotton twill like most aprons, I would have given 5 stars.
B00P1JE3QM|2|A little big
B00HHTD4EQ|5|Fits my daughter perfectly! She's 32 inches tall and 25 lbs. I put this on her while at the beach. The material is great for the nice breeze.
B00BT8VWI6|3|The metal decals on the back pockets are not glued on too well.  All but 3 have fallen off with just one washing.  The jeans were also slightly smaller than expected.  I order the same size Lee jeans all the time and have had great luck with the fit,  However, I would recommend ordering a size larger for this particular style
B003GXFTU4|5|Love this wallet.<br /><br />I had my last wallet for over 10 years until it literally fell apart. I was looking for the next wallet to last me another 10 years and I think this will be it for sure.<br /><br />I was not expecting the zippered money pouch, but I can live with that. Otherwise, I am very pleased. I have been using it for about a week now.<br /><br />The packaging was pretty neat too, came in a blue tin that is so nice I am keeping it. Don't know what for, but it looks too cool to throw out!
B00AYV01J0|4|Nice simple tee shirt.  I wear it as a layering piece under other shirts for warmth.
B00Z7W85VW|5|Soft and confortable, good to match T-shirt etc. Qualified !
B0018OMJWE|5|Great jeans for a middle-aged guy.  I've bought about 10 pair over the years--they're the only jeans I wear.  Really comfortable, but not too baggy.
B0007YR9J4|4|The whole point of this bra is to have a comfortable strap.  They make the straps wide to minimize having them dig into your shoulders (sadly this limits shirts you can safely wear over this bra), but then they added lacy edges.  Straps normally only bother me a little bit, but the scratchiness of the lace on this one is REALLY irritating for me personally.  It's a very small bit of lace that I couldn't even see in the picture. I really wish they hadn't tried to pretty up the bra with the lace trim. Hate it.<br /><br />I actually prefer regular bras with the underwire, but the price was right on this and I've had friends tell me going without the wire can be very comfortable.  I was nicely surprised at the lift this bra provides me, which is why I am giving it 4 starts instead of just 3.  However, I feel like the fabric scrunches under the bust after wearing it all day long. Definitely never had that issue with wire bras.
B004PA72GG|5|Very soft, fits true to size, great everyday tee.
B00700EU7M|5|exelente producto
B00H05KRXI|5|Good
B009HYUDPC|5|Great around the house sweater. Looks to run a little large but that is what the wife loves about it.
B009QUNH4G|5|Great fit, soft fabric!  I am 5'9&#34; and weigh approximately 155.  I purchased the size medium. This is the second Munki Munki purchase I've made.  I also have a flannel nightgown.  I love it too but it is just slightly snug on me.
B008EPWAH4|5|I bought this coat for my granddaughter and she loves it.  Fit perfectly and coat was of good quality.  Price was very reasonable.
B00EZTR1VI|5|Bought this for my wife.  She loves it, and the sizes are accurate.  Well built and she said its very warm.
B00LBHK4PM|5|I love this sweater -- have in Antique Rose, which is a great neutral. If I could get it in more colors I would. Warm, comfortable, durable, and extremely flattering. Starting to get chilly which means I can start wearing it again! Lilla P - please bring this back, I can't find it anywhere (in my size)!
B00L5ZA4U0|5|Very soft!!
B00J09JWBU|3|The shirt arrived promptly and is a very good quality, but it is too short.  He is 5' 10&#34; and it barely hits below his belt.  He liked the shirt a lot so we didn't return it, but he will need to wear it with a long t-shirt underneath.  One positive also is that he has an extreme athletic build (Broad shoulders and small waist) and there was not the usual bagginess in the waist that he sometimes gets when buying a shirt that fits his shoulders and arms.  It would have been perfect if it were a couple inches longer.
B00C5SW3AA|5|Good quality.
B00KTMEV4U|5|Good socks
B00817DZQA|4|Bbbbn
B0016L2DN4|5|Cheap and very cute
B002QUSLZI|5|I have ordered 5 dresses from MauiShirts. These Hawaiian dresses are very well made. I was very happy to find them on Amazon as there is no source locally and I have been searching for quite some time. The dresses were packaged extremely well, with virtually NO wrinkles when they arrived. In a review I read before ordering, it advised ordering at least 2 sizes larger than you normally wear. I did order 2 sizes larger and they fit perfectly.
B00FRD77DS|1|Style was great except hey were crooked on my face and I couldn't straighten them out - looked terrible - I ended up wearing a pair of old sunglasses...
B00MH4G1IM|1|Was not happy at all with the quality of this sock. Right out of the package the threads were worn and fraying. Needed them for my sons birthday as a gift so no time to return. Very disappointed.
B003R3QAQK|5|Need to buy the devil hands as well, I didn't mean to make a lot of kids scared but I did also they cried there eyes out too
B0046BRL24|5|I wanted to buy my girlfriend a good robe for christmas not some junk like you find at walmart or k mart so after looking  around I found this robe on amazon and took a risk not knowing what I was doing and ordered this robe for her and I couldn't have done any better it is comfortable pretty and warm a very nice robe and she is more than happywith it.jacl w.
B00MHDVTYE|5|Beautiful shirt!
B00KS70M0I|4|I've purchased Jag jeans; they were twice the price and these are just as nice.  I'm 5'4&#34; and weigh 125.  In Jags, I take a 4 and they are generally too long.  In Lee's I take a 6 and the length is just right!  Just saying... ;)
B007RFOOVM|3|These socks feel pretty cheap, which is obviously why they are so inexpensive.  After first wear, they feel the same as my old pairs.
B00JK9OZMQ|4|I purchased this for my wife. She said it was a bit small but I still thought it looked sexy on her and I look forward to the next time she wears it.
B001FXLSXE|4|I have been though probably 20 wigs in last. 2 years for the PRICE. this is a BEAUTIFUL wig even more pretty than it shows its the same color I've been wearing for 2 years now but it's cured ,,, you cannot use a straighten on it like my $50.00 wigs but I do have to say it losses hairs easily but a great wig to trough on when going somewhere nice but donot recommend for everyday use it will not last other than that I do give it a thums up for the price that's for sure
B008H1YC1M|2|The shine is just not there, the reason I bought it is to get the shine like it's portrayed on the picture and it's just not on these leggings, so disappointing.
B008DSL1KE|5|nice. I love it
B004R8WKLI|5|THIS IS A WONDERFUL FASHION RING, FUN AND POPULAR. EVERY TIME I WHERE THIS RING I ALWAYS GET COMPLIMENTS FROM PEOPLE. I JUST LOVE IT!
B008RNLZA6|4|cute shirt for the price.<br />it is very soft.<br />came on time<br />fits well, and doesnt seem to shrink in wash
B00LIF57HC|5|Love this hat. I wear it everyday.
B001LNUQ72|4|When I first received this shirt I thought it was huge. I normally wear a medium to a large in t-shirts but went with the runs small reviews and bought the XL. I am glad I did because after I washed it it definitely shrunk a size, now it fits good. The color was a little off from the picture but still a nice pink. It is light weight and will be great for summer. Hope it does not shrink anymore.
B00D3PM1H4|5|These are comfy, sturdy, and go with everything.  I bought the same pants in the next size up.  They go with everything and are easy to put on and take off.
B0087CK57G|1|I order the 34&#34;x34&#34; all the time and these were way too tight! The pant legs were skinny, the thighs and butt area were way too tight. Getting my hands in the front pockets is impossible. Also the fabric is very thin, much thinner than a standard pair of jeans. I look like a skinny pant wearing hipster at age 33. They are in the trash.
B0088B4V0S|5|I love love love this outfit!  Makes my grandson look even more handsome than he is!  Nice strong jeans, dark in color and heavy duty not those flimsy kind found in discount stores.  The button up shirt is very cute, fits true to size.  The sweater simply makes the outfit, very sharp looking.  You cannot go wrong with this outfit!
B00KDD41IQ|4|I would buy this again because it is great.<br />Feels and looks of good quality.<br />But it is not a small more like an extra small.
B003BQ05IM|5|This is an awesome big brim visor. I used it on my vacation in Aruba and it was perfect.  I will also use it during golf!  Good quality, not cheap or flimsy.
B00N4UDDPW|4|I thought it was a very nice sweater. Nice quality and texture. Thick, stylish and definitely  will keep you warm. The problem the person I bought it for (girlfriend) didn't like it. I guess just a matter of different taste.  But  still a great sweater.
B008WZ6KZ4|3|It was well made but unfortunately it was short and wide. It made my torso look short and wide. It was just ok.
B00OV7YSPQ|5|Good looking shorts and the material is cool. Quality at value price.
B00DQYWGCC|4|I bought this jacket as an inexpensive everyday wear type of thing for the Northwest Oregon winters. So far it has done exactly as i hoped it would, and kept rain out in some pretty wet conditions. I am a forestry major, and spend hours at a time out in the woods getting poured on. i was dry. from first impressions the material seems like the type of material will hold over time. the two things i would have to complain about on this jacket are the draw cords for the hood kind of just come out and end, sometimes sticking awkwardly out, but they can be more or less tucked in, and the inner netting just isnt as comfortable as some other jacket interiors that i have owned, but hey, its better than just the waterproof meterial on your skin. all in all, i like the jacket, and its really pretty good for the price
B00DPB9YQM|5|THEYRE COMFORTABLE AND ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL PANTS. IM 5'1 AND IT GOES PROBABLY 5 OR 6 INCHES ABOVE MY ANKLE !
B00EE16R4Y|4|Overall, I like this sweater a lot! It's good material and tacky but cute at the same time. It's not really the baggy sweater look that I thought I wanted but the fit is still flattering - especially since it's black.
B008H2ETBE|3|I would not say that these are the greatest socks, they are okay.  They did not hold up for more than a year and a half.  The padding was not really very thick.
B00JL53ZOS|5|The shirt is very nice but a little small. I should have ordered a larger size
B00JGWQU2K|5|Wore it to church this am and got complemented!  Wonderful!
B000ADTPN0|5|The hat arrived days before the expected date and came in excellent condition!
B00WE3J7SC|3|Smaller than expected.
B008HZ6R5M|5|Fit wonderful and very comfortable.  No seams that hurt or leave marks, straps stay up and does lift.  Will and have order more Glamorise bras with no problems.
B004X67H6W|5|Delivery was timely, and the product is top-notch quality -- well worth the price!  Would love to have the matching Jacket worn on the NCIS DC program.
B00715SPZE|5|Very good quality and fit.  The fabric is thin and cool just what I wanted to wear on warm weather days.  Cotton is always the best.
B00GB7ZPXS|5|Bought the purple v-neck tunic for a family show where we need pockets to keep plastic gold in. The colour is lovely and quality excellent. It is a little more broad on the shoulders than usual for the size you select.  What is tricky is telling the exact colour from the website listing but you can always return if it's the wrong colour and exchange which I did - I originally ordered grape but then when got it it was far too pinky for my colour scheme which I hadn't picked up from the online picture, perhaps a close up of just the material could also be included?
B00LGWWQPS|4|My daughter love it, also it fits perfectly thanks.
B00MHFID14|5|I measured  37.5 and bought a 40.. fit great .. wore it for the first week and on day 5 i could move it to the second row..
B000QWA2R8|5|Excelent product, the color is just a little darker than the picture but besides that it's just what I wanted it
B00I04WQB4|5|I bought this dress for my niece 3 years old and it is your size, she love it and me too because looks fine
B00A7FZ7OW|5|My son loved this hat!  It was a good quality buy.  Sturdy and as vibrant as the picture shows.  He was so excited to have it!
B00CX0JNH6|5|This jacket is beautiful.The brighter looking colour flowers is really not yellow it is really orange.Good quality and shape defined.I am happy with my purchase.
B00LI77F6G|2|arms are too short and the shirt does not fit normal size
B002ATSH7W|2|it was a little blue, not a grey. i was so angry. Its too long for a small skinny person. one wash and it was pretty much ruined. i wish i could have returned it.
B00J2T0F9G|5|Product arrived on time & in perfect condition.<br />Perfect for the size 14 with sone curves going on. The jeans have a little give for when you go overboard on the carbs & haven't been exercising.
B00GUMAR9Q|1|I think this will be the first thing I will need to return to Amazon, because it does not look or fit like it was described.  The dress is inexpensive, but I did not expect it to look so cheap.
B001THHE7K|2|I was attending a wedding and needed a black suit ASAP. I never order suits online and I took a chance on Amazon. Order was placed on Tuesday and shipment arrived on Thursday (prime customer).<br /><br />Jacket and pants (ordered separately) fitted to a perfection. Saved me a trip to the tailor for heigh adjustment.<br /><br />Although the color is black, it breathed rather nicely on a hot 90F day.<br /><br />I highly recommend this jacket.<br /><br />(Update May 2017)<br />I've lowered my rating from 5 to 2 stars due to a problem in the material, especially on the black set. Not matter how often you dry clean it, it's never cleaned from white hair like particles coming from the suit's inner fabric.<br />Quite embarrassing having people staring at your suit, and not for its good look.<br />I may not wear it again and only wore it 2-3 times.<br />As stated originally, the fit is quite nice but the fabric quality is not up to par
B003XRF0IE|5|These are by far the most comfortable thermals I've ever owned. They also survive numerous washing which makes them durable. The cotton is surprisingly soft. Even the labels and seems are made so they won't scratch you. I have very sensitive skin and I'm afraid to wear anything else. I own several pair and will order more.
B009I0VSOA|3|i didnt like it but it was for a friend of mine.and he like it alot.but have nothing more to say about this product.
B00JC01T5Y|5|very well！
B00960T7RM|3|MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS DRESS, SHE WORE IT TO SCHOOL, WHEN PICKED HER UP FROM SCHOOL ALL THE BUTTONS HAD COME OFF.  THANK GOD SHE HAD WORN SHORTS UNDER THE DRESS, ONLY THE TOP BUTTONE REMAINED.
B00OB0G63K|1|Was very disappointed in this outfit.  Very cute but very small!
B00JB8P7HI|5|Perfect size
B00DFBV6CC|3|They fit great but I wouldn't wear them out in public because they are too sheer. They're great for range of motion.
B00J7EU3JI|2|Cool hat, looks awesome, works for a dread hat, but stitches came loose the first day and there's a hole now. Good buy if you can sew.
B004YV8NI2|5|I wen this going up my face and everyone LOVED it! I had so many people come up to me and examine me like a science experiment it was awesome! Totally recommend
B00QCR4HOU|5|While the item description states that these are super thick socks, they are actually very thin.  However, these socks are super comfortable, I absolutely love them, and plan on buying more!!!
B0052UUUIK|3|Great wall piece! But way too damn heavy to wear as a mask, plus there is no ventilation, just eye slots. If a collector, this is a great addition and conversation piece.
B008LE9H74|5|This is by far my new favorite shirt! it fits me perfectly and it makes my boobs look great !  it got to my house in 6 days rather than 3-5 like it said but who cares if it was one extra day??  if you thinnk this shirt is cool i recommend  you get this shirt asap!
B00OX556RA|4|The pictures clearly show that this is a &#34;see through&#34; sweater, so I expected it to be thin - and it is just as I wanted it. The sweater hugs the body nicely, but does not support, so any bulges and bumps will be visible, unless supported by some slimming undergarment. If your body is firm, it will look great. It is a really nice tunic to pair with pants, slacks, or skinny jeans.<br /><br />I say 'tunic' they say 'dress'. Well, my torso is average and this 'dress' hardly came long enough to cover the panties and not a quarter inch longer. Ladies with short torso and small hips might use it as a mini dress, I suppose, but it would be really mini. And for a dress, a slip is a must, or the color and outline of your panties will be clearly visible. Opaque tights should also work well, for a more restrained look.
B00DUS7EN0|5|Cut nicely on the full side. For sure a keeper.
B00MCK1O5Q|5|Adorable dress, even more beautiful in person.  And amazing value!
B006T54LN2|5|XL fits size 12 or snugly on a 14. This is very cute, soft cotton.  Perfect length and fit. Love the graphic design.
B00D6OOH7E|3|I love the shirt but it was just  a little tight  around the  belly the shirt is perfect for the summer.
B00F957P36|5|I love this tank. I use it everynight because it works perfect for feeding in the middle of the night. The only negative would be that it rolls up sometimes because of the material. I got a small since I am petite, but I wear 34d so it was a tight fit to get on the first few times. Now it stretched out and fits perfect.
B00MLYRUWY|4|Great hat
B00I5D70AW|5|Comfy
B001OCQY6W|5|Good support that can be hard to find in bigger sizes. Vented and very comfortabe. Price is a great deal.
B00EIFGHI2|5|Exactly what I was looking for. Similar belts at local Big and Tall type places want over half as much for belts like these and this one is as good if not better. I will order again.
B006P2U8JA|2|From the photo, I thought the sleeves were longer.  I am 5'9\\".  On me, the sleeves are 3/4 length.  It looks easy to return.  There was a return slip in the package.  Returns are $7.50 by FedEx or USPS.<br /><br />The fabric was okay.  It felt okay against my skin.  Not super soft, but comfortable (and I am picky about how fabric feels).<br /><br />I did not like the combo of short sleeves with the front hanging down to my knees.  (It really does hang down to my knees, even at 5'9\\".)<br /><br />I liked their catalog and may order other clothes from them.
B0027VT5XI|2|I'm a big guy (6' 200 lbs) and this fits... bad.  The pants length is too short but the top is HUGE - looks like you're swimming in a black and red tarp.  The hat and mask are of OK quality (not a full mask - just a 1/2 mask with elastic strap).<br /><br />Overall - not really thrilled with the purchase.  I would've went another route.
B00L0XYN5E|4|First pair I ordered was a medium, and I felt that it was somewhat big so I ordered a small and got the same feeling. other wise the pants stay up nicely and feel amazing, if you are concerned with fabric and look, and the wife likes it.
B0034G65MO|2|I bought these same ones in the store and they fit much better than the ones I ordered here.  Not sure what the difference is.  They were true to size though.
B00A63YEPS|3|My son loved them, but the quality of the fabric can be better. After a few washes it started to look a little fade.
B002OEY79U|5|Excelent product
B00JL2NE56|3|Lovely
B00DUUE43Q|5|nice quality
B00MHLXE3U|2|Very bad jast like a t shirt
B00CMQXBLU|4|Soft t-shirt material, bright logo, fits well.
B00F93GLNS|5|These were gifts and my nieces were very HAPPY!
B00EMG3VMC|5|Great sleepers!!
B00PC14RSS|5|Cute hats.  Got 3 colors.  The black hat is somewhat smaller than the others, which I found baffling, but they fit and work as advertised.
B000I5HCVM|5|Very soft cotton, no tag on waistband, legs a little longer than other brands, shrinks back to size after washing.
B00O9MLUQI|5|adorable!!!
B00LIUTC8M|3|Way too small.  I ordered it a size larger, but it is still too small.  It does look nice though.
B0013E3PAY|5|Wow.  I love bamboo.  Not sure what magic they use to make these, but I love bamboo.  So soft, so comfortable, just flat out amazing.<br /><br />Check out the boxer also...<br />[[ASIN:B0013E5GZ6 Andrew Christian Bamboo Fiber Boxer]]
B00SMLZYXC|5|Great, casual dress. It has pockets too!
B008O8CCNI|5|I'm so happy with this robe. Great quality fantastic price. Department stores sell the same exact thing for $50+. I'll be buying more as gifts.
B008XBJ3E2|5|Timerland makes great products and this slim, sleek feeling little wallet is no different.  It's perfect!
B00PRTDAME|5|the material has a very comfortable feel to the skin. It has a stretch that enhances fit to the contours of your body. Under the arm pit  band is very protective of unwanted sweat residue . No change in color or quality after repeated  washing. I love it and will gladly recommend it to any male with a desire for elegance , quality and avoidable price.
B001JYIOZY|5|I really enjoy this fan, it's so pretty and alot classier then using that bar napkin, newspaper or magazine to fan yourself.
B00E8HDX5U|4|It's even cuter than I expected. My son loves it and looks adorable in it.
B00EZGLAX6|5|My daughter absolutely loves the pins and I am pleased with them as well, definitely will be a repeat customer!
B004OOYQRG|5|Love it! My new favorite top!
B0073Z37VO|5|Wallet is still going strong after months of use. Very roomy wallet and excellent leather quality.
B005E1KR2Q|5|Gave it to my daughter to use, she's started riding and had lost, (and found), her wallet once on the driveway, and she's in love with it. Her smile is worth a hundred more of these.
B00AZTQZEQ|4|True to size, fits nice, good fabric, it's a thumbs up. I went for the yellow. Because the other colors were not available in Large.
B00D7ECKT0|5|The reputation of the brand precedes it. This a great shirt, for a great price. We'll be using for a special occasion.
B00S7QR9QM|4|Nice!!!
B00H3EEL6A|4|its ok
B0067USYT6|5|great pants
B004V55OAG|3|I picked this belt up for the purpose of not having to take off my belt before boarding an airplane. Upon first glance, everything about this belt is awesome.  It is relatively lightweight yet incredibly strong with a rugged and sturdy feel to it.  The colors are great, and it looks like a premium quality nylon belt.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when you put the belt on you realize everything has gone horribly wrong.  Here are the two main flaws that may render the product nearly useless for some:<br /><br />1.  Size: much smaller than expected.  Yes, I should have read through the reviews to realize the sizing is misleading.  Order one or two sizes larger than your pants size.  Don't worry, you are not fat.  5.11 screwed it up.<br /><br />2.  The \\"buckle\\" protrudes an inch from your waist when connected.  It looks awkward and creates a much higher profile than most people want from their belt.  This is the price you pay for the stiff, double layered design.<br /><br />Some people may like this belt, but it does not merit all the \\"five star\\" reviews.  Did these people even take the time to try the belt on?  Obviously not, and they are diminishing my faith in Amazon's product ratings.  Lately you don't have to go far to find people saying things like \\"Great product, bought it as a gift\\", or \\"Five stars! My kid likes it!\\".  So I'm only lead to believe most of the reviewers are complete idiots who have never worn this belt.
B00ISI3VCA|3|Don't really write ratings but thought might as well since this one has mixed ratings.<br /><br />I ordered a large since I kept seeing that this product runs small.. and it does.<br />I'm normally a small-medium, and ordering a large actually fit alright!<br /><br />Before buying this product, you must be aware that since it is cheap, the fabric won't be the best but it's definitely do-able. Also, this shows the bikini displayed on a MODEL so keep that in mind (I sure did and wasn't disappointed once seeing it on me).<br /><br />MY BODY TYPE: I'm tall standing at 5'7ish, skinny but with almost no boobs... I'm a small B cup (36 B) and the top I received was a little bigger but still wearable. I would say the top would probably fit anyone up to a C cup (but you must be absolutely sure of your size! Some women don't know their true cup size!) but that's about it. Anything beyond that, good luck with it closing!<br />My butt. I actually have a butt. It's not huge but it's definitely more in my boob-to-butt ratio. I usually buy medium sized underwear from places and this large bottom, although it did fit, was tighter than I would have liked. It did not hurt or feel very uncomfortable, but was not super loose either. After asking my sister if she thought it looked too tight she did say it looked fine and couldn't tell.<br />The bottom line/waist thing looks nice if worn properly I must say, and so do the bikini bottom strap things.<br />The hook on the back of the bikini top I wasn't really a fan of. I clips and all, but it kinda makes me worried it will come undone at some point in time. So far, no accidents but I've only used it once and with little movement.<br /><br />So I do like this product, but it's not that great. I bought this after my Bodyglove bikini ripped after 2 years of overuse, so I was used to a big name and quality, but this product is not too bad. I would say if you really want it buy it... it does look cute!
B005LVDB40|4|A little small but a descent hat.
B00CYGZBMA|4|It is good enough with a reasonable price. But I think its neck will be easily stretched. So I expected I can wear this only in this summer season.
B00LP8YJ9E|5|Good for the price
B007PENV32|2|I LOVE this dress! Everything about it is great... however when I went to put it on the strap on one side broke and I will have to sew it back together already. I am really bummed but I bought a second one to see if the same thing happens.
B000WNRUBW|5|Wore this hat on my wedding day on Race Point Beach at the tip of Cape Cod.  Along with Khaki,s and a pastel Tommy Bahamma shirt the groom looked good.  The other groom looked darn good too!
B00H2JQBM8|5|Awesome!
B0048W920K|2|3 Months old and it is already falling apart.  I love the style but this thing is comming apart at the seams. The Right side pocket now flops around like a broken flip flop.  The leather was not the problem but the flimsy liner they are sewing it to.
B00019666W|5|just bought these shoes today for a wedding also, i was amazed by the price ($6.48!!) and comfort to. they go perfectly with my dress and I also have been just wearing them around the house! The heel didn't even bother me, even though I am quite tall!
B007YXJJYY|5|I have fibromyalgia.  Often clothing hurts to wear.  This bra helps so much when I need to go out and must wear one.  It is super stretchy and fabric is very soft to the skin.  It does not bind.
B003R7LD6I|5|Very warm. I wore them in the deep freeze of our Wisconsin winter and they are comfortable and warm. I am very glad I purchased them.
B00LXQ77RY|5|Love A.D. clothing. THese shirts are the most comfortable shirts to wear.  The colors are very nice.
B00DT4Y9RO|5|Again, I only wear NYDJ nowdays. I got hooked on them a couple of years ago and refuse to go back to anything else. The big bonus here was the price! I'm used to paying 3x  the price I payed for them here on Amazon. What a lovely surprise for me!
B005WUPQNY|4|Nice fit, hangs nicely. Overall the shirts are well made and fit per described. The only complaint, they were sort of shoved in the packaging. I know they are only t-shirts but still a little care would have been nice.
B00A3F9FYO|5|This Coca Cola T Shirt fits great and looks nice on me.  Love it!!
B00LHX7XV8|5|Love them unfortunately I need a size 29. These were a little too small. Please exchange for size 29. Thank you. The other pair is on their way.
B009SA80IW|4|Left my swimsuit in a hotel and needed one desperately one week before my cruise. Found this one and \\"click\\" bought it; Not easy to do when you are a big woman. It showed up very fast and Thank Goodness it fit great! The only thing I would have preferred was some padding in the bra...but it does have good underwire support. I also bought the skirt with built in bottoms and it too is wonderful. Pricey but worth it!
B00HA2OBAQ|5|The design on the top is so unique and cool.  The colors on the top flow well together and the top is comfy.  Comfy and pretty!
B001F9T2W2|5|I purchased almost all the suits from Pro Savings and they were all 100% brand new with all tags still attached. Nicely packaged and shipped in special made suit boxes. Suits came early than expected and they also provided the tracking # for the shipments. I get compliments every time I wear my suits and also referred my friends and family. The prices and the quality are the best. Please keep the good work and the quality so we can all benefit from. Thank you
B00IL2V9E0|5|I am a US XL, I was told by a lingerie store to order the size I wear.  This is not true.  If you are a US XL I suggest you order a XXL or XXXL.
B00ACIGP5E|5|very good
B00J7MBLH8|4|Dress is beautiful however it does not look like it does in the picture.  It is still very beautiful!
B009XB37IE|5|Luv it
B00B1C3DX2|4|the product met the expectations, the product is very very nice, the price is affordable and the quality of the product is good
B00S7SM2NA|1|I completely agree with the first review. I was so excited to get these adorable bows... Only to find out my daughter (3 months old) couldn't use them because the elastic left a mark after a short time. So bummed because I love the style. Waste of money.
B00ZC9DMDQ|1|Absolutely rude seller. Like other third party sellers on this website, sheinside provides a picture of a beautiful product but unlike other sellers, sheinside will give you a product that looks ABSOLUTELY nothing like the picture, and they will refuse to send a prepaid shipping label, which in turn leaves you unable to get a refund, unless you are willing to pay for a damn label to just return a horrible product and get your refund.. (which is absolutely ridiculous because they are basically making you pay, to get you money back.) STAY AWAY. I have linked my experience with them regarding another product.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UFBV4TU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00
B00QR4YDEW|4|Love the Jacket.. Just too small..sent back and waiting for the new size..
B00A4E7564|5|I bought this for my cruise and it's really cute!  I love the skirt. The color is great! I was afraid the gold/brass decorations on the top would discolor and turn my skin green, but so far hasn't happened. I've washed it numerous times and it's gone into the caribbean ocean 5 days straight.  Cute!  Not flimsy, like a lot of suits are. This was great for the price and I would recommend it to everyone!
B002PZYR1G|5|this is the only bra I wear.  great fit and nicely made. comfortable.
B00NLVO2T0|4|Got for husband. Very very long so he has to double it up to wear traditionally. He's not the type to wear like in the picture!
B004RL513E|5|This is the second time I've purchased these shirts for my husband. The shirts are very soft and comfortable. The fabric helps keep him cool in summer. I'm certain that we'll be buying them again when these wear out.
B004PKJ3XG|5|Nice belt
B00DVMZ43C|4|Excellent
B00FXLDMRY|4|After finally receiving this sweater after a few delivery snafus, my husband has this Christmas present, this handsome shawl collar cardigan.  The buckles for closure really give the sweater an unusual, classy look.  Would I purchase another?  YES, but I would make sure to order it weeks in advance of when it would be needed.
B00W83CXKW|1|These shorts came apart at the seams after one wearing. I appreciate they were inexpensive but, did not expect this poor level of quality. Junk!
B00DEAHOCK|5|I love it on my 2yr old. She uses it everyday going to play school. If they had bigger sizes I'd continue buying these.
B000SMKL72|5|You wont regret ordering this! I orderd it for my daughter anf fell in love with how adorable it is, great material, the crown is plastic but in all honesty it still looks good. Where else will you gind a princess Fiona head band like this?
B0097L4YMS|5|Producto de excelente calidad, telas finas y muy buenos acabados. Enviado a tiempo, siempre informado del estado del envío. cumple con lo anunciado.
B008KCK2DK|4|very pleased with jacket ..planin on orderin another one.thanks do much for ur service..
B005COY7VC|5|It was delivered really fast, and looks exactly like on the picture.
B00T12CDIU|5|Very nice suit. Fits very good and the service was excellent as usual. Thank you
B006PHXUOU|5|This is a agood case for the price.  It holds your credit cards and is suppose to help protect them from fraud.  I'm not thrilled about carrying my cards in a separate case than my billfold, but decided it was worth the added protection.  I got one for my husband too, but he felt it was a little bulky to put in his front pocket, while his wallet was in the back pocket!
B00TT3XGLO|5|The shirt arrived quickly to its destination. Looks great!
B008VPQR12|5|Nice but Not worth the price
B006MJIVDQ|5|Just what we expected
B00CIIK06Q|5|Great quality, price and styling. The fit is slightly large on a 5-1/2 yr old.
B003AXVUIA|5|My request was satisfied, thank you
B00GO0IH6O|5|Will purchase more shirts from Southpole! The shirt fit and arrived as advertised.    Since ordering this shirt, I've order more from Southpole - same size.
B00TUHF92I|3|Quality is ok. Cheaper fabric. Get what you pay for
B003QCJ5YQ|5|I've been looking for a few good pairs of lounging pants for the summer. Lightweight, a little baggy, with some stretch. These pants definitely fit the bill! I wouldn't recommend these for the winter, would not be warm at all.     Pants run bigger, so if you're not into flowing looser pants buy a size smaller. Also I'm 5'3'' and the pants are about two to three inches too long for me, but I haven't found the length getting in the way at all so I'll probably just leave them.
B00BMQNUI0|3|So these are super cute and fit everything but my calves. Granted I have larger calves but I think I will have to return them. I ordered my normal size in silvers and the waist actually fits good but they may get a bit baggy in the seat after wearing for awhile. I can't decide if the calves will stretch enough to make them comfortable.
B00MHOIRR0|3|This fits about a size large and is good quality, but its a looks like a fastfood restaurant uniform shirt.
B00C00Q430|5|Very cool looking shirt, thanx!  :)
B0039VWOLA|5|As soon as I put this on, I could see things no one else can see. Do things no one else can do. Amazing. Ordered a large, but feels somewhere between and large and a medium. Which is perfect for me, as I would have put it in the washer right away to get this fit. Just be mindful of it feeling a little smaller than most tank tops.<br /><br />Also this arrived in 2 days,despite saying it has a 4 day shipping.
B006U48LOM|5|EL VESTIDO ES MUCHO MAS HERMOSO DE LO QUE SE OBSERVA EN LA FOTOGRAF&Iacute;A, LA TALLA ES EXACTA, EL COLOR ES UN MARFIL INTENSO, LO RECOMIENDO 100%.. EL SITIO ES EXCELENTE, EL ENVIO LLEGO EN EL TIEMPO PREVISTO. LO RECOMIENDO!!
B007O13PU0|1|I need to return this product. Too small.
B006OP5M08|4|Bought two for my son 24 months. 100% cotton, but a little tough. Figure ahead properly clean immediately. Bought the blue and green, the colors are good.
B00KVMWVIG|5|Comfy robe
B00HZ6QI8U|5|Fits perfect. My daughter loves it.
B00BG5D9TW|5|The suit was just as expected, impeccable. I'd recommend it to any little dandy.<br />It was just the right size.
B00SK8CO7G|3|I only rate this product this low because the package I received was NOT three pairs of BLACK tights.  It was one black pair, one very dark brown, and one dark charcoal/grey pair.  They are very warm, comfortable, and not too tight in the waist or ankles, which are usually problem spots for me.  I'm 5'4&#34; and 115, though, so I can't promise these would accommodate someone as a true one-size item.  So far they seem to be holding up well in the wash and staying colorfast, I was just disappointed that the colors were different than advertised.  Usually I will return something on principle if there is a discrepancy like this, but I reasoned that it would be more versatile within my wardrobe to have the different colors.  Just be forewarned that these are NOT all black, even if they are good quality, soft, and warm.
B0080GSAF8|1|i really like it , but i think it is nor new the material seems it have been used and washed
B004BB6JG8|5|Early June i purchased a pair of these. I do not like \\"dork shorts\\" and like the square cut design of speedos but they are tighter than i like, these fit great! I like them so much i wanted to order more but the item was unavailable. i contacted the manufacturer and heard back whithin an hour!!! If there was something i would change it would be to add a tie string; if you are swimming laps and push off from the side of the pool to hard you may need to go back and pick up your suit. I have already placed my second order.
B00M2U63AW|3|These gloves are nice quality soft leather but, unfortunately they run way too small.  I always wear a medium glove, but I can barely get these mediums on. Thankfully, because they're leather, they've stretched a bit with wear so they are usable even though they're a bit hard to put on. I'd recommend buying them a size larger than you'd normally wear.
B007S016WQ|4|Easy to scratch
B00OM92OAE|5|Great shirt, great fit!
B00GH4K0VW|4|Perfect fit!
B0051D7GF8|5|These are great. Bought them for dress down day at work and they're very comfortable. Well-made and nice material (not too heavy nor too light) length is right and color is as shown.
B00CS5BWHU|5|exceeds expectations<br />very pretty<br />delicate<br />I purchased the item in several different colors and was pleased with all the selections
B00FBPLA12|4|The &#34;regular&#34; length was a tad too long and the &#34;petites&#34; feel a tad short. They still cover my socks and reach my shoes but I feel like I wear the pants a bit lower than intended to accomplish that. Still the brand makes comfortably light scrubs.
B00L62UWVI|5|Thicker than expected! Great quality
B002TAOVCC|5|At the end of last winter, some one decided they could use my ten-year old fedora more than I could. Boy! Did they ever do me a favor! What a great hat this is -- never got a bad product from Pendleton Mills. Will defend my hat from all comers.
B00AYCI73G|4|Nice and warm. It looks better on pictures than on a neck but I like it.
B00TP04M5A|5|The shirt is great! I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. It came faster than expected, too.
B002A9M480|4|The red yarn wig is fine. However, the wig will NOT to be worn as a Male Yarn wig...but by me and I am all female! It is to be worn with a Raggedy Ann costume and looks perfect. Rubie's Costume is selling this wig short by calling it a male yarn wig. The wig is excellent for anyone--man woman, boy or girl! The yarn is very nice and it is truly bright red---exactly like the picture. And for size---go for it. The wig has a stretch band to accommodate most sizes.
B001U23TYG|3|I would say this is a one-time use product.  Need a quick costume?  It should work for that.  But, it is not high quality by any means, and it will start falling apart if it's abused much at all.
B00HU24ZPM|2|One of the pairs had a hole
B004M6UD46|5|Not as premium fell as the hilfiger it is replacing but still a very nice smooth wallet. Awesome price !!
B00HD71YSU|5|Very cute and my granddaughter loved them.
B0014L16DO|5|What can I say, was a little skeptical buying suits from the Internet, not only was it excellent value, the suits were of high-quality material and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend purchasing from this company. Please keep up the good work and thank you for all your support and great suits!
B00A0PY5KG|5|Thank you for some very comfortable shorts that fit perfectly. I really appreciate the elastic which helps them fit better.
B00GNJ7HC6|3|Fits like a medium even tho it says large
B000NBGEI8|4|This hat is not worth more than one wearing.  It is much better to purchase the real thing than to waste money on this unless it is merely a practical prank.  We purchased it way before Christmas so it couldn't be returned in a timely manner.  Our daughter used glus sticks to affix fake jewels to it for fun!
B00C04N0FG|4|Very comfortable, and exactly what I was looking for.  If you are looking to upgrade your underwear, I'd recommend these.
B009BA4AMY|4|Its ok, the suede inside the mask could have been better, metal edges stab my nose. Scrached up mask when recived, i can see how uneven it is.<br />I still dig it.
B00H9V819K|5|Very warm and soft material! Great for days when the weather calls for something warm, but not heavy jacket warm.
B00DP5NRKM|5|My 6 year old LOVES these!
B00I2TFW5Y|4|It is ok.
B00T799632|5|Really cool shirt. I previously bought two for my husband & I in navy blue. Then I bought this one for my son to match. We own three Supras, so these shirts match us well. We got them very quickly and are good quality. Thank you.
B00A1MHN8E|1|The zipper brakes easily
B0077S4748|3|This is a good shirt, not a great one. The material is comfortable, as is the fit of the body of the shirt.. The problem for my husband is the collar. It does not fit snugly around his neck, but is big and, therefore, flops a little..
B00EVPFR80|5|good
B00CONNGVQ|5|Loved itt
B00X26I2TA|5|I love how it fits and hugs all the right places (my bust and stomach)!!!!!
B00BY6I61O|4|I love this belt including the detail. Although it is made kind of small I'd have to lose 3-5 pounds for the perfect I want.
B00D8VT2ZC|5|CLASSIC CARDIGAN. VERY NICE!
B00E4LCR3Y|5|A warm scarf
B00JF3MYN4|5|Impressive service!!!! Thank you.It arrived before the first day of the estimated delivery date.That's 2 days shipping from Europe to North America.Was a huge surprise when you think that sometimes it take a week in Canada for a parcel to be delivered from a place to another just 200 km away....<br />Was definitely worth to pay for the expedited shipping.Thank you.It fits very well( don't want to offend anyone:I am European,around 50kg//115 pounds and it's a true size S not like in North America where I am an XXS or XS :-)).<br />Love the fit and design. For whoever is interested in getting one  in North America, please consider ordering a size up(,ignore the tag size) from what are you used too as the European sizes run small compared with the North american ones.You will be pleasantly surprised with a good fit.Love Desigual!!!
B00LYHUMVA|2|I have several pair of legging from Hues, the corduroy fit the best, jeans fit well with some tailoring to the waist, the brown and grey pair of denim leggings I have  are a poor fit, even with tailoring. Can't figure out what the problem is, they don't have enough room in the rear, just don't look that good.
B00MRXJVR6|5|It was exactly how the picture shows I loved it
B001JSXKKO|4|Feels like real hair.  Nice and thick.
B002HJ377A|1|Comfort. Pure, unadulterated, relaxing comfort. That is what I look for in a shirt.<br />You see, I'm a real superhero by trade (when my mom isn't harping on me to, &#34;Search for a job.&#34; or &#34;Clean up your room.&#34; She is supercloseminded by trade!) and when I get home from a long day and night of pounding the pavement in search of those that need help or rescue, basically just working in unwanted tandem with the police department, I want to slug a couple of Mom's Bartles & James Coolers, slip into my comfy pair of maroon sweatpants, a nice RELAXING shirt and sit down for some good ol' fashioned D&D.I'm just like any other 38 year old guy who has had a long day of rewarding, helpful and investigative work.<br />Well, if you are a normal guy too then DO NOT BUY THIS SHIRT!<br />I was given this shirt as a gift by my mother, who knows how much I appreciate The Mountain apparel. Neither she nor I knew what was in store for me. The story goes: After a long day, I won't get into the details but suffice it to say, when police interfere with a professional crimestopper it gets exhausting. Anyway, after a long day I came home and promptly went to my headquarters in the basement before Mother could make me eat something for supper or clean the litter box. After I doffed my hero gear I got into the aforementioned sweatpants and put on my new TWM shirt. I won't bore you with any specifics but let's just say, I underwent some changes, permanent changes.<br />That night was not relaxing, nor has any night since been. I am drawn to the shirt I absolutely cannot take it off. Even during my quarterly shower I cannot take it off, but that isn't the problem. The problem is: THIS SHIRT MAKES YOU A SOCIAL BUTTERFLY! I can barely get in a Warhammer match because I am drawn to so many different places while wearing this shirt, much like the wolf is drawn to the pack. The Family Dollar, 7-11, Orion's Comic Books and Magic The Gathering Cards over on Hamilton, the public library, Master Ji's Dojo, Radio Shack, the list goes on and on! And while I'm out it seems as though every hot babe wants to get at me. They're always looking over at me and acting very coy. At first I thought it was my magnificent pelt of hair growing from my neck, but no, it's this damn shirt.<br />IF YOU WANT TO RELAX THIS ISN'T FOR YOU!
B008OX7BDE|1|This costume only came with hat,dress when i got dress it was flat at the bottom not poofy like on the picture the size i got is too small and the hair on the hat was smushed form the package the dress is just plain flat i didnt like this costume (i recomend not getting this costume)
B004SW9L7E|5|Great fit & look good, very comfortable!!!
B0058HBXVU|4|I love the size of this scarf. It's HUGE. Can easily be used as a wrap as shown in the pictures above or folded lengthwise and used as a scarf. The color is definitely burgundy, leaning toward a plum, IMO, and is nice. I was hoping for something a little more toward red, but didn't want to get the red scarf as I thought it would be too bright. So, the color isn't exactly what I was hoping for, but it is pretty.<br /><br />My only complaint with this scarf is that is it a bit scratchy and not really soft and cuddly like I was hoping. I have a 10-year-old wool scarf from Ann Taylor that I was trying to duplicate, but this one doesn't quite make it. The Ann Taylor scarf is so soft and lovely to have next to your skin. This scarf isn't itchy, but it also isn't very soft so I give it 4 stars.
B00579IHCM|4|Socks are warm and have good grip. I used them while I was in the hospital and they worked great
B001E510MM|2|This costume is not a good deal for the price paid. I ordered my correct size and when I put on the bottom for the first time, a piece of the gold decoration ripped off. I worry the rest of the gold decoration on both the bottom and top will fall off easily as well. This costume is a very cheap representation of the real thing and I do not recommend it for the price.
B003IH3H8E|5|I needed a wig for a retro pinup shoot and this one fit the bill.  Didn't need a lot of management right out of the bag and pulled off the retro pinup glamour look we were after.  The price was right too.
B005CSOGIC|5|Nice Quality!
B00JRHSUA4|3|fit was flattering, but material was thinner than i expected. given the price it just feels a little cheap. the &#34;v&#34; detail on the back is a little odd.
B005XRUOOW|5|He's into this skateboard BMX stuff and these type of shorts were near impossible to find in his size. The price on Amazon was much less than speciality stores and same NEW quality. The fit and construction is near perfect and he seems delighted with the little fox logo he can show off. Thanks....
B00RZXHDB4|3|Kind of crappy iron on letters??
B00J7MJB8E|5|He is the total hit at school for being totally turtled out.
B00GAS4WY6|4|legs are a little tighter than previous jeans same 517
B00AK3YWGU|5|Comfortable and soft swim shorts.  There is no webbing inside so I wear a speedo underneath, but it is very comfortable and the color looks really good.
B007SNJQWU|5|I think this is a quality product. It's very cute. I look forward to seeing it on my niece next winter.
B00RD5RQBG|5|This green color is just as springy and bright as it appears in the photo, think St. Patrick's Day green. I went up one size and got the 2x as I have broad shoulders, a large bust and long arms and there is plenty of room to wear a heavier sweater underneath and it sill does not pull on any buttons, nor is it so big that it looks sloppy. (The sleeves were a little short on me, but then again I have long arms and I have this problem with every coat I have ever had.) The fabric is slightly shiny and appears to be water resistant. The lining of the pockets is a nice soft material. Cinches at the waist just as I wanted it to and helps give me some shape. The coat and hood are lined with a blue/gray chambray material. The detailing is very high quality, and the buttons are all reinforced and sturdy.  There is a blue, red and white strip that goes down the center of the belt on one side and green on the other. The coat can button all the way up to the top and there is a hook that closes at the collar. And I have to mention that the belt is plenty long enough.  I have worn the coat and received many complements.  Very happy with this purchase.
B00GTCQ3YK|4|Vibrant color. Fits well. True to size.
B00BSDH2Z4|5|My daughter Loves this kind of hats & Loves monster high, this is 1 of her kindergarten graduation gifts she gonna Love it. Very happy with this, very cute.
B00F91B7U2|5|My son loved the pijama set. It has a snug fit and the pattern is lovely but not boring. Recommend 100%
B000IGCAEU|3|The material used to make the costume is thin, you can see right through it.
B005S1GH4Y|5|My daughter is studying nursing and she loves these Cherokee pants.  the fit wonderfully and easy to wash and wear.  They have lots of colors also/  Seller is wonderful;..  love the way they send the merchandise.  will order again from them when we need more pants/
B00AL6AQIY|5|I recently purchased this jacket for my daughter and myself. When it arrived, it was neatly packed and looked fabulous. The leather was high quality and we can wear it as a blazer or &#34;fall&#34; jacket. It is not reinforced by a thick lining, but I did not want one. This is the perfect Christmas gift :)
B00JN58IF2|5|Packaged well, received on time, good quality, satisfied!
B00828Q2KY|5|I've had this backpack for quite a while now and still use it everyday. The only thing that has slightly worn is hole in the leather the latch goes through. Great pockets inside for laptops (easily fits my MacBook Pro or Air) and the rest of your stuff. I now tight a simple knot in the drawstrings to keep the bag from sliding open when I know I'll be carrying it very far.
B004W1CVHS|5|Nice pants, just good as I expect!
B004QMLR00|5|This was perfect for my Thor costume!
B00DMF0TBK|1|The elastic is almost none existent and they fall off. I should have sent these back but never got around to it.
B00F93E2NY|5|It was a gift, he loves it too much! thanks for such an option. Very good look and beautiful color (eggplant marl), so comfort, soft,it is excellent!
B0083RKCFA|4|Comfortable fit, but a little loose; have to adjust the pants every now and then when wearing them.  Good room to grow into them.
B003PX3C4A|4|Good trunks for the price.
B001HB5YQG|5|very small nice glove
B00I8Q792K|5|I was looking for a stretchy jean jacket for two years now. This jacket is perfect. I am a size 10-12 and got the large. I was worried that it would be tight, but it fits like a glove! Also, I was worried about the length and worried it would be too short.It comes down to the top of my pants. I would have liked it a tad longer...but its not cropped (I did not want it cropped at the waist) I can wear it with dress pants, summer dresses, or even sweats! I highly recommend!
B006L86QDK|4|It's a great jacket.
B00C0PAFZ8|4|very good quality, but slow shipping, overall product is very good, this is really cute it doesn't stretch as much but it is still nice.
B00CJGETGO|3|Purchased this skirt but it was not true to fit
B000O7L7WY|4|This belt was inexpensive yet the leather is good quality and buckle is elegant.  My boyfriend wore one of these for 6 years until he finally wore it out.  So, I was happy when I found the exact replacement.  The belt is fully reversible with black on one side and a light chocolate brown on the other.  It reverses easily and matches many outfits.  It can also be repaired easily.<br /><br />I would have given it five stars, but it came with the buckle mounted at a skewed angle.  However, it was simple to fix with a small flathead screwdriver.  Unscrew the screws that hold the belt to the buckle (don't unscrew completely), realign and push the belt in, screw the screws back down.
B000W47XAY|5|The cutting and material both are great. Both the waistline and length are true to size, as indicated on the chart. I weight 120lbs and about 5'5. the Small size one fits great in terms of my height and the lower end sits at the middle of my calves, as shown in the picture. The fitting along thighs is great, a little room but still compliment my body shape well. I got a black one about two weeks ago and have been wearing it a lot. It stays in the shape and color after washes so far. Very glad about this purchase with is economically and functionally efficient. Will definitely look into more Soffe products.
B00BOVCV2O|5|I were size 8. Ilove everything about the sock they feel great comfortable to walk around then they're warm and I love them with all my heart
B00K64S3G8|5|I got a medium I'm usually small in bathing suit it fit perfect no way a small was going to fit me it's so bright nd colorful I love it
B001LB7Z5U|5|I bought the gray/navy one, it fits just fine, also it looks very good, I wanted to wear it when I go to the gym at cold days, but I now wear it all times.
B00KBJB3X8|2|I wear a 2X but ordered a 3X to get arm lenght, this shirt was no where close. It was not even a 2X. It's obviously imported from a country that has smaller sizes. It reflects on Amazon though. I'll give to someone as a gift.
B00B7O8OWO|5|These jeans came on the date specified in the shipping notice.  These were for my daughter and she was frantic to find a pair of white jeans at this time of the year.  Unfortunately, we tried several outlets and they didn't have any or her size.  Finally we decided to go to Amazon and we weren't disappointed.  We found the jeans and the right size.  It fits perfectly, only slightly long, but still great and my daughter is very happy.  This makes me happy and I would buy from this seller again.
B00E1LAOPU|3|Too small to be xl size.<br />It looks like a Medium
B00B1WO4NK|4|My first bolo tie. This is a nice piece - i wear it as i write. It's about the right size for me. The skull is a bit flatter than i thought it would be, but that's OK. The leather end caps are completely different from those shown - the ones i got are actually nicer, a bit more ornate. Looking forward to wearing it to my next Texas Hold'em game!
B00O2IQHAS|4|Perfect match to my dress
B00EGSF6QA|5|My granddaughter loved the dress.  She showed me it when we skyped it looked great.  I would recommend.
B0029UJS9S|2|Pipes came with scratches on the wooden part. Product disassembles easily on its own when you have it in mouth. Would be appreciated if there were some instructions on how to use the bubble features of this pipe because I was unable to figure it out. The description says that you can blow bubbles out of it so I was not pleased.
B005FXADCC|5|They are just what I have been wanting. They are very comfortable.
B001EJF9SO|5|Well made patch
B00K6BX384|3|Fabric feels good
B001D0AEK2|5|Husband looks great in them
B005L8YVGU|5|this espetacular wallet, Guess has very good product, I hope to buy more accessories. I'm very happy with the quality of this leather wallet.
B00JXU0F12|5|I love it!
B004UUDX8M|2|Bought this for a 63 inch tall girl, and it was too long.  Came to the ankles.<br /><br />The fabric is a thin polyester.  Not the fleece of other robes.  The crest looks a bit cheesy, but in my estimation none of the crests look very good (even on the fleece costumes).<br /><br />Ordered this because of the lack of choices.  The other fleece robes were for younger children and were too short.  This one is way too long.  Unfortunately, I have not found a good in-between length.<br /><br />Ordered a Ravenclaw scarf to go with this robe.  The scarf was a bit too narrow.  Now we have a funny looking costume with bad proportions...sigh.
B00EYDNSHG|5|Love it. Wore it to a networking event. Compliments all night.
B00590HIJ2|5|These are the only thongs I will wear.  They stay in place, don't bunch up, and are just super comfortable all around.  Worth the price.
B00BEW6TIK|5|Great!
B001054PA0|5|Purchased as a gift, and she enjoys wearing them. Are one of her favorite pairs of socks.<br /><br />I would recommenced then to others, as a gift.
B008ROT0R0|5|Adorable and very warm. Perfect for playing in the snow and looking like a dork XD I love it
B00MFY72V4|5|he loved it
