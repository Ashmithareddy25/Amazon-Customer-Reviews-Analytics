B009DK1NCM|5|It's the exact fit thanks
B00RM327NG|3|Its good.
B005NYDR5I|5|Exactly what I needed...delivered in a timely manner.
B00FYX2OJS|5|I purchased the Rome PU leather seat covers for my pt cruiser and I am very satisfied. Installation was easy, and they fit good. The texture was good and they look awesome.
B006WAMMDK|3|The seat covers arrived on time as promised, and they fit pretty good,im pleased with them.
B0080DHG3I|1|I was told by my mechanic that this was the wrong part for my Infinity G35 coupe crank shaft sensor ..
B0011N1TDC|5|functions as advertised
B007L2JNT4|5|Like it was custom made<br />Don't know how I safety pulled our camper without them
B007RVQYR8|4|For the price this is as good gets, beats paying twice as much as oem from dealer.
B001KRYICI|5|ok
B008XNZZ7O|5|Great product
B00NT5HK92|5|Best gear oil on the market. Expensive, but well worth the cost.
B0024E6Z9U|5|can't figure out why trailer didn't come with these, they work great, altho the rubber spacer needed to be trimmed for mine
B00LUPOU1O|5|Tools a must if removing any type of car interior parts. The large set with multiple tools gives you many different options for any application needed.
B00WMTLBXM|3|Videos makes this look like it is not that difficult to apply but I have found out it is better to leave to the professionals. I wasted a lot of it trying to apply to the front of my F150 and had to give up on it. The pro series does appear to be very durable and stronger than their older material. I was able to do a very simple section on my wife's jeep but even that was much harder than I felt is should have been to apply.
B000CFAV7K|5|These work very good for my husbands truck.
B0002Z9R16|5|Like it
B004306VTC|3|brown side is more of a darker grey but still looks good
B00D77MH6S|5|great product
B00BCRMA9Y|5|Good job
B00KMYYQ36|5|This sealer effectively restored the waterproofing ability of the top on my 11 year old Saab. It is easy to apply, dries quickly and performs extremely well even in the heavy downpours we have had recently.
B00852SAG6|5|Great product!
B000P7RV1O|3|Not bad for the money.
B003O6UDYK|5|Super easy to use. Makes installing seals super easy
B00KYWO3MK|5|I received my plasti dipped watched a lot of instructional videos from dyc and proceeded to dip my wheels and i must say it was very easy to do and they look great have my wheels two coats of matte black three coats of anthracite grey true metallic and a coat of glossifier and they came out pretty good for my first time
B0009IQZH0|5|Great towels for detailing your car. Can't go wrong with these babies.
B006WQSXSW|5|Fits great 1 month problem free. Clears up the traction control problem.
B008E7GBK4|5|This was a perfect fit on my 13 year old Acura and it really spiffed up the appearance.  The original headlights were very hazy and after two different attempts at restoration I threw in the towel and replaced them with these.  Car looks like new and the cost was very reasonable compared to genuine Acura OEM assemblies.
B000CPCRS6|5|Stupidly happy with this. I used a 1500 grit wet sand to help with adherence, and taped off the parts I didn't want to smoke out. I can not stress enough, LIGHT EVEN COATS!! Quick passes, don't hold down the trigger the whole time. Take your time with this. I put 3 coats on the side tail lights, and 2 coats on the back end. Finished it up with a 2000 grit wet sand and a buff for a glossy look. It looks so freaking good!
B00FYX2FQK|5|Husband loved them!!
B00GUAGIWS|4|Overall I really like the lights.  They have added &#34;pizazz&#34; to my 2012 Accent.  They look much better than the black factory plastic inserts and fit just right.  They arrived very well packaged in a little over two weeks.  There are no installation instructions, but a mechanic with electrical experience was able to install in approx. two hours.  They light as soon as you turn on the ignition and stay on until you turn off the engine.<br />The only negative I have with them is that they are not as bright as they should be for daylight use.  The LED's need to be brighter and/or they need to also have the remaining top row light up.  They do look cool at night.
B00LSTGO2K|5|Looks good and a perfect fit
B00LLLIXJ2|5|worked
B00JS3I96W|5|Better than car or boat wax by far.  Excellent for boat decks.  Robert Scarmazzo
B000BTCWS8|2|It stuck to the paper. Very hard to apply
B007IPSXFO|5|Good Value for the money
B00PJ05MWW|5|Look very good
B001NZQIFM|5|Tekonsha provided the spec for the cable needed to use with the Tundra.<br />Excellent, responsive service
B00C9V4EHI|4|good.. shipping to long
B00PJD6WWI|5|I have not ridden yet with the jacket or crashed to test its durability but it feels and looks very durable. The pads weigh down the jacket and make it feel like a reliable protection when and if I ever come very close to asphalt. I've tried it on and it feels true to size. I purchased a medium jacket and it feels great (I'm 5'11&#34; & 165lb). I can't wait to get my Ducati Scrambler to try it out for real. If I ever have any problems I will update my post. Btw, you can stow a helmet shield/visor in the jacket for when you have to ride in different lighting conditions.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Beautiful. Better than described.
B00J114CHQ|2|Did not have the components  inside
B00AUK7O0O|5|Great mat for my Grandson's Knick's basket ball  themed room but wish it was bigger for the court experience.
B003DGL24G|5|Hard to say much about an anode, heck, it is an anode. This fits and is the recommended model for my SW10DE. I must be lucky with water sources and I can go as long as 4 years with only about a 50% deterioration rate. When they do get to about 50% I replace the anode. I keep two spares as you never know when you or a buddy or neighbor will need one. There is no &#34;O-ring&#34; for these. I use sealant paste or tape, depends on what I have in the tool box that is easy to get to.<br /><br />Just make sure you check your thread diameter. Suburban heaters are 3/4&#34; and the Atwood's tend to be 1/2&#34;.
B003TKPR56|3|Ok so i just installed and i want to share my experiance. Packaging was fine and it arrived undamaged. Throw the instructions in the garbage. After removing the stock airbox i test fit the new intake. The first thing i noticed was the rubber elbow they provide was not really the correct lenth or shape. The fit was very tight to the point i was worried vibration would cause the filter to knock against other items in the engine compartment. When i got i to actually connecting it up, the tubing they provided for the coolant was way off for size.  The inside diameter of the tubing was half what it needed to be. I called DC and they had me email a photo and have not heard back. Went to local autoparts store and got what i needed. I had to trim about 1/2 inch off the elbow to get it to kinda fit. after finishing the install the test drive went fine. The sound was impressive. When the vtec kicks in there is a nice howl. My biggest issue was lack of attention to detail on fit. Oh and its not really POLISHED, its painted with silver and clearcoat which is probably better in the long run but they shoul not advertise as such.
B000L9QRE8|3|I was not happy that i had to take it to a locksmith to clean it up because the key would not work.
B00NPQ4MZ0|4|Would have given it 5 stars but the LED on one of the switches does not work and was supposed to be given the option of LED color but did not work when ordering, but is a nice set up.
B000CN925Y|5|very good
B006I25G6C|5|This brake hardware kit just works. All parts are of excellent quality. It's nice to work with all new parts when changing out the brake drums, as it saves a lot of cleaning time and gives you the piece of mind that the hardware is all new again.
B00008RW9U|5|My original duster is over 20 years old and still works like a champ. I bought a second duster for my wife to use in the house and she loves how it works on her fine cherry furniture. The three dusters purchased on this order were given as gifts to friends who recently purchased new vehicles.
B00MTHPAN4|5|Awesome!
B0026CG5S6|5|Very quick and easy to install... no wind noise even at 70mpg.  I don't know why anyone would be the outside the channel ventshades.  I had outside the channel ventshades on my last truck and they shake and create a lot of noise on the highway.
B00OU5LOT2|4|It is a great high quality product. Having it for a while it is a pleasure to have! Very great vibrant lights and the colors really pop out at night. In the daytime it is slightly visible (of course) depending if it is sunny or not. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the music functionality was minimal I hoped for more but it is okay. Great product based on quality, lighting, and options of installing.
B004U3TQJ4|5|Beautiful, Put them on a 67 Ford Truck
B00YXHCYSC|4|good product  works great
B00EAXFK7G|5|Great price, easy installation
B006IV81MO|5|I ordered these for my sister, and she loves them
B00Z820Z8C|2|Why sell food grade buckets without lids?  Should be more clear in the description. People are busy and need straightforward information.
B000P3YYTK|5|Perfect fit.
B00CYLHD94|5|Love it and so doesn't my pup
B000C8T96Q|5|Works wonderfully. I waited over a month to see how long this cabin filter would last before losing its smell filtering &#34;potency&#34; and till this day I can pass near farms and dairies and not smell the funk when the interior air circulator is on, also there has been no dust build up on the air vents like I was getting using only the OEM Cabin Filters which are more expensive I might add. It has helped tremendously and I will definitely buy it again in the reccomended 30,000 mile maintenance according to the needs of a 2006 Honda Accord 4 Cylinder. Save yourself $50 and do it yourself it only takes 5 minutes max to do.
B00N4M73TC|1|Looked great. Broke right away. Plastic.
B00IASSKPQ|3|perfect
B00CXUM7YC|5|Replaced a different aftermarket kit that was having idel/ low end issues. Whole new throttle response. Excellent purchase
B008B5X5GC|5|On time delivery everything works perfect
B0002SR2RY|5|Perfect tool for removing the oil pressure switch from my oil filter adapter on my 01 Cadillac Deville
B00HEC8LB2|5|This ABS sensor worked perfectly on my mountaineer. I received it when the seller specified and it was so easy to install.
B00763NI3A|1|The description said white and I received a yellow bulb. My OEM bulb is brighter than this weak LED.
B007SS2XMK|5|Works wonderful,better than what I had in the bike before.
B00WOT3YM6|4|Works,  If bigger type for pressure units. Perfect.
B000E8INYI|3|Wish I would have paid more for a<br />heavier duty set
B0024NO9CG|5|Arrived exactly in the middle of the stated time range.  VERY well packed. Looked exactly like the originals in every respect I could see.  Mounted perfectly, adjusted easily.
B00VUP3Y34|5|very good working nice
B00TXS95F6|5|This mirror gives you an excellent view.  Makes operating the forklift safer.
B00KI6M1G2|1|Not real happy with this light.
B00SZK26T0|5|I bought the H11's which arrived quickly. They are made of high quality materials and are very bright. They are almost brighter than my stock Lexus HID's.
B00BME02FQ|5|Husband loves it !
B00I176LPM|3|They look great on the car! But thats about it! They are very flimsy and rattle down the highway when i drive. The nuts that attach the louvers are all rusted.The price was cheap. If you dont expect a lot you will not be disappointed.
B008F8QG1Q|5|They worked great the lady is happy.
B00C5RBRA8|1|Fell apart at the joint where the hose meets the coupling after the 3rd use
B000EQ2PP8|3|The have excellent stopping power, but for some reason they made a TON of noise on my 5 lug tacoma. Ear piercing squeal. I emailed the manufacturer, and they sent a new set ASAP, which is awesome and thus 3/5 stars.<br /><br />Still a huge pain to go back and have to have them re-installed. But manufacturer did the right thing by sending new ones out.
B00Y3H4W6O|5|Very impressed!
B00S1X8GJK|5|The pants are very well made, with good fabric and an excellent fit at a fair price. You WILL like these pants.<br />The only draw back was that the next size was shipped to me - Sequoia team did offer to have it exchanged at no cost. Was truly impressed by customer service - needed it delivered in time as I was travelling - Sequoia team ensured I received my order on time.
B00CRQSYY4|5|As a professional auto and truck technician I am very impressed with this set.  The relay pliers that come in the set work great and the set has a huge variety of adapters and jumpers to use when testing.  Amazon has a way better deal on this than you will find on the tool truck.
B001YALKWM|5|Fit perfect. Great quality. Easy to install and remove. Not like those cheapies you get from Walmart. Well worth little extra money to get one that fits.
B006N9F1HY|2|This appears to be a quality link.  It may not be good as the original but the joints seem to be sufficiently sealed off from contaminants.  Update: Lasted only about 12 months.
B000C9S4RU|5|Very good deal. A better package than available from chain stores since it has included quality heat shrink butt connectors.
B00009PGNS|5|After reading a lot of reviews - good and bad - for this cooler, I ordered one. This one replaces a much smaller 9 can cooler (different brand). First of all, it is very quiet. Above road noise, the radio, and the cabin fan, I can't hear it at all. Koolatron may have gotten some bad fans - a lot of people complain about noise - this one is infinitely quieter than the smaller cooler. This cooler would benefit from a gasket for the lid (which I'll probably add). The only thing that is slightly off is the interior fan shroud - it does not fit well, and I'm not sure if I can straighten it or not. There is a bit of a gap all down the right side - which means that some of the air is not moving across the cold plate. I think our friends to the north could do a bit better. Other than that, this cooler is great. Plenty of room, and cooled down to 40 degrees in about 40 minutes - in the car. I'm going to try an inverter and 120 volt adapter to see if that's any better or different than the 12 volt plug in. Unlike the much smaller coolers, this one has an interior fan to distribute the cold air - which means you can't totally pack it full - the air needs to circulate. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase.
B000CO7Y4E|5|Work Great. Look Great.
B00F2RNGRU|5|Actually looks good on my harley
B00SZK1420|4|Love the new fog lights, not as bright as I had expected.  Still way better than stock!!!!
B00JIEX722|5|Good product...
B0031GVBFS|5|This OEM (not Hyundai genuine product) cabin air filter fits my 2013 Hyundai Elantra perfectly. It costs half of the Hyundai genuine air filter. That's OK, as I plan to change it more often. The installation is super easy. No special skill and not tool is needed. There are plenty DIY video on the web teaches you how to change the air filter. I am going to stock up couple of more....
B00A2WL0EQ|5|Nice
B001JT5JVQ|5|best stuff on the market for those who like to shin er up all the time..
B008QVC96S|4|By far- the best fitting seat covers I've ever had in the Silverado. They feel very durable and look like they're part of the original interior layout. I'm a contractor and I tend to be very rough on the inside of my trucks so I have to be prepared. This being my favorite truck, I wanted an upgrade in material toughness so, I went for it!  If they perform well through the next year I'll upgrade this to a 5 star easily!
B001GH1LWM|5|Looks better than stock.. thanx guys..
B00V9HPH9C|3|great lights, but there isn't any difference between dim and bright. They are installed correctly, maybe I need to readjust the lamp housing.
B000B6KUG2|4|Good product. Been driving around with them on a lot and they have never gotten loose or vibrated like others I've had in the past. The only thing wrong with them is the mounting. The pads they give you to keep from scratching your mirror backs is not sufficient. I have an older truck with a few battle scars so no big deal for me but if I had a newer truck I'd be livid. So if you get a set do yourself a favor and add some padding of your own.
B00429NKWK|5|Good results that lasted about nine months.  Asked my mechanic if there's a better way, he suggested a certain body shop.  Called and they said $75-100 per light and it might last two years.  So for $20 and an hour of work, this product is worth it to keep my headlights looking good.
B00ALJ4SG2|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B00W2ZWMKM|5|it was good.
B00NUAIYIC|1|Colors and detail are very muddied. Smell fades quickly.
B00S499ZIW|1|not like the originals(very different) and did not fit my 2003Ls<br /><br />did not fit my 2003 LS. the lexus symble on the original is set in or slightly sunk in, on this set the lexus symbol is raised, it Will not look right if you try to replace just one, plus as i said before they dont fit.
B00FAVPNRE|5|I ordered this set of risers for my 2004 Volusia 800 because the factory risers weren't high enough for me.  Being 6'4&#34;, I was hunched over my bike for most of the time on a ride.  Upon installing these, I was in a more natural position, with my back straighter and arms in a more neutral position.  For installation, I recommend red loctite for mounting to the triple tree, and blue loctite for the handlebar mounts.  It's not included, but I recommend it.  Installation was about 1/2 hour, and most of that was removal of the headlight and routing of the clutch and brake cables.  With the risers being machined from 6061-T6 aluminum billet,  they're more solid than other risers you'll find that are cast or hollow.  Their weight is a bit heavier than expected, but not bad.
B001F8OX6I|5|very nice product good seller
B0016HZZ0Q|5|Perfect fit for my 2007 silverado(new body style)!! It fixed my sound issue. I now have full sound all the time, not just when it gets really hot out.
B00F676FH4|5|Awesome. Exactly as described. Genuine gm parts
B0062IJURS|4|perfect fit
B0002Z9R52|1|This was a recommended item based on the make and model of my car, however the part did not fit and wasn't even close to fitting. Now I have to pay to ship back the wrong part back? Last time I trust amazon for making a suggestion.
B00PTQOF4W|5|Everything as described shipped with in time frame listed
B007HSLOL2|5|I served in the US Army Infantry I have this on my truck.

B003VWFJCS|5|Perfect!! Love this product. So comfortable
B00FRCXE90|3|The horn works like it's supposed to but it wasn't built very solid. After only a week in my jeep, the horn started to come apart and I had to reglue it and tapped it back together.
B000TYQB14|5|fast easy install, better than the original. much brighter.
B000B8LKSW|4|Exactly as advertised.  Good deal.
B001EOWQ5I|5|Works perfectly!
B0002I94CA|5|Fit perfect. Nice product
B00KN0UOEE|5|This is the best stuff ever. Does what it claims.
B00G9FYMQ8|5|Great size
B00EAAN1I4|1|Wouldn't peel off easily ended up destroying it trying to seperate it from the paper it was adhered to
B007PP23H6|5|bright and sticks great
B008Y3O2BI|5|Good quality. Works great.
B00BITICRA|1|I havent even received the part yet and I'm already annoyed, there is a tool to help you find if the part is compatible and before ordering this I used to tool to see if it was the right part, and it said it would work, I checked the part page this morning for tracking details and it showed that this part wasn't compatible with my model car, so I redid it to see if maybe I accidentally changed it but nope, still not compatible
B003L33KKK|5|Product of the united states? whats that mean?
B000BRRHZS|5|Great product works awesome
B0013FXXGE|5|Installs easy and works great..
B00BJJZ2QS|5|These are a must have you would not believe what you are not seeing these should be factory standard
B005JU5V6E|4|These wiper work pretty well.  I don't really have any complaints.
B00KKRDR7G|4|Item arrived in a timely manner.  Unfortunately there was some denting/damage to the plate that holds the lifter arms together.  It also cost me 11.00$ and a trip to the hardware store to but a set of bolts, screws and washers that was missing ( tire support connectors ).  We ended up with a part that I have no idea where it goes.  Possibly this was a part inserted instead of the set of connectors I needed for the tire supports.  The item itself is quite handy.  Seems a little less sturdy than I had hoped but does the job it is intended for.  Lift height is 20&#34; -  I had hoped for more clearance but it does get me to the blades and deck.  When the tractor is lifted, the lift carriage moves towards the mower to accommodate, so be aware of this.
B00AESWC0E|5|Came quick.  Love it
B002GI42DU|5|It's some good stuff from what I hear. Put this in after some Redline MT-90 killed the bearings in my 05 xB trans with hopes this stuff would cure the noise. Nope...but my 5th gear stopped grinding as much.
B000NWA50U|5|Fit a 2005 Z71 Chevy Tahoe with no issues. Super easy install.
B00ZQ4GF54|5|They ARE amazing! !!they add a different fell to the car
B004I1BEW0|3|Cons: Not extremely easy to adjust, must be very careful doing so too. Pros: Lights are pretty bright & the price is very affordable in comparison to other parts.
B000E63MAA|3|Did not fix my issue, the shifter does not lock into place. Do not know if the neutral safety switch was the issue
B004AGESRG|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00OBWTIYW|5|Received my purchase very fast and it was as advertised.
B00HJWSMRU|5|Work like they should
B0041TTXW2|5|Perfect fit and color match for my truck.
B00HG1PN2Q|5|Did the job about a year ago and still holding no coolant leak, the only thing is I had to get more sanding paper for the tube to fit all the way inside, but other than that great kit.
B00EEG75E0|1|They didn't fit my car 2011 Toyota Camry SE
B00GXQ2J5O|5|Perfect Custom fit
B008B5U5U6|5|Worked as described.
B000GU0RBG|5|I bought one of these for each of my bikes and they fit great. It's a little baggy on my smaller bike but I didn't want to have to deal with different sizes. I purchased these to keep the bikes dust free in the garage and I don't think they would bring much value for use outdoors. Here are the bikes I bought them for:<br />(1) '14 Suzuki V-Strom 1000<br />(2) '09 Yamaha V Star 250<br />(3) '01 Suzuki DR-Z400S
B00C80HL98|3|It does the job
B00437IHOC|1|Upon receiving the winch I found that both batteries were faulty -- charger lights showed different faults for each battery -- Warn may know winches but I question their depth of battery technology experience. As far as I can see batteries are a weak suit for Warn
B002NL3U7O|5|This fit our needs perfectly.  Fits great under the seat of our supercab F150 and gives us the extra storage we needed.  I would absolutely recommend this item.. Very fast shipping, too!
B007KP52QU|5|Perfect fit - easy to install and made my truck look 10 years younger!
B00NQ198LC|2|I bought these because they were cheaper than the Thule brand ones. They fit perfectly, however, they are not effective by any means.<br />I can open up the lock quite easily by jiggling it (something I accidentally discovered while using the wrong key for the lock).<br /><br />So if security is what you are after, suck it up and buy the brand name ones.
B003NHH6LI|5|100%
B0074S7F5O|2|its nice but really pricey for its size i feel
B000CF8VUE|5|This was in addition to my truck and I'm so happy I went with them both easy to install and look excellent
B000AXUPPW|5|Works Great
B005I9AN0U|4|Fits perfectly
B00F3W7DVO|3|Helmet is okay.  The visor is not UV.  My prescription glasses turn dark underneath.  Does not really matter, except the description says that it is.  The chin strap is a little close to the neck and so it tends to pull a little on my throat if I dont get it situated just right.  other than that it is a good helmit for the price.
B00AKUGN6A|1|These did not work in my vehicle at all (would not light up)  Had to go out and buy regular incandescent bulbs
B0041U39AI|5|Great service and just as advertized
B0053TVKT8|5|Good quality. Works good for what it was designed.
B007FGR852|2|Fit ok, easy enough to install. Missing a screw and is pretty cheaply made. Not terrible for the money though.
B00OJ2E06K|5|Great decal. All my budies want one now. Shipping was very quick.
B00CZANRSA|4|Seats fit really well, however, headrests seemed to be for a different car. The back headrests were perfect, just the front headrest covers were a little off, but too much trouble to go through return/exchanges, so manageable.
B004Y4Y5TK|5|great
B00TEG12XU|5|High quality and holding up well under fairly heavy use
B001O7PNXC|5|Great, thanks A+
B0049O4SYC|5|Worked as expected
B00LLH8Q5C|5|It actually jump-started my friend's Yukon
B00T6JARP4|5|Excellent quality chrome, very nice looking on the bike.  Comes with spanner wrench.  These are very fat compared to stock HD shocks, you will need to purchase or fabricate spacers to clear your fender as well as purchase longer bolts.  Lowered rear of bike 2&#34;!
B00JALAP8W|4|Good
B00DNJE8Q2|5|These windscreen bolts came as described. They showed up in only a couple of days, and they were an exact fit on my 07 1098. They look great. The quality is better than stock, and they have a regular hex head on the bolts. Very satisfied. Thanks!
B008H2ZTEU|5|Just what described
B0041HN1HM|5|It's a master lock I'm just saying... :0)
B0000VY0K0|5|Great product for the price! I can actually feel my Honda Accord EX 2001 accelerate faster now.
B00AETUVM4|5|worked good
B00DPFK840|5|The logo is good quality -- all metal not plastic.
B00AERSDWG|4|Easy to read using the colors.
B001FC74P6|4|Worked perfectly for their intended purpose, but I graded them a 4 rather than 5 because of the reversed cranking direction — namely, clockwise runs them down rather than up which is what one would expect & vice-versa. However, I was aware of that &#34;issue&#34; when I ordered them so it wasn't a huge problem. My solution would be to weld a nut onto the opposite end of the screw so they would conform to normal &#34;up/down&#34; cranking logic.
B0009IQZFM|5|Fast Delivery, great product
B000C7VY8I|5|Fit perfectly and included all necessary hardware.
B009NOPQO4|1|Not a sway bar bushing kit.  More like a control arm bushing kit. NOT AS DESCRIBED
B005JZSP08|1|I was really aggravated by this. I wanted it so my youngest could fasten his own seat-belt in his booster in the back seat of the car, it's difficult with the standard latch as it doesn't extend but a fraction from the seat. However there was no indication that this wouldn't work in the back seats. It clicks into the existing rear latch just fine, but the rear seat belt buckle won't lock into the adapter and there wasn't anything I saw in the product description that brought this up.<br /><br />I got it on a flash deal so it was a great price, so good that it would have cost me almost as much in return shipping to send it back, netting me about a $1.00 refund.
B00P5YNM2O|4|great emblem decor
B001892VAE|4|Good to have to carry you windows around. Wouldn't do it any other way
B0009NUG66|5|Did everything it claimed to do. We drove with it on the car for vacation at around 8 hours both ways. We went through rain a couple times and there was no sign of water intrusion. The only thing that I didn't like about this was the wind noise it created. The noise could be reduced if you stuffed the carrier and didn't allow any voids, but that was kind of hard to do. I think you would find this problem with any soft car top carrier so don't let that stop you from buying this one. Good quality overall for the money.
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Made our ten yr. old Sunbrella look like new!
B006UH66SM|3|I received the bunks before the estimated delivery date.  First of all, they were packed in tape and plastic so be careful using a knife or scissors so you don't cut the carpet.  Second, the staples they use are not stainless steel or even appear to be galvanized.  I put a magnet to them and they stuck immediately. This is not good for saltwater fishing, so I plan on using stainless screws or aluminum nails.  Thirdly, they do look nice and you don't have to do it yourself.  So just make sure you secure he carpet like mentioned that way when the saltwater eats up the staples, the carpet won't come off.  Good luck!
B00MJ4BKWW|5|It is what I expected.  It looks like it come the truck.
B00FZQ0SHO|5|I went with the Toyota product as opposed to an aftermarket product that was admittedly a good bit cheaper.  But I'm glad I did, it is a quality product and no issues like mentioned in a number of reviews of the after market product about no being as powerful as the original and only getting the spray halfway up the windshield on a Sequoia.
B00H7HSN3A|5|My favorite, Highly recommend.  Goes on perfect, great quality.
B000IPAK9S|5|If you have an RV, this is a must have. I purchased mine for that &#34;Just in case&#34; moment. I have used it already twice because the camp site was poorly designed for my long camper.
B007AU2YN4|5|Great OEM Filter fit 2007 Forester.
B008G2YBV8|5|That was the product I expected.
B0002JN2EU|4|We use this in our old classic motorcycle!  Great price, arrived next day!!  The  packaging was not well cushioned as three of the cans were dented but no leaks!
B0035GZSP8|5|very good and fast
B006TMM9V6|4|Fast and ACCURATE sALE
B000CIG0OK|5|Very good.
B00IB4LT20|5|shipped fast, product was as described.
B003YNGWV6|5|Easy to replace,keep your bolts,great product
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|The are Awesome! i really love the way the look and my car looks really handsome (H)
B00BJP89US|5|It's been a while these are excellent. They fit my BMW 328i 2008. Works great.
B00EE6VYEW|3|Very happy with head lights, but fog lights/ lamps came without brackets
B00MS98FJO|2|Does not look like picture. Well, I guess nothing ever does, but the blue LED ring around the outside is not consistent. It has 4 dark spots. You will also likely have to drill a new hole in your headlight bucket for the LED wires as they are separate wires from the bulb light wires.
B004W5U4SW|5|the tail light was received just like u advised me it would.  it fit like a glove and just appreciate you doing what u said u would do.
B00C250JQG|3|It was ok. The leaver for the dark vizor is in the way of strapping on the safety straps . Other than that it has a good flow of air inside the helmet I live in Trinidad in the Caribbean so its veey hot here. So u want to be as cool as possible
B00O3QBERK|5|A must have for any car. Very nice look with the blue tint and can see anywhere in the back seat and blind spots.
B008BG60JU|2|Bad fit - didn't fit the vehicle as stated.
B00NN8MYA0|5|Excellent product. Delivered a few days early and in great condition. I live in the south and it get pretty hot in the summer, but the product stayed together unlike the other shifter i got from another company.
B00JGJGLWW|5|Well made!
B00TQ7WDDU|5|This is an exact replacement part for those who wish to keep their Polaris looking like new. There is no discernible difference between the replacement and the original part which ultimately failed. My only disappointment was that the vendor only had one unit in stock. Thanks!
B00PWG6AC4|5|Their jumbo. Blocks the sun. Does the job. Nuf said, yo
B007P747OG|5|Have not installed yet but everything seams to be OK
B007Y87UYK|5|Fast shipping and works great
B0024NO97Q|4|Great fit.  Good videos on line to show you how at youtube.  Do not underestimate how involved this is.  You will literally disassemble the entire front end of the car to install them.
B0089G9ZOE|5|Awesome looking and fits really well. Get a size smaller and they will conform to your hand over a short time and still be snug. If you get just your size, they will stretch over time and not fit as good. Had them for a year and still going strong.
B009MASYRA|4|The good news is that it fits perfectly. The bad news is that it fits perfectly. Which means it is just as enormous as the c-Max windshield. this makes it  inconvenient to store where you can reach it unless no one ever rides in the back seat. However, it is very effective in blocking the large amount of solar radiation that can enter through the C-Max's huge front window on a hot day.
B00XQJXGEO|5|perfect what a deal
B007LIBWU6|5|I love this thing. Sturdy and looks bad ass.
B000C53RC6|4|So far so good.  Ease to install and are a huge improvement over the worn out originals.
B004BCWJ0W|5|Proudly on my car bumper.
B006TMKL16|4|This is good item at a great price.  It helped make my 13 year old Acura RSX look new again. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the fit for the mounting holes was not perfect.  But with a little effort and finesse I got this to fit very well.
B00FZKHTOK|3|Throttle side very easy to install. Although I bought the right size for my bars, the clutch side had a lot of play in it. Thankfully, I'm very creative so I wrapped the bar with a later of cloth sports tape and Gorilla glued it on. Now it is just fine. The screws that hold the caps on the ends do rust a little. Overall, they are very comfortable. I rode out in Sturgis this year and it reduced the hand fatigue significantly. Good grips for the money.
B00368P6Y8|5|Great
B000CO9FHS|5|Was as advertised.
B00008RW9V|5|Love it.
B000HBGKWE|5|As others have said... Go to their website and watch the video. I was very careful in preparation and it seems to have worked great.
B006UH5YMG|4|Great!
B00ZE9V77C|1|the lite was applied to stem as recommended ,btw no instructions).After the first mile BOTH of the lites broke off.Waste of my money and time
B000C18Q44|5|If these fit your older vehicle, you can't do better... you can only spend more money. These headlights are very bright while remaining street-legal, AND you get a great benefit with this older technology: When you change the &#34;bulb&#34;, you get a whole, new, UNSCRATCHED and crystal-clear glass lens for free... returning your vehicle to full illumination! Why did we ever &#34;advance&#34; away from such a simple and sensible design? Oh yeah... we all love to polish out our cloudy, yellowing, weirdly-shaped and expensive polycarbonate lenses, on all recent cars - NOT!
B005FN4UE4|5|Great product.
B005S0CQ4U|4|look good
B00B2A8ZOU|5|Love it!! Was shipped pretty quickly. A few days before expected which was great. Install was super easy as long as you have the right tools. I have an 04 1500 single cab short bed HEMI and didn't need the spring compressor I rented. Don't waste your time getting it. Just jack it up high enough to drop the lower control arm down low enough slowly with a jack. Just take it slow and be safe. Can get the new spring in without it as well. I have 20&#34; rims with decent size tires and had a very small gap between the top of the tire and the front fender. Looks great now!! And no more tire rubbing. Huge difference. After installing the front it pretty much leveled it out so I didn't even use the rear blocks. Did use the shocks though. All in all I absolutely recommend this product!
B00BEDC3G6|2|Good price. But a very odd fitting helmet. Would have got 4 stars if fit and quality were better.
B000W0TM6Q|1|i've bent two of these while using a WD hitch on an F250.
B007IYCWIY|5|Love them! High quality premium gloves. They do run small, though. Be sure to order a size larger than you normally do. I ordered a large and it fits pretty snug on my hands, and it takes a bit of time to put them on.. Large gloves from other manufacturers usually are a little loose on me. Very comfortable and the hook and loop system that AlpineStars uses doesnt pull out the mesh strands. This is a nice longevity feature. I also really like the stretch cuts in the fingers. They make bending them very comfortable. I highly recommend these gloves if you ride in the summer and want to add to your visibility.<br /><br />Palm leather feels very durable and thick. It isn't impact resistant, but should hold up in a slide. Also, they match my Alpinestars T-GP Plus jacket perfectly, from colors to mesh grain.!.
B0038AX74U|3|Lights are good and very clear. Make my car look good. Installation wasnt bad but I had to splice the halo lights into another connection since they weren't already plugged in which was a pain. And the lights aren't even so I had to mess with them and even them out.
B00FFXDTEQ|5|Got it all together love it !!
B000CAXF5U|5|A hefty filter with lots of filter media, this filter is larger than the standard replacement for my Honda S2000, allowing about an extra quart of oil capacity. I feel more confident running longer oil filter change intervals with this large filter, as opposed to the factory size filter.<br /><br />A 15 flute, 80mm oil filter wrench makes removal and replacement easier. Additionally the filter which arrived at my door is painted red, but has the appropriate B202 model number and other markings.
B006OQ35GU|4|Smaller than I thought it would be, but a very good, tight fit.
B002XA4PLA|5|I saw this this decal and had to have it to add to my decals on my truck. Looks great and the price is right.fast shipping
B00OGOTVJC|5|I wanted something brighter for my motorcycle directional. I used my camera meter to check the old with the new bulbs and these were clearly brighter than the old set.
B003TKI4VU|3|never ordered this bulb
B008URJHYU|5|Makes me feel like I can work on a car again.
B0136I3S4C|4|This BESTEK BTCS99 power bank is designed for maximum portability; it's not a big, rugged, powerful, beast given its 5400mAh capacity and 300 peak amp boost, but it easily fits in your glove box or center console. The unit is just 5 inches long, 3 inches wide, about 3/4 of an inch thick, and weighs in only at 7.4 ounces (per our postal scale).<br /><br />The battery and all of its accessories could fit into a quart-size ziploc bag... but the manufacturer did not include a carry bag or pouch to put the battery and its accessories in. That's a shame.<br /><br />This device could be an emergency power kit for many needs on an excursion or camping trip. Recommended if you are looking for lightweight battery back up power for your trip in the urban jungle, especially if in a smaller vehicle like our Saturn Vue (2.2L in-line 4 cylinder engine).<br /><br />Nice concept; a portable 5400 mAh power bank with a USB power port (2.1A) allowing us to plug in a device's USB cable as needed, ports and cables for a variety of other electronic devices (tablets, laptops, etc...), and short alligator clip cables to connect to the car battery. Good tool for its size, functionality and price.<br /><br />Operating this unit to charge a cell phone is a breeze -- just plug your cable (or the supplied micro-USB cable) into the USB port and do your thing. If you need the jumper cables, just open the rubber flap covering the port on the end of the unit (next to the standard USB port), plug in the jumper cables, and then connect the cable to your battery as directed in the user guide. The cables are fairly short so do be careful when using them.<br /><br />The storage capacity of this battery is good and the charging times we experienced were fine. We tested it with an HTC Droid DNA and it charged quickly, about 3/4% per minute (45% per hour) using the 2.1A port... much better rate than we get from our wall outlet adapters.<br /><br />The little flashlight on the back panel does not emit a great deal of light, but it does work. Holding the power button down for a few seconds turns it on (or back off); pressing the power button while the flashlight is on will cycle it from constant on, to SOS, and to medium speed strobe... again, nothing brilliant here, just a modest light.<br /><br />No warranty information that I could find, so if a problem occurs within that a reasonable period of time I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. Smaller size battery storage and peak amps, minimal flashlight, and the lack of a storage/carry bag... four stars instead of 5.<br /><br />If you are looking for a portable, lightweight power bank & car jumper kit of this style, size, price and functionality, for use similar to what I have described above, then we would recommend giving this unit a try.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.<br /><br />We received this item gratis from the seller without obligation, and decided to objectively test and review it.

B00PWG6AC4|4|These things are big for any small car. My BMW 335i's windows were a bit smaller than the shades. It's also difficult to fold these up and I look ridiculous fighting with these in my car as I'm trying to fold them up. Maybe those with bigger cars would have more luck. I personally prefer the solid covers for speedy installation and removal.
B010SNV2SC|5|My son LOVES this!  As soon as I got it he begged me for it!  He said is is of good quality and extremely bright!  He wants another one!  I bought it for our boat but he put it on his truck.  This thing has so many uses.  It's a great spotlight.  It's a lot better than most and a lot brighter than most.  I purchased this at a discount in exchange for an honest opinion.  My opinion is that we like it so much we want more!
B001AI1ERE|5|These look amazing and without baffles are down right scary sounding. With baffles they sounded great. Absolutely love them.
B0024DYQ2O|5|worked on our rv door
B00R16WUHC|2|...I asked a bunch of questions about this item but none were answered. I still bought them tho since the price was good and they included 10000k HIDs.<br /><br />I wish they would have listed what kind of bulbs you need. Replacing the bulbs after installation is near impossible without removing the front bumper and grill.<br /><br />The latch that holds the HID headlights in place suck too. I got the passenger side to stay put but the driver side kept popping off the bracket. I had to use an abundant amount of electrical tape just to get it locked in there. Also, there was no way to seal the unit after installation so I drilled a hole on the cover panel big enough for the rubber grommet and more electrical tape.<br /><br />Adjusting the level of the headlights doesn't seem to work for me. My headlights are aimed pretty high at the moment.<br /><br />Final note:<br />I just noticed this seller had this item listed twice and the other listing got negative reviews. Wish I saw it before I made this purchase.
B00407V5B2|5|Matches pretty well with my silver 2005 corolla. There's a bit of a learning process with these sorts of things, so make sure to look up youtube vides etc before trying to repaid sections of your car.
B006XK9YCG|5|Looks good BUT on a 2002 with the single piece A pillar and roof trim, these are about four inches short.  Trimworks has excellent customer service.  These go on top of (they do not replace) the factory trim.  IMHO the car looks better with factory painted trim, but its a hassle and pricey to get these pieces repainted.
B004L04TD4|5|These triangles come with sand-weighted bases to help keep them upright.  Great deal!
B00N9LMXUC|3|Does not fit Honda Odyssey. More for a car or small suv.
B0036PQ7A8|5|good job
B00PG2QA1K|4|Not that sturdy but it's a good side table for a cup of coffee
B000EDUTWM|5|perfect
B000BZZF0Y|5|Easy to install.  Works perfectly for my 1998 Nissan Sentra.
B00K9LV6UI|4|its sitting in a 8.6 second mustang.
B0002KKIXC|5|We have a dog and use this product when he has an accident
B004ZKVUCI|5|I love paying a fraction of the OEM parts and getting something that fits right and works right.
B0041IDA2C|4|In Florida, license plates are not needed on the fronts of vehicles.  So, on bumpers, there are &#34;placeholders&#34; for plates.  This decorative plate is perfect for that purpose.  However, if you place it on the vehicle without some kind of protective outer frame/plate, this item won't last long. I purchased a black frame with a built in clear plastic cover and put this butterfly plate behind it.  It should last quite a long time in this configuration.
B00YIA2VH8|5|love it...fits great in my malibu
B000CQOIVO|5|nice heavy duty jack.
B00RUZNYFQ|2|Easy to install. But after 2 months I can hear rattle noise in left rear strut.
B00A3FMFNC|4|Paint is nice. Quality is decent. Latches are flimsy. I expect to have to change them out sooner than later. Was advertised as a direct fit but was not on my 00 Roadking Classic. I had to fabricate 2 brackets to make them work. Also had to shave down the 2 saddlebag filler panels between the rear fender and the bags. Total install time was about 2 hours. I expected to have to make some mods to make them fit. Overall a nice purchase. The price was great! and the quality was satisfactory. Only giving 4 starts because they where advertised as a direct fit and where not. They are a huge upgrade over the factory bags. I would recommend. Pics below!
B00JRH6D8A|5|Very cute, just be careful when you do it. Mine ripped a little while trying to peel it
B0036GIDZY|5|Best stuff I ever used! I will never use anything else ever again! Thank you S100!
B00COYNVPQ|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B001DCERZI|1|This is mis-labeled. This is the center speed sensor for the differential. The correct number for the left or right wheel is the ALS1938.
B00IYCHRCK|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B000GZQIN2|1|I wanted to give this product/transaction 0 stars but you have to select at least one. As far as the product goes, well, it looks nice and it looks well made and it looks very functional but what good are looks if it doesn't effing fit. The box is labeled 98 to 00 GL1500 ALL. I have a factory stock 1998 GL1500SE, with factory stock engine crash guards and factory stock valve covers. The mounting bracket for the highway pegs, which mount to the crash guards, are too thick to fit between the guard and the valve cover. It does me no good if it doesn't fit and now I have to go through the hassle of returning it.
B00JKE5PV6|5|It works, just make sure to use a relay and not run lots of amp through it.
B00I9F3WCG|3|This is my second one, it seems like its defective.
B005F3G5BA|5|excellent product for price
B00BLPS29E|5|Great lock that you can vary positions and quickly remove
B00UJLA44W|5|Good
B000C9IBCI|5|Yup, that was the part, fit right in
B006FXUMO0|4|Quick and easy, it would have been nice if the wires on the left side for the power module were longer so it could be mounted more securely. The two sided tape didn't work very well.
B00F7H04UM|5|excellent quality
B00471T798|5|Great Staff. I love it.
B00REJX764|4|The product was great came in on time and very easy to install I would of gave it 5 stars but I think the cover could be wider to cover the bed rails more but looks great on my 2015 Silverado..
B00HDRCGDW|3|The product arrived as indicated, somehow works ok.  The fuse keeps burning.  I use it with an Xbox 1 only.
B003VGHAY4|5|This light fitted perfectly and looked identical the the other, my biggest mistake was not buying two when I bought the first. I then bought a second one later. The thing is what I paid for two was still less the price of one original. The detail on these lights are great and the quality of the materials used was just as good as the originals, which i decided to changed because one started to take in water, and the other was badly oxidized.
B000P17NXQ|5|Fairly straightforward to install, minus some customization to the wiring harness specific to my VW. I used this controller for the first time to bring our new 24' travel trailer home, and I could barely tell it was back there. Braked worked well after a little adjusting on the local streets. The controller is easy to use and understand and takes out a lot of the voodoo that seems to be associated with these things.<br /><br />I used this page as a guide: http://rennlist.com/forums/porsche-cayenne-forum/189872-cayenne-prodigy-brake-controller-install-with-pictures.html
B00PT6ZIFW|5|Great product, at a great price! 5 stars!
B000WK5PWQ|5|Our Yamaha dealer recommended this product.  Bottom line, our experience is this is an excellent detail product that truly does make the plastic, black and other colors look vibrant.  I was so impressed that I began using it on my truck and suv to dress the black trim.  I also found it does a nice job on Moto Metal center caps.
B0017PQF1U|3|These are very thin and can only be used a couple of times for the best results.  Therefore, they are VERY expensive to use.
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Arrived early and is great quality.
B000DT7Y70|5|Very satisfied with it and the whole transaction.
B00BV6UQTW|1|The assembly arm, after being properly installed, snapped under the driver side wiper arm two months into use.
B0037R712I|5|Perfect fit and easy installation. Will definitely purchase these Wagner pads again when needed for my other vehicles.
B0007VANHW|5|Very nice hitch, easy to install.
B000H8XK5W|5|got a great price and it was in excellent condistion
B004I0I1PE|4|Great price for this product.  Came in very shiny and glowed brilliantly.<br /><br />Two bad things are that the holes for the screws are not pre-drilled.  I broke off my screws trying to screw them in to the product.  Pre-drilling is a must for these!<br /><br />The second bad thing is that after a few months it looks like cracks have developed in the lights.<br /><br />I had to replace my old ones because they cracked and water was getting in the shorting out my turn signal bulbs.  It appears that these have cracked too and pretty soon after I installed them.  Not sure if it is because of the product or a combination of the weather or my driving.<br /><br />But price wise you can't beat the deal.
B00JF5HR7K|5|Great product!  Heavy duty construction.  Came in handy on our family road trip.  Didn't even realize it was on the truck.  It also sits far enough back so that I was still able to open tailgate!  Great buy
B00HJ6SMTY|5|this is a great product and will recommend to all friends
B002X1NLOQ|5|I'm pleased with the product. Fast delivery
B00QMWQSAG|5|Good quality better thicker than store brand
B00SBZRELY|1|Only lasted for about 4 lawnmower tank fillings - Failed my expectations miserably!!! Great concept - Poor design too much money for a flop!
B0041TQS5M|5|Great fitment and great filter overall. Easy to install.
B00SF4O56S|5|E-home microfiber cleaning cloths for Boats, RVs, Cars and Trucks -10 pack was definately a great buy. I am funny about cleaning and I like to know that everything I cleaned was cleaned and cleaned well. So to test this out I used them a few ways. I gave my brother one to use to clean his motorcycle. Needless to say he loved it and came and got a second one so he can wax his bike as well. My mother used them to clean the kitchen and she said that they were good. They left no streaks at all on the stainless steel appliances. She was happy and demanded that I leave the lot of them at her house because she has so much to clean. So in turn I took two for myself. I have a brand new audi and these were great for cleaning the inside of it. I truly couldn't be happier about it. The dashboard looks amazing now. I was able to clean all the windows with ease. These really are great. I would definatly recommend them for use. They are also a nice size. Not too large and not too small. I really like them. I received this product at a promotional price in exchange for my honest and true findings.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|So easy to clean which is a plus with two kids and the beach.
B00BTIN7SO|1|Bought this itemfor my wife's stationary exercise bike. The backrest does not move forward enough to support her back and up/down adjustment slips down while using the bike and thus does not meet the expectations we had for purchasing the item.
B004GEELME|5|Fixed my signal blinker and headlight high-beam problems.
B00M0CBV9U|5|Worked as expected for our 1,000 mile trip.  Good choice
B000OCHBFQ|4|So far working just fine, nice to have product that works with R12 & R134
B00CAXEZA6|4|Timely and accurate
B00MC6RQAM|5|Did not work in my 09 Avalanche. I am not sure if I may have gotten a bad set , I tested the sockets, swapped them back and forth and reversed/ flipped  the bulbs, and they still didn't work. I have nothing but JDM ASTAR  LED's in the rest of my truck and I couldnt be happier  they have great Customer Service usually and I tried contacting them but never heard back!!!  so I am a little disappointed that they didn't work.  Update I got them to work, afterwards I also replaced my tai lights with the LED Spyders  These Reverse bulbs are brighter than my headlights!
B005S39PWS|5|Cut through both a K&N and WIX filter like butter.  Works great, and will be nice to inspect the filters when removed now.
B007RHA5KE|2|I needed some for the ramp to my shed as I slipped in my boots the other day and nearly twisted my ankle.  It's made of OSB for the ramp and I figured this would do the trick.  It did not - I sprayed several layers on the wood - it went on easy...but didn't create any traction at all for me to walk on the OSB.  Perhaps it would do better on a different surface etc... but in my case it was a waste of money.
B003TTN362|4|Not as plush as I would have liked, or appeared in the picture.  Otherwise, works well enough.
B000C9S75O|5|These are hard to find. The are no longer in production. They are correct replacements for older Gm cars.
B000GTU686|4|Allows you to disassemble a set of Progressive shocks so that you can change spring rates or service.  Does what it is supposed to really well, quality build.  Would definitely recommend to anyone that is needing to break down one of their shocks.
B000CQ49X6|5|Worked Perfect!
B000E9Z49Y|1|I use, and enjoy, a lot of Mothers' products.  This one is a miss.  No matter what I do, this product always leaves streaks, and it doesn't clean as well as my other window cleaner.
B0031I207O|3|I liked the quality of this cover and really appreciated that it came with a storage case. The downside is that it won't fit any of my bikes. I bought it for am '09 Yamaha VStar 250 but it was too small to completely cover. Amazon was great in issuing a credit right away.
B003VASRCE|5|Works great! Really light weight and strong.

B000JFJM14|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B005OWQHKG|5|love it, loved the size and was really easy to apply! thank you!
B008QR1ASK|5|did the job
B00E1L72RS|5|Using for my M.B. custs clear from sun, and cools
B007WR25GG|5|Awesome product. I do not have a roof rack so I just strapped it on through the doors as suggested. It worked perfectly with no complaints after a 1,000 mile drive. I probably only had it about 2/3 full at most but I found that if I loaded the entire width of the bag in the front there was absolutely no flapping noise. There is a bit of wind noise when you go through the door because it pushes down the weather seal which lets some wind through. I wouldn't say that it really interrupted anything or was disruptive to normal conversation but it was louder than normal.<br /><br />Lastly, this thing is huge, in a good way. It swallowed everything I threw in it and had room for more. I found myself looking for stuff to bring camping just to see how much I could fit in it. I ran out of stuff before I ran out of room.
B00J1WEOP0|5|Good
B00EKS5FJO|5|This stuff is amazing!  The last time I dipped my wheels I ran out of dip, so I used spray paint. Not the greatest idea.  I tried everything to get it off and nothing worked. Paint thinner, paint stripper, carb cleaner, nothing worked.  I decided to order the dip dissolver and it worked effortlessly.  The dip/spray paint combo was on the wheels for almost a year and I sprayed this stuff on, let it sit for 5 minutes and a pressure washer took it right off.  Definitely a must have for thin dip or stubborn dip that wont come off.  Beyond impressed with this product!
B00HSILHMM|5|Perfect for the job
B00NT5VDZ4|3|Love th way this looks but it got dirty pretty quickly!
B00HQHTMM2|4|Well priced, high quality product
B005JZTNLI|4|works as expected.  no problems.
B000E28CKY|5|great
B004GW5LOS|5|Product Definitely met our expectations and the company was easy to deal with.
B00VSAHT7I|5|They fit and look great
B0100FK1X0|1|Needed to order more parts when every other one I had came with everything.
B00KYS2WYA|4|Excellent interior and exterior products. Only issue is with the tire/rubber spray. Any liquid that hits the ground will leave a permanent stain.
B00S1UG4C4|5|Great for polishing/cleaning cars, motorcycles etc......excellent quality.
B00696Y74O|5|works great for great.
B00A6GHJ66|5|Great product as described.

B001HBMKCC|5|This stuff works great
B00GSAUHB8|5|Just as described. So far its working like a charm.
B001KO84I0|5|Simply works well.
B005MZZF8A|5|Yes, we need to share that we care.  Some our beloved men & women have &#34;lost some, while others gave all&#34;. Great quality!  Thank you
B007N6QM2O|3|Didn't even come close to fitting my TJ.  Use their web site to check lengths before ordering.
B00496F0HY|5|Worked as expected
B001DHE78K|5|Fit perfectly. No problems so far.
B00HBHCA8U|5|Perfect. Exactly what was advertised
B00RVXG9YA|5|They we're great
B00D5FNARW|3|leaves hands feeling grease, cleans off grease well.
B00SH1SN6C|4|I would like to order 2ng one for same price.
B009S9RRQ4|4|Love it I get a lot of people that compliment that this has to be the funniest decal they've ever seen
B00LHCFE9W|3|Very very small, like the descp said 1 inch, However, they are  bright. I like the fact that they come with plug & play extensions. There is no &#34; last function &#34; memory recall, you have to push 2 buttons to get the desired effect ( strobe pattern ) . I bought 2 sets so i can custom build what i want.
B000WEPI4M|4|I am happy to say I received exactly what I wanted in a timely manner<br /><br />What else is there<br /><br />Except- Thanks
B000E35UXA|5|Drove around without a horn/cruise control for a year thinking it would cost to much to fix. For $44 and a youtube video it was a very easy fix. Note to first timers: looking at the new clockspring connections can help you to disconnect the old one and apply the new one. Took less than an hour and could probably do a second one in 20 minutes. Good luck and good to have the airbag light off. Beeped my horn unceremoniously for the next few days. Ha!
B00JRYH50I|5|Love these things. Bright enough for what i need and wiring could not be any simpler
B007V2DSIG|4|fit like a glove
B0058TF7EM|4|Perfect to keep things secured
B00E0IKFHG|4|Worked fine...Master link not included
B00JBIA70K|5|Great lights
B007CPLF0U|5|Pleasantly surprised with the quality of this unit. Time will tell, but It actually seems superior to the OEM assembly. The unit I received has metal locating pins vice the OEM's plastic. The vehicle's bulb harness attached securely and overall fit was every bit as good as OEM.
B00CUREA5C|5|First time using this towel, I was able to dry two vehicles (a mid sized sedan and a truck) back to back without wringing it out. It has a very large capacity. Also, it takes up water quickly with almost full absorption per swipe. This means I did not have to continually chase down streaks like I have with other towels. So far, I am impressed. The real test will be how it functions after a few washing and re-use cycles. If it stays as impressive a few months from now as it does out of the packaging, then I am buying more for myself and others as gifts.<br /><br />By the way, I used this towel with one of the popular &#34;no-rinse&#34; car washing products sold on Amazon, and it seems to be a killer combination.
B00N77WSDA|5|killed me to drill into my fender but works great to hold up one of the heaviest plastic bumper covers ive come across ( Caliber SRT4) and they look sleek and you don't even notice them.. unless you're wanting to be JDM hellaflush awesome sauce, then, you notice them
B00590TS2W|5|5 minute install. Fit perfect.
B002UD0GFE|5|Was recommended by the manufacturer of the lexan motorcycle cowling I recently purchased.  Works great, price is right. Highly recommend this speciality product over any household products for cleaning and polishing lexan or acrylic plastics.
B007FHEAFW|5|I love this lanyard!
B000WJX5I8|5|Perfect fit and function and looks great.  The stock pedal on my '97 Fat Boy was to close and to high.  this one moves it forward and low enough that it is easy to find the pedal and it's not in the way the rest of the time.
B00HHGSOHG|5|great buy, I installed one on my truck already with no issues at all and the quality seems great.
B0064OOMGO|1|Does not work for 2011 Toyota RAV4.  And, if you discover this after ordering...even if you have not even removed it from the packaging...you will be charged $35 fee for returning it to Amazing Keys.  Yeah, pretty Amazing.
B000C7TTCQ|1|Seemed like a good idea instead of cleaning the debris out of my old pan - which was rusting too.<br /><br />I am VERY careful not to over torque the drain hole and did it with my 3&#34; handle snap on ratchet - and I'm not exactly superman either. Certainly far less torque then what I used on my OEM pan.<br /><br />Had to get an oversized fill plug that may or may not hold out and ill have to drop the pan and weld in a bung...
B004S5NWTO|5|great product
B008WUCNVY|5|We purchased this as a Christmas gift... The Alabama fan loved it.
B00XIXD9EK|3|have to see how it lasts.  OEM 10 years.
B005NLQAHS|5|This is an excellent tool for the money and supplies way more information than my ELM 327 computer based OBD2 reader that I purchased just a few years ago.  There are no wires to get in my way and I can even get real time data while I am driving.  The affordable technology has come a long way in a short time.
B00CIMSGSG|5|perfect fit for my 2007 GMC Envoy . . .  lift effort is less than original supports .
B007I7D66S|4|Works
B00GUF74HQ|5|Very good
B007HG7SM8|2|Lasted  6 months and hose cracked. Luckily I  heard the leak before it wasted all the propane.
B00M9WUBBA|3|Screw one clips don't work well.
B004VAGKZE|1|Bought to replace solenoid box on winch, mounted under winch on trailer, out of the weather. Have to crawl under trailer and tap on it to make it work, EVERYTIME!! It even sticks in on position part of the time and have to pull wires off to make it quit.
B005ZHFXKU|5|Perfect detailed product..Thanks a lot!
B00A3UNYW8|5|Had one pressure monitor go bad and the place I had it replaced said to drive the car and the error message would go away. No way did that happen so I bought this item and it reset the car pressure display quickly.
B001DCJ40Q|5|These arrived promptly and installed easily.
B005O0QQ1S|5|It saved a lot of hassle that I have to undergo while securing my kid's belt over his seat.
B00M8TBOGU|3|guuud
B002EDRNBU|5|Hard to find in the states. I'm glad there were 8. Easy to loose
B0007XS06Q|5|Bought this item for my camper water heater which no longer would no longer stay lit. It was easy to install and now I have hot water in my camper again.
B002300ZLE|5|Fit right on my 1982 Honda CB900F Super Sport. Kinda heavy but so were my originals. They look nice. They stay put. Good price.
B00LIRVV2K|1|They are really cool looking lights but out of the box 2 led lights were out and about a week into using them they shorted out and quit working forcing me to switch back to the stock lights
B00E5OUOCQ|1|this is a big giant waste of money. flimsy piece of plastic that will not stay upright despite being held down by your car shades. there is no way to check sizing prior to buy. i thought the  jumbo would fit the honda crv but it does not seem to. further there are no instructions on how to twist it back into the small size to fit into the pouch. additionally the company asks you to contact them BEFORE you place a 1 or 2 or 3 star review. that is why the ratings are being skewed in a misrepresented way toward the positive. I am really disappointed in this product.
B006NIDQ9K|5|I 💘 it.
B00H5F2DJY|1|Absolutely terrible. Even at this cheap price not worth it. When these finally arrived, some had round white area on top of cap along with the red color rubbed off on many areas.
B00UHXE0VA|5|Love my LEDs.  I installed them on my C109RT
B00U16C94S|4|guuud
B00WW785XS|1|Foot pedal trim was very cheaply built also had no hardware to install them included. Plastic that was molded into them was coming loose as I opened package. Granted these things were inexpensive, but I was not even able to install them.
B00873J0YY|4|These bars are solid. Used with my kayaks without any issues. The did not tightened down snug on my round crossbars. Looks like they would be a better fit for a square bar. THEY Still WORK Fine though. not sure how the quick release scew knob works as you are suppose to put a nut on first and than put quick release. Defeats purpose if I have to cary a wrench to undo.
B00HX8ZNN6|5|I love my floor mats. They look great in my new car
B00CQBZ6X2|4|WORK GOOD
B00ISF59W8|3|I ordered the cover in black with black stitching to match the steering wheel.  Although it fits pretty well, there is no padding, so the armrest still isn't very comfortable.  Had I known this before buying, I probably wouldn't have even bothered.  The cover fits so tight, there isn't even enough room for me to glue in a thin sheet of foam.  Seems like a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />There is enough material that you can glue and/or staple the cover to the underside of the armrest, though you will have to pie-cut the corners.  Right now, I've got it just friction-fit, with the edges folded under.
B00CYS0Y0W|5|perfect choice..easy installation at auto shop.
B00L5R2MRG|5|Love it!
B00ZR51DSG|5|Not counterfeit. Work as expected. Taste is great.
B0009JB7GI|5|To out it simply, it just works. It can be sliced further without any issues. I use it on my sailboat to keep mobil and vhf devices charged. Extended it with the Road Pro 12' extender without any issues. Worth at least twice of the retail price, great value item!
B00DFCTORA|5|its exactly what you would expect. Good, well made belt. Easy to adjust. Came a day early and is must for any DBZ fan
B0006FKFMC|3|Item was shipped to me damaged to begin with. Not a great start. Box was fine that it shipped in. No excuses that the shipping company damaged it en route. Now that that's out the way.<br /><br />Product works pretty decent. All you really need is the part that you glue to the surface of the car and the wing nut. Glue the sticks to the car. Thread on the wing nut and then yank by hand.
B00VT1SHVI|4|Great light, great price, would buy again in a heartbeat.
B00WV52LRM|1|Did not fit 1996 Honda accord 2.7 engine model, it's 3 3/4&#34; short to wheel wells. This will only fit the 2.2L model. There website model and year tool said it would fit but it is wrong. They did approve RMA for return, but me as the buyer has to pay return postage/shipping. Not worth spending return shipping cost. I guess I lose and they walk with my money when ordering said it would fit. Not Right.
B00UXKNRAC|4|Good quality product, fits perfectly. Parking sensor mounts I would recommend re-glueing before installing, the current mounting glue doesn't hold up. Helps an ordinary A5 look more like an S5 or RS5!
B003E7LUQ4|4|Looks good,  instructions could be clearer, I don't like that there is a gap where water, snow or salt could sit in between cover and paint and create rust because the piece is not flush with the Jeep.<br />Looks good now,  but gonna keep a close eye on the water catcher I just created and possibly remove.
B008BZT9PS|1|Wrong size. DOES NOT FIT DO NOT BUY.
B00NY0S2OY|5|Best price I have found only time will tell how well it holds up to sun and rain in fla. seems to be well made would be great for inside winter storage<br />it colder weather areas
B00AQDNLX4|5|It  takes a while to sew ,the end product is awesome ,work of art in the right hands.
B001P29DIW|5|Nice quality product. Perfect fit and function for my 64 Corvair starter motor.
B001CEG90I|5|Fit my 2010 Corolla S, was just a bit smaller than my old filter.
B008IEVDXS|5|Great Quality, perfect fit for my 1997 Volvo 850 Wagon
B0012WHBSO|5|I love this air pump because of its price, power, and ease of use.  I have used it several times on my SUV, minivan, basketballs and bicycle tires.  Works great, and I highly recommend it!
B00DC8EIRS|4|kinda cheap, but works well
B005N6X9NG|5|I loved this shirt i will buy more
B007KPWE4I|5|good deal
B0131W4AGI|5|Good seller will make customer happy!
B007ZRJJ8U|1|Too cheaply made for the price of product. Returned.
B000CSEX7G|5|Wix , good filter , lots cheaper than buying it in napa or other dealers.
B00L237U98|5|The double vehicle hanger met my expectations to the highest my purse is safe and easy to reach.  I would recommend this product to my friends.
B00LU0UBH6|1|I had a California Duster for years and decided it was time to replace it.  I decided to try something new and so I bought this.  It didn't pick up the dust like my old duster.  You have to rinse it out often and it takes forever to dry.  I decided to just order another California Duster.  You never have to rinse it out and it cleans the car up so much quicker and better.
B00ZZ4ME5A|5|nice
B004AE0I0Y|5|Very nicely made, they even had protective film on them when they arrived, and all bulbs are included. Literal plug and play installation, great fit, and they look amazing. No complaints from me, I love them.
B008H3YIV4|5|Cart wouldnt charge correctly, lacked power, charge wouldnt last, and seemed like either battery was dying too soon, etc.  I installed a new solenoid to replace the 1982 solenoid, and suddenly cart got new life, batteries would charge longer, and last longer, easy to install!
B001H1I40O|5|Perfect fit.
B00K33XC8Q|4|The fit was very tight for my mustang. I had to modify my car to make it fit. The abs unit had to be moved back by three inches, which means drilling new holes in the frame of the car. I live in the desert and after all the hard work of getting it installed it works great!!!
B00BF1GR8M|3|took a few days longer than expected to receive it, for whatever reason I thought I was receiving more than one, but that's my own fault for not reading the description more slowly and clearly, I feel $7 is a lot to pay for a little sticker, I'm hoping a portion of the sale is going towards some sort of Law enforcement memorial fund or something...
B00C7XWIX0|5|Very good
B00842A7F4|5|works, good price.
B001810SHA|1|The product might in itself be perfectly usable refrigerant however I'll never know.  The delivery system was not able to deliver it into the cooling system even though I followed directions.  This seems to be a bad design.  After paying for this product I had to go to my mechanic and have them fill the system.  They told me it only had .8 pounds in after I used both cans on the car.  This product if flawed and worst thing is after you use it and find out it will not work, you can't get a refund.  Stay away from this item!
B007NGB3GY|5|Awesome!  Love the zipper over snaps!
B00IO0WS80|5|great replacement for OEM parts. Fits perfectly.
B00P2QAAG6|5|Just as described
B00FSRY7ZE|5|excellent product delivered on time.
B000CQPUQ6|5|perfect replacement for a 1968 Mustang 390. no issues at all.
B000C57WGS|1|Moog makes a great product, Took over two weeks to get here, refused shipment
B000Z0HVHA|5|as advertised  & works well
B000AP6REI|5|Almost same price of factory filter, plus reusable. I've used K&N filters for years.
B00IPS4APU|5|I'll keep my review simple : It did the job.
B00IS941D2|5|Looks awesome! Came with no dents or scratches
B000EDQR50|5|Simple...and they work!
B007Y34V3S|5|these are awesome same quality at others I found for 40 bucks each. I saved money by finding these and even if I lose one. id be happy to buy this set again and have an extra one.
B00D9C2CDO|5|This item saved us so much time and space. Excellent product that I would recomend to anyone!
B001DKT0DO|4|very helpful
B00QSNXSP2|5|Great product
B002JOVUO0|5|Easy to apply and super strong.  Used this to reattach a string of LED lights on a travel trailer.  Toughest part of the job was getting the old glue off the light strip.  This tape was so easy to apply, and the bond was instant.
B005U9JF5W|1|The sun ate the material, it fell apart and made a mess of my car. When i went to clean it up it was like chalk and smeared a grayish black...so mad when cleaning it.  DON&quot;T be a fool and purchase.
B00O5MVOYA|1|These things are absolute GARBAGE. They aren't real vinyl, and good luck to anyone who's unfortunate enough to buy these...
B00UA6G8R8|5|Best for the price.
B00CM26W7E|5|The gasket set was as advertised and worked perfectly.
B00MC65KOG|5|Great product wish i could have used the filter itself but ended up being bigger than i could fit. Tho rubber adopters came in handy without them i could not fit anything else on the intake tube.
B00QMWQJRS|4|Great product..thanks
B00KCHU0IS|3|as expected for the price this covers the old sneakers worn on wet grass.
B003YJPC2K|4|Worked just fine and eliminated the water leak I had when using a plastic model.
B004BCLBJM|5|Great purchase, I checked to see if I could tell the difference between the new and original bulbs, and I can't. I saved alot of money from this purchase.
B00C908EQ6|5|great product
B009OJ715U|5|Didn't make a huge difference from the old Bill's pipe I had but it's a slimmer design and won't hit my tire when landing. Deeper tone on my 05 RM 125. Would buy again if I had to replace
B00YYU6N2Q|5|Terrific!  I have driven thru 15 states so far, from Texas up to New Hampshire, and this bumper sticker has stood the road test!
B00BSEPX36|5|Great Price - Fast Ship - Matched Up Perfectly to the Originals - Installed easy - Gave them a 12 hr charge and my kid was zooming around on his scooter!!
B000B68C0S|5|Shipping was fast, perfect fit and works great.
B001BFO7DO|5|The part was on time and fit exactly like original
B000CGJYAE|5|Worked great.....gas gage accurate too
B000I1EEXA|4|First time using
B004R9DS04|5|Great windshield. Too bad I can't mount it to my bike. The 'universal' mounting kit won't fit any bike at the shop.
B006WOHML8|4|Nice quality
B003YKTNOM|5|Love them!! Easy install & fit perfect. leave my windows cracked & truck ventilated in this hot GA summer.
B00VNBDWPK|5|So far so good, I previously purchased another brand with the no fan copper cooling ribbon, but didn't like the beam pattern too much.<br /><br />The OPT 7 beam pattern is awesome compared to most other alternatives I have tried. I'm using them in a 2015 Nissan Rogue (X trail) that has standard reflector headlights and they work very well.<br /><br />guess time will tell, but so far very happy with them.<br /><br />The pic for the beam pattern in early morning, so there's natural light there but not a lot, but the beam still shows up well.<br /><br />**update 13 months on and still happy. One of the bulbs had one LED with a intermittent problem. I got in touch with customer support and they helped me diagnose the fault and they sent a new bulb straight away no fuss. Great customer support and nice to see them honor warranty with no fuss.
B003BZD03K|5|This 90 Degree elbow will give you a much tighter fit when connecting the water line. The plastic types have a tendency to leak. With the washers inserted properly, you will never have to worry about any leaks.<br />A no brainer to use brass for all of your connections.<br />RP
B00BCRMAAS|5|Fits perfectly and wears good. Was hard/pain to install but definitely worth it.
B00KBQEEGO|4|Recently, I purchased this stainless steel bumper guard from Steelcraft for a Mercedes ML-350, 2014.  The bar and installation kit was well packaged and of good craftsmanship.  No complaints about the quality. A few observations for the DIY installation process are in order. 1. Steelcraft has good fitters but they should employ better technical writers. The instructions are lame at best. I spent a lot of time trying to find the correct frame holes and positions listed in the instructions, and shown in crappy photos.  Steelcraft, you might try expanded drawings that include bolt positions. 2. Tools -- All the hardware is metric.  No complaints as this was installed on a Benz. But be aware, you will need metric end wrenches and sockets. And a box cutter, and either a Dremal Tool cutter, or a small angle grinder. 3. Do NOT unwrap the protective foam from the Sports Bar until the last step. Otherwise it can become scratched. 4. To my chagrin, the underside of a Mercedes M class has a plastic, fiberglass reinforced, splash guard that attaches to the front bumper and extends to the rear of the engine.  It is designed to the keep the engine compartment clean and does a good job.  Thankfully, it is in sections.  The installation instructions note the front section must be removed and there is a short mention that slots will be required.  This is a quite an understatement.  Slots of about 1.25” by 6 “ are required.  BECAREFUL NOT TO CUT THE SLOT ALL THE WAY TO THE EDGE OF THE PANEL! This stuff is pretty tuff and cannot be easily cut with a box cutter.  I resorted to a 4” angle grinder with a sanding disc.  As you do not want to make the slots too large so crap gets into the engine compartment, a lot of fitting is required.  Be patient! 5. The frame mounting brackets must be installed before you can begin cutting the slots. I bolted up the brackets and loosely fitted the Sports Bar in place to verify everything lined up. a. Tighten the brackets but not the bar, especially any bolts located inside of the splash guard, and remove the Sports Bar. b. Just place the splash guard over the brackets and mark with the box cutter, a line about ¼” ( 6 mm).  Remove to the work bench, and create a slot about 1.25” ( 32 mm) X 6” ( 150mm).  It may need to be bigger, these are approximate dimensions. c. This process may take several attempts and time consuming.  The objective is to get the splash guard back in place so all the screw holes line up and it does not bind against the new brackets. The splash guard uses 8mm hex head body screws. 6. Install the Sport Bar to the brackets and adjust for license plate and bumper clearance as needed. 7. Tighten all remaining bolts. 8. Remove the protective foam. 9. Wax, buff 10. Admire your handywork! 11. My elapsed time was just under 4 hours.  Also -- The lower tube covers the license plate.  The enclosed instructions mentions a license plate kit.  Unfortunately, I may need the kit to keep me straight with the law, but have yet to find a kit number or where to order it.  This kit should have been identified on Amazon.  Otherwise, it is a quality product.
B00843V6KI|5|Great quality helmet serves it's purpose. Haven't took a fall with it yet but I feel safe if I did
B00BJ56TVE|4|Works as intended. Could be built a little more sturdy. It's a plastic and not sure how it will hold up in the Maine winters. but locks the truck bed like we needed itt too
B0052FRMYK|5|Work great thanls
B00139YMUQ|5|Excellent
B00DBEMKF0|4|These  led bulbs are great
B001D20X4W|5|Fits great
B00AN93NB6|5|Easy to install and fits great. It looks good and is very functional. A real value for the money.
B00MWQ6MUW|5|Great LED for the money, recommended!
B00I5HRFYY|5|great
B00LWTT8MY|4|I'm sure this is a good product, but my lights have lots of contours and was not an easy task to do.  Great product, just not for my application.
B001L9KI56|5|While not true &#34;cruise control&#34;, this device provides simple relief to the dreaded right hand cramps.  Easily adjusted for ideal position, and you can change that position in seconds, without tools.  A very nice addition, especially for sport bikes that may not have cruise control or where cruise control cannot be added due to bar end configuration.
B00HDE3G52|5|looks good ,but no manual instrucctions i keep trying hows works
B004HCM9H4|5|Great, thanks A+
B0007OWD2M|5|I love this glass cleaner for my big patio windows. Nothing else I have tried does as good a job and leaves no streaks or residue behind. Will continue to purchase this product.
B000C45JG4|5|For the cost, it was better than expected and worked better thatn the original O.E.M. product.  If you need a MAF then these are the guys to go through.
B006ZCFKFW|5|Perfect! Looks amazing.
B00JA3BMDW|5|what a great tool.  everyone needs one
B003DNH4BO|3|Odered this for a 1991 Mazda Miata.  Way too big......
B00YC28OUU|4|For the price I think these are great.  No complaints about installation and they are an inexpensive way to have some support when getting in/out of the Jeep.
B0002UEOMS|5|A1
B00BGZ0KQC|5|I love these and this is my second one for my 2008 van.<br />My key remote had been dropped several times & come apart on my ceramic floors in Tx. My dealer gave me this as gift but after four yrs it had torn.<br />I LOVE  it as I can easily find my keys ( in my purse or backpack) and it keeps me from losing my battery if the remote does come apart ... It's very protective and we have 4 Hondas that are 2004-2011 and these are great to prevent remote wear & tear... Honda charges over $150 to rekey your vehicals .
B00L3LEEYS|5|Works great
B00CMGAOCY|5|Great item.
B00CIAS8WW|4|Alright
B0076M8TVM|4|When i received the packaged the top and the thing you press on to spray was apart. other than that its a 5 star
B004GCX744|4|Perfect fit.  The product was easy to install but did require painting as it was black although being white in the picture.
B003BYJW6U|2|It's pretty darn wide; certainly made for a full-size pickup bench seat, but slides around too easily. It will not work on the floor hump. THIS one, when I opened the storeage lid, it smelled like an ASHTRAY! Someone must have dumped their cigarette ashes into it. That smell hasn't gone away after many months!
B005K8E9FY|5|Good price, fast shipping
B009PQ7IFK|4|Fit wasn't perfect. With a little tweaking, and customizing works well.
B00L2CWRRO|5|Awesome- Thank
B00CTVN3DY|2|I bought this sunshade purely for the Minions.  It only lasted a few months, not even one whole summer.  The edges fall apart and &#34;shed&#34; little flakes of the black material everywhere.  It doesn't stay up on my windshield, falls down.
B00J622WMM|1|helmet fair, goggles terrible
B0048J70FW|5|Very satisfied.
B00DHVK7SO|4|comfortable
B006UL418A|1|poor quality materials. Flag is starting to peel off after just two weeks. Would not recommend  this product
B00KWGAHS2|5|Great Deal! - Quick Shipment from seller - Awesome prices esp. with gaskets included!<br /><br /> 2010 Hyundai Elantra - Perfect Fit
B003TU7L0U|1|Well, I grew up since my my initial review. Do yourself a favor and make sure you get real sound deadening tiles like CCD. After a few years, the FatMat has melted and made a mess.<br /><br />The most important reason to buy some real sound deadener is that the stuff doesn't work. At least it doesn't work nearly as well as other products. I noticed a huge difference in what I replaced it with. The other product much better dampened the sound and I used a whole lot less of it to achieve that effect. What I could get off of FatMat (what hadn't melted and darn near bonded with my panels like they were one) I did. Look into mass density vinyl with a insulating layer of closed cell foam as well. That helped quite a bit as well.
B00S0NCU5C|1|This starter only lasted a lil over month and needs to be replaced again. Save your money and buy a oem starter. I guess u get what u pay for.
B004RNR9QY|5|Very pleased.. Excellent product and price
B004W901CC|4|Need some bodywork to fit.
B00BMPFI6I|5|At least one year later, I'm happy with this tank. Hasn't leaked, fits under most low profile vehicles. Bought it for a Challenger with optional Track suspension so I could eliminate driving up on blocks first. Also works on a lowered Miata. Best compromise I found between height and lifting power.<br /><br />I might have bought the longer version of this if I was to do it all over again.
B001EOV45G|5|Works well, great fit.
B00H7LPKKU|5|It clamps on and holds pressure while the grease slow goes in. it's a little big for getting into tight areas, but it works most of the time. Nice to have a hand free to run the grease gun.
B00QK5QRBA|5|B
B00ZQ32VVC|5|just what i expected
B00QMUGMLI|2|I generally liked the helmet quite a bit.  The comfort has been good and I don't feel that concerned about scratching it up.  What pisses me off is the Hi Viz yellow sticker has faded after only two months.  Clearly the sun has done a job on it.  The main reason that I was originally attracted to this helmet was for Hi Viz yellow detailing.  So this is disappointing.
B004ROMJIQ|5|too easy to be stoled
B0090JVTYI|5|Work out fine, fit perfect. Been using it ever since! !
B000VUA1KI|5|shipped fast, product was as described.
B005D8NDNA|5|I bought one to fix my 99 Honda Recon and it works great! It was my first starter repair and couldn't of been easier. Then my father-in-law needed to fix his 01 Honda Recon, so I bought another one...
B008HIT9H2|5|Perfect. Just as I expected. I needed a label for my first aid cabinet and this was just the thing.
B009TC9PG0|5|took two try's but this stuff did expand and seal the O-rings that were leaking in my compressor. And it has held all summer long. This product is awesome !!!
B007GBFUI8|4|Really like this helmet.  Only thing that would make it better would be build in Bluetooth.
B009WEXOX0|5|Quick shipment and a very easy install.  There was plenty of room for my #13 shoes between the floor board and the shift peg.
B00F9RNIPI|5|good buy
B001A1M1J6|1|Wrong one didn't fit and don't know how to return it
B000R3SMMS|5|Good Value for the money
B00UIDOO9W|5|A great car product!
B000JFL8RK|5|GOOD JOB  GREAT PRICE AND SHIPPING  THANKS
B004B68XGC|4|The kit is complete enough to perform the intended job.  It does take quite a while to inflate tires starting at 70psi and increasing to just 80 psi.<br />And the little bugger does get quite hot.  It was still warm to the touch an hour later.  I was uncomfortable putting it back in the carrying bag until 30 minutes after using it otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B003VDFNV4|1|it said it would fit my 98 firebird and it didnt the connections arent the same
B00I5HRG02|5|great
B0002NIHFA|1|Supose to be red and it was black.
B003XRZIA4|1|Amazon is afraid to post my review, it would hault further sales by this evil Carleton. All it does is make money for them. It will cost you plenty.
B00020CB2S|4|This Dynamat is really top quality, it is expensive but it does good for reducing noise and heat while remaining somewhat lightweight.<br />I installed this overhead in my Jeep Cherokee and already I have noticed a more solid feel with the roof and reduced heat. In the driver and passenger door this stuff works great, keeping the speakers from vibrating the doors and making a solid door slam when shut.
B00JIIZCM6|5|Awesome product
B000FOIJXQ|1|Horrible.  It washes off in the rain, now it looks terrible and blotchy.  I applied it to the plastic under-body trim on my G35 Sedan and followed the instructions perfectly.  That didn't matter, it's a horrendous product.  Save your money DO NOT BUY!!!!
B00KUL790S|4|Easy install less than 10 minutes, seems to be performing well.
B00KH84KFQ|4|worked well with 2008 ford escape
B000WJX222|5|Works great! Fast shipping.
B000EIDRD0|5|Easy to use works great!
B0084UIMEO|5|Well made, exact fit
B00ANZHG4U|5|I am a believer! Best microfiber cloths for the price!
B001GRMX06|4|Good fit
B0057WTATS|5|Fits like it was made just for a Tracker
B008539UTG|5|I am sooo happy with this product.  It took absolutely seconds to put on.  It makes my baby .. my 2014 Camaro LS .. look beautiful.  Thank you  thank you  thank you😀😂😁
B000COCRJ6|5|The cable was better than original will buy again
B0041MEAUO|5|Replaced both rear wheel bearings on my 2006 VW Beetle and these fit perfectly.  Very happy with these.
B002QCUO9M|5|I have been using flash for years.  It is the very best item you can use to keep your car or truck looking like it just came off the showroom floor.  I love it.
B001KS8NWI|4|It is very difficult to get the thicker UPF48R at an auto supply house and it is required for my Z06 due to the slightly higher oil pressures and flows than other cars using the PF48.  Great price, quick delivery so why not get the proper Oil Filter.  I had an excellent dealership change my oil for the first oil change and they used the PF48, so it works, but if Chevrolet says use the UPF48R, at this price why not use it?
B00KWQRC4O|5|it is perfect!
B00F5LWJBC|5|So easy to use
B00OH0S5Y2|2|These are okay at best...thank god you get a bag...just like my review for the red ones you just keep plugging them in until you find one that fully works. Most the end lights up...but not the surrounding lights.
B0085L65RI|5|It was a great product at a great price
B001O4CIHY|5|Amazingly simple, works exactly as described. Holds my 2014 HD Ultra Limited up like starched underwear.
B00Y1HSZV4|3|They are great. And easy to use. ....
B000ET8D0G|5|I've used various string plugs, SLIME is in my experience the best!  Gooey right out of the packaging film. Better still when activated with tire/rubber cement.
B00GZ20Z3E|5|The best
B001V8LQ2G|5|GREAT FOR CAMPING
B00Y1HUOHW|1|No Comment necessary!
B003ZWKCVW|5|Top notch materials and construction!
B008Q9X4EQ|3|Nothing to say good product
B00EQMFES6|4|Worked perfect and no more noise,
B0009ZEVL0|5|Great product great price wonderful seller, Thanks
B00A7WIVNE|5|This fit and worked like a dream!  Had no issues cutting out the switch inserts and install was very direct and easy.  Read a lot of reviews and watched a lot of YouTube videos related to this product and biggest complaints were that you had to use an existing clamp from the back plate on the cargo door and one video were the owner obviously installed wrong or ordered the wrong part and tries to MAKE it fit.  I would highly recommend this item to anyone installing lighting switches.  Looks great and prevents any drilling into your dash area.
B005QVZREM|1|Probably a counterfeit part.  This one didn't have the threaded holes for the motor screws so you have to get (3) 10mm nuts.
B001NZVLEA|5|After replacing my bad pump with autozone pumps twice and still heard noises when i steered, I decided to get an OEM type and it actually worked! I was very happy with my purchase
B001KS6FPA|5|works great and has held up well
B00KTIVQEW|5|GOOD
B00C59RT30|1|Absolutely worthless.  Ran for a few minutes and quit pumping.  Amazon should not be selling this garbage if they want to continue to have my business.
B005XUYDV4|5|Was getting a code meaning the C section of my coil pack was failing. It felt like the transmission was slipping and had me worried me since I pull my travel trailer with this truck. I replaced the coil with this one and it hasn't missed a lick since.
B007V2BH0C|5|the best product ever
B0082365AQ|5|Works great to let me move around my canoe by myself.  Great little product!!
B001EOYJSU|5|Pretty straight forward install. Only issue I had was I had to &#34;stretch&#34; it out to get it to fit. Where it mounts to the frame rails was half a bolt to short. Had the nuts on the other bolts so I pulled the other side while another set of hands lined it up and put on the nuts. Welds looked good. Simple install. Great product.
B007Y0ALLW|5|fits and looks great
B00TJSZ18U|5|Before buying this, I read tons of reviews that gave conflicting stories. But the truth is, this face shield surpasses anything else I've worn or used. It is equivalent to wearing sunglasses under your helmet or using a drop down sun shield as seen in scorpion Exo helmets.  For reference I wear Oakley polarized grey lenses in sunglasses, and the tint is almost identical at full dark on this shield.<br /><br />Now to be fair, this shield does NOT get as dark as shoei's darkest tinted visor, but it goes darker than the medium dark tint they have. It works very well with direct sunlight, and reduces glare which is the real issue with riding in the sun with no shades. It also keeps visibility at a maximum since sunglasses tend to limit visibility inside your helmet. I wouldn't recommend staring directly into the sun though, but no sunglasses manufacturer would tell you to do that either.<br /><br />This was an amazing investment in my opinion, and I'd absolutely recommend it to anybody looking for a tinted visor.<br /><br />I've attached a picture which shows the photochromic visor at about 80% activation compared to the original clear visor.
B00I2SRV1S|5|Great organizer good quality and looks awesome in car.
B0002SRIX2|4|This set is the best value in my opinion for terminal adapters for automotive diagnostics.  I find them especially useful for performing pin drag tests.  My only complaint is that I wish they would connect directly to my multimeter leads.  I may try to find some adapters so that I can do that.
B002QGVW3K|5|Works as listed
B00MOYJ9DE|5|They came quick I have had them for some time now I have had no problems I wired them directly to my battery and I can have them on and show them off in parking lots I get alot of compliments on them I am buying another set soon great product and easy installation too very bright at night
B00C90ZDGU|5|Beautiful - very stunning!
B00PKQGTLI|5|I've used this vinyl to wrap a stroller frame (not a car) with great success.  It's easy to work with and the guideline grid on the paper backing makes your cutting more accurate with a lot less effort than other brands.  My strollers look really nice and are also being protected from scrapes so I'm very happy.
B00KMKWUSS|4|Need to take to have them installed since I'm not able to do it myself (I knew this before I ordered) and even if I were able to install myself I don't read Chinese.  I think they will look great on my car.
B0002MBKDW|4|Did not fit my 2014 F150 but it did fit another vehicle
B00USCUZ0A|5|AAAA
B00OQPRPK8|5|my kids  and I love it .. it's very durable and looks cute too.  not flimsy looking at all.  I ordered two already...now my car doesn't have stuff all over the foot area as the kids have a place to put their things.  I used to have a small box next to their seat but that can fall over with a quick braking on the road or a sharp turn... I highly recommend this product.  We have two in our SUV!!
B00GI781BY|1|Nice packaging but the light is dim and the product is very flimsy.
B000IZ3FS6|5|Perfect fit for a 2004 Toyota Corolla. These fit models built in Japan, not North America. You do have to make sure you get the proper brakes depending on vin number of your car. My local parts stores did not have the correct ones even though they said what they sold me was correct. These were exact replacements and fit perfectly. They work great and are 100% quiet. You just need to make sure you grease the rear plate contact points where the brakes rest to avoid them squeaking at stops. Anybody should know that. So far so good.
B00NY1XTR8|5|Great price, Great product
B000GZOLAE|5|fit as expected. great after market product
B00VN0FHNG|3|Cute, but disappointing. Smell only lasted a day
B002QFLQ78|5|Nice fit good weight.
B000COL53K|1|Good product for small car but did not fit my 90 silverado
B001F0MHV4|3|Perfect Fit.....
B00FSAV5LU|4|Good product. Would not use if there are lots of bug splatter on the car. Best to use as a quick was if you do light driving or car is not used often.
B0063CS8F8|5|It fit the car fine. I tried a vent visor that went inside the window channel and couldn't get all the windows to close so I switched to this one which sticks to the outside. I had used this brand before without any problem and expect to have the same luck with this one.
B00KM2POWA|2|Could not use them as interned dud pruduct for that but they might have a use elsewhere in my life.
B00DSO9JZW|4|It doesn't look much better than the stickers from the outside. But it functions just as described and it's easy to remove and/or adjust.
B00MIZT7OK|3|I bought this for my daughter without thoroughly reading to determine that it's plastic. I would have preferred metal.
B008G28KGK|2|I had to file the plastic on the main bulbs so that they would rotate into place-- took 45 min so I'm ok but... after I had the headlight installed-- the knobs used for adjusting the location of the light on the road did NOT work at all.  I got the &#34;dim&#34; to line up by bending the metal mounts but the &#34;High&#34; is way out and not really useable much.  The unit looks very good from the outside. Plan on spending a few extra hours.
B0048EBVI4|5|Fits like a glove!
B0045WBVUM|5|great product!!! Airhawk claims that using their pad will double your ride time. It's true! I love my Airhawk! It made for a very comfortable and enjoyable 3500 mile ride.
B00SLKCZGS|5|Looking for a inexpensive AC replacement that works?  Look no further.  Shop wanted $1,400 to do the job.  I bought this one, put it on, then just paid to have it charged for $100.  Remember to reset the computer or the new. Compressor Will not turn on.  Also remember to add PAG oil...  I saved $1,000 doing it myself.  Hello....  I have bought many car parts from Amazon and saved.  Shipped in 2 days.
B00GWWTUV0|5|very happy and easy install. :)
B00B29UGMU|5|So far I liked the product. I recommend this to everyone.
B007D7QO3A|5|Lift supports arrived promptly and installed easily. They function better than new.
B00ON8WFBM|5|Exactly as I wanted. Sticker quality is great!!!
B00AVLU3ZK|5|great job
B007BH63D8|5|These things last forever.
B00YB5GAEA|5|Another rider passed me on the bike trail with one of that was turned on.  I was impressed by the intensity even during daylight hours.  Since most of my riding is in the evening hours, I had to try one and am pleased by how well it stands out and marks my location on the rural roads of Illinois.<br />Don
B00ZS9RWZE|5|Trump 2016 Go for it Mr Trump
B0013916XW|5|Should come standard. Easy install - look great! I have had these on for 8 months through a Chicago winter and a Chicago summer. My Jeep spends its time outside. These guards have not wavered.
B00IUUHH26|5|Solved my problem, looks like new.
B009OBP55G|5|just what I needed
B000CQ264A|5|red grease
B0012UJXX2|1|Misleading information or wrong product?  I remember looking at AEM filters a few years back and they were grey elements.  I figured maybe they just changed up their style so I went ahead and bought it anyway.  This filter has AEM molded on the end cap, but has a K&N logo on the seam, and it came pretty thoroughly drenched in oil residue.  AFAIK, this is not a &#34;Dry&#34; filter but a rebranded, slapped-together abortion of a product that was once good.
B0070Y363C|1|Broken and several lights don't work not to much of a product review maybe on the shipping side can't tell if it's a good product or not don't work out the box
B00ONDM4O0|5|holds my phone. thin holder broke after 6 months
B00002N57X|5|Motor arrived day promised and was installed immediately. Works perfectly and more than satisfied with service. Thank you
B00EQMEHS4|5|great deal
B000SL4AA2|2|Unfortunately this unit has more con's than pro's:<br /><br />Cons:<br />* The pressure gauge on my unit is very far off: I did a calibration of this unit with two other pressure gauges, and while the two other units agree on 32 psi, the AAA unit shows around 40 psi.<br />* In addition this unit is not very well suited for car tires: Usually car manufacturers give you an exact number to which to inflate you car tires, usually somewhere between 28 and 35 psi. However, the pressure gauge only has markings in 5 psi steps --- you will never be able to exactly inflate it to the manufacturer suggested value...<br />* The sealing rubber in the normal tire valve already shows signs of wear after just testing it with all my 4 tires twice. This leaves the question open how long it will last...<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Compact design which allows to store the cords<br />* The compressor seems to do what it says<br />* Inexpensive<br /><br />Verdict:<br />This is not a tool to regularly check your tire pressure with, it is just for emergencies...
B001C6EGZG|5|Good price and fast shipping.
B000HBM86Q|5|A1
B00GWF39RS|1|I have tried using 4 of the 8 that I have received and so far, all 4 have started flickering shortly after installation. Very cheaply made and doesn't last. Will be returning.
B00GP4JWDG|5|Worked very well on Equinox about30-45 min per side!! We are just backyard shade tree mechanics!!!
B00BWTW40W|5|Love how they look on my Jeep Wrangler 2015, fit like a glove, as if they were factory!  We have a gravel drive and it has help tremendously with rocks being kicked up and chipping my painted fenders.  Wished I would have found these sooner, I would have put them on as soon as possible.  And as to difficulty of installation, yes you will need to remove rear tires to install but it only took my husband and I about 30 minutes to install all four.  You will need a drill, drill bits, and screw drivers or phillips bit for your drill.  If you can change a tire you can do this, otherwise take them to a tire place and they should be able to install them for you (for a price).
B00TENR5RU|1|All advertising pictures show steps included received product and no steps. As far as I'm concerned show one thing ship something else bait and switch
B0006301W8|5|Works great with the Gila film.
B002GO784Y|5|Easy to install.  Works great!
B002935IV2|5|Worked excellently for our trip from Missouri to New Jersey underneath a RoofBag we bought.The bag hardly moved and I feel sure it would have done without this.<br /><br />It is just a big piece of material, similar to a yoga mat, but the size is just right and makes it easy to use with the RoofBag.<br /><br />Worth the money.
B001GC2LVM|5|Easy to use to level your rig! Up to 4&#34; of rise and set the chock to set the level.
B008XB9BJY|5|I've tried many others that burnt out and let me down. These are the only ones that have NOT given me any issues and have kept cool and kept working. Very please with them. I'll buy some extras as back up.
B002M2X1XM|1|Worthless
B0006JLSNI|1|Delivered Jun 25, 2015 and already it's leaking at the hose end fitting.  Unbelievable!<br /><br />&#34;Warranty, Parts: Limited 1 Year Warranty&#34;<br /><br />What am I supposed to do?  Ship it somewhere?
B00230OYGQ|5|It is what it is.
B008JORKP2|5|First night out and completely impressed. Have seen a lot of other gas puts that struggle to make a good flame. This one is money. Even on low it produces a nice flame. Kids loved roasting marshmallows.
B0040I4EIM|5|ok
B000JQEML8|5|Got these to match the rear of my truck...catch everything as advertised...keep the carpet clean and give it that custom look
B004A6MBP2|5|OEM exact match for my 1998 chevy cheyenne.
B000C2WF0E|5|Excellent ...
B00S71XABA|5|Excellent
B001G4TV6S|2|Too small
B001PWA0IO|5|So far so good, had it on about 2 months now. Some people had problems installing or following directions, but to me they were clear and it works great!<br />2014 XLT F150
B000GD5FMY|4|good deal
B00065L2D8|5|worked good
B00AC7VJCO|1|Absolute garbage.  It seized up on the first use that it took 2 hours to cut off.  AVOID at all costs.
B00SO1YXY6|3|Bigger than I thought- works well. Thanks!
B001483LO4|2|The intake tube felt fairly low quality and the rubber adapter pieces were not cut very well... rough edges and not straight. All in all, it looked like something that should sell for half the price. Returned it immediately.
B00U3GO36S|5|Look great
B000IG20RW|5|GOOD DEAL
B000E2CVI8|5|Best filter out there.
B001DHE38E|5|I'm feeling cool now !
B00I53ZNYM|4|Fit great and look great.  Highly recommend for long on-road use.
B00JA5Q50U|4|These are great quality seat covers and fit the seats my Nissan Rogue very well. Installation was reasonably easy once I figured out how. My only complaint is that they come with no instructions and their Amazon page does not as well. I found instructions on YouTube and I recommend viewing those before installing. Install time for both front and back seats would probably have been less than an hour if I had viewed the instructions first.
B00NV6C73I|5|These are great! All pieces are easy to install and they really brighten up the interior of my G37S. Total time to install including laying everything out and making a plan was about 40 minutes.
B00OZEPAU2|5|I ordered two of these and am very happy with them.  The lettering is beautiful and the plastic is durable.  Wish people would read the full item description before criticizing.  I received exactly what I expected and do not feel that it looks cheap.
B007OW62V8|5|I tried another brand and it caused a loud roaring sound when the fan was above medium speed. I switched to a genuine part and no more issues
B00HFEECAS|5|Great product.
B00A82ERWW|5|Works better than the original!
B000BVRZ74|4|works well, wish it didn't wear off so soon though
B001GF2SXU|4|First, I have to address the ordering/shipping of this product.  I ordered the product (Prime - which meant 2-day shipping), but upon order, they pushed my shipping date out about a month.  I thought about it for a day or 2, then made an attempt to cancel my order.  Well, they refused my cancellation by basically changing the status of the item to &#34;preparing for shipping&#34;.  I waited a couple of more days and made another attempt to cancel.  That day, my item was shipped.  I was so irritated by this that I didn't even open the item for 2 1/2 weeks.  Finally put it to use, and I will say it is a solid product.  The fit is decent (one user described it as tight, but I wouldn't go that far), and the quality is very evident.  Unlike shades I have used in the past, this one is sturdy and foldable only (no rolling this one up).  It is thick with a felt/carpet-like back, and seems very durable.  Overall, I would say good job Covercraft.
B000CD38BS|5|Monroe Reflex at $35 each delivered in 2 days, whats not to like? Thankyou Amazon, fitted my 99 Dodge Dakota perfectly, and improved handling for sure. Highly recommended.
B000BQWW7M|4|This helped to reduce the fogging of my car windshield and eyewear.  It is also especially useful for removing fingerprints from tablet screens.  I would recommend this product for those purposes.
B00080QGYG|2|once this adaptor is mounted on the floor jack it is really high and difficult to use. In order to use you have to jack up the car to about 2 ft. I ended up using just the floor jack.
B009CYGBHG|2|ridiculously hard to fit on and they wont even stay ....very cheap metal
B0066TMFIY|5|Exc1
B002RSIK4G|5|This is a great product that every RVR should have on hand. I outlined the roof edges of my RV where cracks were showing and it did the trick. Where I only needed 2 inch wide strip, this was easy to slice with a razor knife. Used this also to patch a hole where a branch tore the roof.  Don't use over silicone it won't stick. I removed silicone with acetone first. Going to buy more to have on hand.
B00JHN1W7G|5|This is for the wife's car. I love mine in my truck. I've had it in for over a year.
B000O5DUP8|5|Added it to my bike rack.  High quality product.
B00OUTE9CW|5|Worked well and good quality
B001GCRWCK|4|Nice boots
B0081T3PP4|5|Good stuff, put in an 87 Honda CRX that had R12 and it's nice and cool in the summer heat in Texas.
B00REXL1DQ|4|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B002304Q3M|5|This ignition switch was exactly what I was looking for. I'm rebuilding an old Honda CB750 and I needed an ignition switch that had two separate circuits so that power going to certain lights and components is properly fused (I bought a different 3-wire ignition switch initially, and in the run position all three wires had continuity which would bypass my fuse box if I used it).<br />This Emgo switch has the exact configuration I was looking for. The operation of the switch feels nice and smooth and when the key is in either of the two positions, it cannot be extracted. Perfect!
B009XQKCQY|5|just plugged the clips direct to the batteries and presto, a perfect solution to guessing the voltage amount in the rv.
B003E8A95G|5|My daughter added her own sparkly crystals to the hearts. She's very happy with the plate.
B002OQ1ZHA|4|Adequately detailed- just like most Clymer products
B00A3V3DLY|5|oem type fit fixed  mu rear brake problem, great value
B003STX368|5|I am a life long Cardinal fan with the Birds on the Bat prominently displayed on my front door.  When I decided I needed a new door mat on which to wipe my feet at the front door, I started shopping for a Chicago Cubs door mat.  What better than a Cubs mat to serve this purpose.  Cub fans please understand that this was done in fun as I love the rivalry that exists between the Cubs and Cards.  My mail carrier is a Cubs fan so my mat got pretty quick attention.  (Funny thing is, the only mail I'm getting lately are the bills.)<br /><br />Now on to the mat itself.  I like the quality of the mat.  The material is heavy and the emblem clearly printed and well secured.  I would purchase this mat again as I consider it to be of good quality for the price.  My wife says I have gotten much better about wiping my feet before entering the house so this mat has made her happy.  When she is happy, I am happy.  Go Cards!
B00682RIAY|3|I saw several glowing reviews on this product but my experiance is that the tolerences are to close I cant get the bits into the holder so not happy with this dont know if the previous reviews were tillted but I would buy the other comperable set if i had it to do over. The steel quality is good as others have said but if it doest fit it doesnt work???
B00429NKWK|5|did a great job on two vehicles, make sure to use water with the send paper, I saved the uv protection bottle and used it on a new car lights so I won't have to use a kit in a future
B005E39NS8|5|Great price. Had key cut for $4.50 and it works great.
B00J8W9UAW|1|These did not fit my early 77 FJ40
B000COMXA4|5|Great, one piece, high quality, American made lug nuts.
B003F7RJY0|5|Fit perfect
B00QTGGZUI|5|Worked great for a 1990 honda trx300
B008MMOQKS|5|AAA
B000KKLLFS|5|Fit as expected
B000UKHHQ0|5|I added this shifter when I installed the IMS Pro footpegs to my '08 KLR 650. Seems nicely made, an easy swap, and gives some more room for my big feet. This shifter does have a little more throw, but I've gotten used to that. Since this is longer than the OEM one, it sticks out farther sideways, and doesn't fit into the stock shifter recess in the alternator cover. There is about a 1/4&#34; clearance between the inside of the shifter and the cover now, something that might be a concern if you crash on the left side. So far its worked well for me.
B001KSGF14|5|So happy about being able to use signal again
B0023042N6|5|I purchased this fender to update the looks of my sons 2007 KX100.  The fit and finish is really nice and the plastic is thick and good quality.  He has laid the bike down a few times and it has held up perfectly.
B00EPDL25K|5|Just awesome. My old truck has some dirty seats so I washed the seats, let them dry and put these over them. Brilliant. MFFL.
B00PT18QAQ|5|It was a gift for my Sons' Birthday and he just thinks it is great.  He has a pickup truck and likes to check his tire air pressure at least every other week.  He said that it was very accurate and he enjoys the rubber around the case.  It is good protection for the gauge.  He was very pleased with it.
B00IS9427W|4|This works well.  The lights are bright and comes with a wiring harness.  The holes matched up on my 2014 JKU.<br />They shipped well and had all sorts of bubble wrap and plastic to cut through.<br /><br />It would have been 5 stars except there are no instructions for anything and my winch hole was slightly bent.  You receive a box full of screws so you have to figure it out.  It's easy as there are just a couple bolts but I'm not an electrician and the wiring was a bit tricky.  They give you different connections for the outside lights versus the inside lights.
B002XM51CA|3|One week long trip and they are already taking a beating... They look nice and keep the coach cleaner, but I am sure they won't last.
B000JFL8HK|4|Worked perfectly and was shipped very promptly.
B0064F94Q6|5|Good quality
B000E28CK4|5|great
B001NZM6QC|5|Perfect fitment. Works well. Looks just like OEM
B00009AOCF|4|Arrived on time. Great product.
B00NXENJNU|1|This small for car
B0006IX850|5|Does what it is suppose to
B00HFWYZO8|2|the front mats don't cover the entire area of my toyota sienna le, 2014.  the description implies that it would fit.
B00P5YMQOY|5|Nice
B00NRVCOZS|5|Holy crap they're bright as hell.
B002IG1WJC|5|Took a 70 year old 15 minutes to install
B007772HG4|5|wow ! it works !!!!!
B000BRGAJ2|5|Truck runs cooler
B00GIP6GRW|5|This is was my third order of the Jeep embellum - the previous orders came with white backing tape which is noticable on the vehicle. One previous orders stated it was a Mopar part which it was not. This was delivered in Mopar packaging, with a Mopar label. The product looks great-gives the grill an extra pop. It is a semi gloss finish, very easy to put on and line up.
B001TIAYXU|4|Nice quality piece as expected for the money, but it would be nice if it came with screws for mounting...
B000LC87V6|5|Worked as expected
B004VY6M3A|5|friends in the car - noticed the really attractive trash bag.  they liked both the  design and the interior  case that keep the shape and allows it to be  squashed too --
B006MIRL9C|5|This spare tire cover looks great, fit perfectly & is just what I wanted!
B006QH6XQG|4|Does not fit well in 2009-2012 f150 battery tray. Little small need to wedge something to keep it in place
B0031OXGXU|5|It fit and seems to be staying in place.
B0038N8706|4|IT TOOK A BIT OF WORK TO MAKE THEM FIT
B005N9EKUY|3|I should have been more careful in determining the size I needed.  It was pretty small, but I'm using it any way.
B00BVB8CGG|5|Great part works very well, recommend to everyone who needs a master window switch can't beet the quality for the price
B006E0OY6G|5|fit perfect. I've been in and out of the valve cover three times since I installed the seals. No leaks or problems
B009AQS5H0|5|These plates look great.  I have them on my Genesis Coupe and bought them for a friend that admired them.
B0019I57XC|5|They just work. Had to check calibration though...
B0073MF67K|5|Fast delivery... beat their estimate by days! Exact replacement part, perfect fit, and excellent value. Will order from Shepherd again, and soon.
B001449KPM|5|excellent specialty accessory
B000JZ33H8|5|Worked great to eliminate &#34;hyper flash&#34; when I installed LEDs. Vehicle: 1992 Chrysler Lebaron
B00NEL7NY8|5|It's K&N, can write anything better
B009PW58E2|5|Exactly as promised.
B00APOFQYQ|5|Vison fit perfectly, easy to install!
B00KIERDDU|5|Very Bright!
B00BYH6C1E|5|Got them on time. I am very happy
B000BZG72E|5|Xlnt. Perfect fit.
B00PQ48QTW|1|Sticker arrived today somewhat dried out and would not stick. Waiting to hear back for a refund or replacement.
B005KFKWNA|5|Nice wheel love the suede and the 12 o'clock line helps keeps a visual reference when driving hard.
B001GC856W|5|great
B000DCNGII|5|Excellent way to install a temperature sensor or cooling fan switch in a 5/8&#34; heater hose line. I decided this was a cleaner, more compact installation than those aluminum adapters that require you to cut the upper or lower radiator hose. Thread is 3/8&#34; NPT. I'm using this with a NAPA FS118 temperature switch and a relay to control the high-speed stage of the radiator cooling fan on our Ford SHO.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Great kit, well made and instructions were easy to understand with pictures showing every step. Not sure why they want you to remove rear tow hook so I did not. I took a 18mm open end wrench and taped the nut to it so it wouldn't move. Then was able to place the wrench holding the nut into the tight space so i was able to start each bolt to nut. this will make sense when you are looking at it. Its a very tight space between rebar and bumper.
B00433SIQI|5|made install easy
B008KPPE76|1|Not worth your money..... Garbage not even bright!!!
B00SXBA97M|4|Works great, so far. Used it on a couple of rides. Clamp and mounting plate are metal, unit housing is plastic. Appears to be good quality. Time will tell.
B00BXLE1GO|5|Worked great.
B001TJ9IFO|5|I must admit I was skeptical that any product could make the bed liner look good on my newly acquired 2012 Tacoma. It was pretty bad with scrapes, gouges and scuff marks. I am pleasantly surprised and very happy how well this product worked. It eliminated all the white marks from scrapes and scuff marks. After two coats it looks like new. I highly recommend this product to recondition your bed liner. Another plus is I still have half a bottle left!
B003UT3S6Q|5|Very happy with the product and with the results!!!
B00AR5P01W|4|Good fit
B00JHWVPQA|1|Picture and product are different
B00EBV3S4O|5|Ok
B000C11JSE|5|They work faster than the originals. One screw hole didn't line up, so I only put two screws in there. Works great.
B000CQ03AE|4|Good for the money
B001V8U12M|5|worked for me
B00HLW18T2|5|Excelent
B001FAI9KC|4|I actually fabbed up some brackets so this could be used on a 2008 Jeep Liberty, so I can't comment on fitment, but the texture and quality was excellent. I gave it 4 stars only because of the front bolt holes were hard to get bolts in because of the angle. Other than that, I love it.
B0049IWMRI|4|It was a little hard to put together only because the one side was a bit warped. I had to really tighten the bolts to get the steel to straighten out in order to get it together. Other than that, works perfectly for what I need. It says it holds 500lbs, but I bent it a little standing on the edge of it (I'm 180lbs). Perhaps if the load was distributed over the whole carrier more, it wouldn't have bent. I'm still not sure about putting a full 500lbs on this carrier, but you can't beat it for the price. It is a little sloppy in my 2&#34; receiver and cluncked and banged every time I went over a bump until I bought a hitch tightener. Now it's silent.  I used it to carry two coolers to the Outer Banks, NC (a 7hr trip one way) and back no problems.
B00480J4KA|4|Bright clear light.
B00KTICEZ2|5|great product with glow in the dark feature.
B0024ECCJW|3|wires were all wrong. had to make all new . no help line
B001U04NCA|5|Working well.
B004BYX8W8|5|Simply freaking amazzzzzing! I saved lots of mulah doing this myself and its running again! Thanks amazon
B007VWYCH2|5|wanted you to know that three brake fluids were checked for how good it was and Mag1 tested the best!!!!
B00HSZQVT4|5|Bought this mats for my daughters Fiat 500L. Fits perfectly and is good for all weather.
B000O846UI|5|Just what I needed.
B003G9SDOW|4|great looks good.
B000SOIRCG|5|Flow goes through this funnel expediently from 1 thru 5 gallon gasoline containers into my Snapper rear engine rider mower.
B004QEM6HQ|5|It PULLS the LOAD,  hauled over 5000, no problems
B00EA2VNMI|5|Plastic but still cute. I thought you order one color but in fact they send you the silver/black as well as the red/black.
B0002KKIVO|5|The only thing I will use here in AZ.
B000VD2K72|4|👍
B00EUUNJRM|4|Good bright light bar for the money. I just mounted it on my rock crawler today. It had one scuff and dent on the front from shipping but that didn't really bother me much. Make sure you don't over tighten bolts going from the braket into the lightbar as the housing is aluminum. I pulled most of the threads out of where the bracket attaches to the light. I used Loctite Red and hopefully it will hold. It has a buzzing sound when it is turned on but seems to work good so far. It only comes with about 2.5-3' of cord, 2 brackets and 4 socket head screws for mounting. I had to modify the brackets for bigger bolts for my application. I had to buy a switch, relay, wire, and a fuse block which cost $35 at Advance Auto. Hopefully it will last.
B00OYEKX5K|2|It quit on me after 3 months.
B00JH6KDY6|5|Very cool and
B000WNZ50A|4|The style is kinda plain, but it's the only thing out there. It works and will likely last for decades. It's not what's shown in the picture.
B004RCQTIY|5|Whenever changing a fuel pump make sure the filter is changed at the same time, especially if they are in line, as was in this case.  Make sure you clamp off the fuel line coming from the fuel tank going into the fuel filer or else you will loose a lot of fuel.  I used a pair of vice grips to pinch the fuel line about four inches from the filter.  Once I had the fuel line off I inserted a small wire cap into the end of the line as an extra precaution.  Very easy to install the fuel filter with the new fuel pump I also bought.  The price was less than what the dealership was offering for the same unit.
B00L3FNG34|1|This is a piece of junk! There is a blob of rubber protruding under the PROGRIP. Poorly manufactured and carbon fiber look is inferior. Maybe I got a bad example. Not worth returning internationally!
B00PGM0V7E|5|I am slowly converting over to leds on my motorcycle.  I have already installed one set of generic leds from local auto store and they were not very bright and broke apart trying to put them in(had to go back to regular bulbs). I got a set of JDM PX white 1157 in front turn signals to see if they were any good and they are super bright . I put the1156 yellow in the rear turn signals and they are super bright too. If you want to be seen on the road these bulbs are excellent. (if you have a single turn signal bulb on the dash, you will need to cut/rewire or put diodes in.)
B0028090SS|5|Great exactly what I expected
B0024NWRLQ|5|awesome
B0000AZ8JB|5|Love this mirror. Works great in the back of my truck to see my baby. So much more durable than typical baby mirrors!
B000GU3KHO|2|It only lasted a little over 9 months. I don't know if this is normal but I will buy something better next time. Live and learn they say, trying to save a few dollars always end up spending double the money. Will not recommend this to anybody.
B00LBHCZYK|5|nice fit n finish
B009WDX1NE|5|I love this thing it is large but hold my large metal coffee cup with lid with ease.
B00TANNOYC|5|This is a great product and the base and metallic top coats went on easy and worked great. I super-cleaned the wheels first, removed any loose paint, protected the rotors and pads behind the wheels, and painted. 4 coats of base, 4 coats of top. Looks stunning, like very expensive wheels.  I have had this on for 2+ months now and will update this as the year goes on. I live up in NH and the winters up here are BRUTAL so we will see.  By the way, I did use the PreDip Spray and the Dip Release on the tires. Both worked great too.  *** UPDATE - One (1) Year Later - This application is still on and still looks wonderful. This is one year in the harsh New England winter and it's still wonderful. Looks great. I HIGHLY recommend this. By the way the metallic top-coat gives this a very unique finish, looks terrific.
B00CYW0BJ2|5|I bought this for my 2003 Toyota Solara, a mid-size car. I cleaned the roof with alcohol first and used some additional 2-part 3M glue. This visor comes with 3M tape underneath. Hopefully together this thing will never come off.<br /><br />This visor looks and works great. It has about 3/4&#34; extra on each side. One thing is that there is a small opening at the front of the unit. This allows rainwater to drain off so don't glue over those.
B00U9TCGLS|1|You can see in photo that the center screw hole is not perfectly between the two hose inlets.  This did not fit my OEM Chrysler hoses.
B00WJ0WCNW|5|Love my Resqme. Bought the Breast Cancer Awareness which donates also so that's a plus. Very easy to use if needed.
B000E8V0RK|5|I really like these shocks. Great quality. Would buy them again.
B0087NB0ZQ|5|Easy to mount, easy to pair and use. Me and my husband can hear each other quite well on bike upto 90 mph.
B00H5PTQIU|5|Worked great for my 2011 VW GTI. A little higher and it would have touched the base. But the size is perfect. It supports max 1500lbs each.
B007ZGKKMA|4|Bad ass
B00OZT18AS|5|Very satisfied, easy to install and fits great. As other have mentioned, the gap other reviews describe is to account for space when the back seats recline. This item fits into notches already in place in your vehicle, so the gap is FORD's design for the car, not this product or a flaw.<br /><br />I love the privacy it offers and it seems to be great quality. Highly recommend!
B003BZR8LA|4|Poor description on add. This will fit 1 3/4 max.
B00TQ07IOQ|3|NOT VERY HEAVY DUTY, ONLY THING DELUX IS PRICE
B005NLQAHS|5|Works exactly how it says. Very cool.
B001W8TMTE|1|Not that great...already falling apart.
B000C17G9A|5|1 hr to put in and back on the road
B000CMJPNE|5|Great product, great price.  Heavy duty to stand up to feet covered with dirt, rocks, mud, you name it.  Fits perfect in our Jeep, and catches all the junk.  Would recommend.
B000C2U7M2|4|Just installed the water pump today. It looks to be well made and installed well. Prior to installing the pump I noticed some aluminum shavings left over from the manufacturing process in the body of the pump. I took a close look at the pump and removed several more shavings. The pump installed easily.
B00ANR0L36|4|fit good w/ my new ez pass. i recommended to buy it.
B009ZH2AQG|5|Bought this light as a replacement back up for a headlight retrofit, serves its purpose well
B001KRA2AK|4|Nice filter at a great price, most people do not even know they have one of these.
B00KTIDLGI|1|It doesn't work, I proved programming with two different Chevy trailblazer and the result is the same. Don't waste your money with this keyless.
B0009NUG66|5|Worked on a 9 hour trip.  Kept rain out and was quiet.  Mounted on Mazda CX9.
B00HEZ2GJM|1|The fan clutch tool does not fit. The wrench is fine but the holder tool does not fit.
B0002SRECC|4|price was right, fast shipping
B004C01JHC|1|Did not fit my vehicle
B00BEDNXTW|5|very good product, thanks
B00026Z3E0|5|I drive a car with well over 200,000 miles on it. I frequently end up under it trying to break bolts free. These stands easily and securely hold the weight of the car. The extra pin to lock the stands in position gives you that extra piece of mind when trying to get those stubborn bolts. A quality set of stands are a must for anyone who works on cars and these are a nice safe set.
B00HWS7XGW|5|Amazing!  I switched it out on my ATV and what a difference.  Amazing!
B00BFE1YJQ|3|This switch worked as intended but..... The switch buttons are to wide to slide into the mount for the door.
B000FP9WMW|1|Weld broke on it during first use. Returned item. Won't buy again.
B0057XLSCY|5|This worked great. I no longer try and look around my shoulders to see the traffic behind me.
B00JEPDO64|5|bought for my 4x4 1999 Dakota sport the kit exceeded all expectations the fit was spot on no issues what so ever and the actual parts were very high quality and the lift gave my truck the aggressive look I was looking for I am beyond happy I did not have to replace stock shocks or remove any brake lines it was simple you just have to be careful with those torsion bars things can get a little hairy
B00L2RX4CG|5|Looks great on the wall
B005OEIY8W|1|The Rand McNally Dock program for updating this unit is NOT COMPATIBLE with any of the three Macintosh computers I use. They are all running the latest operating system:  OS 10.10.5.  The program is not recognized by Apple as one provided by an acceptable developer.  Their Dock program for updating causes all three of the computers to freeze, with the cursor becoming immobile.  The Gps unit itself has misdirected us several times, fortunately we also use Garmin which is much easier to update.  Plan to purchase Garmin's gps for motorhomes soon.<br /><br />If you have Apple computers do NOT purchase!
B00BRN5XV0|3|Product description said it would fit Jeep Commander but really didn't.  To big.  I had to do some modifications in order to make it work.  For the purchase price, really cannot complain to much other than be disappointed that it didn't fit and being to lazy to return, it is just O.K.
B004FFLEJW|2|This valve will not fit on my vehicle, a 2006 Honda Pilot. The threads fit, but I cannot properly tighten it on the oil pan because the neck of the valve is too wide; and will not allow me to tighten it onto the oil pan. I checked multiple times on both the Amazon website as well as the Fumoto website, and this is the valve that is recommended for my vehicle. This is being sent back for a refund and I'll go back to draining the oil like normal by taking the oil plug out and letting the oil drain out.
B00DJDYMEA|5|Working great so far. nice cold A/C! Thanks for the quick shipping.
B00JJRBWHK|5|Holding this in reserve for my new car purchase next year.
B000NCS7GE|5|Works great. Provides a clear view of when your tank is actually empty. Has not leaked. Cant ask for more than that!
B000HTS5JC|3|Broke to easy only used it for 2 days and it broke
B000EVYGV4|5|Easy to set advance.
B001UCB1C8|1|Don't work right
B0013ZGZ9Q|5|Great battery, works amazingly. And to those saying &#34;over priced&#34; this battery is about 225 plus at auto stores.... So, yeah.
B00I5VQSN4|4|Work good to keep the heat lower
B0073MF9DQ|1|Exact fit from OEM in my 2001 Wrangler SE<br /><br />follow up...this radiator failed after 1 1/2 years,...I will be looking at other vendors for the replacement
B00DWVN08I|4|fits perfect
B001PYCR56|5|Great product
B00VB2OE9O|5|cool
B00I82D2MU|4|Arrived quicker than ETA given at time of order.<br />Chrome finish A1 but some of the flats had scratches under the chrome finish.<br />Closed cap area well finished before chroming and that area is most<br />visible when installed. A lot better than the 24 year old OEM lug nuts,<br />that's for sure. And at $1 apiece just what I needed for this ole F150's<br />factory aluminum wheels. Thanks DPA
B00E9FT9EU|5|good sticker!
B004XAUM6U|5|Fit like a glove! Look great!
B004131NEY|5|Fixed the door!
B001UEFO9M|5|I've had good luck with Beck Arnley items and this was no exception. I notice my 2002 Camry 4 cylinder had slowly been exhibiting worse vibration especially at idle with the AC on. Based on info posted on a Toyota forum, I checked the old original dogbone mount and could see the rubber insulator was cracked pretty much all the way through. Replacing the original with this item immediately and completely cured the idle shake. Very easy DIY, it is only necessary to remove two easy to reach bolts to replace.
B0049U323Y|4|VERY HAPPY !!
B00ARJPZ5E|5|2004 Kia Sedona ,had a faulty coil and this replacement fix the problem ,great product
B0049Z8X4C|1|I purchased this particular keychain because of the simple design and price. The product information led me to believe this was an official BMW product, as well as the box it came in. While the price seemed to be too good to be true, since I was buying from Amazon, I felt it was a sound purchase.<br /><br />One side of the keychain is nearly flawless. The other side, however, is very poor quality. Half the &#34;W&#34; in the logo isn't there.
B005KT2CYS|2|Gaps on side of head
B00UY2TSWK|5|I Love this sticker on the back window of my truck, looks Awesome!!!
B00UIV32YC|5|Very good had 8k before the 6k glad I got the 6k, I can see.  If you have gm you have to match up factory plug black wire to new plug extension black wire.
B000GTW3QO|1|Returned item, as it was not an original chain as advertised.
B000RDAKXW|3|Mechanic needed to modify mounting holes because they didn't line up for my 2007 Jeep Commander. It's only been a couple days so we will see.
B000KL6A9Y|5|Easy to install with common sense.
B000WKAJ7M|5|great product
B00O6D9AF8|4|I was a little skeptical buying this item since there were no reviews or videos on how to hook up this unit, but I have to say this remote starter is amazing. I have it in a 2002 Nissan Frontier. My only problems are: the system won't recognize my tachometer and sometimes the antenna won't pick up the rf signal from the remote even though I'm within 1500 feet but it personally doesn't bother me. Still a great buy!
B00LUKWYQ2|4|Okay switch for the money. The color code of the wires is actually as follows: two white wires = horn, two blue wires = lights, red is common for turn signals, green = left turn signal, yellow = right turn signal.
B0012BL8LG|1|Horrible. Used it for approximately 15 minutes. Shorted out and stopped working piercing 1.5 amp light.
B00KTIVFTS|1|Ridiculously short range. While I successfully programmed them, they only worked if the remote was within 18 inches of the dash. They did work from outside with my hand over the center of the windshield but they were effectively pretty useless.
B0002JMALG|5|I have used this product for several years and find it to do what it says. I have an old Riding Mower that was using oil and smoking and when I added this Oil Stabilizer to my oil it stopped using oil and no more smoke. I have to assume this did the trick since that is all I did to said engine.
B006WHKKGY|4|The only thing different about this part is the connector on the original part is angled upward. I used this on a 2000 Toyota Corolla and it seems to be fine.
B004K9ESAU|1|I bought these cleats with the intent to install them on my 2014 Yamaha FX SHO, but after I looked at the instructions I decided to have the dealer try to install them. After looking at it themselves, they told me it's not possible to install them as there is no access and no reinforced areas of the hull where you can place them!
B001KSAT2K|5|I feel hopeful....
B004AHAE14|3|I bought this to use with an in-line fuse holder but it was too big for the top to close.
B0026S8CBS|5|I have had this on my car since June of 2013.  Seems to be holding up to the weather.  I am very careful with the snow scrapper as I had a sticker on another car on the front windshield and accidentally hit it one wintry day.  It left a dent in the image.  I figured with a the next car I would leave the front alone.<br />The pieces are on white sticky paper and clear plastic on the other side. You pull off the clear plastic then place it onto auto glass. Push down on them repeatedly so they will remain in place during the next step. (That part is important!) Then pull off the white sticker and all of the pieces are still on the glass where you put them (if you pushed on them).
B001BFKW4M|2|very hard to read the temperature even at night
B00OZXBVL0|1|These do not fit our 2003 Honda Pilot at all.  They were beat up and one piece looked like it had been installed on another vehicle before.  No installation instructions and LT Sport doesn't even show them on their website because we tried to look up how to install them.  These are definitely going back!.
B001KN5HKY|5|I bought this yup I sure did
B00449MOSO|5|good
B00GD4HM8A|5|Very Good
B00C59RT30|4|Good product.
B00MBPLPOC|5|Does a good job
B00DELNHJI|5|This mirror worked perfectly. The install was easy, it mounted very solid, and I rode some pretty extreme trails with very little vibration.
B00MY4UFNW|5|They work great so-far
B002MB8TQ2|1|I purchased 3 cans of black, 3 cans of clear coat. I can't return the clear coat due to &#34;shipping requiring special handling&#34;... Of the 3 cans--I unfortunately used on new rims that I spent 5 hours sanding and cleaning--all three cans start to fail with only half of the bottle used. The half that DOES come out does NOT even provide even / consistent coating nor a rich, even colour....very, very dissapointed. I ended-up re-sanding my rims and got a bottle of Rust-Oleum glossy black, and it did the job. A single can to fix the error of 3 awful and overpriced cans from Dupli-Color. I do not recommend this item.
B009PIIPHI|4|very good exact fit easy to enstall
B001OXZ1IS|5|works good
B00H9S71LW|5|Oh it really tells me everything and the Bluetooth setup worked like a charm. This OBDLink software also seems much better than the other software from the appstore.
B001V8UKBY|3|On the first use two of the bolts on the bottom(I guess they are acting as cleats) moved forward almost pulling them out and a couple of the strengthening ribs tore.  I returned the damaged one and in spite of how this one lasted I am going to order another one once I am credited for the return.
B00DM8NLFI|5|Nice
B00HSHVVXI|5|The led lights make the interior of my odyssey so much brighter and beautiful
B009D32AAI|5|Excellent
B000C57ZIS|5|So far so good. Will see for how long.
B000C57WB8|1|Doesn't  fit my gmc 2006 Sierra
B00GWWTICG|5|Fit my 2010 f150
B00318NVRM|5|Worked perfectly in my 2003 Honda CR-V.
B0013FU614|5|Worked perfectly and fixed my issue immediately!!
B0052XN2RI|5|Great quality and product, clamp worked great not sure what others were talking about.  Great product for the money.
B00K7YZQ8A|3|The set is great but the plastic case that organizes the wrenches is fairly flimsy. The plastic &#34;hinge&#34; was broken on mine upon arrival so keeping them organized now is a pain. I'm happy with the wrenches themselves, though.
B00EDF9OKK|5|Worked as expected.<br />My air condition system stopped working.  I suspected a slow refrigerant leak, and this helped me trace the leak and I was able to fix the problem.
B001544RL8|5|Perfect fit for 1978 CJ-7
B007XJ9CBO|5|I love this lanyard. It's really cool looking with the vocaloids. I thought it would take forever but it came in three days. I highly recommend you vocaloid fans out there to get this lanyard.
B001GC2LVM|5|Love this leveler.  I've used leveling blocks before and hated them.  This is by far the easiest way to level my Casita travel trailer.
B00355OW2O|4|Does what it's supposed to. On my 2003 I had to trim a little off. Apparently it comes longer than the actual length of the area on the car...
B00FB83ODG|1|The main hole is too large for my stock supply line. I am having to order another one from somewhere else.
B001CEG96C|5|Fit well and works great!
B0007ZG9TO|5|Good stuff. Recommended for any project big or. Small.
B006E0OXIA|5|Worked perfect!!!!! Great gasket head set and great quality!!!
B000FKKOK6|5|[[VIDEOID:69fe2ef5c8ff28ca7e4f6508e20d7b2a]]Great sound when paired with the FIAMM 72112.    Remember, pair the 72102 (High) with the 72112 (Low).    Nice replacements for broken horns or horns that sound too weak.    Still working strong after 3 years.
B00K1C1WC2|4|They're wheel chocks. Not much that you can say about them. they keep you safe and they do a good job at that.
B00YI3IGA6|5|nifty and really work
B000C9OLPY|5|this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements
B0002NYE5M|4|c
B00G6JNO2U|5|Would buy again....
B00BTSFN54|5|I bought this bluetooth headset with the AFX FX-41DS helmet and the installation was a breeze !!! The sound quality is clear and there is no latency between your paired device. The bluetooth unit and battery pack has a sleek curved design which mounts just fine on the inside of the AFX helmet, no bulky look. The bluetooth unit mounts on the side and the battery pack mounts on the back of the helmet, really neat design. The whole installation took me and my assistant about 30 minutes or less. The kit includes everything you need to install with the option of Velcro or double sided 3 M. 4 way intercom, bike to bike and passenger communication.
B00CFALFXY|5|These are medium weight cloths. Not too thin and not too thick. They are value priced. By getting the multi color set, you can segregate them for your various uses. And their uses are myriad - from dusting to cleaning to face cloths. I only recently learned that all microfiber cloths are not ideal for drying in your clothes drier. The heat defeats their construction, so air fluff in the drier or simply air dry.
B00FYXJDA6|3|I hate to give this a bad review. I was so disappointed when this would not fit my steering wheel I have searched and searched for a Dolphins cover that would fit. It's very nice looking but it does not fit. I have a Ford Expedition. It says it's for trucks but it doesn't fit at all. We let it get warm in the sun and my husband is a big guy and he could not get it on.
B006WB8256|5|Fits great on helmet. Helps me to be a more &#34;mysterious&#34; guy on a motorcycle, I wouldn't have it any other way!
B00684TAYY|5|SAVED MY LIFE!!!!! I have gone 6 months without a keyless entry due to it cracking along the spot that holds it onto your keyring. Dealership told me $80 so I decided against that, fast forward to now and I see one for $7 on amazon!!!!!
B0038AVHGU|3|As has been stated  the side marker lights don't fit otherwise seems like a good product,  1990 chevy silverado k1500
B00ERIA8XU|5|Adorable product, quick delivery!!
B001447VB2|4|Good stuff!
B009VUABEA|5|2011 Hyundai Sonata
B0002SR4PY|5|Great product, Holds filter tight,
B00IE3Z4DS|5|nice fit and finish .
B000NKCIKM|4|AWESOME!
B00ZY1MIFA|5|Loved this, looks great and works really well ! Go Hawks!!
B00HGHM468|5|Works great, good product
B009DK30ZU|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B00080QGYG|5|Great product
B004I0L2BE|5|It was exactly what I needed and at a price better than any other offer.  I would definitely order again from this company.
B00KQY8T1W|4|Good to go!
B00T2GT9L4|5|I've been looking for a mobile jump solution for a while.  When I saw this I thought no way this will start a car.  I was completely wrong.  Despite being compact, this thing had plenty of oomph to start my care multiple times in between charges.<br /><br />I will also say it came in a very nice compact case to carry it and all of the accessories.<br /><br />I am very pleased so far.
B0000AY4YJ|5|Use this on my boat every year, good quality and keeps my boat looking new
B00EAIG58E|5|Incredibly easy to operate. Only took 5 minutes to set up on 2014 STI. The OTS maps are pretty good, they Immediately give you a greater appreciation of your Subaru. They allow the turbo to spool to a higher PSI in Sport# mode, and keep the turbo pretty tame in Intelligent mode. Cobb's maps are much smoother and enjoyable than the stock tune. Some people may find the OTS maps to be a bit too smooth and underwhelming. You may want to look into getting an E-Tune from a reputable tuner, some of them can get a bit more performance out of the stock hardware, and make the car a bit more exciting to drive. Either way, you'll need the Cobb AP.<br /><br />Some people complain about the price of the AP, Yes it's not cheep, neither is your car, I'm willing to bet. If you feel uncomfortable forking out $600 for the single most essential mod for your car, then maybe you're in the wrong place.<br /><br />Yes I said single most important mod. Don't you dare put any other air intake on your Subaru without tuning it first. And if you cut off your cats, you won't see any gains in performance without a tune.
B0040CTYAQ|5|good
B009IK6US4|5|I had one of these on my 1951 Ford convertible and loved it. Have one now on my 2003 Tundra, great for backing up my 25 foot trailer. Great all the way around.
B007KTINWQ|4|This is an excellant product..I always buy when visiting the US....
B00OFQCJGS|5|They work and look great
B00PZDZI7C|5|great idea
B00X7JY8HM|5|I was super excited to get these car sunshades. The Grande Jumbo III works great on my Chevy hhr and jeep liberty. We have gotten other sunshades from xshade and we used it on my husband's Honda civic. I have also tried other car shades and compared to the xshade do no justice to them. Texas heat is horrible and thankfully the x-shade sunshade protects my wheel seat belt and chair from getting super hot from the sum. So it's easier to drive and move around the car without burning my back or hand with the steering wheel. They are easy to put up too which I've always had a trouble to do with other sunshades. They cover completely my front window as well which I've always had large spaces in between most of the sunshades before.<br /><br />I recieved this product for free to test and give my 100% unbiased opinion and review of the x-shade car sunshades. Getting them for free has not changed my review of the product.
B008DEY87Q|5|These should come standard on a $65,000 truck. Definitely makes things easier for cleanup in the wheel wells.
B00HJ15AJ4|4|it was for my daughter.  looks good.  no complaints
B0002MABGE|1|Horrible!  The rattling is impossible to stop.  Tried duct tape, crazy glue and wire ties and it still rattles.  The tightening devices do not work.  Nearly impossible to stop this irritating noise!
B0055PD1H4|5|Does a good job if the plastic isn't too bad.
B005QURVB0|3|note the loop created to hold something can not be made very small, the loop does not go the whole length
B006VZG5X4|5|Fits perfectly and looks much nicer than the stock one. I got it to replace the stock one after it cracked in a drop. I was surprised to discover this one has an extra bump, presumably to deflect more air around the rider. I haven't noticed a difference on that score, but it might make a difference to someone who doesn't wear a full helmet. It's extremely sturdy and well designed.
B009DK2ZH4|5|Work great, fit great, just as expected.
B002UW5EQQ|1|I have had nothing but trouble with mine. Sometimes it worked sometimes it didn't. It cam to an end this weekend. I plugged it in and it started smoking.  I am just glad I was there to get it pulled out and thrown out before it started a fire in my camper.
B0049U05CA|5|Excellent price fit and performance! Would highly recommend.
B000CQBFII|5|I suspect your exhaust system will rust and wear out long before this donut will fail. Not much you can say about it other than it works as intended and it gives a little flexibility to your exhaust pipe to move around slightly with a spring bolt kit. If you bolted your pipe to the manifold without it you’ll have a leak and the flared end on the pipe couldn’t move on the rounded surface of the donut and would likely break. If there are any rough spots on the side toward the pipe they should be smoothed out before installation. Prices vary and that’s why I didn’t purchase the two I needed for my 1990 Chevy K2500 here.
B004GC0WXS|5|Bumper fits great! Factory lower valance fits perfect!! Would by again!!
B005FN5VU6|4|Item was delivered on time, was easy to use and met our expectations.
B0035YGLZG|5|Does what its supposed to do and looks to be build durable. I mounted it on a wood base and put sides on it to protect it.
B00LO4KHHW|5|nice
B00WS3P37C|4|good
B00PR9YISE|5|This is one of the best items I've purchased to accessorize my Jeep. I like the additional coverage without blocking views and airflow.
B000CCM41Y|5|Works great and the flex spout is very handy. It allowed me to oil a hard to reach attic fan motor.
B000BQSZNC|5|Nice addition to our RV!
B00KN0UOEE|3|I do not see any benefit, so I can only hope it is protecting against UV damage.
B001BK24IY|4|Fit perfect and worked great
B003V57NUQ|5|These worked like a champ on top of my Honda Pilot after the Honda dealer told me I needed I needed to use there products at over 4 times the cost. They told me after market items would not fit.. Boy were they wrong....  I was able to put them together myself and mounted them on my vehicle with ease!!!,
B005G66A7A|5|Bed rug mats work well. Keep things from sliding around.
B00PTQOF4W|5|If you wire it the right way, it will work flawless. Bought the switch for my 32&#34; light bar worked perfect.
B00YMTJ6R8|5|Installed, and trimmer started and run without problem. Only time will tell length of service.  Delivery was very good.
B006WPQMWM|5|Very good porta potty. Sturdy, comfortable and easy to empty. Lasted a family of 5 (2 adults, 3 kids) 3 days.
B003ZOH63W|5|Worked well
B00D42AFS8|1|Crap, crap, crap. Bought as emergency starter for a SeaDoo wave runner. Tried once (battery was completely dried) and didn’t work (supposedly should start a small V8 and the 3 cylinder, 1500cc from Bombardier was too much for it). Charged 4 hours the battery with an AC charger, and just then “helped” the starter to make the WR start. Stored for 7 months, and notwithstanding didn’t have hope in still finding any juice in it, what was surprising is that now is completely dead with cero charging hability. If you want to put your safety into the “PowerNone”, good luck…
B008DJ6L4Y|5|I wanted to keep the stock look but do something different at the same time. These did the job. No fogging or condensation YET! Running 35 watt HID's in the lows. Had a shipping mix up, Also had to align them but it was a simple process that anybody should know how to do.
B00G9AFQSQ|2|Luckily I didn't need this Item and was able to get a refund. Seller was AWESOME and I would buy from again, however, the work involved with changing just the inserts is an unnecessary waste of time. Pollution be damned! When I get new wipers, I want the whole assembly since the whole assembly moves with every swipe of the windshield and wears out, just as the blades do.
B000CFCV1E|5|Installed these about 4 months ago and everything fit perfectly and i have not had a problem. Good quality replacement axles
B004N1MH1C|5|We are delighted to have received our order. Hooray! We immediately placed our stickers onto the bumpers. Thank you
B00COYNVPQ|3|the pictures are very faint on this wheel cover. I expected to see it clearly but really have to look to see it
B005JYWD0C|5|Gets the job done, fits right and seals tight
B00YDE2SKO|4|Works great, sticks up easily.
B000RGS4IM|5|Excellence in a wiper blade.
B007FITDJ4|3|Excellent match for my Tahoe, but the hardware was different so I had to make due with the original hardware.
B008L5NXG4|5|This is a great looking battery box top for my 2003 Suzuki VL1500 Intruder.  Parts shipped almost imediatly, recieved in 2 days. Cleaned up my bike which didn't come with a battery cover when I bought it.<br /><br />Thanks Gary, you are one of the best!
B00PFH6W64|1|Not a fit, you have to drill holes through some VERY thick metal on your pedals that is NOT meant to be drilled. I was shipped the wrong size and was told I had to pay for return shipping. I would recommend looking at the Moonet brand for a perfect OEM fit
B006YBC9L2|5|Good fabric
B000CMGZSW|5|This is an acceptable replacement for the lower shifter boot on a Peugeot 505. It stretches over the mounting lip and can be held in place with a long zip tie (or multiples linked together). Discard the included metal mounting plate.
B004PL87JQ|5|fit nice, did the job
B003OHO2DC|5|Perfect fit, reasonably priced.
B007SKAKPU|1|Did not work with my car, I have a 2007 Chevy Aveo
B000XECJES|5|These are so soft and they don't leave any fuzz behind when cleaning.  I use them for a whole bunch of house cleaning tasks
B00LG07MZE|3|Will fit a 2005 Chevy Van??
B0002U26QE|5|Love this stuff
B000AME50Y|1|Did not work
B00FQSK9IY|5|This fit perfectly and fixed my overheating due to a gummed-up radiator in less than an hour.<br /><br />It might be a bit quicker, since I have a manual Subaru Outback Limited and didn't have to deal with the transmission cooler connections.  The original radiator also had the unused transmission cooler ports.
B000GU0MWA|5|Excellent
B00XC3KMD2|5|Love them. Took me awhile to install but figured it out and I can't complain. Maybe for future reference they should send instructions!!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
B000GVGDZ4|5|Excellent
B0010EG5AO|4|Clean tasting water. But mine leaks from the end caps. However....it sat in the sun in my pickup dash for almost a month before use. So I'm thinking it warped...if that's the case it's not the manufacturers fault. Well try another one and see what happens. If no problems I'll go five star. If it leaks I'll go one star.
B001JDE6ZW|4|The two mirrors are great! It was a little pricy and the quality of the product is not amazing but it serves it's purpose very well. And they shake a little bit but it is no problem. They are very handy
B00DP4ZHL0|5|Everyone loves this sticker because everyone hates seeing 13.1 and 26.2 stickers where people brag about running.
B00F5827DK|5|Thanks
B00DTNGVLM|5|Yes My family
B009NCLT2O|3|It looks very cute on the back of my car , but I could only place it on the exterior of the car I didn't know
B0036M6SAK|4|don't try and sew hard things like sail cloth or thick leather without this. it turns the impossible into doable. and you can pretend you are far more handy than you really are
B010SPPV1E|4|It ended up being a bit wobbly, not a perfectly tight fit
B00PQWN5DQ|5|Good item.
B00X5S0WKC|2|Good quality but I had a lot of problems getting these to work on my 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. They would flash on/off and eventually stay off.  I was told to try resistors/decoders but that didn't help.  I wish these would have worked! The few seconds they were on the color and brightness were great!
B002WB0M8K|1|I had very high hopes for this product but I am very disappointed.  I hoped for the squeaking to go away when l just installed them, but alas the squeaking persists. The major problem with these disc pads are that they got hot while going downhill and COULD NOT STOP my Camry on a short trip to the country. I was changing gears in my automatic transmission like it were standard! It was quite scary pressing the brake and having no stopping power especially going downhill and around corners.<br />I decided immediately to buy some new disc pads and change out these Wagner ThermoQuiet QC1293. I lost on this transaction.<br />I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B00EC0ZD4W|5|Perfect fit
B009B6IQHS|1|Didn't come with adapters so I'm still trying to figure out how to get it on.
B00AKEVGIG|5|Best oil filter for the money
B004ZF4LNI|5|works good litle expensive hope they last
B003EP3ACS|5|perfect would use again
B002XUXUTS|4|Critical last step of installation is aiming the sensors.  When this step has been done properly, they work.
B001BAGKNO|5|Love it! It is one of the few wheel covers that will fit my truck.
B001AGHIF8|4|good it fits right on nice sound
B004TLKA3I|1|Quick delivery but a problem with the product. After I installed the trunk, and added lights, I found that the lock was difficult to open. I contacted the seller, who responded quickly, but was told that replacement parts were not available and there was nothing that could be done. I sprayed the lock and went on a long road trip.  Halfway through the trip, the lock stopped working. The key would not turn it, and (I guess luckily) the mechanism would not latch. I had to bungee the top down to prevent it from opening when riding. So I no longer had a lockable trunk.  While the price for this trunk was reasonable, not having access to, or warranty, on parts is a big drawback. In the long run, it is worth spending more on a product that has better service and support.
B00BI3M3FI|5|very nice clean fit to bad iv wrecked and broke already
B00EDQ14DE|5|Fit my 2009 Escalade perfectly. Couldn't be happier.
B00WHS3OR4|1|Did not fit. Way too small. To return product would cost way too much to ship over seas. The phone number to call company is also listed over seas.
B000924QO0|4|Got this for my husband who loves it. Says it does a really great job.
B00QMWQK2M|5|great
B0015PTUXW|5|These break lights look great and give my 01 F250 a newer look. I would recommend these if you are in need to replacement tail lights.
B008C52Y86|5|Good replacement pump. Scooter now has NO hard starting issues and seems to go faster...<br />This pump was larger than the stock one so required me to use only one bolt and a zip tie to mount it in place but it is very secure so no worries.
B003UIDQ0K|5|This wax has a somewhat pleasant smell, is very easy to put on with a microfiber cloth without any elbow grease, and makes the counter-tops very glass like smooth. Good product. Prefer this to car wax etc.
B0002NYC0Y|4|Worked as advertised for a VW half shaft, thankfully they're durable enough that I wont need to buy another set in this lifetime.
B003BMCL4M|5|Exactly as needed,  great price and arrived on time.  Quality is excellent.
