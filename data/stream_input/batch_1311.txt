1451627289|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I have to say I'm sorry the read is over. This is one of the best Stephen King novels I've ever read (I've read nearly all of them). The story deals with the concept of time travel but is far removed from the realm of sci-fi. It's a real can't put it down page turner. I loved it. Can't wait for the movie?!
B0041KKYBA|2.0|We ended up watching it on a computer because it wouldnt play on our DVD player.  Good show but disappointing that we couldn't view it on big screen.  Frightening content - I had no idea Wall St was so corrupt!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Decent game for a child. It's amazing what some of these children will complain about when the app is free. If it bothers you so much, start paying for apps.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I believe this app is great for young children. It runs smoothly; I have not had any troubles. It never hurts to have a few apps like this loaded onto your device because you never know when you might need to entertain a young child.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|This game is so messed up. They would show a bear, a dog, a fox, and a boy, and the bear would be different. Do not get. Totally messed up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is the best game that I have ever downloaded!!!!!! It is so awesome! This is my favorite game ever!!!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|This review isn't about the movie as much as it is about how I am continually impressed with Amazon. I purchased this DVD to be a Christmas gift for my best friend's husband.  When I buy DVDs as gifts, I'm often overcome with temptation to remove the shrink wrap and watch it before I gift it.  Imagine my pleasant surprise when I checked my Amazon video library to see a copy of it good for up to 30 days after my purchase!  I was able to watch the movie and still get to gift an unopened DVD. My Roku and I had a good time with a bag of popcorn and coke!  I'll be looking again for DVDs that offer this feature when gifting movies!  Thanks, Amazon, for that nice little treat!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Let me begin this review by addressing the recent headlines surrounding the incident that occurred between Chris Kyle and Jesse Ventura.  Don't buy this book to read about that.  Kyle only devotes a page or so at best to this insignificant event.  The rest of the book overshadows those few paragraphs.  I reluctantly purchased this particular book after having read several books relating the Navy Seal Teams.  Right away I found this book to be a refreshing change to the ones I've recently read.  Unlike the others, Kyle does'nt dwell on his time at BUDS.  He sums it up by saying in so many words that there are other books and television shows depicting what BUDS is all about.  He gives only a few pages to BUDS.  The book takes you from Kyle's early life through his Navy career and his life after the Seal teams and into the beginning of his business venture.    One of the more intersting aspects of the book is that Kyle's story is interspersed with his wife Taya sharing her perspectives.  Kyle's story and Taya's thoughts come together to illustrate the important part that his family plays in his life.    I also found it interesting that Kyle downplays interservice rivalry between the other branches of the military.  He is VERY complimentary of the Marine Corps and also has some very positive things to say about the Arkansas National Guard.  Kyle also gives a private glimpse into his relationship with teamates Ryan Job and Marc Lee, both of whom are deceased.  His stories and thoughts on these two heroes are particularly touching.  I wont go in depth into the story lines by giving a blow by blow description of the entire book.  I must say though that this book was a nice change of pace from the other Seal books that I've recently read.  It's well written and pretty much  follows a chronological order with out much back and forth.  One of the complaints I read was that he does'nt go into too much detail on some of his kills.  Some of the details could possibly be classified.    This book is fast, easy read from a somewhat different perspective.  What it lacks in detail about his kills, it makes up for what comes from his heart.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Ok games but must party to unlock more, I am getting points for even annoying this review. Its write annoying
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover! It protects my Kindle Fire and also looks so stylish. I was worried that it would add a lot of bulk to the tablet, but it's very slim/trim and that has not been a problem at all. The other reviewers are correct in that it's a little difficult to wrestle the Fire into the elastic, but you WANT it to be in there tightly and securely. Once it's fastened, it doesn't slip around. The cover does not lie flat immediately, but I stored it face-down (closed) overnight with a moderately heavy cookbook on top, and in the morning (and ever since) it has closed completely and is now \\"molded\\" to the Kindle. The leather is soft and nice-looking. I got it in red, although I would have wanted the green if they had it when I ordered. The red is a little brighter than in the picture, but still looks like a classic old book.
0307272702|1.0|I regret buying this book since I hate to waste my hard earned money. It is so scientific I cannot wrap my mind around it: It is not practical and I was hoping for more guidance, including recipes. I was never good at Science. He even gets into Global Warming which is a load of crock to begin with. The only photo is of a rat... a rat! UGH!! I hope someone will buy this book off of me, I posted it on Craigslist!

0374275637|4.0|Thinking Fast, Slow And Not At All (Published in Forbes.com 1/10/12)      Reading Daniel Kahneman's fantastic new book, Thinking Fast and Slow, on the eve of a presidential election can only lead to despair. Yet his careful experiments-designed to reveal how our monkey brains have evolved to make decisions-go a long way toward explaining the effectiveness of political propaganda designed to exploit our inherent mental laziness.     Kahneman's Nobel Prize-winning research ranges across a lifetime of psychological experiments, all of which point to the inescapable conclusion that we have two systems of thought that are at best loosely connected. Bridging that gap is the key to keeping democracy from destroying itself. Let me explain.     The first bit of mental machinery, which Kahneman blandly calls System One, works 24/7 to keep us out of trouble, while alerting us to fleeting opportunities. Appropriate for a species that is both predator and prey, System One lives in a world of snap judgments, extensible metaphors, ill-informed biases, and loosely constructed rules of thumb. We sometimes call this decision making apparatus intuition. Man's intuition is sophisticated enough that it has helped us thrive across a variety of ever changing environments.     Despite its utility, System One is often wrong, especially if numbers are involved. For a trivial example, answer quickly: If the sum of the cost of a ball and bat is $1.10 and the bat cost a dollar more than the ball, what does the ball cost? Your System One answer (most likely wrong) is good enough to avoid mistaking a hungry lion for a tasty chicken. But it's not good enough to build an airplane or design an effective income tax code. (The answer is a nickel, not a dime.)     System Two is associated with enumeration, computation, objective analysis, and complex chains of logic. It is our rational brain. Kahneman's work shows that even scientists like himself use System Two very sparingly, calling on it only when System One asks for help. In addition, in order to function at the highest levels, System Two requires training, discipline, concentration, skeptical and impartial evaluation of purported facts, and the ruthless elimination of contradictions.     We are all born with a System Two, but obviously, some people use it more readily than others. For example, it's not surprising for numerous studies to show that most people are spectacularly wrong in their estimates of numerical quantities-how many illegal aliens are there in the country, or what percent of the federal budget goes to Social Security and Medicare? What is surprising is that when these same people are given the correct facts, they remain highly resistant to modifying their beliefs. Apparently, most people do not rely on System Two to develop belief systems. Rather, they use System One and then selectively gather facts to support their conclusions, rejecting data and glossing over logic that doesn't fit preconceived notions.     It has taken centuries to create a culture in which exceptionally skilled practitioners of System Two can deliver progress by challenging the status quo without being burned at the stake. It took further centuries to harness the results of System Two thinking to build a complex technological society that delivers unprecedented material benefits to populations so large that millions would perish if advanced technologies that are commonplace today, and magic to most people, were to disappear. We can thank markets for the fact that they don't.     However, when it comes to electing increasingly all-powerful political leaders whose policies can unravel entire industries at a whim, it's all System One all the time. Our political discourse has no room for System Two thinking. In fact, the opposite is true. Every ounce of campaign energy and the lion's share of media attention are devoted to manipulating our snap judgments, extensible metaphors, ill-informed biases, and loosely constructedrules of thumb.     Yes, both sides call on experts to back up their claims-which are invariably disputed by the other side's experts. To resolve the conflict, each side appeals to our System One-never asked to do the math, but to decide which experts to believe. Rarely do politicians ask voters to use their own System Two to truly understand and evaluate an issue. All of this makes sense, given the reluctance of most people to expend the mental energy, and the infrequency with which people change their minds once System One has made the call.     This does not bode well for unlimited democracy, as it has become increasingly easy for politicians to assemble majorities by promising voters that they can eat their cake and have it, too. Who cares if the numbers don't add up as long as the majority can demand that someone else provide the cake? No matter how many times frugal killjoys have sounded the alarm, we've never run out before, have we? Is it any surprise that politicians want us to focus on the here and now and stop worrying about the long run?     After all, the  experts agree that in the long run we are all dead.     # # #     Bill Frezza is a Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute and a Boston-based venture capitalist.

0545265355|5.0|I am like the millions of other readers who came across Hunger Games, in search of a good book and became completely entrapped in the story. I could not put it down. How many times have you heard somebody say that about a book? This is the first book where that was actually true for me.<br /><br />I am not a very dedicated reader. I enjoy short stories, articles, readings that I can actually use in my life as a teacher and a wife. However, one summer, I had an extremely boring job supervising people working out at a gym. I knew this was the time to become a reader!! I actually went to amazon to research some books that would best fit what I'm looking for and I saw the Hunger Games. After reading the description, I went to my library to check it out. I finished it the next day. I had mixed emotions. I had just read the best book of my life and then it was over! At that time, book 2 was not published. I was fortunate enough to have read it just months before the release of Catching Fire. I can't imagine being a reader who had to wait longer than that!! I of course read it as soon as it came out. I loved all the new additions coupled with memories from book 1. By the end of Catching Fire, I was finally part of a freaky book-loving sector of the planet! yay. Mockingjay was harder for me to get into at first, but I ended up loving that one as well!!<br /><br />Here are my thoughts on why this is such a great read for so many of us who normally wouldn't be this excited about a book.<br /><br />First Person: This is an automatic plus with me. I love hearing a story from SOMEONE'S point of view! I find it strange that many authors create a bystander to tell the story. I definitely prefer the main character to be the one analyzing, depicting, and struggling through the events themselves.<br /><br />Present Tense: This is a huge reason many of us claim we cannot set the book down. If the book had been written in past tense, the fighting scenes would not have been nearly as intense. The semi-love story would not have been nearly as awkward and raw as they were for Katniss herself. They would have been mere accounts of a past event. We live life in the present!! Not knowing what happens next is such a thrill.<br /><br />Concise yet descriptive: This is nothing more than pure talent from Collins. I cannot tell you how many books I HAD to PUT DOWN because they were just wayyy too long and drawn out. They would have these ridiculous descriptions of characters that seemed forced, like they were exploding with all the adjectives they could fit in. Sometimes the details are in the quiet, simple phrases here and there. I do love how Collins gives small pictures here and there for us to draw our own image of what a character should look like/act like/speak like. When an author writes something like \\"Jane, crowned in autumn-colored hair that cascaded down her long, slender body like a waterfall splashes on the rocks in mid-June, longingly gazed into the emerald jeweled eyes of the one who caused her heart to merrily sing like the yellow-feathered chickadee on a spring morning.\\" I basically want to bang my head on the book and cry \\"NO MORE!!!\\" I hate weird and forced adjectives that lose the reader in the corny metaphors. Collins keeps it real, raw, and eerily subtle, while still somehow creating that feeling that you are right there with them watching every moment unfold. Genius.<br /><br />As you can see, I do not have Collins' gift of creating concise descriptions!!! I have said enough for now, but I am excited to see what kind of spin the movie world will give to HG... We'll see!!ave been nearly as awkward and raw as they were for Katniss herself.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|actually more addicting then I thought it would be. a lot of coins are needed but as I try to collect more and more, time flies.
0316044695|5.0|This book like many others started off a bit slow for me.  But once I got to the meat of the story...Oh boy!  I could not put this book down!  Thrilling, chilling, satisfying are certainly words I would use in describing this story.  You will have an even greater appreciation of Navy Seals after this fine read.  Highly recommend!
B005KELQEU|5.0|A nice bit of kit, well padded to protect the kindle and is also very easy on the eye and looks the part!  Definately worth the money.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are simple to understand and play, yet some are rather challenging to win. gets a bit boring playing the same games to collect enough credit to &quot;purchase&quot; more games.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I have found plenty of apps to entertain my 4 1/2 year old, but that left my 2 1/2 year old on the sidelines. downloaded this app and within 5 minutes my young one was holding and playing the Kindle just like his older sister. The puzzles are similar to the large wood puzzles that cost $15+ for each.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It has a lot of good games that can be difficult that can can make it better because it gets you to try and try until you get it right. still playing it and still gaining points to get more games. I think that you should get this game because it has a lot of games you buy with the points you won.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I wasn't sure what I would think of this game when I got it (on a whim - it was the free featured game on my kindle fire).. but I like how the points you earn let you pick which games you open next, it mixes things up and keeps it interesting.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I must admit that I did not find \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" to be a particularly well-written book (some of the characters fell rather flat, certain aspects of the plot were undeveloped, and the dialogue seemed a bit contrived at times), but it sucked me in nonetheless. Despite its literary shortcomings, I did not want to put it down, and Riggs managed to keep me interested until the end.   The vintage photographs that punctuated the writing were an added bonus for me, and they pulled me even deeper into the story. It would be interesting to know the true stories behind the photos, but Riggs does a pretty good job of weaving a tale to piece them together.    I hope that the sequel (set to be released in the summer of 2013) is just as good, or better, than this first book!

B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is one of, if not the best movie collection sets.  From top to bottom this set oozes quality, and is a real treat to own for fans of the Alien movies.<br /><br />Video quality (especially on the amazing transfers of Alien and Aliens) is outstanding.  It's almost like you're watching a new movie when you see the clarity of Alien.  The sound is also right where you'd hope it would be.  You can easily creep yourself out even with a sub-standard sound system like mine.<br /><br />If you, like me, have always enjoyed the Alien movie franchise, you will absolutely love this collection.  Even the packaging is top-notch.  I have yet to dip into the special features, as I just received this as a gift this holiday season, but everything I have experienced with this set, I have enjoyed.

B005TQAI6G|3.0|I want to start by saying that I saw this show live in NJ and it was AMAZING. I am a huge Britney fan but I was nervous about the show because I didn't want to think that I had spent that much money to hear the woman lip sync. I was SO pleasantly surprised that for over 60% of the concert you could hear her way louder than the backtrack. Unfortunatly, people at EPIX apparently wanted to add fuel to the criticisms about her not singing live by releasing a DVD that was COMPLETELY dubbed over by the Femme Fatale CD vocals. So disappointing. If you want to see what the Femme Fatale Tour was really like, GO TO YOUTUBE! This DVD blows.

1451627289|5.0|I have been a Stephen King Constant Reader since I was a kid in the eighties. We broke up for a while in the nineties but for the most part it has been a long and happy association. I looked forward to the release of 11/22/63, often checking my pre-order status. I was thrilled to learn that King would be exploring time travel, a sub-genre he has only toyed with in the past.<br /><br />11/22/63 doesn't disappoint. In fact it thrills on all the levels that matter to a reader. The characters, always strong with King, are memorable and immediate. The plot and the setting are striking and entrancing. These are standard King strengths you say? So where is the improvement? The improvement is in the ending, which is strong and as King is a self-described \\"organic\\" writer who doesn't know where the story is taking him when he starts, his endings have classically been his sole weak point as a writer. That is not the case in this book; the ending is so strong as to seem inevitable and fated.<br /><br />Jake Epping is a teacher who frequents the local hamburger dive and is friendly with the owner, but it is a friendship of setting rather than choice, so imagine Jake's surprise when he gets a frantic phone call from Al, the owner, requesting his immediate life or death help. Al reveals that his hamburger joint has a portal to 1958. During the course of explanations Al reveals that he has been attempting to use the portal to change the past and avoid Oswald's assassination of John F. Kennedy, a watershed moment in history that changed everything that came after. All is dying and can no longer pursue the mission himself.<br /><br />Though he has misgivings, Jake has no real ties to the present and agrees to live in the past for five years and to take on the huge task of changing history. After this wonderful set-up, all bets are off. This is a wonderful book with meditations on the nature of love, time and reality. It is both literate and literature and even though it partakes of the device of time travel it reads as straight fiction. Horror elements are kept to a tantalizing glimmer. The real horror is in the existential questions that are raised, answered and left open. Another reviewer described this book as mature and I have to agree.<br /><br />This is a great novel and King deserves as many accolades as possible. Read this book as a portrait of the America that is was and could be. Read it as a portrait of ourselves and an existential meditation, but read this novel. You won't be sorry.

B006O5Y0SS|4.0|Midnight in Paris is not one of Woody Allen's 'bigger, serious' films. It is a small delight not meant to discover any epiphanies or push any agenda social or otherwise. It is about the love of Paris, Art and the 1920's and as a love letter to those three things it works very, very well.<br /><br />Owen Wilson plays Gil Pender, a man visiting Paris with his fiancee and her parents. Gil is a writer, a lover of Paris and a romantic who idealizes the life of the expatriate American artists and writers who so famously colonized Paris in the 1920's. It becomes clear early on that Gil and his intended are an ill-assorted couple, even to the point that they don't want to do the same tourist activities. There are deeper issues as well. Gil wants to quit Hollywood screenwriting and pursue novel writing, preferably in Paris. Inez, his girlfriend wants him to continue doctoring scripts so that they can afford eighteen thousand dollar chairs for their projected house in Malibu. One night Gil's fiancee goes dancing with other friends and Gil gets lost in the twisty streets of Paris. A mysterious vintage car stops and its inhabitants invite him to a party. It is some invitation as the party is in the Paris of the 1920s and with the artists that Gil so loves.<br /><br />What follows is a loving romp through that time period and to Gil's ultimate realization of how he should live his life. Even the character says that these are only minor insights. However, Allen's artistry and experience really show in every aspect of the movie. Paris is lovingly shot and the Lost Generation is wonderfully portrayed. As the theme was nostalgia and its dangers, I must in all honesty say that this movie had similarities to an earlier work of Allen's, The Purple Rose of Cairo, which also features the imaginary becoming real. I saw that movie in a theater when I was twelve years old and that movie enchanted me then as this movie enchants me now. Recommended but don't expect a major work like Match Point; this is a wonderful minor work.<br /><br />The one criticism I had is that Owen Wilson and his fiancee seemed a little old for the time in life they were portraying. People pushing 40 are generally not on their first marriage or if they are not so influenced by the opinions of their parents. Actors and actresses in their twenties for the part of Gil and Inez would have worked much better.erful minor work.

B005IKZ1B0|5.0|I bought the regular (unedited) version of the album, & I LOVE it!!!  Almost every track is a great club/dance/party song!  I get annoyed when I buy a mix CD and it's just drums and noise effects. This album is the real deal!  Awesome songs, with the whole songs (verses, chorus, etc) included.  Not just bass & drums for DJs to work with.  If you like instrumentals/dubs or are a DJ, then pay the extra 2 - 5 dollars for the deluxe editions.  If you just want some great mixes of great songs, then save your money and just buy the regular version of this album.  I personally love tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9. 11, 12, & 13.  Tracks 3 & 8 are pretty good too, but track 10 is a boring/annoying instrumental (one of the crappy tracks available on the &#34;deluxe&#34; edition). I hope this review helps some music lovers out there to save money wasted on boring instrumentals.
0525478817|5.0|I went into this novel as blind as I possibly could, which meant ordering it back in July and promptly forgetting about it until I got the shipment notification. Being a fan of John Green's other novels and having read some vague things about this one, I was unsure what exactly I was getting. Another formulaic Looking For Alaska/Paper Towns boy-meets-girl? A road trip?<br /><br />Regardless, The Fault in Our Stars is fabulous, phenomenal, astounding, staggering, incredible, and all sorts of other synonyms for how much I loved this book. I read it in a day, I laughed (if there's one thing Green does well, it is writing teenagers that sound like teenagers), I cried (more like sobbed like I was watching the series finale to Six Feet Under), and I screamed incoherently with a friend who was also reading the novel.

There was an updated release in 2000, but I am not familiar with the differences between the films. The music was played by The Philadelphia Orchestra and conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The film starts out with a rather long, but informative intro by music critic and composer, Joseph Deems Taylor. Fantasia gives the audience an interesting way to experience orchestra music in seven separate animated segments. There is only one segment where the music was written for the animation. Every segment is equally as great as the next. The animation is superb and will keep the attention of anyone who watches. Take note that this was made in the 1940s so producers were not so concerned about near nudity shown in cartoons or signs of racism. Or maybe it's just a Disney thing, but if you are really concerned about it, these types of images only occur briefly. Some examples are in the scene with the centaurs and the naked devils. The centaurs were in same color pairs. A black goldfish did some kind of service for the yellow goldfish. I was not easily offended by these details. It's just a part of history. From what I understand, the new version has edited the scenes and even dubbed over some narration. I am satisfied with the quality of the original film. It is rather long for one sitting so as entertaining as it is do not expect children to sit through the whole film. It's a shame there are no other similar films with the same concept of taking classical orchestra music as a muse to create animation. The whole film can be seen online for free on you tube. Fantasia (1940) is the title. Enjoy.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I have never been a keen reader myself. I've been told about Robert's book by my father a few years ago and never had the urge to pick it up and read it. More recently a friend read the book, and reminded me of it. I bought the kindle version 2 days ago. Amazingly not really being a reader, I could not stop close this book since I started. I finished the book in 2 days, and already bought the second book this morning. I can see why this book has been on the best-seller list for the last 15 years. Suggest to everyone to do yourself the favour to read this. BRILLIANT is such an understatement. This was WAY beyond.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book, read it in 3 days. You just can't let it go. I give it four stars because I like the idea, the plot but I don't like the way it's written. It seems to me that the author could have done it much better, with more detailed explanations of the feelings and with more emotions.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Got for free off the app of the day, but easily worth the $$$. Easily finds computer using your google account.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I got this app to use with a 4 year old who is on the autism spectrum. The app looks andworks great on the Kindle Fire. I especially liked the pictures of happy/sad faces. They fit in with one of his goals of learning to recognize emotions on people's faces. We will get a lot of use out of this app. Thank you for making it available.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|This video was of great quality and the movie itself was a surprise. Only wish I had the theater popcorn to go with it.
B000679QK2|5.0|Genesis' 3-CD box set The Platinum Collection, which was released in November of 2004 in the UK and in September of 2005 here in the US, and (until its discontinuation in 2008 (for the US and Canada) in favor of the 2-disc version of Turn It On Again The Hits) was the best Genesis compilation available.<br />The three discs in this set contains 40 songs, many of them freshly remixed by Genesis engineer Nick Davis, and is close to four hours of music.<br />It also contains a 20-page booklet with an interview with Phil Coliins, Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks conducted by Hugh Fielder as well as the song titles and writing credits, what songs came from which albums, pictures of the album covers, and thank you's.<br />Prior to The Platinum Collection, there was the limp 18 track compilation Turn It On Again: The Hits (1999) (which was released in a superior 2-CD set in 2007). The 2 songs missing from that set here are \\"Congo\\" and \\"Carpet Crawlers 99\\" - no issue from me with these being omitted (they are on both versions of the Turn It On Again compilation).<br />Disc 1 was their most recent stuff from 1982 to 1997. We start with four tracks from the 1991 US Top 5 album We Can't Dance (their final album with Phil Coliins) which are \\"No Son of Mine\\", \\"I Can't Dance\\", \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" and \\"Hold on My Heart\\" which were all the big hits from the album. Then we had five tracks from 1986's Top 3 album Invisible Touch starting with the album's chart-topping title cut plus \\"Throwing It All Away\\", \\"Tonight Tonight Tonight (edited)\\", \\"Land of Confusion\\" and \\"In Too Deep\\" all of which were singles. Then the first five tracks from the 1983 Top 10 self-titled effort a/k/a The Shapes Album starting with the atmospheric UK smash \\"Mama\\", the US smash \\"That's All\\", the epic \\"Home By the Sea/Second Home By the Sea\\" (I count as one track but is split as two) and \\"Illegal Alien\\" (remixed for this collection)). Then from the UK 3 X 3 EP and the original US edition of the Top 10 album Three Sides Live we had the Top 30 hit \\"Paperlate\\" (here in a new 2005 remix). The first disc ends with the title cut from 1997's dud Calling All Stations (the band's final album).<br />Disc two covered 1976-81. We start with two tracks from 1981's US Top 10 album Abacab represented by the album's title cut and \\"Keep it Dark\\" (both of which were remixed for this collection) although some question why the album's other US hits \\"No Reply at All\\" and \\"Man on the Corner\\" are missing but appear on the off-shoot Video Show DVD (and the 2-CD Turn It On Again The Hits Tour Edition). Then we have four tracks from 1980's Duke which are \\"Turn it On Again\\", \\"Behind the Lines\\", \\"Duchess\\" and \\"Misunderstanding\\" (all are remixed except for Behind the Lines). The band's first US Gold selling Top 20 album, 1978's And Then There Were Three, featured three tracks which are \\"Many Too Many\\", \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" and \\"Undertow\\" (all here in remixed versions). 1977's Top 30 charting Wind and Wuthering is represented by three tracks which are \\"In That Quiet Earth\\", Afterglow\\" and \\"Your Own Special Way\\" (all here in remixed versions save Your Own Special Way). The band's first US Top 40 album A Trick of the Tail is represented by the title cut, \\"Ripples\\" and \\"Los Endos\\" (all remixed). Robbery Assault and Battery was also remixed but is on the off-shoot Video Show DVD.<br />Disc 3 is 80 minutes of Peter Gabriel era Genesis starting with three tracks from his finale with the band, 1974's The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway represented by the title cut, \\"Counting Out Time\\" and \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" (all here in remixed versions)). Then we have three tracks from 1973's Selling England by the Pound which are \\"Firth of Fifth\\", \\"I Know What I Like\\" and \\"The Cinema Show\\" (all remixed). Next is the 22-minute epic \\"Supper's Ready\\" from 1972's Foxtrot. Next is the 10 minute epic \\"The Musical Box\\" from 1971's Nursery Cryme (here in a remixed version). The 1970 album Trespass is represented by \\"The Knife\\" (here in a remixed version).<br />This collection may have only stalled at #100 in the US and no longer available in the US but sales and availability aside, this is a great start point for those who want to either discover Genesis or rediscover them in a new light with the remixing job on many of the tracks and a look back on one of rock's best bands.<br />RECOMMENDED!sion).

B006GG1KOC|5.0|This app is obviously for kids, but I enjoyed it as well. I like how the light bulb gives a hint about the category for the group of objects. Honestly stumped me on a couple! :-)
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I loaned out my original dvd, to a friend. It never came back so I ordered this one. This one will stay at home. I love stories with music.
B005OK722U|1.0|Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this movie... direct to DVD, the biggest \\"star\\" in it was Kip Pardue, not even a production credit from Eli Roth... but I had no idea it would be so aggressively stupid and just plain insulting to the intelligence of its audience. Hostel was popular not just due to its gore, but because it played on American fears of that dark and alien place that is eastern europe, as well as themes of xeno and homophobia. In short, it was torture porn that was smarter than it had any right to be and that is why it was such a success. Then along comes Hostel II with slightly less provocative gender themes, misogyny and one of the most disturbing and graphic death scenes to grace cinema theaters in a while. Now we have Hostel III, a movie that is so distant from its predecessors that, as I stated before, it's just plain insulting to viewers.  Hostel III follows the Elite Hunting Club's continued booming business of torture and murder, this time taking us to the U.S. (mistake number one) Las Vegas (what happens there stays there, get it?) to be precise, where club members not only get to indulge in acts of carnage, but also have the option of watching and even placing bets on the dismemberment. A group of guys, lead by hasbeen Kip Pardue (you know how I know he's a hasbeen? cause he's staring in Hostel III!) out celebrating their buddy's impending wedding. While this premise sounds mildly promising, it isn't, not even a little bit. This movie fails for one main reason: it betrays its source material completely and utterly. Even with the limited budget of a direct to DVD release, one would at least expect to see some decent gore and disturbing carnage, right? Think again, instead you'll be treated to some of the most bloodless and stupidest deaths you've ever seen.   Number one: a person does not die from having their face peeled off.   Number two: hissing cockroaches do not crawl into people's mouths by the hundreds to choke them to death.   Number three: why on earth is there an unrated version of this? I didn't see anything that was disturbing or horrific enough to even warrent a hard R rating. I'll tell you why, it's a sales gimmick.  It's crap like this that is so insulting, to think that this garbage's makers believed that they could piggy back off of decent horror films like Hostel and Hostel II, and try to sell audiences cheap toilet paper like this is just a slap in the face. The worst SAW movie is leaps and bounds better than Hostel III, which is a truly sad and accurate statement. I actually feel dumber for having watched this movie. Save yourself some angst and a few brain cells and skip this movie. Rewatch the first two instead.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Plain and simple buy this for anyone who you want to hear what a rock band sounds like. Great music, great lyrics and the recording is excellent.  I have become a fan and bought other FF CD's because of this one.  Dave and the boys rock!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a good game to pass time. My daughter likes to play the games also. Cant wait to unlock more games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game but they all rock they can be so hard but them they are so cool.I love it
B006MHWXMS|5.0|this application have helped me to organize my tasks at work, having each one different priority and deadline; this application needs only to handle sub-tasks in order to be a complete solution.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I play this game with my wife. its a good one to play on a calm night. we have a good time. overall opinion not too bad for Aa free game.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Some groups don't make sense as others have noted otherwise its great for kids and would get five stars gj
0439023521|5.0|I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!! Oh my gosh it's so good I highly recommend it!!! I rate it five stars!!!
B006GG1KOC|3.0|There is no way a little kid will get any of these past the first few levels. There's a lightbulb at the top that gives you the current theme for the set and some of them are ridiculous. Like organic, slice, and planet/satellite. Most adults don't even know what a satellite is. At least the satellite they are referring to.   3 stars because the level up noise was cute and made me laugh.
B0057R5G6E|3.0|The Jurassic Blu-ray trilogy is very nice, but the statue of the dinosaur isn't that great. I bought it as a collector, but mine arrived missing one finger of the T.rex hand and there are some flaws in paint application. I wish the people that made this thing had been more careful when packing it, because, i only saw the model after taking it of off the box and then I realized it was damaged. Probably Amazon won't replace it, since I can't ship it back from all across the world again, as I live in Brazil.
B005UBNL0A|2.0|Glad I didn't buy it, but I have a friend that did. He's been having problems with games and hardware since it is a truly unlocked core, you can really get yourself into a mess and your computer just won't run. Instead getting the Phenom II x6 1055T. I already own a system with it in it and have yet to come to an obstacle it cannot overcome.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|here's a challenge for those who think this is stupid ----try getting three flowers on all levels ---- let's see who's stupid now
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought this game was tough and pretty fun! You can earn points for almost anything you do! It is exciting and a great game for passing time.

0345529057|5.0|I purchased this series for my son for his birthday. He loves them! I received fast service, fast shipping, smooth transaction, and just in time for my departure to visit my son for his birthday. I was able to give them to him when I arrived. Thanks for the wonderful service guys. I would definitely purchase from you again.....
B006GG1KOC|2.0|This game froze my Kindle . I had to uninstall it. The game looked great, my four year old daughter liked it until it stopped responding.
B004XGN8W4|1.0|Gaming system arrived broken. I didn't realize this until quite some time later because I had to buy an HDMI cable before I found this out and because I'm deployed. The screen is so dark that the only way I can tell it is on is sound coming from the speakers. I turned up the brightness all the way and there is only a very faint light coming from the screen. Thanks for wasting my money and my time Intertech.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|I, like many others it seems, like the comfort. I thought my first stereo headphones, purchased way back when, were great because they blocked all outside sound; but they were very heavy. I selected these in part because they were light and because they did not have a 'closed-in' feeling; my preference is the 'open' sound as from speakers while avoiding the issue of room acoustics. My home recording studio is very small and even with acoustic treatment, good EQ and great monitors, these headphones still fill a necessary spot. The only downside is they are not super rugged construction. That said, I'd rather have great sound, light-weight and comfort as I'm not planning to just 'toss them around' so they should last forever.
140131046X|5.0|As with all Mitch Albom's books this book does not fail to make you laugh - cry and above all think.  A book to keep and re-read often just to remind you of it's lessons.  Thank you Mr. Albom.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|ok games... but keeps u going... wish it had better graphics and even controls. do not like thewhole point system though
B006GG1KOC|2.0|My daughter didn't like this game at all she is 4 years old and very advanced bit for her it wasn't fun at all.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is fun, relaxing, and brain stimulating all at the same time. It doesn't get much better than this.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Having watched this movie in Blu-ray and on DVD, I did not notice a significant difference of the movie quality or viewing experience with the Blu-ray. Given the difference in cost between Blu-ray and DVD, it is my opinion the extra cost for Blu-ray is not justified for this movie; DVD provides an equal quality movie experience. If you have the option to view DVD and Blu-ray, and cost is a higher factor, then I would suggest purchasing the DVD format of this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I would highly recommend this to most people. you get to play tons of games in one app. the most important thing is that you can get it for free.
B003L77GRO|5.0|If you missed the Fifth season you must get this set,,,,dont miss one !!!  Dexter is the best series ever.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are some great easy and challenging games to keep you busy for hours! I am really enjoying this app. and you cant go wrong with the price!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I gave this review 5 stars because I my son really enjoys this CD.  I bought is as a gift for him.  Otherwise I don't know much about it.  It did get shipped quickly and it arrived in great, new shape.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|good for ages 5 and under. would be a good tool for a babysitter or grandparent to use with child. good interactive game. would hold child's attention.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|on any home Pc or any apple product (ipad or iphone) you can see radar activity.  for the kindle fire, you get the absolute minimum layout. no radar, minimal information.  i would not recomend this app.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I just downloaded the game for my daughter to play with. After downloading it I decided to give it a try. It was rather easy to begin with but as I got further in the game I actually had to put my thinking cap on. I finished the game but wish the game play was a bit longer.
0307473473|4.0|I ordered this book thinking that it would be the unique wintry tree cover, but it came as the classic yellow and green covered edition. I would have appreciated some notice, but I wasn't disappointed at all.<br /><br />As for the content, the style of the writing isn't as accessible as I'd hoped; it's harder to get into, and the names are at times difficult to remember because of their foreign origin. However, the plot was absolutely riveting once I got into it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone in search of a unique and interesting story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really. fun app I enjoy playing it on the go and at home thank you very much
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I like the number of features that Evernote has and the number of programs that can be used with the app.

B000W91RUG|5.0|A friend told me about The Big Bang Therory and then the prior season DVD series. Looked everywheres locally for 1st four seasons. Amazon makes it so easy to order and receive. Really a perfect cast and so well written - really funny and love the DVD'S!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|almost done. sum of the them where way to easy. like the fishing one but overall not to shabby! XD
B005F9CPG8|5.0|A Beatles Album, was a last minute Christmas request by my grandson. Living in a rural area, online was my only hope.  We got it in a few days, in time, and it is a great album, thanks for saving the day for Grandma.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it works great!! its a lot of fun!!:) the only bad thing is how many apps there are... other than that, its amazing!!
0525478817|5.0|Each of John Green's books have affected my life with their subtle lessons. I've followed his work and his life for several years now, and it's pretty safe to say that he's my idol. I feel like you can appreciate his work without knowing a lot about John, but it's not the same. So if you don't know him, go to youtube.com/vlogbrothers.<br /><br />The key to a good book is finding yourself forgetting that you're not the main character. John Green makes it so you feel Hazel's pain, happiness, and fear. I know that everyone interprets art differently, but to me, A Fault in our Stars seems to be telling me that we can't allow the fact that we're all going to die some day ruin our lives.<br />Buy the book. I guarantee you'll fall in love with it.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|some of the stuff just doesnt make sense. needs better things to compare with each other, overall i would not recommend this game to anyone
B002WY65VU|5.0|This gory zombie movie is great! It has a few funny parts, but I would label it as a horror movie. Woody Harrelson plays a very cool character.
B006SV2LWA|1.0|Sad acting, lack of an original plot, totally predictable, etc....Good actors at their worst. Directing was lame. What a waste of what appears to have been a good budget.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I'm not bashing this game because of the fact it's meant for kids. I'm just irritated at the.stupid combinations that the developer used. Some of the more complex ones had more than one justifiable choice. I wouldn't let my kid play this. It's too complex and not simple and straightforward enough for children.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Great if you're bored!  Games are cheaply done, but it's nice for when you have some spare time to pass.  Doctor's offices, anyone?
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I thought &quot;How cute!&quot; And after downloading this game I took out my cognitive skills and showed this app that I meant business!  Oh and my three year old child liked the game as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I liked it cause well I'm 11 but some games are kinds hard and you need a certain amount of points to get a game.  **Note... this review was written by my 11 year old granddaughter.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is easy to use and has so many plans to choose from to keep you motivated to read, from a few days long to yearly plans!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|enjoyable games. generous with points earned to open new games. hours of fun for free! some games are more sensitive to the touch than others.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love the fact that it syncs all my notes regardless of what device I update the app from. Functionality is impressive. The interface is immediately intuitive. Simply put it's a great app.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Fun, but a bit to easy. Sure some levels may require a bit if thought but after about 5 minutes you are bound to get it, including the 3 stars. In fact, I've already got perfect on Buzz Box and I've had it for 24 hours. Besides that, it is a great game.
0062082353|4.0|This fascinating autobiography provides an interesting look at a Navy Seal sniper mostly after 9/11 as Chris Kyle serves several deployments in the Middle East Theater.  Adding to the insightful glimpse of the cost of his vocation is his wife Taya who brings a family member perspective to the memoir; as she explains the price they paid with him away for extended periods risking his life from enemy fire and having been shot twice.  Her segments add depth as they imply that Mr. Kyle's significant other is the SEALs.  Mr. Kyle admits he enjoyed his deadly work as he saw his mission was to save the lives of his brothers and sisters in arms; though two of his BFFs died.  His attitude sounds appalling but realistic as someone who watches buddies killed and maimed is going to be emotionally involved and that is why truck drivers don't serve as prison guards.  Although the memoir includes the non-combat life of the author like learning to shoot while hunting with his dad in Texas, it is the Mr. Kyle's military mission that hooks the audience though there is a lack of specificity and depth in the role of a sniper at war.  Still this is an engaging glimpse at how a person feels being a legally authorized \\"trained killer\\".<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B001LF3YQK|5.0|I love that this holds more wipes than some travel wipes case, it doesn't have to be refilled as often. I've never had a problem with wipes drying out as long as I remember to close it securely before putting it in the diaper bag. I also love the slide opening. I bought this over 2 years ago and it still looks and works like new. It matches perfectly with our Skip Hop Duo Double diaper bag (also amazing!). About 6 months ago, I switched to cloth wipes and this works well for that. I put dry cloth wipes in the case (fits 6-8 depending on how I place them in). I keep a peri bottle in the diaper bag with wipes solution and moisten the wipes when I'm ready to use them. Keeps the wipes and case mold free, great for the environment!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Excellent choices, very smart application. Freezes on Kindle Fire. Works better on iPhone 4S. Brilliant idea that is ahead of its time!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This was a gift, It was just what the person wanted. I've had no complaints and they seemed very content. Delivery was quick and even received a video credit as a bonus.BM

B001VNB54A|5.0|so realistic, I feel that I have a clue of what it what must have been like to go to war in that day.  Having read the books by the fighting men from which most of the material was taken, I could see how the movies were made.  Well written,  well filmed.  Outstanding.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great format, many free and downloadable translations, wonderful reading plan support built in.  My only disappointments are lack of Strong's (Hebrew and Greek) support and lack of devotional support (though admittedly that is not the focus of this app) .
B002BWP49C|5.0|this is such a great movie.. loved it.. would of seen it over and over in the theater if the prices werent so high... definatly a buyer..
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this is the best app to share between my iPad, iPhone, and Kindle Fire. Sharing documents with different operating systems. Droid and Apple. With the PC app its complete. Wonderful! Keep up the good work Evernote. I' m a big fan.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|\\"Listen: Billy Pilgrim has become unstuck in time.\\"<br /><br />And so it begins in the late Kurt Vonnegut's classic of American literature, [[ASIN:B003XVYLDU Slaughterhouse Five]], the absurdist masterpiece that this veteran of the 'Nam Era first read in college in the early '70s. It was a time when peace protests were spreading across the United States, and disillusionment was growing in the ranks of pour troops in Vietnam.<br /><br />And then in June of 1972, a photo appeared in newspapers across the country and around the world, an image of a young Vietnamese girl running down the road, her body scorched by napalm, her face contorted in pain. That photograph, taken by Associated Press photographer Nick Ut remains a haunting image of the American war in Vietnam. This photo became one of the most famous and memorable photos of Vietnam, and won Nick Ut the Pulitzer prize in 1972, and is the subject of [[ASIN:B001QIGZDG The Girl in the Picture]] by Denise Chong.<br /><br />Shortly after this photo had appeared in the news, I had read the section in this book where protagonist Billy Pilgrim had again become unstuck in time, and was seeing the firebombing of Dresden as if it was a movie being run backwards: \\"The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes.\\" And Vonnegut ran this scene, quickly backwards in time, with Billy Pilgrim extrapolating, all the way back to Adam and Eve.<br /><br />I made the mistake of reading these few passages about Dresden in my Contemporary American Literature class, and all hell broke loose, mostly because the impact of Nick Ut's famous photo was on everyone's mind and being discussed from many aspects. The class discussions rapidly turned away from the discussions on Kurt Vonnegut's contributions to science fiction writing and literature in general, and didn't stop until the class was over. So it goes.<br /><br />The concepts of free will and fate that Vonnegut raises here can be thought provoking in themselves, and the author is also capable of adding a bit of hilarity in places where it's least expected. Not wanting to interject any spoilers here, but Billy has been kidnapped in a flying saucer and is taken to the planet Trafalmadore. These extraterrestrials appear (to humans) like upright toilet plungers with a hand atop, into which is set a single, green eye. During the trip to Tralfamadore, Billy asked for something to read. Among their \\"five million Earthling books on microfilm,\\" the only actual book in English that they had was 'Valley of the Dolls' by Jacqueline Susann. \\"Billy read it, thought it was pretty good in spots. The people certainly had their ups and down, ups and downs.\\"<br /><br />There have been many analyses of this book, many reviews, and most of them are far more thought provoking than this reviewer is going to get into here. The characters that proliferate this book become three-dimensional as Billy Pilgrim bounces back and forth in time. Paul Lazzaro is a memorable and obsessive character who appears in a very crucial role, but to describe him further would be a spoiler. Billy meets adult film star Montana Wildhack on the planet Trafamadore, where they both share a space in a zoo there, and Billy does have some interesting dreams about her as well... we'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Vonnegut continually uses the refrain \\"So it goes.\\" This can appear when death or dying occur, as a transition to another subject, to explain what cannot be explained, and as comic relief. I heard or read somewhere that this appears over a hundred times, but I'm not counting. So it goes.<br /><br />Should note that the 1972 film [[ASIN:B0001FVDGY Slaughterhouse-Five]] is available on DVD, and it's as faithful a film adaptation as one could find for a book such as this. It'sexpertly directed by George Roy Hill, and Michael Sacks really becomes the character as Billy Pilgrim, and Sharon Ganz is perfect as his overweight, overprotective wife. Ron Leibman is quite good as the loony and obsessed Paul Lazzaro, and<br /><br />Was glad to find this in Kindle format, as my last two printed copies of this book were borrowed by friends who had promised to return them when they finished. One did say that she was \\"still working on it\\" a couple of years later, but that she was having a tough time following it, as Billy Pilgrim becoming \\"unstuck in time\\" was difficult for her to follow. So it goes.<br /><br />There are too many good Vonnegut books to recommend here, and this reader has read almost all of those by this author. Some, like [[ASIN:B002QJZ9T0 Palm Sunday: An Autobiographical Collage]] might appeal to diehard Vonnegut fans more than those just beginning to explore his works. In Chapter 18 of that book, the author graded his own works, and some of them are as follows:<br /><br />* Player Piano: B<br />* [[ASIN:B00133811I God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater]]: A<br />* [[ASIN:B003XREM5G The Sirens of Titan]]: A<br />* [[ASIN:B002KJA97I Mother Night]]: A<br />* [[ASIN:B003XRELGQ Cat's Cradle]]: A+<br />* [[ASIN:B003XVYLDU Slaughterhouse Five]]: A+<br />* Welcome to the Monkey House: B-<br />* Happy Birthday, Wanda June: D<br />* [[ASIN:B005IHWAN0 Jailbird]]: A<br /><br />In each of these grades, this reader will agree, and most if not all can be found here.

B0064NTZJO|5.0|Must see. Saw it twice. Listened to the album at least 100 times already. The movie is beautifully shot and music is cool and riveting.
0061433063|5.0|I loved this book.  Now, I am a big Pratchett fan, and with some exceptions, have enjoyed most of this books.  The main reason I am writing this review, however, is to say that most of the Tiffany books are aimed at a younger crowd.  They are good- and I enjoyed them, but they hold back on a bit of the tougher opinions that Pratchett sometimes expresses.  This one does not hold back and is, in my opinion, appropriate for a little later age group than the previous ones.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for a couple of weeks now on my Kindle Fire. It works beautifully and I love the reading plans. It helps hold me accountable and allows me to &quot;catch up&quot; with the touch of a button. I love. the option to have potions read to me. I find this useful on mornings where I run out of time. I simply take my kindle with me to my next task and let it read the remaining portion to me.
0062011847|5.0|I enjoy reading Pratchett.  His opinions and moralizing are part of his writing which I have frequently described as \\"social commentary\\" disguised as fantasy humor.  This book is a bit stronger on the social cometary than most.  It has not-so-veiled references to the plight of various indigenous people, the limitations of the law and the need of people to take care of business themselves and other such themes that are common to Pratchett's work.  I love this stuff, enjoy all - well OK, MOST - of his characters and found this to be a good, fun, know what you are going to get kind of read.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|Nice design. Looks just like a book when closed, so it's pretty nice to carry around. It just needs a stand feature and it would be perfect.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|he loves this movie and amazon offered it at the best price so i got it for him for christmas.
B000JQTWPO|5.0|I happened upon The Moonstone by accident, never heard of it before.  I was so pleasantly surprised by the superb writing, the can't-put-it-down story, the twists and turns, the humor.  This is one of the best books I've ever read.  Heartily recommend for any reader, especially one who likes detective stories, great characters, and subtle humor.
0800141660|5.0|The BEST version of Jane Austen's novel,but I happen to love Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant. The love and care between the sisters is beautifully done.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read the reviews for thjs book and almost didn't buy it.  Prepared for dissappointment,  I was quite surprised by being just as completely engrosed in it as I was with  the other two books.  Someone mentioned they thought the book lost Katmiss' perspective; I do not agree at all.  Others were unhappy at its ending, so again I expected the worst.  Once again, I was more than happy with the direction of the story and its ending.  I'm sorry I'm finished with the series; it took me 3 weeks to complete them.  I was completely rivited and loved these  books.
0385341679|5.0|When I first started this series I had no idea how much of an addiction it would become. By far the best series I have ever read, it was one hell of a roller coaster ride and Shadowfever the fifth  book to the Fever series lived up to it. I devoured the almost 600 page book. Every free moment that I had Shadowfever was in my hands and there were several times I lost track of time.<br /><br /> It was wrapped up very well and left me very satisfied as a reader. Shadowfever was full of surprises, I didn't see any of it coming. There were a lot of minor characters from the previous books that you find out actually played bigger roles than you thought in the grand scheme of things, and the ending well I never would have expected it. So many lies and secrets surface in this book making it a thrilling and engaging read.<br /><br />After reading the Fever series I have become a huge fan of Moning and will pretty much pick up anything she writes. I am so glad to know she will be writing  two more books to the series later on. Right now I'm excited to read her new trilogy coming out Fever World which will be a spin off of Fever with some key characters such as Dani, Christian, and Ryodan. But I will anxiously be waiting for the sixth and seventh book to the Fever series which wont be coming out for a few very long years because I would love nothing more then to dive back into the lives of Mac and Barrons.<br />If you haven't picked up this series yet ...what are you waiting for?

B0054JZC6E|5.0|A very nice variety of games. You will never get tired of all of these games. I would like to see more.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Wow, I read the 1 star reviews and those people are mean.  Seriously, this app is for toddlers and my 2 year old likes it.  And for the record, I do let my two year old use my Kindle Fire because I choose to do so. For the reviewer that said to spend time with your kids and teach them yourself instead of letting these types of games teach them...well, obviously that person doesn't have kids. Any parent will tell you that sometimes you need an hour of downtime to stay sane.  These types of apps are perfect for that. They don't keep the child engaged for a long period of time, but long enough to take a shower or cook dinner, and personally, I'd rather have my child play with my Kindle and actually, possibly, learn something rather than sitting in front of the TV or playing stupid video games. Rate the app fairly and leave your personal opinion out of it.  And, to respond to the other reviewer that wants more adult apps...I say no, I like the kids apps better. I have better things to do than play games all day, but my son and I enjoy playing the kids apps and reading the ebooks together.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is perfect for protecting the Fire.  The main feature I wanted in a case was a slim profile.  I take the Fire to work in a small pocket in my backpack and didnt want to buy anything that would stop me from doing this.  The initial reviews for this product were poor, so I held off of buying a case.  I could not find another one that was as slim as this so I bought it and would judge it myself.  This case has a very slim profile, adding minimal bulk to the Fire which is exactly what I wanted.  Construction is excellent with the Fire fitting snugly into the case with no wiggle.  The built in stand takes a little while to work perfectly.  The case cover needs to be broken in a little to get the stand to sit right, especially at the cover hinge.  Once that occurs, it works great, even easily allowing you to type with the Fire propped up. I have no complaints and would recommend this case to anyone.

0439813786|5.0|Loved it from the second I picked it up.  Most pages are drawings but there is a good deal of text considering its 2+\\" thick.  Without knowing the story but knowing a movie has been made about this story I chanced buying it for my 8 year old boy who is a good reader.  He read it at his own will over school vacation and calls it the best book ever.

It feels as though you are sitting in an IMAX theater.  What a wonderful story about friendships, love and family.  I highly recommend this to anyone who really loves this film.

145162445X|5.0|\\"'A Universe From Nothing: Why There is Something Rather Than Nothing' is The fait accompli defeat of the 'argument from design' by the pugilistic physicist and outspoken atheist, Lawrence M. Krauss. As fellow astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson recently affirmed, \\"God is an ever-receding pocket of scientific ignorance that is getting smaller and smaller all the time.\\" And after imbibing Krauss's tour de force treatise against 'intelligent design,' the pocket indeed just got a whole lot smaller. Religion and its apologists will undoubtedly dismiss it with facile nostrums, but science and nontheists finally have the coup de grace case against a prime mover at the cosmological level, thanks to the incandescent and intrepid professor Krauss.\\"
B004GYY714|4.0|This app is way better than pandora and all of the other BIG music apps.  Only one bad thing, it buffers too much
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I really like some of the games, but you have to play them over and over and over and over again in order to get enough points to unlock the next game. Then play them some more to unlock another and so on and so on. It gives me something to do when I'm bored, but that's about it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are fun, but still difficult.  Graphic quality isn't incredible, but this game strikes as one that isn't going for quality so much as quantity.  The pop-up ads are obtrusive and are really aiming at the wrong market (I'm a teen&ndash;why do I need a house buying app?).  Also, it seems to advertise itself as having 117 games for free, but you have to earn points and 'buy' the games.  Still, some of the early on games are quite fun.  As you go on the games are more expensive, but I cant really tell you if they're worth the gameplay.
B005ELZKWS|4.0|Big VH fan.  Big Hagar fan.  Big Satch Fan.  Big RHCP Fan.  So Biased I am.  This is a really good cd.  But not as fun as the first release.  I really like it.  And musically it's excellent.  Excellent production.  Just that the songs are not there as much for me.  Do I love it?  Of course.  And based on VH the last um 15 years???  Is it that long?  This is far better.  This is a full sounding band of bombastic rock and roll.  Fun stuff.  If you liked the first then you really are not going to lose anything by getting this.  You will still wish more bands made this music when it's over.

B006MQRLSA|4.0|MONEYBALL is gathering a lot of acclaim as an Oscar potential contender on several levels, so much so that for those who have little interest in baseball in general have overcome that inertia and have watched this film primarily out of devotion to the work of Brad Pitt.  For this viewer the film is long on tedium, lacking in excitement and character involvement and focusing on the financial background of a sport that is supposed to be for the pleasure of the public. Yes, there are moments of interest in the concept of building a team based on saving money by hiring players who by statistics realized on a computer program show potential for building a solid team (as opposed to scouting for popular 'names' with the public and the media). These moments are underlined by the strong performance of Jonah Hill as Peter Brand, the Yale Economics graduate who comes up with `the concept'.<br /><br />The story is based on Michal Lewis' book `Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game' and adapted for the screen by Stan Chervin, Aaron Sorkin and Steven Zaillian.  Bennett Miller directs.  The story is basically a docudrama about the Oakland Athletic's  General Manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) who is faced with the loss of the best payers of his team to scouts from other clubs with bigger dollars. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team.<br /><br />Oakland A's GM Billy Beane is handicapped with the lowest salary constraint in baseball. If he ever wants to win the World Series, Billy must find a competitive advantage. Billy is about to turn baseball on its ear when he uses statistical data to analyze and place value on the players he picks for the team. The rest of the film is a push pull game played in the boardroom, with the manager (Philip Seymour Hoffman), and with certain players (Chris Pratt, Stephen Bishop et al). Tossed in for some reality testing is Billy's daughter Casey (Kerris Dorsey), ex-wife (Robin Wright), and a few encounters with reappearing people.<br /><br />The idea for the film is solid but it wears thin because it is so insular to Oakland.  The fact that it is a true story (with a less than satisfying ending) probably will attract some viewers.  It certainly is not Brad Pitt's best role to date, not does the film seem that it will have much holding power.  But, if you are a fan of baseball it just may ring your chimes.

B000SFZ05C|3.0|A huge fan here.  A lifer if you will.  This was a let down for me.  Big time.  Yes there are some good songs in the mix.  But It's overall a bloated release.  It's 4 very talented people and a great producer and the sum of the parts don't equal what they should have.  It's very hard for me to describe.  But I guess if Duran Duran went metal this would be what I would expect sound wise.  That's horrible to say or even a solid description.  But this to me was a die hard only release.  And what is surprising is that the band themselves have turned their backs on Beyond Good and Evil but embrace this.  I don't know.  I thought beyond was much better than this.  I can say that the releases they have done since in those capsules give me high hopes again.   Buy if you are a fan or you get it cheap.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|LOVED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS!! Couldn't hardly put them down. This one was NOTHING like them.  Spoiler alert!  Most of the book was pointless! They went through and the whole capital and got tons of there crew killed for nothing!! they didn't even get to the capial center before the rebels got there then they didn't even make it to the mansion before she got hurt. I felt like I had read that whole section for nothing!! When Prim died I didn't even get that she died. I had to read it over and over. Still don't get it really. Not until later on when she goes over it again. It all felt really rushed. Like she just wanted it to be over. \\"The war is over......blah, blah, blah, and now she only has peter so she loves him. the end. oh yea....she has 2 kids.\\" I just feel unfinished. That's just too bad....Maybe they will make it into a movie and they will fix it then.

B004ZNAGNE|2.0|First off, just so you know where I'm coming from, I first heard DSOTM whilst playing cards with the next-door neighbor on their picnic table the summer after it was originally released.  So much for dating myself.  Throughout the years, I've owned vinyl, cassette, and CD versions of, and have read and watched numerous interviews and documentaries regarding this seminal work.  I am somewhat familiar with it.  I received the 'Experience Version' as a birthday present from a dear, life-long friend.  If you disagree with my opinions, fine.  But if you choose to ding me with an \\"unhelpful,\\" I'd hope and appreciate you to be as honest and sincere as I'm trying to be here, and back it up with a helpful explanation as to why.  The studio remaster:  I really wanted, and had every expectation, of this being the best yet issue of The Dark Side Of The Moon.  I gave this disc an intensively critical listen on a Denon AVR-3803, linked by SPDIF from the players, to high-end stereo speakers (with dual 15-inch LF drivers) I've had from since back-in-the-day (1980).  By critical I mean directly A-B'ing the disc with each of two other versions I have--first the 1986 EMI rev 0 mastering, then the 2003 30th Anniversary remaster.    As \\"Breathe\\" began, it was immediately obvious to me that something was missing, and something was there that shouldn't be, especially when compared to the 1986 version.  First, what shouldn't be there: Although it's apparent that there is more overall energy in the low end, I also notice a distinct muddiness to it.  Instead of being just more punchy, it's as if a broad mid-bass boost has been applied to the entire mix.  Where there was once space between Waters' bass and Wright's keys, there's now a dull wash that muddles them together.  Worse than the mud, though, is how a lot of the high frequency content seems to have been pushed to the background.  Mason's hi-hat and ride cymbals are all but buried throughout much of the recording, and the crash cymbalsare often harsh, even breaking up at times, as if they were improperly noise-gated.  Finally, the airy openness of the vocals has also gone missing, most regrettably from Clare Torry's iconic performance on \\"The Great Gig In The Sky.\\"  In fact, there's a disappointing lack of 'air' over the entire disc.  It seems to me that the Dark Side of the Moon is growing darker with each generation.  James Guthrie also did the remaster on the 30th Anniversary SACD edition.  The stereo version, at least, of that disc too is lacking in brightness compared to the 1986 version, but not nearly as much as this one.  Maybe he's been gradually losing his low frequency hearing, and as a result is unknowingly compensating by over-EQ'ing the bottom end and cutting the highs?  Maybe we're only getting 2.0 channels of an upcoming 'super-mega-ultimate 5.1 remaster?'  Who knows.  I can only say that the result here sounds stifled, even claustrophobic, to me.  It's not all bad, and there are parts where it works.  Dick Parry's sax solos on \\"Money\\" and \\"Us And Them\\" are pleasingly less shrill, as are the choruses on the latter.  But this treatment could have/should have been done on a channel-by-channel basis, without meddling with the overall mix.  Unless the original source tapes have just degraded that much since 1986, with the audio tools available to today's studios, there's absolutely no excuse that this should not have been a truly stellar Experience.  DSOTM deserves far better.  1 star for this disc.  The Wembley disc:   Gilmour's vocals are generally solid... don't really understand why they felt the need for a harmony vocal on the verses on \\"Time.\\"  Whatever.  I looked forward to his guitar solo on \\"Time,\\" and he does not disappoint.  Aside from a possible reluctance to be adventurous toward the bridge end of the neck, it has all of the power and conviction of the studio version. Unfortunately, his protracted noodlings during \\"Money\\" and \\"Any Colour You Like\\" get to drag and meandera bit, and often seem forced if not uninspired, especially when contrasted to some of the earlier live bootlegs I've heard in the past.  Waters' bass sounds rather anemic at times... especially noticeable on \\"Money.\\"  His performance also seems inconsistent, suggesting he's just not that in to it.  Mason seems to kind of fall asleep in the middle of \\"Money\\" during Gilmour's improv (can't say I completely blame him :-b ), but is his naturally energetic and accurate self otherwise when he needs to be.  Wright is top notch, providing the oft-understated yet vital piano and keyboard underpinnings to the Pink Floyd sound, without ever screaming \\"hey, look at me!\\"  I also enjoyed Parry's alternate sax solos--really wish they'd extended them.  \\"The Great Gig In The Sky:\\" Well, what can you say, \\"It's about dying.\\"  On the plus side, 'The Blackberries' didn't even presume to try to duplicate Torry.  But then maybe The Floyd might have splurged a little and hired a third backing vocalist who could've at least approximated her passionate fury and soulfulness, instead of sounding like they were in the final throes of death themselves?  On balance, though, a much better live disc, both performance-wise (save TGGITS) and sonically, than I'd expected based on some of the reviews I've read.  3+ stars for this disc.  Bottom line: I am greatly irritated with the studio remaster, and what it should have been.  IMHO, a re-release has to improve on all previous releases in order to be considered more than just a cash grab.  If you're going to buy this, buy it for the live Wembley performance... though twenty-four bucks is a strain to swallow for that alone.

B006UAWH2S|5.0|The ineluctably disturbing aspects of \\"Perfect Sense\\" linger long after the movie ends.  \\"Perfect Sense\\" is a poetic thriller that forces people to make sense of a world that is literally stripped of all its sensibilities.  Slowly, one sense is lost, then another, across the world, and the viewer becomes directly involved in sly and clever ways.  Will vision be lost next?  And then what?  How much more can possibly be lost?  Ewan McGregor is satisfyingly atmospheric and Eva Green's dramatic starts and stops provide genuine intrigue.  One can only hope that should the world end this way, and if we could possibly survive the perceptual annihilation, that we could once and for all come to our senses about how we treat each other and never lose sight of what really matters to us.

0765365278|4.0|Brandon Sanderson can write.  He crafts an interesting story with interesting characters set in an interesting world. The three main characters and the three associated story lines are terrific, well conceived, well written and well told.<br /><br />Characters:  I loved them all, especially some of the \\"side\\" characters like Szeth the Truthless and Wit. Well thought out and believable.<br />Dalinar is a fascinating character, as he wrestles with the meaning of his existence in a world full of confusing and misguided motivations.<br />The same for Kaladin.  Bad things happen to good and noble people. It is fascinating to watch Kaladin as his world unravels...then unravels some more...then some more.<br />And the same for Shallan (and Jasnah). Interesting characters with conflicted motivations and believable struggles.<br /><br />World Building:  Fantastic. As good as any. Everything you'd want.  Sanderson builds a world with a gripping history, mixed cultures (and motivations) social hierarchies, etc. A great backdrop to the story.<br /><br />Story: Compelling, interesting, perhaps a bit dragged out (I'll touch on this in a bit). The stories of these three main characters maintain interest, perhaps that has a lot to do with the characters being interesting.<br /><br />Moral Value: If you're looking for voyeuristic, graphic and vulgar sex scenes that are in reality the authors own fantasies being played out in print (looks squarely at Kay, Martin, Bakker) then you won't like this book, because there is none.  Personally, I'm tired of modern fantasy authors being compared to Tolkien when he managed to tell the greatest of fantasy stories with no vulgarity and modern fantasy authors seem unable to write a page without incorporating their deviant sexual fantasies. I really don't want to know what Kay fantasizes about although he is sure to tell us in his stories.<br />I'm no prude.  I understand that a story about King Arthur cannot be told without crossing that bridge.  The same would go for a story about King David.  But if you've read any of the authors mentioned above, you know exactly what I mean.<br />Sanderson tells an extraordinary story without degrading the reader with unnecessary sexual fantasies.  I appreciated that...greatly.<br /><br />Here's my one issue...the fat in the story.  As written, the story is over 1200 pages.  The story has a lot of fat that could have been trimmed, scenes that repeat an already illustrated point etc.  This story could have lost a considerable amount of it's pages and been equally compelling and lost none of the character development.<br /><br />That said, I still highly recommend this book if you dig great fantasy.  I'm looking forward to the next book.  Can't wait to reunite with Kaladin, Dalinar and Shallan.you've read any of the authors mentioned above, you know exactly what I mean.

Just the blocks, birds, pigs, and slingshot make it worth my purchase.
B004OBQDHK|4.0|I absolutely love this movie. I'm a giant Keanu Reeves fan, so I might be a bit bias, but how can you not like a movie about surf-boarding FBI agents who jump out of airplanes and have sex with dykes? All of the actors do really well for their roles, even if what a lot of what's said is cheesy.  As for the Blu-Ray experience, the movie goes straight to the Blu-Ray menus (no un-skippable previews and you can skip each opening logo sequences by hitting 'next chapter'). The picture quality itself is nice, but definitely not up to par with the Blu Rays of today (which is to be expected from a 20-year-old film). There are some noticeable flaws in the audio when turned up loud as well. Bonus features are limited, being only one disc, but include all the standard ones (deleted scenes, behind the story, theatrical trailer) and definitely add more value to the purchase. The Blu-Ray box used is one of those environmentally-friendly boxes with the recycle logo cut out of the plastic on the inside; this isn't a problem for most people but for me it feels really cheap when I pick it up, so I used one of my empty backup Blu-Ray cases for it instead of the included one.  Overall this is a perfect 90s action movie and the price is right, so I would certainly recommend it.
B002S0OBMS|4.0|I was lucky enough to be born to a woman who loves Andrew Lloyd Webber's music, so I have been listening to Phantom tunes since I was toddling. I am one of the \\"phans\\" who WAS eagerly awaiting a sequel, and although I run the risk of people derisively muttering \\"phan fic,\\" I like the Love Never Dies storyline, plot holes and all, because it is almost exactly they way I would have written it.   The Coney Island Waltz is a grand musical spectacle and is just right for a story set in this location - it has the right mix of romantic melody and underlying sense of potential danger; the excitement of Coney Island mixed with the morbid fascination with the \\"freaks.\\"   I find \\"Giry Confronts the Phantom\\" quite powerful and passionate, but I do find Giry's changing accent a bit jarring. Sometimes she rolls her 'rs,' sometimes she doesn't. It just sounds a bit odd to me.   \\"The Aerie\\" is, to me, a beautiful lead-in to the Phantom's first big number in Love Never Dies. I believe it's the musical equivalent of the creative process - you can hear the thoughts, then the burst of an idea, then the realisation that it doesn't work.   \\"Til I Hear You Sing\\" is the standout, in my opinion. It's the perfect example of Lloyd Webber's talent for creating beautiful melodies. Lyrics wise, I preferred this recorded version over the amended lyrics, eg. I found \\"empty air\\" made sense to me, while \\"cold, night air\\" seems a tad obvious. Likewise, \\"I ache, down to the core\\" sounded fine to me but \\"deep in my core\\" sounds to me as though the audience might not have realised that the Phantom was talking about his own core! So far I have enjoyed every recording I've heard, although Ramin Karimloo has been my favourite Phantom since I saw him in the original in 2009. He is young, but to me he becomes the Phantom; he makes me stop believing that he's a performer playing a role.  \\"Beneath A Moonless Sky\\" tells the story of the night that the Phantom and Christine spent together. Again, I prefer the original lyrics to the Australian version, although I have seen our production and loved it. The CD version I think has a mystery about it; the Australian version - the introduction to the song - I find a bit odd, as though it's a rushed attempt to explain to people new to the Phantom story how they've ended up here. I do love the melody though.  \\"The Beauty Underneath\\" is more of a Rock number which I think brings a bit of adrenalin to the show. Gustave's sweet singing shows how enchanted he is by the Phantom's dark, mysterious world.   I wouldn't like \\"Bathing Beauty\\", if it was a stand-alone song, simply because I don't like the vaudeville sound. However, in this context, it works. The Phantom, without his muse, has been reduced to writing catchy, but ultimately silly songs for Meg to sing. If you look at it this way, it becomes a bit of light hearted fun.   The title number, \\"Love Never Dies\\" was taken from another show. Having never seen whatever it is, I'm not bothered that it is a \\"recycled\\" tune. Sierra Boggess has a beautiful voice and anunciates properly, so I can actually hear what she's singing rather than just pretty, garbled notes. I would have preferred the climax, so to speak, to be right at the end of the song instead of it trailing off to a quiet \\"love lives on.\\" It's because of this, I think, that it's more effective on the emotions to see the song performed in the show, where you can see Christine looking between the Phantom and Raoul, whereas in the recording it just sounds like an opera diva singing a nice love song.    The lead-in to \\"Why Does She Love Me\\" is the melody from \\"Beneath A Moonless Sky\\" which I interpret as the relationship between Christine and the Phantom still hanging over Raoul's head. WDSLM itself is a beautiful, heart-breaking song, and despite Raoul's angry demands for another drink, I find myself empathising with him far more than I do in the original musical. He is no longer the dashing young knight who I was scathing of, he is an ordinary man with human emotions and problems.  There are many more songs on this soundtrack which are catchy and/or sweet (\\"Look With Your Heart\\", \\"Once Upon Another Time\\", \\"Devil take The Hindmost\\" - which is a welcome return to the Phantom's dark, competitive nature) but the few I have described are the ones which really stand out, for me.   Overall, despite the few quirks in the plot, the music is beautiful, and I rate it among Lloyd Webber's best, basing my decision on his other musicals which only have one or two songs I actually enjoy. If you don't like the plot or the lyrics, maybe seek out instrumental versions and try to appreciate the music alone, because most of it is truly beautiful.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|I was very skeptical when Toy Story 3 was first announced. I didn't like the second one all that much and was afraid they were going to milk the series to make a quick buck. I couldn't have been more wrong when I saw it in theaters. This is one of the best if not THE best 3D animated film of all time. The animation was spectacular, the voice acting was bar-none, and the story was just whimsical enough to retain that Toy Story charm and serious enough to capture the interest of viewers outside the prime target demographic age group. I can't remember getting that close to tears in any other film!  After loving my first viewing so much, I went all-out on getting my own copy and bought the 2-disc Blu-Ray + DVD/Digital copies. The box physically feels packed with content, which made me feel a little bit better about spending $30 on one movie. The Blu-Ray feature film disc looks and sounds superb, and even the DVD copy looks crisp and clean on big TVs. I'll probably never get through all the content on the bonus features disc, but I ensure you it is a Toy Story fanatic's wet dream. My only complaint is the iTunes copy it comes with, which is in standard definition and is bloated to almost 1.5g with all of Apple's DRM. When your iPod only holds 6.7g of storage, the 1.5 packs quite a punch! I ended up going to a torrent site and getting the same quality .mp4 file at a third of the size, which is really something a paying customer should not have to do.  Overall though this movie makes for a great children/family movie as well as a great addition to any collector of animated films or well-done Blu-Ray releases. Highly recommended!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|\\"The Pacific\\" follows the fortunes of the 1st Marine Division as it fights its way across the north-western Pacific, clearing the Japanese Army from the many tiny islands in the region in what were probably some of the most intense, brutal and physically and mentally sapping batles of the second world war. It is based largely on the memoirs of two of the characters, [[ASIN:0091937515 Robert Leckie's Helmet for my Pillow]] and [[ASIN:0091937523 Eugene Sledge's With the Old Breed]].<br /><br />The series, which ran during 2010, comprises of ten episodes, and they cover four of the major encounters of the campaign (Guadalcanal, Pelelieu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa) as well as the Division's time in Melbourne. The Pacific proves, conclusively in my opinion, that a) the war movie is not dead and b) it is not necessarily cheapened by the TV series format. Billed as a sister series to [[ASIN:B003YCOIFO Band Of Brothers]], and produced by Spielberg and Hanks, it does, of course beg the comparison with its predecessor and with justification; The Pacific displays, gloriously, that impeccable heritage in its vision and execution.<br /><br />The first point of note is the camera work which is magnificent with majestic, sweeping pans to show the wide picture of the battles and urgent, vital close-ups which put the viewer right into the ball-clenching centre of some unspeakably frightening battle scenes. These battles are wonderfully choreographed and if you can imagine the Omaha landing scene from [[ASIN:B003LVZYL0 Saving Private Ryan]], reproduced many times over and on a bigger scale, you will have some idea of how these scenes come across. The attention to detail and historical accuracy is jaw-dropping. It would perhaps be a little crass to mention the cost, but it is easy to understand why The Pacific, at $200m, was at the time (and still is?) the most expensive television series ever created by any network. The money was well spent!<br /><br />It is inevitable that a subject such as this will rely heavily on CGI to fill in the historical spaces between actors and props, particularly during the battle scenes. These scenes seem to have a slightly sepia-toned look which may be there, in part, to blur the edge between CGI and live action. It lends a slightly unreal, computer game look to the wider battle scenes (such as the amphibious landings which involved a huge number of ships).<br /><br />The acting is also exemplary. With such a large cast and enormous stage it is difficult to keep track of the characters (at least to begin with) and indeed to recognise them at all in the heat of the battle scenes but the individuals nevertheless come across well and there are some deeply moving performances. One word of criticism is that little attention is paid to the Japanese protagonists. It would clearly be hard to cover all bases equally but for the most part the \\"Japs\\" are no more than extras to be mown down in enormous swathes. This is of course a reasonably accurate reflection of their role (at least to western eyes) during the war itself but perhaps enough time has passed that a more intimate and sympathetic view would be warranted (see, for instance, [[ASIN:B000Q6ZM2E Letters from Iwo Jima]]).<br /><br />One other minor complaint is that the storyline is interrupted by an entire episode set during R&R in Australia and focusing largely on the characters' amorous relationships with the locals. Obviously this happened in real life and it is of some historical interest but it fractures the flow somewhat. It is tolerable, but a little irritating.<br /><br />In summary this is a sumptuous war drama that will sit proudly, alongside BoB or by itself, as a fitting tribute to the achievements of a dying breed. It is only a shame that we in the UK cannot provide a similar tribute to our own grandfathers.as this will rely heavily on CGI to fill in the historical spaces between actors and props, particularly during the battle scenes.

B005XN0SGU|5.0|I'm loving this for reading cbr files! Totally worth the $3 and so far everything's working really well. I hope it continues.<br />----<br />UPDATE:<br />Wow, over a week later and I'm caught up with The Walking Dead. This is a GREAT app and I had very few issues with it. Sometimes navigating to your documents can get wonky, but once as your in the right folder, the program always remembers where you left off. It's very easy to jump from one cbr file to the next by just tapping the the bottom corner of the screen.<br /><br />I tried reading the first issue of the Walking Dead on the Comixology app and I wasn't liking it.

I haven't used other comic viewers like Comicat, but I can say that Perfect Viewer really works well for me.

For $0.99 it's worth the buy if you are going to be no-where-near a wifi or 3g signal and you want a super-quick read about minimizing or to give yourself a kick in the but to down size the amount of stuff you have.<br /><br />Unless you're on a plan or a train I'd recommend just reading the blogs.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this app is well designed and has great graphics. I would put the age range as 2-4years old, although some of the harder ones would probably stump a 6-7 year old. thanks, amazon, for providing another quality FAotD

0307454541|5.0|The only thing that I do not like about the Millennium Trilogy is that the author, Stieg Larsson, has passed away and cannot continue writing books of this caliber. I was completely addicted to these books, and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo was my favorite.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I picked up the sample on the Kindle app for my iPad and was intrigued enough.  What I most enjoyed is that the foreshadowing, while seeming so obvious at the time, often lead to both the expected and the unexpected.  I can see that the book is more suited for a teen reader than an adult but as a casual commute worthy read, this 20-something would gladly read this story again. I loved the story telling and the part I loved the most was flipping past the last word of the story and finding out all the photographs are real authentic vintage photos found through archives, yard sales and flea markets by a few collectors.  I don't know if the story was written to suit the photos or if the photos were chosen to fit the story but I thought that was such a neat touch.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|has lots of games but the games are rather poorly made and have sluggish controls. still fun though and is a great game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Super easy. Tons of translations. If you're giving this less than five stars, you must be waiting for version 2 where James Earl Jones reads whichever translation you choose.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|An absolutely addicting game! Quell Reflect is different levels than Quell, with a nice tutorial for new players, so you don't need to play Quell to appreciate Quell Reflect, although both are lovely. Easily five stars, a great, relaxing game.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the most brilliantly crafted books I've ever read. It's now one of my top five favourite books ever, and one that I will reread in the future. I have not loved a book this deeply since We, the Drowned by Carsten Jensen and The Red Tent by Anita Diamant.  John Green has created a cast of characters that are so honest and relatable that by the end of the book, I felt like I knew them personally. The book focuses primarily on three young people with cancer-Hazel, Augustus (Gus), and Isaac. They know that they have a raw deal, but they're not overly bitter about their situations. They're still teenagers, they just happen to have their eyes wide open to the reality of human mortality. I found Isaac particularly endearing, watching him learn that promises are flimsy and so is young love.  The storyline of The Fault in Our Stars isn't predictable. It's hard not to begin reading a cancer book wondering who will die and when, but the arc of the plot wasn't what I thought it was going to be. I like that I couldn't see exactly where it would go-it made things interesting. At the same time, Green leaves the reader with no illusions about what these characters will face. Some of them are living on borrowed time and will definitely not make old bones.  The Fault in Our Stars does have its share of sad moments, but these aren't gratuitous. It's a beautiful kind of agony, watching these characters confront the basic truths of mortality that we all will eventually face ourselves. I don't cry easily (only two other books have ever brought me to tears), but this book really moved me and I mourned for the lives of these characters when the novel ended.  The Fault in Our Stars covers not only what it means to be dying, but what its like to grieve for someone who has died. Watching the decline of a character and then the aftermath for those left behind made me think, This person is amazing! Why didn't he/she get more life? Which then led me to wonder, Would he or she havebeen such a great person if illness hadn't made them reexamine and value life?   Augustus and Hazel are big on existential questions like that. John Green got me wondering about these things too-testament to a good novel, that it can invade my thinking like that.  Read The Fault in Our Stars. Yes, it is a sad book, but the insight and appreciation for life that you will gain from reading it far outweighs a few tears.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The movies are good, im sure you've all seen them. The special features present on other dvds are not present here. On top of that. The packaging is horrendous. 8 dvds in one case. Jammed in there. Ideally each movie would have its own case, but 2 movies a case would have also been acceptable. 8 dvds in one case is just ridiculous, as box sets are often made for collectors, this is a big deal. You want a good box set, you can get the first 5 movies in a big collectors case(looks like a little suitcase, comes with lots of other cool little trinkets and whatnot), for only 20 dollars on amazon right now. If only the same amount of effort was made with this collection.

I will buy this planner again for 2013 and probably every year after.
0525951113|3.0|Three stars because it was a good concept. Fails to get more stars because the concept descended into absurdity.  The first part of the book was intriguing, and the technology is mostly believable, however, about two-thirds through the story I could no longer suspend my disbelief. Instead, the author had me set my disbelief on fire, urinate on it to put out the fire, gather up the ashes and hurl them off the edge of the Grand Canyon. That's how far reality was removed from the story by the time I had reached the ending. Quick examples: Early in the story the Daemon requires Yes or No answers in order to work its way through a logic tree to know which action item to execute. Later in the story the Daemon is carrying on conversation. Early in the story the Daemon manipulates people into future outcomes based on its knowledge of individual personalities or biological cues. Later in the story the Daemon can seemingly predict the future actions of many random individuals.  The ultimate contrast in believability? Compare the assault on Sobol's mansion and its counterattack early in the story, which was frightening, violent and ingenious with the attack on the Daemon's Task Force HQ and the end of the story, which was ridiculous, violent, and over-the-top.  Another sticking point for me in the believability department was the method utilized whereby humans could communicate through the Daemon's darknet. Specially designed sunglasses would project images onto the lenses and the user would see three dimensional virtual objects hovering in their immediate space. The user would then `reach' out and touch the virtual object in some manner which would transmit a signal in the darknet to the Daemon, or another user. Need a killer robot automobile? Flip on your glasses, reach out into the virtual image in the darknet, twist a virtual knob, and a physical, robotic automobile will be screeching up to your service in less than 5 minutes.  Only two characters were really well developed--Jon Ross and Gragg. Character development was lacking elsewhere, in fact, one convention the author used when staging scenes involving meetings between the CIA, DARPA, the NSA, the FBI, and other alphabet soup government agencies was to simply refer to the entities as \\"CIA\\", NSA\\", \\"FBI\\" , etc. No names, no descriptions. Thus, you would get dialogue like this:  CIA: \\"What about the ultra wideband transmitters?\\"  NSA: \\"No go. Their oscillator loop circuits interfere with GPS signal reception.\\"  FBI: \\"If we fine tuned the antenna arrays to a frequency band that would...\\"  I guess the author thought it would be a clever way of presenting the US government as a faceless entity, but it didn't work for me.  The theme of the story that wealthy corporations using technology have altered society by widening the chasm between the have and have nots, is worth exploring. Sadly the author was more intent on providing techno babble, computer science hand waving, and whiz-bang gadgets than he was in expanding on the theme.

I know it is a free app, but that was ridiculous.  even if the ad was for a movie or product I enjoy, I still wouldn't want it appearing during the game like that.  can't recommend this app.
0439023521|5.0|The title of my review really says it all. As an avid reader I spend quite some time reading over customer reviews to make sure i'm getting a book i know i'll really enjoy. This series is possibly the best I've ever read. I've read the series twice already (and to be quite honest I'm tempted to read it again). It's one of those amazing books that seems to get better each time you read it. The Hunger Games is definitely a must read! The book is filled with exciting action, suspense, and a little romance. The writing really draws the reader into the world that Suzanne Collins has created.

B005OCFGTO|4.0|The Harry Potter Collection gives us all 8 films that were produced from 2001 to 2011,giving celluloid life to JK Rowlings impressive written sagas.Impressive sometimes doesn`t even begin to describe the high quality of craftsmanship that went into each and every film.From the direction,to the editing to the plot and so on and so on,everything about these films is top notch all the way.The S/FX just got better and better as the series(and technology)progressed.We saw all the main actors grow up before our very eyes without losing touch of their core characters.To round it out,as if it needs saying,is Rowlings extremely imaginative settings and characters.Her entire take on this world of wizardry and her ability to put her ideas to paper,and it to go onto film,and ALL capture and create literally millions of fans from every part of the globe,is astounding or,as Harry himself would say,brilliant.<br />I won`t go into each film,as the plots are quite well known by now,but I will say I found not one clunker in the group.They are all long films,coming in around 120 minutes or much more,but I never found myself looking at my watch or getting bored:a definite sign someone knew what they were doing.<br />Technically speaking the films are in their original w/s a/r of 1:77:1 and are clear and crisp.All DVD`s come in layered round plastic holders.All seem to sit and fit quite snugly.<br />I had to take one star off this impressive series of films for one reason.Warners decided to re-package the original single disc releases.That is if you have already bought them singly or in the 1-5 or 1-6 sets,you will already have what this one puts out,right down to the disc cover artwork,or lack thereof,and the picture/film hesitations that occur most noticeably in the first five that happen in or around the 75 minute mark of each film.Disappointing.They could have at least made a re-run of the series with new disc artwork and gotten rid of those pesky hesitations.But no,Warners,as is like most companies,had dollar signs in their eyes and rushed this set out to cash in on the Potter craze and keep it alive until their next release,which will be.....who knows when or in what fashion.There are very few extras in any of these discs save for the odd commentary or deleted scenes.But it is these extra scenes which makes me think somewhere down the line Warners will re-issue these films not only with several extra discs for each movies,but also in extended versions,similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy,which would only enhance them.And the extended versions of the LOTR films are magnificent.<br />Me,I am not that rabid a Potter fan that I want to wait for newer versions down the line,so I decided to get my Potter fix now and straight up,with little or no extras.If you are a big Potter fan,and you are among the countless legions of them,you might want to wait for those inevitable newer and remastered versions down the pike...or get these now and get those later!It is your choice but whatever you decide,you know you will be getting eight wondrous and beautiful films that bring Rowlings wondrous works to beautiful filmic life.Highly recommended.anies,had dollar signs in their eyes and rushed this set out to cash in on the Potter craze and keep it alive until their next release,which will be.....who knows when or in what fashion.There are very few extras in any of these discs save for the odd commentary or deleted scenes.But it is these extra scenes which makes me think somewhere down the line Warners will re-issue these films not only with several extra discs for each movies,but also in extended versions,similar to the Lord of the Rings trilogy,which would only enhance them.And the extended versions of the LOTR films are magnificent.

0439023513|1.0|The first book, The Hunger Games, I found interesting.  Very imaginative plot, however, the dialogue in this book, and all three, I found very dull.  The second two books were a disappointment. Since they were so well reviewed, that is why I decided to read them.  I didn't find myself particularly interested in any of the characters, and the action didn't seem to be moving anywhere.  There is a lot of death, alot of destruction, alot of angst, and a lot of rebellion.  To what end?  I kept reading, hoping it would improve or actually get somewhere.  In my opinion, it never did.  I didn't even finish the third book.<br /><br />I'm sorry but I do not see the attraction of this series, and can't fathom why the trilogy is the top seller on Amazon's fiction list.  These books reminded me of the Twilight series; an interesting idea never really fleshed out with competent writing or believeable characters.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover fits the Kindle very neatly. It preserves the Kindle's form factor. In fact, it makes holding the Kindle even more comfortable. It seems like the front has magnetic strips that can put the device to sleep when it is closed but the Kindle probably does not support that feature yet. Overall, a very good buy.
0061122416|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It's a classic. I had it before, but I had to share it with someone else-it is that type of book!  At best, you learn a lot about life; At worst, it tells a good story. And oh, it is a very quick read

The binding seems sturdy and the print is clear.  They really should update the listing to show its a second edition though.

0060873027|2.0|I am a very big Michael Crichton fan, and I can't help but feel sympathy for Richard Preston, having to attempt to fill those large shoes and finish this book. I applaud his effort, and his intentions. (But not, perhaps the publisher's.) That being said, his feet are too small, and he would do better to wear his own shoes from now on. The only enjoyment that I got out of this book, was in trying to compare it to an actual Crichton novel, and figure out just how he went so wrong. Even trying to guess what portion of it is Crichton and what portion is Preston. That actually proved an interesting exercise, much more enjoyable than the book itself.

0439023521|2.0|I've read the entire series, but I'm leaving my review here for those interested in picking it up. I'm not sure even where to start with this one. Oh yeah:  WARNING **********  SPOILERS *************  Anyhow, I avoided this series for a while because of it's YA status, I prefer darker and more serious matter. But I thought I'd give it a try when a friend dumped the books on my doorstep. Besides, it's got the main elements of some of my favorite stories: post-apocalypse, dystopian dictatorship, rebellion, the unlikely hero, tragedy, and survival. But what it lacked was character development, a believable plot, a likeable protagonist, or a satisfying conclusion.  First book: Hunger Games  First off, she didn't make the hero, Katniss, very likeable. I give this one a pass on the first book, because we're given to understand she's had a hard life and has trust and daddy issues. The lead up to the Games, everything in the book to this point was awesome. I was into it, and couldn't wait to get to the actual Games. But it started going downhill from there. The action in the Games was very abbreviated, to the point that we did not even know who some of the competitors were, or how they died. The book is from Katniss' point of view, so I assume since she's not privy to how the others' died, we won't be either. However, the book spends a great deal of time describing how every detail of the Games is recorded and broadcast, so I assume at some point we will be watching some broadcast with Katniss and find out what happened to the others, but not so. After the main emotional death in the arena (Rue), Katniss decides to seek out Peeta and team up with him. And everything pretty much derails from there. Katniss is saved from death several times by various deux ex machina plot devices, and the rest of the book mainly follows their tepid are-they-or-aren't-they romance.   By the end of the book I am annoyed mainly by two things:   1. That Katniss does not seemed emotionally moved by either Gale or Peeta. You would think that a nice character arc would have her at least leaning one way or the   other by the end of the book, but she stays in a perfectly boring limbo while at the same time leading two guys (who have risked their lives for her) on.  2. That Katniss doesn't seem particularly skilled, likeable, strong, or interesting. In books like this, I would expect that the \\"trial by fire\\" portion of the story would refine the main character's view of themselves, and create a sort of improved person, having been refined by the fire, so to speak. But not Katniss. She makes mistake after mistake, every time being saved from death by either a plot device or a person. Other than being able to track food, she doesn't seem to be good at making plans, following orders, or thinking ahead. She's not strong or particularly clever, she can't handle gore (??), and shuts down emotionally at the slightest provocation. It seems like during most of the Games she's laying around while other people kill each other off. Even in the end, she doesn't win by defeating every last victor - she wins by default because everyone else is dead (except Peeta, which you know how that ends). She's basically a very good woodsman (woodswoman?) with a significant amount of luck and inexplicable friendships.   Second book: Catching Fire  I hardly remember what it's about, it was that uninteresting. The author continues to doggedly bore us with the teetering menage-a-trois. And in a completely not-at-all-expected plot twist, the President orders a second Games for Katniss and Peeta to compete in. Add a few more characters, change the scenery, and it's another battle. Yawn. More of the same surly, abrasive, impulsive, reckless Katniss, that now for some reason has got the entire country holding her up as a rallying point for the rebellion. The book ends with them breaking her out of the arena and flying her toward the unknown District 13, where we expect to see the Final Battle inthe third book.  Third book: Mockingjay  This book actually made me angry. Katniss is, if possible, even more dislikeable. She has so far managed to: endanger her family, get herself injured on the point of death several times, get other tributes killed on her behalf, had the entire District 12 wiped out, play head games with the boys, and be as uncooperative as possible. They are taken to the District 13 where she refuses to help and stays high most of the time. Then she decides to go fight, but as usual, messes everything up and does not follow order, acts recklessly, and gets a lot of people killed or injured. For whatever reason, they decide to send her to ANOTHER battle, where once again, she screws everything up and does not follow orders, and gets injured to the point of death AGAIN. Then they find out that Peeta is brainwashed somehow, and he does not love her anymore. Gale is fed up with her games, and hangs around to...make her feel bad? In any case, Katniss spends most of this book being shot or blown up, high or hiding in closets. Peeta spends most of this book absent, being tortured back at the capital, or heavily brainwashed, in which case there are no friendly words between him and Katniss. And once again, for the biggest battle of all, Katniss manages again to convince the people she has ignored and disrespected from Day 1 to let her go out there. And once again, she ends up somehow messing everything up and taking her team of camera men and one deranged Peeta on a direct assault on the President's mansion. Like I said, she's not much for planning.   Surprise, surprise, she manages to get almost everyone killed, including her sister Prim, who made enough of an appearance in the book to inexplicably materialize ahead of the invading force and be blown up (and the scene is handled so vaguely, I wasn't even sure it was Prim for a few pages), and Finnick, who grew as a character (shocker!) enough to become a major character, only to die in a throwaway line when they counted heads later. And what happens next? Katniss gets injured to the point of death. And spends the rest of the book moping around and being high. And killing someone else, but not the President, and oh lord this review is boring me worse than the book.   This book reminds me of the MST3K movie, \\"Agent for H.A.R.M.\\" during which at one point, one of the guys says, \\"It's more like 'Old Guy Who Sort-of Helped Agent For H.A.R.M.'\\" There seems to be virtually no redeeming quality about the main character. Her surviving the plot has nothing to do with her talents, abilities, or personality, and everything to do with the Plot Gods resolving to keep her alive, but only barely. It's pathetic, really. And so are the people around her who seem to enjoy suffering death for a glimpse of her back as she ignores them or stomps out of the room. I gave this series 2 stars, because I love a good post-apocalypse, survival, Thunderdome, phoenix story, and this series served to, if nothing else, give me a framework to use when I'm re-imagining how it should have gone in my head.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't read too many Stephen King books, but the subject matter of this one grabbed my attention.  11/22/63...I clearly remember that Friday afternoon. I was a third grader, living in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.  We were putting our chairs up on our desks, anticipating a wonderful weekend away from school, when a radio broadcast suddenly came on over the school's PA system. It wasn't until I saw the shocked expression on my teacher's face that I truly heard what was being said.  President Kennedy had been shot and killed.  That wonderful weekend was anything but.  This book immediately drew me in and transported me back in time with Jake Epping.  I vividly recalled what life was like between 1958 and 1963.  King captured it beautifully.  This story is about much more than Oswald & Kennedy.  It is about all of the what-ifs & whys of everyday life.  I highly recommend this book.

1609410416|3.0|As an audiobook I believe this book has some value. Ellen is Ellen and listening to her read this book put a smile on my face more than once. But, if I had paid for this book I would have felt really let down. There are entire \\"chapters\\" that are only a sentence or two long. There is a coloring section for kids which just doesn't translate to audio.  There really is nothing to this book. The audio version is just over three hours long if that says anything. In comparison, Tina Fey's Bossypants is five and half hours. Just because it's a short book doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. But, if you're on a budget you might want to just borrow this one.

B004HO6I4W|1.0|My son loves this movie. It is entertaining and has really enjoyable music throughout. My frustration, however, is with the playback functionality. You can fast-forward through the previews, but then you are FORCED to sit through the promotional reel about the \\"extras\\" on the disc. Anyone with a toddler knows that when you're turning a movie on, you want to be able to get right to the menu so you can start the movie, or even select a particular scene.  It's annoying and unrealistic to expect viewers to watch this footage every. single. time. As a matter of principle, I will no longer purchase Blu Rays or DVDs from 20th Century Fox.

B000002H6C|5.0|Things were changing for the world of Metallica, Cliff Burton had died in a horrible bus accident, and Metallica was starting to drift away from it's Thrash sound a bit. Yes this is still a Thrash Album, but it's different. I note that this album does have the single fastest Metallica song made, but it's a different tempo, not slowed down like the Black Album, or really sped up like Master of Puppets.   It's also an odd one in retrospect to near absence of Bass sound. Indeed, while different stories do exist, and the most popular one being that Metallica was playing a prank on the new Bass Guitar player Jason Newsted, by turning down his bass. Personally, I don't think Metallica would deliberately sabotage its own sound. I think the producer forgot to add the Bass in the final mix and that was one reason why Metallica moved on to a new producer.   Overall, this a great album, and works to certain moods, it's my choice album for having a bad day, but there is no other Metallica Album like it. The first three are their own era, Metallica album and the load series is kinda their own sound, which even St. Anger Belongs to in a very warped sense. Then Death Magnetic is a throwback to cleaned up Kill Em All. \\"And Justice For All\\" is more its own sound than any other album. Finally I can say, Metallica detractors will start lining up here, but don't listen to them, listen to the albums here, and the ones that follows and decide for yourself.   Further note, on my computer, Death Magnetic follows this album in order, and I found with great pleasure just how well these two albums go when played together.   *Blackened* Described by one amazon review as an improved version of Fight Fire with Fire, wait what? This isn't fight fire with fire redone as the top review says. This is its own song. This song is semi Thrash, and semi not. It changes between two tempos, the Thrash sound, and then the slower train like sound. It plays a very constant pair of riffs that the lyrics followin quick spout out manners. This song is an excellent example of just how good Lars can be with the drums. Overall, it's a great song, it's hammer trainlike sound with the Thrash overlay make it a great listen.   *And Justice for all* This is probably one of the most complicated songs in the entire Metallica music library, and it's a beast of a song, and my list favorite on the album. It's got a great beginning and carries itself well through the song, but by the end of it, after you've heard it a few times, you tend, at least in my case, to go ahead and switch the next song. It has its Thrashy moments, but this is much like the whole album, major drum beat going, like a hammer. This song is what I believe to have been the decisive factor in causing Metallica to trim the lengths of some of their songs in future albums.   *Eye of the Beholder*  One of the rarely performed live songs, like the one mentioned above. This song is more evidence of the changing face of Metallica. This is not a fast song, it's speed is closer to the Black Album than it is to Master of Puppets. Overall, the song is enjoyable and like most of the album, this is a good song for bad moods. One thing I've always noticed is just how well it links into the next song, \\"One.\\" I think it's slower pace combined with length, like \\"Justice\\" before it, helped push Metallica to shorter songs.  *One*  Back in 1999 I had my friend make a mix of Metallica songs, and I'd listed all the songs that I thought of as my favorite, but I had room for one more. On a google search I found some random top ten list and found \\"One\\" at number 1. I said screw it, and I added to the list. I've since become convinced that it's Metallica's best song, or at least close to it. In recent years I've found \\"Fade to black\\" to be my favorite, but One is up there.   And speaking of \\"Fade\\" this song follows the \\"Fade to Black\\" song design and creating a slow opening, that builds upon itself for the majority of the song, and then descends into Metal Heaven at the end with a hard kick you in the balls attack of metal glory. This song probably does it better than \\"Fade\\" or Sanitarium\\" but this is only my opinion. IT is still, without a doubt, one of the best Metallica songs, and at least in my mind, is unusual in being one of the few songs where I prefer \\"Studio\\" over \\"live.\\"  *The Shortest Straw*  This is one of those songs I'd like to see performed live. It basically is about McCarthyism in the 50s which probably makes it one of the last cold war era song to directly reference something of the cold war, during the actual Cold War. It's a good song, one I enjoy, like most of Metallica's song, for the first 5 Metallica albums, there is no such thing as a throwaway song, but it's one of the ones I don't think about listening to often. Still, I like to play Gears of War with it in the background. Finally, there is an unconfirmed rumor that this song could be because Cliff drew the shortest straw on the bus ride.   *Harvester of Sorrow*  This is something of a Jason Newsted song, it's not wrote by him, but through going through youtubes and listening to it myself, this song makes me think of Jason because as James said, just follow Jason and he's going to show you what the F**K to do. In a way, it reminds me of Sad But True, however, I enjoy it much more than Sad But True. It's very straight forward with a decent solo. Another enjoyable offering.   *The Frayed Ends of Sanity*  This is probably one of my favorites of the album. Before I get into how awesome this is, I feel that this song is the best example of the lacking bass. This song is already so freaking awesome, but if you listen to the live version of the Metallica Box Set, you hear where the bass supposed to be, so it really makes it unfortunate that it's not here. However, as I said, I greatly enjoy this song. It kinda stands along in design, there are moments that remind me of MoP, and moments that remind me of slower version of \\"DisposableHeroes\\" but overall, this is one of my choice songs on the album.   *To Live is To Die*  The most beautiful Metallica song ever made. A tribute to cliff, and in some ways a tribute to creative side of Thrash. It's technically not considered an instrumental, because Hetfield has a single lyric near the end, but other than that, it's instrumental. There is just such beauty about this, and yet it's pure metal. If you're like me, the bridge at about half way will move you. RIP Cliff.   *Dyers Eve*  According to most people, and I agree with them, this is the fastest Metallica song ever made. Supposedly it's even faster than \\"Whiplash,\\" but you can debate on that if you wish. It's song about James' childhood and the troubles therein. Much like most of the album, it's rarely played live, and this is unfortunate.   Finally, in closing, I have mixed feelings about the departure of Rasmussen as producer. On one hand, he produces Ride the Lightning, and Master of Puppets, and those are the Metallica Standards, but on the other, it's his production here that is key. Is the production of this album shoddy as the Amazon review suggests? Nowhere near! Is it as good as it could be? No... So, while Bob Rock helped Make Metallica the best selling band of all time, it's Rasmussen who played the role in giving Metallica it's signature sound that carried it forward, but perhaps, it was just time for Rasmussen to go. There is just so much any one person can do creatively.   IT's a dark album, and it's a great album. Must have.

B0051T46XM|5.0|It was a gamble to rent Troll Hunter but I feel like I recieved a winning payout after viewing.  The film is a cross between Blair Witch Project and Jurrasic Park.  Despite the subject being seriously portrayed, it did have a bit of cheesiness which gave the film comical side. If you know a bit of ancient Norse lore it adds more to the viewing experience and enjoyment. This film could become a cult classic.  BTW the scenery of northern Norway is stunning.

B004AKCME8|4.0|LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE flaunts an ungainly title and a cumbersome unfolding of  narrative. But, geez, it's so pretty to look at. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and it's a shame that the filmmakers couldn't invest as much in its ho-hum storytelling. It strives for an epic feel, but I think falls just short of grandeur. It features the coming-of-age tale of the owlet Soren. Soren has long been entranced by his father's tales of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole, them legendary owl warriors who once waged a great war against the despicable Pure Ones.<br /><br />So far Soren has led a dull, sheltered life. He can't even fly all that well as yet. But one bout of oneupmanship too many with his more skilled brother, Kludd, results in their plummeting from their treetop home and onto the woodsy bottom. And owls have no place being on the ground, where they're rendered exceedingly vulnerable. Soren and Kludd are owlnapped and taken to the stronghold of the Pure Ones, them renegade owls still bent on enslaving the rest of their brethern. Their preferred method is to expose their victims to the moon's influence, \\"moon-blinking\\" they calls it, the moon in essence stupefying the unwary and transforming them into zombie work drones.<br /><br />But I'm going on and on about a pretty generic plot. Suffice it to say, brother Kludd opts to stay with the Pure Ones, is enlisted in their savage troops. Soren escapes and embarks on a quest to locate the Owls of Ga'Hoole, to warn them about the Pure Ones. Along the way, Soren meets several companions, establishes a fellowship (this is mandatory in heroic quests). Thank goodness for the burly Twilight and Soren's snake nursemaid, Mrs. P. They provide most of what humor there is. This epic is so determinedly earnest and somber that even J.R.R. Tolkien thinks it needs to lighten up. Tack on characters with no grace notes and unfolding events that failed to draw me in and, really, the breathtaking animation is the sole reason to recommend this film. This is a visual spectacle in which to bask your eyeballs. Else, take the plot and the characters and the tired dialogue, and insert a live action format, and I think what you have is something the Sci-Fi Channel would be proud to call its own.<br /><br />Parents, be warned that while there is no blood or gore, the film doesn't shy from rolling out scenes of fierce owl-on-owl violence. In this narrative, death is very much part of the order of things. Only, it's a higher evolved circle of life, what with various birds clad in armor and tearing adversaries with vicious metal talons. There are some very dynamic action sequences, not the least of which is Soren's harrowing showdown with Metal Beak, the malevolent chieftain of the Pure Ones. I wished I cared more about who won this death match. I guess I'm edging towards Soren, even though he makes Frodo Baggins seem breezy. But I harbor mad respect for Metal Beak whose creepy metal accoutrements make him look downright scary. You gaze at Metal Beak and you don't doubt he's capable of serious, er, foul play. Except that in a children's story, villains aren't allowed to win, so suck on that, Metal Beak. 3 or 3.5 stars out of 5 for this one, with its animated virtuosity and disappointing storytelling.ason to recommend this film.

0307593495|3.0|I read the book a year or so ago in Swedish. It has a complex plot revolving around Cold War politics. Mankell is frustrated with what he sees as Sweden's \\"hypocritical\\" neutrality during the Cold War years. That is, he feels that Sweden was too much on the side of the West. This leads him to some rather odd theories about the submarine crises of the 1980s. (Mysterious submarines were patrolling Swedish waters, but mainly they could never be found and Sweden was quite ambivalent about confronting them. The only one that was ever found was a Soviet sub that ran aground inside Swedish territory. Some believe there never were any subs, that it was a kind of UFO hysteria, while some believe the subs were Soviet, and others prefer to believe they were NATO spies.)  Because I couldn't get into the conspiracy theory aspect of the mystery, it was less than satisfying. And several sad things happen to Kurt Wallander on the personal front in this novel. Mankell says it will be his last Wallander novel. In an NPR interview he laughed and said at least he didn't make the same mistake as Conan Doyle in failing to permanently get rid of his character (Sherlock Holmes). Indeed, in some ways this novel is more final than even the tragedy at the Reichenbach Falls.

B006NXIO7O|3.0|This film produced by Luc Besson is a throwback to LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON THE PROFESSIONAL with influences from De Palma's MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE and SCARFACE. Visually this film is close to the slick flash visuals of Tony Scott films such as MAN ON FIRE. The relationship between Zoe Saldana and her painter boyfriend is similiar to Nikita's boyfriend in LA FEMME NIKITA. The early scenes with a young Zoe seeing her parents murdered is straight out of LEON. My favourite set-piece was the early prison assassination sequence as Zoe manouevre's herself through the air-conditioning shaft which was reminiscent of Tom Cruise manouevering through the shaft in the CIA building in MISSION:IMPOSSIBLE. The way Zoe assassinates the target in prison and works her way back to her prison cell without anyone realising is reminiscent of good/quality spy and assassin films. The climax of the film where Zoe infiltrated the cartels mansion for a full-blown shoot-out and killing of the head of the cartel is classic SCARFACE. It's not as great as LA FEMME NIKITA and LEON but has inspired set-pieces and Zoe Saldana handles the fights and over-the-top weaponry with great convincing skill. One can believe Zoe to be a ruthless and nameless assassin out for revenge.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|YouVersion Bible is very well designed and has an elegant, easy to use interface. I love the huge number of translations, I was even able to quickly locate and share a Korean version with an exchange student. :)   What's really great is that some very good translations can be downloaded for free for offline use. To top it off, some well known versions include audio books that you can listen to if you are online. That feature is fantastic on my Droid Bionic (when 3G/4G or WiFi is available).  It's easy to create an account to save highlights and notes in the Cloud, and then use them on ANY device running the app. The only downside is that when you are offline, you cannot view, add, edit, or delete your highlights and notes.   Being cut off from your notes and highlights while offline is a MAJOR shortcoming (vs. OliveTree) but I still have it installed on my Bionic and all my family's tablets (2 Fires and an iPad). Offline caching and online synching would make this app the ultimate mobile Bible. Despite that omission, the YouVersion Bible is still a FANTASTIC app!

I'm learning German in college, so I thought I would try reading a German edition of something, even if I only get through one page in a sitting. Harry Potter und der Stein der Weisen seemed like the perfect choice for me because I absolutely love Harry Potter and I know the content so well. Even when I don't know all the German words being used, I am still able to follow along with what is going on by using the words I do know to figure out where in the story I am. I'm hoping that as I continue to read it, I will get more vocab practice and therefore get better at speaking the language myself.

B006VA3ZEG|5.0|Having greatly enjoyed Season 1 of Downton Abbey, I was looking forward to Season 2, and I found it as captivating and engaging as Season 1. In Season 2, the time frame is from the Battle of the Somme in 1916 to the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1919. For those unfamiliar with the series, I would advise watching Season 1 first as it provides a lot of background information on many of the characters, as well as continuity.<br /><br />Change is a major theme this season - the Great War has wrought many changes to the residents of Downton Abbey. The Granthams, i.e. the Earl of Grantham (played by Hugh Bonneville); his wife, the American heiress, Cora, Countess Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern); their three adult daughters, beautiful Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), bitter Lady Edith (Laura Carmichael), and idealistic Lady Sybil (Jessica Brown-Findlay); and of course, The Dowager Countess Grantham, the Earl's mother played by the incomparable Dame Maggie Smith.<br />The usually robust and confident Earl (I love Hugh Bonneville's portrayal of the benevolent Earl) feels somewhat out of place this season as he yearns to be of use to his country, yet all he gets is an honorary rank in the military, and is not considered for active duty due to his age. Mary is melancholic over her failed romance, Edith wants to master driving so that she can take over in case the family's chauffeur is called up to fight, and lovely Lady Sybil goes off to nursing school.<br /><br />The staff of Downton undergo changes of their own, and experience both ups and downs. Brendan Coyle who plays the Earl's faithful valet, John Bates, experiences some serious challenges when his estranged wife, Vera (Maria Kennedy) turns up. Tom Barrow (Rob James Collier), the footman, is away at war, but finds the experience unnerving to the point that he resorts to drastic measures to make his way home.<br /><br />There is good balance between scenes at the warfront and scenes at home. The battle scenes are credibly done, evoking all the fear and horror of the war. But I admit I was more interested in the machinations back home at Downton, and watching familiar and new characters resort to manipulation, scheming, and intrigues. There is a short, 10-minute segment prior to episode 1 which shows the setting for Downton Abbey, i.e. Highclere Castle in Hampshire, and includes interviews with the present owner as well as the director, producer, and cast members of the show. The streaming via Amazon Instant Video is of high quality, with clear, crisp images and no interruptions.war.

0439023521|4.0|I assume you've read enough about the concept and plot overview, so forgive me for not rehashing them here.  I loved this book for the first 2/3rds.  About 75% of the way into the book, my suspension of disbelief was bent too far.  I was outraged at the convenient rule change. One too many times the protagonist was saved by a contrived device.  I hated the notion of plot solvers dropping from the sky.  Wouldn't the multitude of antagonists also be receiving those?  It was too much to keep on believing; but since I was already 3/4 done with the first strictly-for-pleasure book I'd read in 20+ years, I figure I might as well see it out.  At this point, the book was \\"3 stars\\".  In the final moments in the arena, I changed my mind and restored the book's 4 star review.

However, somewhere in the middle I nearly didn't finish it because what was happening was so disgusting I wasn't sure I wanted to keep reading.  But Lewis made me laugh so often (frequently by simply quoting those wonderful oddballs who bet against the conventional \\"wisdom\\" of Wall Street) that I was able to read through to the end.

B0063GORYU|4.0|App is quick and easy to use, but game play is so sensitive that it's easy to select the wrong cards.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|awesome game.  since it has so many games in it it never gets old.  what's better then getting point just for trying and coming back?  this is deffinatley a must get :)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|random entertainment. some of the games are fun some are annoying and some just plain suck . but it kills time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of different games most of which I like some are hard to get controls to work for the most part really good app for free
B0053B347M|2.0|I bought this for my work monitor, I have a 24\\" ASUS widescreen monitor. I was thinking that the USB cord was gonna be too short but that turned out ok.. though it couldn't hurt to have it a little longer... it was easy to pull the tape back and place it on the back of the monitor.. no problem there... what is the bummer is...<br />Its simply not bright enough... I could use like 5 of these things to even close to the backlighting i was wanting... I mean sure it makes for a ok nightlight behind the screen but thats about it... if you have any light at all on in the room your simply not gonna know you have it.. none of my co-workers even noticed I had it back there. and to top it off.. the side of the strip where the wire comes off of.. the part you plug it... falls down quite alot.. and I promise you its not being pulled on or anything.. its just the weight of the cord pulling it down.. sure i could use some better tape but just telling ya what you get... I can't complain too much for the price but.. again.. I need like 5 of these things to notice anythings back there...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think I will be forever changed after reading this book. There are a few authors that make me feel like I am in the world that they have created, but Suzanne Collins has done that in spades! My heart still beats a little faster when I just think about this future North America.   In the future, there is no USA. Only a country, divided into districts and an over-ruling Capital. Each district has a \\"specialty\\" that provides for a pampered life in the Capital. However, there is only poverty in the districts. In a world without a middle class, many starve and die of very common causes. Collins has put forth a very believable possible future for our country. War, famine and having our children fighting for their lives and to entertain the pampered society of the Capital.  This is not only a great read, but a very good commentary on the outrageous focus that today's society places on the superficial and almost none on the content of a person. This book reminds us that the people, not the ruling body of the government, have the ultimate power. That the government can only exist by the people, for the people and as long as the people allow it to.  Parents, this book is intense and not for small children. However, it does bring up good opportunities to discuss topics ranging from politics, human rights, survival techniques and charity. I suggest that parents read this book (and the others in the trilogy) prior to letting your children do so.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love it I currently have 20 golden eggs finished all the worlds w/o three stars on every level it great!
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins brings you into the land of the \\"Hunger Games\\" with so much power that you never want to leave.  I couldn't put the book down, then when I was finished, I wanted more.  This is such an exciting book with anger, compassion, love, and brutal murder all rolled into one.  I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy, \\"Catching Fire\\" and \\"Mocking Jay\\".
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game but wish it would explain how to play some of them but yet cool trying to figure it out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great app. works well with the kindle fire. provides reminders for when I forget to read my Bible or do my devotional.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are simple yet amusing, the idea of playing games to unlock new games is rewarding and fun. I recommend this.
B0061S073A|4.0|After purchasing an iPad 2 as a \\"family\\" tablet I was sorely disappointed to find that it is designed to be a purely personal device with virtually no functionality to (a) create \\"accounts\\" for individual family members as you can on a family computer; (b) no way to provide a central \\"play space\\" for a child with access enabled to a set of devices; and (c) no way to place the same app on different access screens so that even if you set aside a \\"page\\" for a child, the apps that appear there can appear nowhere else.<br /><br />Given the widespread criticism of the KF at its introduction for a lack of \\"parental controls\\" I was shocked to find that the KF is actually superior to the iPad on all these points. All it takes is the addition of Kids Place to your KF.<br /><br />No, it's not perfect. I would like to provide my seven year old with access to her books and music within the app. As it is, I have to enable her access to all books and music on the KF to allow her to read her own books and listen to her music. And for those who want to limit but not prevent internet access, Kids Place won't help. But at least I'm able to let her play her games and access educational apps without worrying about finding the KF reset to factory defaults or an unexpected refrigerator showing up at our door because \\"1 click\\" ordering enabled her to buy one.<br /><br />All in all, it's a great app for those who want to share their KF with a young member of the family. Not nearly as useful for older kids but that's why it gets four stars rather than five.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|The controls are frustrating on the Kindle Fire. They are not always responsive, which makes the gameplay disappointing. And if losing because the buttons on the bottom aren't working properly isn't enough, everytime you want to start a new game, you HAVE to click on the ad in order to begin a new game.<br /><br />I gave two stars because I also have this game on my Samsung Galaxy Vibrant, and it works much better, without any of the control or ad issues.  This game just isn't suited for a tablet.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The app is simple. it golives you simple games. don't expect something crazy difficult. def a between classes or commute game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun simple skill games. Screen controls are just a little slow on some of the games. But a great way to kill time.

1451648537|4.0|Every single detail about Steve is awesome. Sometimes disappointed, sometimes marvelous! Now you can get to know him and have to recognize why he was, did, and made. Steve was a conductor of the Apple Orchestra. I miss Steve's presentation when a new baby comes out. It is like a drama. Stay Foolish, Stay Hungry!

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app could be the app that persuades me to buy a tablet.  That way, I can do office stuff remotely on my pc and still have the portability of a tablet.   It works well.  Even movies stream well to my evo, with the audio playing through the speakers.  As long as you remember to leave your pc turned on that is!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are fun and some are just stupid...I really don't like it...I.just kelp it for my little sister...otherwise it would be off my kindle.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|awesome, useful every day app for notes and such. I use it daily to track stuff. try it out yourself
1451627289|5.0|Even as a baby boomer who was 14 years old when Kennedy died, I still come down solidly on the side of those who loved this book. I am so grateful that King did not give us a long alternate history! When I saw how long the book was, I feared it would be a combination of an intricate, drawn-out plot of a few days or a few weeks, ending with a thrilling race to the Book Depository -- yawn.  I don't need to know what happened, or what would have happened. I was there, and I have my own imagination.<br /><br />I had not gotten too far into it before I discovered that this was not just one story, but, like Stephen King's best work, a cornucopia of novellas, short stories, fragments, plot meanderings, characters we get to love and hate unreasonably intensely, and an observation of the tragedies and victories of life and love. All with that wonderful patina of other-worldliness.  This might be the first time travel novel in which the past did not feel less real than the protagonist's present.<br /><br />I loved this book. Wow. Thank you, Mr. King. Again. I never feel the way I do after a Stephen King novel, not reading any other novelist, living or dead. His fictions are like I imagine crack cocaine to me, without having had the experience. What is it John Belushi said? \\"Like kissing the face of God.\\" That was one of his drugs, maybe the cocaine-heroin cocktail that killed him. That's what reading a good Stephen King book is like for me. Aside from my dreams and the more transcendent ends of my mystical experience in prayer, I know no more compelling alternative reality. Yes, I will gush. I am 62 years old now, and not ashamed to wear my feelings on my sleeve. And I have read literally thousands of novels in my lifetime, from the classics to sheer pulp. Wow. Thank you, Mr. King.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|Love this toddler game huh? Thumbs down for BS reviews. This its totally unacceptable. Get with it devs, it doesn't help
B005K17RU0|4.0|app is easy to use and easy to look up multiple locations I recommend this for download if u need a weather app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app for games has small, quick, fun games. the more games you win, the more games you unlock. Simple.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|This is a good app, but I wish the feedback for correct vs incorrect answers was someone speaking instead of a musical sound.  Kids have to learn when a tone indicates an incorrect response.  Someone speaking in resopnse to a choice would make things clearer.  At 99 cents it's priced about right.  This is Amazon's free app of the day today and anyone giving it 1 star because they dislike kids games should have their review removed.  It's unfair to the app maker, selfish, and unkind to kids and their educational needs.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is entertaining but could have been better. they need to work on how well the controls worked. they are a little choppy.
6304698798|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband and he loved it. This movie and others from Clint Eastwood are one of his favorites.
0307949508|5.0|1:32AM.............I just finished \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\"......OMG what a book!!<br />I recently saw the movie \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and then had to read the book.<br />It was so great I ordered book two \\"The Girl/Fire\\".<br />I was about half way through the book this evening, but I just couldn't put it down.<br />What a ride!!!  I can hardly wait for the movie to come out.<br />As soon as the bookstore opens tomorrow I have to get \\"The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest\\".<br />I can't wait for the mail to deliver it.<br />I advise everyone to see the movie, \\"Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\", first and then read the book, it fills in all the details.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|Not sure what to say except great movie, great plot, beautiful picture & superb sound quality. Disney does a great job with their Blu-ray transfers. A joy to watch & hear.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's a fun way to pass the time. I like that you have to work to open the other games. Gives you something to work towards.
0525478817|5.0|I knew when I preordered this book more than six months ago that it would be great. All of Green's books are. I was not prepared, physically, emotionally, or psychologically for just how good this book was going to be. Good isn't a word that describes it, it's not powerful enough- stupendous nearly covers it. I had heard John read the first chapter last summer, but I shied away from the more recent readings or previews because I wanted to be a clean slate for reading the first time. My husband and I ordered one copy for the two of us, and only now realise how big of a mistake that was. I gave my husband first dibs on reading it, as I had gotten to read Maureen Johnson't The Name of the Star first. He's a school-teacher and began reading it after he got off work. He had finished by the time we went to bed. It's a really fast read, nearly impossible to put down. Your heart breaks when Esther's does, the way Green describes Amsterdam is so fantastic, you feel as though you are there and can see and smell what the characters are seeing and smelling. The book takes you through an entire spectrum of human emotions, and I'll admit I cried like a little girl. Several times. This is a book about a person going through cancer, not a cliche cancer book. There is nothing cliche about this book. The way Green describes the existential crises the characters go through make you re-evaluate your entire way of life. I've never read a book that has changed me (for the better) like The Fault in Our Stars has. I want to buy extra copies so I can give one to my future children, grandchildren, nieces, and nephews. To be perfectly honest, I don't know if there is any way to improve the written word. I don't know what Green will do next. I don't know if there is any way to write a better book. I will continue to read other works of fiction, but I doubt seriously that I will ever find a book better than this.
B004NO55EK|5.0|This series takes you so many unexpected places. I LOVE it.  Fantastic - fantastic - fantastic.  Anyone who doesn't love it, I just can't relate to.  Seriously - whoever is giving it  less than 3 stars must be seriously not be in touch with their emotions - or never really been in love.
B004M9ZI0M|4.0|I'm a bit of a Shakespeare nut, owning the large majority of his plays on DVD, and often more than one version of the more popular plays. So I was eager for a new version of \\"The Tempest,\\" and I wasn't able to catch this one in the theaters since it never played near where I live. Unfortunately nearly all of the reviews I had read of this version were decidedly mixed. Still, I wasn't going to let them keep me from seeing it. Well, I'm really glad I bought it because it's *much* better than the mixed reviews had led me to believe. Helen Mirren's excellent interpretation of \\"Prospero\\" as \\"Prospera\\" strikes me as quite natural -- that is, it doesn't come across as a trendy gender-switching gimmick -- and most of the other actors are superb as well. The \\"special effects,\\" particularly with Ariel, are effectively handled. My only reservation, in fact, has to with Djimon Hounsou's performance as Caliban. He himself is, I believe, very good, but his strong accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand Caliban's speeches, which include some of the loveliest, most touching in the play. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this DVD, which includes a terrific \\"making of\\" bonus extra.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it was a good game I liked it a lot I recamended it to friends the like it too I play it all night it is so good
B0041KKYBA|5.0|The documentary is useful as part of a personal introduction to our new and destroyed economy. When we have leaders like those interviewed and discussed in this film, it's not likely to get much better. Apparently it's every man for himself.<br /><br />There was one man who complained. He was, of course, fired. Was he a hero? Maybe. How long did he wait before he blew the whistle? What were his motives? Was there anything else he could have done? I have to think that decent people could have done something when they knew the economy of our nation was at stake, when they knew people were unknowing victims,  their retirement funds put into worthless investments and there was nothing they could have done about it even if they had known.<br /><br />This is a documentary with short 'blips' of different executives, policy-makers, and people who we are forced to depend on as so-called leaders. It doesn't matter where you stand politically, it's obvious that our leaders have let us down. Most of them refused to be interviewed for this documentary. That was probably wise. They could only have made themselves look even more corrupt. Regarding what was shown to have happened to our 401-Ks, where do we go to get our money back? We know where our money went, but even putting them in jail wouldn't get it back for us.<br /><br />I bought this and watched it as part of my personal plan to educate myself so I can make the best decisions for my own personal economy. These people can't be trusted. I watched as they stumbled, stammered, and struggled to answer even simple questions.<br /><br />Investing will never be the same after these clowns have destroyed our economy.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|Absolutely fabulous! Beautifully done graphics, interface and puzzles. Just enough to make the child THINK! Not guess, think. Reason out why the choice is appropriate, make a thought out decision based on observation. Builds confidence with their reasoning.

B0011W48FE|5.0|This DVD covers a number of different aspects of the siege against Masada than we usually see or read about. Artifacts including rings, necklaces, pottery, pottery sherds with names, arrowheads, and stones that may have been catapulted at the rebels during the siege are shown. Expanding from the topic of Masada though, it also gives a fairly detailed accounting of the siege against the rebels holding the city of Jerusalem. Several fascinating theories are included about what really happened with Josephus. Exactly what did he do to make his fellow Jews hate him? Was he a traitor, or did he try to negotiate a better ending in Jerusalem? Since we depend on the writing of Josephus for our understanding of what happened at Masada, did he write it accurately, or was it flavored to make him look better to his Roman masters? Archeological findings are helping solve some of these mysteries.<br /><br />I seem to learn something unique from each book, article and video/movie about Masada. This one started out with more information on the Sicari rebels than most. It also talks about Herod a little more, even giving more detail about how he actually would have used the palace he built at Masada. One source said Herod never stayed there. The others haven't said that. This one went on the assumption that he did use it, although he never had to use it as the fortress it was built to be. It's strange to imagine that after putting all that extraordinary effort into building the palaces there, that he wouldn't have used them. He was said to have been afraid that Cleopatra's new husband, Marc Antony might decide to attack and 'give' Masada to Cleopatra for a wedding present. This version says that Herod and Cleopatra had previously had some kind of relationship, so Herod would have had good reason to be a little nervous.<br /><br />There is a better computerized picture than most other sources of what the three-tiered palace would have looked like and how it would have been used, some of it a little amusing.<br /><br />Expect a surprising ending. There's a discussion of what we know vs. what is speculative, the evidence for and against the traditional ending, and finally, why what we may have always heard may not actually have been the way it happened. The introduction of new information made me want to argue back at times. You'll probably be exposed to some new ideas on this topic, whether you agree with them or not.<br /><br />I very much disagreed with the Harvard professor interviewed who said that our interest in Masada is the same kind of morbid interest that we have about the Jonesboro massacre. If one has to compare it to something it might be closer to the Alamo, but still vastly different. There is really no appropriate comparison.<br /><br />My own interest (not expertise) is in history and archeology, particularly Beersheva and, of course, Qumran. Masada is a special situation. It's a fairly controlled, concise area where archeologists have some facts about what happened. It's interesting to compare those facts with the archeological findings. The events that took place at Masada also help to fill in some of the 'rest of the story' following the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans.<br /><br />This video does include subtitles in several different languages, including English, French, Russian, and Hebrew, Spanish, and German. They are a little annoying because they are large and block the names and credentials of the speakers being interviewed. I may go back later and practice reading Hebrew using them though. They may be ideal for that.of it a little amusing.<br /><br />Expect a surprising ending.

B000ZJTPLG|4.0|I got the Classic version of the Vox Amplug.  In the description they say it sounds like a Fender.  Well, that does not happen on any setting.  It actually has more of an AC30 sound.  While I would have liked nice clean tones that emulate Fender, the semi-clean tones I get with this device is usable for practicing and messing around.  The gain type distortion is ridiculous, meaning it will sound like total crap way before you turn it all the way up.  But at a moderate setting, there is still plenty of tone to it.  I got this thing to allow me to practice and play silently, and it does that fine.  While I did not get the tone I want, I enjoy the tone it offers.  I am giving it 4 stars because it met my $40 worth of expectations.

B0054TVW04|4.0|How does this guy repeatedly pump out excellent books? Each of the three I've read--coming at roughly two year intervals--has been different and thoughtful.<br />This one presents the six \\"killer apps\\" that Western civilization used to dominate others.<br /><br />As a history lesson, this one repeated many things we know; but I was surprised by three:<br />1. The value of competition as a Darwinian force for progress was compelling.  Most of the West's innovations were honed by the brutal competition among many small polities. I would have welcomed a discussion of Brian Arthur's The Evolution of Technology, but maybe it was too recent.<br />2. The leading edge of the Western invasion is its clothing!<br />3. The West's work ethic is the Protestant Ethic, and both it and Christianity are declining rapidly in Europe while the reverse is happening in China after centuries of missionary work failed.<br /><br />His earlier book, The Ascent of Money, argued that banking and finance represent a killer app; but recent events must have dimmed his enthusiasm for them.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was that he offered little constructive advice of how to rescue the West from decline other than revising the History curriculum.
0525478817|5.0|This is why Young Adult fiction is great. Death, humor, life, love, joy and wonder in a plain old good story. I was never more existential than I when I was a teenager, and John Green nails it.  It's laugh-out-loud funny at times, and some of those times are also the darkest, saddest moments. Because that's how life is. These completely fictional folks come to life as examples of how to live, how to die, and most importantly: how to find meaning in the world.  Side note: as a philosophy librarian, the recently departed Phillipa Foot gets a shout out, as does good old Zeno. Nice work, Mr.Green

140053271X|5.0|I love my Nook simple touch but will review another time.  Right now I want to alert everyone not to buy your Simple  Touch from Amazon.  While I love Amazon, I thought I would use my gift cards to purchase my Nook from them rather than going directly to Barnes & Noble.  Was directed to several dealers and selected Ricks Collectibles who had a great rating.  My Nook came quickly and everything seemed OK until I tried to purchase the extended coverage.  Apparently my Nook had been purchased in November at Sears, resold and somehow ended up at Ricks.  Although I purchased it Jan. 3, 30 days had elapsed from the date it was originally purchased it November and I couldn't purchase the service contract.  PLUS, my 1 year warranty actually started in November, so I got gyped there too.  I never realized I was going to run into this trouble when I purchased my Nook and the only reason I bought it this way was to use up my Amazon gift cards.  From what I've read on people's reviews they love the service contract...if they drop their Nook they get a replacement immediately.  If this is important to you....PLEASE DON'T PURCHASE YOUR NOOK FROM AMAZON.

1451627289|5.0|I stopped reading Stephen King's books years ago as I hated the endings. Loved the first 90% and then came the spiders, clowns, hand of God and so on. It took my sister-in-law swearing that this book was different for me to download it.   There were several points near the conclusion where King could have stopped writing but, like in a Spielberg movie, he continued a bit further.  All questions were answered, all loose ends tied up.   If the other reviews regarding the premise peak your interest, know it moves along very briskly with little fluff or other unnecessary padding. Truly a fun read all the way.
B006DDO1D0|3.0|I've been enjoying listening to this recording, as the reader is talented and involved in the story.  Being able to read aloud well is a special, very specific talent, and this guy definitely has it - with one flaw, and to me ear, it's a pretty big one.  In the latter half of the story, there are a number of speaking characters of Russian descent.  Well, apparently the reader (I think his name is Craig Wesson) didn't think it necessary to research what a Russian accent actually sounds like, because he speaks all their lines in a very emphatic AUSTRIAN accent.  Really, it sounds like he's doing an Arnold Schwarzenegger impersonation!  It's irritating beyond belief, and intrudes painfully on the enjoyment I'm getting from the actual story, which is interesting, detailed, and suspenseful.  WHY would an actor being paid to do a 20+ hour reading not bother to check that the accent he's using is the correct one for the characters?  It's not as if it would be hard!  But it seems he's a tad too confident in his abilities, and I'm afraid it's coming close to ruining the chapters where the offending accent appears.  *sigh*  Oh well, as Stephen Wright once said, you can't have everything - where would you put it?

B00006RCNW|5.0|The editorial review of Season 1 of THE SHIELD is so on point! When this series began my cable provider didn't carry F/X so I missed the first two seasons but kept hearing rave reviews about the show, particularly the performance of Michael Chiklis as the amoral detective, Vic Mackey.<br /><br />I was drawn in to this 13-episode season from the beginning as the fast paced storytelling allowed me to get to know the exceptional supporting cast who act as the various \\"planets\\" who gravitate around the burning sun, that is Vic Mackey.  As a viewer I found myself squirming at times as I rooted for Vic & his Strike Team while at the same time hoping for their downfall.<br /><br />As someone who has always enjoyed cop dramas where the leading characters are morally upright and the villains clearly defined, it was quite interesting to watch this series with so many morally ambiguous characters struggling to do the right thing as they define it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This was the case I bought with my Fire about 6 weeks ago. It was very easy to put the Fire inside of it, and I never had any trouble with the elastic strap to keep it shut. The Kindle never once fell out, and it wasn't easy to take it out to change to the Jumi case either. This sucker holds on tight.<br /><br />That being said, I wasn't terribly impressed with the easel function of the case. I don't know if I needed to break in the fold in the cover or what, but I never felt like I could trust it. Any movement sent the Fire flat.<br /><br />It's also not much different than holding a naked Fire when you're reading or playing with your apps for a long period of time. Your hands/wrists get just as tired, which is another reason I switched to the Jumi.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Great game! I would have gave it 5 stars if the game was longer. I hope to see more from the developers of this game.

1878424939|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent and very interesting read.  It really makes you think about how we become the people that we are.  How we are taught through rewards and punishments from birth the rules and laws of life.  This is only one thing you learn from this book.
B0049P1VHS|2.0|Love the story and plot.  Great acting.  Good photography and visuals.  I made it through 3 episodes by closing my eyes at some of the gore.  I also had to resort to plugging my ears during a scene of chopping up a zombie body with an ax that went on forever.  I couldn't watch and all the splattering blood and organs or stand the graphic sound effects.  Too much violence for me..... It would be a 5 star if only there was less gore.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|a lovely story about the desire for closure following a trauma yet absolute powerlessness to speed up that timeline before it's due, both for the main character, our murder victim, and the people she left behind.  This book is a highly imaginative story with striking visual aspects. It is written the wistful dream like state of a 14 year old girl caught between the here and the here after.  In some spots, however the story does feel like it is being dragged out a hair but the totality of it all does make up for the more verbose segments
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have always found it challenging to read fiction, but this series has turned me around.  From the beginning the author draws you into a great storyline.  The suspense keeps you on edge, eagerly awaiting the fate of the main characters.  I read the entire series over the course of a weekend.  I just couldn't pull away from it.  I hope that the movie will do the book justice.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I look for games my kids can play too and while they would be able to play most games the full screen ads pop up every 2 to 3 games you play I am worried they will click on the wrong one and I do not want them seeing or me subscribing/buying any.Also the touch  seamed a little off and hard to control . I am all for ads on free games but that was just ridicules
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is so cool, and different than anything I've ever played before. I almost can't stop. the music is more than acceptable, while most games have music that is very annoying. Well worth the. 99 cents paid for it. Bravo!
B006GG1KOC|2.0|Really? My 4 year old did not like this game. I am glad it was free. It was boring, and some of the levels were too difficult for even me.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its fun at times. But tends to get frustrating. Especially on the games that require you to flick. The points required to open later games get a bit ridiculious as well.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Literally and figuratively a snap to install, this lightweight but effective case for Kindle Fire is the perfect protection for my new Kindle Fire. The Kindle easily snaps into the case and stays there. If there is a need to remove the Kindle, just snap it out again.   What I like most about this case is that it is so thin, lightweight (yet apparently secure), it makes the Kindle Fire easy to carry (I can even get it into the pocket of slacks, although it might be a challenge in the pocket of your favorite jeans). The cover just rests on the face of the screen to protect it. There is an elastic strap that pulls double duty as the means of keeping the cover either open or closed and the same elastic can be used to slip your fingers through for a more positive grip on the case when reading. A nice touch is the velvet-like inner lining of the front cover.  I had purchased locally a leather case by another manufacturer that proved to be too thick and bulky and it covered up the right-hand audio speaker. I took it back the next day and ordered this product from Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love the games and the animation is really cute. It's great for passing time and quality time spent with kids.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Partly it's the narrator--she does the Women's Murder Club series (by James Patterson) well, but her voice is a bit old to be a convincing Katniss--but mostly it's Katniss herself. I'm not completely sold on her as the heroine. She was amazingly dense at times, particularly about her relationships with others, and especially with boys. I realize that this is the trend in YA fiction these days--to have plain, nothing-special girls who just don't realize that a boy (let alone more than one! We should all be so lucky) could possibly like them and be totally in the dark about it, but Katniss took it to a whole new level. Can she really be that oblivious? Since we're getting the story from her POV here, I guess so. I find it hard to swallow, though, because overall she's not an idiot. (She just plays one on reality TV? Sorry, couldn't resist.) Yes, she was good at using what life threw at her to help her get through and yes, overall she showed resourcefulness and bravery. But unless she undergoes some major changes in the next two books (because in this one? She didn't really change at all), she's never going to be in the list of my favorite heroines.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me is that we don't really get a good explanation for what has happened to the country that turned it into the scary place that is Panem. Things are alluded to but never fully explained--or at least not explained in a way that makes it all make sense. Maybe this will be fixed in the next two books? I hope so, but won't be holding my breath....
1400159849|4.0|This book is amazing. The narrator is beyond irritating. Its like on auto-read but worse. Always check who the narrator is, and avoid Karen White.

B004OBQDHK|5.0|Point Break is a totally unapologetic action movie. It is superbly paced, beautifully shot, and the action is really well choreographed.  What's in it? There's fighting. There's surfing. There's fighting while surfing. There's a car chase. There's a foot chase. There's shooting. There's fire. There's skydiving. There's beach football. There's bank-robbing. There's partying. There's changing clothes under a towel on the beach. There's even a running lawnmower used as a weapon. This is all done *really well*.  How can it miss?  It only misses if you, mistakenly, expect Keanu Reeves to be a great actor. So stop that. You know better, so enjoy the film.  Everyone else in the film does a *great* job, and that includes Gary Busey and John C McGinley (who chews the scenery *wonderfully* -- I'm sure he was asked to do so). Patrick Swayze outshines the rest of the cast, but that's partly because he has the most interesting role.  In this film, the script is an *action vehicle*. The flick looks great on Blu-ray, and the film holds up well after 20 years -- much better than a film like \\"Top Gun\\". Grab some popcorn and have a good time.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|It's one of my favorite movies that will be a classic and is ideal to keep in collection. I recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app....some of the games are almost impossible to play....other ones are great. The nice thing is there are plenty to choose from!
0525478817|5.0|I so wish that I could adequately describe just what The Fault in Our Stars did to me. John was certainly right to say the book would make me feel \\"All of the feelings!!!!\\" because I most certainly did during the 4 hours I sat down in my room to read this novel beginning to end. One minute, I would be sad about Hazel's condition and the next I would forget entirely that she was a girl living with cancer. Other moments I would be engulfed by sadness and crying uncontrollably and suddenly Hazel or Augustus would marvel me with their amazing wit and humor and I would be laughing while crying.  Do not deny yourself the pleasure of reading this book just because the protagonist is a teenager with cancer. I can assure this book is much more about LIVING than it is about dying.   Did I feel sad while reading certain parts? Absolutely. It was impossible not to given the situation and my complete love of the characters. Did my viewpoint on life change after reading this book? It most certainly did. I would go so far as to say that if you read this book and it does not make you evaluate your life, the way you live it, and the people in it than you must have gotten some erroneous copy of the novel.   It has been years since I have read a book that has made such an impact on me as an individual and the way I see my place in the world. I'm not saying that I haven't read good books in the past few years (I mean, I read the Hunger Games trilogy 2 years ago and I love it nearly as much as Harry Potter) but none of the books I've read recently have made me feel quite like this one.   Please do yourself the favor of reading this novel. I have already recommended it to everyone I know so now I recommend it to you, dear stranger of the interweb reading this post. I do hope you listen and are able to gain as much from this novel as I was.

B006GG1KOC|4.0|First off...I am quite frustrated with this I/Me society that we are living in. Rating a free app a one star just because you cant use it or don't get anything out of it is ridiculous! Shame on all of you for being so selfish! Amazon is doing a great thing by offering free apps to all different ages and interests. Great job Amazon!  Now for the real reason for doing a review (which I should spell out for some of you-obviously-is to actually rate the game for info for others to decide if this might be a good app for them). I enjoyed the game and my daughter does also. I agree there should be an explanation for why certain things don't belong, because I wasn't sure in some myself. That would help us parents be able to explain to our children why they may have gotten the wrong answer. But that's the only thing I believe could be improved upon. And to the person who insulted all parents who let their kids play on their phones/kindles etc...many parents download educational apps to do with their child. So please don't insult people that you don't know just because you aren't happy about the app of the day.

0143119680|5.0|This was purchased through Amazon. I really enjoyed this book.  It catches your attention right at the beginning and continues to keep your interest.  There was only one part that I thought got a bit long was after Matthew and Diana go to upstate New York to try to get away from being harassed for being together which goes against an ancient rule.  The characters in the book also kept your interest and there were many that were brought in the main story while the secrets were discovered.  The whole book was written over a period of a little over a month with 2 more books to follow.  I am looking foward to the next installment.

B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a great program, but it is far from seamless. For some reason the screen resolution on my  pc  would change when I started the program. Why? Another issue is with an error message regarding the sampling rate of the audio. I wasn't even streaming audio to my tab,so it shouldn't have mattered. But the message kept interrupting me numerous times. So if they iron out these issues it would be a seamless. Great program.

0440245915|5.0|A Time to Kill, by John Grisham isa book set in the twentieth century American South. A brief summary of the plot is that two men brutally rape and beat 10-year old Tonya Hailey. Although they are both arrested, it appears that they will both be given a light, minimal sentence. For repeated accounts of rape, they will possibly serve only nine years in prison. It looks like they'll both be punished lightly until Carl Lee Hailey, the girls father kills them both. What ensues is nothing short of moral chaos. All of this would be easily sorted out except for one factor: Carl Lee Hailey is black, and the entire jury is white.    Two things that I loved about this book was how the author, John Grisham, weaves his tail so that as a reader you have empathy with the characters. As I read this book, I could feel a moral battle raging inside of me as I felt different parts of my conscience struggle to decide If I thought that Hailey was guilty. This is a very powerful book, and It has had a profound impact on me; really making me examine my conscience and the impact that discrimination and racism have in our modern world. The second is that once I started reading, I could barely put this book down, Grisham's plot is entertaining while at the same time being very informative. It is this which differentiates him from writers like Tom Clancy, whose inclusion of redundant facts borders on criminal. At the same time, the plot is believable and thrilling, I believe that it is a near perfect combination of fact and fiction.    One of the few reasons to dislike this book is that if compared to his other works like The Firm and The Client, A Time to Kill is much shorter. In fact, while it is more complex than many pieces of literature (twilight) it is still nowhere near as convoluted and contorted as the plots in the previously mentioned novels. This is simply a warning for fans of his earlier books, this one is a little bit quicker to finish.    I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and if you are in the mood for some realistic legal fiction, with a twist of morality; read this book. Not only will it cause you to think about the plot, but it will most likely cause you to look inside of yourself and face the chaotic moral dilemma that is the world we live in.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a very entertaining game for people of all ages!!! I love it, everyone in my family love it aswell.

0525478817|5.0|I never thought I could have my heart broken by anything other than another living soul, but The Fault in Our Stars proved me wrong completely. This is the first book in a long time that I simply not put down, and for good reason: both the writing and the storyline pulled me in from the first paragraph. The tale of love and loss pales all others that I have read, which is more than a few. John said that he hoped that we, the readers, would feel as if we transcended the limits of ourselves while reading this - I felt that and so much more.

B005VR9328|5.0|Veteran hip-hop group The Roots are one of few hip-hop groups that use a live band setting. Their fusion of the sensibilities of hip-hop and the live aspect of soul make the Roots one of the `gems' and rarities in the hip-hop circle. 2011 Concept album [[ASIN:B006A819AG Undun [Explicit] [+Digital Booklet]]] is one of the Roots most intriguing releases as of late, delivering an amalgam of style-infused rap varying from the introspective to gospel-infused cuts. A suite, entitled \\"Redford Suite\\" closes out the album in four distinct movements sans rap in alternative, classical, and jazz styles.  Only a group with the musical intellect and savvy of the Roots could pull of one of the years most interesting and best albums. Undun ranks right up there at the top.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Dun,\\" which possesses a mysterious timbre, given way to the experimental vibe of Undun.  The lush synthetic pads are a solid instrumental way to start off this conceptual masterpiece.  \\"Sleep\\" continues the momentum with uniqueness comparable to the opener.  The production is minimalist, yet captivating with the drums/drum programming being a highlight.  Aaron Earl Livingston provides a solid set of vocals, as conceptual as the production work itself.  Black Thought caps off the cut with a solid set of rhymes, establishing the mood for the album as a whole.  The exceptional first single \\"Make My,\\" featuring Big K.R.I.T. & Dice Raw is valedictory in all senses of the word.  A nice choppy synthetic pad is featured in the beginning, eventually evolving into a lush sounding Electric Piano-like patch.  The drum groove is incredibly soulful once it enters in.  Big K.R.I.T. delivers a fiery first verse: \\"Addicted to the green, if I don't ball I'll get the shakes/I'd give it all for peace of mind, for heaven's sake...\\" Black Thought delivers a cerebral intense verse as well: \\"Tryin' to control the fits of panic/unwritten and unraveled, it's the dead man's pedantic...\\" The hook caps off the sensation cut: \\"They told me that the ends/won't justify the means/they told me at the end/don't justify the dreams...\\" Undun gets off to a very fast start.<br /><br />\\"One Time,\\" featuring Dice Raw & Phonte keeps the pace going strong, accentuated by its big drums and overall gargantuan sound about the production work.  Mercedes Martinez & Tracey Moore provide sound harmonized background vocals, which is an additional highlight.  The hook is as solid as any, packing a heavy punch: \\"I was always late for the bus/just once can I be on time/then I start to think what's the rush/who wants to be on time...\\" \\"Kool On\\" samples the DJ Rogers cut \\"Where There's a Will (There's A Way),\\" delivering yet another sensational listen.  Black Thought (Verse 2) is joined by Greg Porn (Verse 1) and Truck North (Verse 3), who provide solid rhymes. \\"The OtherSide\\" features Bilal Oliver on vocals and Greg Porn on yet another verse.  As dramatic and emotional as any other cut, the Roots continue to deliver strongly.  Bilal's verse is certainly affecting: \\"We're all on a journey/down the hall of memories/don't worry bout what you ain't got/leave with a bit of dignity...but when I make it to the other side, make it to the other side...\\"<br /><br />\\"Stomp\\" adds Greg Porn once more, who delivers a fiery, pointed verse: \\"...immaculate conceptions/now what's beef ain't even a question/calico kisses, cold blood and crime tape/flirt with death, every night it's a blind date...\\" Black Thought continues to compel.  The production work is perhaps the biggest highlight, notable for its guitar work and ostinato acoustic piano patch.  Just Blaze handles all `interlude' parts, which is a nice touch.  \\"Lifehouse,\\" featuring Dice Raw keeps things rolling in high fashion, as does \\"I Remember,\\" which once more features Mercedes Martinez & Tracey Moore providing solid background vocals.  \\"Tip The Scale,\\" once again featuring Dice Raw, is nothing short of superb. The harmonic progression by the band is smart and the huge drums are breathtaking (live drums).  The musicianship of the band would be enough to drive \\"Tip the Scale,\\" but also Black Thought and Dice Raw do nothing short of slaughter their rhymes. Black Thought dominates with great lines the caliber of \\"...Rob Peter to pay Paul/now I realize it's the winner that takes all...\\" while Dice Raw is on autopilot with such lines as \\"I got a brother on the run and one in/wrote me a letter he said when you coming...\\"<br /><br />The album ends with the odd, though stunning  instrument Redford Suite, which closes album in four short movements.  Sufjan Steven handles the first movement, \\"Redford\\" (for Yia Yia & Pappou).  Stevens incorporates the minimalistic ideals he's came to be known for.  \\"Possibility (2nd Movement)\\" uses acoustic piano in tandem with live strings to give off a very introspective sound.  The most captivating movement is \\"Will to Power,\\" which features virtuoso jazz pianist D.D. Jackson creating chaotic cacophony with ?uestlove on drums - it is musicianship at its highest level.  \\"Finality\\" closes the moving suite with strings and a tone clusters in the lower register after the strings finish their tender chorale.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B006A819AG Undun [Explicit] [+Digital Booklet]]] is easily one the very best albums of 2011.  The Roots have more of a cult following than anything at this point in their careers, but no one should miss out on the strength and incredible musicianship hosted by Undun. Highly recommended.athtaking (live drums).  The musicianship of the band would be enough to drive \\"Tip the Scale,\\" but also Black Thought and Dice Raw do nothing short of slaughter their rhymes.

B004Y1USJE|5.0|Fly From Here has been subject to some incredibly polarizing reviews. I think the primary reason for this is that there are numerous dichotomies between the album and the litany of listener expectations and emotions. There are extensive factors outside of the music that are a challenge to reconcile, such as an allegiance to Jon Anderson, Yes' history and brand name, the emergence of so-called neo-prog and the expectations of Trevor Horn among others. With all of these factors to consider it is quite difficult to review Fly From Here based solely on the 47-plus minutes of music presented.<br /><br />This is an album that contextually sounds closer to the neo-prog movement than classic early-70's Yes albums. This could present a confusing experience for some listeners because modern progressive acts wear influences, such as Yes, on their sleeves. If a different band were to have released this album there may be a listener reaction similar to that which greeted Starcastle's eponymous release in 1976. Starcastle borrowed the Yes sound liberally, but sounded more contemporary. Except, Fly From Here is a Yes album that sounds more modern within the context of the progressive rock scene in 2011. We certainly cannot accuse Yes of plagiarizing the Yes sound.... Can we?<br /><br />Certainly Yes and Jon Anderson were an influence on vocalist Benoît David; they have been an influence on just about anyone who has listened to this genre of music. A number of reviewers have lamented the similarity between the two vocalists and I believe Jon Anderson even accused Yes of just hiring a younger version of himself. While it is true that both vocalists sing in a high register, in my view the criticism is unfair as I think Benoît David has his own style, more range and an overall stronger voice than Jon Anderson, particularly evident in his work with Mystery. I think that Jon Anderson's voice, even if bottled from 20 years ago, would not have been successful on Fly From Here. With that said, Benoît David does not have the spirit and fragility of Jon Anderson which was so critical to the classic Yes albums. Both singers fit into the Yes mold, but present different strengths. It certainly seems as though Jon Anderson was unfairly cast away, but this is a review of Fly From Here and its performers; I will not knock a star off because of my personal feelings about Yes' alleged personnel dealings.<br /><br />What I can say about Fly From Here is that I am captivated by the album. It is a deeply moving complete body of work that is solidified by incredibly strong musicianship, sophistication, energy and passion. There is a sense of urgency that propels these songs that Yes has not exhibited for a very long time. It is extremely difficult to compare or rank this along side the rest of the Yes cannon, but if pushed I would place it in their top 3 or 4. It is tempting to compare Fly From Here to 90125 because the band pursued a more modern change in direction on both efforts, but in my view this album is more consistent and an overall stronger effort. For listeners willing and able to accept Fly From Here on its own terms, this is arguably the best Yes album since Going For The One or perhaps even Close to the Edge.does not have the spirit and fragility of Jon Anderson which was so critical to the classic Yes albums. Both singers fit into the Yes mold, but present different strengths. It certainly seems as though Jon Anderson was unfairly cast away, but this is a review of Fly From Here and its performers; I will not knock a star off because of my personal feelings about Yes' alleged personnel dealings.  What I can say about Fly From Here is that I am captivated by the album. It is a deeply moving complete body of work that is solidified by incredibly strong musicianship, sophistication, energy and passion.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|Despite other reviews for this book, I found it to be whimsical and a book I will enjoy reading over and over again. An intriguing challenge turns into something completely unexpected. If you feel the beginning is going slowly, hang in there for the ride of a life time. The characters seem as though they are long lost friends or relatives. The Night Circus is a compelling story with just the right amount of mystery and unexpected turns, yet the familiarity of your favorite rainy day read.

0525478817|5.0|I pre-ordered this book and received a signed copy on its release date of January 10. I finished it in the same day, many hours and tears later. Since it is only the 11th now, I realize there are still countless people who are probably still waiting for their copies or have not finished reading it yet, so I will not ruin the experience with spoilers in this review.<br /><br />This book is simply a book about living. It is about laughter, heartache, love, beauty, fear, loss, death, illness, health, luck, adversity, knowledge, happiness, fate, companionship, and pain. It is a work of fiction that rings as true as life itself. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already familiar with John Green's work, but especially to those who are not.

1401207529|5.0|BATMAN: YEAR ONE by Frank Miller intrigues and excites in this thrilling graphic novel.<br /><br />A young Bruce Wayne sees the decay of Gotham City as his personal challenge. He must discover how to keep his identity secret while cleaning up the streets of Gotham. While Batman strikes fear in criminals, Lieutenant James Gordon juggles his ethics and the police corruption and a new villainess is born: Catwoman.<br /><br />As a long-time Batman fan, BATMAN: YEAR ONE is the perfect entrance into reading graphic novels. David Mazzucchelli's illustrations are an added dimension to the storyline. Each picture makes the characters come to life. Miller's dialogue gives just enough information that the reader can follow the story. It's reminiscent of a cross between the old Batman show with Adam West and the newer Batman movies directed by Christopher Nolan. It's gritty, dark, sometimes funny and sarcastic. It's everything a Batman lover would want to read and a good introduction to Batman for those who haven't followed Gotham's Dark Knight.<br /><br />Frank Miller's BATMAN: YEAR ONE is a must-read for Batman fans. Also, if you've never picked up a graphic novel before, like me, then it's a great one to read.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|The worst problem with the app is the insane amount of points needed to open new games ie 180,000 to open one level three game. there are around 16 to open thats 2,880,000 points needed.  To advance you have to download new partner games to get mega points or play the low scoring games a million times over to get more points (they average around 8,000 points per game. minus sudoko which is around 17,000).. I beat every game in the first level and was out of points by the middle of the second level. I understand the developer need $, but the point system is way out of whak.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|This game doesn't have much to it. My 5 year old finished it in ten minutes. It won't entertain for long.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|WOW, I am very impressed!  This unit is compact and built of solid materials.  I connected it and had it working in about 2 minutes!  I checked all over the internet and this is the only unit I could find of its kind to do what I needed.  I just bought a Google TV box that only has HDMI out, my TV only has optical audio out, and my older (but very good) receiver only has RCA inputs.  I called 12 local electronics stores in search of this solution and 11 said nothing like it existed.  The remaining store told me that it would cost $600-$800.  Be sure to place the input selector toggle switch in the correct position for your input type (coaxial or optical) and it will work just fine!
B0000CD5I6|5.0|I purchased this during christmas week and have listened to it off and on since.  The album grows on you and it is really well mixed and the songs are presented really well.  A must for any Jethro Tull.Ian Anderson fan colection.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|First, the wand works exactly as advertised.  It's a remote control for your television/cable box/etc.  The wand allows you to do 13 separate things (there are 13 different motions).  That's enough to turn things on, shift channels, change volume up and down, etc. All you really NEED for 90% of what you do with your television.  But the reason it was a favorite at my house this year is that I've got three JK Rowling fans that were in love with the idea of having a real magic wand.  Heck, they were happy just training with the different motions of the thing, probably wouldn't have really cared if it didn't do anything else but give you some vibration feedback pulses when you got the different motions correct.  Strongly recommend this if you've got a would-be wizard in the family.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Seen my friends play it at 1st lunch... is epic, remembered i had money on account so i bought it
B004ZJZPXO|3.0|I watched all the episode of Firefly after 8 years later, but glad I did as one of my friend referred to the series. So I had to follow up with the movie edition, Serenity. I thought this was a great deal blue-ray + digital copy, but the downside of it the delivery takes forever. Even though I upgraded to a 2 day shipping. Interesting is I can get diapers to deliver within one day and blue-ray 2 weeks?!  3 stars for blue-ray  0 stars for amazon delivery
B006GG1KOC|4.0|My nieces will get a kick out of this game. Some differences are harder than others,  but that's exactly why I like it, it will teach them to think and to look everywhere, even for the most minute differences. Would have been nice to maybe have 5, 6, or even 7 objects on screen at once to determine the difference.
0439023521|5.0|This books grabs on and won't let go.  I had a hard time going to sleep after I started this book and now I'm waiting for the UPS man to bring the rest of the series.  Buy it!!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I LOVE this series. I seriously couldn't put the books down. I finished the trilogy in a week and I have already re-read them once. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves action packed novels with a good romance twist :)
B005KMX866|4.0|Thanx Chris for your joyful music, it's so good that remind me to sunny beach, palm trees and everything has the flavour of a party.

B003CN5B6K|5.0|I like this TV series a lot. It's like catch me if you can but episodic. I like the resolution of this and cant wait to pick up the second season. btw- the supporting cast is pretty good too.
1451627289|5.0|I was rivited within the first few pages. This novel is such a good read I just couldn't put it down. Even with 2 short lunch breaks I finished it in 1 day. (albeit 2am) It was that good!  A present day school teacher named Jake learns of a portal in time that will return him back to late 1958. In collaboration with a small store owner, in whose shop the portal resides, they both make enough jaunts back in time to realize that the past does not like to be changed and every new trip back resets time to the way it was originally. But like in the \\"Butterfly Effect\\" every change that's made no matter how small also changes the future course of history. Thus Jake embarks on a 5 year stay in 1958 to try to prevent the assisination of JFK.  An easy read with excellent character development you feel like you're right back in 1958 without cell phones or computers and breathing that nice fresh clean air. Readers in their late 50s and older will especially like this book as they lived these events through radio and black & white television. Many of the buildings, shops, and street names mentioned are still there today.  The ending is quite moving and not what you'd expect from a horror writer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing games!!!! so if you like games this is for you!!!!! but the game has so many adds in the middle of the games
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|found out my new 3D tv has a problem. although some of the 3D could have been better. overall it is pretty good.  i can now recommend it.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I love Brad Pitt and always watch his movies, and I'm rarely disappointed, and wasn't this time. Moneyball is a great movie based on a true story, you don't have to be into baseball to get the movie but it does help if you know a little. The story was really good and gives the viewer an understanding of how hard it is for small budget major league baseball teams to compete with teams like the Yankees and others where money is no object. I really enjoyed this film, great story and acting.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|When I first saw the previews for Rise of the Planet of the Apes, I was pretty skeptical.  I figured special effects and whatnot would be pretty good with modern technology, but I wasn't too sure about the story.  I decided to wait and rent this first, but in the end, after having watched it, I am glad to say that it really was pretty good.  I wouldn't say it was totally epic, but it was pretty enjoyable overall.  This is basically the story of how the initial group of apes became smarter and began their rise towards domination.  It also goes on to show how mankind would begin descending (because let's face it, a simple pack of apes clearly couldn't take over the world), but there is an element within the movie that inevitably brings that about.  I don't want to say too much, because I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this who hasn't seen it yet.  All in all, this movie is totally worth at least a watch, if not a buy.  Check it out!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Its very easy to use. No excessive frills.  And excellent support from the developer. I had reported a problem on 1st Jan and it was fixed the next day! Awesome!!
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|I have seen better vampire movies, but this one wasn't all too bad.  It was kinda of an interesting new take on the whole vampire thing...a world overrun by vampires, which actually seemed more like a cross between vampires and zombies.  They sucked blood just like vampires, but they were a bit more of slightly brainless drones who overall were unable to speak...and the whole apocalyptic side of this movie also made me think zombie.  I guess you could just call them zombie vampires or something.  One of the antagonists in this movie was somehow able to speak after he became a zombie vampire...not sure what's up with that, but for the most part they could not speak.  They were more like wild animals hunting out their next pray.  I was a little preturbed about a baby and a pregnant woman that got ate, but I guess it's a bit more realistic in a way, because in a vampire/zombie apocalypse such as this, I doubt they would be choosy  about who they would go after, as long as they got their blood/brains.  If you're into vampire and/or zombie movies, then I recommend giving this one a try.  It's worth at least a watch.
B001AQR3E4|2.0|[[ASIN:B001AQR3E4 Interview with the Vampire [Blu-ray]]]<br /><br />I had a few extra dollars on an Amazon gift card and hadn't seen this movie in some time. It fit the amount I had left to spend so I ordered it to add to my new Blu-Ray collection. While I enjoyed the movie as much as I remembered, the disc did not meet the high standards I've come to expect from Blu-Ray. No popup menu, no real selection of features, and a video transfer that would be acceptable on a budget DVD, but not in 1080p. The intro by the director looks like a worn VHS tape. It's certainly watchable, but I expected much better. I got a movie I wanted to enjoy again in pretty good picture instead of amazing Blu-Ray picture.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|Come on its not that bad there are a few sets that aren't great and maybe even wrong but the idea is good and it's for kids so I think it should say the difference b4 moving to the next even if you get the answer correct on anything other than the 1st guess I Wish I could give it 3.5 stars instead of 3 if someone puts this is the best app on there phone LOL there challenged or getn paid and that's the truth so let your kids play but be prepared to explain that a whale is a mammal or that carrots aren't as sweet as water melon, cake, or lollipops because the game won't and sometimes it's a stretch only a few tho
0811879542|4.0|We learned about this book at the local library for story time.  As soon as story time was over, my 4 year old immediately went up to the librarian and asked to have this book.  We checked it out to take home.  Kept it for over 2 months!  He really enjoyed reading this book himself and with mama!
B000002G9S|5.0|Free are one of those groups that were too brief, yet were a wonder to behold within British based blues/rock. Fire and Water is the 3rd offering from this extremely talented and deep band of players. Paul Kossoff provided a voice within the band as his Les Paul vibrato translates working within perfect tandem with the soulful and propelling voice of one Paul Rodgers. Backed by the solid and powerhouse drumming of Simon Kirke and the driving melodic bass playing of Andy Fraser, the opening title cut amplifies these aforementioned qualities to the hilt. Within the 8 track cycle of this album, you can hear where the band have defined and honed their style of blues rock and is a notch above the previous self-titled second album and their debut Tons of Sobs; tracks like Remember, Oh I Wept and Heavy Load all display the power of the cohesiveness of Free whilst displaying throughout the songs durations, each members' power of themselves individually.   Mr Big and All Right Now are the classics from this set and each are unique and volatile in their own ways. Mr Big is a tour de-force dyed-in the wool blues/rocker that has an uncanny menace and depth within its near 6 minute length; it gives Kossoff and Fraser room to improvise and solo within and without one another into a mystifying mirage of sound. All Right Now remains an FM staple and is justly considered as one of the top Rock songs of all time; it has a struttin' beat coupled with a killer guitar riff from Koss, followed up by the slinky bass lines of Fraser and the indelible vocals of Paul Rodgers. Another track of note is the understated, overlooked soul ballad Don't Say You Love Me which provides Free with another angle of creativity and another strong track within the Fraser/Rodgers songwriting team. Overall, Fire and Water remains Free's most accessible and recognizable piece of rock artistry within their craft. Casual fans will have all they need in Fire and Water, while the more devoted fan will include Highway, the self-titled 2nd release and Free Live! within their respective collections. 5 stars
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Good, works great, use on my laptop, use it in my backyard, and my car. Use it when I am cooking.  ,
B00005Y46O|5.0|Even though by the time of this offering Free had splintered into fragments, what one hears when putting on this disc, is the sound of a great blues/rock outfit in full flight. According to the liner notes in the 2002 remaster, the majority of the album is cut in Sunderland Locarno-Fillmore , whilst some of the bonus material culls tracks from other gigs of the time period(early-mid 1970) in Croydon, (namely Fairfield Hall which has subsquently been issued). The disc opens with the hit All Right Now and begins a rockin' set that never lets up until the strains of the tender, wistful studio track Get Where I Belong ends the record. In between those bookended songs lay the crucial mettle that was within Free's blues/rock apex; live renditions of I'm a Mover, Fire and Water, Ride on a Pony and Be My Friend are rendered even better in live performance and prove that Free were just as good, if not greater in concert than on their studio releases. The main numbers that stand out particularly, are Mr. Big(a showcase for Kossoff and Fraser) and the band's infamous rendering of Albert King's The Hunter which was a huge crowd pleaser and features one of Paul Rodger's most arresting vocals ever to adorn vinyl.  As mentioned earlier, the bonus tracks culled feature a few numbers from a concert in Croydon, Fairfield Halls and offer songs from Free's self-titled 2nd release, in the forms of Woman, Trouble on Double Time and Moonshine. The last 3 tracks are different versions of Mr. Big, All Right Now and an alternate mix of the studio cut, Get Where I Belong. Free Live! is absolutely essential listening to anyone whom is a fan of early 70's blues/rock and is a fitting statement as to the power of Free as a band, even though they had a short span, they made some magnificent music and undoubtably left a major mark within the annals of rock history....5 Big Stars

B000EAT246|3.0|I remember watching this movie a quarter of a century ago and marveled at how incredibly futuristic the Blue Thunder helicopter was, convinced it had to be the work of super talented special effects people. Some time later, I learned it was an actual US military helicopter that was used and that got me even more excited because I had thought it could do all the things depicted in the movie. I mean, silent mode and turbine boost? So realistically done too. Now, I just chuckle at how foolish I was having watched the movie again. Naturally, it wasn't quite as fun as when I watched it many years ago, still, it had some pretty nifty aerial combat sequences featuring some very low flying urban chase scenes and special effects that were way too good for its time. I would have given this movie 5 stars back then but only 3 today. Definitely worth watching if you like helicopters the slightest bit.

No sacred cows here, just honest reporting of how the individuals including George Martin, behaved in the studio. Being a musician and recording engineer myself, it was amazing to read how they worked their magic in those days. HIGHLY recommended!

B00170DEM8|5.0|Watch Holiday Inn every Christmas with the family.  It wouldn't be Christmas without this wonderful film.  Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are terrific in this warm and delightful film.  This feel good movie is one of a kind.  I wish they still made movies this good.
B006GG1KOC|2.0|I am aware that this game is for smaller children. However, upon playing this game up to certain levels, even I don't understand what isn't supposed to belong. Sometimes it just seems like they grouped a bunch of random things and expect you to pick out one that doesn't belong. Just wish it would tell you why it doesn't belong.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I'll keep it short and sweet. I love time-travel movies and my wife loves \\"chick-flicks.\\" This movie offers both in abundance. Great movie. I watched it twice within a matter of days. Loved it!  The old saying, \\"The grass is always greener on the other side of the fence\\" applies to this movie. We all tend to have nostalgic feelings, probably misplaced and skewed, of a time in the past; either our own past or further back, when things were better. The main character gets the chance to find out for himself...  I'd recommend getting this in Blue Ray - a few of the night scenes; including smokey bars, are a bit hazy plus I'd just like to see the beauty of Paris in the highest clarity possible.  Also, keep a cultural dictionary or encyclopedia (or have Wikipedia ready on your laptop): You are going to hear a lot of artists (painters, singers, writers, movie producers, musicians, etc.) mentioned that unless you are an Art Major, will leave you wondering, \\"Where have I heard that name before?\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|With this many mini games it's expected that no one can like every one. Unfortunately for my wrist I am a completionist. There are some I've found addicting, some that bore me, and some that frustrate me. The one consistent thing is how ridiculously high the point requirements to unlock games get as you go.
B005OK721G|5.0|Great action movie!  Zoe saldana,was born to play  the role .... loved the plot and story line.  Lennie james is an underrated actor, hope to see more from him in the near future. Two thumbs up !!!!!!!!!!
B005OK725M|2.0|I held out as long as I could but was forced to watch this anticipated mess by my teenage son.  Even he didn't like it.  Sure, Zoe Saldana is easy on the eyes and she comes pretty close to being nekked, but really?  I had a hard time buying this lithe young woman of about 90 pounds being able to take out swarms of bad guys.  She does it mostly with guns and other explosive weapons, a couple of which are bigger than she is.  Anyway, Cataleya (Saldana) is named after a type of orchid.  She manages to find time to leave a signature of this at each of her professional kills.<br /><br />As a girl of about 10, she sees her parents gunned down in Columbia by the head of a local cartel.  She escapes the killing, not by getting away quickly, but by waiting at the kitchen table until the cartel squad leader comes in and tries to negotiate with her instead of shooting her.  Now she decides to escape, but not without stabbing him in the hand.  The girl then dodges all of the acrobatic goons in a series of parkour rooftop chases.  The girl manages to get to the American Embassy in Bogot&aacute; and trades a microchip for safe passage to Miami.  Once in Miami, she escapes her handler and gets to Chicago somehow to find her uncle.  Yeah, I know.  Uncle Emilio (Cliff Curtis) is a mob enforcer.  Young Cat (Amandia Stenberg) wants to be a trained killer.  Uncle Emilio wants her to go to school first, and then become a killer.  To prove his prowess as a killer himself, he demonstrates outside the school.  As a Lincoln Towncar comes cruising down the street, Emilio pulls out his trusty .45 and shoots at the car which careens into a fire hydrant.<br /><br />As a grownup we see Cataleya plow into a police car at about 50 mph, pretending to be a drunk driver.  This so she can be arrested and placed in the same jail that will soon contain one of the guys responsible for her parents death.  My head is starting to hurt now.  Director Olivier Megaton, no stranger to bad movies (\\"Transporter 3\\"), empties the budget and explosive warehouse in the final act which is just as ludicrous as the entire film.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer looks terrific.  Much of the film was shot on location in Mexico (subbing for Columbia), Chicago and New Orleans.  The DTS-HD surround is excellent.  When all hell breaks loose, the surrounds and sub snap to attention.and explosive warehouse in the final act which is just as ludicrous as the entire film.    The Blu ray transfer looks terrific.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Must have! Accurate, straight forward, and full of info. The other weather apps don't compare and best of all it's free!
B000FVE3AC|5.0|This is a great watch. I've always wanted at least one big, thick and heavy watch and this one one will probably last a lifetime. I wear it around the house and out and about. Don't wear it sleeping as it's weight is heavy enough to cut off your arm's circulation overnight, otherwise it's great for those of us who want to wear a big bold watch to match our egos and personalities.<br /><br />The only improvement that I would recommend is for Invicta to improve it's customer service and address the inability of watch owners to register their watches online for the warranty that it comes with.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|some games are toooo hard but is a great game it needs cheaper games too I bet you will like this game
B006GG1KOC|1.0|1 star cause its free. but not even really worth that. like 5 minuts of play time if your lucky.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game, could use a few more options, like different colors or sounds.  For a free game, it still has a lot to offer.
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|The Blue Ray version is an execellent update of the OST.  There are nice extras as well.  The only probably I hade was that the cases that hold the DVD's came in damaged and this was not due to shipping because the shipping box was in prestine condition.  All the DVD's were fine.  Watch and enjoy the Orignal Star Trek on a big screen TV.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good solitaire game. I like that I can just click a card and have it move. I haven't tried the different scoring methods, but it's good to know they're supported. I also like the statistics, but am not happy with my percentage of games won...
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app. Keeps me on top of all weather conditions. I use it every day for both local and conditions where my sons live.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|excellent game on my kindle, if somewhat frustrating that i can't review cut scenes if i miss something.  loving it so far.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|very user friendly and lots of plans tochoose from. However, one version I read had some horrible mispelling and grammar issues.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice graphics.  Easy to read.  All of the important information is presented on a logical manner.  Easy to switch between cities and save the ones you care about.  Could not ask for much more in a weather app.

B006GG1KOC|5.0|I rated this with five (5) stars, not because it deserved that many but to rather off-set the people who rater this game a one (1) star for trivial reasons. One such reason I saw was because this game was a children's game and not a adult game. Just because you pay the phone bill, this doesn't mean that Amazon has to provide you with a free adult app every week. Some of us have children as well and we pay our own phone bills too. And lastly Amazon doesn't even have to give away free apps. They just do. If you don't like a game, don't play it. Rate it for what it truly is meant for, not because you're upset that today's free app wasn't an adult app. All in all this game is really good and not too difficult. It could be fun for the casual, 'adult' gamer but it is geared more for the early  elementary child. Enjoy either way.
B005HS4CUY|5.0|Prompt delivery.  Already owned 2D version.  Purchased 3D trilogy after purchasing a 3D TV.  Some scenes in 3D were great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think it is a good game couse you get so much games for free 117 I love it. yay
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved these books! The \\"1984\\" feel was unmistakeable. These are the kinds of books that change how you see things and what could be possible in our world  when people become apathetic towards how the government controls our lives. I know these are probably not intended to be a political commentary, but I can't help but see the connection with the changes and the direction our country is going in. Would you want to live in Panem? Be careful of those who want to give the government more power, these books show us what could happen.
0142427837|5.0|Am I the ONLY one who thinks this book is the granddaddy (sorry Stephen!) to The Hunger Games? I read The Long Walk as a 1970's small town teen & it has haunted me ever since. I can still recall how sick to my stomach I got when the brothers sat down in the middle of the road. How I cheered the one kid who ran into the crowd for one last \\"fling\\" or how white knuckled I became during that last turn on the highway. My son recently moved into his 1st apartment as a sophomore in college. Last night he called and asked if I had any good books to read because he was not used to the quiet. For some reason, I immediately thought of this book. Just placed my order and can't WAIT for it to get here. I am very anxious to see if he will love it as much as his mother did 35+ years ago. I hope it gives him much food for thought....sooooooo much more food that ANY Hunger Games!!!
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Great movive's, good price and fast delivery. Amazon is so easy to use. copy's transfer is to my Iphone. Quality is great
B005K17RU0|5.0|Loaded onto my Kindle Fire and I love the app.  No issues.  I really like the graphics and having all of the options available at the bottom of the screen.
B000F8DB4O|5.0|Everything was Great, love the album.Love Pat Matheny Cost was also great.would use this service again,service was very good.Thanks. Will enjoy for many years.
0439023491|5.0|I read The Hunger Games in less than a day, and as soon as I was done I picked up Catching Fire and read it in just a few hours. Not quite as captivating as The Hunger Games, but it is a direct continuation and provides many new exciting twists. I highly recommend reading this series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it. Love the new layout even more. Easy to upload my notes and have them available across devices. Tags are easy to create and apply. It helps keep me organized and my thoughts clear.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a gun fun fun game.  I really like playing this game.  it keeps my brain working and my eyes a looking.
B005QI4TP8|5.0|This was my first Florence and the Machine CD but definitely won't be my last!  This is a fantastic CD!  Florence's voice is amazingly strong and clear.  You will want to play this music through your best stereo system and crank it loud.  Fantastic!
B006GG1KOC|4.0|ok... agree with prev reviews stating some answers are wierd and an option to hear an explanation would be great

1594630844|5.0|What are some of the major lessons drawn from this group of over one- thousand interviews with elderly Americans? There is advice about love and marriage . We are told it is wise to go slow in picking a mate, to choose a mate carefully, to look beyond appearances and to understand that Marriage must be a two- way proposition. One of the interviewees who talks about her second marriage says the key element was sharing values and a way of seeing the world.<br />In regard to raising children there is advice about the price which is paid for playing favorites, a price which may be exacted throughout a person's lifetime. Attention of course must be paid, and doing things with one's children, giving them Time is extremely important. There is the advice of treating each child as an individual and understanding them as an individual. Parents of grown- up children are advised to avoid interfering. Parents are recommended to be on the same page and show consistency in their messages to their children.<br />Advice about Work centers on the person's finding the thing they love to do, and devoting themselves to it wholeheartedly. One responder spoke about the importance of humility, willingness to learn from others. Young people are advised to take time and learn what their true purpose in work is.<br />In regard to Money there is much about the mistake of overvaluing accumulation of possessions. Comparisons are made to the Depression Era and people speak of the capacity to be happy with little and less. This connects well with another major message of the book. Happiness is according to the Advice given here not caused by a situation but made by an attitude. It is in many cases a decision and a choice. I qualify this because I myself know there to be extremely difficult and impossible situations where to speak of Happiness is a kind of mockery and absurdity. Importance is given to religious faith in general as a means of getting through hard times, and sustaining one's trust in the world. Advice is given about the mistake of worrying overmuch, of causing ourselves to be stressed. One respondent gives a very interesting report in which he describes the way taking care of physical health has given greater happiness over all.<br />Again this is a book filled with interesting reports and helpful suggestions. Among others I find echoing my own experience are those which stress the importance of maintaining a certain lightness and humor , of trying to help and give to others, of loving family.<br />As I have indicated there are many whose situation is so bad that they cannot take any of the advice given here. But I believe those who can read this book will be able to learn from the experience of others the kind of wisdom , that will make their lives better.<br />A wonderful and useful book indeed.Advice is given about the mistake of worrying overmuch, of causing ourselves to be stressed.

B004ZQBOXC|5.0|We are getting ready to drive on vacation for 20 hours in a car. And seeing how well there songs sooth my son (2 years old) during his tantrums, knew I had to purchase this for our trip. (Seen there video's on TV). He loves to sing wiggle, wiggle, wiggle, wiggle yeah.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great app.  I can spend so much time playing. which can be a bad thing too :-)
B000XSWVEC|5.0|Purchase this movie for my wife. she was very excited, and can't wait to watch it over and over in the car during 20 hour drive. OH BOY.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I thought this game was adorable. Sure it has it's flaws, but this is a FREE game so I'm not complaining. I may not be, but the people who gave this one star need to get over it and get a life. Talk about mean.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|just got the dvd tonight. worth the money. i was a little freaked by the sound issue at first, since when i first played it all i got was the background soundtrack. you go to 'audio' and switch it to english, the spoken dialogue comes on and you have a great 50s style sci-i movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun and there are a lot of games to choose from. not just the same game over and over again.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My six year old used to play the free version and was continually clicking on the ads and then I would have to fix it and get him back on the right screen.  With the ad free version I never have to fix it for him.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Absolutely wonderful way of getting out the word of God. I use it as my daily reader and like the availability of changing screens and font sizes. The black background works best for me. The notes and sharing features are also wonderful. They are private or public you choose. The public way of sharing our walks is a testimony for those seeking Him. The new update now has links to passages and input on different verses. Keep up the mission God has placed upon your hearts Youversion.
0545123275|5.0|Okay, I know that this is silly, but my favorite thing about this book was the blue ink.  It was soothing and pleasing to look at.  The blue text also set the mood for the book, it was absolutely perfect because it had made me feel chilly. To get a feeling of what the text looks like just imagine the darker blue shades on the cover and that is the color the text is printed in. I don't know how many versions have the blue ink, I read a review that said they had gotten a book that had the regular black ink.  Linger (the next book) was printed in green and was also soothing but felt warm instead of cool; Forever (the last book) was printed in red and I thought that color was just irritating.<br /><br />Shiver seemed like a perfect title for this book.  The werewolves shift from human form to wolf form when the seasons change and when it gets colder, the book had some great descriptions of the frigid temperatures, it made me just want to crawl under a blanket.<br /><br />This was a wonderful YA novel, but, now I am going to sound like my 30 something self, did we have to have the implied sex. I know it was only once, but I think the book would have been fine without it. It seemed like such a pure and innocent book, I liked the fact that they slept in the same bed but didn't have relations for most of the story.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. it has completely changed my devotion time. being an oral learner, it helps me to listen to the audio as I read along. best app I have on my kindle.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app..... love the selection of reading plans, options for different versions, note section, and the audio option. This is the best Bible app its easy to use &amp; its comprehensive. I only wish it was accessible offline on my Kindle Fire.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app does exactly what it said it would. I play this everyday. I love the hints. Smooth game play and a minimum amount of advertising.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite solitaire app.  I really like the auto finish and card click features.  They help keep your hands from getting so fatiqued from repetitive movement.
B001R6AXYE|4.0|This is in regards to the limited edition clear vinyl NEMS re-pressing of Paranoid from a few years back. It's far from perfect, as the output volume is rather quiet compared to a 70's pressing, it's pressed very slightly off-center, you can hear faint ground hum between tracks, signal-to-noise is generally a bit too high and there are enough frequent pops and clicks that a new LP shouldn't exhibit.  Despite all of this, the dynamics, detail and sound-stage separation are all good, and it didn't just sound like a digital recording pressed to vinyl. Turn it up and it rocks, plain and simple. You won't miss a thing. Not bad NEMS, but it could have been better for this price.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play, good graphics, easy to read, beats sitting in waiting areas and being bored, addictive in a good way
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it has everything you need to get a relationship with God. the only thing missing is the church. I have tried other but this is the best.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are like the best games ever.  There is a game for parcatly everyone in this app... just give it a try...
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is nice cause of its news updates. as a youth of America I refuse to get my news from the paper, and Tv news is repetative and dark. the updates are rather swell as well.
1572522089|5.0|I gave this tape to my husband who is from japan and he really enjoyed it and has kept it for fitire enjoyment
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Did you ever think you could equate sitting on the bowl with a movie? Hollywood does, and it has a pile of crap for you. It will shovel it out to you in concentrated measures. Aliens and Cowboys? Yeah, it could have worked, if you had an actual story... or convincing actors.  Okay, I'll give a quick rip on the plot and then get back into gear tearing this thing apart. A cattle rancher haggardly played by a strained Harrison Ford bumps heads with a \\"cowboy\\" (a stupefied Daniel Craig)who looks like someone (a very original mean outlaw) but doesn't know who he is. Aliens ( seemingly devised by a ten year old child's mind)show up for no reason but to hoard of all things, gold.  Yes, gold is important in the old west of course, so now  we have a \\"plot\\". A wacked-out space girl is thrown in for good measure. She knows who's who and what's what, although her body wasn't sure if it could come back from something. These wooden characters are the best you'll ever see as they read their clunky lines with script in pocket. Oh and the action! These cowboys and stilted Indians fight aliens with the skill of a teen video gamer. But does it drag? The viewer can stare at a ranchers knife, rope, spoon, and know for sure this will prove the western genre exists in front of us. I don't think I've ever seen (in the modern era) material so empty and contrived than this gargantuan mess.  It's hard to comprehend that somebody actually made the statement, \\"yes, release this into a theatre.\\"
6303073107|5.0|The tape arrived on time and in good shape  My husband who is japanese really enjoyed the tape and saw it through to the end that same day
1451648537|5.0|Everything I expected. Well written and very interesting. I'm glad I bought this book. Highly recommend. This last line is just to meet the rediculous word count requirement. What a time waster!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i actually like that you have to unlock most of the games, gives me more incentive to play. i just wish you were awarded more coins so it doesn't take so long to unlock them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so cool. it has so many different addicting games. my personal favorite is the sushi game on there
B005OCFHHK|5.0|The package arrived at my door on the date estimated for arrival. It was unopened and when i reviewed all the discs on the blu ray player they all worked amazing! Wonderful buy and wonderful seller!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Like others, I found the ten email viewing limit on the fire using this app aggravating, but I did find a work around. If you turn your kindle fire for a landscape view, the app will then load more emails as you scroll down. But today I uninstalled the app and will probably not reinstall it because, as happened to another reviewer, the notification system went haywire and chimed the same new email over and over. The only way to make it stop was to uninstall it. Serious bug.  Also annoying was that this app would chime even when the fire was in silent mode. Yahoo needs to get the bugs out of this app before anyone would be able to enjoy using it.
0143119680|4.0|A Discovery of Witches is a vampire romance. Let me say that again. A Discovery of Witches is a Vampire Romance.<br /><br />Oh sure the title mentions `witches' instead of `vampires' or other vampire clich&eacute;s like blood, darkness, or night. It has witchy symbols on the cover and the synopsis calls it \\"equal parts history and magic, romance and suspense\\". But don't be deceived, this is a vampire romance.<br /><br />If you don't like vampire romances, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />You say you like vampire romances? So do I! But I've got a little more news for you before you decide to read this book.<br /><br />There's no boinking in A Discovery of Witches. There is kissing and...enough other stuff to freaking make a reader hopeful. But no boinkage. A Discovery of Witches is a boinkless non-YA vampire romance, which is as rare a creature as the ancient texts Diana studies.<br /><br />If you need your vampy heroes to get lucky, then this book is not for you.<br /><br />Still around? Really? Alrighty then, brass tacks.<br /><br />To my boinkage-loving surprise, I actually enjoyed this book a bunch. I found myself staying up late and jonesing for the 30 minutes of reading time I get during lunch. It is that absorbing.<br /><br />The first half is an interesting mixture of vampire romance and Dan Brown-ish academic-searches-for-ancient-treasure-despite-opposition-from-secret-society mystery. I loved the Oxford setting and supernatural creatures. Characters are thoroughly fleshed out with several backstories. This adds to the page count, but since the backstories are delightful little historical vignettes I enjoyed them nonetheless.<br />But it's the second half of the book that really drew me in, as it is mostly devoted to the romance. If you're an emotion junkie like me you'll have trouble putting the book down after you hit that halfway mark.<br />However, (here is why I believe this book gets so many 1 and 2 star ratings) our Oxford and Yale educated PhD heroine loses IQ points as she falls in love. We're told constantly how smart, brave, and intimidating she is, but those traits are inadequately demonstrated. It leads to this crap:<br /><br />\\"Even putting cups on a tray, you look formidable.\\" (barf)<br /><br />The Bishop house saved this book in my eyes. Just as Diana was becoming too much of a ditsy damsel in distress, she arrives at the Bishop house and falls into her element. This is where she worms her way back in to my good graces. All hail the Bishop house! It's my favorite character, and the most fabulous part of the book. I hear there's a movie in works, and I will watch it solely to see how they portray the Bishop house.<br /><br />Despite Diana's annoying degradation of IQ, reading A Discovery of Witches is an enjoyable experience. I'm looking forward to Book 2 (more Bishop house, please!). 4 stars.<br /><br />(I sooo wish I had a way to track how many people stopped reading after \\"no boinking\\"!)ntimidating she is, but those traits are inadequately demonstrated.

1595141715|1.0|This book had a wonderful premise. A young man receives audio tapes from a girl he had a crush on but who killed herself. I was looking forward to reading it. Was I wrong? The book was hard to read with the normal print (Clay's thoughts) and the italics (Hannah's thoughts). It was one of those books that I had to force myself to finish in order to find out what happens. Do not waste your time or money.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Yes, this is the most pretentious film I've seen in a long time. It tries to do a lot of things. And succeeds with a majority of it. It is beautiful, thoughtful, nostalgic and real. I cannot say I recommend it without knowing your taste in movies but I loved it myself. I am so happy that a few people are still trying to make films that are meaningful and unique.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|just got this so far it is pretty good something to take up spare time will post again when I have played it a little more
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love how realistic the physics of the game seem. It's a very original idea and they keep adding more levels.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire during my lunch break or times when I'm waiting for an appointment, or what not. Great time filler.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  The characters and story are well defined, the action and surprises are riveting, and it's just hard to put down.  Perfect for the Kindle.
1451648537|2.0|I was surprised that the delivery was quick. However, there was a scratch on the cover. This is my first book in English so I was disappointed with  this.
B000FSME1A|5.0|The original is one of the best movies about the Vietnam war. It captures bits and pieces of what it was like being in country. Redux on the other hand.... stinks, there is a reason the editor cut those sections out, all they add is time and boredom.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun and relaxing game. The music has a zen-like quality that is very non intrusive and adds to the experience.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I purchased for my granddaughter who is a cross country runner in high school.  She loves it.  She says it is helping in many ways to improve her program.  Being able to record the pace and distances on her computer is an excellent tool for helping her improve.
3836531038|4.0|Interesting concept, self portraiture... with some striking women. Bed and bathroom scenes a bit redundant but always a pretty face to distract you.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|I just added this to my Christmas playlist!! Great covers of new and old Xmas songs....and so relevant to the movie plotline. This was a great buy!!
B006GG1KOC|2.0|Just tested this out with my 3.5 year old. Sorry to say that it just isn't up to par. I worked together with him through the first few levels so he could figure out what the point of the game was. After a few levels he would just click on each picture individually without much thought to the purpose. The game looks good but is not quite right for his age group. Simplify it and add voice to it and it could be very good. If you asked the player to find the object that wasn't round, etc. it would be great for this age group. I'm sorry but most 3 year olds don't recognize a computer mouse or briefcase. Not sure what age group the dev was targeting with this app. Good concept for a 3 year old, but the content is more appropriate for a 4-6 year old. They would likely grow bored rather quickly, however.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I read this book in one straight sitting...I couldn't put it down!  From the very beginning, I grasped onto the characters and held on throughout the entire book.  Loved it!
030726999X|5.0|Just how long can an author keep you on the edge of your seat holding your breath, anyway?  In Stieg Larsson's case, certainly for over 500 pages worth of reading!<br /><br />As the 3rd and final book of the series, Hornet's Nest did not disappoint.  It was an exciting volley between opposing forces with intense drama to see which side would emerge victorious, and how it would all unfold.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander is an awesome character.  She is not warm and fuzzy and likeable, and yet you cannot help but be on her side.  The other characters are equally complex and interesting.<br /><br />This was the best series that I have read in years.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|This movie was by far the best and most worthwhile film in the entire \\"Planet of the Apes\\" series!  I absolutely loved it!  Caesar is played by the same actor who played Gholam in the 'Lord of the Rings' films and he is awe inspiring in this film.   This movie was well written and well acted. I loved it because the primates were computer generated and it was completely believable. THANK YOU FOR NOT USING REAL ANIMALS!!!!!!    This movie also had great respect for animals - primates in particular - and showcased the horrendous things humans do to them, such as animal testing. I was so engrossed in this movie and found myself shouting out loud and screaming into my pillow. Very well done.   Bravo!  Caesar is one of my ultimate heroes!!!!!!!!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This novel is absolutely beautiful. It has everything in it, romance, drama, tears, laughter. It's the perfect book for a quiet night in. I've read it 3 times now and everytime I read it, I still react the same each time. 10/10!
031603441X|5.0|I first heard of the book in a random Rolling Stone magazine I picked up. It had excerpts of \\"Life\\" in it and I ran right out to go buy the book right then and there. No page is uninteresting. Every story is intriguing and you will marvel at Keith Richards' life from cover to cover.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|This movie was just plain bad for lack of a more colorful word and it missed the mark utterly and pathetically on all accounts and then some. Thor is absolute, computer generated, cgi-visual eye candy garbage of the premium kind. I had to finish it in three sittings because I couldnt get through it in one. The plot is unbelievable (even for a fantasy super hero movie), the acting lousy, and I mean LOUSY, even by Portman, and Chris Hemsworth seems to have OD'ed on the steroids or something as apparently all that brain mass seems to have wandered into his muscles the size of tree trunks, leaving him a vacuuous moron who is the intellectual equivalent of a Disney cruise.   Everything in this movie is so painfully right on formula it makes you wanna puke. I could imagine the briefing the director and writers must have had with the studio execs who were rubbing their hands with greed, ordering them to seek out high profile stars (Portman, Hopkins) and some patny creamer of the season so as to put together an ensemble for a movie they can then boost up with immense cgi shots to generate huge profits at the box office. This movie was created by the marketing department. Ok the acting wasnt just bad, it was embarrassing for everyone involved. Portman and Hopkins must either really be hurting for money or just like the producers must have found a very easy way to secure astronomic salaries doing substandard projects. I guess a 50 million dollars a year income is just not enough for Portman.   The story itself is so dumb and cheeky and uninspiring, not to mention comatosely boring. No twists, no surprises, no intelligent conversations or thoughts - just trite cliches and banalities delivered right on time with lousy acting and predictable all the way. The \\"love story\\" was dumb and totally unbelievable as well. I dont see how these people could fall in love. They never exchange one intelligent sentence. Their \\"conversations\\" consist of Thor grunting a line, flexing his musclesor reciting some dumb poetic line shoved into his face by the writers, and which I doubt Hemsworth even understands, and Portman looking all dreamy and concerned. This was like watching a bad Michael Bay rip off. I genuinely fail to understand all the good reviews as objectively really this was a bad movie in every way possible. The only reason I can recommend to anyone to waste their time on this piece of junk is to see for themselves just how truly bad it is. I thought I had seen my share of lousy movies but this one tops the list. If i could give it zero stars I would  - but even that would be too generous.

B006GG1KOC|5.0|This is a great app for kids. I played it to the end myself and it deliveres on what they advertise, the animation is really nice and the levels are challenging as you get higher (again, this is for kids). I played on a Samsung Infuse without issue. Worth the 99&cent;, even better that it's free today.

B0063IH60K|4.0|Quick and easy to play on my Kindle Fire. Card movement is smooth. I like the option to play a winnable game. I don't always win the first time through, but it's nice to know that it's possible.
1416550534|2.0|I picked this book because I loved Kate Morton's \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  Unfortunately reading \\"The House at Riverton\\" was like watching paint dry.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Ad heavy and the games are mediocre.  Game play is not the most intuitive.  The response is poor with too many middies.  I've removed it from my kindle.  It is free.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is quite possibly the most gripping story that I have ever read. It moved me to the point of tears, which no book has done to this effect, ever before. Not Catcher In the Rye, not Great Gatsby, not A Clockwork Orange, not even The Outsiders. I think that this book is not only superior to some of these books, but it deserves a place among them.
0525478817|5.0|A truly great book has balance. The Fault in Our Stars is one of the few books that achieve this. The balance between comedy and tragedy is absolutely magical.   The main characters' obsession with the fictional novel An Imperial Affliction may for a moment appear to be pretentious and off-putting, but I can't remember reading a novel in the past few years in which the characters were as real and inspired. John Green succeeds in the challenge of having unique characters without alienating the reader. I believe this book to be John Green's best so far.   Warning: you won't laugh in the same way as you did with John Green's other novels, such as Paper Towns and Looking for Alaska - but you will feel more feelings than you ever thought a book could inspire in a reader. John Green not only imagines his characters complexly, but also imagines the reader to be complex as well.

B002N8A14M|5.0|This armband is GREAT!  It keeps my iPod from getting banged up at the gym but still allows me easy access to the click-wheel (a SERIOUS problem I had with a previous armband).  No issues with headphone jack not making good contact with the iPod and nice that the cable connects easily so I don't have to take it out of the case to charge or sync.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I loved this season!  I watched it all in about 2 nights, I couldnt stop watching it and stayed up until almost 2 a.m. each night watching it.  It's a great series!
B003Y5HWK4|4.0|Hugo seemed like such a departure for director Martin Scorsese; a man who usually delivers very adult and captivating crime films that usually revolve around gangsters and are nothing less than extraordinary. A family film featuring none of a director's known genre trademarks and relies on nothing more than his visionary and artistic style just feels so rare these days. Not many directors are willing to take that sort of risk, especially at this point in their career. That's where \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" comes in. \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" feels exactly like what you'd expect and love from Scorsese and was more than likely the happy middle ground while he was working on Hugo. Even though Hugo didn't make its way into theaters until 2011 and \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" debuted on HBO in 2010, Scorsese probably had some overlapping duties on both projects somewhere in there. But enough about Hugo, \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" is very much its own beast and it wastes little time ripping into your core right from the start.<br /><br />\\"Boardwalk Empire\\" uses every inch of its HBO television format; every curse word under the sun is used frequently with a very particular fondness for the F-word in general, women seem to be itching at the chance to take their clothes off (and more than likely are since a good portion of the first season takes place in a brothel in Chicago) as both full frontal nudity for both sexes is included along with fairly explicit sex scenes, and then there's the exceptional amount of violence in the show you've become familiar with when stories are told about gangsters. Guys getting whacked, headshots, beat downs, choke-outs, hangings, and robberies that go south only begin to skim the top of what to expect from the show. None of this should be considered a bad thing either as all of these ingredients along with the storyline, the cast, and the exceptional set pieces only help contribute to the powerhouse the show has become.<br /><br />Take Shelter was one of the films that made it on to many \\"top 10 best films\\" of last year and it's fascinating that two thirds of its main cast are supporting characters on this show. Shea Whigham plays Eli Thompson, the brother of Steve Buscemi's Nucky Thompson. Despite being brothers, the underlying tension between the two is what you'll take away most from their relationship as Eli seems to not only envy his brother's treasurer position but feels like he could do what his brother does even better. Michael Shannon is Agent Nelson Van Alden; a strict prohibition agent that puts his job before anything else. Van Alden is a very religious man, but the way he honors The Lord becomes very peculiar as his personal demons come to light as the season progresses. Steve Buscemi is excellent as Nucky Thompson, but Michael Pitt really comes into his own as Jimmy Darmody. The way Jimmy evolves, his past with the war, and the struggle to keep his family together causes Jimmy to be the most standout character of the entire cast. Stephen Graham, Michael Stuhlbarg, Kelly Macdonald, and Vincent Piazza aren't to be overlooked either. The ensemble cast is just really spectacular all around.<br /><br />What makes \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" work as well as it does is the way it seems to capture the atmosphere of 1920. The set pieces are extraordinary, especially on the boardwalk. The classic cars and the custom made suits for the men and the extravagant dresses for the women all seem to be pulled straight from that particular time period and placed on this boardwalk of a rebuilt Atlantic City from over ninety years ago. Then there's the way that nearly everyone smoked back then and that is more than relevant here. If somebody isn't drinking, then they're more than likely smoking and there's rarely a scene without one of the two occurring. The music may be the coup de grace though that really seals the essence of the early 20's. They really did an exceptional job making you feel like you've traveled back to this time period.<br /><br/>\\"Boardwalk Empire\\" seems to have all of the appropriate seeds planted to achieve greatness. You get a front row seat to see how gangsters and politicians do business, you have a fascinating storyline with a rogue's gallery full of interesting characters all featuring their own quirks and traits to allow you to fall in love with or come to hate each and every one of them, and the show really makes you feel like you're walking on the boardwalk of Atlantic City in 1920. It is on the cusp of really fantastic things. With that said, I don't think season one really gets to those things just yet. There are teases that feature some really incredible scenes (Jimmy's boardwalk beat down of the photographer is a favorite of mine), but the first season feels like just that; an introduction. Hopefully the seasons to come can capitalize on this and \\"Boardwalk Empire\\" can evolve into one of the greatest shows to ever be produced.<br /><br />The Blu-ray set is pretty loaded with special features. Each disc features an Enhanced Viewing Mode for all twelve episodes. This mode goes behind the scenes while discussing the production, history locations, the music, and cast interviews among many other things. The main issue I had was that every time I tried to watch the Enhanced Viewing Mode on any episode my Blu-ray player would reboot. I made sure it was up to date, but it still had this problem. I also had this problem whenever I went to \\"Episodes\\" on any of the main menu on the discs. I had to \\"Play All\\" and skip through the episodes I'd already seen if I only watched one episode at a time and returned to it later. So I'm not entirely sure if that's because there was a problem with the set or my player, but considering the player is only a few months old I'm thinking it's the former.<br /><br />Other special features include a Character Dossier which features profiles of every character and full length bios, six audio commentaries with Terence Winter, Steve Buscemi, Michael Kenneth Williams, Michael Shannon, and more, Speakeasy Tour which is a twenty four minute tour of some of the famed Prohibition speakeasies in Chicago and New York with cast from the show, Atlantic City: The Original Sin City is a nearly thirty minute documentary on the history of Atlantic City during the 1920s, a nineteen minute Making Boardwalk Empire featurette is mostly just an intro to the characters but also goes into detail about the show's conception and how Martin Scorsese became involved, and my personal favorite Creating the Boardwalk.

B006GG1KOC|4.0|Seriously folks...its a game that teaches diifferences to young children. Its not meant to be challenging or difficult, its meant to instill confidence and understanding in young children who are still trying to understand the true meaning of differences.  Also...I havent seen pictures in the below example yet, so I'll say that the difference between a watermelon, carrot, cake, and lollipop is one of two things:  1) The carrot is straight, whereas the others are round or 2) The carrot is not sweet, the others are.  Go back to elementary school, kiddies...you're kids are getting it, so why can't you?
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is the best case out there for a fire. It is slim, matte finished, and just beautiful. I had tried a case I bought off ebay and it was cheap leather and bulky. Then I bought this one and ditched the other case I bought. I would reccommend this case for anyone that loves their fire and wants to protect it!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|we need more kid apps as FAOTD. maybe then the trolls would leave. that's my thought about this. amazon needs to fix this rating system
B0030BOCKK|3.0|Im not a fan of him. I just likes a little bit Razorblada Romance + Love Metal. I didnt likes the other albums and i find this album hust ok (which means that is far bette rthen their previous album). They dont have so many hits (actually they have only one track - the first), but they play better music than the classic poser Him style.
0439023513|5.0|******SPOILER ALERT******    The Mockingay was a very intense fast-paced book! There were a few things that didn't make sense to me, that I would have done differently but I do think the ending is VERY realistic.  It was a HUGE shock to me when President Coin wanted to hold another Hunger Game for the higher up Capitol children.  I was surprised, not because I didn't think Coin wouldn't do something like that, it's just the thought anyone would think that was a good idea was so shocking.  I did see a lot of reviews by people who didn't like the ending because it was too sad for them but this isn't some fairytale book, it's supposed to be a realistic book about war and the lasting results from experiencing such terrible things! So yes, the ending isn't a fairytale ending, but we're left with a feeling of hope for the future. I am a 14 year old girl, and I really enjoyed this series and would recommend it to my friends.  I would not recommend for anyone younger than 10-12.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|It's a cute game for young children. I agree with others that it would be more educational to show what the similarities are. Otherwise they just have to keep clicking until the right answer is chosen.
B006VA3ZT6|5.0|Can you spell: M-A-R-V-E-L-O-U-S ?  What a treasure this Downton Abbey has been...and NO ANNOYING COMMERCIALS...YIPPEE!  PBS can really do justice to period pieces of acting and the myriad of story lines all happening and intertwining is wonderful. Their are people you 'love' and people you 'hate'...so you are cheering and jeering all within sections of 10 or 15 minutes.   LOVE Bates & Anna, Mrs. Hughes...Carson is endearing...Lady Mary makes my mad, disappointed, or sad from one moment to the next. Lady Grantham drives me nuts with her naive belief of her personal maid O'Brien. Thomas is just plain evil...and this new fiancee Lavinia (of Matthew Crawley's) is up to some disastrous plot with Sir Richard...hope Lady Rosamund sniffs it out in time to save Matthew from marrying the little twit...or before Lady Mary succumbs to Sir Richard.   The only player that the  writers cannot seem to make up their mind about is Lady Edith...one minute she is charming, then writing letters to destroy her sister but would really ruin the entire family name so she is quite stupid to not forsee, then she learns to drive but can't keep her hands off a married man? Hopefully they will bring out some good qualities soon, or she will be stuck in the pea-green with envy of sister Mary mode.  I have viewed the season one streaming via Netflix, and am disappointed Amazon charges to view each episode even with a Prime Membership. Also PBS site has Season One and Season Two on DVD available for combined purchase for less than thirty five dollars as of Feb. 7, 2012 (pre-order--before season is even seen on TV), really would like to see Amazon offer for at least the same amount with free shipping!

0802473156|5.0|When my young granddaughter got engaged I wanted to give her something special. After researching this book, decided on this. She and her fiance were going to their minister for council and I was so pleased when she told me that the first  thing he told them was to get this book and read it together.  Have given it since then to other young couples, would highly recommend as an engagement gift or for a couple going through a difficult time in their marriage.
B004HO6I2O|2.0|I bought this as a surprise for my wife, who was an extra in the movie (she wound up on the cutting room floor).  Basically, its crude with a fair amount of nudity.  It has a couple of really funny lines, but mostly it's just sophmoric humor that's not that funny.
1451648537|5.0|Excellents book (Steve Jobs --- You must read this authorised biography that offers a lot of insight into the driving force behind Apple and everything that you would like to know about him :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I could barely put this book down.  I read it over two days between work and late into the night.  It breaks the silence about what really went on with the troops on the ground in Iraq and gives a first person account of the action, screw ups (mostly by the higher ups in command), bravery and the hell our troops went through in that war.  A unique point of view comes from Chris's wife Tanya with her comments on their family life throughout the book.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the war in Iraq, SEALs, UTDs and the hardships the troops and families have to endure.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is a magnificent reboot of a much beloved franchise. This film is in a sense a remake or rather reimagining of the 4th film in the original series \\"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\\"   Our Hero Ceaser is the main character Rise follows the same story structure as the original Conquest. In rise apes are being used as experimental guinea pigs for a alz medication tio cure the sickness .In the process of finsing a cure humans inadvertantly create an intelligent ape ( Ceaser ) Ceaser being angered by the way the humans mistreat the apes set off a revolution. A highly intelligent written story with a great deal of chrachter development for the apes which make us so empathetic to the plight of the apes we find ourselves rooting for the apes.  A must see for anyone who is a fan of the original and if your not a fan of the original please do see it you will not be dissapointed. Forget the Tim Burton version this has no connection to that film at all   One thing I enjoyed in this film was the refferance to the first manned mission to Mars the 'Icarius' and the fact that earth at some point losses contact with this ship, a small plot point but hopefully paving the way for the next film, you decide and enjoy the apes !!
B005LAIGN2|4.0|I was so excited to see the movie, that I posted ahead of time. Now that I've seen it, I thought it was a great telling of a true story. I give it a solid 4 stars, because the actors were excellent, the cinematography was good, the combat effects were actually better than okay. The music could have been better, but despite that it is an instant classic in my book.  The movie is fantastic because it shows the story of men who had to fight with honor and dignity against extreme odds in order to fight with bullets and power against our country's enemies. Their story has been represented before on film, and hopefully will again; it's a story worthy of being told over and over. Thumbs up to the actors, producers and all involved for doing a very good job. Was it the best of the best job possible? Maybe not, but it was entertaining and enlightening. I respect George Lucas for caring enough to put his money into this story, to bring it to the big screen like a major film, despite the reluctance of many other parties in the film industry. Could some other director/producer combination have made a technically more outstanding movie? Maybe, but they evidently don't care enough about the true story to do it. Kudos to all involved!  The events portrayed a version of history that was very engaging, and in a way that was also realistic. The heroes weren't shown to be perfect, with the flight leader having a drinking problem, for example, which seemed to cause problems, and one of the other pilots being a real hotshot. Overall, I gained a lot of insight into the difficulties that the \\"colored\\" pilots encountered but at no point did I feel like I was being \\"taught\\" a history lesson.  It seems like they didn't add a lot of extra drama to the story, which I almost wish they would have, altho the history as is has plenty of drama and heroism. The drama developed on several levels; first, the reluctance to put \\"colored\\" pilots on the front had to be overcome. Then, each mission had dramatic action, with all of the pilots and ground crew adding his sparky personality to the dramatic tone. I felt rise and fall and release of each dramatic thread.  I was already aware of the Tuskegee Airmen, and was excited to see what a George Lucas production would do with the story. Overall, I was satisfied, altho it didn't have the melodrama of a Star Wars episode, and I was looking for him to go overboard a bit, maybe just with the music. Those airmen were heroes and they really deserve to have a first class feature document the important, if not vital, contribution they made to the war effort. Now I know some of their names and I fell in love with them as patriots and gentlemen.  I saw Lucas on Jon Stewart's Daily Show, and he talked about how difficult it was to get this film distributed, because the big film distributors feared the audience would not be there for a film with a mostly-black cast. I hope their fears are wrong and this film is welcomed globally for it's production values, it's entertainment qualities, and it's documentation of a historical reality. I loved it, it's an instant classic in my book on many levels and am so happy to see this story make it to the big screen this way.  The audience showed up in droves, with the house being overflowing Friday night. The audience got engaged with the story, applauding at the end. I know a lot of us were happy to see the film and enjoyed seeing these heroes brought to life on the big screen.  Previous entry:  Feature film executive produced by George Lucas, who felt compelled to bring the inspiring legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, the first African American pilots and crew, to the big screen. He called it the first all-black action film of modern times. We can expect to see an exciting true story told of the heroism of the people who rose above, aimed high, believed in themselves and used their brain, in service to our country at a time when their effort is credited with turning the tide of the war.  The \\"Red Tail Angels\\" were skilled pilots and fierce fights, often requested by bomber pilots, who wanted their escort to base. The Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 1500 missions between June 1943 and April 1945, many of which were as bomber escorts.  Unlike our beloved hero Luke Skywalker, who George Lucas made unforgettable, he is now bringing to our imaginations the real-life adventures of men who helped win the real historical fight against tyranny and hate. Let's get out there on January 20th and make it a blockbuster weekend!!!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This was a great movie! It had that guy from fight club in it, not Edward Norton, but the other one, the one that was Edward Norton but not really, just like a pretend Edward Norton.  I'm drawing a blank on his name, I think it started with a \\"P\\", maybe a \\"B\\"...the white guy, maybe it was Philip.  Yea, that was it Philip...ugh I can't remember his last name...Von Wolfhaussen.  Yea, Philip Von Wolfhaussen.  Anyway Philip was great in this movie.  I think he played a Pirate who fought a ninja named Jonah Hill.

B000055Y0X|5.0|[[ASIN:B00000J2L8 Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]] I purchased this DVD for a shut-in friend who had never seen the movie but was curious about references I made to the movie from time to time.  It's a classic film, of course, of the end of the world brought on by cold war politics and nuclear weapons.    The classic scenes of this movie are too many to recount, but one of my favorites is of the character, Dr. Strangelove, being able to finally get up from his wheelchair, salute his new Fuhrer, the president of the United States, screaming \\"I can valk, my Fuhrer!\\" as he contemplated having ten nubile young women assigned to him as the upper political and military establishment planned to live in a deep coal mine to survive the nuclear holocaust and nuclear winter. The black humor back in the early 1960's was especially dark as many of us went through the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, a heart-stopping case of Life imitating Art.      A new audience of younger viewers with no direct knowledge of the Cold War and the MAD strategy [Mutual Assured Destruction] may still enjoy this movie as we all contemplate a slower moving, all encompassing doomsday machine called Global Warming and Climate Change. This Doomsday Machine is not fiction and is a global phenomenon which will affect us all.  Perhaps a new generation of movie makers can satirize our present predicament as Stanley Kubrick did with the Cold War, and make us all fully aware of the dangers that lie ahead for the planet.

This just testifies to his reality since most of the world just loves to mock the savior.  enjoy.  My niece told me that Jim Parsons reminds her of me, what a compliment.  Also a side note: Laurie Metcalf looks absolutely amazing and Kaley Cuoco, very, very beautiful. Actually this show is brilliant.  All the women are absolutely perfect in their roles.  The men are as well.  Elmer fudd needs to go, its too obvious.  The script and actors are a perfect recipe for a delightful time.  I watched all four seasons in 2 days, currently on round 2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game all the time.  I have gotten so far into it. I love so much. It is a great game.

0439023521|4.0|Suzanne Collins  has crafted a quite enthralling story in the opening book of her Hunger games series. As an adult it seemed to be quite an easy read that was not bogged down with too much of the Who am I? What will I be? Questions coming in young adult literature. The main character Katniss is commendable in her struggles through the novel and is a strong female character that can be easily aspired to. The story was fast paced and should be able to kept the attention span of even the most difficult of readers. The love entanglement of the story is low and realistic with very little in the sense of romantic encounters.(The furthest the story goes is kissing and a boy and girl sleeping together for warmth.)   That said there is a little something missing from the story that would have lead this novel to enter into the realm of perfect reading. Katniss seems just a little too much like an empty shell and not perfectly rounded out. There are also a lot of questions that are unanswered towards the end of the book that may be a spur point to get kids to read the next in the set but as a one book review those unanswered questions leave a little hole.   The book is excellent for a quick read and any child from 10-16 should be able to enjoy it fully. The character is not weak like the Bella Swan type and strives to survive despite the challenges set in front of her. The Hunger Games works in a clean set of morals that seem character specific and does not over sexuality the situation that combined with the fast paced story that is difficult to put down and I have recommended it to my child in hopes that she will want to pick up more dystopia's.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|this game was great. both me and my children enjoy playing it. some of the sets are vague and confusing, but if you put your mind to it you can figure it out! and there is no penalty for making a wrong choice, so guess away. great learning game.
B003Y5H574|5.0|Steve Carell plays Cal Weaver, who has just discovered his wife Emily of twenty odd years (played by Julianne Moore) has been cheating on him with a smarmy co-worker played by Kevin Bacon.  The couple has two children living at home, sometimes minded by cute babysitter Jessica (played by Analeigh Tipton,) who has an unrequited crush on Cal. Cal and Emily's thirteen year-old son Robbie (Johan Bobo), in turn, has an unrequited crush on older woman (four years older, to be exact) Jessica.<br /><br />The most difficult circumstance of this breakup, at least from my point of view, is that fact that Cal and Emily have been together since the tender age of fifteen--making the now ousted Cal seem incredibly vulnerable and helpless now that he is out on his own for the first time in his life.  Without any experience in meeting women beyond having asked young Emily out for an ice cream cone twenty some years ago, poor Cal is completely adrift without a clue where to begin this new phase of his personal life.  An unlikely Good Samaritan comes to his aid, however, in the person of Ryan Gosling's Jacob, a lady's man who takes it upon himself to remake Cal in his own image.  With Jacob's help, Cal soon finds himself bedding one babe after another, including a woman (played by the always appealing Marisa Tomei) who he later (and embarrassingly) discovers to be his son's teacher!<br /><br />The various love polygons left in the wake of Cal's newfound persona and romantic conquests adds to the dilemma that he still loves his estranged wife and would dearly wish to return to his pre-breakup life--as evidenced by the secret nocturnal gardening that he indulges in around his old house.  Complications duly ensue that complicate this quest, leaving the viewer wondering, like Cal, how life's complex problems can ever be sorted out!

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The innocence of childhood lost to early combined with the harsh reality of friendship and love formed in life threating sitations come together to form this startling look at children forced to grow up too early and quickly.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I like this. Don't listen to some of those other reviews, yes a grown person should get thru this fast. It made for little KIDS.  It's good for the little ones. Will save for grandson.
B005TPCQ5I|4.0|I've wanted to see this movie for awhile and nearly rented it for $4.99 on Time Warner the other day. Thank goodness I waited. Amazon charged $.99. So, if you are on the fence - let the price sway you and then be greatful that you made the right choice.  I tend to like movies such as these. Not slow, but methodical in its pace. I thought both characters played their parts well. I will be making this part of my collection. I also plan on purchasing the book, via Kindle, once I submit this.
B006B9TLT0|5.0|This album is great for collectors. It differs from the original live album with three extra songs on the DVD and a documentary for the making of the Mean music video (also featured in Behind the Video on CMT). Just be aware this is a Target exclusive CD, which I failed to figure out before I bought it from Amazon. It's only $20 at Target stores right now. When it's out of production at Target, then it may be worth this much, but right now, just scoot on over to Target and get it.
B001GQSY5K|1.0|According to my son, THE WALKING, TALKING STAR WARS ENCYCLOPEDIA, our DVD is missing a scene. He has viewed others' DVDs and seen the scene in question.<br />Missing scene:<br />Anakin, Ahsoka, Ventress fall into the rancor pit.  The scene is a few minutes long.

B005HSG3VK|4.0|The cover is well made with quality materials.  It has received extensive use over several weeks without any problems.  I felt the price was high considering it's only a cover, but other suppliers were similar in price.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Very nice remote desktop app. Has a lot of pros and very few cons. I like the fact that the pc sound comes through the phone speakers. Nice touch. Seems to connect better to my pcs better than Teamviewer (the rdc app I was using previous to this one). And unlike Teamviewer, you don't have to disable your desktop's wallpaper for a better connection. It connects just fine with it enabled. I also like some of the other options, like the scroll wheel you can enable on the side of the screen. Makes scrolling through webpages and large folders very easy. I got this as the free app of the day a few days ago, but this app is well worth paying for.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Just works.  I think that is the best compliment I can give an app.  It was nice that it was included with the Fire.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Love this movie it is one of the best I would highly recommend it to any one who likes Clint
B000002L99|5.0|This is Ed's masters thesis. Each song packs more musical flavor than a past Van Halen album combined. (You won't find three-chord simplicity here. No Jump, no You Really Got me.) It is about \\"acceptable/perceptible complexity.\\" From Good Enough to Summer Nights, bars and bars of musical delight pours out of this disc. Why Can't This Be Love: a concentrated rock-funk-soul-pop gem. Get Up, the fastest, most inspiring rock'and'roll song ever written--works better than any power drink. Love Walks In, sweeps you off your feet and takes you on an intergalactic journey. The intro of the title song 5150 packs Eddie's guitar adventure into 12 bars of goosebump-inducing music. Then there is Dreams, woven with cerebral textures of piano and guitar arpeggios, with impossible singing, is Van Halen's symphony: 5150 is not a pop album, neither straightforward rock. Rather music from out of this world that confirms Eddie and Alex Van Halen's place as the greatest American composers of the 20th century. Eddie, Al: you gave us 5150. You don't have to prove anyone anything. But, just be respectful of your own legacy.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars is perfection. You could say it's *puts on sunglasses* faultless. AWWWW YEAHHH. Sorry I couldn't resist that pun. John Green writes engrossing and honest. He makes it feel as though there is no barrier between the story and the reader. And the story is hauntingly beautiful. The characters feel real. The pain and joy feels real. Its honestly the best book I've read ever.  You will lie on your bed after reading this and just think about the amazingness you were lucky enough to experience. You need to read this book. You will not be disappointed. I promise. I'll stop writing this review to go back and reread it.
B003L77TZI|4.0|This album is the most infectious thing I ever heard since Van Halen's 5150. Go Katy! (I can't believe I said that).

B003YLM780|5.0|This is one of my favorite holiday movies. It's great because you can watch it any time of the year as it celebrates all of the holidays.  If you are a White Christmas lover you will also enjoy this movie as the Inn used in Holiday Inn is also used in White Christmas, and the song White Christmas also appears in Holiday Inn.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't remember how I stumbled upon Beautiful Disaster but boy am I glad I did. It's the first non paranormal book that I've read and thoroughly enjoyed in a LONG while. Travis & Abby's love story had me on an emotional roller coaster. I was up until late reading it because I couldn't put it down. It's that GOOD and money well spent :)  I have bought Jamie's other books and am hoping I can pull myself away from BD to read them.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app is awesome on my kindle fire. the interface is welcoming and User friendly. It also gives me updates in the top left corner every time I unlock the screen.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This documentary not only shows the impact that the band had on one another, but also the impact they made on the music industry as well as those who enjoy listening to their music. I believe every emotion was experienced while viewing this magnificent piece of art! Excellent add to any music lovers collection!
B004K7HMJ6|2.0|Listen, I'm not gonna be a broken record here and restate what others have said. But honestly, aside from her strong vocal ability, this album plays like the trite, manufactured rubbish that it is. There were times when her self gratifying runs were like nails on a chalkboard to me. Couldn't hardly stand to listen to them. With the exception of a select few hits that I'm sure will be pumped as singles (Price Tag, Momma Knows Best, Nobody's Perfect) there is not much substance to this record.<br /><br />That being said, I'm not one to favor pop and tend to listen to indie. I'm not even sure how this album was put in my hands, but I sampled it none the less.  Don't get me wrong, Jessie J can sing, but in my opinion she's lacking soul. I mean, my office partner and I got a good laugh out of the ridiculous quotes listed upon the album sleeve that came with the cd (which I'm sure were meant to be deep and meaningful). We got a good laugh anyways.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Yes the cover is a must have to have. I has already saved the screen from damage. And will continue to do so.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to rapidly switch between versions, do lookups (by word or topically), follow reading plans, have it read to me, and more. Very cool.
1423113454|5.0|Wow! I would recommend this book to people of all ages.  Rick Riordan does it again with The Red Pyramid.  I've always been a fan of the 39 clues series and his Percy Jackson series, but this time he brings entertainment with Egyptian Mythology.  Rick Riordan does an amazing job of teaching you about mythology and providing an entertaining, intense book!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|I am in my late 50's and while I was watching the presentation, my very early 20s daughter-in informed me that she had also watched the documentary! This really impressed me! I have enjoyed most of Michael Moore's documentaries. This one is no exception. What I like most about Michael's documentaries is that he uncovers information on the topics which he chooses to focus that you just do not find anywhere but in his documentaries. His movies reach across the spectrum to all age categories. He digs in and gets out more information than main stream media ever can or will. I may not always agree with his conclusions about the subject that he chooses, but I can say unequivocally that, I will definitely learn more new information about that subject than I would have without his presentation. Michael has this unique ability to get into and uncover information that just would not otherwise be found. He is a master of uncovering hidden and buried information! In this documentary Michael shows the the real effects of crony-capitalism. He raises some really compelling moral questions, in my mind, about the implementation of crony-capitalism (fascism) and our current de facto governmental system. This is especially disturbing in the area of banks and their influence on our legal system. I don't know if this was his intention, but it really makes one think about our part in this very current drama, as he exposes these problems that have now become institutionalized in our society!
0525478817|5.0|I have just finished reading this novel.  To be honest, I went to Barnes and Noble and was just going to read it and wait for a pdf.  The only way I was going to buy it was if his signature was in the book, which it wasn't.  So I sat down and read.  I reached roughly page 205 and I had to put down the book.  I was going to start bawling my eyes in the middle of Barnes and Noble.  I got up, went to the register and bought it.  I read about 80 books a year, no joke, no lie.  Only one book has ever made me cry, and that was Tuesdays With Morrie by Mitch Albom.  I simply cried.  This novel made me sob.  It makes you question everything you ever believed.  It has changed my life and I can assume already the main characters would have found some flaw in the sentences I just typed and joined to make a joke out of my incorrect use of words and its structure as a whole. However, to be truly honest with you - if you don't read this book and buy it,  I feel very sorry for you.  This book deserves nothing but 5 stars.  Five stars.  John Green is a literary genius and he has evoked another beautiful and raw story that will leave you laughing out loud, crying, and dreading the end.  No other words can ever phrase how I feel right now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wonderful game! Enjoy playing!  I like winning! It is always a surprise when I win. It could take a few cards or it could take lots of card.

0060873027|3.0|Unfinished when Michael Crichton died in 2008, the task of wrapping up \\"Micro\\" fell to Richard Preston, who ran with typical Crichton formula and style to crank out an entertaining - if pedestrian - SciTech thriller that will keep the paging turning even as you cringe at a dopey plot and a hilariously evil villain.  Salvaging \\"Micro\\" is the science of the \\"micro-world\\" - that overlooked and underappreciated cosmos of insects and microorganisms that outweigh - and arguably will outlast - humankind on Earth.<br /><br />Start with a team of seven PhD-candidate graduate students in storied Cambridge, Mass; cloistered geniuses in arcane fields of ethnobiology, arachnology, pheromones, entomology, and more.  When a couple of venture capitalists pull up in Farrari's, the idealistic students can't wait to back their bags for for an all expenses-paid recruiting trip to Hawaii to visit the clandestine Nanigen MicroTechnologies, a startup with $1B in funding that reportedly has found a better way to unlock the medicinal secrets hidden in the Earth's vastly undiscovered flora and fauna riches.  One of the Nanigen recruiters is Eric Jansen, older brother of Peter Janson who is a specialist in the venoms of snakes and other creatures.  Eric returns to Hawaii with his insanely rich and ruthless CEO-boss, Vik Drake.  Before Peter's bags are packed, he receives a terse \\"Don't come\\" text from brother Eric, learning soon after that Eric, an experienced boater and swimmer, has disappeared in a dubious boat accident.  What follows is pure Crichton: a factoid infused adventure reminiscent of the offspring of Racquel Welsh's 1966 \\"Incredible Voyage\\" and the inevitable comparisons to a micro-sized \\"Jurassic Park.\\"  Others will find similarities to Crichton's \\"Prey\\" or \\"Fear Factor\\" - which is perhaps \\"Micro's\\" biggest weakness: it has that \\"been there, read that\\" feel.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean it's not a lot of fun; a white-knuckles comic book style romp through Hawaiian rain forests where ants are only slightly less fearsome than centipedes; a place where you'll develop much more respect for Mynah birds, parasite wasps, and bats.  While Crichton-style science is always a bit stretched and sensationalized, this will take you on an entertaining ride spiced with violence and appropriate grossness, a couple of mildly interesting surprises, but especially some fascinating insight into the miniature world that we so little appreciate.ly slightly less fearsome than centipedes; a place where you'll develop much more respect for Mynah birds, parasite wasps, and bats.

0525423656|5.0|Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars!<br /><br />I honestly can't believe how much I loved this book! I think I might be one of the few people who liked Crossed more than its predecessor, Matched.<br /><br />One of my favourite things about Crossed was that it was told through alternating first person narratives between Cassia and Ky, because I loved being able to see how they saw each other. Cassia and Ky were both such sweet, emotionally strong, and realistically flawed characters, and their romance made me ache in places that shouldn't be able to ache.<br /><br />Admittedly, Crossed was a little hard to get into at first because the pacing was slower. But once I did, I couldn't put it down! And not because it was a fast-paced adventure with lots of action, but because it was a gripping and surprising journey that had me rooting for the characters all the way through!<br /><br />There's something beautiful about the way Ally Condie writes. It's like poetry, but not! At first they just look like words, sometimes a little confusing, but when you understand them they move you. They have meaning. They make your heart ache and your mind float and I love it.<br /><br />Beautiful, heart-aching, and definitely inspirational, Crossed is a sequel I wholeheartedly recommend to everyone who enjoyed Matched! And don't get me wrong -- you'll love this book if you're Team Xander too! I can't wait until I can get my hands on the next installment!<br /><br />BUY or BORROW?: To be completely honest, I LOVE having this book on my shelf and I would love it if you guys bought it too! But I know that some people may not enjoy it as much as I did, so I would be totally content if you borrowed it as long as you pick it up somehow! :)

B005OCFHHK|1.0|I just received my set of blu-rays and the first movie is not even the correct title! It says \\"Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone\\" instead of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone\\" Needless to say I am going to try to return the set, however it is from an outside seller but fulfilled by Amazon...Mike Malin from Lexington , KY. I didn't realize this when I purchased the set and am very upset with this and not even sure if it can be returned. Wait for the official release set, this is a cheap knock-off!
1592400876|5.0|If you were one of the quirky folks who actually enjoyed diagramming sentences as a child (like me) or if you get irritated when you see apostrophe mistakes (like me), you will be crazy about this book. I was surprised to find myself discussing this book last night as each of us argued for our favorite mark of punctuation.<br /><br />If, on the other hand, you not only have no favorite mark of punctuation, but you aren't aware that marks of punctuation have names...well, perhaps you might seek another book.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|the best game my daughter has ever played, according to her anyway. it's the only game she plays on her kindle these days.

B005KAH7QU|5.0|The movie was over before I knew it.  Thats the sign of a great movie.  I was captivated from beginning to end.  If you like assassin movies, you'll like this one.  If you like spy movies, you'll like this one.  If you like cool movies that are immensely entertaining, then you'll like this one.
B006GG1KOC|3.0|Yes, I understand this is a kid game, and the kids I babysit would love this, some of the levels I couldn't&quot;t figure out how it was different. Other than that.. enjoyable.
0062012339|5.0|I read this book because I enjoy the author's other books and I was not let down. This book goes into great detail into the rise and fall of the band Motley Crue. It is really more than about the band, it's about four guys growing up and the typical highs and lows that everyone goes through, except these guys do it to the power of ten. Everything they did was larger than life--that includes the good and the bad. This was a very entertaining 400 plus pages. You don't have to be fans to enjoy this book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|better controls would give it a five star. more games too. thank you. blab blab blab blab blah blab blab.
145162445X|5.0|OK, there some math -  but you don't have to do it as it's worked out for you but you do have to think.  One of the most pleasurable experiences I have reading this book is following along with the though processes of people who are much brighter than I am. Sometimes I manage to work out the end of a paragraph before I get to it. That really makes me feel smart,  In all seriousness this is a book to take into the bath, read over lunch and discover just how worryingly odd the universe is. Krauss is a good writer, his way of taking you on the journey is like that of a tour guide who knows all about the place but is willing to let you grow from ignorance to understanding without making you feel like a tourist.  The growing sense of astonishment, his and yours, makes this one of the best science books of the past five years.

0307949486|1.0|I am not all offended by the sex and violence. I read stories that are darker. I can get through the translation to English. I can even almost see the \\"appeal\\" of Lisbeth Salander. What bothers me about this novel is that it BORING!!!! The mystery is boring. The family of the missing woman is boring. The Swedish politics is boring. The only time my eyes stop drooping as I read this novel is when Lisbeth does show up and even then, she is not worth the hype. I picked this book up because a two people whom opinions I trust when it comes to books absolutely loves this novel. Why, I have no idea, but then again both are insomniacs (and I am as well), and I guess they figure it is to perfect book to put them to sleep. This is one of the all time most overrated novels ever.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is a remarkable film of contrasts. Not just the blatantly obvious contrasts of black and white, rich and poor, free and slave, good and evil, courage and cowardice, or between those fighting for equality and those fighting to keep others from being equal. The film does a great job in showing the considerable contrast within Christianity itself. The conflict between the compassionate, loving, understanding attitude, contrasted with the fearful, vengeful, punishing attitude, all within groups of the same religion. Although, some may argue, this is inherent in man's nature, i.e., a \\"Lord of the Flies\\" type of characteristic.<br /><br />The true contrast is between faith and fear, although both are basically the same, belief. For example, if you have a fear of snakes then you must believe in the ability of a snake to harm you or you would not fear it. If a shepherd cannot get his sheep to follow by faith and trust, he drives them with fear using the dogs. We see this contrast in religions that emphasize either an extreme punishment or an extreme reward. The film is remarkable in the way it demonstrates the power of both faith and fear. The oppressed stand in faith against all odds prejudicial to them and the oppressors spew fear and hate in order to subjugate them. People will either recognize faith, love and hope, or they will recognize fear and hate and will lean toward one or the other.<br /><br />Fear causes torment, which leads to hate. A person is driven by fear and hate and begins to recognize the familiar communal voice of fear and hate around them. This voice redirects the fear and hate against whomever or whatever it chooses. Any inhibition is removed by destroying the morals and conscience through self-righteousness and self-justification. The voice, which is the actual source of the fear, then becomes the controlling influence. Depending on the source, fair and balanced, if truthfully noted, is actually fear and bias.<br /><br />The thing about contrastis that you can see perspective very clearly and this film refuses to allow any gray areas. No matter how much Hilly Holbrook tries to justify her iniquitous ways by lying to others and herself, you see through it without question. The scene where Celia comes to the bridge party and Hilly has everyone hide, even though the driveway and street are filled with cars. Or the benefit she holds for hungry African children, while at the same time she subjugates, persecutes, and oppresses the same in her own household and community. Or by taking pride in her warped sense of Christian charity by helping her maid by actually not helping her. Hilly lives in self-delusion and believes her own lies and thinks she has everyone else fooled also. Curiously, it is not Hilly's character that I find the most disgusting and offensive. Racists, bigots, homophobes, hate and fear-mongers can be recognized, we see them for what they really are, controlled by fear. It's Elizabeth's character that I find the most disturbing. The level of cowardice she exhibits by being a pawn is horrible. She doesn't realize she is simply being used. Hilly does not care for Elizabeth or anyone else, she controls them through fear in order to become substantial in her own eyes and those she deceives.<br /><br />The films strong message shows the only path to true freedom. Only by accepting the truth can you truly be free. If you continue to lie to yourself eventually you will meet someone who refuses to acknowledge the facade. Having the courage to define yourself and refusing to allow others to tell you how you should live your life is true freedom. Freedom from fear.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun little game's that I sit and play with the kids. Most of the games are easy and fun. the kids like that they have to earn money in order to unlock new games. it gives them a challenge
B005HP2JAM|2.0|This movie is good for maybe 10 minutes.  The rest is just a rumbling essay on the beauty and importance of this finding, which I think is so corny and bordering on maudlin romanticism. This movie was shot in handheld cheap cameras converted to 3D and you could tell how shoody it was done.  I love great discoveries, but this one was really stretching this one discovery too thinly over an hour an a half, most of it sepculative rather than factual I would say. I love documentaries but this is not even worth 5 bucks in my honest assessment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is soooooo fun I played it for hours mi kindle almost burnt out fun fun fun fun fum
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very addictive. Lots of games and loads of fun. Highly recommend for anyone looking to kill some time and wants to have fun doing it.

B004GYY714|3.0|App works great...BUT..california residents beware! There is no disclaimer that many local stations are restricted by broadcaster.  I know it is not the ap makers fault...but I feel that they have the obligation to let users know of this possible situation.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|I stumbled upon the Decemberists quite by accident. I bought The King is Dead after reading the reviews. I was not dissapointed. I have been playing it over and over for 2 weeks now. My wife is going to throw me out of the house if I don't stop playing it. I will be purchasing earlier albums.
B001B1UO6W|5.0|I am a very happy customer! The DVD came fast and right on time, the item was as posted new and sealed.
B006KHQ2RW|4.0|This was a pretty good movie, but not at all worth the $50.00 that I paid for it.   Wait until the cost is $10.00 for a normal case version and you won't be kicking yourself.  Falatin
B000QFW7UA|5.0|This was a gift for my son in law who only had a video of this movie.  I had it shipped to Texas since we were going to be there for Christmas.  When I opened the box from Amazon I was amazed at all that was in the box with the movie.  Of course I didn't read everything from the Amazon site, I only picked what my daughter told me to get.  We were all pleasantly surprised and watched the movie as well on Christmas night.  Great value for what we got!
B003L77GRO|5.0|I love the writing on Dexter and thought the 5th season one of the best. The order was placed right before I left for the holidays with with my family, so I did not expect to receive it in time. To my surprise, it came before I left so I was able to enjoy watching it (I must confess, in one sitting... but I do that with compelling books as well) and then give it to my wasband who is also a fan.
B0055SWM08|5.0|a beautiful small game of challenge without frustration. well worth the token fee. the great grey wandering opossum ambles through the fields of fragrant olive blossoms.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|needs default for reminders it's annoying to add as a separate action n multiple items should be able to be edited together like several things I have to buy today. I have to change the due date for each one -annoying
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I have to say that I am completely in love with how my kindle fire looks in this! It really does look<br />like an old fashion book everyone that sees it talks about how great it looks. I really couldn't be more pleased.
B004UID2LC|1.0|did not install. this app asks to have access to your personal information. why? isn't a downloader? I am passing. Good luck.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app, being a collection of games is actually quite fun. if you just want to kill time and have variety get this app. if you are looking for smooth, well performing games, don't get this. the games have issuses but are still fun for the most part.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|:) fun game for kids of all ages.  easy to hard with level select uses fun graphics. plus you cant beat free
B006UW9M4C|5.0|All I can say is this IS the standard for songwriting and melodic content.Riot are gods Tony,Mark,Mike,Don and Bobby are truly masters of their own respective crafts and they somehow weave a web of complex riffs and changes into a completely catchy and unforgettable album which will stay on your mind all day and night from track 1 to 11.Now don't just buy this because I literally never stopped dreaming of Tony moore's return since 1990 buy it because you absolutely will not be disappointed.I could go on forever about this disc so I will end this review with this: THANK YOU RIOT FOR COMING BACK AND MAKING ME A VERY HAPPY METALHEAD! I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Syncs with Google calendars seamlessly. This is a life saver.  My hubby and I can put our school schedules on there.  it is wonderful! Needless to say its kind of depressing the lack of free time !  This app doesn't disappoint.  Its very close to the one  that auto-syncs with Google on android except better because you can keep your tasks and they sync as well.  lovley!
B005KELQEU|5.0|I bought this case for the Kindle 2, and it fits perfectly. It seems too big for newer kindles, and that might cause it to move around and damage it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app is pretty and usefully. it accurately give the currentcwesther and upcoming by the hour. this is z must have app.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good app to pass the time away. you do need a lot of points to unlock new games though.
B002PLALCO|5.0|This concert DVD is one of the best productions I have!  Pink is incredible with elaborate sets, costume chages, dancers, slides, beds, and as always, her acrobatic skills are showcased!  I can watch this over and over - and it's great for background at a party - people really get into what she is doing.  Must Own!
B003Y5HWJU|2.0|Production values - great.  Character development - not so much.  Plot - even less so.  The characters are cardboard cutouts moving through their set pieces.  Don Bescimi in the title role - it's like Don Knotts playing Don Corleone, for pete's sake!  Lots of gratuitous nudity, but it's not enough to save this series - glad I'm only in for the first season.
B00650SSWG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  I laughed out loud a few times which I was not expecting.  I did not expect much from this movie but it was really great!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|I  LOVE Zooey Deschanel  and heard so much about this CD  that I just had to buy it.  Played it driving down the highway to Christmas celebrations.  She  &  Him  are super together.
B005KAJPY2|5.0|Nothing extraordinarily surprising about this album except it finds this band at the top of its game.  Great Techno electro EBM whatever stuff that is song centric and every song is strong (Outside of the tired slightly stale and ubiquitous opening instrumental that all these bands do so predictably...).<br /><br />This is hook driven electonic album that has very few weak points.  They haven't ventured, like Covenant did this year, into anything particularly different from their sound, but still, when they are on, they are heavy in my rotation.<br /><br />It's electronic music at its finest.
0061673730|5.0|The book I ordered came in time for christmas despite being ordered very late in the game.  The book was exactly what I expected.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is an ok game I would recommend it for some people but it could be better so for some people download it
B0063IH60K|4.0|there is a hidden &quot;ad&quot; next to the deck where you tap to flip the nxt card :(.... so i am glad i cant see it but it takes me to some creaky movie trailer.
1451627289|4.0|Ten years ago this month, Stephen King made the announcement that he was retiring from writing. I remember hearing the announcement and feeling a sense of desertion. It was King's book Misery that I read as a senior in high school that started my love for reading. Since then, I have read all of his books and while some have been better than others, I've enjoyed every single one of them. Fortunately, King has not been a man of his word. Since he announced his retirement, King has published a dozen or so more books and there's both another Dark Tower book and a sequel to The Shining coming soon.   One of my favorite early books by King is The Dead Zone. In it, the main character Johnny Smith wakes from a coma to discover that when he touches people, he has a brief vision of their future. When that ability reveals to him that a local politician will eventually become the President of the United States and start a nuclear war, he struggles with what steps, if any, he should take to prevent that from happening. He asks himself the question: If I had the ability to go back in time and kill Hitler before he became the leader of Germany and caused World War II, should I do it? In 11/22/63, King comes back to that idea of going back and changing the past to create a better future, but instead of Hitler, this time it's Lee Harvey Oswald's life that he explores whether the world would be better off without.  There's a hole in the state of Maine, a hole that a person can enter and arrive at 11:58 A.M. on September 9, 1958. The hole is in the backroom of a local diner, a diner owned by Al who has been going through the hole for quite some time. Initially it was just to buy his food supplies at 1950's prices, but eventually his purpose in going back became more substantial - to prevent the assassination of JFK in 1963. But Al's time is running short. Even though every time he returns through the hole, only 2 minutes has passed in 2011, he has been spending years at a time in 1958and his life-long smoking habit has put him on death's door. So he introduces Jake Epping, a loyal customer of his, to his secret and wants Jake to try to do what Al has been unable to accomplish.  I should say here that I love stories about time travel. I love the paradoxes it creates and the usually unforeseen ripple effect that comes with it. There have been a lot of great stories that involve it and 11/22/63 is one of the best. As he usually does, King has taken an otherwise ordinary character and placed him in extraordinary circumstances and then just seems to take a step back and watch along with all his readers to see what happens.   It's not rare that I enjoy a book that I'm reading. But what is rare is when a book is so good that I'm tempted to skip to the end of the book to see how things turn out. I've never done that, and I never will, but I was constantly fighting the urge to do it with 11/22/63. The story is fantastic. Needless to say, I'm enjoying King's retirement immensely.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|God's Word is always beautiful! Easy to navigate, and audio choice is a definate plus!! I had downloaded the free bible on my other kindle, but this app is so much easier to read from. I highly recommend it for any age. Perfect for people who can't read well but still want to enjoy the Word.
1451648537|5.0|So much to learn from Jobs's life, this book is absolute must reading.  At a time of great anxiety about America's economic future, it is massively uplifting to remind oneself how much an American individual and an American company improved our world.  Everyone needs to learn how profoundly Jobs altered the landscape in so many areas of our lives.  All can find inspiration in his fundamental thesis of \\"less is more\\" and the relentlessness with which he applied this approach to design and operation of our dearest consumer products. It is painful to think about a world devoid of the contributions Jobs made that we now take for granted but might not have occurred without him, i.e., a world whose personal computer hardware industry (prior to Jobs) foisted on us clunky, forbidding machines and whose software industry (prior to Jobs) gave us incomprehensible error messages and totally non-intuitive operating systems.  As a real estate professional, I devoured Isaacson's chapter on how Jobs conceived, designed, and implemented the Apple stores that have become the world's highest grossing retailers -- this phenomenal success following immediately on the heels of the abject failure of Gateway Computers at bricks-and-mortar selling.  Gateway was pulling in 250 customers a week, whereas Apple began by doing over 3 times Gateway's volume in just one day.  How and why Jobs accomplished this success is must reading for all retailers and real estate developers.<br /><br />One of the dozens of small take-aways is Jobs's preference to conduct important one-on-one meetings by walking around Cupertino or Palo Alto, a practice I intend to launch in New York this spring.<br /><br />While much has been made of his quick temper and harsh rants directed at under-performing employees, the book gives many examples of Jobs's mordant sense of humor and irony.  Told by one of his doctors that cancer might soon be manageable, Jobs remarked: \\"I'm either going to be one of the first to be able tooutrun a cancer like this, or I'm going to be one of the last to die from it... Either among the first to make it to shore, or the last to get dumped.\\"<br /><br />Except for the final tragic end, I smiled over and over in appreciation of the breakthroughs that Jobs wrought and the skill with which Isaacson has told his story.
B005K17RU0|4.0|love it. its there when ever I need it.  that's all I Have to say.  I'm done out what ever blab blab blah
B005JLN9Z8|3.0|i hate saying this, since i think these guys are fantastic, but this album is not anywhere near as good as the first one... here's why... the first album was smarter, more intelligent in it's humor. it trusted you to make the distinction that the songs were funny if you payed attention. you could actually mistake them for 'serious' songs. THAT'S what made them funny!   there is no chance of that here. no one is going to 'not get the joke', and that's a shame... there are a few bright spots, but it's not as good as the first album... (second if you count metal skool)   but kudos for the 'distressed vinyl album cover' look, complete with old 'tower records' sticker...
0307891372|5.0|Fantastic book and great service? Very hard to find and could only get it at amazon. Sent to Australia and received it within a week.
0525478817|5.0|I must admit, having only read a couple of John Green's books before but also being a dedicated Nerdfighter, I was hesitant to purchase The Fault in Our Stars. Before even reading it, I felt like it was being over-hyped and I've been disappointed so many times before from books that were proclaimed \\"exceptional\\" when I only felt \\"eh\\" about 'em.   The Fault in Our Stars breaks that cycle. For the first time in a long while, I felt something while reading. I laughed. I cried. I was excited. I felt disappointment (along with the characters. not outside the book). All of these emotions were wrapped up in a not-so-nicely wrapped package that was bursting at the seams. It's intriguing to think that something so simply written could leave so many difficult thoughts and questions seeping through my pores.   I'm disappointed that I finished so quickly but it's a book that needs to be read by everyone. Even the non-readers.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A well designed and executed application for cross platform sharing . The more I use it the more I need it. Simply superb.
1451627289|5.0|In this novel King shows us what it would take to save Kennedy, and for a brief section of the book even shows us what would could have happened if JFK had lived,and how the little everyday things we do have so much effect on how time pans out. As usual King was almost overly descriptive at times but his descriptions were, as always, captivating and drew me right into the story. I like how he ended the story in a Mass town not far from where I live, oh King and his New England centered writing.
1931559317|5.0|Bought this for my Nephew for Christmas. He loved it. One of the best books for telescope use on the market. He had many other books and none compared to this one.
1577314808|5.0|This book was the best spirituality book I ever read, it truly is filled with thoughts that reveal the only truth that all religions seek which is the connection with the NOW, with the divinity, with your very self. The book awakens you from the unconcious state that we are due to our minds and gives light how we can connect with ourselves, with our essence. I liked the way the book was written in an question-answer manner and giving daily situations examples that one can relate to. This is the starting point for anyone who wants to be free and to be happy. Excelent book from Mr. Tolle.
B004WR125O|1.0|Bought this with HT-RC360 and UWF-1 ONKYO should be ashamed of this junk, signal strength is 17% and my router is 35 feet away, cannot access any thing on the NET option I say again anything, downloaded firmaware update blah blah blah and still same problem.. I can go over to my neighbors house with 3 of my laptops and get full bars. My ps3 and Wii are wireless right next to the receiver and have no problem junk.  Going to return
B000003N89|5.0|Dianna Krull is an amazing singer. I would put her in the class of Linda Rondstat (when she was not screaming!). She has a very appealing sounding  voice, and a bit more earthy than Linda Rondstat's (who has an extremely clear voice), but still VERY appealing. The songs on this CD are not as nice as on some of her other CDs, but since it is a tribute to Nat, it is nnoetheless, very nice. You will be captivated!
B004EPYZSU|3.0|The movie had a lot of action.  No nasty.  so that was goood.  but there was zero plot. where did the space girl come from?  and why did the aliens want the gold?  Not much for having a point. So it was mind numbing entertainment.  You didn't have to think.  Again, NO PLOT.
B00464CU7M|4.0|I learned about this British preformer form the Dr Who TV show, which she appeared on in one of the Christmas special shows as well. She has an amazing voice an is very beautiful as well!
B006GG1KOC|5.0|My 3 year-old really likes this game. It makes him think and also gives me the opportunity to improve his vocabulary by engaging him in a discussion about each screen. I ask him to explain his choice before he taps on a picture. BTW, the app is working perfectly on the Kindle Fire.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|This female vocalist sings and plays (piano) jazz songs. She is outstanding and the audio quality on this CD is amazing. It sounds like she is in my living room when I play it! Highly recommended - even if you are not a jazz fan!
B006GG1KOC|2.0|this game is for kids and it took me 7 minutes to beat the whole game. I wouldn't have gotten it even it was free before.
0060531053|5.0|This book is quite thorough, including pictures as needed. It Describes, lists, explains all aspects of beermaking and the ingredients used. It explains origins, and helps with the understanding of why steps are done and done in a specific order. I would buy it again and I would recommend it to any brewer.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great on my kindle fire and like how the current temp stays on screen, I would recommend it to everyone.

B005KR6OBM|1.0|I absolutely LOVE The Big Bang Theroy and so does my best friend and was really excited to see the first four seasons bundled at such a great price. Received my order quickly and securely; with each season wrapped separately in cellophane. HOWEVER....I am very disappointed (actually kind of pissed off) to find that these are bootlegs. If you are wondering how I know this...I bought the series for my friend for her birthday, she just so happen to buy me the same set from BestBuy for Christmas (which I so happen to receive in the mail today; and what luck my package from Amazon arrived today as well). To my happy surprise when I opened my gift from her,  she has purchase me the exact same thing I bought for her birthday; Seasons 1-4 of The Big Bang Theroy. UNFORTUNATELY are gifts are not the EXACT same; her set is authentic and mine is  bootleg. if I'd wanted to buy a bootleg I could have gotten them way cheaper then this. Without even opening the other box I knew these weren't authentic. #1 the coloring is off #2 inside the  DVD's case the layout is different and finally piece de resistance the damn booklets were haphazardly folded INCORRECTLY and just thrown in the DVD case.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Quick and easy to install.  Easy to open and play. Great app to pass the time.  If you like playing a quick game of Solitaire, I would recommend this one.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|TuneIn Radio Pro is awesome! I live in an area that has poor radio reception, but with TuneIn I can listen to local stations, or whatever genre I want. The controls are very easy to navigate and the sort and search functions are fantastic. I use this app every day and would hate to be without it.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|My favorite series is Sherlock Holmes.  All classics.  Always interesting to re-read.  Just when you thought you might know the direction of the mystery, there's always a twist.  Fantastic series of stories.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I have tried most of the office apps out there, and this is the best one by far. It has the easiest to use interface, the best looking screens, and it is the fastest one I've tried. Don't bother with the others. This is the one to have!
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|I first bought this book in hardback in the late 1980s when it was first published. It was an amazing book, and a look at a young man going to war in RVN. I've read it several times, and each read is as good as the first. Mason describes his feelings in such a real way  -- his doubts and fears, his uncertainty, and his determination to do his job regardless of the situation. One of the most touching parts is when we learn at the end of the book what happened to him when he got out of the Army. I won't spoil that one for you.  If you like good military writing, or just good writing period, get this book.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I needed this to allow my in-car iPod cable from Infiniti (2009 G37) to charge my new iPhone 4.  This did that perfectly!  It is also high quality and attaches/detaches like you'd expect from a good product.<br /><br />To top it off, I had a question and I sent it to CableJive via their web site.  I had a reply within a half day, with an accurate answer on how to combine this with other cabling.<br /><br />So, great product, and great supplier with great support.  Nice!
0385344325|3.0|Fun for Reacher fans in that it offers a glimpse into how he started on his path, but only average as far as the series goes.  The villains are relatively tame, and Child doesn't quite pull off the Reacher-romance plot line - a bit repetitive and, well, boring.  Since I read these books for the action and intrigue, I found myself disappointed.
B005D4Y522|3.0|Can this be a cycle of 2011. The initial rection is may be not.The packing is similar to the chailly and deserved 5 stars.It can be compared like a beautiful box of chocholate but  the chocolate is of  the mediore quality.So far Symphony 1 and 2 is slow that it is a bore even Mozart and Haydn  is faster in pace.Is it how Beethoven symphonies  should sound like  or other conductors are taking a faster speed.Chailly  take 5 cd but Thielemann take 6cd for the complete symphonies and  there is no overtures.There is a bonus DVD that is more like  an advertisement for DVD box set.The sound is no comparison to sonic sound of Chailly.If anyone disagree,then tell why and recommend a cycle that is superior in sound and well conducted than Chailly.I am quite surprise that this box set was released in USA before UK and yet no one has review it is now  out of stock from Amazon USA.I  am waiting for the review from Gramophone magazine (UK) and Fanfare (USA) to give us a realistic evaluation of the newest kid on the block.I can only compare this cycle like drinking a  tall glass of water with a lot of ice when I only want just a glass of plain water to drink.Any other Beethoven cycle on the horizon that will challenge Chailly or your own version.Happy listening and can you pass  the Bourbon.Cheer.
0374158460|5.0|I can't say I'm surprised there are so many negative reviews of Freedom, but in my opinion the reason is tied more to its social critique than to its merits as a novel. I feel the need to stick up for this brilliant American novel. A disclaimer: almost every facet of its plot has some personal relevance to me: environmentalism, higher education, indie rock, relationships, love and lust, politics, and perhaps, most importantly, FREEDOM.  Franzen cleverly weaves a commentary on the wages of freedom into many parts of this book.  As you may have noticed in your own life, it's fascinating how something we as Americans universally revere, our servicemen have died for, and the country was arguably founded for, freedom, can make us so damned miserable.  It's just a thing of beauty when a novelist can make brilliantly painted characters, topical social commentary, and a deeper introspection on the meaning of life work in concert with each other.  The novel's views can be a hard pill to swallow if you don't agree with the politics of Franzen's deeply flawed hero-of-sorts, Walter Berglund.  He's a rabid, iconoclastic environmentalist.  The fact that I do agree with him probably enhanced my enjoyment of the novel, but even if I didn't, I HOPE I would be able to see past the topical issues and still appreciate the Tolstoy-like portrait of a family that Franzen has composed.  Walter is far from the only interesting character in the novel.  In fact, it would be a worthy read just for its portraits of Walter's mistake-prone wife Patty, his rocker best friend Richard Katz, and his precocious son Joey.    I know that I really like a book when I avoid other things to read it, when I stay up into the wee hours of the morning reading it furiously, when I feel like the characters are actually people I know, when I'm sad it's over, and when I'm legitimately jealous of the author for his craftsmanship.  All of these characteristics emerged when I read Freedom.  Franzen is so brilliant it's not even fair.  Read this book.  I predict it will be remembered as a modern classic long after most of the other books of 2010 are forgotten.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Comic-book lovers, fans of alternate history, and fantasy-prone moviegoers in general are all sure to find something to love about X-Men: First Class. That rare, elusive fourth chapter that actually manages to pull a failing film series out of a full-on nosedive, X-Men: First Class folds an involving origins story into a dynamic fantasy adventure, and succeeds in delivering both thanks to a strong cast, a tight script, and solid direction.<br /><br />Set in the era before Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr became mortal enemies as Professor X and Magneto, respectively, director Matthew Vaughn's X-Men: First Class follows the two former allies as they lead a powerful team of mutants on a mission to save the planet from nuclear annihilation. Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) were just young men when it began to appear as if the world was careening toward destruction. As the Doomsday Clock ticks faster toward midnight, the time comes to take action. Realizing they could use their unique powers to avert a global thermonuclear war during the Bay of Pigs crisis, the two powerful mutants launch an intense recruitment campaign with the support of Dr. Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne) and the CIA. Before long, Charles and Erik have assembled a crack team that includes Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), Banshee (Caleb Landry Jones), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Angel (Zoe Kravitz), Havok (Lucas Till), and Darwin (Edi Gathegi). Meanwhile, the malevolent Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to plunge the world into war with the help of villainous mutants Riptide (Alex Gonzalez), Azazel (Jason Flemyng), and Emma Frost (January Jones). In the process of saving humanity, however, Charles and Erik clash, setting the stage for Professor X to lead the X-Men in the fight for good as Magneto and the Brotherhood spread chaos and destruction on a global scale.<br /><br />It's no secret that comic-book fans can be a fickle bunch. But who can blame them? It seems like every year some Hollywood hotshot makes a misguided attempt at producing a comic-sourced summer tent pole, yet botches the job by thinking they know better than the folks responsible for the source material. In the past decade, even Comic-Con, the massive annual San Diego convention that draws comic geeks from every corner of the globe, has essentially become little more than a free showcase for the latest Hollywood superhero epics. Considering the fact that director Bryan Singer's enthusiastically received X-Men and X2 were followed by a pair of sequels that practically had loyal fans of the comic foaming at the mouth (X-Men: The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine), it had started to look like the once-successful series had abruptly run out of steam. By looking to the past for inspiration, though, writer/director Matthew Vaughn and co-screenwriters Ashley Miller, Zack Stentz, and Jane Goldman managed not only to find a grand-scale origins story that's actually worth telling, but the character dynamics to give the drama genuine impact, as well.<br /><br />The rivalry between Professor X and Magneto has long been a staple of the X-Men series, both on the pages of comic books and in motion pictures. Recognizing that, the creative team behind X-Men: First Class made the wise choice to explore the events that pushed the two former allies to opposite extremes: one devoted to bettering humanity, the other sworn to destroy it. And by filling those roles with talented actors McAvoy and Fassbender, Vaughn and his team ensured that the character drama would pack as big a punch as the action sequences. If the complex relationship between Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr failed to resonate in X-Men: First Class, the film would have been dead in the water. Fortunately, it does, and the energy of that conflict seems to send positive shockwaves through the rest of the production. On the heels of her breakthrough performance in the critically acclaimed Appalachian film noirWinter's Bone, Lawrence brings a deep soulfulness to the character of Mystique as she struggles with the stigma of being \\"different,\\" and coming off his deliciously sleazy performance in James Gunn's Super, Bacon literally takes power-mad villainy to nuclear extremes.<br /><br />Try as they may, no filmmaker is likely to produce a faithful comic-book adaptation capable of coaxing die-hard fans and casual moviegoers into a human pyramid of mutual adoration, but X-Men: First Class might just come close. Not only because the writers display a certain amount of reverence toward their iconic subjects, but also because the performers are well up to the task, and the action holds consequences that are at once deeply intimate yet potentially devastating for all of humanity.<br />Overall, I give this a FULL PRICE rating!!!!!ngs a deep soulfulness to the character of Mystique as she struggles with the stigma of being \\"different,\\" and coming off his deliciously sleazy performance in James Gunn's Super, Bacon literally takes power-mad villainy to nuclear extremes.

B006GG1KOC|1.0|This app is for children? If your child is under 2 yrs. old or brain dead, then this app is for them.  This app and it's challenges are a joke. My 4 yr. old said it's for babies. It's like a paint-by-number and there is only 1 number.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|I think is a great app and I'm excited to share it with my niece. I just wish they would say the theme of the set at the end. Just 1 or 2 were confusing, but it would a nice teaching aid if I could give hints to my niece like &quot;It's something you hold, which one don't you hold?&quot; But I like this app.
1611760100|5.0|Crossed is the second novel in Ally Condie's dystopian young adult trilogy.  I listened to and really enjoyed the first novel in the series, Matched, last month, and was eager to learn what happened to my favorite characters, Cassia, Ky, and Zander.<br /><br />At the end of Matched, Ky, has been taken by the society to fight on the front lines and Cassia vows to find him.  Crossed is the journey that Cassia takes to find Ky.  After her family has been sent to the outer provinces, Cassia, volunteers for a remote work detail that will get her closer to finding Ky.  Cassia also starts to discover information about the elusive rebellion.  Ky meanwhile is trying to survive an endless war that makes no sense.  The Society tells the young soldiers that they will be able to become citizens after they serve their six months, but in reality, no one makes it that long.  The young soldiers have no ammunition for their weapons,  and are fired upon by remote airships of the faceless, nameless enemy.  Zander only appears once in this novel, but his presence is always felt.<br /><br />I enjoyed Matched, but I loved Crossed.  I thought that this second novel in the series was a much stronger novel.  It still involved the love triangle, but it focused more on the action and adventure.  Much of the narrative moves along in a road trip format with Cassia and Ky trying to escape from the Society and also find each other.  New interesting characters are introduced, but the focus stays on the main characters that we know and love.<br /><br />I felt that Matched seemed like a young adult version of George Orwell's 1984, and I felt that Crossed was even more so.  There is even a scene where the main characters are interviewed and have to remember not to break under their interrogation.  The nameless continuous war in Crossed is similar to the same type of war in 1984, although in Crossed we get firsthand experience at that war.  As in 1984, the characters that do not accept society and conform to their standards find themselves on the outside.<br /><br />The Matched audiobook was read only by Kate Simses as the voice of Cassia, the teenaged narrator.  I thought she did a fantastic job and did indeed sound like a teenage girl with angst.  She continued on as Cassia in Crossed, but Jack Riccobono was added on as the voice of Ky who narrates pretty much every other chapter in Crossed.  I really enjoyed the addition and thought he did a great job.  I really liked the dual narration.  This book had a lot of action and it made it the type of book I couldn't wait to listen to again.<br /><br />I really liked the ambiguous ending and the secret that we learned about Zander.  I really enjoyed how the novel focused on Cassia and Ky's journey to find each other, but also their own journey of self-discovery.  Cassia and Ky have very different outlooks and goals in life.  Will their love keep them together, or will Cassia discover that her goals line up more with Zander?<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed Crossed and I can't wait for the third novel to come out.  November 2012 better get here fast!  If you also enjoy young adult dystopian novels, or if you don't know what that means, but you love a good action adventure with a love triangle, Crossed is for you!<br /><br />I received Crossed as a digital audiobook to review from Penguin Audiobooks.

B0041T52S6|5.0|OK, maybe the title is a bit of an overstatement. I'm in my 20's, and I think this movie displays what my generation wants reality to look like. This movie merges video game \\"highlights\\" into daily life, such as: a hot girl melting snow around her, receiving coins from a defeated enemy, and cool sound effects when you do something good (or bad).<br /><br />There is a great story and great acting. I am told that it follows the comic books really closely.<br /><br />Definitely a cool movie.
1579128149|5.0|Beautiful, exquisite book.  Photos, writing, paper.  Truly captures your imagination while providing facts that are dazzling.  You'll score high in the science category of any trivia game.  A book worth owning.

B0034G4P9E|3.0|I'm a pretty avid follower of MMA, it's kinda hard to keep up with ALL the promotions but I've seen almost every UFC produced and seen very many of the Pride events.  I recognized all the actual players in MMA off-screen and know the history behind the story of Koba, I think they did a really neat thing of trying to replicate that story for the casual observer but the fight sequences, while choreographed fairly well to simulate real violence in the cage, were still pretty odd and couldn't shake their hollywood choreography feeling.  I recognized Anthony \\"Rumble\\" Johnson (Midnight), Nate Marquardt, the others seemed like actors.<br /><br />What I found to be really good were the performances by the supporting cast--Tommy Rierdon and Patty Conlon (Nick Nolte).  Nick Nolte actually did a really good job of portraying a recovering alcoholic trying to make penance for his transgressions against his sons in the past.  The story developed that plotline pretty well.  Tommy's character was easily the most intriguing AND polarizing, you really wanna like this guy but he's got some real demons but overall, you can't ignore the charisma his stage presence brings to the film.  The main character's performance was mostly humdrum for me...sometimes he seemed credible in his character and other times, it was very 80s-esque trying to recapture the magic of Rocky and the underdog overcoming the insurmountable odds before him.<br /><br />That was my problem with the film, it carried 80s-like predictability and some of the fighting was just not very authentic, the 5-min rounds lasted maybe 60 seconds on-screen and it's painfully obvious, I think they should've been a little more faithful with trying to capture that element of MMA, it's not a big deal and prolly won't take anything away from the movie for most, but for the hardcore MMA fans out there, watch it with your tongue in cheek.<br /><br />Patty Conlon, Tommy Rierdon, and the rest of the supporting cast really shined but the story line had its pitfalls reminiscent of 80s good overcomes evil films and the main actor borrowed too much credibility on credit.  To the point where you realize the credit will not be paid back!<br /><br />Looking forward to seeing more productions with the actor who played Tommy Rierdon, I recommend this as a strong 'should watch' film, but falling just shy of a 'must watch' film.iscent of 80s good overcomes evil films and the main actor borrowed too much credibility on credit.

0061122416|5.0|You'll say Ahhh throughout the reading of this precious gem of a book.  As a regular fast page turner, I restrained myself with this irresistible tale and savored a few pages at a time, so the joy of reading this treasure lasted longer.  The Alchemist takes you on a magical adventure as you follow a shepherd boy traveling far from home searching for a promised, buried treasure. The people he meets and the places his journey takes him, teaches him the lesson of listening to the song of his heart and where his true treasure really lies.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This is great. My son is not quite old enough yet, but I downloaded it anyway so when he gets a little bigger I will have some apps appropriate for him.
B000001E8S|5.0|I had this cd at one time, but I think I lost it so after all this time I needed to have it again to my collection. Bono and the boys have shown that they are capable of stepping outside of their various styles and put together a work of art once again.<br /><br />  Brian Eno also gets credit for this cd as well because alot of his creativity has gone into this cd.<br /><br />  My favorite track is \\"Miss Sareavo\\" because it's just such an originall piece and Bono shows that he can change his voice style. And the fact that Pavaroti sang on it as well really makes the song a great piece!<br /><br />  The Edge, Larry, and Adam sure did contribute to the cd as well with their own work and it shows. It's not what you'd call a \\"U2\\" cd based on many of their works, but you know it's them because it has the \\"flavor\\" in all the songs..<br /><br />  This cd really rounds out their sound because of their new wave, rock, blues, and alternative stylings.<br /><br />  U2 always reaches for new and different directions with their music and \\"The Passengers\\" makes it very clear..<br /><br />This cd would be on the same team as \\"Zooropa, Achtung Baby\\", and \\"Pop\\"...

I read the first two books immediatly. Catching Fire, the final book in the series, couldn't come out soon enough!
159514188X|5.0|I just finished reading this book 10 minutes ago. I am still amazed, in shocks, and contemplation. This book is a must read by teenagers and parents alike. It has the \\"aha\\" effect for young readers, quite like the move Breakfast Club...but a little more intense of subject matter. It is important for everyone to know just how one little thing that we do can affect someone's life in so many ways.

I wanted to know more adventures. I guess it is always better to leave the audience wanting more.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It has a delightful way of taking the viewer on a fantasy trip to Paris in the days of Hemingway and many other great authors, artists, and minds of the early 1900's.

0525478817|5.0|One of those books where you finish it in a matter of hours and spend 20 minutes lying on the floor digesting it. Then you find yourself reopening it in your mind while you drive to the grocery store, while you wash your hair, while you eat breakfast. You run your hands over the cover, feeling the shiny newness, just because you can, and wonder with trepidation how many rereadings it will take to scrape the newness away. You panic and tear your room apart looking for it when it's a meter away from where you thought you left it.You parse the font and the texture of the paper. The book is irrevocably part of you. Holding it tightly and feeling your pulse radiating back at you, the book might as well be alive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good for killing time, waiting. for the bus. or at the dry cleaners.  or in line at the super market. oh well.

B005FUTBV4|4.0|Kevin Smith movies suck.<br /><br />As someone who is reading this review, or has reviewed films in the past, you can probably find a better word to use to elaborate my point.  As a formidable teen in the 90s, nothing impressed me more than garage films that were funny, realistic, and jarring all at the same time.  Clerks fit that bill.  In fact, it still fits that bill whenever I feel the urge to time travel back to a place where cinema was better and creativity soared higher in Hollywood than today.  Wunderkind Smith crafted a voice of a generation with this singular film, and since its release in 1994 has tried again and again to recreate that talent.  Within the 17 other films he has directed since Clerks, only two have attempted to come close to the excitement that Randal and Dante held.  Personally, those are Chasing Amy and the more recent Zack & Miri Make a Porno (though I credit this more towards the humor of Seth Rogan than Smith's direction), but now I may find myself putting Red State within this elitist mix.<br /><br />(As an aside, I did love Clerks: The Animated Series, but I didn't want to confuse the reader)<br /><br />Before mass hysteria pertaining to this comment, allow me to validate my point.  Coming off the treacherous Cop Out (which had to be turned off early due to utter embarrassment), hesitation rang supreme as I put in the Blu-ray version of Smith's latest outing.  I recall hearing that he decided to distribute this himself, which continued to bode unwell as I hit play on the title screen.  Then, the drops of piano notes hit - and my mind sunk in.  Red State is a film about the power of religion, the horrors of fear, and chaotic representation of terrorism.  It is about Five Points Church, their preacher Albin Cooper, the eradication of \\"sin\\", and those caught in the crossfire.  Sex-crazed teens, a cache of weapons, and a detailed work-oriented John Goodman round out the rest of the plot to this film, which honestly, is the weakest part of Red State. Smith begins our film with what feels like the beginning of the third act, and he is not afraid to keep us focused on that direction.  As our teens fall prey to a petty sting operation set up by Cooper and his congregation, the rest of the movie is set either trying to escape or eradicate.  This is where Smith surprised me.<br /><br />Red State is not a creative film.  Watching it unfold with blood, bullets, and a high body count - one cannot help but see that Smith is merely invading the space that friends Tarantino or Rodriguez already dominate.  Through the shower of carnage and Goodman's screams, one cannot help but see the ghost of Grindhouse past, or any of the more recent torture-porn semi-horror releases.  Yet, as a viewer of all of his epic fails, there is some finesse to Smith's camera.  Horror may even be the wrong genre all together.  He dabbles between the lines of comic and sheer shock, and is successful.  His choice of casting is among the best I have seen in a long time, eerily reminiscent of a Cohen production, Michael Park's Albin Cooper has been grandly ushered into the world of horror genius/villain.  I could, and would have loved, to watch a full two hours of him merely giving sermons or asking for tea.  An actor is only as good as the man giving him the direction, so to credit Park, I must also say that Smith's eye was not dull on this count.  The same can be said for Stephen Root (giving a small, but nuanced performance of a sexually-conflicted sheriff), John Goodman surprising me completely as an Agent trying to do his best amongst erupted chaos, and Melissa Leo countering Park around every turn, giving yet another dirty, grunge performance.  It is these characters - these actors playing these characters - that build Red State into something stronger than anticipated.<br /><br />Red State will never have the shelf longevity of Clerks, nor will it appeal to most audiences as our taste of Smith has dwindled over the years.  BUT, there was something unique about this film that continued to pine in my mind.  I enjoyed Smith's juxtaposition between Goodman's orders and that Cooper felt he was receiving from the Lord.  Stagnant plot holes aside, the scenes were beautifully developed and choreographed.  I especially liked that the arsenal room had a cross light hanging from the ceiling.  The final scene with the horn was a small twist that left a smile on my face, and questioned why Smith hadn't painted with such detail since 1994.  Michael Park deserves an award; even an MTV Award will do, and if anything see Red State for merely the actors that inhabit the idiot box for the hour and a half.  A small, insignificant glimmer of hope will appear to those that dreamed of a triumphant Smith cinematic return.<br /><br />Then, like this viewer typing this today, we will accidentally turn to the \\"Making of...\\" on the same disc; hear Smith discuss why he made this film - and with shattered hope return to the original idea:<br /><br />Kevin Smith movies suck.ntinued to pine in my mind.

B0036S4C6G|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I really loved it.  Yes, the \\"layer cake\\" of chapters and characters makes this a challenging book at times.  (I read the Kindle edition and would sometimes search for a character who was mentioned in a previous chapter to refresh my memory.)  But this is a beautiful, thought-provoking read.  I enjoyed the style and the character development from chapter to chapter.

1451626657|1.0|All I can say about this book is that \\"I don't get it.\\"  Or what I do get, I don't like.  This book is dripping with sarcasm and cynicism, and fails to make any point, in my opinion.  Yes, the world is a cynical place, filled with cynical people, and often times large institutions behave in ways that don't make sense.  I see this every day in life, so writing a book about this aspect of the world does nothing except breed more cynicism.  I have enough, thank you.  The characters are flat, the story is...  ...weird...,  and the apparent point and purpose of the story was waaaay over done.  Like I said, I just didn't get it. I do not often put a book down without finishing it, but I figured my life is too short to waste on this supposed \\"great piece of literary work\\".  It was so dis-engaging, I couldn't get through it.
B006VA3ZT6|3.0|Just watched on PBS.org, and Episode 1 of Season 2 (@ nearly 2 hours long) is indeed entirely watchable--but sadly not as delicious as Season 1, which was an unmitigated pleasure. Regrettably, the creators appear to have decided that having captured a mammoth international audience, it is now their duty to preach to them about the horrors of war and the crippling inequities of a class-bound society. This is most unfortunate because, I don't know about you, but for myself, I am already far more familiar than I care to be with both life's unfairness and its more unpleasant aspects, thanks much, and not yearning at all for additional edification in this gloomy area. Again, just my POV, but that is certainly NOT what delights me about watching Masterpiece, and it would be most unfortunate for the team who make Downton to have taken this smugly self-righteous turn. The human interactions were as fascinating in Season 1 as the costumes and locations fun to ogle. In this viewer's opinion, that's the point of watching:  it makes for a welcome respite from the ugliness of the world and it's inhabitants. Admittedly, one episode is not enough evidence to make a judgment, but the course of the new season does appear to be writ large--already there are leaden servings of the shell shock we now call PTSD, depression, alienation, self-mutilation, suicide and the rest of war's ugly effects on civil society--and I can't say the outlook promises to be nearly so enjoyable as last season. Let's hope I'm wrong, but it does appear success has gone to the show's head, and not in a good way.<br /><br />Additionally, Brideshead Revisited, undeniably the absolute pinnacle of British Television and arguably one of the half dozen most brilliant series in the entire history of the medium, kept coming to mind awkwardly often, and the similarities are clearly no accident.  In some ways, the entire Downton oeuvre is one extended homage to the 1981 Granada TV epic.  That's o.k.  Anything that good is worth trying twice. (Ouch! Except for that truly dreadful movie version!) Nonetheless, despite imitation as sincere flattery, it's beginning to look a tad bumptious to so blatantly ape the Great-House-in-War-Time routine, not to mention Mary's impending nuptials to the craven newspaper magnate, while all the while deeply in love with a social inferior intimately connected to the family, paralleling Julia Flyte's marriage to Rex Mottram, the crass Canadian social climber, so closely it might be said to resemble plagiarism more than flattery.<br /><br />Then again, Brideshead happened over forty years ago, and likely most of Downton's audience has never heard of it.  Which is their loss.  The copy, even as often as it succeeds, still pales mightily before the original, which I watched again not long ago.  It was even better with more of life under my belt from the intervening decades, and I could appreciate much that had gone over my head when first so utterly entranced by Bridehead so many years ago.rying twice.

0061743526|5.0|Beautifully written.  The expression of the dialect of the children, combined with the adult narration is brilliant.  The characters are wonderfully deep and believable, so much that I felt personally connected to the story.  Very engaging and thought provoking plot.  One of my favorite books ever.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really entertaining for the competitive arcade kinds I love it! a lot of games and easy to get points to unlock new ones the strategies of the games surprised me they do keep u on ur toes

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I highly recommend this book.  Though it is truly a full-length novel, it easily captured my attention all the way until the end and I am very much looking forward to the next book in this series.  The in-depth history and incredible details that were provided by the author greatly enhanced the story.  This is one that I will read again just before the release of the next book - that's just how much I liked it!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a good game on the kindle fire. There is no glitches or freezing the game works perfect. I would reccomend this app to anyone and everyone. You should download it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is amazing. and I play it all the time because it has so many different kinds of games and it just amazing. that's all I got to say for it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Ok I get you get points for anything on here and I mean anything but we want to load the app and play the games we want!not load buy with money or sometimes points then play. I'm just saying that's how it should be.
0307949508|3.0|Sometimes the second book is a series is merely a springboard for future events, that appears to be true in \\"The Girl who Plays with Fire.\\" The story line slowly picks up from the first book but with some disconnected elements that neither grow the main character of Lisbeth Salander, nor do they advance the story in any meaningful direction. By the time the ball gets rolling we are subjected to a slowly growing mystery surrounded by limp minded characters who struggle to figure it out. As a reader I was intrigued as to where it was going until I figured it out half way through. After that the fun was gone. The remaining pages lead into unsatisfactory action sequences developed without pretext.<br /><br />The question is, am I still entranced enough to find out where this could possibly go in the third book? The answer is yes. Lisbeth Salander is a good enough character to carry you all the way through. The action of the books, whether captivating or sleepy never seems to hurt her strength as a driving force towards turning the next page.

1569242739|5.0|Seriously, it's that good. I've been baking vegan goodies for five years now, and while I've managed to make things that are good, nothing stood out so much that it made my mouth water just thinking about it or that inspired me to come up with my own variations on the recipes. But after having great success with the few baked goods recipes in Veganomicon, I decided to try out VCTOTW. I am impressed. Very impressed. So are all my adoring fans who keep asking me what cupcakes I'm making next.  Even if you're not vegan, you need to this little book. The flavors of the cupcakes are amazing, the textures are perfect, and the cupcakes are beautiful. I can't rave about it enough. The Pumpkin Chocolate Chip cupcakes made believers out of several of my friends who had no interest in trying vegan baked goods before. Now they're requesting more and even requesting recipes to try for themselves.  The next order I make from Amazon will include the other two books like this one--for pies and cookies. My hat goes off to Isa Chandra Moskowitz and Terry Hope Romero. They are an amazing duo.

0446402389|5.0|This is a densely packed, ingeniously plotted debut novel that hits a home run. There is not a dull moment from start to finish and you will be hanging on for dear life the whole trip.  The novel takes place in Stalinist Russia and the protagonist, Leo, works for the M.G.B, the Soviet Union's dreaded secret police, rounding up and sometimes torturing subversives; that is, anyone who questions the iron fist of the Soviet Union. The novel revolves around a series of killings of young children. The problem is that killings are not officially recognized in the Soviet Union; violent crimes only happen in decadent capitalist countries. In Russia, everyone is happy and there is no reason for violence. Thus, Leo has a difficult time convincing his superiors that horrific crimes are being commented. In fact, he has such a difficult time that he soon finds himself labeled a subversive for challenging the official party line and is sent to the hinterlands. But of course, that is where the high suspense begins.   The best part of the book is the terrifying picture it paints of life under a totalitarian government where everyone spies on everyone, and husbands are even forced to denounce their wives to save themselves. Neighbors turn in neighbors, brothers turn in brothers, and children turn in parents. The atmosphere of paranoia and paralyzing fear is brilliantly portrayed throughout the novel. Child 44 won the ITW 2009 Thriller Award for Best First Novel, The Strand Magazine 2008 Critics Award for Best First Novel, the CWA Ian Fleming Steel Dagger Award, and was longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. This is the best book I have read in a long time.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I've watched the DVD over and over and still look forward to seeing and hearing it again and again. One of the top entertainment performances I have ever had the pleasure to experience. Great artist, great band, great production. Thanks JB and Thank you Amazon for delivering a quality product.

I am a repeat customer to Amazon and the pricing, product quality and customer service is why I plan to continue to come to this site to shop and buy!
B001OGLRRO|4.0|Somehow this diluted mixture of surf guitar, squeals, squeaks, screams, simple keyboard lines and absurdist lyrics comes together into a coherent and danceable masterpiece without ever devolving into mushy cheese. The shocking contrast between Fred Schneider's staccato barking and the lush gorgeous harmonies of Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson meld into an almost indescribable and unique sonic experience. They sing and play as if punk wasn't happening. They sound retroactively futuristic. Nothing else sounds, or looks, like the B-52s.<br /><br />This album set the stage for many follow-ups, but this one has a slightly more sparse early 60's guitar band feeling. Those raised on \\"Love Shack\\" may find the arrangements and vocal histrionics here bizarre and empty at first. But just wait. Do some of the sounds on \\"Rock Lobster\\" actually come from human beings? Well, yes. Did he really squawk \\"bikini whale?\\" Well, yes. Am I really dancing like a caffeine pumped squirrel to this? Well, very much so, yes, you are. Wait! Did Henry Mancini get a writing credit for \\"Planet Claire?\\" Yes, he did. Don't worry. All's good. The B-52s manage to avoid clich&eacute;s to such a degree, even when borrowing melodies, that this spasmodically happy absurd dance music completely avoids shallowness. It even comes off as quirkily intellectual in places. Watch those brains dance. Squish squish.<br /><br />The B-52s also show, and continued to show, that labels and musical categories remain somewhat flabby generalizations. No band should have really sounded like this in 1979. Are they \\"happy punk\\" or \\"esoteric new wave?\\" It doesn't matter a bit of squat with infectious songs such as \\"52 Girls,\\" \\"Dance This Mess Around,\\" \\"Lava,\\" and pretty much everything included here flying at ears unprepared for such giddy heights of sound wave trampolining. Try not singing along to \\"This is the space age\\" or \\"6060-842 and I'm waiting for you.\\" Something purely genuine emerged from this extemporaneously organized group - their first session apparently involved a tropical Flaming Volcano drink. And though they continued to sound great they never again sounded quite as spontaneous or raw as on this album. Regardless, they still sound a bajillion times more spontaneous than the vast majority of dance/rock/pop bands. And they didn't stop here. And no one else should, either. This was merely the beginning of the irresistible B-52s vortex of happy noise.ion apparently involved a tropical Flaming Volcano drink.

B0050PYNO4|4.0|Two British comic book/science fiction fans Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) travel to America and join the famous pop culture convention Comic-Con International in San Diego. They have a great time there, but Graeme and Clive are in for a much bigger surprise. On the deserted road the two travelers encounters a car accident - and a fugitive space alien. And his name is Paul.  After \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and \\"Hot Fuzz,\\" Simon Pegg and Nick Frost team up once again, with Seth Rogen providing the voice of the titular wisecracking alien stranded on Earth. While \\"Paul\\" pokes fun at the sci-fi genre (with two bumbling \\"men in black\\" characters and other numerous pop culture references as well as several amusing cameos), the film, it is obvious, has a religious subtext that I think is unnecessary. In fact, you might say \\"Paul\\" is a road movie, a buddy movie, or something else. Likable and amusing as it is, perhaps \\"Paul\\" could have been better with a more focused storyline.  This is not to say \\"Paul\\" disappointed me. On the contrary I enjoyed the film and its goofy jokes, well, most of them. (Sorry, but I'm not much of a Seth Rogen fan.) \\"Paul\\" is not the best of Simon Pegg / Nick Frost movies, but is still enjoyable.
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Looks great on the Kindle Fire and the selection of differences so far as I am only 35 of 125 complete are smart and greatly chosen! Great education tool for kids and highly recommend it for young toddlers/kids 2yrs to 5.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is a pretty good app, works well on the kindle fire. It most definitely has plenty of games to play.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I started tuning in to Foster the People from that car commercial over the late summer of 2011. That followed with checking the band on YouTube and their various media spots.  Great listening and reminds me of summer roadtrips and concerts.  In some way, Foster the People are akin to the New Radicals \\"Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too\\" from a decade+ ago - at least only in some songs.  I've been listening to both on my various playlists.  Looking forward to seeing them live in 2012 and future productions.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this is a great tool to help kids learn how to think other than black and white.  The kids giving this one star are upset because its too hard for them.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I had this rated a 3 star as they did not include the radar maps. Now they have updated it and it is the same great app I have on my other devices. Thanks Weather Channel for the great Kindle Fire app!<br /><br />****************************************<br /><br />My original review:<br /><br />I use The Weather Channel Apps on my iPhone and iPad, HP Touchpad and Computer. It is a very good app and my favorite feature is the Radar Map with pin in the map where I am at. Seeing the weather come in I can plan my day for doing yard work, shopping or when to prepare for severe weather. This version for the Kindle Fire does not feature the radar map at all?<br /><br />I am shocked how The Weather Channel can leave out a major benefit and feature in such an important app. I see no reason to include tabs for Social Media or Videos and not include a Radar Map! This is The Weather Channel after all! I am sorry but I gave a 3 Star review for the temperature, weather and weather alert data. This could have been a 4 or 5 Star app but they just missed the boat! Please include the most important feature of your app and if you need room get rid of some of the other frivolous tabs just remember, I already have You Tube, Facebook and Twitter, I don't need you to copy the same data again!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire is fun to play and has really great features. As others have mentioned, the advertisements are a bit annoying but the gameplay is 5 stars all the way.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|This is a great game for young children that will help improve their ability to select what is different in each group of objects. The game has 125 sets of objects and one of the four objects shown does not fit in with the other 3. It could be the color, use, shape or anything you could think of. The child has to learn to be observant and select the object the does not fit into the group.<br /><br />After every 5 sets the game plays a small musical piece and flowers fall out of the sky to celebrate the success that they had in picking the right choices. There is a hint button on top of the screen that is a light bulb with a circle around it. By touching the light the game will provide the critical information that you have to consider in selecting the object that does not fit into the group, like color or shape.<br /><br />Hints are available in five languages and the game is fun for children as it is colorful, musical and makes them think. The game is targeted for children 3 and up in age. Teach your children colors, shapes, categories, animal's names and interact with them as they play. It is a good learning experience!

B004EF6632|5.0|North and South is a wonderful adaptation of the book.  The acting and scenery are perfect!  However, this online streaming version cuts out a few minutes.  So you need to watch or buy the actual DVD to see a few more worthwhile minutes of the story.  I love North and South; it is truly one of my favorite movies!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I won't go into long descriptions as others have.  Just to say it was a very touching book that helps one understand how people become who they become.  If you knew from where they came, you could understand.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|I've had the 802 for a couple of years now and have had no major issues with it. The sound is great (I only ever hear noise if I crank a channel most of the way up, which I never do in normal operation), all the knobs and inputs work fine...the little blue LED will just about blind you though lol. I recommend this mixer to other people in my situation (working by yourself or with one or two others). I run the output RCAs into a Lexicon Omega interface (also worth picking up IMO) and record with Audacity (free audio editor...I'm hoping to eventually upgrade to Ableton Live though). With a power amp and speakers you could probably do small gigs with it as well.
1451627289|5.0|Forget what you THINK you know about Stephen King - just buy the book.  It's gripping and clever but has real emotional depth and warmth.  But be warned: once in the grip of the book, real life takes second place.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|This game has no business being apart of the free app for the day. such a waste for a free app for working professionals.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|PROS: Ergonomics are great, keymapping is easy to use, don't have to move with WASD.<br /><br />CONS: A bit of a pain to have extra stuff on your desk. Instead of using a raised nub to help center your fingers they use indented keys so until I got used to it I'd misplace my fingers.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Grabbed this after playing the SWTOR beta; it had been a long time since I'd played any PC game that had used the \\"WASD\\" setup. Plus I played in the dark so I was having issues seeing keys etc.<br /><br />Mapped the directions to the thumb joystick and ctrl & alt to the buttons near that. I had been concerned I'd get tired using my thumb to move, but it feels so much more natural to use the thumb to move and having the actions under my fingers.<br /><br />Lastly, the screen can be used for a ton of stuff, my use is a bit more mundane. I always have issues staying up too late to play so I just set it to show the clock and I'm good.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|this is a great game for your preschooler or kindergartener, mine both loved it.  the game was even better seeing that it was even free today!
0765316897|5.0|A lot of times the journey in epic fantasy is better than the destination. That is to say that a lot of times the endings to Epic Fantasy hardly ever lives up to the promise of the rest of the series. This isn't true with this series. The author Brandon Sanderson has stated in interviews that he had written the ruff drafts of all three books before they were published. You can tell this whole series feels very together and focused.<br /><br />I love how the author plays with typical fantasy beats but never giving into tired storytelling cliches. The world building and characters are what make this series so specia<br /><br />This third book has a lot of story to tell in before it is over. Sanderson is a master at weaving all the plots together and making them come full circle.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Really you have not heard video-game sounds until you have listened to these. It's like Dr. Dre's beats for the xbox! Easy setup, excellent sound, and great balance between your right ear, and your left ear. I can even hear the dust settling in \\"Dome\\" on MW3. It also gives a small, but awesome advantage by enabling for you to hear people \\"sneaking up\\" behind you in any FPS I know. If you gave this 1 or 2 stars, it's probably either that you have installed it incorrectly, or have a hearing disability (not to be offensive in any terms).
0765356139|5.0|Book two of Mistborn delivers a rich and compelling narrative. The first book was so good and self contained I was a little scared to go any further. I am glad that I did! This second book has a beginning a middle and an end. Meaning that this book can be read on its own. The plot cames to a very satisfying conclusion. That is not to say that everything is done. You can see that there is more story to tell. What this book does is it escapes a lot of the pitfalls that epic fantasy gets itself into by always going along without ever feeling like your getting any where.<br /><br />So wrapping up if you liked the first one this one will win you over as well. If you are trying to decide if this series is right for you and your checking on reviews of later books to find out then let me put you at ease. This is grand storytelling. A series like no other.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I fall asleep every night now to the rain on a tent roof. I also love the Icon! this is one I will always use daily.
0765365278|5.0|Lets get right to it. If you read that this is the first of ten books and you get excited then order it right now! If you are put off by it then I would say that this isn't for you. Sanderson is writing for people like me that love the Wheel of Time series and are willing to invest over a decade to see how it all comes out.<br /><br />To discuss this book you have to compare it to the Wheel of Time. What also needs to be said is that even though I love the WoT series this first book The Way of Kings is better than any book by Robert Jordan. Sanderson has said in interviews that this book can be written because he has seen decades of fantasy being written and knows what works and what doesn't. Charaters are very very well done. Kaladin on down are some of my favorite I have read.<br /><br />You can tell from the artwork down to the way the book is designed that this was a labor of love for the author and the folks at Tor. They knew what I just found out. That this book rocks and needs to be read.<br /><br />P.S. Journey before Destination!
0525478817|5.0|When I first received The Fault in Our Stars, I was almost scared to begin reading it. I was worried that, after loving John Green's previous books, I would end up disliking this one, and have to lie and say I liked it so I wouldn't disappoint all my other John Green-loving friends. However, The Fault in our Stars is an absolute triumph. I have only cried at two books in my life: Looking for Alaska and now TFioS. The book has moments of beautiful humor (Issac may be my favorite supporting character ever) and heartbreaking honesty (If Hazel's first monologue about the uselessnes of worrying about oblivion doesn't kick you right where it hurts, you probably don't have a pulse) and I felt like I was on a roller coaster of emotion. I don't want to say too much about the book, because I feel like spoilers would have killed it for me. But this book is a must-read. Bravo, John Green. And thank you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it. best game app ever. so many games. so little time. lovelovelove I love it. absolutely amazing. I hope for more games
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I found this app to be for really young kids like 4 and under. Its a guessing game they show 4 pictures one doesn't match the catagory like, a comb, a toothbrush, a mirror, and a tiger abosously the tiger is wrong its objects.found in the bathroom. So I give it a 3 only because its the free app of the day.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Tale of an underachieving writer type whose life begins to unravel which leads him to try out an illegal drug called NCT that basically takes you to 100% of your true brain capacity and catapults the main character's meteoric rise to success. He finishes his novel in but a few days and proceeds to make stock investments to take care of his money problem and of course win back the girlfriend who left him at his low moment of self sabotage. The drug has some side effects which black him out and make him not so successful and sort of explain some of the plot holes but not all of them. Of course, the problem with having a story like this in which you take a pill that puts you at 100% brain capacity is that there are so many possibilities that some segment of the movie audience is going to object to the actions of the main character. You're better off just going with the story. Based on the Alan Glynn 2001 novel DARK FIELDS. The budget was $27M and it made over $161M at the Box Office. Wowza. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; INTRIGUING IDEA: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid January 2012 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B plus.

B005KLAA4A|3.0|Please note: this is a review for the SHM-CD which is both a remaster AND the original mix.  Amazon has decided that all versions are the same (which isn't true) and has put this under the regular CD edition. This edition is distinct and different from the remaster using the original mixes AND including the bonus tracks from The remixed remastered edition.<br /><br />&#34;Face Dances&#34; got a raw deal. While it might have sounded like The Who were box stepping to rock music, the band was going through another transition with their new drummer and with Pete Townshend wanting to try a slightly different direction.<br /><br />With songs such as &#34;Just Another Tricky Day&#34; and &#34;You Better, You Bet&#34; (both of which got plenty of air play back in the day), the album pairs up well with Pete Townshend's [[ASIN:B000008LO6 All the Best Cowboys Have Chinese Eyes]].<br /><br />When Jon Astley remixed The Who catalog he got a mixed reaction from fans; it was like messing with the Mona Lisa for a lot of fans and sometimes these remixes were missing overdubs. This SHM-CD (SHM uses a special polycarbonate plastic. SHM-CDs feature improved transparency on the data side of the disc, allowing for more accurate reading of CD data by the CD player laser head.<br /><br />SHM-CD format CDs are fully compatible with standard CD players. Now, some people believe that SHM makes a big difference and some do not regardless of which boat you fall into what makes this set essential are the original mixes plus the bonus tracks(the original CD issue also used the original mixes).<br /><br />There are some problems here though--there's some noticeable clicks that occur on &#34;Don't Let Go The Coat&#34; which, given the price of this remaster, is rather sad and inexcusable. Still, the mastering for many other tracks here is terrific so the shortcomings of this release are rather upsetting given all the work that went into this set.<br /><br />We also get vintage (where possible)mixes for the bonus tracks included here--<br /><br />  10  I Like Nightmares 3:09<br />  11  It's in You  4:59<br />  12  Somebody Saved Me 5:31<br />  13  How Can You Do It Alone 5:24  (Live)<br />  14  The Quiet One  4:28.(Lve)<br /><br />The digital glitch in &#34;It's In You&#34; that was on the remixed album has been fixed here.<br /><br />While the Astley remixes did give some added clarity they did so at the expense of the power of the album. The original mixes (or at least as mastered here by Astley)has stronger bass and drums throughout the album.<br /><br />The packaging replicates the original vinyl packaging but also includes a card that has a picture of the original label along with the number for this limited edition as well as a booklet with the lyrics and an Obi that replicates the Obi that was seen with the original Japanese vinyl edition of the album.<br /><br />Although flawed &#34;Face Dances&#34; has a number of strong songs on it and Kenny Jones does an admirable job on the drum stool. The original mixes trump the remixes to my ears it's a pity they couldn't get the remaster perfect i.e., the &#34;clicks&#34; that you can hear periodically on this remaster.<br /><br />If you want a better price order from CDJapan or amazon from overseas as you'll get a better price.<br /><br />Recommended.br />  11  It's in You  4:59<br />  12  Somebody Saved Me 5:31<br />  13  How Can You Do It Alone 5:24  (Live)<br />  14  The Quiet One  4:28.(Lve)<br /><br />The digital glitch in \\"It's In You\\" that was on the remixed album has been fixed here.<br /><br />While the Astley remixes did give some added clarity they did so at the expense of the power of the album.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a nice app. I just can figure out the wishing game . I don't know if I'm doing it wrong.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|what's up with the kiddies games lately? takes like five minutes. start puting up other games and I'll be happy.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|This cover is perfect.  The quality is excellent and believe me, I have checked out every case out there. It works better as a stand than those cases that have built in stands. I have seen in stores that this style comes in different sizes so just make sure you buy the one made for the Kindle Fire.  I wish it was less expensive but I am still glad I chose this case.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|I can not endorse this app do to the fact that it caused Superman75's lady friend to up and leave him.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Recommend it.A must have. A fun and addicting game you cant walk away from. lots of pretty cool games.love it
B006GG1KOC|4.0|Some puzzles are less obvious, wish it has a button that explains what makes the object different than the rest. Great game, overall.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works great on the Fire. It runs very fast on my fire. It does stay running though but you can force stop in your setting and it will reopen without a hitch. This is a must if you travel,you just put a zip code in and your off.and you can have muti location.It even had my VERY small town my father lives. Love it!
B002ZG97RE|3.0|One of the reasons I bought a Pioneer Plasma TV ,KRP-500A ,was that it produced the best blacks possible by any TV at that time(2010).This blu ray however made the tv's best feature useless as I could see grain,noise,snow or whatever you may care to call it in the dark scenes.And this movie has quite a number of dark scenes with lots of action.What's the point? It seems that grain is necessary or even desirable to some people and even the critics(Blu Ray.com) like it.  Personally ,a movie has to be clear and sharp, night scenes natural.Otherwise I will have to ask the question; why blu ray?
B004SBS8LA|2.0|What is all the hype?????? This is OK but I think it is way opver-hyped. The game play is smooth but the graphics just get \\"cute\\" to the max so much it gets tiring.
0743289692|5.0|Hirsi Ali is a voice much needed today to paint the reality of the Islamist world. She was there.  She lived it. And despite the threat of death she opened a door that has been long shut. Her life is not the brutal exception, but the ordinary life of an Islamist female. No one can doubt that she loved her family despite the abuse she endured. She wanted it all to work out...she wanted to believe...she wanted to respect what she had been taught. The problem was that all doors to information and knowledge are bolted shut within the Muslim world, imprisoning its adherents in the perspective of the seventh century, of radical and violent clan fanaticism and the inhuman suppression of women. Mohammed spread his doctrine with the tip of his sword. And today it is impossible for the majority of Muslims to think freely, to be exposed to other perspectives, to examine the merits and possible solutions to their cultural dilemna. Should someone stray and possibly even convert...they will pay with their lives.  I think Hirsi Ali's book provides a service to us in the West: it exposes the naivete and dangers of our political correctness, of our experiments with multiculturalism. It has been vogue in our universities to paint the Muslim religion romanically with pretty colors--and yes, there are uplifting passages in the Koran--and Muslims in this country enjoy our liberties, scarcely able to conceive of or guess how differently Wahhabism is lived in Arab countries. Hirsi Ali tells it like it is.  It is sad that Hirsi Ali has chosen the path of the athiest for now.  It is understandable that she is gun shy of a God, who by the name of Allah, caused her so much affliction, and by extension all her other sisters in that faith. But there is another understanding of God, a God of Peace and Love, and despite the disservice we sometimes do that God in our faulty human ways, He is the Father whom Ayan has always longed for and the mother whose hand caresses: He is!    by the author of 'Graffiti On My Soul', a mystical memoir of horror and forgiveness.

0374275637|5.0|I'm still reading the book, but it looks good so far. Its simple to understand with clear points. You don't need a psychological background to understand it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I agree with what some others have said - this is by far John Green's best work to date, and that's saying something.<br />I read this in one sitting, was up half the night and went through a half a box of tissues. You WILL cry. And not just because this is a book about teenagers with cancer (it is) and not because John Green uses emotionally manipulative author tricks to pull the cry out of you (he doesn't - thank you John - 'cause I hate books that do that). You will cry because of the masterful way that John Green weaves a story full of love. You won't just cry when people get sick or when they talk about death (you will). But you'll maybe cry during tender parts where the love between Hazel and Augustus (Gus) is so real and so huge and so beautiful that you are filled with such appreciation for it that all you can do is cry. And you'll cry because Hazel understands the suffering of her parents and the love her small family has for each other.<br />But you won't just cry. You'll laugh too, sometimes maybe even out loud. John is his usual super-smart witty self and the repartee between Hazel and Gus is funny, sometimes wicked and darkly funny. And then you throw Isaac into the mix and the three-way conversation is delicious.<br />Many loved Green's Looking for Alaska. I did not love that book. I liked it fine, but honestly I felt that it tried too hard and was pretentious. That book made me a fan of John Green, but not a mega fan.<br />The Fault in Our Stars tackles some of the same issues as Looking for Alaska but with so much more maturity and grace, that I can hardly believe it is by the same writer (except that it most certainly is - Green's unique voice is here and is certainly familiar to Green fans). But Green has had time to mature, both as a writer and a person, and I don't think you could ask for better treatment of such a tough and emotional subject as Green's tender hand in The Fault in Our Stars.<br />Given that the book deals with death, and the inevitability that one feels from the start that a death will happen (it is a book about cancer after all), the book appropriately discusses the big questions: Is there a God? Is there more to us than just our bodies? I got the sense that John Green argued this theme with himself by way of three characters: Hazel, Gus and a cynical author Peter Van Houten. There's little to no attempt here on the part of the author to tell us what to think or provide some grand answer (though perhaps through Hazel's father's simple yet profound statements on the topic we get as close as we can to an answer). And to address a topic like this and not provide grand statements and \\"answers\\" takes a hand of restraint on the part of an author. I think this hand of restraint can only be exercised by an experienced author at the top of his game.<br />My only fault with the whole book is that Hazel does not sound like a 16 year old girl - she sounds like John Green pretending to be a 16 year old girl. But just a few pages in, you'll forget that she sounds like John Green because you're so invested in her and Gus and the other characters that you'll forgive this one little fault.<br />If I could give more than five stars I would. This is a knock out of the park homerun of a book.<br />Thank you John Green for writing it.one feels from the start that a death will happen (it is a book about cancer after all), the book appropriately discusses the big questions: Is there a God?

B000RIWAVW|4.0|John Carpenter's Halloween is a slasher film that does an impressively good job of creating a tense atmosphere. It is a simple film, but really knows how to ramp up the feeling of dread. The DVD is rather bare bones, but for the price you really can't complain about this if you're a genre fan.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Free doesn't always mean good, this game is boring, plus I couldn't find how to play the instructions on the version I downloaded.<br />The sounds gave me a small headache after trying the game for awhile,had to mute the sound to keep trying to figure out the game
B0006A9FKA|4.0|\\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is a fun, amusing take on the zombie film. When the zombie apocolypse comes, clueless Shaun and his loser buddy must try to save Shaun's mother and ex-girlfriend with an ill-concieved plot to wait it all out at the local pub. Hillarity ensues. There is interesting social commentary as well. One word of advice: it is British comedy, and as such may not appeal to everyone. But overall a fun adventure that's worth a check out for a few laughs.

1601251505|4.0|I've been playing 4E D&D for three years now (and still have a couple of ongoing campaigns) and just picked this book up. You have to love the price after you consider that you get the original core races of AD&D and core classes (plus a couple) all in one book. Add to that the fact that you get all the GM stuff you'll need and it becomes even more pleasing. For really old school D&D fans like me, many of the things I loved from 1E and 2E are still present. This book clears up largely all of my issues with 3.5... largely but not all. I'd still say the combat rules and skill acquisition in 4E save a lot of time and still manage to cover all bases better, but for those who prefer a more pen and paper style of the world's oldest RPG, give Pathfinder a look. I love the fact that I would only need to spend around $90 on this book and the Bestiary to play and can save my other gaming funds for maps, minis, adventures, and other fun things, not too mention that I needn't worry about the book being out of date due to errata. And let me throw in the sheer pleasure of Wayne Reynolds artwork. Great job Paizo!<br /><br />Just wanted to add another note... While the hardcover binding is high quality, as is the design for this book, the page quality itself is somewhat flimsy. A page already developed a tear and had to be taped. The page quality in the 4E D&D books is much higher and none of my books have any ripped pages even after four years. That being said, I wouldn't let it be a deterrent from buying any future Pathfinder books. I would just make sure to be extra careful.

B002BWP49C|1.0|Ever since I read the epic disaster that was \\"Breaking Dawn,\\" I have been eagerly anticipating this movie. It was one of the vilest, silliest, grossest books I've ever read in my life, and I assumed that the movie would at least be funny. I mean, there's a scene where Edward chews open Bella's uterus!<br /><br />Well, \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I\\" managed to disappoint me. While there are some jaw-droppingly stupid moments, most of the movie is simply droningly dull -- there's more padding than actual story here, riddled with painfully awkward acting, monotonous sex scenes, and lots of important topics (like abortion) that the writers aren't NEARLY smart enough to address.<br /><br />Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) are finally getting married... and we get to see every single step of it. Everything. We see hairstyling, shoes, invitations, furniture arrangement, awkward toasts and the newlyweds making out at the altar (classy!). Oh, and Jacob (Taylor Lautner) freaks out when he discovers that Bella plans to actually (gasp!) have sex with Edward on their honeymoon.<br /><br />So they finally have melodramatic sex... only for Bella to get lightly bruised, which upsets Edward so much that he refuses to have sex with Bella again... for about a day.<br /><br />But then, Bella unexpectedly gets pregnant (wow, sex leads to pregnancy! WHAT A TWIST!). Excepting Rosalie, the Cullens all want her to abort the baby, but Bella refuses to do so even though it's killing her. This threatens to spark off another battle between the werewolves and vampires, because Bella is the center of the universe.<br /><br />The worst thing about this dreadful movie is that they broke the ludicrous \\"Breaking Dawn\\" story into two separate movies. This works when you have an epic story (\\"The Hobbit\\") or a plot-heavy one (\\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\"). But for a tween-porn romance about how special Bella is for having a functioning uterus, it's the kiss of death.<br /><br />So to fill out all the space NOT occupied by plot or characterization, the movie is crammed with padding. Lots of padding. Endless padding. We're forced to watch Bella shaving her legs, lounging around the house, and listening to hideously unfunny wedding toasts (except for Charlie's). Even the SEX feels like it has been padded -- I spent most of the PG-13 sex scenes wondering if Bella would ever change expression during sex (and no, she didn't).<br /><br />But the movie REALLY jumps the rails when Bella gets knocked up with her demonspawn. Suddenly we're assaulted with hellish birth scenes, sexual fantasies about a newborn baby, and ghastly CGI wolves. And whenever those CGI wolves are onscreen, the mood jumps from \\"stoned\\" to \\"hilariously hammy\\" (\\"I AM THE GRANDSON OF THE CHIEF!\\").<br /><br />Oh yes, and there are massive plot holes that render most of the plot pointless. For instance, the Cullens whine at Bella to have an abortion or she'll die. At that point, she appears to be at least 8 months along. WHY DOESN'T CARLISLE GIVE HER A C-SECTION?<br /><br />The acting is pretty much what you would expect. Kristen Stewart seems grossed out by even pretending to have sex with a man, and Bella is her usual graceless, mumbly, whiny, mouth-breathing self. She spends most of the movie either LITERALLY begging Edward for sex or cuddling up next to Jacob.<br /><br />And Edward shows just how abusive and obnoxious he can be, INFORMING Bella that she's going to get an abortion and emotionally blackmailing her when she won't.  As for Jacob... well, kiss any likable qualities in this character goodbye. After ranting about the evils of imprinting, he becomes a brainwashed pedophile engaged to a baby. And everyone is okay with this.<br /><br />I at least expected \\"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part I\\" to be horrible in a MST3K way, but sadly it just ends up a slow, dull grind riddled with gaping plot holes. Expect Part II to be doubly bad.ed by plot or characterization, the movie is crammed with padding. Lots of padding. Endless padding.

B005V1WZ10|3.0|What happend to KoRn?.KoRn is my favorite band for a long time now but this album does nothing good for KoRn yes it's something new but it's nowere near as good as the old KoRn.if you didnt notice dudstep sounds all the same it just a bunch of noises that sounds the same.i dont know why the bass player fieldy is on this album be cause you can not hear it at all i love hearing fieldy slaping the bass but you won't get that here.The guitar player James Munky Shaffer is also on here for no reason.This should have been Jonathan Davis solo album instead.it got some good song's like Get up! and Narcissistic Cannibal and Burn The Obedient.This album is just to short and the dudstep just killed this cd so just stick to old albums like life is peachy and issues and take a look in the mirror.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I got this for christmas and used it for a few weeks.  Overall it works decent, sound is good. It has some problems, such as randomly cutting out. It seems like it is trying to re-sync when it cuts out.<br /><br />After about 2 week it stopped working and will no longer turn on, with or without the usb cord.  Logitech support was worthless and ended up saying this is a hardware issue.<br /><br />UPDATED:  I did eventually get a replacement from Logitech.  I have not run into the power problem again, the only persistent issue I have with these is they will sometimes change channels a lot. 1-2 times a day at least the sound will cut out for 5 seconds while they pick a different channel.<br /><br />I have tried different locations for the reciever etc, but nothing seems to help. That is really my only major complaint with these.

0811876373|5.0|This book has so many adorable designs for any type of celebration/party.  I made the \\"apple\\" shaped cake pops for a retirement party and received so many compliments.  Cake pops are time consuming to make, but the final results are amazing and worth the time and effort.  The book has detailed instructions, plus color photos of the final cake pops.  They also show step by step with photo pictures of how to make basic cake pops and also quick tips to fix any issue.  I highly recommend this book.  It is even better now, as it is spiral bound.  You will love it.

I received another cover (M-EDGE, from another company)as a Christmas present. I did like that it opened like a book and my Fire could be propped to watch videos. However, there was no closure to keep the cover in place and after inspecting it, realized that one of the speakers was covered.  So I ordered Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware from Amazon. It fits the Fire perfectly, all buttons, speakers and ports are accessible, and the bezel is not covered. It is very light weight, props fine and the best part-the elastic band holds the cover closed.  If you are looking for a cover, buy it from Amazon-they fit.
B0064J6OMO|1.0|My fiancee and I had heard good reviews of this movie and rented it through Amazon's streaming.    Well, we couldn't stomach it much beyond the opening credits.  Bathroom humor, if it was ever actually funny, ceased to be entertaining long, long ago.  Maybe it has some good points but it is just so offensive in the beginning that, well, why bother?  There are so many good movies out there; don't waste money on this one.  Even when they will have it on the free list it will not be worth the price.
B005V2EVBQ|1.0|Received the Kindle Fire for Christmas.  I wanted a cover for the screen and the ability to prop up the Kindle Fire for watching movies while making cross country flights.    PROS: I found the Kindle snapped right into the case and the case itself fits almost like a glove around the Kindle Fire.  The screen cover lid has a soft material on the screen side that minimizes harm to the screen (such as scratches). There is an elastic strap on the back side of the case.  Very light weight. If all you are looking for is a good solid case that protects your Kindle, this case may very well work for you.    CONS: The screen cover lid also doubles as an easel for propping up the Kindle Fire.  The cover lid folds back and into a indented area on the backside to hold up the Kindle.  Unfortunately, the indented area is not deep enough to maintain a solid support of the Kindle. If there is movement of the Kindle, either from bumping or vibration, it has a tendency to fall flat.  Also, the instructions didn't explain how the elastic strap is to be used, but I assume it is an extra to allow you to wrap it around a clip board or some other support.    Not sure I would buy this product had I known that there would be difficulty in maintaining a solid easel position, as that was the primary purpose in buying it.  As a cover and protector, it is fine.  For the price, I would consider another product if you are looking for cover protector that also functions as an easel. It is a bit overpriced at $29.99.
B005K2Z5IA|5.0|If you don't want a cover, but want to protect your Kindle this is a really great one.  Quality product.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the reading plans and being able to pick which version I want to read!! thanks for a great app!
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|App simply spins on the kindle. Gets a constant loading error. needs an update before useful. needed three more words to submit review...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played on this device this is also the only game.I ever play
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love the concept of mini-games. Kids have a short attention span and this would keep them busy for a while.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Works exactly as it said. I'm also getting surround sound when I play my xbox 360! No hassle, easy to use, intuitive plug and play.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I am very pleased with this processor.  I never even over clocked it, and I had it converting media formats, installing programs, and running a spybot scan with no slowdown as soon as I opened it.  I purchased this for my first computer build.  I was a little nervous at first, but installing it into the MOBO was a breeze.  The price dropped while I was waiting for my order to be shipped, and Amazon adjusted the order for me since it hadn't been shipped yet.  Thank you Amazon for the great customer service.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Love this movie, had to watch it twice.  I love baseball movies and this one will go down as one of my top five favorites.  Brad Pitt puts on a great performance.  Its been over one year since I purchased a DVD and after watching the movie on Amazon instant viewer for $3.99 I purchased the DVD movie afterwards to add to my collection.    After watching the movie I have decided to give my Cubs another chance during the rebuilding process and give Theo Epstein and company some time to piece a good team together.    Also Michael Lewis knows how to put together a story.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game for everyone. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. I love this.
B0068AWQQ2|2.0|Very silly and forgetful movie.  Waste off time and I'm surprised an established actor such as Colin Farrell took this role.  I say avoid and don't waste your time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|At first, I only bought this game because it was free, turns out its fun! Some games are better than others, but still lots of fun! When I'm babysitting I can just hand my kindle to them and they are entertained!
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Without going into a re-telling of the entire plot line, I have to say this is one of the best books I've read in the last two years.  Having never heard of the author before, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and bought the second in the series, FREEDOM, just as soon as I finished Daemon.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|like this gives me a challenge and something to work towards.  very awesome.  the game have achievements they are within reason to get to.
0525478817|5.0|I have been literally waiting (correct use of literally)for this book for half a year.  I can't help but say those trite words, \\"It made me laugh.  It made me cry.\\"  There was alot of crying and even more laughing, but the crying was completely heart-wrenching.  There was a bit of time that I was not sure that I would be able to finish the book over a single line that was just too hard for me to read. I have never felt that strongly about a sentence in my life.  Now, I have to say that I have a special bond with the subject matter because I am the mother of a cancer survivor. He is 13, almost 14 and has been NEC (No evidence of cancer) for a very long time. But the fear never goes away.  It lives in a part of your mind that you try not to notice.   I cannot say what the sentence was, because it would be a spoiler and above all I want people reading this review to read the book.  So no spoilers, but the sentence is at the top of page 112 and it was said by Hazel's mom.   So, please read this book.  It is not only good, but important.  It is hard to find books that are both these days.  The subject matter is true, engaging and terrifying...it will make you laugh, but it will also make you cry. DFTBA
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This case cover is by far the most professional looking and versatile cover I have ever purchased.  It is so sturdy, I have no fear of any accidental damge to my Kindle Fire outside of water.  I highly recommend this product.  P A. Bennett PHD.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great daily app. good for travel too. I use it to plan.road trips, and see what the weather is where my daughter lives.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My son and I enjoy playing the games on this app!!!  This is my favorite app to play any time of day!!!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Good twist to the cowboys and indians genre.  Plenty of action.  Makes you think.  Good for those who feel all things are possible and takes you from action to science fiction.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|It was shipped in one day and factory sealed. Great condition, just what I asked for. I could not be happier with the service and hand written note
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The product arrived earlier than expected and in great condition.  Still in shrink wrap and played perfectly, with no scratches.
B005POK858|5.0|Kemco finally fixed the Moto sound crashing issue.  Now I love this game.  Kemco takes a while, but they stand by their products.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I received the Red Verso Case Cover with my Kindle Fire for Christmas and could not have been more pleased.  It is the perfect compliment to a wonderful Christmas present!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my brother, and he was very happy with it. It arrived promptly, and he really enjoyed the collection. He's a big Star Wars fan, and he felt this was a good collection.
B00003CX8N|5.0|Really well done....marvelous acting, and a great story. Would be especially appreciated by persons interested in literature, and anglophiles, as well!
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas, and he loved it. This is a great value for a fantastic set. Makes an excellent gift for an Oceans fan!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|this is amazing...It is so light in weight but sturdy....I love it..This is a wonderful product to purchase..I give it 5 stars
B005COO1X6|3.0|I thought this was a decent story. It was taut and suspenseful with a high creep factor.  As always, I fell in love with King's characters quickly. I especially loved the character of Rachel - she was spunky and brave while remaining believably six years old. King is skilled at portraying realistic characters of all ages. His kids feel like kids, not like an adult's stiff impression of kids. My only complaint is that I wish the story was longer - the ending felt a bit abrupt and wasn't altogether satisfying. That said, it was an enjoyable read and I would give it a solid 3.5/5.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not bad though some of the games are a bit simple it is something I would recommend if you need something to take il time because it can get addicting
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. makes it hard to quit after you start really easy to earn money to get more games unlocked
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a great way to pass time... what I really love is that if you are really close to finishing there is autocomplete to finish it up quickly. what is also great is since it exersises your brain (still fun) my mom wont get upset that I'm playing it so much. Great for all ages
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I ordered a DVD and was so impressed with the speedy delivery. I received the DVD just two days after ordering it and that was with standard delivery. The DVD was in excellent shape, we have viewed all disc and enjoyed them so much.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I got this app when it was offered for free, but would have no problem paying for it. Not only can you find out and learn the phases of the moon, but you can manipulate the it so you can see and light up the dark side of the moon. Great app!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle fire. It wa easy to figure out all the settings. good game
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoyed the game it worked very well. It kept my mind working at fairly high level, which is a good thing.
B002VKZNBS|5.0|This is one of the best children's books ever written, especially for children six and younger.  It is a wonderful lap book for reading with your child or grandchild.  Children are quickly able to join in the repeated line:  \\"But he was still hungry!\\"  It also is a great counting book.  I rate it as one of Eric Carle's best books!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Very addictive experience will have you rushing from one game to the next and sacrificing your sleep in the process. Definitely worth more than &quot;free,&quot; but if that is all they are asking, then so be it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app does have several games but none of them are entertaining. I played several of them before the review just to see the quality which isn't bad just not the best.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not rocket science, just a set of simple games. The sound gets in the way from time to time, overall a good set of games to have when you have absolutely nothing else to do.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|been playing on my kindle fire for about 30 min and its gone black twice... it would be ok if it saved my progress, but no, it doesn't.  bums me out. I love it, but....... fix the problem. PLEASE!!!!!
0439023521|5.0|I read this YA book after it was recommended by a friend who had read it for a book club.  I didn't expect to get so caught up in the story, ended up reading the entire trilogy.  This copy I bought for my daughter for Christmas because I knew she would love it, too, in spite of being 28 years old.  Very well written, great lessons, and hard to put down.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|I think that the free app service we're granted is great. Including apps for every market is a must and this looks like a great choice for people with young kids. Enjoy lil'ones!!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Still watching them - brilliant!!!!!  You can't beat the Bundys for comedy.  Would advise anyone who has never seen them and wants a good laugh to spend the time to watch them all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My son is so addicted to this game that his 7th birthday party was all Angry Birds! We have all of their games: Rio, Seasons, and So Easy (shows how to get 3 stars)
B001H9MYPW|5.0|This season (II) of \\"In Treatment\\" was as good as Season I, if not better. Gabriel and Diane Wiest are such fantastic actors, so believable in their shrink roles. I don't understand why there aren't more excellent tv series like this - they are captivating & you feel as if you are in the doc's room with each patient.  It's difficult not to watch each dvd at one sitting, so rivetting are the performers, but one has to do other things. I've started watching Season III, and was a little sad to see (so far) that Diane Wiest is no longer Gabriel's shrink, although she is mentioned in sessions I've watched to date. Gabriel B has a new female shrink, so I'm just getting used to her - she sure is on the ball though.  Greatest entertainment in my dvd library selection & I'd recommend it to anyone who wants quality dvd entertainment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great download for any old gamer that remembers the old games, fun time wasting and no real point lol. get this app!
B006GG1KOC|3.0|I played through all the boards in roughly 10 minutes. I found quite a few that didn't make sense. Example: water mellon, a carrot, a piece of cake, and a lollipop. I immediately guessed the water mellon because it didn't make any sense. Turns out the answer was the carrot... can't tell why though.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game and have gotten 3 stars on every level.  New levels seem to come out regularly and are unique to previous boxes
0062082353|5.0|Kyles book is outstanding, I finished it in two days (I couldn't put it down). I like how he opened up about his family life, often being a SEAL looks glamours (and it is) but not for the family left behind. I enjoyed reading Taya, his wife's POV and wish it had more of that in the book. However this was on his story and kill shots which were most definitely exciting to read. I highly recommend this book.
B006C1DH92|5.0|I really enjoyed this app. I got it on the day it was free, and I love it. it has a lot of features that fruit ninja doesn't, like the ' desperado' (survival) mode.  This is a great game with lovely graphics and I recommend that you get it. You won't be disappointed by this game!
B003Y5H54W|4.0|I really liked this movie. I bought it with really no expectations, but now after I've seen it I'm glad I bought it.
0062011847|1.0|Having previously praised the first book in this series '\\"Guards Guards\\" as one of the finest works of Literature produced in the 20th century - I am deeply saddened to see it deteriorate in to a Politically Correct pseudo leftist morality tale - better suited to an Affirmative Action Lecture by Fem-nzi Harpies than Discworld.  Perhaps the tragic loss of Basic Freedoms in England, including the prohibition on Free Speech that fails to pander; and the Constant Threat of the Kommisars of the Political Thought Police to Punish anyone who dares display \\"Ism-Obia\\" (politically un-good views, regardless of how factually correct) has Intimidated Pratchett and his publishers...   - Enough to water down the Piquant Swiftian Satire of a classic like 'Guards Guards' - to the mealy groveling to political correctness that has punctuated his last two puff pieces: 'Sniff' and 'Academical Homosexalists'.  Perhaps it is best they left out the 'wedding' scene with Nobby - formerly one of the finest characters ever to emerge from England - who is now reduced to a just another Knob.   After all, how much humor can you milk out of a wedding ceremony that consists of sharing a Cupcake (no candle / frosting, too dangerous), then carefully composting the paper cup, and then listening ever so attentively to a rousing lecture on the duty to prevent sexual harassment by the Hated Pigs of the Patriarchy? Or Patricians for that matter?  OR Maybeeee He Just Plain Ran Out of Gas...  All Samey Same Really - in the Sad Soggy Remains of Preacher Pratchett's Tears of Snot World.
B00000269J|4.0|a few songs on here are brilliant, which shows gilmours contribution to the band, but lacks waters, who just made it that much better with his less peaceful side, and he also provided a slight variation in vocalists, which i liked. not a bad album at all though
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good game but money runs out fast I really do not get the point of this whole twenty five word minimum its dumb anyways I like the game
