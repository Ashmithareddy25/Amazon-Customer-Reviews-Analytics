B00005JKCH|5.0|Ok well where do I start? Hmm. Okay well they went all out for this DVD. I love how they have the 2-disc set and on disc 2 they have the Green Goblin and I was thrilled as could be that they put my favoite super villian on a DVD disc. The gag outakes were funny and the picture on the movie was beautieful. I like how they added all the commercials and they even showed the HBO makeing of Spider-Man and the E! special. I recommend,no,I highly recommend this DVD. If you want the full package get the DVD not the tape. All around it is a good movie and good extras.
0743518136|4.0|I thought the enneagram would be the last time I tried to quantify personality.  These guys have done, to my mind, a better job because they aren't trying to explain so much.  The test makes a lot of sense to me, and the insights are helpful.  I also appreciate that their approach is understated.  These guys aren't telling you that with their system your life will finally fall into place.  They are just offering customized insights into your particular personality and offering basic strategic advice on how to maximize your potential.
B00005JKDR|5.0|...Not only was the movie great, but the fact that the DVD came as a set of two was even more facinating.  The first was the movie, lasting 1 hour and 33 minutes and the second was the bonus material, lasting almost 2 and 1/2 hours.  This second disc was full of bloopers, extra scenes that were cut out of the movie, commentaries by the director, and interviews with the voice actors.  There is also a wide range of games, a music video, a short film titled \\"Mike's New Car\\", which was pretty funny, another short film called \\"For The Birds\\" and the original story line of what the movie was going to be like.  In this disc they also have a tour of the Pixar Studio, the cast of characters, what it took to make Monstropolis look like a \\"monster city\\" instead of a \\"real city\\" and how they managed to put everything together to make this wonderful movie.  These are a wonderful attribute to the movie, because children can sit down a watch all of the work and fun that goes into making a movie that will become one of thier favourites.<br />I strongly recommend this movie to anyone.  It is great for both kids and adults alike.  It is filled with humor for both and it will be enjoyed by everyone.  I am a university student and I have bought this movie.  A lot of my friends love this movie, and almost everyone that I have talked to also love it.  It is \\"a get away from the everyday\\" movie that we are normally used to watching.  This may be made for children, but we all still have a bit of a child in us.  That is why this movie is so great.

6304539258|5.0|Their is no person I know that has not watched nor loved this movie.  This is the movie that took SCI-FI to a new level no other film could (including Star Trek's failures).  This movie introduced a generation a bunch of loveable charocters.  I love the love/hate relationship between Han and Leia.  Never have droids seemed so fun after seeing C3PO and R2D2.  Every person has a Luke Skywalker in them.  What I love about this movie and the theme of this film.....a simple farm boy such as Luke Skywalker in the end becomes a jedi knight.  Translation good message for kids you can be anything if you try!  This film should be in everybody's collection!

0060977493|5.0|It is not just the plot, which is enough to thrill.  Nor the way it is revealed -- deliciously in layers, like peeling a fruit. It is not just the thoughtful social commentary, or the way it educates readers about the rural life of India.  What makes this book a pure exquisite read is the language.  The poetry is beautiful.  The way opposing sentiments are juxtaposed in a single sentence is genius. I recommend reading this book more than once.  The first run merely to discover the plot.  The second and upteenth time to savor the language.<br />I do not recommend this book to those who enjoy their books fast and think John Grisham is a literal genius.
B00002EPJH|4.0|Many of these tunes are just beautiful.  Keith fills them with emotion and longing that strike a chord in your heart.  I'm thinking specifically of &quot;My Wild Irish Rose&quot;, &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot;, and the wonderful &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, which is the best rendition of the song I've ever heard.  It really defies description.  Having this album is like inviting Keith over for your own personal concert; it's warm and evocative.  Not perfect, but very good.<br />Recommended.
0375823360|4.0|ok, everyone. after reading a couple of reviews, i decided to write my own, but BEWARE, this one is detailed, because i want to say what i really think of pulman's piece of work. there are a few spoilers, so don't read if you haven't read the books. but do read if you have, because i have thought aot about this trilogy, and i think i have some good points about it. <BR>first of all, i am a devoted christian, and some of the themes in this trilogy did touch a string, but i have faith-which is believing when not seeing. And this was just fiction, although i do believe that pullman was trying to make a point, a very strong point in writing these books. and i don't think he necessarily wanted to turn people off from jesus. perhaps he was just voicing some of his own thoughts and doubts. and he was doing it SO WELL, in the first two books, he had SUCH great ideas, but i' afraid he failed to make good use of them. most of his sttory lines just hopelessly trailed off, like for example the idea about mary being the tempter, and building the magnificent spyglass (it does nothing, believe me).<br />second, the characters were sometimes very undeveloped, i found that especially with Will. Lyra was a great character, and pullman created a very convincing little girl. but will...i thought too much depended on his mother - like the strongest weapon in the world breaking because will loved his mother too much. father gomez - i think pullman was desperate in the end and used him to get rid of balthamos (my favourite character in the book - unfortunately gay)what the hell? but in general, characterisation wasn't too bad<br />thirdly, the plot. a bit too many ideas, phil. make no mistake, they were great, but the reader had to stop and re-read certain paragraphs in order to understand what the whole trilogy was  trying to say. and Dust? there was SO much to-do about it throught all three books, but we never understood why it clung to adults, or whether it was good or bad. once againi mention mary malone, a very strange and out of place character whose place in the story we didn't quite understand. also who is on whose side - we never understand.<br />a few really weak moments, like when God, the ultimate authority of all the universes dies in about 3 lines description. very weak. also there is only a couple of weeks between the second and third books, yet Will and Lyra SUDDENLY see the Spectres.<BR>not to mention the ending - emotionaly, but made no impact, you never felt any different, you never had the feeling of \\"yes, finished. \\" it was all just a mangle of feeling betwen Will and Lyra that never got preperly resolved. <br />But in general, like i say, Very Good Ideas, and i congratuale phillip on them. Maybe a bit better craftsmenship at writing would have made them perfect, but its not to be. <BR>i look forward to any other books by pullman.<br />p.s. read Juliet Marillier the Sevenwaters Trilogy. Those are defietely perfect books.
B000069CWE|1.0|This is really a poor finish to their previous cd. All the songs has been stripped of their heavy riffs and replaced by unacceptable things, metal bands are made off. If you like metal and listen to bands like Korn, System of a Down and even Linkin Park's new cd you will consider this cd alot of [junk]. Do not waste your money on this, buy Hybrid Theory. Hybrid Theroy is what a real metal album should be.
0425107469|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. Even though the Outsider was fundamentally evil, I still wanted things to work out for it. Watchers can make you see both sides of the story, it makes you realise that even though something may be a killer, it can still feel. No other book has ever made me feel so much pity for a creature so bloodthirsty. This book is truly one of a kind. Very highly recommended.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Female artists always say on their sophomore albums that they &quot;really grew up on this album. the music is much edgier and much more me&quot; but it always is the same recycled songs, and they only wrote 5 out of 12 songs. Well, Christina Aguilera actually did mature and her music actually is edgier and much more personal. The lyrics are very easy to relate to, and in many of the songs you get to know Christina, this album shows she is a very strong person and misunderstood in many cases. She's been through a lot in her life and she writes songs helping young girls, like me, to get through the things that everyone goes through, &quot;Young girl don't cry, I'll be right here when your world starts to fall.&quot; &quot;The Voice Within&quot; is my personal favorite. Don't let the first single, &quot;Dirrty&quot; let you think this album is all trashy, meaningless music because it is much more.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Forget the god awful \\"Dirrty\\" video and single and just listen to this album for what it really is- a bold step to maturity for Christina. I honestly say Christina did lose me as a fan with her new image these days but I gave \\"Stripped\\" a chance-and I love it.<br />Christina does venture into every genre imaginable including R&B with my FAVORITE track on this album \\"Walk Away\\", rock, pop, jass, and gospel.<br />The only two tracks that are sexual are \\"dirrty\\" and \\"get Mine, Get Yours\\" which I like better than \\"Dirrty\\". ..., if she wanted to be raunchy, she could have released this song and it probably could have faired better on the charts. <br />Standout tracks for me are: <BR>\\"Walk Away\\" This is the best ballad I have heard by Christina and is my FAVORITE. It's sounds so painful and heartbreaking. DEFINATELY SHOULD BE A SINGLE.<br />\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" a hip hopish tune about double standards. Very enjoyable. Lil Kim's verse in it could have been left on the cutting board because it is very boring. But definitely a good track.<br />Also \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Keep On Singing My Song\\", \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" and \\"I'm O.k.\\".<br />So before u write this album off, u should really give it a try.
B000067CQK|2.0|My five issues with the mastering on this edition of one of my favourite rock albums:<br />(1) Some tracks have rather muffled sound: &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; is just a tiny bit congested when compared with the old EMI disc, but &quot;Suffragette City&quot; is noticeably lacking in upper-end bite. There's more low-end on the new disc, so this may represent an intentional change in emphasis, but it still sounds odd to my ears: much of the snarl is missing from Ronno's chugging guitar riffs.<br />(2) The little tiny three-note guitar lick at the very end of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; -- the one *right* before &quot;Suffragette City&quot; crashes in -- has been faded out, so that the two songs no longer flow continuously one into the other. I can't imagine why this was done.<br />(3) The *really* puzzling one: the new disc has the stereo image REVERSED. Check out the opening of &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;: the new disc has the acoustic guitar in the left channel, when it's been on the right on every previous release. Similarly, the five little hits on the ride cymbal at the very start of &quot;Suffragette City&quot; should be in the right speaker: here, they're on the left. It's not a remix: they've just swapped the L and R channels.<br />(4) The very first piano note in &quot;Lady Stardust&quot; is missing its initial attack: it sounds as if the track was faded up from silence, and a little bit of the initial &quot;thunk&quot; was lost. It's quite noticeable when compared with the 1999 EMI disc.<br />(5) The &quot;one-two&quot; count-in at the start of &quot;Hang On To Yourself&quot; is gone. Not reduced in volume: it's *gone*. The song just starts off with the two-chord hook. As far as I'm aware, every previous release of the album has had the count-in.<br />I've no idea what could have prompted the mastering team (Peter Mew and Nigel Reeve, the same gents who did the 1999 EMI master) to make these bizarre alterations to this album. Until/unless EMI fixes these issues, I'm afraid I can't recommend this release: stick with the 1999 EMI disc for the best available version of _Ziggy Stardust_.<br />The packaging and bonus tracks rate 2 stars by themselves. But as a best-ever release of the album, I think this edition falls woefully short.es, I'm afraid I can't recommend this release: stick with the 1999 EMI disc for the best available version of _Ziggy Stardust_.<br />The packaging and bonus tracks rate 2 stars by themselves.

0316666343|3.0|While original in it's telling (how many books are narrated by dead people, after all?) and not badly written, The Lovely Bones feels very familiar, very predictable at times--scripted, you might say; and sometimes, it absolutely drags. The description of heaven--heavenS; everybody apparently has their own--and the unexplained interaction between the residents there and those on earth (and unexplained principles governing them) is all, to this reader, really annoying. Peppered through out the book are moments tender and graceful, when the narrator seems to glimpse truths and hold them to the light, like gems, and we get to join her in awe.  But these times seem compromised by the aforementioned, and keep this good book from being more than that: just a good book.
0385484518|5.0|Mitch Albom was a student of sociologist Morrie Schwartz at Brandeis University.  At graduation he promised to keep in touch with his old professor, but as time went on this promise faded away.  Nearly twenty years later Albom, now a sports writer, was flipping through the channels when he saw his old professor on \\"Nightline\\" and discovered how sick he actually was.  Morrie was suffering from ALS, or Lou Gerhig's disease, which slowly wastes away your muscles.  After seeing this show Mitch flew up to Boston to visit his dying teacher.  After their first reunion Mitch continued to visit every Tuesday afternoon.  They were \\"Tuesday people\\".<BR> <BR>Tuesdays with Morrie is a touching story that discusses the meaning of life.  It is a small book with a large message.    Though this story never actually tells the reader what the true meaning of life is, it does expand on the professor's sayings.  These include \\"Love is the only rational act\\", \\"Love each other or perish\\", \\"death ends a life, not a relationship\\".  <BR> <BR>Albom calls his weekly visits with Morrie their last class together and the theme \\"the meaning of life\\".  The topics of this class included life, death, marriage, money, family, and other such issues.  Though the author did bring a tape recorder to their classes he did not provide a full transcript of these discussions.  Instead he focused on those Morrie's little aphorisms.  He was able to tie just about everything to love.  To Morrie there is no life without love.  He looked down upon our culture saying that it taught all of the wrong values and trains us to hold in our emotions and feelings.  <BR> <BR>This book comes close to being almost too sentimental, but stops before it gets excessively sappy.  Towards the end of the book Albom tells us how this book was largely Morrie's idea.  He called it their final thesis.  The money that the publishers advanced was used to pay for the majority Morrie's overwhelming medical bills.  <BR> <BR>One of the thingsthat draw readers to this book may be the fantasy of revisiting our old friends that we haven't seen or heard from in several years.  What would it be like if we got the chance to see these people again and tell them how much me care about them?  Tuesdays with Morrie tells us do this before it's too late.  It was almost too late for Mitch.  In the end though, he really made a difference in his teacher's life, and vice versa.
B000002I77|4.0|One of the things I enjoyed about the 1970s fusion era was the way it allowed musicians to indulge their taste for different genres. Artists are easily pigeonholed, and the more successful they are, the harder it can be to break out of the role they are cast in by fans, the media, and their own promoters. Miles Davis recognized this stultifying syndrome in jazz and refused to be trapped, breaking ground for the merging of segregated forms with his pivotal album \\"Bitches Brew.\\" Other pioneers, like Ornette Coleman, Tony Williams, Joe Zawinul, and John McLaughlin, also cast off the stale conservatism of \\"mainstream\\" jazz and experimented with combinations of jazz improvisation with rock, eastern, Latin American, electronic, and purely abstract forms.<br />In the aptly titled \\"Spectrum,\\" Cobham revealed his interest in, and aptitude for, rock and funk, as well as considerable compositional skills. Fans who were used to the more esoteric, odd-metered intensity of the wildly original Mahavishnu Orchestra might have been disappointed by the down-to-earth, straight time jams found in Billy's solo work, but those of us who appreciate a solid, funky groove along with hot solos immediately cottoned to this side of his personality. We also dug the fact that he could go from barnburner tracks like \\"Quadrant 4\\" and \\"Stratus\\" to the cool and jazzy \\"Le Lis\\" and it was the most natural thing in the world. Yeah, you could dig rock, you could dig jazz: it was all good.<br />\\"Crosswinds,\\" \\"Spectrum,\\" and \\"Total Eclipse,\\" were mainstay albums in many collections during the '70s. Each one reveals different aspects of Mr. Cobham's special talents and tastes. In my humble opinion, they are essential listening for anyone interested in the evolution of jazz-rock.
B00005NGAL|3.0|I own both the Cats video(best play in da world!) as well as the Ultimate Edition DVD of Cats due to my obsession with the beauty of this great play however there were quite a few things that kind of irked me when I made comparisions to both. One I couldn't help but notice the Ultimate Edition(in my opinion's) totally butchering of the music compared to the video. What the heck is up with the whole adding of dog sounds on the Pekes and the Pollicles, I for one love the cats doing the barking themselves! That and I didn't feel the whole intensity in the music on the Rum Tum Tugger song that gets me dancin to it, I mean I could barely hear the awesome guitar solo. All the tempos to me and a lot of the great sound effects from the video were cut or changed. Anybody know why the heck was that? Anyway I personally think the Cats video edition is the better buy.

B000021Y77|4.0|Although it is in german when you have the DVD you can change languages to english. The base of the story is Lola's boyfriend must get a whole lot of money in 20 minutes. HOW??? well thats the whole plot.<BR> It starts out with this wild cartoon and then turns into the &quot;real life&quot; which it is the most of the movie. The movie is a non-stop whirl-win of fun. The excitment and action (not explosives) is great.<BR> I own this movie and although i dont watch it all the time I do find myself going back and watching it whenever i want to see a good action/excitement movie. It has a good plot and the way the movie was put together is new and vibrant. The music supports the film very well also.<BR> I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to talk about doing stuff but doesnt because then you can dream you are Lola on this journey but you never really would be!
B000002J29|5.0|From the mind-blowing sounds of Steve Hackett's guitar on Dance on a Volcano and Robbery, Assualt and Battery to the frightneing accuracy of Tony Bank's synth, this album has to be, in my opinion, Genesis' finest.  And just to ensure that no other of their albums comes even close, they throw in the 23 minute Supper's Ready to polish things off.  <br />I have to say that i was certainly surprised to find that Phil Collins performed the keyboard solos in both Robbery, Assualt and Battery and The Cinema Show, which are both astounding songs in their own right, their beauty accentuated here.<br />I may be only 16 years old, but i appreciate their music tremendously - especially from the post-Gabriel period onward to the departure of Hackett.  This album encapsulates everything great about Genesis on a double CD.
0790740249|4.0|Sitting down in front of something entitled 'Copycat', something that came out in the same year as 'Seven', it's all too tempting to write it off.  Whilst not exactly a classic, this is actually a very competent and scary thriller that works on several levels.  The plot has Sigourney Weaver as Helen Hudson, a renowned criminal psychologist who has developed agoraphobia after an escaped convict tried to kill her 13 months ago.  Alongside this we have Holly Hunter as a hard-hitting cop investigating a grisly string of murders on which they have no clues.  No prizes for guessing that the two team up.  It turns out that this is a copycat killer, replicating famous murders from serial killers in the past.<br />Several things set this apart from others of its ilk, not least the fact that it's quite disturbing, especially thanks to a horribly insane performance from Harry Connick Jnr as the escaped prisoner in question.  Of course, Sigourney Weaver is as excellent as you'd expect, and Holly Hunter is very impressive too.  There's also a real aspect of fright here, drawn out very well in Helen's sense of paranoia and the sense that someone is watching her every move - the creeping suspicion that high-tech security systems won't protect you is palpable.  There's even a little bit of moralising over the celebrity of the serial killer alongside the celebrity of Helen's criminal psychologist.<br />Of course, there's a lot here that's pretty formulaic and despite good performances and a little depth, the basic story has been done before more interestingly.  Still, even if this is never as good as 'Silence Of The Lambs', that's only because that broke the mould.  As it stands, 'Copycat' is a very worthwhile film indeed that deserves a second look.
B00000IQW3|4.0|The Last Starfighter is an excellent fantasy space adventure movie from the eighties. Director Nick Castle responsible for such works as The Boy who could fly and Dennis the Menace really brings out a wonderful little gem. A film that featured the best computer effects at the time over shadowing such films as Tron. Sure the actors in this film are not really well known today (you have to look carefully for Star Trek Next Gens Wil Weaton)except may be Robert Preston from the classic The Music Man. Actor Lance Guest is actually qiute good in the lead. This DVD features a short documentary hosted by Lance Guest himself, quite an informative doco for a small movie. No other big features on the disc. <BR>The Last Starfighter is a great little film, its no masterpiece but well worth watching. Highlights from the film are the special effects and the excellent score by Craig Safan.
B00006LLNU|5.0|WOW! Aural bliss. Not a bad track on the album. Floating along for every song only to be thrown into mach speed at the closing of the final \\"track 8\\", and then left for 'dead' at the end with a low buzz. If I had to get rid of all of my 4000 CD's except one... this would be it. A review can't prepare you for this album! Nothing can! Enjoy.
B0000640VO|5.0|I've been reading some reviews for this film and I really don't care for how unrealistic this film is said to be.  Yes...life is not like the movies, but can we not have the movies take our mundane lives and artistically manipulate it into something more?  One French reviewer said that it did not portray Paris in the way it was at all.  I don't think that really was the point of the movie, nor to portray the most intelligent protagonist.  Amelie is a simple girl.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The world consists of more than just intellectuals.  We already know what the world is like...what reality puts forth.  Why would we have to sit through a movie that shows all of that if we can just step outside our door?  I believe that movies are a form of escape...artistic expression...a way to give form to our dreams.  I don't believe we should make all our movies with our heads in the clouds, but it's good that once in awhile, someone can create something not out of pragmatism but just pure, simple human emotion and fantasy.  The movie was not meant to be a documentary.  Everyone nowadays flocks to the blockbuster hits...action films...films with provocative actresses and promiscuity...or even the downright hardcore films that portray reality right down to its extreme complexities (Requiem For a Dream, FIght Club, which i do like).  It's a nice change to watch a simple film that focuses on artistic imagery and musical score rather than fast paced plot and sexually, superficially stimulating fidgeting with bad actors.  I feel that this movie shows how we forget about the simple things we all can afford in life...how we forget how refreshing and liberating those simple things can be.
B00006V9A0|5.0|...all in all, this is an album for the folks who bought Nevermind back in 91...This is a great album. These songs are all great. Always have been. Always will. This is simply a new order to hear them in and a new CD insert to read...

B000002UVZ|4.0|If memory serves, a number of critics referred to this record when it came out as R.E.M.'s heavy metal album, probably because the producer had done work for the Heavy Metal Kids and people like that and because Peter Buck experimented around with a little power chording on \\"Begin the Begin\\" and \\"These Days\\".  Now, come on, folks - we all know what heavy metal sounds like, and Judas Priest would eat R.E.M. for a between-meal snack.  This is not metal, it's something much more useful.<br />More useful for R.E.M. itself, certainly.  On \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\", they finally found a way to talk to their audience instead of just to themselves, and what they had to say had something to do with the shape of the nation in 1986.  A lot of these lyrics call upon the listener to do something, in words like \\"Let's begin again\\" and \\"I wish to meet each one of you\\" and \\"Let's put our heads together and start a new country up\\".  Which probably goes a long way to explaining why the band played and recorded so loud - they had to wake us up, after all.<br />Well, they got our attention, all right - this album sold better than anything they had issued up to that time.  And once they got our attention, what would they have us do?  Now that's a question without an answer.  This is R.E.M. we're talking about, remember, and they weren't about to give up their mysterious aura so quickly.  That's what makes \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\", and most of R.E.M.'s work for that matter, useful to the audience.  It makes you think.<br />So here's what I think, for whatever it's worth.  R.E.M. was interested in American history, but not as a set of names and dates.  They were interested in the secrets that the landscape promised, in the amount of space given on this continent to people to invent lives, to come up with odd bits of folklore, to make mistakes.  They didn't like the mistakes much, but in 1986 they still believed that the mistakes could be corrected if we worked at it.<br />You can hear the space in the echo all over this record and in that pump organ underlying just about every backing track.  You can hear the eccentricities in the way Michael Stipe grunts about bleeding into the river from a skinned knee, about shouting praise of youth and hope so loudly his hat falls off.  You can hear the folkloric borrowings in the tigers turning to butter, the animals threatening villages, the starving Confederate soldiers selling toothpicks to their officers while they stare hypnotized at mysterious birds.  You can hear the mistakes in the complaints about turning Indian culture into souvenirs and Latin American nations into opium fields.<br />As for the sounds of inexplicable secrets, you can hear that in just about every note - R.E.M. was always one of the deepest-sounding bands on record, and for all the pop-metal veneer \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" was no exception.  Each track stirs about three or four Peter Buck guitar lines into the mix, and the result can echo for hours.  Mike Mills' bass was always the band's most powerful instrument, but here his background vocals took on as much power as his instrument ever did.  And, last but not least, Bill Berry finally got a chance to show what a threat he was to his drum skins, especially with all that echo added.<br />Even the musical jokes add something to the sense of American weirdness.  \\"Underneath the Bunker\\" and \\"Superman\\" are both brilliant little throwaways, and no description of America would be complete without including its genius for sugary snacks.  And in case we missed the point, they threw jokes into the most serious-minded professions of faith - \\"I believe in coyotes and time as an abstract...I believe my throat hurts.\\"  Take that, Jerry Falwell.<br />That's what I think, but as I said, R.E.M. left plenty of space for you to disagree, and that's what makes \\"Lifes Rich Pageant\\" an important piece of work.  The band had finally found a reason for its aura of mystery - it was very useful for showing how mysteriousAmerica itself was.  At this moment in history, when the government makes believe that we're all alike (or should be), the awareness of America's mystery is even more important than it ever was.<br />I don't mean to sound too messianic or worldy-wise about this stuff - even Michael Stipe takes the time to moan \\"I'm so goddamn young!\\"  Then again, it's not often that music invites us to think about what made us great while we dance to it.<br />Benshlomo says, The American melting pot is alive and well, and as bizarre as ever.America itself was.

B00006LLNU|5.0|It was quite by chance that I stumbled across Sigur Rós about 10 months ago. I was trying to find more information about fellow Icelandians múm and found an mp3 of &quot;Ágætis Byrjun&quot;, the title track from their last album. One listen and I was hooked.<br />Since then, Ágætis Byrjun has easliy established itself as one of my favourite albums and the distinguishing feature of having been listened to until the band got around to releasing their next album!<br />Upon first listening to () I must admit to being a little disappointed. I think I was secretly wishing for Ágætis Byrjun all over again, which () isn't. It is a much slower and more comtemplative album than its predecessor and not something that is easy to appreciate in one sitting.<br />I've had () for a little over a week now and it has tunneled itself into my dreams and quiter waking moments. I'm not sold on all of the tracks yet, but track 3, with its exquisite 5-bar piano melody is truly sublime. Tracks 1, 4 and 8 are also standouts for me. I'm less fond of tracks 6 and 7 as they are form the heavier part of the album with massive washes of layered guitar and a driven urgency. That's not to say they aren't great, I'm just partial to the slower stuff.<br />Sigur Rós and () have reminded me once again of why I listen to and enjoy music so much, a sentiment that's best summed up by a passsage from Hesse's &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;: <br />&quot;...for after all music is nothing but an act of courage, a serene, smiling, striding forward and dancing through the terrors and flames of the world, the festive offering of a sacrifice&quot;.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|After garnering 3 Golden Globes (including Best Picture and Best Actress) and 8 Oscar nominations, the public is finally beginning to fully realize the audacity of ''Moulin Rouge.'' Baz Luhrmann's centerpiece of colorful, comedic brilliance and heart-wrenching sentimentality raises the standard of and reinvents the modern musical. Nicole Kidman portrays Satine, a French courtesan working at the Moulin Rouge, a turn-of-the-century nightclub. Despite numerous statements like, ''I can't fall in love,'' Satine eventually falls in love with Ewan McGregor, as Christian, a ''penniless writer.'' The story is mostly told in song, and director Baz Luhrmann pays homage to Elton John, Nirvana, and Patti LaBelle, among others. Reality is never an issue - ''Moulin Rouge'' knows that, and plays upon every aspect of that freedom. The lovers soar above the starlit sky, dance on clouds, and swing around the Eiffel Tower (all with a singing Man in the Moon in the backdrop). This fantasia makes for very interesting eye-candy, and leaves the audience overflowing with emotion. Kidman and McGregor shine as ill-fated lovers (who frequently and unabashedly burst into harmony) and help contribute to make ''Moulin Rouge'' the most ambitious and entertaining film of the past decade.

B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's, Stripped is the vehicle that displays her tremendously wide vocal talents in an array of genres:  Jazz, Blues, Pop, Rock, R& B and Hip Hop.  This CD is reminiscent of Mariah Carey and will catapult her to \\"Queen\\" of Pop music.  Every song is a potential top 20 hit on any billboard chart.<br />Christina has grown up, experienced life and has branched out into her own despite negative criticism from fans, reporters and the music industry.  Her sentiments are expressed in Can't Hold Us Down; Fighter; Soar; and Beautiful.  There are beautiful ballads: Walk Away has a lovely jazz and blues influence which she absolutely \\"kills\\".  Infatuation is a lovely, romantic, sexy song with a flamingo, Latin beat. Impossible captures the Motown era with rich instruments along with her full vocals. Loving Me 4 Me is a beautiful vocal arrangement with a rich R&B sound. <br />Her most personal song on the CD is I'm O.K.  The music is very haunting and is perfect because it gives the feeling of being afraid.  She sings about the physical abuse she and her mother experienced at the hands of her father.  Bruises fade but the memories remain.<br />Christina also takes chances with Make Over and dives into early 70's Go, Go music which I absolutely loved.  The Drums and Guitar just drives this song with such richness along with her vocals.  It's a true work out with a different vocal sound.  Fighter is Rock guitar driven and her vocals do not get lost. <br />Christina Aguilera has definitely left \\"Disney Land' and has entered the \\"Real World\\". She gives her instrument a true work out and covers all spectrums of music genres while giving us a look into the \\"real\\" Christina completely Stripped without the gloss, hype or pretense.  Love It!
B00006F2TV|5.0|Sam Raimi was the best choice for director for Spider-Man. His parents had a Spider-Man mural painted on his wall for him in his childhood, and he had the perfect vision for how Spider-Man should be. Better actors could not have been picked to play these roles; Tobey Maguire made the role of Peter Parker his. Kirsten Dunst was an excellent Mary Jane, and Cliff Robertson and Rosemary Harris were the best as Uncle Ben and Aunt May. J. K. Simmons stole the show as Jameson, who played the part magnificently; he literally WAS Jonah. Sam's brother Ted Raimi (from Xena) was a nice surprise appearing in the Daily Bugle office. Willem Dafoe's Norman/Goblin over-the-top performance was superb, but the armored costume took some getting used to. If you look quickly, you'll see Stan (The Man) Lee making a little heroic appearance! Right from the start, the characters are believable, and the characters are fleshed out wonderfully from the comic. A great deal of time was invested in getting a costume for Spidey that looks awesome; this endeavor was obviously taken very seriously and the designers did a great job.<br />The CGI Spider-Man was fantastic! The talents involved with the CGI captured Spider-Man's movements so flawlessly, I almost believed at some points that it was actually a person performing Spidey's complex acrobatic abilities and fighting style, but would have liked to see a bit more jumping; Spidey can jump pretty high and far, but will hopefully be more prominent when the character is older (in the sequels!) I'll have to get used to the organic webs; which was my least favorite aspect of the film. The creators decided it was easier than having to explain how he was able to pay for the chemicals for the webbing. This doesn't allow us to see Pete as a scientist, which I love, but maybe they will bring some of that out (and some higher jumping) for the sequel! More of the Bugle characters hopefully will make an extended appearance in the sequels, too.<br />The DVD is literally packed with special features from on-screen pop-ups that display information and tidbits pertaining to what was said, or shown in a particular scene, and a \\"spider sense\\" that takes you from the main movie to a mini-movie when you press the proper remote button. The menu selection is a visual treat and the DVD-ROM extras are a nice bonus, from Marvel dot comics to an Activision Spider-Man PC game demo. I would have liked to see some deleted scenes, but disc 2 provides some outtakes and gags which are a delight to see. It finally took a true, talented Spider-Man fan to turn out the best Spidey production I've ever seen. Sam Raimi's love for Spider-Man and the hard work of all the talented people in this film gave those of us who love Spidey an unforgettable movie experience, and just as much work was put into this DVD edition that is a pleasure to own.literally packed with special features from on-screen pop-ups that display information and tidbits pertaining to what was said, or shown in a particular scene, and a \\"spider sense\\" that takes you from the main movie to a mini-movie when you press the proper remote button.

B00000AF95|4.0|While it may be the best selling out the Unmasked albums its not my favorite album that one will go to 1992's \\"Revenge\\" The best cuts are \\"Heaven's on fire\\" \\"I've had enough into the fire\\" and \\"Burn Bit*h burn\\" and the chorus in \\"Get all you can take\\" and a lyric line in it that most people dont know is there it goes \\"WHat (...) differnce can it make?\\" While Animalize is a good album its not the best its worth it if your into 80's metal or a KISS fan
B00005UEAR|5.0|I don't have WDADU yet, but does Dream Theater have any bad albums?  Over the past 4 months I have collected all their studio albums except that one, and I love them all.  They have quickly become one of my top 3 favorite bands, possibly #1.  This album is a true masterpiece.  Disc one has 5 songs.  &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; is the heaviest thing they've ever done, and it works quite well.  It has some great lyrics from Mike, and Incredible solos from John and Jordan.  &quot;Blind Faith&quot; starts off almost like a ballad and turns into a great rocker, with more great instrumental solos.  The lyrics were written by James LaBrie.  The first solo that John Petrucci does is one of my all time favorites, I don't know why.  &quot;Misunderstood&quot; is next, and is perfect all the way up until the end, which can get a little annoying.  &quot;The Great Debate&quot; is where the album starts to take a bit of a dive.  Don't get me wrong, I love it, but IMO it could have been a bit shorter.  Still a great song though.  I don't like Disappear.  I don't dislike it really, but when TGD ends, I usually put on Disc 2.<br />OK, disc 2 is even better than the first(IMO, of course).  The title track, which is 42 minutes long but was recorded on different tracks, is excellent, and I think it does have the feel of one big song.  Anyway, this song alone is worth the price of the album.  I love the overture, which many people don't like.  I think it sounds like a classical overture, and is very beautiful.  &quot;About to Crash&quot; is a good rocker, and I love the end, where they go back to the part from the Overture.  Beautiful.  &quot;War Inside My Head&quot; and &quot;The Test That Stumped Them All&quot; are the heaviest parts.  Very cool, especially the instrumental section in &quot;Test..&quot;.  My favorite moment of disc 2 is definitely the end of &quot;Goodnight Kiss&quot;.  John plays a beautiful, emotional solo, and then it goes right into &quot;Solitary Shell&quot;, which is an incredible transition.  The reprise of &quot;About to Crash&quot; is pretty cool, another good rockin' part.  The &quot;Grand Finale&quot; is ok, but another reviewer got it right when he said that it isn't what you would expect.  It doesn't feel like a grand finale, at least not to me.  <br />If you are new to Dream Theater, I wouldn't get this one yet, but if you are already a fan, buy this, as well as their other albums.  You won't be dissapointed.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I know people who saw &quot;Memento&quot; and absolutely hated it. Mainly because the film plays out backwards, and nobody seems to ever know what's going on. But hey, that's why I love it. Guy Pearce perfectly plays Leonard Shelby, a man who has a rare form of amnesia that allows him to remember everything from his past right up until the incident that took his memory away, but makes him forget everything that happened just 15 minutes ago. Throughout the whole film he has only two friends, but are they really his friends? And, since he's searching for his wife's killer but can't remember any clue he may stumble upon along the way, he has them tattooed all over his body. But are they really clues? Who knows. Because Leonard can't remember what went down 15 minutes ago, we're not allowed to know either. That's why the film literally plays out backwards: to give the audience a sense of what it would be like to suffer from a disorder that leaves you bewildered and clueless. It's the ultimate way to interact with a fictitious character. At the film's end, you may still feel bewildered and clueless, but that is what's so great about it - this has never been done before. &quot;Memento&quot; has become an instant classic, and was hands-down the best film of 2001. And if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? Go watch it before you forget.

B000059ZLH|5.0|Wow, I can't tell you how much I love this thing....I don't know how any fan of this band could ever dislike it. The entire \\"Scenes From A Memory\\" album played live(perfectly, I might add), the \\"Mind Beside Itself\\" trilogy, \\"Learning To Live\\" and \\"A Change of Seasons\\", plus a great commentary by the band. Convinced yet? If not, then read on. The live show is simplay fantastic, I could not have been more impressed by it. Some of my favorite parts:<br />John Petrucci's incredible guitar solos, especially in \\"Fatal Tragedy\\", \\"Through Her Eyes\\", \\"The Spirit Carries On\\", \\"A Change of Seasons\\" and the one he does with Theresa.<br />Watching Jordan Rudess play. It's so awesome. He can play solos like a guitar player, yet he can play some beautiful piano music as well. It's always fun to watch him.<br />Watching Mike Portnoy play. Watching him just fascinates me, and makes me want to just buy a drumset and start playing.<br />The Dance of Eternity. Watching it played live blows me away, especially since I'm a musician. I don't know how much it appeals to non-musicians, but I think it's great.<br />John Myung is indeed underrated. You will see him doing some pretty crazy stuff on here, but I'll admit, you can't always hear the bass as well as I'd like to.<br />Anyways, the only complaint I have(and this is a small one) is that the \\"scenes\\" get kind of annoying. Again, that's a small complaint. Still worth more than 5 stars. You may have heard that the sound quality is bad. I don't really know much about that stuff, but I didn't notice any problems. I can hear it fine. <br />The commentary is great too. It's all great. Now that I've seen this DVD, I can't live without it. If you love Dream Theater, buy this now, it's absolutely necesarry.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Have I completely lost my mind? Call me crazy, but I consider \\"Fight Club\\" to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I'll start off by saying that I am a girl, and this is definitely a guy movie. But I don't care. The one and only complaint that I have about this film is that when its trailer appeared in theaters, it made it look like a beat-'em-up, macho guy-flick revolving around a bunch of men beating the crap out of each other. Well, it didn't sell it to me, and I completely dismissed it. LUCKILY, one of my female co-workers rented it when it came out on video and highly recommended it to me. It wasn't until another co-worker said it was something to check out that I did exactly that: I reluctantly paid the cash to rent it. I went home. I put the tape in my VCR. I fell deeply in love.<br />This film had me from the very beginning. First of all, I had never really seen Edward Norton in any movie before, and if I had I just couldn't remember. I spent the first half of the film marvelling at his wonderful performance as a no-name character who suffers from insomnia and a support group addiction. Ever since this film, I have been a huge Edward Norton fan. And, even though I have never really liked Brad Pitt, I thought even he was perfect in this movie. He plays Tyler Durden, the wild and crazy man Edward Norton's character meets on a plane. They become best friends, and decide to start their own little \\"support group\\": Fight Club, where any man can join, and where every man takes a beating. Yes, the macho fighting is a major part of this movie, but there is a LOT more to it than that, but that is all I will say because I wouldn't want to spoil anything. I will just say that \\"Fight Club\\" warrants at least two viewings, if not more, in order to digest everything.<br />When I finally got a DVD player 2 years ago, \\"Fight Club\\" was one of the first DVDs I bought. The double-disc set is all I could ever want and more: Great commentary by the director David Fincher, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and there is even commentary by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote the novel the movie is based upon (I also recommend that you read that - it's a great book). Plus there are a ton of deleted scenes, public-service announcements, behind-the-scenes featurettes...tons and tons of stuff to satisfy even the biggest \\"Fight Club\\" fan.<br />People have asked me before what it is I see in this movie. I always tell them I love it because the acting is great, the mood of the film is great, it's funny, it's tragic, it's...a little confusing. It's just overall great. And for anyone who saw the trailer and was turned off, I remind you that looks can be very deceiving. I realize now that had I gone just by what I saw previewed at the theaters and not given it a chance, I would have missed out on seeing a really great film. And given the fact that there aren't too many great films out there nowadays, that would have been a real loss.Pitt and Edward Norton, and there is even commentary by Chuck Palahniuk who wrote the novel the movie is based upon (I also recommend that you read that - it's a great book).

B000002TQV|3.0|What really gets me about this album is how good it could have been.  The Bends has some tracks that are among Radiohead's worst (&quot;High &amp; Dry,&quot; &quot;Black Star,&quot; and &quot;Sulk&quot;).  And the lesser known tarcks from Bends era singles/EPs were amazing.  There was &quot;You Never Wash Up After Yourself,&quot; &quot;Maquiladora,&quot; &quot;Talk Show Host,&quot; &quot;Molasses!,&quot; and &quot;How Can You Be Sure?,&quot; among others.<br />If those songs were included, I would have half a mind to give the album five stars despite the not-so-hot tracks.  Unfortunately for us all, they weren't.
0316666343|3.0|Ok.  I finished the book, but I was definitely expecting a lot more.  The beginning of the novel was extremely gloomy, but I found myself becoming bored as I read further.  I never put a book down, but I had to with this one.  Once, I picked it up again, it was bit more interesting.<br />Although the middle of the book was a bit dull, the ending made up for it.  I rate this book a 3 for the middle, definitely not the beginning or end.  <br />As for the characters, the conflicts were resolved which made this an interesting read.  The conclusion was interesting, but I wonder - how realistic?<br />If you like death and afterlife - buy the book.  If not - don't waste your time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new album is great! Xtina's music has changed though, this album is one that she doesn't sing teeny-pop music like Britney Spears! I have to admit Christina is better than Britney. :) Anyways, back to the C.D. The first song I heard from this album was Impossible, where she sang it LIVE on MTV. I love the song! Alicia Keys wrote this song for her. And the other song that I like is Soar, and Dirrty. At first I thought I wouldn't like this album but now that I listened to it more, I like it alot! Christina rules! :) I reccomend that you buy this album today..
B00005JKCH|3.0|This is an example of where the plot loses, once again to the effects.  Don't get me wrong the effects are spectacular, and they are well woven into the story, but the plot is simply pathetic.<br />The plot:  boy gets bit by spider; troubled CEO tests himself on latest product with obvious results.  CEO goes insane, runs round in plastic suit. ...Only one man can stop him - SPIDERMAN!!!<br />Big battle - run credits.<br />Even the sub-plot of the love affair and the eternal triangle between Peter Parker and his two best friends is slow and mangled.<br />Bottom line - too slow, too simple, no twists, BUT great effects.
B00006SFLV|5.0|It's funny; we spend 4 years trying to get the hell out of high school, and the rest of our lives trying to recapture it. Whe MSCL premiered, I was 17. A little older then the characters, but still able to relate. This show was almost TOO realistic, which is why I think it was so quickly cancelled. I imagine parents of teenagers watching this show and being hit so hard by what their kids were going through, that they had to turn the channel. I watch this show now and think: this was high school in the early to mid 90's. Slightly exagerrated? Maybe. But it still hits home with all of its original force. Bottom Line: This show will always be very close to my heart, and when I have children, I will watch it with them so they can see what their father's time in high school was like.
B000022TSV|5.0|I've watched this version of Carmen several times and like it more and more each viewing.<br /><br />This is the first opera I've watched as a movie and the effect is certainly different than before a live audience.  I don't think any movie can compare to having the performance done in the intimate setting of an opera house: and this is the reason it took me a while to appreciate this work. Having said that, this production does please the visual and auditory senses. The scenes are beautiful with a pastel quality to them: just enough color for warmth and atmosphere to complement the locations. Some of the views are panoramic while others a close-up.<br /><br />The roles of Carmen and Don Jose are done by Julia Migenes -Johnson and Placido Domingo respectively. It is hard to imagine two better people for the leads.<br /><br />Although Julia Migenes-Johnson has a wonderful husky voice that complements her part, it is her acting that is truly outstanding. Swiveling hips, swishing raised skirts, ringlet hair and the look that absolutely makes her the genuine temptress and seductress that her part calls for. How could poor Don Jose not fall for her?<br /><br />Placido Domingo's interpretation of Don Jose is stellar. Handsome with a voice to die for! Watching his downward spiral as his relationship with Carmen deteriorates is, from a male perspective, hard to watch. The begging and pleading are heart wrenching and you cannot help feel sorry for Don Jose while at the same time wishing he would stand up for himself.<br /><br />My two favorite scenes are the beautifully choreographed and sung \\"Habanera\\" and the finale \\"It's you! It's me!\\"<br /><br />All in all a wonderful production of Bizet's Carmen in movie form. Highly recommended if you don't mind losing the stage effect of a live production
B00006V9A0|5.0|While some people complain that they're paying large amounts of money for songs they most likely already have, it's worth it simply for \\"You know you're right.\\" Hearing the last song Kurt Cobain recorded after all these years is worth the money. It's as if it's Kurt Cobains final testimony finally being released.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Thank you Miss Aguilera for creating the worst Christmas album ever.  Apparently you can play this one during the Halloween season as well, because it is the most sacriligious piece of [singing] I've ever heard.  The irony of hearing [her] sing \\"Oh, Holy Night\\" does have it's momentary guilty pleasure, but after that it's all down hill.  Yes, we do know you can sing Christina, so stop trilling every note.  Perhaps you were never taught that it's those that sing the most purely and with simplicity that truly take away our breath. ...
0345413377|5.0|When a friend's 12yr old daughter recommended this triology I was reluctant as she'd also recommended Harry Potter, which I'd found lacking in intelligence and imagination. I couldn't believe that everyone was Potter-mad yet someone with the talent of Roald Dahl never had quite as much acclaim. This triology is better than anything I've ever read - It was like a drug, I was up late reading it, trying to tell my fiance everything that was happening with Lyra and Will and Iorek...The whole idea of daemons is just incredible in itself, let alone Pullman's brilliant concept of dust and the emergence of consciousness through evolution. You won't find a book with brains behind it like this for kids anywhere - and it far surpasses adult fiction. It is wonderful to read a STORY so rich in ideas, and beautifully written. I felt like my daemon was being torn away when I finished the Amber Spyglass.Its a book that you will want children everywhere to read - something challenging, deep and intelligent with enough excitement to encourage reading at every opportunity.
0694003611|5.0|Goodnight Moon is a wonderful early childhood book about getting ready for bed.  The first half of the book simply identifies the different things the baby rabbit sees in his room.  The second half has the little rabbit telling everything in his room goodnight, from the moon, to his comb and brush.  On the last page, he says goodnight to the noises everywhere.<BR> This book is perfect for very young children because it relates with something they do everyday.  Brown has done a great job in using simple vocabulary, which rhymes, to interest the child.  While the illustrations in color are a little cluttered, those in black and white are very simple and easy for the reader to recognize.  The book itself is smaller than most books, and is made more durable by using cardboard instead of regular paper. <BR> Overall, this books serves as a perfect early child book.  It is a great, realistic story with fun pictures and easy text.  This book would be perfect for use with any young child.
079074841X|1.0|What´s most interesting or frigthening rather about Kubrick´s films is how he portrays women. In none of them has he ever created a female autonomous character, yet plenty of room for the excess of male characters to degrade women both verbally and visually. <br />In \\"Eyes wide shut\\", jobless/without identity Kidman is kept inside her apartment/preferably kitchen dreaming guiltily of being passively seduced by a male somebody wearing high heels in bed. Another dream where she has sex with several strange men makes her cry like a victim (a woman must be bad to enjoy several lovers) and she is generally crying or acting \\"vulnerable\\" throughout the film. Her most explicit identity is being married to the somebody male Cruise. He never refers to his marriage. Kidman the wife is also shown naked, but not the doctor Cruise. <br />Then there is a brothel catering male sexuality and the male customers are fully clothed & masked and claimed to be very \\"important\\" (ugly old) men, and naked beautiful young women claimed to be unimportant prostitutes serve these men as dead orifices placed on tables etc or staging homosexality for the important men to watch. No sexy naked man in sight. No male homosexual scenes which women would enjoy.<br />One prostitute dies, already portrayed earlier in the film as a naked junkie and sexpartner to a fully clothed 80-year old git, and even dead she is an object in the morgue although of course dispensable as a subject.<br />There are also two grown women at a party giggling and holding hands acting like silly 10 year olds; a 12-year old girl exploited by her father who sells her to 80-year old pedophiles and made sure to be adressed \\"whore\\" several times so we understand the sexually abused child is bad and the old disgusting men - pedophiles/pimp father - are good; and also two less glamourous prostitutes one of which contracts HIV as a punishment. Showing clips of Cruise´s patients, a perfect bigbreasted female model is pointlessly included. A relative to a patient declares her love to Cruise, crying & hysterical, and naturally he patronises her.<br />Kubrick is a wonderful director for men intimidated by women. These men need \\"arty\\" fantasies to escape to (as a change for the sexism of male porn they love) where they can identify with a total degradation of what they fear the most - women. Male reveiwers love sexist Kubrick. He speaks to the sexist inside them.
B00005Q66T|5.0|A logical and belated follow-up to The Immaculate Collection, 11 years earlier. Madonna has progressed well since that collection, and to this day continues to set new trends in music. Her true artistic flair and wonderful craft for versatility has seen her music steadily steered away from the commercial pop sound that made her a star in the 1980's, developing her style into current house/dance/techno trends that still vastly contain elements of pop. She never ceases to amaze and surprise and has done so on each and every one of her albums to date. A modest title, GHV2 opens with the frothy dance/pop sounds of Deeper And Deeper, a strong, melodic, commercial number delivered with a full throated, passionate performance from its star. This steadily leads to Erotica, which contains mild undertones of s&m and well crafted and inventive musical arrangements. Continuing in similar vein is the trance-like Human Nature whilst the mid-tempo ballad, Secret, is delivered compellingly and is vastly infectious with its striking hooks and instantly memroable chrous. Madonna displays her clear diversity on the strong, passionate version of Don't Cry For Me Argentina, taken from her hit movie, Evita. Madonna sings this like a woman on a mission, whilst this aptly leads into the hypnotic sounds of Bedtime Story, which is both stark and compelling. The Power Of Goodbye is breathtakingly beautiful and a real tear-jerker of a ballad, whilst another film track Madonna recorded, Beautiful Stranger showed off her effortless flair for commercial, modern-day pop. The chilling Frozen is hauntingly atmospheric, delivered with a firm, gutsy vocal approach from Madonna whilst this leads into another beautifully mellow ballad, Take A Bow. The swirling psychedlic vibes of Ray Of Light is still a monster dance-floor filler and is Madonna at her hippest, whilst the remainder of the album includes recent hits such as Don't Tell Me, What It Feels Like A Girl, the trancey, hypnotic Drowned World/Substitute For Love (one of her most creative outings) and ends on a triumphant note with the sparse and completley infectious, Music.Madonna is a phenomenal talent that is way ahead of some of her younger contemporaries. If anything this collection makes you appreciate that she hasn't lost her touch over the years an if anything gets better and better with each new project. An essential album!
B00006BTCA|5.0|I'm glad a reveiwer finally mentioned the obvious early T-Heads influence, as well as the more obvious nods to Television &amp; Joy Division.  Influences aside, this is an amazing record.  In a day and age where happy and silly pop dominate the airwaves, its great to hear a record with &quot;mood&quot;, attitude and emotion.  I also hear a nod to Bauhaus, and if you liked any of the aformentioned bands than this one is a no brainer.  Thank you Interpol for debunking The Strokes myth.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|As I said before, this movie is just WOW. I loved it. After all the hype and reviews, I was sure it was going to be garbage, but how wrong was I. Until now, I thought Nicole Kidman was just fair as an actress, now I believe not only can she act but what a lovely singing voice. Coming from England, I have always liked Ewan, even more now. I didn't realise he could sing so good. Each song in this movie hits your heart. The whole story is just beautiful and the characters of everyone involved is perfect. This DVD goes beyond Moulin Rouge and you get to learn more of each actor and their role in this movie.<BR>I have not stopped watching it and that is unusual for me. Give it a try and I promise you, you will not be dissapointed.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is truely amazing. Underneath all the hype and criticism lies a very talented artist and singer. I believe anyone could relate to this album because Christina has stripped herself emotionally. She has expose, on this album, that she is a human being with many problems and insecurites. Anyone could really relate to the issues she sings about. She has put soo much emotion in every song that it has touched me emotionally. All the songs are great. This album has a great mixture of rock, r&b, and soul. Christina really stretch herself on this album; she has put a lot of effort to reach out to fans on a personally level on this album. This album has become on of my favorite album, simply b/c i could relate to soo much what she she has to say. This album is positive, up-lifting, and inspirational. This album is not only for pop fans, but for people who truely enjoys music. On this album, Christina makes music the way its suppose to be. I would recommend anyoen to go out and get this album.
0694502219|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut discusses the importance of science and religion in his science fiction novel \\"Cat's Cradle\\". On the first the protagonist seems to be an average person: He does not have a focus in his life, is unstable and feels unloved. That is very interesting about the book because this ordinary person from the beginning becomes someone special in the end.<BR>The protagonist, Jonah, is a journalist who wants to write a novel about the \\"father of the atomic bomb\\" whose family he meets doing research. Jonah finds out about Ice-nine, a substance that converts water into ice even at high temperatures, it is unclear if this substance is existent or not. This stays mysterious until the ending of the book, which is an apocalypse, all life on earth dies of Ice-nine. The author has a very descriptive style. The story takes place in unpleasant settings. The characters in \\"Cat's Cradle\\" are weird, persons who are very rare in real life because they are so extreme. The plot itself is unrealistic. Vonnegut has a black and white view of life: something is good and bad. There is nothing that is just good or bad. The result of the book is that also science is bad sometimes because it can be destructive and even religion is not only good because it is based on lies. <BR>The book is entertaining and it has an unique humor which is not to be understood for everybody. Who does not like black humor would probably not think the book is funny. But the novel is still a good book to read because it makes people, who are interested in its theme, think about it and get interesting points of view. For people who just want a book for pure entertainment it is not the right book to read.

B000000OYQ|4.0|I have been reading these reviews totally slamming this album. Like Robert Plant, Jimmy Page is NOT Led Zeppelin, these two are halves of the whole that was Led Zeppelin. If that is what you want to hear, PLAY A ZEPPELIN ALBUM for God's sake! I bought this album when it first came out and loved it for what it was. I liked the instrumentals in particular. I got to meet Jimmy Page when he went on tour in Atlanta (he is so little) and experiencing this concert was so amazing. He is a master improvisationalist and quite a showman, even when/if he goofs up. I am not writing this review to review the concert, but the Outrider album.<br />While I had never heard of John Miles or Chris Farley, the vocals fit for the songs they sang on this album. This album, for the time, had fresh sound and clear direction in the production. &quot;The Writes of Winter&quot;, &quot;Prison Blues&quot; and &quot;Emerald Eyes&quot; are my favorite tracks. Robert Plant, I do admit, does sound hurried in &quot;The Only One&quot;, and Chris Farley does an excellent job in &quot;My Hummingbird&quot;. My least favorite track is &quot;Blues Anthem&quot;, it sounded too main stream. All in all, its a good album with more of a vocal effort than with &quot;The Firm&quot;. Jimmy doesn't do too well with musicians and vocalists that don't improvise; these guys did in concert, and that is all that mattered at the time. Thumbs up!
6303014100|5.0|This movie was awsome! This has to be one of the most accurate Civil War films I have ever seen. From the clothing to the battles, the accuracy shown was just outstanding! The acting is superb. There is just one error that bothers me, that is with the battle of Little Round Top. The film shows the men fighting in a thick forest. The real battle ground would have been cleared and the ground would have been been covered with rocks. That mountain slop was cleared a few years befor the actual battle. The film makers made a huge error by filming that battle in a forrest. But every other aspect of the movie was done perfectly. This is a movie you can not miss if you are a Civil War buff.
0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon, like the fish.  You won't forget her anytime soon.  Sebold's book is heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.  It is an astonishingly beautiful.  It is sad.  It is moving.  So much happens that you really need to read it.  Actually, do don't read it so much as experience it.  This is not easy book to read--child murder is not easy to read--yet, Sebold makes you face all of it.  There a touch of the magical and dreamy here, but that is as how it should be.  The book is something you never will forget.
B000002LFZ|3.0|This has been replaced by the 2-CD \\"Very Best of Fleetwood Mac\\", which only costs a little more, but has many more tracks, including some extremely popular songs like \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Second Hand News\\" that are strangely missing on this \\"Greatest Hits\\".  Also the new collection features much better sound quality.
B00006F83Y|5.0|I honestly don't like 99% of today's crop of rock bands coming out today. Personally I think most of the bands that I have heard from The Hives to The White Stripes blows chunks. I am more of a goth/industrial fan so the angst of some of these bands comes off as fake and phony to me. Along comes Queens of The Stone Age, and whadda ya know?! They kicked me in the behind with their crunchy yet melodic guitar riffs and thunderous drum beats (provided by none other Foo Fighters' Dave Grohl). When I first heard \\"No One Knows\\", I originally didn't know what to think of the song. I wasn't at all impressed. The more I heard the song, the more it started to grow on me. Eventually the song has become one of my favorite songs of the year. Needless to say, I had to buy the album. Thankfully I struck gold today and found a copy of \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" in the used bins. Asides from the first track which I found to be annoying, it didn't take long for me to become hooked on Queens of the Stone Age, or at least \\"Songs For the Deaf\\". This is definitely one of the handful of rock albums I have bought this year that earns a mention on my best of 2002 list. I don't hear the phoniness or the insincerity in the band's music. I may just have to check out the band's other albums if I dug \\"Songs For the Deaf\\" so much.
B000050HTO|5.0|Though it is truly impossible to edit Dylan's career highlights down to 2.5 hours (and this collection doesn't come close to doing that, especially with some of the random selections on disc 2), the sound quality is substantially better than the originally issued CDs.  Now Sony needs to get around to reissuing Dylan's entire discography as they have for some of his progeny (e.g., Byrds & Simon & Garfunkel, but unfortunately, not Springsteen)
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Blondie is one of the few bands I still listen to on a regular basis. Their music has played a huge influence on me over the past two decades. I was ecstatic to discover that they finally put out a greatest hits collection of all their hits, digitally remastered. I was even more ecstatic to find a new copy in the used cd bins today, still with that annoying seal at the top of the cd case intact. The band's \\"best of\\" collection was good but outdated, production-wise as well as song-wise as well. I always thought Blondie needed to put out a greatest hits, a more complete collection of their hits than their \\"best of\\" collection. The songs were definitely in dire need of being remastered too. Thankfully someone must have heard my prayers and answered them with this wonderful 19 track collection of Blondie's greatest hits. I was even more pleased that \\"Maria\\" was tacked on. That was one of my favorite songs off the band's comeback album \\"No Exit\\". There were even a few of songs that I haven't even heard; \\"Union City Blue\\", \\"Picture This\\", \\"The Hardest Part\\", and \\"Island of Lost Souls\\". Otherwise all of my favorite Blondie songs are found on this complete collection. I can never tire of listening to \\"Heart of Glass\\" or \\"Call Me\\". Those songs still hold up to me to this day, and they sound even better now that they have been given a digital remastered treatment. Deborah Harry could give a lot of today's female artists a run for their money with her ability as a singer and her gorgeous looks. She actually has talent behind her Playboy bunny looks, most female artists today don't amount to even a hill of beans in the talent department. Blondie's greatest hits is a great reminder to the band's legacy and how timeless their music is.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Very good cast, very good plot!! This is definitely one of the best films of the 90's! The fact that there is so much at stake, such as the sake of mankind, the love of Liv's with her boyfriend and the life of the GREAT as always Bruce Willis makes it really interesting and worth to watch! I recommend it to any film collector!!!!
B00005V9L1|5.0|Beautiful.  That's all you need to know.  This is the most original, ingenious film I've ever seen.  Time travel, insanity, teenage angst, love, family, sacrifice, horror, and so much more to this film.  The acting is superb, the plot is fun and different, and the soundtrack is used to maximum effect.  The end result is a haunting, enjoyable, touching story that will leave you thinking and smiling with an aching heart.
0800177177|4.0|Amazing how this director manages to make so scary a tragic love story like this... He describes very well the dramatic story of Dracula's lost love and at the same time he makes it really frightening! I don't even know if this movie should be included in the, horror section of films or in the love stories.. It is really amazing and unique how this exciting director, in collaboration of course with the writer, manages to make the viewer fall in love with the story and the protagonists... unique and tempting for any viewer. Certainly a must-see for everyone who enjoys the combination of love and horror in a film!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|stop comparing Christina Aguilera with Britney 'Playback' Spears. First because Christina can kick Britney, Christina has the voice and the talent. the album is amazing and she rocks!. Best songs from Strpped: Primer Amor, Infatuation, Can't Hold Us Down, The Voice Within, Fighter, Get Mine Get Yours and Beautiful.
0792843584|3.0|Anyone looking for a slice of Western history should be warned that Michael Cimino's film about the Johnson County War is wildly inaccurate.<br />That said, this three-and-a-half hour Western epic is grand and beautiful, though overlong.

B00006CXXU|4.0|The Incredibe Sophmore Album<BR>1~Stripped Part I- sets the stage for the album, that this album is honest as it gets, \\"no hype no glass, no pretense just me stripped\\"<BR>2~ Can't Hold Us Down- awesome, awesome, the beat is hot and displays a good message for girls to say whats on our minds and not feel pressured by men<BR>3~ Walking Away- Her voice is pretty and the lyrics are smart, but I think it's a little too slow and dragging it would be a better song if the tempo was just a little faster<br />4~ Fighter- hot!! i love it, she works the rock ballads, another powerful song<BR>5~Interlude<BR>6~ Infatuation- Latin Pop, she sang this song at the olympics, it's about how she can't help but be in love with her man, even though her mom told her to stay away<BR>7~ Interlude<BR>8~ Loving me 4 me- Blues, the lyrics once again are gorgeous, you'll be able to relate to this song if you have ever been in love<BR>9~Impossible- Sung with Alicia Keys, I like this song, but after the first part it gets on my nerves a little bit, it's cool to listen to once and while though.<BR>10~Underappreciated- A very relatable song, awesome, she's talkin about relationships \\"giving more than I get\\"<BR>11~ Beautiful- this will be topping the charts, soo inspirational, powerful, she says so much in the chorus alone<BR>12~Make Over- absolutely hate this song, wish it wasn't on the album, it makes her voice sound bad and it gives me a headache.  Sounds like Sheryl Crow trying to sound like Pink.<BR>13~Cruz- gorgeous, her voice sounds amazing the song is about leaving something and enjoying every moment of it<BR>14~Soar-BEAUTIFUL lyrics, very clearly defines why she took so much time to create this album, and how she came about finding her true self.<BR>15~Get Mine Get Yours- love it, her voice sounds good, racy lyrics, about just getting some, no strings attached<BR>16~Dirrty- who doesn't love this song? the lyrics make your body wanna get up dance<BR>17~Stripped Part 2- personal interlude<BR>18~The Voice Within- incredible!!It's a touches every inch of the skin, gives me goosebumps kind of song. very inspirational and this track is where her voice sounds best.<BR>19~I'm OK- oh my goodness, this song is about family life, shes very brave to get this personal.  an abusive father is what she sings about, reminds me of Jewel, just her voice and a guitar<BR>20~Singing My Song- an awesome way to end the album, strong lyrics<br />Definitly worth your money!!
B0000714B5|2.0|Cinematographer Sven Nyquist, best known for his work with Ingmar Bergman, delivers some gorgeous visuals for this otherwise unremarkable film.  _Siddhartha_ runs a mere eighty minutes (not counting the interminable closing credits), yet  feels too long by half.  Dull, dull, dull.
0345347951|5.0|This book, by master Arthur C. Clarke, is a startling and speculative look at the ultimate destiny of mankind.  It begins by answering (or seeming to answer) the question of &quot;are we alone?&quot;  The book proceeds plausibly enough by beginning with the arrival to earth of intelligent aliens who are as far advanced over mankind ethically as they are technologically.  The book at first seems to end its speculation there, but there is far more to come.  My only criticism is that Clarke's vision of our future is not uplifting, and is frankly somewhat depressing.  Paradoxically, this does not take away from the quality of the novel.  While many books are called &quot;classics,&quot; this novel really is one.<br />This is a classic novel of intelligent speculation that belongs in every science fiction afficianado's library.
0375703861|1.0|I have just finished this book well actually I've got about another 100 pages to go and I don't know if I can be bothered to read anymore. I had heard such good things about this book but I really just couldn't get into it and even now all this way through I am not sure what the point of the book is. As for laughing out loud well I felt more like crying. Over-hyped and over-priced.
0440416027|5.0|Caitlin Stock October 29, 2002<BR>  <BR>   Skellig, David Almond  <br />     <br />    What are shoulder blades for? One theory is that they are where your wings were when you were an angel and will come again. \\"What are you?\\" said Michael, who is the main character in the book Skellig. Michael is a boy would does not have it very easy, his little sister was born to early and he just moved into a broken down house, that has a toilet in the living room. Also he found an old man named Skellig, in his garage, with bumps on his back. This is an interesting fiction/fantasy book.<BR>     Awesome, exciting, and touching are some words someone would use to describe the book, Skellig. Skellig was a page-turner because; it involved adventure and heartbreak. Every page was like jumping into the book. The author, David Almond, really wrote it from a first person point of view. He also made it seem that you were part of the book and you could visualize the characters speaking. Every page seemed to have some magic on it that made you want to read more and more. If some one said that this book sounded boring, with out even reading it, by the end of the book the person would have a whole different point of view. This book could not be boring because it involves too much heartbreak, adventure, and excitement. a boring book does not give detail.skellig gives so much detail, you literally feel like you are acting out a part in the book. Most kids could connect to this book because; it involves a lot of choices. Kids today seem to make alot of choices and have problems choosing. this book not only is adventurous it deals with making choices.  <BR>     I think that this book can prepare you for the worst. Michael had every odd against him and still he survives by making choices and not giving up. This book would be a great book for older kids because little kids would not get some of the main problems in this book. Also any kind of person would love this book because it is not just setfor one group of people. I would recommend this book because; it is a page-turner, exciting, and heart breaking.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD Rocks!

The others are Great TOO! Christina is now more mature on this album! &quot;Get Mine, Get Yours&quot; has music that sounds like it could be on the first Album. Alot of people don't like &quot;Dirrty&quot;, I love it, especially with Redman! Some of the songs swear in them, but it's cool!

B00006CXXU|5.0|At first, I was unsure of what to expect from Christina Aguilera's \\"new sound\\". Despite her undeniably amazing voice, she'd always been put in the same category as Britney Spears and those other pop princesses, largely due to the music she was given; it was beneath her talents. And finally, she is able to prove just how good she can really be.<BR>Forget all your preconceptions of the diminutive singer, and just listen, for \\"Stripped\\" is an album that you will treasure. First of all, it is a breath of fresh air in a year full of pitifully bland, processed music. And whether or not you like the controversial first single, \\"Dirrty\\", doesn't even matter: NO other songs on the album are anything like it.<BR>From the edgy hip-hop of \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", to the sexy, bluesy tones of \\"Walk Away\\", Aguilera has shown (with just the first two songs on the album) that the girl-next-door on the cover of her debut was simply a manufactured pop creation. But this is the real Aguilera: \\"Stripped\\". She is a mature, confident young woman with an unbeatable voice.<BR>Even after you have heard about her false, backstabbing friends (\\"Fighter\\"), her insecurities (\\"Beautiful\\" - a gem), her screaming about wanting to \\"live simple and free\\" (the fantastic \\"Make Over\\"), or a relationship dominated by, and solely based on, casual sex (\\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\", which acts as the complete contrast to \\"Genie In A Bottle\\"), you are still not prepared for what's to come: \\"I'm OK\\". On this track, Christina gets personal. Extremely personal. An open letter to Aguilera's abusive, wife-beating father, this beautiful guitar-ballad is the ultimate tear-jerker. Aguilera is unafraid to show her emotions, even starting to cry at the end of the first chorus, when she sings (ironically), \\"I'm OK...\\"<BR>With \\"Stripped\\", Christina Aguilera has delivered a masterpiece. If you want an album that will entertain you from start to finish, complete with Soul, R&B, alternative rock and hip-hop beats, then this is the album for you: a true masterpiece that deserves as many awards as it can get. I, for one, am glad that my Aguilera-loving best friend bought me this album. Although not initially impressed with his gift, I am still thanking him now.<BR>Well done, Christina! You have turned a cynic into a fan, and the only way to go from here is up, up and up.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This 2 cd set is fantastic!  Not only does it include his greatest songs from the past, it also included some new songs of his.  He also includes covers of other artists' songs, reminding listeners that he is an incredible singer in addition to a great songwriter.  What a fantastic collection!
B00005K3O4|4.0|In the endless effort to expand my vast array of cult/trash-cinema \\"classics\\", I decided to give the Killer Klowns a whirl. What I saw was one of the most bizarre and absurd flicks I've ever laid eyes on! Needless to say, this one's definitely a \\"keeper\\" for my DVD shelf, filed right next to Flash Gordon and The Thing With Two Heads! The whole flick is so unbelievably ridiculous, you just can't help but be entertained by it!<br />Indeed, it has it all: A preposterous premise that somehow got approved by the studio suits. Less-than-stellar acting by a few of the principals, and the \\"hero\\" playing his part a little too straight-laced. The perversion of various implements of klownery into weapons of annihilation. Silly klown antics gone horribly wrong. It's ludicrously fun to watch on those days when some pretentious bit of \\"serious\\" avant-garde celluloid simply ain't gonna cut it. <br />The special features included with the movie are of the standard type you'd expect to see on a Collector's Edition DVD. There's behind-the-scenes featurettes, a theatrical trailer, deleted scenes, and a commentary track by the movie's creators. In the secondary track, the Chiodo brothers go over the usual stuff you'd expect to hear in a commentary track, including their childhood dreams of becoming to be movie-makers, discussions about how many of the characters were based on childhood friends, memories of the actors that played the various roles, and certain scenes that were particularly difficult to film. Throw in a few quasi-tangential anecdotes, and (voila) you have the Killer Klowns Kommentary Trakk in a nutshell.<br />Then there's the \\"Easter Egg\\" materials, which pop up when you let the main menu display run for a couple of minutes. Sadly, these \\"extra\\" extras aren't all that impressive. The only items here is a re-dub of a line from the movie, and a few video snippets of people auditioning for the roles of the Klowns in full costume. No offense to all you Klown-o-philesout there, but I think I'd get more excited watchin' paint dry than look at these not-so-special \\"treats\\"...<br />`Late
0792842723|5.0|Goldeneye is one of the best Bonds. It has a great Bond actor Pierce Brosnan. It also has one of the strongest villians being Alec Trevelyn aka 006. It has a great story to it that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I love the begining at the chemical weapons facility. The chase with the tank is awesome. If you are looking for a good action packed Bond adventure that goes back to what made the Connery movies so great this is the movie for you.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I won't take up too much time with a movie review but let's face it. Spiderman rocked the socks off of movie goers everywhere. It was everything it should have been and more. I couldn't have been happier with the product released in theatres that great summer ago. Now to the real meat of this review, the DVD release.<br />Could this DVD have been any more rushed?<BR>1)Navigating the on screen menu is VERY hard when your guide is a tiny red dot you can barely even notice.<BR>2) Features that were already shown on TV to do nothing but promote the film do not count as features taking you &quot;inside&quot; the making of the film.<BR>3)While it may appear that there are alot of features they are very short and you will go through them so fast you'll wonder what the big hype was about.<br />After viewing this DVD I feel my spider senses going off, just as with the X-Men DVD I feel they are secretly planning a bigger and better release in the future. So proceed with caution, I on the other hand am content with just owning the movie. They won't get more money outta me.
0792842731|5.0|This is a Bond film with high tech terroism, while still keeping up a good story. The only problm with the film is the villian he's a [week person], but the handcuffed bike chase will make up for it. The plot is a power hungry villian Elliot Carver is making headlines for his own paper titled Tomorrow by preforming terroist attacks. Bond is assigned to stop Carver before he creates a war between China and America. This is a great Bond film with great action. If you see any Bond film make sure it's this one.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana was one of the greatest bands of all time. They are this for two reasons: One-The passion in the words and the music played.Two-Kurt Cobain.<BR>I believe that this is a great album for those who have recently found Nirvana.  It should be called &quot;Songs That are Well Known&quot;  <BR>It should include more for the avid fan.  &quot;Something in the Way&quot;, &quot;Aneurysm&quot;, &quot;On a Plain&quot; and many more should have been included but it is a great collection anyway.<BR>The new track &quot;You Know Your Right&quot; is great.  It makes my heart pound everytime I hear it. I am so glad that a new song was added because it makes it seem like Kurt is still here. And as physco as that sounds, thats a nice feeling to have.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Who knew that the teen pop sensation 4 years ago, who sang coming out of a bottle would grow up to be a young mature woman who's in control. <BR>In Stripped, Aguilera expresses her new found maturity and raw talent both vocally and lyrically. The vocals are strong, raw and quintessentially defines what a diva truly is and the lyrics are deep and questions about society, the ups and downs of love and life in general. <br />There are many tracks that standout in this album. <BR>\\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" deals with the double standard of women in society. She confidently sings, \\"The guy gets all the glory the more he can score, but when the girl does the same, you call her a  w h o r e...\\" <br />\\"Walk Away\\" is pure R&B genius that seems to never end. She channels the great soul divas (Aretha, Etta, Billie Holiday) through her voice. Aguilera sings the song with pure vocal articulation and acrobatics. She confeses, \\"I was naive, your love was like candy, artificially sweet, I was deceived by the wrappings..\\" <br />\\"Impossible\\" which Aguilera worked with R&B diva Alicia Keys is reminiscent of old R&B tunes that are classics. The melody, the background vocals, the magic touch of the pianos delivered by Keys, fuse into a great R&B track. <br />\\"Beautiful\\" really is beautiful. Aguilera's voice shines with purity, hurt, and truth. She chants, \\"We are beautiful no matter what they say, words can't bring us down...\\" As Whitney has her \\"I Will Always Love You\\" and Celine with her \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" Aguilera has her \\"Beautiful\\" and no else can sing best other than her. <br />\\"I'm Okay\\" deals with her father's abuse of her mother. The song is haunting and brutally honest. Her voice in this song has so much vulnerability, hurt, anger, and innocence. <BR>She sings, \\" Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same...for you it's just a memory, but for me it still lives on...\\" After hearing the track, you wish you could give her a big hug. <BR>Other great tracks include \\"Make Over\\" which is completely different to the other tracks in the album. She experiments with alternative rock vocally and she succeeds by screaming at the top of her lungs like any indie-rock chick. <br />\\"Loving Me For Me\\" is passionately sweet, melody wise and vocally. She talks about her love and how he's loving her for her. She sings coyly,\\" Unconditionally you're there for me, Undeniably you inspire me, spiritually...it doesn't matter about the money I make or what i do, or that I'm a star...\\" <br />The last track \\"Keep On, Singin' My Song\\" is a no holds bar vocal extravaganza complete with a gospel choir background and a note that Aguilera holds for 13 seconds that leaves you in awe. <br />This album belongs with the hall of fame of great albums. Janet had her \\"Velvet Rope,\\" Madonna with her \\"Ray of Light,\\" and Lauryn Hill had her \\"Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" and Christina can proudly display her album \\"Stripped\\" with the rest those superstars.
6305358613|4.0|This stylishly filmed historical drama covers the ascendancy of Elizabeth to the throne of England. Cate Blanchett is excellent as the young princess Elizabeth, who survives the plotting of her half-sister Mary and her Catholic supporters and takes the throne upon the death of the childless queen.<br />This film is more about holding on to a shaky throne by means of secret negotiations, assasination and conspiracy. There is little of the \\"real\\" history, though there is one tiny fragment of Elizabeth I's Tilbury speech (\\"I know I have the body but of a weak and feeble woman; but I have the heart and stomach of a king\\") and a Reader's Digest version of the Marriage Speech to Parliament ends the film. So if you are a history buff, you may be disappointed, but if you like conspiracy and dark plotting, this is definitely your film.<br />The cast is fine, with Cate Blanchett moving smoothly and believably from the young princess to the care-worn and nervous queen. Joseph Fiennes is good as Dudley, and I especially liked Geoffrey Rush as Walsingham.<br />The cinematography is good, though the director seems to go overboard with top-down shots that give a great view of cathedral columns but get tiresome after the fifth or sixth time you peer at a scene from a pigeon's viewpoint. The sound on this DVD is particularly good--the surround sound was excellent. Sometimes the score is overpowering but the music is always thrilling (Galliards and Pavanes at the beginning and ending, inexplicably but thrillingly with Mozart's Requiem.)<br />All in all, an enjoyable film, light on the history but well-focused on the troubled beginning of Gloriana's reign.

B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana, the band that revolutionized 90's rock n roll, is worth more then 14 songs.  Every song here is good in their own ways, and make up a pretty good \\"greatest hits\\" album, but there are a few songs missing.  Songs like \\"Something in the Way\\" \\"Aneuryism\\" and \\"Drain You\\" should be included, because honestly those are some of their best songs.  Not to downplay songs like \\"About a Girl\\", \\"Come As You Are\\", \\"Lithium\\", \\"All Apolagies\\" or \\"Rape Me\\" but there should definately be more included.  Its good for what it is, but it could be alot better. by the way the new song \\"You Know You're Right\\" is a standout, shows what potential their new stuff could of had.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I'd like to say i love it and i will never listen to Britney again...yet Christina seems so down in this. The only fast songs (only 4!)seem to have something to do with sex. Not to get me wrong...i like Christina more then Britney..and christina's voice is amazing...but she just sings so many slow songs on the album..out of 20 songs i figured she'd have more then just 4 be fast. She needs to perk up a lil...and more songs with rappers like Lil' Kim and Redman! They are off the hook! peace out! buy the CD!
B00000JNO1|4.0|When I first started purchasing music back in the mid to late 80s, I bought my share of what Brian Henneman of The Bottle Rockets calls \\"welfare music\\".  I never had much spending money as a teenager so to get as much music at a time as possible, I'd go to the K-Mart across town and root through the bargain cassette bin.  The bin was a large metal basket filled with tapes piled several feet high, consisting mostly of country, southern rock, and oldies if I recall correctly.  My southern rock collection benefited greatly from these trips to the bargain bin and I soon had my share of 4-dollar cassettes by the likes of Lynyrd Skynyrd and the Marshall Tucker Band.<br />One of the tapes I rescued from that bargain bin at K-Mart was Lynyrd Skynyrd's often overlooked classic, Nuthin' Fancy.  With the exception of the opening cut, \\"Saturday Night Special\\", which made a bold stance against handguns and still gets played on classic rock radio today, Nuthin' Fancy is devoid of the hits that made Skynyrd popular outside the South.  Instead, what you get is great music that refreshingly doesn't sound like it was created just to get played on the radio like the songs on many other 70s rock albums.  <br />Stylistically, Nuthin' Fancy is all over the place.  After the hard southern rock crunch of \\"Saturday Night Special\\", Ronnie gives one of his blues-iest vocal performances on \\"Cheatin' Woman\\".  \\"Railroad Song\\" and \\"Made in the Shade\\" are fine slices of traditional American music, though they are probably my least favorite tunes on the album.  \\"I'm a Country Boy\\" is a southern rock kiss-off to big city life, a common theme in Ronnie's lyrics over the years.  \\"Am I Losin'\\" is a catchy mid-tempo song chronicling how Ronnie's relationships with some of his friends became strained once he started making lots of money.  \\"Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\\" is a barroom classic in which Ronnie boasts like a rapper about the female company awaiting him in every town including one special Memphis \\"queenie with long brown curly hair\\".  Yes, lyrically it might put off some listeners, but \\"Whiskey Rock-A-Roller\\" is still a damn catchy song.  Probably my favorite song on \\"Nuthin Fancy\\", though, is \\"On the Hunt\\", the hardest song Skynyrd ever recorded.  This song, which describes Ronnie's empathy for a groupie who regularly hangs out near his hotel, sounds metal enough that it wouldn't feel that out of place on Corrosion of Confomity's Deliverance album.<br />If Nuthin' Fancy was Skynyrd's only album, I'd give it 5 stars and move on, but since they set the standard so high with their previous albums, Nuthin Fancy rates `only' a very strong 4 stars.  Still, if you enjoy their classic earlier albums, Pronounced Leh-Nerd Skin-Nerd and Second Helping, you're almost surely going to like Nuthin Fancy too.  It is damn sure impressive for an album that K-Mart considers 'welfare music'.
1400031346|5.0|In more 'traditional' detective novels, the detective is an embittered, experienced, cynical witness to the seamy side of society (in addition to being--most likely--male and Causcasian).  The remarkable Precious Ramotswe is none of those things.  Precious is a portly-but-dignified, 38-year-old lady living in Botswana with absolutely no detective experience, who takes it into her head to found a detective agency when her father dies and leaves her a little money.<br />Preciouse Ramotswe turns the whole idea of being a detective inside out.  Although she does solve cases, they don't seem to be the point of the tale but secondary to Precious herself.  And I must say I found her completely compelling.  Completely centered and self-assured without being cocky.  Size 22 without self-loathing (and with multiple marriage proposals).  A great sense of humor and clever without being cynical.  <br />It's as though being a detective was a metaphor for taking care of people.  Detecting = observing the world around.  Observing the world = taking care of the people in it.  Detective as mother.<br />Although in parts it is quite funny (the bit where the snake gets snuck under her car), on the whole I found it supremely moving.  Alexander McCall Smith mixes Precious' resolution of her cases with lyrical passages describing the Botswana countryside that Preciouse observes as she passes through it in her trusty white van.<br />My only caution is that readers with a taste for complex who-dun-it thickly plotted detective novels will find this VERY different.  But anyone else reading this review--anyone that just appreciates wonderful writing--should PLEASE buy this book.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Ever since he incurred a head injury while attempting to stop the rape and murder of his wife, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) hasn't been able to make new memories. He's forced to take pictures of, and write notes on, the people he's met and places he's been. Despite his handicap, Leonard hopes to find those who raped and murdered his wife.<br />Memento is the most innovative and absorbing thriller to come out in years. It begins at the end, and ends at the beginning. The story is told in segments, where the events of each subsequent segment precede the events of the previous segment. Simultaneously, black and white segments proceed in a chronological order. They're inserted in between the other non-chronological sequences.<br />Christopher Nolan presents us with a thrilling and provocative noirish screenplay. He expertly looks at how memory can be manipulated, how far people will go to get what they want, trust, perception, and guilt. There are many twists and turns as we're kept on our toes as Leonard searches for those who destroyed his life.<br />Guy Pearce carries the film on his head and shoulders; he is able to show just the right amount of anger, frustration, paranoia, and confusion in a masterful performance as Leonard Shelby. Pearce is backed up by strong supporting performances from Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss.<br />Exhilarating and unsettling, Memento is a film you won't soon forget.
B00005QW4K|4.0|Army of Darkness continues the Splatstick tradition of it;s predecessor Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn. Here we find our hero Ash (The mighty Bruce Campbell) stranded in Medieval times, surrounded by \\"Deadites\\", and short on allies. Luckily he has an endless supply of one-liners to go along with his chainsaw and shotgun....<br />  The movie is hilarious; I laughed more than I do for most straight comedies. The original ending is intact, but I wish they could have found room on the disc for the ending shown in theaters, for completists like myself. The commentary by Campbell and Sam & Ivan Raimi is a laugh riot, as well as being informative, and the handful of deleted scenes are fun, too. The subtitle option enables you to see the film's storyboards in the corner of the screen while viewing the picture, and there's a small gallery of production art as well. No trailers or anything else, though. The disc is kinda short on extras, but Dead-heads will find it worth purchasing....
B00005JL2O|5.0|This movie was HILARIOUS!! Sure I liked the first two Austin movies, they were very funny. I still like to watch them. Maybe I was expecting to be let down by the third installment. But Myers has given me a real treat. I saw this movie twice at theaters and I intend to own a copy as soon as it is released. <BR>Smoke and a pancake anyone?
B00005AAFS|5.0|Wow, Rammstein drops the bomb again, and its nothing short of deadly. A great cd put out by one of my favorite bands, and even greater when I can understand most of it. Guess german lessons pay off, eh?<br />Well the top song here for me is \\"Sonne\\". Great song, has a catchy tune, and is very undieing. Sticks in the head for days to come.<br />So remember, Rammstein is not specific to any social group. Being a goth, I must say that I love the organs and choir pieces. But others will love other parts!<br />Pick it up now before I kick your teeth in, Du krank katze.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|but still deserve 5 stars.  Very creative and funny.  Please watch it at least 2 times.
B00006LLNU|5.0|There are two things I want to say right out concerning this album.  First it is not as similar to their earlier work as some reviewers have claimed, it exceeds their first two albums by leaps and bounds by actually stripping out the previous layers of sound (orchestrations, etc.) to reveal a sparser and more haunting approach to pieces of music that transcend the confines of popular music.  The second is that this album is easily my pick for best album to be released since Radiohead's \\"OK Computer,\\" and in many respects is much more timeless than any of that band's work is and will likely ever be.<br />Let me elaborate further to explain both claims more clearly. It is painfully obvious that \\"rock\\", as we have known it, is and has been dead for some time.  Innovative artists growing out of that genre have attempted to push in various directions whether they be electronica or through the \\"post-rock\\" movement that this band has been lumped into.  Radiohead's \\"Kid A\\" is the most popular expression of this movement forward, combining both post-rock and electronic elements.  But many of these pioneering bands (including GYBE, Mogwai, and even electro artists like Autechre) have still remained more or less in the confines of the popular rock medium, either through structure and dynamics or instrumentation.  But now Sigur Ros has steeped so far outside of those confines that to call them a \\"rock\\" (even \\"post-rock\\") band is to denegrate what they have done on this album.<br />On () Sigur Ros show that they have more in common with modern composors Arvo Part and Henryck Gorecki than Radiohead or GYBE!, and I believe they do so unconciously.  Where so many post-rock bands cite Part and other modern composors as influences, Sigur Ros doesn't cite, they just create a class and quality of music that places them firmly in the composor's camp.  Another referance point for the music found on this album is the Sacred Music of the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches, obviously a long cry from CBGB's.  <br />But this isn't a \\"classical\\" album by a long shot either, and to be fair there is some Black Sabbath creeping in around the corners here and there.  Instead what the band does is take their sparse instrumentation (an instrumentation owing itself initially to the rock tradition) and create pieces of music similarly structured and as utterly transcendent as those created by the likes of Part, Gorecki and the numerous Church masters.  Yet at the same time they submit the proceedings to the worldy with slightly mundane and darker passages that work to ground the pieces in terra firma from time to time.  As a result Sigur Ros has created something wholly unique:  This is sacred music, not for a specific religion, but for the whole world.  It is complex and weighty and all the things that you would expect sacred music to be, but with a patient ear and an open soul this music will lift you into realms where few musicians have been able to lead us.  <br />It is appropriate that this album was released the day John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\" was reissued.  They are both music for the ages that sanctify the terristrial while reaching far beyond it into the realms of heaven.<br />And, just as Coltrane turned his masterwork on the work of four talented and dedicated musicians, Sigur Ros does the same, with little hubris, just four men and simple instruments on which they have leared to sing life itself and all that is beyond it.
6305428557|5.0|They are more like suppoting actor/actress and not really important here.  In fact, there are no dominant actors here. The players are small towners in Wales.  I just love this charming, pleasant, and heart-warming comedy film.

0060930349|4.0|Why do so many reviewers write about how this is a \\"right-wing\\", Republican history when the author in fact praises Democratic presidents such as Andrew Jackson, James K Polk, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson, and Harry Truman while critizing Republicans like US Grant, William McKinley, and Dwight Eisenhower. Besides, his critizism of FDR and JFK are likely to become more mainstream as the events move into the distant past and those academics who remember these men personally or first-hand begin to die off. Upon objective interpretation of the facts in hind-sight, these left-wing giants do not look so wonderful. And, while acknowledging Reagan's importance and charm, the author does portray Reagan to be an airhead. This book seems to be a rather even handed history, only appearing right-wing because most historians take a left-wing point of view.
B00003CWTI|4.0|\\"Magnolia\\" is a long, depressing, sad, and tragic movie that is done in a very beautiful and unique way.  Very rarely does a film like this come by.  The film is complex, but it doesn't try to follow a basic plot structure.  Characters talk like real people, instead of just talking about things that center around the plot or point.  I do admit that the first time I saw this movie, I didn't really like it that much.  I knew that I didn't hate it, but it was something that I didn't really care for at the time.<br />I decided to re-evaluate it after seeing P.T. Anderson's masterpiece, \\"Punch-Drunk Love.\\"  I fell in love with it immediately.  You know how all the critics were saying that seeing that movie really makes you want to re-evaluate Adam Sandler?  Well, I decided to do the opposite.  I was already impressed with Sandler long before that movie, so I decided to re-evaluate P.T. Anderson.  So, I decided to give \\"Magnolia\\" another chance.  And I am really glad, because this time around, I really enjoyed it.<br />The movie focuses around several different characters, who seem to have a connection somehow with one another.  It all takes place in the time frame of one day, and with that day comes revelations, strange situations, confessions, and redemption.  It's like a bunch of different stories, but they're all happening at the same time.  We keep going back from character to character.  Each character is either being troubled, hiding a dark secret, looking for some kind of redemption, running away from the past, or dying.  This film is about coincidence and chance; secrets and confessions; blame and forgiveness; sorrow and pain; and most importantly, redemption and rebirth.<br />There are so many different stars that were in this non-commercial film.  It really reminds you of the power that took place in Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  The cast includes such stars as Tom Cruise, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, Jason Robards, Julianne Moore, Jeremy Blackman, and many more.  They all do a fantastic job in this very difficult movie.<br />P.T. (Paul Thomas) Anderson is quite the writer/director.  He was able to make a very complex film that doesn't have to revolve around plot.  There isn't just one idea going around in the movie; there's dozens of them!  Each person who watches the movie is bound to take something different from it.  The writing and directing was really amazing.<br />The DVD has a few extras to offer.  Those extras are the \\"Frank T.J. Mackey seminar,\\" the Mackey infomercial, a teaser and theatrical trailer, TV spots, the \\"save me\\" music video, and a documentary of the making of \\"Magnolia\\" that is over 70 minutes long!  The picture quality was very crystal clear and the sound was very high quality.<br />Be warned, this is not a film that everyone is going to like.  If you do not have the time nor patience, then do not attempt this one.  The film is 3 HOURS LONG!  That's right: 3 HOURS LONG!  It's a very depressing and tragic movie, but it is done in such an impressive and unique way.  If you want a movie with a point that is very clear, a very identifiable plot, or a quickly paced story, skip it.  Don't even bother putting this in your DVD player, or VCR player.  This is a film that you will either love it, or you will hate it.  Just be warned.<br />I am glad that I took the time to revisit this film.  I really did enjoy it more the second time around.  I wasn't prepared for a 3 hour long and depressing tragedy when I watched it the first time awhile back.  Now, I was able to let it soak inside my mind and fully appreciate it for what it was.  This is not a commercial-friendly film; this is not a film that is going to be loved by the majority; but to those who do end up enjoying it will be rewarded big time.  Overall, \\"Magnolia\\" is about second chances.  I am glad that I did just that, and gave it a second chance.  Maybe this is a film that the more you see it, the more you appreciate it.  A very, VERY impressive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.ssive film from Mr. Anderson, indeed.
B000063V8S|5.0|After the splendid third season, which kept most people wanting more after the season finale, the fourth season rolled along smoothly with high expectations from viewers. The basis of \\"character-development over action\\" was greatly improved upon and put to more use here, even though there are some great action episodes. <br />The fourth season got to a tremendous start with many action-packed and essential episodes: <BR>1) \\"THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS, PART II. Like the first part, that episode has great music, action, acting, plot, and suspense. Although the first part os just a tad bit better, the second part has all you expect from a borg episode: Spaceship fights, good special effects, stuff exploding, phaser fights, etc. <BR>2) \\"REUNION.\\" (The second episode out of four in the Worf saga) After Sins of the Father, what I consider to be the first part in the rough quadrilogy involving Worf, came \\"REUNION,\\" which is even better than the first part. Worf's girlfriend comes back (along with his unexpected son) and so do many characters from the \\"SINS OF THE FATHER\\" as Worf must confront old enemies and try to gain back his honor. Directed by Jonathan Frakes, this episode has great special effects, good acting, and a great fight at the end. Bring on the third part!<BR>3) \\"REMEMBER ME.\\" A great episode which emphasizes on Dr. Crusher. Although this episode is not really known for its action, it does have cool concepts and great suspense.<br />After those ground-breaking episdoes, there were more character-based and humorous episodes.<br />1) \\"DATA'S DAY.\\" I can't say enough about how great this episode is. All of the characters have funny lines, Chief O'Brien gets married, and of course anything with DATA in the title has to be good.<BR>2) \\"BROTHERS.\\" Yet another Data episode, this brought back Lore and his creator, Noonien Singh. The chemistry between the characters is great in thie episode. Brent Spiner plays THREE roles, all on screen at the same time.<BR>3) \\"Q-PID.\\" Any episode with Q in the title has be good, and this one is great. The Trek crew goes on a Robin Hood adventure. Worf has some great lines in the episode.<BR>4) \\"THE MIND'S EYE.\\" A Trek remake of The Manchurian Candidate, this episode emphasizes on La Forge and shows he CAN say some great lines of dialogue besides techno-babble.<BR>5) \\"FAMILY.\\" Here we meet Worf's adoptive parents and Picard's brother. Some great scenes in this episode, especially the mud fight between Picard andhis brother.<BR>6) \\"THE NTH DEGREE.\\" This episdoe features Lt. Barclay in antoerh humorous episode, though it's a bit more complicated that the last Barclay episode.<BR>7) \\"IN THEORY.\\" This is (another) a great Data episode. Basically, he puruses a relationship with a female officer aboard the Enterprise. A very funnny episode that shows that Data is NOT gay.<BR>8) \\"FINAL MISSION.\\" A great episode which bases on Wesely Crusher and Picard. Will Wheaton is great in this episode.<br />The season ended with a great cliffhanger: \\"REDEMPTION.\\" The third part in the Worf quadrilogy, this episdoe retunrs old characters from \\"SINS OF THE FATHER\\" and Worf conintues his quest to restore his family honor. Worf's brother also makes another appearance. Filled with great special effects, action, and acting, it will have you biting your nails until you get the second part on the fifth season gift set. Also features a great ending and a Tasha Yar connection through her alternate demise in \\"YESTERDAY'S ENTERPRISE.\\"<br />All in all, better than season 3 but will still be surpassed by season 5.<br />1990-1991; 21 hours; All episodes are rated PG for mild violence and brief language.

These are a few that came to my mind when I listened to the albulm not that they are bad names to be placed beside of but if you are trying to become your own person or prove that you have already then why should you have to copy the styles of others?

B00006LWSF|5.0|It is amazing how Emin3m has had an effect on me. At first, my mother, (im 13) would let me listen to him but only when she wasnt there... Until 8 Mile came ut. She has grown fond of Emin3m since I told her that he has a right to say what he says and if she has a problem just let it be. Eminem has gotten better with his songs ever since his first album, Infinite many years ago. I have all the Eminem Cd's and I think you should get them too. If my mother could grow fond of these Cd's i think you should have no problem doing the same.

0716703440|5.0|At 1279 pages - this is a heavy book! But rightly so as it is the definitive volume on the most weighty subject - gravity.<br />As John Archibald Wheeler tells in his book Geons, Black Holes and Quantum Foam, \\"In the summer of 1968 I suggested to my recent former students Charlie Misner... and Kip Thorne... that they write a book... It's time for a book that incorporates all the recent developments, one that emphasises the physics and not just the mathematics.\\"<br />\\"We talked about the length and coverage of the book, and the division of labor. A concise book of 200 pages or so, with six to eight chapters, ought to do it, we agreed. ...When any two of us said it was done, it would be done.\\"<br />\\"When [W. H. Freeman] brought out the book in 1973, it had 1,279 pages divided into nine sections and fourty-four chapters - and it offered two tracks through the forest. Naturally, we are happy that more than twenty eight years and more than 60,000 English-language copies later, Gravitation is still selling.\\" <br />I am happy too! Wheeler, Thorne and Misner recently reviewed, and rejected a request to revise and reissue the book, so look for this classic to become scarce as it has been some time since its last printing.

B000002J1L|5.0|Released in 1971 with Genesis taking up it's beloved classic line-up, Nursery Cryme is the album where Phil Collins first showcased his talent both on the drums and is also where Collins took lead vocals for the first time, not on Selling England By The Pound. The production of this CD is absolutely atrocious but the remastering does help Nursery Cryme a lot and sounds vastly superior to the older version. I must say that the album front cover sleeve with the striped field and the nurse playing tee ball, showcases the schizophrenic and psychotic mood of the LP. 1971 was one of the years of the golden era of prog-rock and Genesis were among the top bands of that style of rock and there's plenty of it on Nursery Cryme. Genesis in fact, never abandoned their prog-rock roots, even with their heavily polished, squeaky clean production of their 1983 self-titled debut and Invisible Touch as well as We Can't Dance and even Calling All Stations. There is no radio-friendly material on here but what there is is 7 tracks of sheer beauty with bizarre production with some of the strangest lyrics that Peter Gabriel has ever written. I might come into confrontations with those purists who can't seem to like any of the LPs Phil Collins at lead vocals, however, even I sometimes think about where Genesis would've gone if Steve Hackett had stayed but nonetheless, Genesis were among the most consistent bands of all time. Return of The Giant Hogweeds is a standout cut. I just love the buzzing guitar chord changes in the beginning of it and it&iexcl;¦s menacing musicianship and Gabriels fierce storytelling vocals and it truly showcases it&iexcl;¦s theme. It&iexcl;¦s an epic tale of giant plants that escapes from captivity to wreak terrible revenge on the human race and the guitars and organs are amazing! The other standout cut is For Absent Friends as it&iexcl;¦s where Phil Collins for the first time in his career, sings on lead vocals. While his voice was a bit mousey at that point, the song is a beautiful, simple, & acoustic ballad. The only thing that keeps this track from being great is that it&iexcl;¦s less than two minutes long! As much as this CD is great, I must honestly admit that the muddy production as well as it's short playing time of only 39 minutes does keep this from being an essential recording like Genesis latter material compared with Foxtrot or Selling England By The Pound. For the fan base whose tastes are mostly confined to the Phil Collins-era LPs, Nursery Cryme may not be an easy album to get into easily, even for those who loved Wind & Wuthering or Trick Of The Tail but even for those ppl, I do recommend trying NC for something different as Genesis are like a chameleon band. Despite all the cons, Nursery Cryme is a wonderful record that is one worthy of checking out even if it turns out not being all that appreciating. Sure it may not have gotten noticed at the time of it&iexcl;¦s release but guess what, it&iexcl;¦s still in print after 31 years!  An enduring classic that is not quite an essential but definitely one worthy of checking out.  Foxtrot and the two after it though have more edge to them than this one does and all of Genesis albums should be in your collection&iexcl;K..And I&iexcl;¦m not talking about just Peter Gabriel&iexcl;¦s LPs with them either&iexcl;K..Pick up the Turn It On Again: The Hits CD too! ºple, & acoustic ballad.

1881273156|5.0|Whilst I am currently single, I have been on a search for a partner this year.  In somewhat of a state of confusion in a 2-month relationship, I was recommended this book to help me understand the man I was dating.  I was feeling that his &quot;heart wasn't in it&quot; &amp; I couldn't work out how we could be in a relationship without emotional involvement.  We both seemed to want the same things.  When I suggested that to him, he was terribly hurt as he thought he was acting in a loving manner.  <BR>After reading this book, I now know why.  We were speaking different love languages &amp; I wasn't receiving what he was sending.  <BR>This book has changed the way I think about all of my relationships - intimate, family, friends, even flatmates!  I recommend this book to everyone - those married recently, those single, those married for a long time, those with children - in fact, I can't imagine someone not getting something out of this book.<BR>The book is an easy &amp; hugely beneficial read &amp; will no doubt impact your life as much as it did mine.<BR>Enjoy reaping the benefits!
B00006V9A0|3.0|The reason why I am ging this three stars is for several reasons.<BR>First off, on the record I was never a big fan of Nirvana, simply put, I just never 'got' them. There were countless other alternative band's from the early 90's that I loved, Chili Pepper's, Jane's Addiction, The Pixie's, Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, a band that got better with each release, even Dave Grohl's Foo Fighter's, these were band's that I 'got' and loved, but Nirvana? As much as I recognize thet they were an influential<BR>band in the sense that they were responsible for bringing Alternative Rock to the masses. As much as I recognize that Kurt Cobian was a talented songwriter. I never emotionaly connected with them. I feel that the mythology of Kurt Cobain has grown out of porportion to the reality of his life and talent. Comparisons to John Lennon was always a little overkill for me. I also have to admit that some of my bias has to do with Kurt Cobain's suicide. My very mixed feelings with how he betrayed his ideals with that senseless act.<br />Having said all that and in all fairness, what about this new compliation? What I like is the fact that it is in Chronological order, other than the fact that 'You Know You're Right' opens the CD. I feel that you get a better sense of a band's progression when you hear their single's in order. The packaging is nicely done, although it's strange that someone like Everett True wasn't asked to write the liner notes, since he was a friend<BR>of Kurt Cobain and a huge alternative rock critic. But David Fricke does a good job either way. This compilation is geared towards people who have never owned a Nirvana CD, covers all the highlights, from their Sub Pop days to Nevermind and In Utero. Some of Kurt's songs are excellent, 'Smells Like Teen Spirit, Lithium and All Apologies' will remain timeless. Yet for myself, some of his material was very uneven, I could never get into 'Pennyroyal Tea'.<br />Nice choice closing with two Unplugged tracks, 'All Apologies' and Bowie's 'The Man Who Sold The World', very apt choice for that band at the time in playing the Bowie song. As much as many Nirvana fans will be outraged by this assessment, this is where I stand.
B00005JKBC|3.0|A curiously uninvolving spy flick, possibly because Redford is way past his prime and occupies far too much screen time. Pitt isn't bad as a young spy learning the game. It is not clear to me why this particular film was made, however. It has absolutely no relevance in this post-Cold War era. Older audiences might find it more edifying.
0800179501|5.0|Besides the fact that Ralph Macchio is so hot this movie is awesome!  Its got action, love, comedy...everthing!  The love story between Ali and Daniel is so cute and nice and the fighting between the groups is intense and hard core!  THis movie RULES!
B00005JL78|3.0|The original short story needed some expanding to turn it into a two-hour movie, of that there is no question. So the plot gets a little complicated, but there's nothing wrong with that. But the last half hour plays like a dream, or a very odd joke. Up until then the film is reasonably suspenseful and fascinating to look at. Cruise is in his MISSION IMPOSSIBE rather than his MAGNOLIA mode, which means he is simply playing his good old matinee self. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Spielberg has done much better, of course. But this is what the man is turning out today, so you either go with it or you don't.
B00006G8HX|4.0|As Kirk said in Generations. But I have one question to ask. Where's the director's edition? After <BR>all, this is a great movie, and the clean up and 5.1 sound is awsome. But why is this only a special edition? The extra features are great, but where are the deleated scenes? Espically the one where Kirk confronts Bones in the elevator. It's little scene's like this that made ST II:TWOK(directors edition) awsome. <BR>This is a must buy for any Trek fan, but I hope Paramount give the rest of the movies a director's edition(espically ST:Generations, put back the lost opening). But all in all this is still a great movie to watch.
B00006IUL7|3.0|Pacino is a lot better than he has been in his last three or four (or five or six) films. Robin Williams is not bad as a killer, but frankly any number of actors could have played the part. Kevin Spacey comes to mind. The movie really centers around Pacino and his slow disintegration as a corrupt cop who is staring wide-eyed at the end of his particular road. The ending is silly and predictable and reminds us we are watching a movie. But it is pretty good fun up until then. Not in the same league with the director's previous effort, INSOMNIA, but more digestible for a mass audience.
B00006HBUA|3.0|Scooby-Doo as a live action flick is an intriguing idea, and in many ways this film faithfully recreates the world of the 1960's cartoon. But overall, it made me want to turn it off and put in the original cartoon instead.<br />What this film does right is the sets, costuming and props. They all have to perfect mix of the cartoon and the real world. It really feels like the world of Scooby-Doo could exist somewhere. Also, the performance by Matthew Lillard as Shaggy is dead-on. He is perfect in the role. Also the voice of Scooby is dead-on as well, but unfortunately all the other actors are not quite the same.<br />Freddy Prinze's Fred is very much off. It didn't seem like him at all. Daphne was too quirky for her own good, and Velma's characterization was close, but no cigar. Perhaps most disappointing was the CGI Scooby, who was too cartoony next to the real actors. The lighting on the CGI was always too bright for conditions, and over-all provided a distraction.<br />The story also seemed to drag halfway through, like it was a plot for a half-hour cartoon stretched into a feature length film (which it basically is). It just seems like the stories of Scooby-Doo are better suited for short cartoons. The film could have avoided this, however, if it had given an origin story, telling how the crew of Mystery Inc. first got together.<br />This film is worth seeing for Lillard's awesome Shaggy performance, but otherwise stick to the original cartoon.
B00005JKED|4.0|The film is pretty powerful stuff, thanks to Denzel Washington's first-rate performance as a thuggish, absolutely corrupt cop. The high point of the movie, however, involves Ethan Hawke and a room full of toughs who have been paid to murder Hawke. How Hawke gets out from under this death sentence is typical Hollywood logic-stretching, but the claustrophobic sequence still makes makes for some pretty unnerving viewing. The ending is a bit of letdown, but is compensated for by Washington's acting prowess in every scene that goes before.
B00006FXB6|5.0|When I first heard the first four songs from this album I was stunned by the sheer talent and beauty and raw mix of music and lyric they contained. I've never heard of this band before, but I'm a fan for sure now. They aren't really head banger, they are just rock at it's finest and most pure. Buy this album and you'll become addicted, at the very least, to the first four songs. I promise, you won't be disappointed!!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|i really love this soundtrack. not only does eminem rap his heart out about living on the 8 mile and trying to get by every day, but obie trice and 50 cent do a great job for their first major album appearance. the song \\"8 mile road\\" has a great beat and \\"rabbit run\\" is straight rap. i love it and you should too.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Such an acquired taste as sigur ros is so often overlooked. I almost overlooked it myself. I was exposed to their second (arguably 3rd) CD (ageatis byrjun) a few months after it came out by a freind and i must admit it wasnt my favorite sound. However, a few months to a year later i fell in love with the album and sigur ros as a whole. I couldnt get their pseudo religous and otherwordly rythms out of my head. Their music now is more important to me than any other music ( and i do listen to quite a lot of music). Since i had acquired this love for music from people i had never met, from a place i have only dreamed about, i was more than psyced about the realease of this new album (())[sorry, i couldnt resist the utter nonsense in putting the album title in parentheses]. I quickly pre-ordered the cd when i first saw it on this website... i jsut recently obtained this piece of heaven and was more than dissapointed when i received the album and was shocked at how little it meant to me and that i couldnt beleive how un-moving the cd was. However, as i listened to it more and more i realized the complexity that could never be heard on first listen and how i had felt that way about their last album. As i listen to the cd now i can describe in words what i am feeling...the cd takes you not to another world they have created, but to one of your own. The absence of actual lyrics opens the gates to a self created heaven and not one created by some godly beings from another world. I feel as though i am taking from them when i listen to the cd and imagine another world and another place.<BR> As for the teknikal aspects: the closest thing i can compare the casing to is tool's lateralus... it has a white sleave with a hole that creates the () logo on front and a picture of a zombie like person walking o' so frankensteinishly on back ...and underneath there is a black and white picture that you see above (within the () logo). Within the cd is a semi-permeable booklet of similar pictures. The acual cd is full white with the () logo texteured on it.<BR> The songs are all unexplainably beautiful and must be heard and not talked about. however, i could understand how someone could not like sigur ros at all. There music is far from &quot;for everyone&quot;, the overall rating on this album is probably far from acurate on the average persons take on the album... almost everyone that has heard sigur ros loves them. however this number is few. <BR>  In all this cd is an acquiered taste that takes a little work and patients to understand (like the best things in life, for example: love). this cd is not a plyable backdrop that just displays the portrait of gut music, but is much deeper and takes us back to a time when music took actual feeling and talent (classical era).But i must reiderate that this cd is not for everyone, it is an intravert's wet dream... however it is only my opinion.. in the ambiguous words of thom yorke: <BR>                      &quot;i might be wrong&quot;
B00005T343|5.0|Writing this movie off as a senseless catalogue of horrors does a terrible injustice to it. In this version, Lecter is free and living in Tuscany, which automatically involves a shift in the tone of the film. No longer the caged animal, Dr. Lecter is living the high life in Florence as an expert in Medieval and Early Renaissance Literature. Lecter free is Lecter happy, and Anthony Hopkins admirably portrays his verve. I thought Julianne Moore portrayed an older, more world-weary, Clarice Starling with skill, and is by no means just a second-choice-after-Jodie-Foster. Foster's Starling was inexperienced, though promising. Moore shows the flowering of that promise superbly. Gary Oldman played as he always does, with a brilliant conviction. But enough, anyone can test the truth of this by viewing the movie.<br />What I thought was missing in previous reviews, and which spurred me to write this one, is an explanation for the violence of Hannibal. It was sufficient to turn many viewers' stomachs, and I'm not entirely sure that they were wrong, albeit one can see equally graphic video of *real live people* with the top of their head cut away while undergoing brain surgery--in some cases they are still conscious and talking! In the other cases, the cinematography shows very little. The disfiguring of Mason Verger is in blurry and shaky camera work, the attack on the nurse (referred to in Silence and played in video here) is entirely obscured by Lecter's back and the bodies of two orderlies, and the final end of Mason Verger is again primarily not seen, only enough is shown to give us an idea of the horror. That so many reacted so strongly suggests that Ridley Scott achieved his probable goal in showing us little, but making it seem like much more. The violence is not gratuitous, nor does it detract from the psychological aspects of the story, rather it allows us to delve into the psychology of Lecter as never before. Hannibal is Lecter's murderous fantasies made flesh, just as the equally mad Mason Verger nurses his plans of revenge by flesh-eating boars. In each case, these wealthy, cultured men seem to take their inspiration from their reading, and here's the irony in the previous reviews which decry Hannibal as an expression of everything that is wrong with American culture and cinema: Hannibal's violence comes straight from the classic literature and arts both he and Mason Verger live on. The analogy between the death of Rinaldo Pazzi and the end of Judas Iscariot is made explicit, but there are even more instances of literary borrowings. Adonis was killed by a man-eating boar, and even eating brains has literary precedent: Ugolino della Gherardesca, the Count of Donoratico, was of a Ghibelline family, but double-crossed them to raise the Guelphs to power in Pisa. When the Ghibellines seized control, he was dispatched to prison by Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini where he died. They both betrayed something, the Archbishop his acquantance, and the Count his country and family tradition, so Dante put them both in Cocytus in Canto XXXIII, where the Count was forever eating away at the brain of his treacherous friend. Thyestes may also be another model, in this case the Thyestian banquet is made even more ironic by the fact that Krendler is unaware of his self-cannibalization. This is the sort of stuff Lecter and Verger learned, and it's not ultimately unsurprising that they'd fashion their revenges and violence on classical models, which allows us insight into the way they think. Far from being less psychologically interesting than its predecessor, Hannibal becomes more so, because we are able to see their motivations made plain by each act of violence.<br />So, for those who are still offended, be careful not to look to closely at classic literature, Greek and Roman myth, the works of ancient historians, and don't ever attend the opera!<br />Ta ta.
B00006LWSF|5.0|This is the best cd in the word! My mom and I listened to it. I think she even liked it. I was surprised. The best song on this soundtrack or cd is \\"Lose Yourself\\" by Eminem. That song deserves a grammy. Although, it's the number 1 song in the U.S.A. You should get this cd. It's one heck of a good cd. Trust me. It is. If you're not an Eminem fan, then you are weird. You should be. This soundtrack even features Macy Gray and bie Trice on it. So come. What are ya waitin' for? Go get it now!<br />Dear Parents: As you may notice, this album contains EXPLICIT LYRICS and CONTENT. Please think before letting kids listen to this album. Thanks
B00005T343|5.0|Writing this movie off as a senseless catalogue of horrors does a terrible injustice to it. In this version, Lecter is free and living in Tuscany, which automatically involves a shift in the tone of the film. No longer the caged animal, Dr. Lecter is living the high life in Florence as an expert in Medieval and Early Renaissance Literature. Lecter free is Lecter happy, and Anthony Hopkins admirably portrays his verve. I thought Julianne Moore portrayed an older, more world-weary, Clarice Starling with skill, and is by no means just a second-choice-after-Jodie-Foster. Foster's Starling was inexperienced, though promising. Moore shows the flowering of that promise superbly. Gary Oldman played as he always does, with a brilliant conviction. But enough, anyone can test the truth of this by viewing the movie.<br />... An explanation for the violence of Hannibal. It was sufficient to turn many viewers' stomachs, and I'm not entirely sure that they were wrong, albeit one can see equally graphic video of *real live people* with the top of their head cut away while undergoing brain surgery--in some cases they are still conscious and talking! In the other cases, the cinematography shows very little. The disfiguring of Mason Verger is in blurry and shaky camera work, the attack on the nurse (referred to in Silence and played in video here) is entirely obscured by Lecter's back and the bodies of two orderlies, and the final end of Mason Verger is again primarily not seen, only enough is shown to give us an idea of the horror. That so many reacted so strongly suggests that Ridley Scott achieved his probable goal in showing us little, but making it seem like much more. The violence is not gratuitous, nor does it detract from the psychological aspects of the story, rather it allows us to delve into the psychology of Lecter as never before. Hannibal is Lecter's murderous fantasies made flesh, just as the equally mad Mason Verger nurses his plans of revenge by flesh-eating boars. Ineach case, these wealthy, cultured men seem to take their inspiration from their reading, and here's the irony in the previous reviews which decry Hannibal as an expression of everything that is wrong with American culture and cinema: Hannibal's violence comes straight from the classic literature and arts both he and Mason Verger live on. The analogy between the death of Rinaldo Pazzi and the end of Judas Iscariot is made explicit, but there are even more instances of literary borrowings.

B000002LQR|5.0|I've been a chili pepper's fan for quite a long time. About two years ago I got into a lot of old 60s music, and just thought that no other music era or recent artist could possibly compare to the fathers of rock n' roll. So I took another listen to Blood Sugar, Sex Magik, and i just thought it was the greatest thing in the world. I realized that this easily compares to the works of artists such as Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon, and BSSM reflects the influence that these artists had on the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  Every song on it is amazing.  The diversity is mindboggling, from, \\"I Could Have Lied\\" to songs like \\"Suck My Kiss\\".  In my opinion \\"Give it Away\\" is one of the weakest songs on this album. Anthony Keidis vocals are spectacular, using the funky low voice for \\"Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik\\" and \\"If You Had To Ask\\", reminiscent of his older days, in the 1980s. \\"Breaking The Girl\\" truly shows the range in Anthony's vocals. Now for John, Flea, and Chad.  Any music with musicians of this stature and talent, has got to be great. John really proves his guitar masturfulness in songs such, as \\"Under the Bridge\\" and the obviously Hendrix influenced \\"My Lovely Man\\".  Flea comes on strong with smooth bass lines on \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\", and slap bass on \\"Naked in the Rain\\".  Well to sum it up I would have to say that this is the most amazing CD that i have ever heard.  There is something about it, that i don't think that chili peppers could ever re-create.
0385335482|2.0|I must admit that I'm a snob for these &quot;queen for a day&quot; type books.  They're quick and enjoyable.  This story was a fairytale, a cute plot, kept me reading (thus the two stars).  However, the end was rushed and not thought out well.  So she gets a new job and her life turns around.  Does she just forget about her old job and work?  There's no conclusion.  She literally dumps her past, and pays it away.  After dragging on about this woman's shopping disease and all of the problems it causes, to have it wrap up so swiftly and unthoughtfully is a waste to this potentially sweet story.
0316096199|5.0|Having read Alice Sebold's debut novel, The Lovely Bones, I felt compelled to read her memoir. Glad I did. Lucky is one of the most thought provoking and poignant memoirs I have ever read. I admire this author's willingness to bare her soul and share the pain of having been a victim of a brutal rape to the world. I am deeply moved by how this woman's life changed after such a grueling experience. Her strength and bravery are truly admirable. I read this memoir in two sittings. I recommend everyone to read this wonderful book.
B00005U2JL|5.0|This is the first time that Manson has done an official DVD and it rocks. It shows what it was actually like at the real concert. There are a few differences in performances. Ex: The intro had him come out in a carrage (only done for 1 show, not the whole tour) and \\"The Love Song\\" has him dressed like an abbot (which he actually wore that oufit during \\"Valentine's Day\\" at most shows) instead of him standing on a large podium probably because it was too similar to \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\" The DVD's intent was to bring out the best of Guns, God, and Government, and it does just that. Before I couldn't wait for Manson to go on tour again, and the DVD just made me even more impatient. The DVD Rocks!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I cannot even begin to tell you how amazing this woman truly is.  This CD is by far the best female effort this year.  There is definately something for everyone.  I have never been a huge fan of Christina but it's safe to say now that I am already looking forward to the next installment of this adventure.  From the very word go Can't Hold Us Down, a woman's anthem, get us going all the way to I'm O.K. a heartbreaking account of childhhod with a strong ending of having overcome this CD can't do any wrong.  I hope that even the worst of Christina's critics (myself once included) give this record just one shot....I know that you won't be let down!!!
B00007BK2N|5.0|I saw this film recently and thoroughly enjoyed every moment.  If you are an afficiando of the Manchester sound or early techno you will cherish this.  This film brings to life the incredible sights and sounds you would have experienced at that time in  England. It is one of those rare movies that are so much fun to watch you lose track of time all together, and when it ends you only want more. I can't wait to get this gem in my collection!
B00006LLNU|4.0|Sigur Ros is an exceedingly strange band. These mystery boys from Iceland specialize in slowly gushing mood music that sounds like nothing else on Earth and sing in their own imaginary language, so you'll need patience in penetrating their world. This particular CD contains not one piece of information besides the band's name. The album has no title, nor do any of the songs (the song titles that appear in the CD's buying info here and at other websites appear to be unofficial placeholders supplied by the frustrated record company). Hence the band is accused of being pretentious and overly artsy. Another difficulty is that imaginary language, known as \\"Hopelandic,\\" that is seen by some critics as the ultimate pretension with lyrics that are surely nonsense. However, I suspect that the band wishes to use the human voice as an instrument to such an extent that they don't want the constraint of trying to use non-melodious words just because they have meaning, so the sound of the voice rules supreme.<br />Given all that weirdness, this album is a never-ending atmospheric dirge that can only be penetrated by repeated listening and an open mind. Lush and coldly dramatic arrangements ebb and flow, sometimes accompanied by drum \\"beats\\" that are often so impossibly slow that they merely become another part of the soundscape, rather than any sort of rhythm. The eight \\"songs,\\" which have an average length of almost nine minutes, segue into each other so seamlessly that it's pointless to worry about where one ends and the next one begins. In fact, it's probably only a matter of time before Sigur Ros releases an album that is one giant 70 minute-long composition. Winners are track #3 which is built around a very lovely piano melody, and track #4 which is the most song-like piece on the album, even possessing some structure and a discernible rhythm. Track #8 contains the best atmospherics on the album before morphing unexpectedly into a huge mega-rock freakout to wrap up the disc. The losers include track #5, an agonizingly sluggish dirge that, except for a dramatic but brief climax, lurches along more slowly than continental drift. Track #7, at thirteen minutes, is an attempt at an epic full of violent mood swings, moving abruptly between very quiet and very loud passages, but only comes across as disjointed, clumsy, and bombastic.<br />If you're familiar with any of Sigur Ros' previous albums, especially the great *Agaetis Byrjun* from 2000, you'll find that this one is another solid indicator of the band's basic plan, but with less variety as the band wrings out the rough edges in their quest for a lush and seamless musical soundscape. Welcome to the world of Sigur Ros - and what a strange world it is..

B000060MWU|4.0|I have this DVD in the local release, in Australia, I'm not sure if there is region-coding but it certainly is in PAL so you will need the capacity to playback in PAL. The Australian release contains a lengthy interview extra with Lynch, Badalamenti, and a number of other people involved in production, and goes into some detail regarding the music, which was nice, including on location footage from Prague. It is in anamorphic widescreen and the image and sound are good, but not excellent.  It's also quite cheap.<BR>I have seen a copy of the Canadian version here, and it was disappointing (esp. compared to other Canada-only releases such as Cronenberg's \\"eXistenZ\\") ... it has virtually no extras and, much worse, THE CANADIAN VERSION IS IN PAN&SCAN (4:3) FORMAT! What's with that?? This great film should be seen in the ratio which Lynch intended for it!<BR>P.S. The Australian release of Eraserhead is also excellent in terms of sound and picture, and is in 4:3, but it seems Lynch filmed it that way.
B0000028VT|4.0|The third album in the singer's catalog begins to show Carey's desire to be more accepted by the &quot;hip-hop&quot; generation, and that is cause for concern. While she is gifted with a magical set of pipes (and a killer bod, to boot), Mariah's decision to incorporate rap rhythms makes this one a kind of schizophrenic undertaking. She bounces for &quot;ing&eacute;nue&quot; to &quot;home girl&quot; in such a manner that she is somewhat musically confused.<br />The cut &quot;Dreamlover&quot; will be &quot;recycled&quot; in subsequent releases as &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Fantasy&quot;, and &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, respectively.<br />Also, this album began Carey's tendency to have THE INSPIRATIONAL ANTHEM, you know, the one that can be sung at any function, regardless of one's ethnicity, religion, or economic standing.<br />&quot;Hero&quot; is the song of choice here. That song will be done for years to come. We can either praise or condemn Carey for that, depending on our respective points of view.<br />Overall, however, the disc comes recommended for its contribution to female pop of the 90's.
B00006HBUC|4.0|Having been a long-time SD fan, I have long-awaited the time when it would finally have a live-action translation. The results couldn't be more delightful.<br />The film starts when the gang breaks up after Velma leaves when Freddy takes all the credit. The gang is reunited two years later for the same mission; to help investigate a long-abandoned amusement park ride on an island. After finding out that they can't solve the mystery on their own, they finally realize that they worked much better as a team.<br />The film is no more than a frentic, high-paced live action-blending of the old Scooby cartoons with the recent direct-to-video movies. You'll be so distracted by all the madcap physical and sight gags that you'll hardly realize the movie's an hour and a half long.<br />The casting here is perfect, but Matthew Lilliard stands out as his remarkable, utterly believable turn-in as Scooby's gluttonous goateed friend, Shaggy. His performance is so good that it nearly overshadows the other three. Without Lilliard, the movie wouldn't be as nearly as delightful and the discreet pot jokes would probably be more obvious than ever.<br />Don't get me wrong, Linda Cardenelli turns in an equally delightful, yet somehow less satisfying turn in her first major film-starring role as Velma Dinkley. Freddie Prinze Jr. and his new wife, Sarah Michelle Gellar, do equally fine jobs as the snotty pretty boy Freddy and the eternal damsel-in-distress Daphne Blake.<br />Although it's implied drug references and some over-the-top physical gags may turn some mainstream viewers off, the film has a slick sense of style and will appeal to most SD fans. To those who haven't seen a single SD cartoon (such as film critics Roger Ebert and James Beradinelli) may be turned off or be ovrwhelmed by the quick cuts, frenetic pace and genial silly plot.<br />However, if you're in the mood for something amusing and kid-friendly for your kids, 'Scooby Doo' is the place to go.<br />Rated PG for rude humor, drug references, brief language and cartoon violence.
B0000027RL|5.0|With Pearl Jam now more than a decade into their career as rock superstars, you'd think they'd have released something more sophisticated and altogether better than their initial surprise hit that caught on at the end of 1991. While all their albums since TEN have been more complex and more subtle, they have not necessarily surpassed this classic grunge record. It all depends on your preference. However, I simply cannot find enough real substance or unique sound in Pearl Jam's newer work to justify their alienation of this great sound.<br />First of all, for those who argue that NEVERMIND is hands-down better than this CD, it is true that TEN probably wouldn't have made it without Nirvana breaking into the mainstream at the same time. While I think NEVERMIND is a great record, too, I have to say that I prefer this CD for pure quality of music (NEVERMIND, of course, wins for significance and influence in rock history). Of the eleven tracks that make up TEN, every single one is not only enjoyable, it is different enough from the others that you don't feel like you're being cheated into hearing the same message and melody with different production techniques (a feeling we're getting an awful lot of nowdays). Subject matter ranges from relationships gone bad to damaging childhood experiences to philosophical matters, which is something current commerical bands like Nickelback, Default, TRUSTcompany, New Found Glory, etc., etc. cannot claim, no matter how many ways they can think of to whine about their \\"girl problems.\\"<br />While all the songs on the album are more than worth listening to, my personal top five would have to be...<br />1. Even Flow<BR>2. Garden<BR>3. Black<BR>4. Jeremy<BR>5. Alive<br />It's not my very favorite album of all time, but it's in the top 10 or 15. In 1993, Pearl Jam began to switch into a self-indulgent/overly artsy mode with \\"Vs.\\" (a decent, respectable album nonetheless), but anything from \\"Vitalogy\\" (1994) forward just doesn't do it for me. If you're looking for the select few later PJ songs that may be worth downloading, I would describe \\"Daughter,\\" \\"Dissident,\\" \\"Rearviewmirror,\\" \\"Corduroy,\\" and \\"Nothing as it Seems\\" as being worthy of your time.<br />If you're a teenager/high school student like myself and are sick of hearing the same old drone of the manufactured nu-metal and \\"alt-rock\\" stars of 2002 (Nickelback, Default, and Staind being the most guilty out of the year's top sellers), go back and check out some of their influences. Let's just hope that a group as original and insightful as one of these original \\"Gen-X\\" bands (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Smashing Pumpkins) comes along and ends ...low-quality...bands that have dominated the \\"scene\\" for several years.

B0000542D1|5.0|History was born with the opening chord of the Beatles' first movie.  As the title track is playing, hordes of screaming young girls chase the Beatles through the train station, cutting back and forth to a man's attempts to open a milk carton, Paul and his grandfather calmly waiting the storm out, and finally all the Beatles escaping aboard the train.<br />The musical numbers demonstrate spontaneity of bursting into song \\"I Should Have Known Better\\" and \\"I'm Happy Just To Dance With You.\\"  They are just plain enjoying themselves.  And \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" featuring their antics on the grass pitch, can be construed as the first ever music video.  The aerial camera angles, the guys clowning around, and the speeded up camera shots add to the fun.  \\"And I Love Her\\" is highlighted by the light effect around Paul's face at the end of the number.  First, half his face is shaded, the other in light.  The camera swings to a profile shot, first flooding his face so it can't be seen, then fading to a thin corona, making an eclipse effect.  Great cinematography work there.<br />The press conference has Paul's repeated answers:  \\"No, we're just good friends,\\" plus John's witty remark to how they found America:  \\"Turn left at Greenland.\\"<br />Ringo's misadventures when he goes out parading is also of worthy mention.  and even establishes a brief but good rapport with Charlie, the boy who's playing hookie from school.  The scene in the cafe is good as well.<br />George has a great moment in a scene demonstrating how mass marketing and teen trends are set.  I kind of wonder if this is how things still work today.<br />Other great moments:  a Keystone cops-inspired chase scene, the carjacker, George showing Shake how to shave, John playing in the bath--believe me, there are so many scenes worth mentioning it'd be impossible to list them all--the movie's THAT good.<br />Of the two schoolgirls in the train, the blonde is Patty Boyd, later to be George Harrison's first wife, later to marry Eric Clapton.  David Langton, the actor in the dressing room reacting to John's long beard, is best known as Lord Bellamy in Upstairs Downstairs.  Lionel Blair, the choreographer of the \\"Tell Me Why\\" dance routine, appeared in Absolute Beginners as Harry Charms.  Richard Vernon, the stuffy newspaper reading man aboard the train, had many roles in TV, including Yes Minister.  And the tall gangly man jumping up and down in the club with Ringo is Jeremy Lloyd, one of the co-creators of Are You Being Served? (!)<br />Other supporting characters include Norm, as their bossy, height-challenged PR man who's fighting a war of nerves with John, and Shake, his towering but unassertive assistant on whom he takes out his frustrations.  Shake tells him, \\"John hasn't got any [nerves]\\"  Norm:  \\"That's just the trouble.\\"<br />But let's not forget Wilfrid Brambell as Paul's \\"clean\\" grandfather, who's got a wily look in his eye.  He's an instigator, all right, stirring things up, \\"a mixer,\\" as Paul calls him.  The scene where he gets more chips after he goes broke at the gambling club shows how foxy he can be.  He successful stirs up Ringo, nearly sabotaging the live performance.<br />The final music montage featuring \\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"If I Fell,\\" \\"I Should've Known Better,\\" and \\"She Loves You\\" demonstrates the triumph of the Beatles.  And look at the hysterical to love-stricken faces of their feminine audience!  What an effect they had on their fans!<br />The rock movie would not have been possible without this day in the life of the Beatles movie.

B00003CX8J|5.0|It's the future, and an evil genius named Magneto controls the fate of mankind.  The only ones standing in his way are the X-MEN, a superhuman group of wayward transexuals in black spandex catsuits who rail against the messengers of doom and injustice.

6305291500|5.0|1980's profane. Flash or two of nudity, handled well. Dialog sometimes crude, suggestive but not too lewd unless you know Swedish. Nice story, not for pre-teens... or teens at all IMO.  I was proud to spy the WTC's Twin Towers on the DVD case label of this edition. I hope they keep producing it in this era of post-9/11 political correctness. 2015 Update: my original review was for the older letterboxed release. The PC police removed the Twin Towers from the 20th Ann. Edition case artwork after all, boo hiss on the producers.  Period piece: John Candy, young Tom Hanks, pre-Kill Bill Daryl Hannah, WTC, &#34;sexy&#34; dialog. Worth having.

B00005JLEU|2.0|(*****) Theoretically... But this is the Disney-ized USA release of the original Japanese version. For comparison I have viewed a probably gray-market DVD of the original Japanese version with English subtitles.<br /><br />Every time I watch the original, it transports me to a refreshingly different, non-Western, faraway mind-state; quite unexpected at first, but eerily enjoyable. The artwork is lush and layered with detail that emerges only with repeated viewings.<br /><br />BUT... After a second viewing of the US theatrical release, I found myself increasingly disliking Disney's treatment. Chihiro's blossoming strength and courage (the whole point of the movie!) becomes inexplicable, for Disney has her now constantly mooning over Haku, and being mother-henned by Lin.<br /><br />Entire plot elements and dialog are unnecessarily messed with, and cheap shots, insults and inappropriate humor are added. Disney is determined that Chihiro/Sen stay a dependent kid in the Bathhouse, rather than become a peer to her coworkers, and who can hold her own in a strange world.<br /><br />As for Disney's releasing it as \\"Miyazaki's Spirited Away\\", are Uncle Walt's kids humbly proclaiming the opportunity to present a work by animation's true Grand Master, or are they hastily disclaiming responsibility for such an alien, un-Disney oddity? Perhaps with Studio Ghibli breaking away (as of 2005) from Tokuma Shoten, future foreign releases of Miyazaki's works will get gentler, more respectful treatment.<br /><br />[comment Nov. 2012: I gather that John Lassiter, head honcho at Pixar, championed the whole Miyazaki initiative--possibly over objections & complaints from Disney management. Lassiter personally introduces each of the early Disney-Ghibli releases, showing his love for Miyazaki's art as well as his towering ego. But all media players have a Fast Forward feature, thank goodness.]<br /><br />I'd encourage viewers to stick to the Japanese track on this DVD, with directly translatedsubtitles, and compare for themselves. They just aren't the same story.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|This hit-heavy soundtrack to the Tom Hanks prison drama makes all the right moves.  If you enjoyed the \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" album, \\"8 Mile\\" is for you.  Highly recommended!

B00005JL96|5.0|One of the best animated films in some time. This should become a classic. A whole-lot-of-shaking-going-on.
B00006IU73|5.0|Yes I'm new to this band, so I can't tell you how this disc compares to their previous releases.  The quick-and-dirty take on these guys is that they are Yes for the new millennium, with a darker mood and a metal edge.  But there's lots more to them than that.  What stands out about them is how they juxtapose so many different elements, over the course of the CD, and in individual songs.  You might hear bits that remind of Pink Floyd or Sense Field, and guitar solos that bring to mind Jeff Beck or Alan Holdsworth.  You'll find beautiful ballads punctuated by metal riffs, futuristic mechanical noises, full-on instrumental metal romps, mesmerizing storytelling, and a hymnlike closer.  This album will transport you from your day-to-day world. Intriguing, irresistible, highly recommended.
055321263X|5.0|We all remember the dry, boring classics we were forced to read and dissect in literature class. The Woman in White is definitely not one of them. Sure, it is, in the style of other Victorian-esque novels, rather frilly and verbose, but it is immensely better than the cheap one-layer mystery movies of the present-day. One of the things that makes it interesting is that it is told from many points of view, and delves deep into each character. It is about impersonation and greed, and features a character that is noble-looking but cruel, a character that is ugly but smart(unlike many antagonists that seem to be equipped with both beauty, brains, and an ability to find clues that are scarcely there), a character that is beautiful but stale, and a drawing tutor that just happened to wander into all of this when, one day, he unknowingly helped a lady clad all in white escape from a mental institution in the middle of the night.
B00006SFLV|4.0|When seen in order, these 19 episodes form an amazingly rich chronicle of a year in the lives of Angela Chase, her high school friends and the adults in their lives. Writing this great rarely makes it into series television. As disappointing as it was when the show was cancelled after one year, the result was a self-contained almost novelistic tapestry of interwoven stories that stands alone as one of the finest depictions of adolescence and parenthood ever created for the screen. One of the most distictive threads that runs through the series is the way both children and adults deceive themselves about what they really want and need out of life. The drama and humor of the series often revolves around the struggle of the different characters to break through to their genuine selves. Among many fine story lines, one standout is that of Rickie Vasquez, probably the first depiction of a gay teen on series television, and if not the first, certainly the most unapologetic. I could go on way too long about all the other moving, surprising, heartbreaking and ironic story lines, about the way characters are always surprising us with unexpected depths or insights or abilities, about the use of music, about the incredibly honest and unexploitative depiction of teenage sexuality, and about the performance of A.J. Langer, the only adult playing a teen-ager and doing it stunningly. Best of all the show is so rich and crafted so brilliantly that it rewards repeated viewing, so you can take out your DVD's every year or two and find new things to enjoy and revisit your favorite moments.<br />Update after viewing the DVD's: The quality of the tranfer (or the production of the discs)is not the greatest, certainly not what we've come to expect from this format. On my set, there's  a lot of streaking of bright points in the frame. The original always had a 'soft' quality that was a part of the show's look, but this set should have been more carefully produced. For that reason I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars.
0451527046|3.0|It had a great plot, it just wasn't narrated in a very captivating way. I finished it, but had to force myself to keept reading, keeping in mind that it might get better. I just don't get it---the tale of Jim Hawkins, who goes off to sea, and uncovers a conspiracy involving one of the people on the ship, intense fight sequences and stealthy hiding---it should be great. But I found it a drag.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road wasn't the final album released, but it was the last one made.  It is the departure for the band and it leaves you with words to live by from John, Paul, George and even Ringo.  Granted the worst song on the album was &quot;Octopus' Garden&quot;, but it's quite good for Ringo.  &quot;Come Together&quot; is a great hard rock song that you can learn a lesson from, great musically and lyrically.  &quot;Something&quot; is a beautiful George song, and definetly one of his best, if not the best.  Although &quot;Here Comes The Sun&quot; is a beautiful song by George also.  &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is probably the most out of place song on the album, but every album has one, and i think it's a great song, and great music too.  &quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is good slow song that has a nice midsection by Paul and is a great song for their final album.  &quot;Because&quot; is very nice, and seems like it should have been on Sgt. Pepper, but works great just the same on Abbey Road.  The rest of the songs like &quot;She Came In Through The Bathroom Window&quot;, &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard&quot;, &quot;Sun King&quot;, and such are great songs to end with, very musically charged, and odd lyrically wise, but in a good way.  &quot;The End&quot; is the absolute perfect song to end the album with... even though &quot;Her Majesty&quot; actually finishes it off, but you get the idea.  It is great musically and everyone has a great part in it.  And after all the love you take is equal to the love you make.
6305265488|5.0|I'm usually not the type of person who will watch a movie advertised as &quot;a modern-day Cinderella story&quot;...I mean, c'mon, Cinderella is such a wimp, crying and waiting for the fairy godmother to come and rescue her, and being pushed around by those stepsister's. But, I assure you, Drew Barrymore's Danielle is no such girl. She has backbone, and strength, and charm, too. The characters are played by great actors, and have more depth than in the traditional legend. It manages to be romantic but not sappy, as well as gut-splittingly funny.

B00006CXXU|5.0|A leap from her self titled debut album, Christina releases \\"Stripped\\", an album of self discovery and revelation.  She has definitley grown up, away from the stereotype of pop that Britney cast on pop music.  The album is a mix of many musical genres, not just pop.  She goes rock n roll with \\"Im a Fighter\\" and hiphop to \\"Dirrty\\" amongst others.  Her collaboration with Alicia Keys, Linda Perry, Glen Ballard and others add a certain maturity to Christina's powerful vocals. (Although I have to admit, she sounds like Pink in some tracks).  Her ballad \\"Soar\\" would make Mariah and Whitney proud, while the spunk of \\"Dirrty\\" can make Janet and Madonna smile.  You can never find Britney or any other bubble gum singer sing such a song that is so revelaing and can leave you emotionally vulnerable, but Christina wears it like a scar.  Five stars is not enough for \\"Stripped\\".  Go ahead, buy it, its ceratinly worth your money.

0679437223|2.0|Although literate, accessible, and sometimes brilliantly written, the characters' lack of humanity blunt the force of Heller's satire. Ironic that a novel so beloved by the Sixties' generation contains no real individuals, just a batch of comically drawn stick figures cascading down an endless mudslide of absurdity. <br />Yossarian is a bore. A hero in his own right for having flown so many dangerous missions, he runs away from heroism to become an epic-slacker and whiner. It could be said that this slacking and whining is how Yossarian's dread of flying missions manifests itself. But could an airman, a bombadier who has seen and inflicted and endured so much suffering really act as he does, even given the book's absurd context? While Catch-22's fans may see him as an anti-hero, I see him simply as an anti-human.<br />The real disappointment for me, however, was that the book was not even sporadically funny. I've laughed out loud at the best of them--Twain, Wodehouse, Evelyn Waugh--and nothing, not one single scene comes within puking distance of these masters. The mediocre Marx Brothers patter, the Keatonesque knockabout, and the ante-Stranglove absurdity are all recognizable and should amount to something--but they don't. It is like sitting through a four hour stand-up comedy routine where a skilled and ingenious performer does everything including painting his genitalia green and none of it adds up to funny. In this sense, Heller is a skillful and often ingenious storyteller, but he is not a particularly funny one. <br />Okay, now that I've dumped on Heller and laid my curmudgeonly, sourpuss opinions out there for you all to see, is there somewhere else where you can read a funny book about WWII? Yes, most definitely: Evelyn Waugh's Sword of Honor trilogy. This book has everything working against its being funny: a dull central character (calling Guy Crouchback a hero would be a gross overstatement), a dreary, failed marriage, and lots of tedious training far from the heat of battle. But out of these unpromising situations, Waugh creates a story that is both uproarious and profoundly moving. Put his Apthorpe up against any of the martinet officers in Catch-22 and tell me who it is that makes you laugh the hardest. Yet, when Apthorpe dies unheroically in the second volume, I felt a sense of loss--something I never felt in Catch-22.
B000002MM8|5.0|This album is great. It is dark and haunting (I always think of a tomb when I listen to it). Tribal, celtic, hypnotic, erotic, eclectic, multi-layered, deep, beautiful. A fabulous album for those already familiar with this unique group, and a terrific introduction for those curious.<br />Definitely worth the buy. One of my favorite albums. You will want more...
0375751513|4.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray, by Oscar Wilde is a novel that explores the themes of human corruption, moral decadence and the value of youth in society. The novel follows the life of a narcissistic youth, Dorian Gray, who makes a Faustian pact with the devil to keep his youth. Dorian grows to love immorality and the darker joys of life. However, the evils of his life do not manifest within him but in his portrait.<br />Published in 1890, The Picture of Dorian Gray is still a popular choice of literature for society today, being praised as one of Wilde's greatest works. The appeals of The Picture of Dorian Gray to a modern day society are the plot, characters and Wilde's firm command of language. The novel deals with themes that are common in society, drugs, violence, immorality, social decadence and human corruption.<br />At times, Wilde's writing appears shallow and wooden, lacking any action. However, what is lost in action is gained in dialogue, which is exquisite and strongly reflects Wilde's own nature. The novel is riddled with finely wrought epigrams and witticisms that display the true skill and genius of Wilde as both an author and an orator.
6300216039|5.0|I borrowed this tape from my local library to compare it and the Baz version.  And I have to say this one wins hands down.  I had to read Romeo and Juliet in eighth grade.  And I really liked it then.  But I like it even better now.  Whiting and Hussey made an awesome Romeo and Juliet.  This version draws you in until you actually feel like your there in Verona.  It got to the point where I was laughing, crying, and shouting at the T.V.  Especially when Romeo passed the friar carrying the letter.  When I'll not let any more of the beans spill.  So here's my recomendation.  Rent, Borrow or Buy this version and you will not regret it.  It's a MUST see.

B00005JL78|5.0|This movie was great in every sense of the word.  Tom Cruise pulled off his role perfectly!  I love the way Spielberg makes people step back and take a look in the mirror and think if we are taking technology too far too prosecute individuals.  As also in Artificial Intelligence a misunderstood and underappreciated masterpiece.  The arguement made in this film is that no matter how hard we try we can never achieve a uptopian society.  Sure society today has some flaws but it is sophisticated and fair for the most part.  Message of the movie to me was no matter how hard you try you can't be perfect.

B00006V9A0|5.0|I would give this CD a 3 but I gave a 5 only because...<br />1) Someone who does not have any Nirvana CDs could get this as a good introduction to Nirvana.<br />2) Nirvana.<br />3) Nirvana and nice quality recording of You Know You're Right on it (although this song may not be best for those who never listened to Nirvana before).<br />DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM IF<br />- You are a big Nirvana fan, and have all the released and bootleg albums (or MP3s)<br />- If you are becoming a big fan of Nirvana and have some of the albums... don't waste your money on this CD... make sure you first have all the other albums... then try to get bootlegs or songs off of Kazaa or something...<br />- If you are thinking of getting it as a gift to someone who IS a big Nirvana fan...

B000069HKH|4.0|Springsteen's best characters have always been average people - the Vietnam Vet, the factory worker, the immigrant, the restless. People who, as Springsteen wrote twenty years ago, at the end of every hard-earned day still find some reason to believe. The victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 - those who died, those who managed to survive, and those throughout the country unnerved by fear - are no different. In the uncertainty in the wake of 9/11, we're all just trying to find a reason to believe.<br />Fans have waited for an album like this for some time. Springsteen has only released three albums since TUNNEL OF LOVE in 1987 - the spotty HUMAN TOUCH and LUCKY TOWN in 1992, and the quiet, acoustic THE GHOST OF TOM JOAD in 1995. In the years since, he has rehashed greatest hits and outtakes and basically lived on the fumes of years past. For a songwriter of Springsteen's caliber, that's a shame. With the E Street Band behind him again and super producer Brendan O'Brien at the helm, THE RISING is a true return to form. The album \\"sounds\\" terrific, in fact, as O'Brien has come pretty close to capturing the band's legendary live sound. Songs like \\"Lonesome Day,\\" \\"The Rising,\\" \\"Worlds Apart,\\" and \\"Further On Up The Road\\" just throb and pulsate with energy and are going to sound great live. \\"Paradise\\" is a quiet, gorgeous little song that really sneaks up on you. And, overall, the album fits quite nicely in the Springsteen canon and even manages to break a little ground here and there.<br />The album is far from perfect, though. The strange thing about Springsteen is that, for a tremendously talented songwriter, he can still occasionally produce some real stinkers. Anyone remember \\"Man's Job\\" or \\"Crush On You or \\"Gloria's Eyes\\"? Well, now we have the Mellencamp-esque sentimentality of \\"Let's Be Friends\\" and the goofy funk of \\"The Fuse.\\" And \\"Mary's Place\\" isn't too bad, but it sounds like an outtake from 25 years ago. Other songs like \\"My City of Ruins,\\"\\"Into The Fire\\" and \\"You're Missing\\" are still great here but sound better stripped down than they do on record. Anyone who saw Bruce perform \\"You're Missing\\" with just him at his piano on Saturday Night Live would agree.<br />As other reviews have noted, many of the songs on THE RISING have simple verse-chorus-verse structures, and short, catchy and repetitive choruses that are seemingly crafted for commercial radio. In this case, though, this works fine for Springsteen because he has the luxury of context. He says just enough to get us thinking and the context of September 11 fills in the rest. Some of the images in Springsteen's lyrics here are simply staggering and impossible to ignore. And if you don't react instinctively to \\"The Rising\\" or \\"Lonesome Day,\\" emotionally to \\"Into The Fire\\" or \\"You're Missing,\\" or spiritually to \\"My City of Ruins,\\" then, brother, you ain't living.
0875847706|1.0|I can only imagine spending time with this couple.  Perhaps, say, meeting them at a dinner party.  The conversation goes something like this:<BR>Rosamund:  &quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;<BR>Guest:  &quot;Well, I was born in Boston.&quot;<BR>Rosamund:  &quot;Now, put that in the context of ME.&quot;<BR>Guest:  &quot;Well, you live in the Boston area.&quot;<BR>Rosamund:  &quot;That's right.  I've got my act together.  In fact, I've got my act together more than anyone else in Boston.&quot;<BR>Benjamin:  &quot;Well, let's talk about me in Boston.  I conduct kids orchestras.&quot;<BR>Rosamund:  &quot;That's right, that allows us to pronounce general platitudes about life, management, love, and self esteem.&quot;<BR>Benjamin:  &quot;You know, I wasn't always this perfect.&quot;<BR>Rosamund:  &quot;Benjamim, shut up.  I asked our guest to put his comments in the context of ME.&quot;<br />This was one of the most useless and unbearable books I've ever read.  I kept reading, to the bitter end, just to see if it stayed as bad as it started.  It did.<br />What a waste of paper and ink.
B00006JSS8|4.0|There is definitely something here for everyone who is a Stevie Wonder fan, from the beginning of his career all the way up to his most recent hits.  There are old favorites, and perhaps even a song or two that some fans may not have heard more than a few times.  Of course, the drawbacks to doing a collection for an artist like Wonder is that producers must make difficult choices about what songs will or will not be included.  It would have been easy to dedicate a two CD set to Wonder's work, and still have left some things off that some fans would have missed.  I would love to have seen songs like &quot;All in Love is Fair,&quot; &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; and &quot;Don't You Worry Bout A Thing,&quot; included, and I'm sure that other fans could think of other songs they'd like to have seen on this collection.  But that slight criticism is softened by the reality that producers were dealing with a finite medium, and  some songs simply didn't make the cut.  Still, this is a great purchase for anyone who is a Wonder fan or who wants to introduce someone to Wonder's music.  It will definitley be a mainstay in my collection.  Of course, I may add a few more songs and create my own &quot;Definitive Collection&quot; of Stevie's work.
1559409010|4.0|A very different interpretation on the life of Jesus, we here follow the life of Brian who by pure accident becomes the messiah despite him being a very naughty boy (according to his mother). <BR>   The only thing I can compare this movie to would be Aristophanes' \\"The Clouds\\". While the movie does touch upon some seemingly almost valid criticism, it's primary purpose is to get laughs at any cost.<BR>Although I'm not a huge Monty Python fan, I must say that this movie is too funny to at not at least be watched once.
B00006JDVV|1.0|The comercials showed helicopters.  The posters and trailers and production stills showed helicopters.  I saw images of hundreds of dragons torching large buildings.  The previews and comercials led us all to believe that this move took place in the present day or near future where dragons appeared and laid waste to our civilization, massive battles between a modern army and an ancient race.  This is what I wanted to see.  <BR>     Instead I got a two or three minute filmreal of still photographs of magazine covers showing dragons burning stuff.  Pretty much all the same stuff they had put into a half dozen TV commercials.  The posters and DVD case show multiple helicopters in the air. In the movie there was only one helicopter and it didn't even have guns on it.  There was none of the destruction or fighting that the trailers promised.  Only the aftermath of dragons, burned out barns and scorched rocks and such.  Not to mention that there was never more than one dragon on the screen at a time unless they were so far away they could have been crows or other small birds.  This movie is a total let down.  I'm not going to buy the dvd and frankly I want my eight dollars back.  This movie could have been great.  All it needed was a little more carnage, some cool explosions and multiple helicopters like it showed on all its advertising.  <BR>     Save your money or buy something else.
B00005JKCF|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of action adventure movies - I can take or leave them, and I'm certainly no Marvel Comics buff, but Spidernman was superbly done, brilliantly cast and a movie I'd watch again and again!  Tobey McGuire was no less than perfect as Peter Parker/Spiderman and brought real substance to the character.  Kirsten Dunst sparkled as MJ and had endearing chemistry with Tobey McGuire.  I can't wait for the sequel, so long as McGuire and Dunst are not replaced!  For an acurate review, see \\"medmeeting\\" May 6, 2002.  I agree with that review.  The viewer from Springfield, USA, Oct 29, doesn't know what they're talking about, obviously isn't a comic buff either, and wouldn't know a good movie if they starred in it.
B00006NSZ5|4.0|What makes for a great soundtrack might turn off some Eminem fans. Eminem takes on most of the production duties and we all know he's a better writer than producer. But if your looking for some real dramatic cuts, then this is where to find them. Of course the radio boasted \\"Loose Yourself\\" is excellent but my personal favorite solo cut by Em on here is \\"8 Mile.\\" He hits the lyrics with an excellent stride. Young Zee and Rakim both turn out some HOT cuts and the Gangstarr joint is typical Premo and Guru. What's really crazy is the toned down Freeway on \\"8 Miles and Runnin'\\" with Jay-Z. Sounds like Jay had him take it down a notch, but they still make a good contrast of one another. Xzibit, D12, Obie and 50 Cent all hit you with typical tracks from their vault. And Em really losses himself on the end of D12's \\"Rap Game\\" when he spits in pig latin! Definitley an interesting mix of material. All though not an Eminem album, you can hear Em creeping around on every cut, through beats or lyrics.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that left me feeling sick after watching it.  Quite a tribute to the movie makers, eh?  Really, the only other movie I felt like that after watching was Seven.  <br />This movie will put you deep into the minds of some mentally unstable people.  People who were very normal once, people who either have weak minds or who have been wounded somehow, people you may even know yourself.....and it may even force you to take a really good look at yourself after this movie is over.  Which is perhaps the scariest thing of all....<br />The two people this film focuses on are a mental patient from the hospital many years ago, and one of the workers there now trying to clean the place up.  The mental patient's story is told through some taped sessions, found by a worker by chance and listened to by him on his free time to find out what sort of things went on in the hospital.  The worker's story was told in bits and pieces as well, and the viewer really won't know who the insane person is or why he does what he does until the very end.  The 2 stories show how different people in totally different circumstances can end up reaching for help in the same way...and have the same kind of destructive results.  Very creepy stuff.<br />I must say that this movie seemed fairly boring through most of it the first time I watched it.  But the last 20 minutes were heart-stopping!  Hang in there, and watch it again some time.  I just watched it for the second time, and it was TWICE as creepy, TWICE as heart-pounding, and TWICE as sickening.  If you like deep-down psychological scares, this is a must-see.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|In the 70's, English bands were the champions of heavy metal. Led Zeppelin was the biggest band in the world. America had a couple bands that rose to the top of the metal heap and fought for domination of hard rock: Aerosmith and KISS. Then, in 1978, Van Halen came to kick [behind], and take names. Their debut was the best since Led Zeppelin's. Eddie introduced finger tapping to metal. David Lee Roth out did every other frontman for showmanship. Aerosmtih was too messed up on drugs to compete. KISS was huge but would fall apart within a couple years. Van Halen opened for Black Sabbath and blew them off the stage. Deep Purple was broken up, so Van Halen captured the metal crown. The only bands to give them competition were AC/DC and Judas Priest. It was a great time for hard rock. This album is a must for heavy metal fans. If you like this kind of music, you MUST own a copy of this.

0380713802|4.0|In his book \\"Neither here nor there\\" Bill Bryson writes about the experiences he made when he was travelling through nearly the whole of Europe, fluent in only one language (which is English). <BR>He starts in Hammerfest, Norway (as far north as you can get in the world by public means of  transport, he says), goes to Paris, Brussels, Belgium, Aachen and Cologne in Germany, then on to Amsterdam, Hamburg in Germany again, Copenhagen in Denmark, then onto Sweden (Gothenburg and Stockholm), then down to Rome, then to southern Italy (Naples, Capri and Sorrento), up to the top (Milan, Como), through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Yugoslavia, Sofia in Bulgaria, and finally Istanbul.<BR>As you can see, by reading this book you'll learn a lot about European countries with their different languages, customs, habits and ways of life. But this isn't one of those boring highbrow books, that you can't read without falling asleep - no! - once you start reading you can't stop. Bryson has a unique brand of humour that I personally like very much. He is able to crack jokes about any situation, no matter how hopelessly and unpleasing they might have been.<BR>Especially as an European citizen you'll have a lot of fun because you recognize all the stereotypes that you know either from telling or personal experience. And be prepared for some nasty jokes about your compatriots!<BR>All in all I can highly recommend this book to everyone who wants to get to know European countries in an amusing and interesting way.
1590710037|5.0|When it comes to books,  I'm an owner of thousands, a reader of some and a fan of few. This book cannot be put down, no matter how hard I tried not only did I read it but it was so good , I turned off the television and tuned for the first time in a really long time into my soul. I only stopped momentarily to grab a pen and write a poem, which was the first time I have written in five years. You see I was paralyzed wanting to say so much but afraid nothing was going to come out. I am speaking to you because this book is an umbilical cord that connects you with yourself, it is not the typical ego book where their is seperation between reader and writer,He is real, the book is beautiful, and pleasant to look at.  By the way I always thought the people who wrote these reviews were related or the author's publisher and I admit that even though before I read this book I was not related or for that matter heard of Steven Pressfield, but after reading and experiencing this book and having many an epiphany, I feel he is a spiritual sibling and thank him for writing this work of art on the art of work, \\"The War of Art\\"!!
0316666343|4.0|The strong feeling of pathos between the young Susie and all that could have been in her young life and how her family individually reacted to her death is staggering.  I became totally immersed in Susie and her tragedy.  Never did the author deviate from her point-of-view of an adolescent.  As her family grew up around her, Susie became frozen in time.  Until, through her sister's life, she lived out her one final fantasy.  <br />The author did an excellent job of defining the various forms of grief between her family members.  She also did an excellent job of defining that mysterious place where dead people go.  I am not sure that a resolution different than the author's would have made a difference.  The story was about people, not events.
B00006CXXU|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!! I never expected. At first I was a little weary about buying it, but now I'm so glad that I did. I bought it 2 days ago and it's barely left my cd player since. I would recommand this cd to anyone. The songs are so great and the lyrics are so raw and you see the real person, not someone who is pretending to be someone else. If you are looking for a gift for someone this Christmas, your looking stops here.
B000002H6C|5.0|As great as Metallica is, this album proved that Metallica is greatER. This is truly a masterpiece. It is everything music should be.
B000065U1N|5.0|Yeah, it's a bold statement, but Black Hawk Down gave me everything I really wanted out of a war movie.  Despite your average movie-goers preference, real-life war doesn't give you the privilege of character development as well as conventional solutions to real-life problems.  What Black Hawk Down did as a movie was the same thing as Black Hawk Down did as a book: give an account of a particular day in America's involvement in Somalia where a simple mission goes, shall I say it, terribly wrong.<br />Here's where the flick rocks: there's a brief intro to the characters and mission before they head on out to Mogadishu.  Once the action starts, it pretty much goes as it did years ago. When you realize how much funk the troops went through in such a short amount of time, you start to feel the same \\"Ohhhhh crap\\" feeling that they must have felt then.  A bond is formed with the characters and THAT'S where it counts.  You may not know all too much about them nor their mission, but in their situation, they probably weren't that much keener than you.  They just wanna make it out alive, and so do you.  Not a lot of war flicks do that bonding enough, and if they do, some odd miracle pops up that makes you go \\"wait, how did that happen?\\"<br />As you might have gotten from the negative reviews, this isn't a story-driven movie.  It's an account of real war that happens in the real world.  It's your choice from there to decide if you want that, but I'll assure you that if you dig the latter, you'll definitely dig the flick.
0553260111|2.0|I think Jason Bourne's name changes two or three times in the book before you get to the end.  The action is good, but it's too unrealistic.  Unless you're into books that include the die hard James Bond character who manages to survive every impossible scenario, but has time for a love affair all the while trying to learn his identity and escaping the bad guys, then this book is for you.  I hope the movie is better.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|man, this guy keeps gettin better and better! i love hardcore hip hop, but this guy is without a doubt the most hardest,original and honest artist.  you can see the maturity of his skills on each cd that he puts out. <BR>enjoyed the entire cd
0553260111|4.0|...that was pretty good for an action film to begin with. The story of an amnesiac who is driven to think he's a dangerous killer is full of suspense and lots of neat twists that almost never feel contrived. Even though the book is over 20 years old, it rarely feels dated (granted, from time to time you wonder why the hero doesn't just use a cell phone).<br />A few minor gripes: somtimes, the klanguage the characcters speak seems to be straight out of a romance novel. This gets better during the novel. I liked the character of Marie in the movie, where she was very convincingly portrayed by Franka Potente, because she was quite unusual for an action movie sidekick. She's even more interesting in the book, even though I could have done without her stilted language. Her complete change from victim to accomplice which looks very strange without reading it almost makes sense.<br />I didn't like the italics which convey the character's thoughts and are far too repetetive. I didn't care too much for the ending, too. I'm told all will be settled in the third installment, which I will tackle after finishing the second. <br />Any book that makes you buy two sequels at once can't be all bad.
B00005JKCH|4.0|I won't say too much about the movie, other than to say that it is my favorite of all the Superhero movies that have been made.  The DVD set is terrific with ton's of great extras.  However, the menus are difficult to navigate on a computer.  I can't seem to click directly on a menu item.  Instead, you have to move the cursor around for a while until I find just the right spot where the little hand appears.  In fact, there are some options that I have just not been able to select from my computer.  These problems don't crop up when watching on a TV.
0345339711|5.0|The two towers was a fantasy book. It was my favorite book I have ever read. In the book they explained the lands they lived in and the characters very well. There will also be a movie coming out about it soon. I hope if you read it you like it as much as I did.                               The thing I liked most about the book was the character. The character I liked the most in the book was Gollem he does not appear until later in the book. There are other characters in the book though. Boromir was my second favorite but he dies right away. The other characters are Frodo, Sam, Arogon, Legalos, Gimli, Pippin, and Merry.                                                                    The book explains every thing very well. I liked the book a lot and the next book I read will be the return of the king.        Well if you want to read a long book that has a good story then this is the book for you. I would only recommend this book to people hew like to read a lot though.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Great film overall.<br />Yes, the extra footage is on the disk, but you have to walk through a series of tests based on the movie to get to it. It took us forever (and I didn't think the footage was all that special). But just to set the record straight, it is there. I think we ended up walking through all the chapters on the extras disk to find the footage.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the most incredible series I have ever seen!  When I describe it to someone, I tell them that it is as intense as the first scene in Saving Private Ryan, but through the entire 10 episodes.  The book comes highly recommended too, and it was interesting to read through the book as you watched the episodes.  This is the most accurate portrayal of war time heros.
0060254920|5.0|Where The Wild Things Are by Maurice Sendak is a really great book.  It is winner of the Caldecott Medal for the Most Distinguished Picture book of the Year.  The story is about a boy named Max who puts on a wolf suit and makes lots of mischeif.  He is then sent to his room without any supper.  He then dreams of going to where the wild things are.  Something happens there and he decides that he wants to go home to where someone loves him the best and to the things that smell good to eat.  He goes back home and supper is waiting for him in his room.<BR>   This is a great book for teaching children how to put words and pictures together. Mauice Sendak did an excellent job with the pictures.  This book is not only fun to read and play along with but to learn a message.  That being in charge and having everyone listen to you isn't always the greatest.  Also, I think that this is an excellent bedtime story.  Your children will have fun listening to you read it to them, and then them reading it to you as they get older.  I highly recamend that you read this book.
B000002MFN|5.0|All I can say is this album is a must for any music fan!!  I would advise anyone who's interested in Madonna to buy it as soon as possible!!
0399226907|5.0|Oh my goodness!  I love this book sooo much!  It's one of my most favorite books of all time!  I've loved and read this book since as long as I can remember.  Eric Carle is one of my and I'm sure a lot of other people's all time favorite authors.  His books are all so bright and fun.  I like how this book has fictional and factual information.  For instance, it tells how the caterpillar starts out in an egg, then eats, geting fat, then spins itself a cacoon, turning into a butterfly.  The fictional part is that it says how it eats through all of this junkfood such as:  cake, pie, ice cream, a lollipop, ect.  That part right there is what makes it so fun.  It's not every day that you hear about a caterpillar eating all of those kinds of things.  I think that the pages are set up so cool.  There's holes punched through all of the things that he eats so that it really gives you the feelig that he really ate through it.  This book makes children excited about reading because it's so much fun.  I think that this is one of the best books out there that you can find.  Find out for yourself how great it is by reading it with your children.
B00006C79E|5.0|I want to target this review to people who're unfamiliar with SE, because  no review, good or bad,  could keep the true fans away.   The reason that you should buy this CD IMMEDIATELY is because it is pure joy.  \\"How We Live Now\\" is the most optimistic piece of pop music I have ever heard,  while \\"Action\\" is a shiny sparkly hit of a dance number.  Saint Etienne is pop music with class and intelligence.  They are pop music that conjures forth emotions of a warm childhood, a melancholy lover, and a bright happy future.  Buy it, and fall in love with pop music again!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is one of the best reconrds I have ever heard in my life.  It is completely and totally different from anything that you ever expected her to do, it's full of emotion and sensuality.  I never particularly cared for her music, but this is just mind blowing. Listen to it!
068485743X|5.0|After years of writing quarterly reports for the Board of Directors I can look at an eight page report of numbers and tell instantly there's a typo on page six.  It make perfect sense that editors can do the same with a manuscript.  It is more than helpful to look at my writing with my editor's eye plugged in.<BR>Madelyn West
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Whether you like this movie depends mostly on whether you buy into Baz Luhrmann's unique vision, because there's nothing to fault in the brilliant production values.  This movie is crafted perfectly: every frame is where it belongs and is photographed gorgeously, every note and sound is flawlessly performed and perfectly timed.<br />If, like me, you believe that the film was a splendid idea--the marriage of modern music to a period setting, designed to give us something much easier to relate to than a stuffy, parlor piece--this will be one of your favorite films from 2001.  I'm not a particular fan of musicals, but I was mesmerized by MOULIN ROUGE! I saw it on HBO and knew before half an hour had elapsed that I had to have the film in my collection. I've watched it close to 10 times in the last month.<br />I can't praise the performers enough: Ewan McGregor's smile is positively dazzling, Nicole Kidman (not one of my favorite actors) shines like &quot;the sparkling diamond,&quot; John Leguizamo lends a poignance to Toulouse, Jim Broadbent's Zidler is a man I want to party with, and Richard Roxburgh's Duke has just the sort of sniveling bite that will make you love to hate him.<br />So why do so many people think this film is stupid?<br />The music.<br />Like Brian Helgeland's A KNIGHT'S TALE, MOULIN ROUGE! attempts to marry the modern with the classic, mixing original songs with modern hits like Elton John's &quot;Your Song,&quot; The Police's &quot;Roxanne,&quot; Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; Madonna's &quot;Like a Virgin,&quot; and a medley of pretty much every overplayed love song from the last 20 years.<br />My sister told me it was the medley that lost her--it didn't work for her, so she was knocked out of Luhrmann's tableau.<br />So that seems to be what it comes down to: do you like to see a film take chances? Are you willing to give the director enough rope to hang himself on the off chance that he'll use the rope to pull his audience up toa higher level?<br />I love this movie, and I love the DVD even more: special features that are spectacular, brilliantly integrated into the film itself so you can see Luhrmann's thought processes at work. If, as with THE MATRIX, every DVD producer made the extras this entertaining, people would actually watch something other than the deleted scenes.<br />Part of the genius of MOULIN ROUGE!, as exposed by the special features, is that it feels like Luhrmann's not finished with it, yet--that if he had the time and the money, he'd go back and change it yet again, showing us different facets of the sparkling diamond, darker corners of the underworld, and maybe more of McGregor's teeth.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Does anyone here own the first 2 (technically three, counting the christmas album) Christina Aguilera albums? You may as well throw them away after listening to the artists third and most recent effort \\"Stripped\\". \\"Stripped\\" is brave, its bold, and for a supposed \\"teen-queen\\", very adult. EVERY song on this album is worth listening to, and there's a song for almost every musical taste. \\"Dirrty\\" is actually one of the weaker tracks on the album, but sounds manufactured specifically for being a first single. Because I like to be amazingly thorough (maybe boringly), I'll go cut by cut. \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\" features the rapping talents of \\"Queen-B\\" Lil' Kim. While at first it appears to follow the same lines as \\"Dirrty\\" the message is not only well-said, but well-thought out and interesting. Its a song with a beat, and a message. \\"Walk Away\\" is a song where Christina is truly allowed to show off her vocal talents. Her throaty, husky voice makes the track sexy and soulful, not to mention incredibly catchy. It sounds like a song that Aretha might have wanted to take a look at, and she couldn't have done any better. \\"Fighter\\" is one of my faves on the album. It speaks to you in a gruff fashion about self confidence and preaches the saying \\"What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger\\". Anyone who at one point wasn't anyone, will love this song. \\"Infatuation\\" lets Aguilera exhibit a latin flavor and beat. This song is both sexy and interesting, talking about a girl trying not to fall in love with a latin man, the same kind of man that lead to her own mother's infatuation and eventaully to her birth. \\"Impossible sounds\\" like a Marvin Gay standard, as well as pure Alecia Keys. You could completely imagine Alicia singing this song, but when you listen to it...you wouldn't want her to. Christina does great ad-libbing and her voice is fantastic as she really belts it out. \\"Underappreciated\\" is probably the weakest track on the album, lacking some imagination and sounds very \\"Destiny's Child\\". It still, however, manages to be catchhy which still makes it worth listening to. \\"Beautiful\\" is probably the best and most beautiful track on the entire record. With the help of Linda Perry, Christina delivers the song with a husky scratch and enveloping emotion that sucks you in and won't let you go. The song is so good on its own that it would sound great coming from anyone, but it made that much better by Christina's vocals. \\"Make Over\\" allows Aguilera to go to the rock side of the pond, nearly screaming the chorus into your ears, but still managing to make it sound pretty. The song is full of girl-power and strength, which makes it that much more appealing. Cruz is another Perry-influenced track that talks about leaving home for the first  time and \\"leaving to change\\". You can almost see the scenery flying by as her voice completely resounds the words she sings, first peaceful and then strong. \\"Soar\\" is a song about inner strength and independence saying \\"Don't be scared to fly alone\\", it manages to be minorly preachy without being embarassing. \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is about having a \\"casual\\" relationship mainly based in sex. While most songs like this can be vulgar and crude, this song manages to stay sexy and real to the topic. \\"Dirrty\\", of course\\" is the song everyone knows. Its beat, its words all fit together so well that it makes the song attractive. Again, once you listen to this album this song seems almost out of place. \\"The  Voice Within\\" is another preachy song about being your own person and not being afraid to be independent, but is so pretty that what normally would be a \\"boring\\" or \\"embarassing\\" song of the mundane (i.e. \\"Not a girl, Not yet a woman\\") Christina again manages to make it interesting with her flowing vocals. \\"I'm Okay\\" is the most personal, brave and vulnerable song on this album. It begins with the real tears of the singer, and actually sounds scary and heart-felt as she sings about the abuse she and her mother endured from her father when she was just a child. \\"Bruises fade father, but the pain remains the same\\" she belts, and you can just hear the pain in her voice. The final track \\"Keep On Singing My song\\" is very pretty with a choir doing her back-up. It makes everything  more upbeat after listening to \\"I'm Okay\\", and finishes the album on a good and inspiring note. <BR>  The strength, the talent and the personality of Christin Aguilera was poured into this album, which is far superior to all of the ones she has recorded in the past. Even if you are not a fan, there is something on this album for you. If this is the new and real Christina, I hope she's here to stay.
B00005JLDW|4.0|I went into Reign of Fire not knowing what to expect from the movie. I had read several reviews, both mixed, so I really wasn't sure what kind of movie this was going to be. To be perfectly honest, up until about two months before the movie was released last Friday, I had not idea it even existed, which isn't necessarily a case of bad marketing, just maybe some bad exposure to the consumer. Besides all of the trivial, \\"What was it going to be like?\\" questions, I wondered if it could come out from behind Men in Black II's shadow and hopefully stomp on Tom Hanks' Road to Perdition. <br />Reign of Fire was an excellent movie, and one wonders why it didn't beat out the two movies listed above in the box office, but as my friend Thomas Porter said to me during our screening of the movie on Sunday, \\"This is sure to be a cult classic.\\"<br />So does Reign of Fire have the ability to join the ranks of Pulp Fiction and Army of Darkness as one of the great cult fiction movies of our generation? Yes, in many ways.<br />The movie focuses on the awakening of a pre-historic dragon species that every couple of thousand years comes out of their slumber to reek havoc upon the world. They caused the extinction of the Dinosaurs, they caused the Ice Ages with the ash that plagued the sky and cooled the planet, they help evolution along in some ways. But when a young boy named Quinn awakens the dominant male of the species it only takes a matter of years before the cities of the Earth are in ruins, and the human species could be the next on the Endangered Species Act.<br />Still many would hear the plot, and think this is your typical post-apocalyptic movie with humans struggling to survive after a nuclear explosion/deadly plague/or undiscovered species (pick one). This isn't no Waterworld, and Matthew McConaughey is one bad-ass in this movie as Van Zan the leader of an American troop of soldiers who have killed hundreds of these flying beasts. When they learn that it all started in London, they set out on a mission to destroy the dominant male and the species.<br />While most plot points are predictable, and several overly used theatrical elements are present (like killing a main character), the movie excels past them, and is amazing in the visual department of a very grey, dark world where fire has consumed the planet. Luckily, the use of the dragon special effects were never overused, there are only a few instances where you actually get a good look at one, and boy do they look pretty.<br />Reign of Fire is a popcorn movie, but after seeing Men in Black II last week and having some time to reflect upon it, I would have much rather have seen Reign because of the fact this movie has nothing to prove, it is just good story telling and good direction. Excellent movie, excellent cast, makes for an excellent time. Don't' miss this one.<BR>  <BR>-Erich Becker never wants to be an Arch Angel.
0676973779|5.0|Yann Martel's novel takes us from a small community in India to the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where a boy and a tiger share a lifeboat and develop, if not a friendship, a unique understanding of one another. The novel begins slowly and I wasn't sure if I was going to like it, but I also couldn't put it down, especially once on the high seas. Like any seafaring tale, it may be &quot;tall&quot; in parts, and you can, if you wish, choose to believe an alternate story provided for you near the end, but I prefer the taller of the two tales, and was bleary-eyed but well rewarded for reading it in one long sitting.
0060926317|3.0|Thank you Marlo for sharing your experience.<BR>I appreciate the possibilities you showed me.<br />After 2 years, I figured out who the God of this book is.<br />This God believes the spiritual state is better than the physical state. This God has a spiritual body but not a physical body. This God wants the aborigines to return to their supposedly superior spiritual life and stay there.  (He doesn't mention resurrection.)<br />This God says people may stop reproducing. The only true God has not modified his command to multiply and replenish the earth. <br />The God of this book says the earth is dying.  I guess he can't do anything about that.  <br />Even though Marlo learned a lot, the \\"real\\" people violated her free agency when they kidnapped her and made her go on this trek.<br />For me, the real message of these \\"real\\" people is to develop more faith in my God, Jesus Christ.  The possibilities are endless.
0380977788|4.0|We fellow the adventures of Coraline, a young girl wise beyond her years in the Other House. Gaiman builds an entire world (albeit a small one) that is deliciously creepy and strange. The attention he pays to small details - an eerie theme song guaranteed to give you the shivers, the 'doughy' texture of the Other Father's face, the malicious expression in the Other Picture - are touches that make 'Coraline' a gem and a wicked scare.<BR>However, if I could give 3.5 stars, I would. 'Coraline' is really an excellent one-off read but not worth the price (I own the paperback novel) I felt that without the suspense, much effect is lost upon re-reading the book. It's still an enjoyable read the second time around, but falls short when compared to Gaiman's other works. Coraline as a character lacks emotional depth. While I rooted for her, she's easily forgettable. More interesting characters are the cat and the Other Mother, but they are under-developed (forgivable within the constraints of length of a Children's book)<BR>For children, 'Coraline' is highly recommened. For older readers, I do recommend the book as a light read, but Gaiman has written better.
B00004XONN|5.0|At the time I was given this album as a gift, I had only heard one or two other songs by Radiohead (the indispensible &quot;Creep&quot; from PABLO HONEY which still gets a lot of airplay in my area, and, inadvertantly, &quot;Exit Music (For A Film)&quot; when I saw ROMEO + JULIET by Baz Luhrmann).  From the first synthesized notes of &quot;Everything In It's Right Place&quot; to the last harp chords in &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;, this album mesmorized me.  I immediately became addicted.<br />The charm of KID A (for me, anyway) lies within the playfulness between the synthesized sounds, the acoustic instruments, and lead singer Thom Yorke's distinctive and divergent vocals.  Steeped in moodiness and contempt for pop culture and complacency while mixing and matching minimalism and mockery of overuse, Radiohead has concocted a very distinctive and amazing album.  This album is the pinnacle of Radiohead's evolutionary style of producing music.<br />For the person who has not experienced the full range of Radiohead music out there, KID A is a good introduction to the experimental world in which this band produces music.  From here, you can go back to the previous albums and listen and enjoy what came before.  You can discover what they've tried before, what was incorporated in their latest music, what was left out, and what is entirely new.<br />Enjoy.
B000056VPD|2.0|Yeah, this was something completely different from my expectations!! I am a huge admirer of his opus, but this item put some questions in front of me: 1-Why this concert was picked, among hundreds of others to be eternaly saved on DVD, if its purpose is to present GB at his best? What about the eighties when he was in the orbit, with superb performances and fantastic musicians? 2-Where is the spirit of the Live-feeling here, the audience is around age of 50, preferably standing than dancing, which also reflects the choice of songs, not so many in the groove, the icon of GB. The band looks floppy on the scene, it is almost jammed with big orchestra, and such an ensemble only disperses the energy, especially the rhythm. Why Ireland, where GB is not at domestic mood, instead of USA, Waterfront Hall is more suitable for classic concerts than jazz-pop-soul performances? 3-The band should have two or three female back-vocals, was it such a hurry or conception that,I don't know, all I know is that males didn't do the job properly, listen Give me the night. The girls would give better image and voice on the scene, the producers could have engaged them for Such concert. 4-I can only summarize that there is no more edge in the music of GB in this concert, his zenith passed, which is understendable, but I think that this presentation will disappoint many who like Mr. Benson.
B00006G8G1|4.0|The only thing I don't like about this DVD is the choppy editing. You'll think it's great if you've got ADD, but it cuts so much, it's maddening.

1573222038|1.0|This is the first and last book I will ever read based off of its inclusion in the Booker Prize short list. Why this was ever critically aclaimed is beyond me. The storyline is preposterous (although, I admit, I was slightly engaged in the first of the three parts, but that was before the emergence of ridiculous plot twists), and the writing lacks the wisdom, insight, and, at the very least, technique to pull this novel about Victorian porno fiction into a realm that could remotely be called literary.  If you want a good laugh, read this book.  It has offered me many moments of amusement, but overall, it is trite.
B00003CX8J|5.0|when i first saw this movie, i thought i would hate it. i never liked x-men before, and i am skeptical about superhero movies. from the first scene, however, was hooked. it has plenty of action, and it is a classic villian movie. like gandalf and saruman of LOTR, the leaders on both sides are good friends. I dont want to give away to much of the movie, so go see it for yourself!
B000003S2K|4.0|i read this Q \\"cash for questions\\" where they asked eno if music for airports had ever actually been played at an airport. he said once he visited brazil, and to honor him, they played it as he arrived at the airport. BUT, they played it at ear-splitting volume, which hilariously negated the calming effect it was supposed to have. haha i love imagining that tableau. anyway if you play this at a normal volume, you'll enjoy it. good music for washing up. incidentally, one of eno's oblique strategies? \\"do the washing up.\\"
1558908382|5.0|There are few movies I can watch again and again without getting sick of it, and this is one of them.  The dialogue is sharp, the delivery perfect and the casting perfect.  The idea that throughout the whole movie, Martin tells people straight up what he does for a living (kill people) and they don't react in any way until they see him actually kill someone is a hoot.  Combined with all of the witty  subplots, this movie really engages me.  <br />In addition to the fun script and acting, the soundtrack is perfectly matched to the mood of the movie.  I can no longer hear any of the songs played in the movie without thinking of GPB, a sign of a well done sound track.  If you buy one John Cusack movie, I'd be stumped between recommending this movie or better off dead, but I'd go with this one simply as its a tighter movie overall.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Already one of my all-time favorites and I feel like I'm hearing it for the first time. Some of it I AM hearing for the first time. NOT a re-packaging rip-off. A pretty good deal. Of course, if you don't already have S+E I envy you the opportunity to hear this thing afresh and anew. A no-doubt-about-it hit.
B00005JLRR|5.0|Amazingly enough, this film was actually showing at my small-town theater on opening weekend!  Because of my schedule, I wasn't able to see it until Sunday -- by which time the local newspaper reviewers had already given it a thumbs-down.  I decided to go see for myself -- and I'm glad I did.  The film has excellent special effects, and a storyline that gives much to think about concerning the issue of cloning.  I had heard in advance that Data was going to die in this film -- and he does, but not before putting his programming into an earlier prototype called B-4.  There's a strong resemblance to \\"STII: The Wrath of Khan\\" here, where Spock put his katra (soul-memory) into McCoy's mind before sacrificing himself to save the ship.  At the end of the movie, B-4 shows signs of accessing Data's memory, the same as Spock recognized Jim Kirk at the end of STII.  I sure hope there's going to be a sequel!  And speaking of Spock, it would have been nice to see him make an appearance.  The last time we heard of him (in TNG \\"Unification\\") he was still working underground to bring Romulans and Vulcans together.  Maybe next movie?  Also, According to an interview with Patrick Steward in TV Guide, there were a lot of great scenes that got cut out of the theater version, which, hopefully, will show up on the DVD edition.
B00005ATQD|1.0|This review will be easy enough- Too Long. Big Build up leads to a big let down. If you like Foreign Films that move at the pace of molasses and often times seem to try and make a point or have a plot but really don't, then this american [I think its american] movie will be really, really familiar. Even the fact that I like naked women couldn't possibly save this movie. Maybe I am just the dumbest man alive but this movie was pointless. And the only thing worse than a Pointless movie is a long pointless movie that pretends to be full of point. This is that movie. How great to hear and see so much nothing in such a long period of time. What was the length of this movie? something like nine days I think. That is what it felt like anyway. The over dramatized- on the verge of seeing something- style of the movie is laughable. The biggest flop in the careers of any of the stars, and that is saying something too. I like Cruise and Kidman in some roles but this one was just a torture of a movie. Why would anyone want to BUY it? Could you sit through it enough times to make the price worth it even if you liked it? This is awful, and I don't say that about just anything! You can't eat popcorn to this one. I've seen a lot of good movies with substance that you can't eat popcorn to though- this isn't one of those either.
B00000JGEN|4.0|This is a pretty good movie for arnold.  Taking a different direction from his last few blow-em up shoot-em up type movies (terminator,commando,raw dea), this type, arnold is running for his life instead of the bad guys.  Their is plenty of good action, with some great hand to hand fights, and even the \\"fake\\" fight with jesse ventura is a pretty descent fight between them.  The villain/s are good, a hockey bladed foe, a chainsaw wielding bast  ard, a flame thrower, and an electic shockin man all provide a challenge for arnold to defeat.  But whats an Arnold movie without the occasional shootout.  IN the beginning prison  escape, arnold is caught up in the middle of a shoot out, and at the end he is also caught in a viscious gun fight.  A lot of diverse action.........it delivers
B000002UAR|5.0|One of rock's top ten albums ever.  REVOLVER deserves all the accolades it gets.  While the Beatles were in that wierd transitional stage between the sugar-coating and SGT. PEPPERS, they recorded this album and RUBBER SOUL.  REVOLVER contains some fascinating music.  You get the raw rock of Harrison's &quot;Taxman&quot; and the soft beauty of McCartney's &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere&quot; and the bizarre &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;.  In between, you get a bunch of other classic Beatles tunes, the most-well known of them being &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;.  The Beatles experimental side was beginning to shine brightly here.  They were breaking free of the 'mop-top' image, growning side-burns, long hair, smoking dope, and dabbling in eastern mysticism.  There would be no more live concerts save the rooftop in LET IT BE.  This album exemplifies the changes in the band even better than SGT. PEPPERS because that album strikes me as a more conscious attempt to be 'different'.  SGT. PEPPERS is a success because of the groundwork laid by RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER.<br />Essential.
B00005JKHN|4.0|I was in Lebanon for a week and was extremely surprised to find the Sleeping Beauty DVD in their Virgin Megastore, though the cover was in French, the employees there assured me it was in English too. <br />The box is beautiful all in purple feautring the classic kiss scene with the transparent head of Maleficent over them. it's a gorgeous matt box that's open from the right.<br />All the contents of the DVD is written on the back (in french sadly). Through the pocket you pull out the 2 DVD envelope case (like the EU Harry Potter DVD), the DVDs looks gorgeous and full of color. It also includes a shett of the scene numbers.<br />The first DVD before anything asked if I wanted to watch the whole DVD in english or french- which i found delightful since I've never seen this in any DVD- and everyhting from menu to little details was in english. <br />It contains the movie, making of feature, rescue Aurora game & a coloring book. The back of the DVD states there's also a special episode of Art Attack about making Sleeping Beauty's castle- sadly I didn't find this on the disk, so I don't know if this is a Hidden Feature. I tried to look for it but couldn't find it. One this is for sure, it's not on DVD 2. Interesting!<br />Disk 2 was a disappointment since the menus are in french so I didn't know what was going on, and sadly even some of the videos were dubbed French over the english track, which is very annoying and unprofessional. And the features that actually were in English had large french subtitles, and there's is no option for not viewing subtitles. I must admit that the french menus are a turn off, so sadly I lost all anticipation to watch the special features that i eagerly awaited.<br />One very important note, the DVD menus and Design is STUNNIG, the menus are made like old manuscripts and it's gorgeous. A very big shock is that this DVD is not released as a part of the \\"platinum collection\\" like Snow White & Beauty and the Beast, yet production wise, the cover, package, disk and menu designs surpass both Special Edition DVDs by a hundred mile.<br />the only reason I'm writing this review is because I couldn't find any information about this DVD anywhere (even on Disney.com) and I thought Fans of this movie would love to know what they're getting. If you need any scans of screen shots of this DVD please feel free to contact me.
0553579908|5.0|Why not just fantasy? Well, there is so much more to this fantastic ( slight pun intended) series. Firstly, although you do have fantasy elements ( dragons, the rather disturbing and hard to kill \\"Others\\"), you do not have any of the other tired cliches- there is no happy elves dancing in the forest, no missing sword/ring/stone that needs to be found, and no cute teenage characters who will soon gain power and blah blah overcome anchient evil and save the world. Put another way, this saga has none of the cliches that have so dogged modern fantasy. It is in short, gentle reader, turned the whole concept of fantasy upside down.<br />The novel is best described as a remarkable historical epic with fantastical overtones. Very few novels, and fewer yet fantasy novels have the sheer sweep and grandeur of this book. The plot is intricate yet dare I say it believable, the places well sketched, and the characters in turn lovable or loathsome. No other book has led to such heated discussion amongst readers as to which charcters they like or hate the most- and I am sure that you will find one that you identify with.<br />Martin is a very talented writer. Despite the vast sweep of the saga, the numerous and complex subplots, and incredibly writing the same action from the point of view of over a dozen central characters at no stage does the plot lag, or a unbelievable plot device inserted. He richly descibes scenes and characters, battles and places.<br />Any one who has trawled trying to regain the sense of delight from when you first read \\"the hobbit\\" or the Belgariad before it got tired would love this book. Even a general ready looking for a \\"fairy story\\" for adults would enjoy this.<br />As highly recommended as one can get.<br />Grade: A++

0060916540|4.0|So there you are, having climbed a wall of ice and rock and having celebrated on the top. On the way down an accident occcurs and your friend hurts himself. No problem, you can get him down on ropes. However, your friend starts to slip and pull you off the wall- and your hand reaches for the knife to cut the rope....<br />This, gentle reader, is what touching the void is about. Its an absolutly compelling true story of survival in the Andes, and about a &quot;routine&quot; expedition that went horribly wrong. The story itself is riviting, and the book has some incredible photos. (the one of Simpson after the events described is amazing).<br />The book itself is short and pithy, most readers will finish it in less than a week. This is more from the compelling nature of the story, not from any thing else. Simpsons style of writing is short and direct, and refreshingly honest.<br />Recommended.<br />Grade: A-
B000003TB6|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Roots album, and one of the few hip-hop albums I can listen to all the way through (Talib Kweli and DJ Hi-Tek qualify as well). The way it all flows together is so sweet, and Black Thought and Malik B's rapping bounces off the instruments so well. You've got hardcore rhyming, jazzy instrumentation, and mellow hip-hop all on one disc. All of the tracks are great in their own way, even the freestyles which I don't usually like so much, but the best are Distortion to Static, Mellow My Man, Proceed, You Ain't Fly....damn everything. Lazy afternoon is a really cool song too..
B00006V9A0|1.0|Nirvana fans should just burn the new song and wait for the box set. You already have everything else. If you are new to Nirvana, just spend a little more money and get Nevermind and In Utero. This album is missing a lot of good songs and does not do a good job of summing up Nirvana's entire career.
B00006AG5N|4.0|This album basically includes the same songs that are on other Elvis &quot;best of&quot; compilation albums.  Yes, some of them are slightly different versions or have otherwise been altered/enhanced for better sound quality (mainly vocals).  Some however, such as &quot;Wonder of You&quot;, sound worse.  If you're looking for a slightly different twist on the same old songs, then this album might do the trick.  Otherwise, the only other reason to get this album is for the bonus track, &quot;a little less conversation&quot;, which has been remixed by JXL to produce a sound as fresh as any of todays top hits.  Also, you can get that song, plus the extended play version and the original Elvis version on the short album &quot;JXL vs. Elvis&quot;.  All in all, the album is very good (4 stars), but contains nothing dramatically new.
B000001FS3|5.0|there are a bunch of great CDs around, but there is only one I think is just plain beautiful. a kind of beauty only U2 could do and it's called 'the Joshua Tree'.
B000063K2W|5.0|As a fan of classic movies, I had been introduced to this classic a few years back. Recently it was released on DVD and includes a few extras that are sure to please fans.<br />The Women is a story that focuses on the lives of women (there are no men in this film) that centers on the life of Mary and her struggle with divorce from her husband Steven.<br />Norman Sherer does a fine job with her role as Mary Hainey, but who shines is Rosalind Russell as her sharp witted friend. (Rosalind goes on to win a Golden Globe for her role in Auntie Mame--1954).<br />What makes The Women fascinating is the way they tackle such a taboo topic as divorce, infidelity, betrayal and revenge.<br />If you are a woman and have never seen this film, it is high time you stopped what you were doing, buy this film and enjoy.<br />There hasn't been a fine film with such an ensemble cast in such a long time. Think of this as the Steel Magnolias of 1936.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Is this the Christina I know?! Who cares her new album is great. She doesn't sing teeny pop music in this one! Her music is totally different. Which surprised me when I first listened to it! :)Even though it has cussing on this album it's still great! I just ignore the cussing. My favorite songs on this album are: Impossible, Dirrty, The Voice Within, and Fighter. I reccomend you buy this album today!!
0446310786|3.0|The story takes place in a small southern town.  Scout and her brother Jem are two young children being raised by their widower father Atticus and their housekeeper Calpurnia.  Tension is started to take place in the town for whites and blacks.  The black community in the town seem to like Scout's father and she doesn't understand why.  Her white friends are very racist and full of hostility.  Nasty things are said and heard by Scout.  She asks her father why.  Atticus is a lawyer, he is defending a young black man wrongfully accused of a grave crime.  All of this hatered stems from this case.  Atticus knows that it is the right thing to do.  The summer before Scout's first grade year her and Jem find a friend named Dill Harris.  He tries to get them into some trouble and they try to get the town's bogeyman, Boo Radly to come out.  Trouble is started in town with the adults as well.  Mayella Ewell is the daughter of a drunk and violet white farmer.  Tom Robison, a black man, is accused of raping Mayella Ewell.  Atticus is hired to defend him.  Both of the troubled scenes account for one death and a hell of a court case.  This whole time scout is trying to figure out the whole situation for herself.  This is a good book and very emotional and controversial.  The author Harper Lee does a terrific job making you want to read more.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops she did it again! But this time she did better! I love this album! Who cares what other people say about Britney, she's pretty, she's got great dance moves etc. Anyways, I reccomend you buy this C.D. today!<br />My favorite songs are: Stronger, Lucky, and When Your Eyes Say It.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I'm not going to bother telling you what's in the movie; you've probably already seen it.  So  I'll tell you about the DVD.<br />The commentary is not that good.  It keeps changing between the two males talking to each other and then to the two females talking to each other.<br />Highlighting the selections is troublesome, as the DVD relies on cute red dots to show you what option you are on, rather then clearly highlightling your current selection.<br />The feature showing Spidey's rogues' gallery was excellent, with brillant 3-D drawings of the villians.<br />Also of interest is a feature showing the 4 main love interests of Spidey's.<br />Best of all is the 30-minute documentary of Spidey in the 21st century.  Everyone should love it.<br />Definitely recommended.
B000031XCR|5.0|All The Way is a great C.D. of C&eacute;line, that she released before she retired for two years to have her baby boy Ren&eacute; Charles. I used to be a HUGE fan of C&eacute;line, but now I'm into other music... I still love C&eacute;line and always will but it's time I listen to other music now. I reccomend you buy this CD!
B000003CKH|5.0|This is CAKE's best album. It is also one of the first albums I ever bought. Cake travels all styles of music and weaves complicated rythms and beats while still incorporating that great catchy singalongability that all good albums should have. The songs on this one are beautifully poestic. Cake somehow the use of all the many different instruments and still make good rock music. This album is perfect for driving. It has driving rock ballads, sad love songs, even country inspired songs and a waltz at the end. Those musical genres may sound boring but cake makes them very fun and nothing but boring. I think this album will also appeal to ALL age groups. It does use the F word on a couple track but there is really no innapropriate themes or messages. Also, dont judge cake by what you hear on the radio. For some reason their radio songs always seem to be their most catchy but worst ones. This album as a whole is way more amazing when you have the whole thing infront of you.
B000001Y5D|5.0|I really liked this album. So I'd like to know if they've got another one. I think they do, but they stopped selling it, so if anybody has any information, please let me know.
B00005N6KG|3.0|From reading the other reviews it is easy to see that these have excellent sound quality. I don't need to say more about that. However,there's one problem. After wearing them for an extended period of time, your ears begin to hurt...not from the sound, but from the fit of the headphones themselves. And if you try to lay down on your side while listening with these, it hurts A LOT. you can probably get more comfortable headphones with the same sound quality.
0553296981|5.0|This is a beautiful book. A reminder of the dark times rather you are Jewish, or not. After you read her diary, you may feel the same ghostly feeling I have felt and still do. You are reading the diary that once belonged to a remarkable young girl. Words one wrote by a young girl sitting at a desk, looking out her window, wondering when the cruel war will be over. Wondering if she will make it. Writting down toadays conversations. You are reading her diary. The diary of a dead girl. A dead girl that died a lonly death in the concentration camp. Her face is a mask, hiding her troubles. Her eyes, what look so carefree in pictures, are seeing people being killed in streets. They are the same eyes that saw her family being gasses. They are the same eyes that took that last look of this cruel world before she drifted of into an endless sleep. She is now just a fading ghost. Her cheery face may be gone forever, but she has not been forgotten.<br />This is her story.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Possibly the best Superhero movie since the first two Supermans. What Spider-Man has going for it, are actors really enjoying their parts, a great script that doesn't insult the original conception and also that doesn't isolate casual viewers who may not know anything about the web-slinger, and a top notch director, Sam Raimi. And finally, can this be said? A movie about a Superhero with 'daylight\\" scenes. I'm a so sick of \\"superhero\\" movies in the dark. You get to see the action when all around is light. Toby Maguire is perfect as Peter Parker and our hero. Great execution, great timing and great special effects make this something more that just another Batman or X-Men, this is something special.
B0000633T6|5.0|This is by far the best thriller I've watched in a long time. It keeps you wondering till the end what turn the plot will take next and how the main character ( Robert Redford ) will deal with it. Both Redford and Pitt's character's are well developed, there are very good dialogue scenes and one really gets a feeling of involvement with an intelligence agency's inside politics. Ok so the ending is a bit sci-fi, but I rate this one 5-stars because I can't remember a movie that kept me wondering for the whole two hours and which I was eager to review once I had seen it first time in the movie theater. Don't miss it!
B000006045|5.0|Living up to the hype to the highest extent, Mezzanine is a ridiculously great album.  It's brilliance is quite hard to peg down with our mere mortal words and descriptions.  Mezzanine is a euphoric, dark, hard, scary, deep, fierce and massive album, in every sense.  I've owned it since 1999, and it is the only record that has stood the test of time, I have NEVER gotten sick of it in any way, it has this surreal staying power, regardless of how many times I hear it, the songs sound as fresh and as powerful and inspiring as it did on my first listen.  The highlights would be \\"Angel\\" \\"Risingson\\" and \\"Dissolved Girl\\" but every track is excellent and it stands as one of those rare perfect records where there never is a need to skip a song, oddly enough I find \\"Teardrop\\" is my least favorite, yet it's the most popular.  It's the perfect album to complement moods and settings, for me its my \\"listening to on my walkman while on a bus at 5am coming home from a psy trance party\\" CD.  Own it, listen to it, and immerse yourself in the absolute music bliss that is Mezzanine.
B000060P79|3.0|I'm not here to bash on Simple Plan, but I must say their songs aren't that unique. I saw Simple Plan in concert a few weeks ago with Good Charlotte and Autopilot Off (which was a GREAT show by the way) and they sounded awesome live. I hadn't heard them before so after the show I bought their CD for (Money). After listening to the CD the whole way through, I hadn't really been \\"moved\\" or \\"touched\\" by any of the songs. They're catchy, but to me, most of them sound the same. The group as a whole hasn't really developed their own sound. They sound \\"generic-ish.\\" (if that's even a word...) Hopefully in the future they can distinguish they're own \\"sound\\" but until then I think they need some maturing. Some good songs I recommend though are \\"God Must Hate Me\\", \\"I'm Just A Kid\\", \\"My Alien.\\" If you really want the CD go ahead and buy it, but for me I just want my (Money) back.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album almost defines the notion of brilliant rock music.<BR>I cannot think of another album that has immersed so many listeners into a very deep intellectual and philosophical headspace while combining the ideological aspects with some of the most incredibly moving rock music ever created.  The band creates contextual layers of sound that sound as thick as music can possibly get.  The album has the intense staying power to listeners because it is a blizzard of very developed and thought out songs, there is not an ounce of mediocrity or filler on Aenima.  Once the album is listened to, and it grows on you like a mold, it can be almost unfathomable that there are so many unbelievable tracks on one album.  Anyone of the current crop of rock bands atop the charts today would kill the have the amount of creative force and insane talent that Tool displays on anyone of the 9 or so songs on Aenima (excluding the...intermission-ish tracks).  In terms of lyrical depth, Aenima is knee deep in thought, comprehensive clinical ideas, that contrary to the pundits thoughts, are not pretentious or over the top.  Maynard expressed and brings forth ideas which have existed for time or are his own.  I wont divulge these ideas (check the Tool fansite, Innuendo Cornucopria for that) but his vocals will linger in your heart, spirit and intellect long after the music ends.  In a perfect world Aenima would have gotten the massive critical acclaim that it deserved, but if the music journalism community didn't appreciate the album, so be it...it's their loss and our gain.
B00005JKJA|4.0|It is typical David Lynch film.  Beautiful cinema photography<BR>and unique, interisting charcters, and plot sucks audience<BR>into movies.  At the ending, everyone get lost and we have <BR>to come up with own conclusions.  Naomi Watts was great discoverly in this film.  Mr Collins, you are not alone!<BR>DVD, I rented was messed up as well.  It is shame that <BR>going through defective DVD's totally spoil the movie <BR>until you find the right one.  It happned me when I bought <BR>Something about Marry and Me, Myself, and Irene.
B00006IU73|5.0|PT have created a powerful masterpiece. This CD is excellent and probably one of the year's best only with exception to the new Flower Kings CD &quot;Unfold The Future&quot; which is an even more ambitious  work. I listened to both of these back to back  the other night and was (as the one reviewer put it) wisked away to dreamland! I recommend both of these bands to all my friends. Don't miss out on this spectacular music!<br />(Also check out the new California Guitar Trio's CD - it is also an excellent effort).
B000059HAI|5.0|I began studying the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor at an early age, as a result of the special fascination the attack held for my grandfather, who's birthday was December 7th. Tora! Tora! Tora! tells the true history of the events leading up to the attack and of the attack itself.<BR> Looking back across the years and identifying all of the mistakes and intelligence failures on the part of the American Military establishment leaves one incredulous, first and foremost being a gross underestimation of the Japanese military, so much so that radio intercepts which gave clues to the attack were never forwarded to FDR or his staff because it was not believed that the Japanese were capable of the carrying out the attack. There was the Officer on Duty for the new radar station, who responded to news of \\"a large formation of planes approaching from the northeast\\" with the words \\"Yeah? Well, don't worry about it\\" because he mistakenly believed the planes were a flight of American B-17's.....the radio station which received a request to broadcast all night so the B-17's could home in on the signal- the Japanese found this to be quite helpful as well.....the officer who insisted on confirmation of the sinking of a Japanese submarine near the harbor entrance because of his fear that it was a false report, until it was too late.....General Short, commander of the US Army stationed at Pearl Harbor, who because of fear of sabotage had all aircraft parked together in the center of the airfields, making them easier to guard but a perfect target for air attack.....the intelligence estimate prepared by General Martin, which stated that \\"the Japanese would most likely attack on a Sunday. They would probably employ a maximum of six carriers...\\"- this estimate was regarded as giving the Japanese \\"too much credit\\" and not taken seriously. <BR> The Japanese attack, for all it's success, did not succeed in it's main objective- to destroy American carrier strength. This failure on the partof the Japanese proved to be a boon to the Americans, as it forced US Navy brass to center strategy around the use of carriers rather than battleships. The carrier-battleship debate had raged for years, with conservative Admirals refusing to admit that battleships were obsolete and that carriers were now their most important weapons.<BR> Anyone who has done serious research on Pearl Harbor will find ALL the major events depicted here. Nothing has been omitted, and nothing has been embellished. Tora! Tora! Tora! is almost a documentary of the attack.<BR> The cast members do a wonderful job, with Jason Robards as General Short, who would be covered in controversy and shame as a result of the disaster; Martin Balsam as Admiral Kimmel, who's family spent years trying to clear his name after the attack; James Whitmore as Admiral Halsey, who would lead the American carriers to victory over Japan; and Joseph Cotten as Secretary of War Stimson, who knew that the US was not ready for war and hoped to buy time by political means. For the Japanese sequences, Soh Yamamura as Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, whose brainchild the attack was (complete with missing finger, a wound suffered in the Russo-Japanese War); Tatsuya Mihashi as Commander Genda, brilliant planner of the attack; Takahiro Tamura as Lt. Commander Fuchida, who led the attack; and Eijiro Tono as Admiral Nagumo, the cautious Task Force Commander who broke off the attack even though he knew its main objective had not been met. American sequences were directed by Richard Fleischer and the Japanese by Toshio Masuda and Kinji Fukasuka. <BR> The cinematogrophy is spectacular, and the visual effects are fantastic, given that Tora! Tora! Tora! was released in 1970. The aerial sequences are well choreographed and shot, and the final scene of the film, Battleship Row smashed and aflame, is stunning.<BR> Tora! Tora! Tora! should be in the DVD library of anyone who is a fan of war movies or a student of military history.
B00006JDVV|1.0|this movie was hardly worth the {money} i payed for. yea we saw the previews and we all love dragons, but this is by far the worst dragon movie i have seen. it did not entertain me at all. through out the entire movie i was waiting for an \\"independance day\\" style explosion of a major us city. but the movie skipped all that. the ending was horrible. the acting was'nt the best. the plot could've been well adapted but the movie just did not cut expectations of an action, dragon movie.
B00005JK8K|1.0|I don't know why I waste my time watching John Woo movies. This guy is so over rated. I wanted to watch Windtalkers but turned it off after the second war action sequence. The war scenes were not realistic. In particular, the first battle involving Cage and the code breakers was too un-realistic. One view shows a bunch of foxholes (or bomb holes) all neatly dug out all looking identical. I could go on and on about Woo movies but I don't want to waste my time. I'm hoping to save others from wasting their time and money.
B00005JL2O|5.0|Austin Powers 3 (\\"Austin Powers in Goldmember\\") is no doubt the best Austin Powers out of the three. Moreover, it is one of the funniest movies ever made, you sit next the screen and never stop lough in about an hour and a half.<BR>The movie has all the caracters we already know, such as Austin, Dr. Evil, Mini Me, Fat basterd and the other. Next to them we meet Goldmember, another caracter played by the wonderful Mike Myers, and his fater, Michael Cane. When you put two and two together, you have an amazing performance and an amazing picture.<BR>If you've already seen it, I'm sure you'll be glad to see it again. If you haven't seen it, what the hell are you waiting for????
0812513495|5.0|With an intergalactic war looming the earths' only hope is a child prodigy who is too young to drive let alone man the helm of Earths global forces. As with most science fiction novels, at first this exposition seems to be far fetched at best. However, with the realization and acceptance of the facts that make sci-fi what it is. The reader is prepared to delve deeper into the latent messages that card has woven into the fabric that makes up Ender Wiggins. <BR>   Taken from his home as a young child, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggins is a 3rd child in a world where it is uncommon to be allowed to have 2 children and unheard of to be allowed to have 3. From the beginning we see that Ender is not like other children. He is even small for his age. He has been observed from his birth and scrutinized to determine whether or not he would be the savior of a world hardly worth saving. This pressure and the realization that he is ultimately alone in the world even left me, the reader, with scars. Card hits on 2 sublime points that I would like to comment upon:<BR>1st) Might makes Right<BR>2nd) Ender as a ticking time bomb<BR> The Earth has evolved into a society of nations that has unified in the pursuit of one common goal, the destruction of another race. The marauding Buggers are deamonized throughout the book. It is an interesting parallel to note that the game that Enders brother plays with him is not unlike cowboys and Indians with the Indians being slaughtered in the end. Card manages to bring out the worst in us. He has managed to point out the dark truths about our basic belief system as a people. \\"Might makes Right\\" -Adolph Hitler- <BR>   It was supposed that the Buggers had exhausted all of the resources on their planet and therefore were in search of a new planet to consume. An interesting irony is the fact that that is exactly what the human race does as they split their post apocalyptic booty among the nations. Cards comments on society may slip past many readers; however,with deeper inspection of the motives behind the plot we are able to better understand Ender's character.<BR> What made Peter the way that he was? What made him such a maniacal sadist? What made his sister Valentine so likeable and maternal? And what was it that made Ender a perfect combination of the two? The obvious answer would be, \\"Card did it to keep the story going you idiot.\\" But there has to be something more to it. Ender is the battle of the Id and the Superego personified. Ender finds himself in pitiful situations through out the book whether it be being picked on by a school bully or hopelessly outnumbered in an intergalactic \\"battle simulation.\\" His inclinations to kill, cripple and hurt others are only sullied by his desire to find acceptance and love; for crying out loud he just wants to find where he fits in the world. It is that point exactly that makes this book so appealing to young readers. They want to be good, they want to be free but most of all they want to be accepted. This internal angst that exists within Ender exists within us. The frightening thing is wondering who will win, the Id or the Super Ego. If the Id wins we will have several more 9-11's and Columbine's. For all our sakes I hope that our Superegos are victorious.
0380002930|4.0|This is an engaging and charming tale of Hazel, Fiver, Bigwig, Pipkin and the rest of their group in their quest for a safe home.<br />I will outline briefly the plot for you and then go into some of the aspects of the book that I found really creative and interesting. Fiver and Hazel are friends in a large and peaceful warren when Fiver, who is a kind of \\"seer,\\" senses great danger for all the rabbits who live there. The two rabbits meet with their chief rabbit, but he does not act on their warnings, so they leave with a group of rabbits, including Bigwig, a member of the Chief's guard, to find a safer home. They have many adventures on their way to Watership Down, where they decide to dig their new place. Then, they realize that a bunch of guys without women aren't going to have a warren for long, so hatch two plans to recruit female rabbits to their new warren. More adventures ensue, and a clever, funny, nail-biting, exciting and touching ending is reached.<br />It's such an engaging adventure story, and Adams tells it touchingly as an anthropological tale as well, including footnotes on lapine language (such as \\"Hrududu\\" for car, \\"elil\\" for enemies of rabbits, etc.) and culture and breaking up the line of the narrative with rabbit folklore of their trickster figure and their deities. The other warrens they encounter seem to be somewhat didactic plot devices in the book, but this aspect of the story does not overwhelm its charm and attraction.<br />It's a beautiful book and makes me look at rabbits in a new way! I recommend it and I think it would be good for young adults on through adulthood.
B0000524CY|5.0|Simply put, a masterpiece of cinema! It scares the crap outta ya and also makes lovable and memorable characters! It has an intelligent story and great plot and acting! Basing it on a true story makes it even more friegtening ... anyway go see this. Buy or Rent!

B00005JKCH|5.0|This was an incredible dvd! Lots of extra features, but I could of cared less about the extra features, because the movie basically payed for itself. It was that good! I like this just as much as I like Lord of the Rings, and Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones! Check this one out and be prepared for the ultimate spin!
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird, by Harper Lee is a novel I believe that every adult should read. The story is told through the eye of a little girl called Scout.She started the story by narrating the events that led to her brother's arm being broken.<br />The events in the story took place in the small Southern town of Maycomb, Alabama, during the Depression. To Kill a Mockingbrid decribes  a trial of black young man, Tom robinson who  was falsely accused of raping Mayella Ewell, the daughter of a drunk and violent white farmer. Atticus was called to  defended Tom Robinson and his children, Jem and Scout were caught up beyond their understanding because they were in the courtroom throughout the trial.<BR>  <BR>Maycomb, a recially biased towm convited an innocent man, Tom Robinson for a crime he did not commit. Although it is set in the 1930's in Alabama, events like this or even worse still takes place in our modern world but thank goodness there are still few Atticuses who are true patriot of ethics and morality.<BR> To Kill a Mocking is a life changing novel and I recommend  that everybody should read  it.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Okay. Let me put this simply...  <br />I had been a HUGE fan of Céline's from the very first time I heard her voice well over a decade ago. I grew in awe as she grew in fame... until she became so popular, and so sappy..that I just got bored. I still bought her music, as a fan would. After not listening to this album for well over a year(if not two), I JUST decided to pop it in my cd player.<br />WHAT WAS I THINKING !? How could I have ignored this album for so long. I am absolutely stunned at the majority of the songs here - despite having heard them before. <br />Some favourites ? S'il Suffisait D'aimer , Je Crois Toi, Papillon, L'abandon.<br />People ! I kid you not - if you don't have this album...you're in serious loss of a side of Céline not enough people know. I really wish that Sony would push her French music MUCH harder. She's much more frail, humble, feeling, warm in her native tongue... Not so in-your-face, and cheesy...  <br />Good Lord! BUY this cd!<br />Michael<BR>New Orleans
B00005RY7X|4.0|... What is this album all about in the first place? It's about having a good time doing what you dig, being yourself. This is just like a ramones album with a very layered guitar sound which makes the album sound really loud. Its pretty damn simple and formulaic. And the thing is that no one is trying to trick ye of little faith. Sure, its not Metallica's Master of Puppets or Cinderella. Thank God!!! Its a good old pop rock/punk record driven by keyboards and guitars (lots and lots of guitars.) Not brilliant by most standards, but why not just enjoy yourself once and a while?
B00006HBUA|1.0|the only funny thing about this movie was scooby doo, they need to keep this one a cartoon. I hope they don't make any more of them.......stupid....
B00006CXXU|5.0|and I'm glad...so glad she took her time to make this album. <br />This entire album is a testament to the fact that talent, true talent is the key to longevity.  Her vocal prowress and, yes her song writing ability are just phenomenal.  She has truly shed the bubble gum pop trappings of yester-year and is showcasing to the world who she really is...Christina Aguilera.<br />There are 20 tracks on this album...and each one is like a part of a journey that she takes us on.  From the beginning with \\"Stripped\\", \\"Can Hold us Down\\", \\"Walk Away\\", and \\"Fighter\\"...you can see her struggle to break free from the bubble gum/Britney clone image she was burdened with.  In \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", \\"Impossible\\", \\"Underappreciated\\"...you can see her maturity/growth as a young woman in love...and in loss.  Also impressive to me is the way she expresses herself in \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\"...both songs talking about how despite what others may say or do, that you must trust yourself, and see the beauty inside of yourself...to love yourself. But what really blew me away was the hardest song on this album for her to make, \\"I'm Ok\\"...a message to her father about his abusive relationship with her mother...and how it affected her as a child and now as a woman.<br />The title of the album \\"Stripped\\" really is appropriate.  You are getting the real deal here...no pop...no pretense...just one amazing album from a woman with an incredible voice.  She is truly talented.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Fans of teen pop should take notice. The pure pop sounds of \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" are long gone and the young lady with the powerful pipes that burst onto the scene in 1999 is a changed woman. Stripped, is an appropriate title for Christina Aguilera's first album of new English-speaking material since her 1999 debut. On the opening intro Aguilera states, \\"So here it is, no hype, no gloss, no pretense, just me...stripped.\\" <BR>    There are times when the album clearly misses. The albums first single, \\"Dirrrty,\\" just doesn't fit. Whereas much of the album is devoted to Christina dealing with the publics backlash of her image and dealing with the hate and blows to her self-esteem, \\"Dirrrty,\\" is chronicles the sexual romp of Christina and her posse and sounds like something that belongs more on a Destiny's Child album then on this collection. Other lowlights include \\"Infatuation\\" and \\"Underappreciated\\", they just sound uninspired and like they were included on the CD as more of an afterthought. With the album having over twenty tracks and being over 71 minutes in length, these tracks could have easily been shelved.<BR>     Despite the inclusion of a few lackluster tracks, Stripped does succeed on many levels. Aguilera takes the reigns, and penned almost all of the 20 tracks included. Standouts include \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Beautiful,\\" and \\"Make Over.\\" One of the highlights is a song called \\"I'm OK.\\" This song chronicles Christina's journey as a little girl and being in the midst of a volatile relationship between her parents. On \\"I'm OK\\" Christina sings, \\"Bruises fade father/but the pain remains the same/I still remember how you kept me so afraid/strength is my mother/for all the love she gave/Every morning that I wake/ I look back at yesterday and I'm OK.\\" Another standout track is the Alicia Keyes collaboration \\"Impossible.\\" The track is reminiscent of the music of Stevie Wonder and it's soaring vocals and the incredible piano playing of Keyes provide an upbeat soon-to-be hitsong.   <BR>     Christina's voice is clearly a force to be reckoned with. In many of the songs, the power and timbre of her voice is such that the music and lyrics fade into oblivion and the focus is placed on her amazing vocal chops. What is surprising is the fact that on several of the tracks Christina abandons her vocal acrobatics for a more raw and unforced sound. These moments are when we truly get a glimpse of the talent possessed by Ms. Aguilera.<BR>     While Britney recently sung about not yet being a woman, Christina clearly asserts her womanhood. It seems that most of the album is spent trying to convince listeners that she is not a pop-princess and has gained control of her career. While it has it's moments that are great, Stripped spends too much of its time focusing on similar subject matter. It is a step in the right direction for this young vocalist, but not quite all that it could have been.
0767802624|5.0|Excellent story, casting, director, and music. Quite honestly one of the best SciFi movies in recent years. Original story adds to the fun. Most people knew that the Air Force conducted investigation Blue Book and sent around men in black suits to ask questions about UFOs. Now we see what is a movie poking fun at what that could have led to. Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, and Rip Torn are a great combo in this bug hunting techno comedy. Has a good deal of replayability so it is well worth having on DVD.
B000021XS0|5.0|I'd heard a ton of praise for Dream Theater on this site, particularly from people whose opinions I tend to respect, but I'd always been a bit leary of them, because I don't have much progressive stuff.(Before this album the only prog-metal bands I had were Opeth and Tool, and some progressively inclined (power)thrash, like Iced Earth and earlier Metallica, as well as some artier alternative bands, like Smashing Pumpkins and Radiohead) So I guess I was a little concerned that parts of it might be a bit tedious in my mind, since it's a, I dunno, pretty hardcore progressive rock/metal album. This couldn't have been further from the truth. Though this album is ambitious enough that it isn't completely flawless, the good parts of this album are brilliant enough that they completely overshadow any problems I might have had with it.<br />Everyone Dream Theater review includes a section were the writer raves about Dream Theater's sheer technical ability. This is not with out good reason. The basic unit of a rock/metal band is as strong as you could ever hope for. Mike Portnoy is considered to be one of the, if not the, best drummer of the modern era. Though his work here isn't as impressvie as on their next album, he is still perfect for this album. He fits the music perfectly and provides a perfect basis for it. He plays excellent, interesting and well varied patterns, and never over-drums, so to speak, which he easily could. He's especially good on the final track, and on Beyond This Life. Myung is an equally brilliant bass player. He's stunningly fast and intricate, and is especially strong on Home and on his solo on Dance of Eternity.(One reviewer said something like, \\"Myung has a bass solo that would make Cliff Burton rise from the dead and pump his fist.\\" That's about right) Great as those two are, John Petrucci really stands out. His leads on this album are the best of any album I own, bar none. They're lighting fast much of the time, like on Fatal Tragedy, and somewhat slower and more evocative on on The Spirit Carries On, and always brilliant. His rhythm work is great too. Home has got some of his best work, with smooth, swirling wah-peddle twinged riffs alongside straight power-chord pounding. Some people think he over does it occasionally. I, personally, am never bored by the long instrumental section and this cd, particularly the guitars. My one problem with the guitars is in the mix, where they are occasionally not as prominent as they should be, particularly on the heavier parts. The rest of the band isn't as good, but is still solid. James Labrie's high voice works very, very well on the softer songs, and generally is pretty good for the heavier parts, though it would be nice if his voice had more aggression and more of an edge to it when it needed one. He also sings annoyingly high occasionally, and his vocals while portraying the female character, Victoria, can be a bit... odd. Still, despite a few quirks, and some time to get used to him, he is quite good. Rudess' keyboards are a bit of a mixed-bag, as is to be anticipated considering my general distaste for keyboards in rock, and especially metal. His use of the piano is great, and almost always works well, but I don't care for all of the syth effects. Much of the time the use of the 'boards is excellent, sometimes it is quite unfortunate, though these parts are often over shadowed by the guitar, which is nice. I don't know anything about playing the keyboards, and the different settings, but suffice to say that I don't like some of them much.  Still, after a couple of listens, most of the unusual keyboard styles cease to bother me much, and it is frequently great.<br />This is a concept album, though I'm not going to go into the plot, as everyone else has done this already. As far as the quality of the lyrics go, they are occasionally not very good, and never really particularly good, but any one who cares about this should just get over it. These lyrics certainlyaren't on the level of Limp Bizkit/Andrew W.K./Every rapper ever, so just get over it and listen to how great the music sounds.<br />Awesome though this album is, there is one track that I don't much care for, which is Through Her Eyes. ... particularly the horrible moaning at the beginning. The rest of the album is so good that I don't really even notice that song to much. Strange Deja Vu and Fatal Tragedy are strong, 70's hard-rock, with some nice piano thrown in on Fatal Tragedy, and some awesome solos. Beyond This Life is thrash with some crazy keyboards and some nice softer parts and more awesome solos. Home is the slower, brooding and building track with eastern sounds to it, an excellent chorus, particularly strong bass playing, great keyboard effects and, surprise, more great soloing.(I REALLY like the guitars on this cd.) It is probably the single best track on the cd. The Spirit Carries On is a much better ballad than Through Her Eyes, with a great, slow building up of the different parts leading up the the transcendent ending. The closer, Finally Free, is also brilliant, and near schizophrenic in it's scope, from brooding solo piano to up-beat hard rock to anthemic dream pop to pounding, doom-laden metal, with great vocals and drumming through out, and surprisingly effective use of sound effects intended to portray the story of the album.<br />The whole album is simply stunning. Go buy it now.aren't on the level of Limp Bizkit/Andrew W.K./Every rapper ever, so just get over it and listen to how great the music sounds.<br />Awesome though this album is, there is one track that I don't much care for, which is Through Her Eyes. ... particularly the horrible moaning at the beginning.

6305508550|5.0|this movie is the funniest movie ever...it is so true to the normal working enviroment......it will make u laugh for sure...
B00006V9A0|5.0|... There is only ONE thing to do if you have been waiting for YEARS, like the rest of us, for the release of this album: JUST BUY IT! ... You will NOT be disappointed. It SOUNDS great. ... I have NO idea what kind of mastering magic the great Bob Ludwig of Gateway Mastering Studios ( now in Portland, Maine ) may have applied to the original, multi-track, analog, master-tapes of all of these songs ( if he even HAD them to work with! ), but whatever he did ( 24 Bit / 96 kHz - or even higher - sampling rates used to digitally remaster original 2-track stereo mixes, or some other crafty use of precision, studio wizardry? ), it WORKS! These songs JUMP OUT at you, sound fresh and clean, and sing in your head like new-born flowers in Spring! All of these songs - SONICALLY - sound BETTER here than on their original releases. Just listen with superior quality headphones, and you will HEAR what I am talking about. ...<br />... As for the MUSIC itself? ... Man, it ROCKS like an avalanche off Mount Rushmore and the Black Hills during an apocalyptic revenge of the spirit of Crazy Horse! ...  I have seen a LOT of bands in my life - but seeing NIRVANA play live in the Fall of 1993 during the IN UTERO tour, at the Fitchburg Civic Center in Fitchburg, Massachusetts with my good buddy and fellow bandmate, Johnny Butler, was one of the greatest thrills of my life. Those guys ROCKED!!! They were just as good live - if not BETTER - than on record. I can vouch for that with unquestionable certainty. ...<br />... A big, fat THANK YOU to Krist, Dave, and Courtney for putting aside all the political nonsense and allowing this music to be presented to the public in all its raw power and simple beauty. ... The only regret I have, retrospectively, is that IN UTERO was not left alone and untouched and allowed to be released in its entirety the way Steve Albini had originally recorded the band in his sacred and simple way that he had intended on capturing them. They could have always re-mixed the songs later - as they did here for this album - and released the alternate mixes on future BOX SETS, like the one we are all STILL passionately waiting for. In any case, this is absolutely a wonderful, little treat of a Greatest Hits album with the perfect simple title: NIRVANA. ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid
B00000064E|5.0|I have to give this album simply 5 stars. Not that I love every track just as much, but most songs are so incredibly beautiful that it's impossible not to give them so much credit.<br />I've only been into Nick Drake for a few months. After hearing about him and listening to his album, I thought it was just boring ol' folkmusic and left it for what it was. But for some reason I typed in his name in a MP3-search program and ended up with a CD-R full of songs. A new world opened, which sounds exaggerated, but is not.<br />I can't say what my favorite album is, as every album has it's own charms, but Five Leaves Left is the best to start with, as it was his debut-album. There are songs on it which touch me so deeply that there are times that I just can't listen to them. Them being 'Day is Done' and 'Fruit Tree'. The album is filled with melancholy, but these songs breathe out a type of sadness I've never heard in any other music.<br />'River Man', maybe his most famous song after 'Pink Moon', is arguably his greatest song ever. The brooding string-arrangement lifts the song to great heights. It's unbelievable. <br />The only songs that are hard for me to hear are 'Mary Jane' and 'Man in a shed'. Not because they're not good; but I got to know them in the acoustic version (as on 'Time Of No Reply'), which I like MUCH better than these versions, all dressed up with unnecessary arrangements.<br />If you haven't discovered Nick Drake, now is the time to do so. He has enriched my life; I'm addicted to his music.

B000009QPE|5.0|I was kinda unsure whether or not to pick up this album or not, but I said \\"what the heck\\" and purchase it and I have not let it out of my CD player ever since. This album rocks, period! I mean even the production is great, the guitars have a harsh sound to them, not a fuzzy sound as in Sepultura's \\"Beneath the Remains\\" (even though \\"Beneath The Remains\\" is a great album too) and you can hear the bass very well. Tom's singing is great here too, I mean the way how \\"Angel of Death\\" starts out with him screaming is a way to \\"get the party started\\" in a manner of speaking, it really sets the attitude of the album very well. In conclusion, those who don't have this album should'nt be listening to metal anyways! (j/k)<br />Stand out tracks: \\"Angel of Death\\", \\"Piece by Piece\\", \\"Criminally Insane\\", and \\"Raining Blood\\"
B00005JL2O|5.0|This movie when i saw it with my best friend we were laughing like never before that is the funniest and most expected movie in in all Asia and Europe if were you i would buy it.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I'm almost ashamed to admit it now, but before i heard this cd, i thought Britney Spears's, BRITNEY was actually a good album. I thought it was real and mature. But now that i have heard Christina's album, Britney's cd makes me want to laugh til I cry, because it is so obvious that Britney is trying to grow, but she's still just a little girl. Christina Aguilera is a woman who can sing about life exspieriences because shes expierienced things. This is a wonderful cd, and if you didn't like Christina's first cd, then put it completley out of your mind and get this album, because there is so much growth here, i can't believe it has only been 3 years since her last album. Like how she dresses or not, this album shows that Christina Aguleria knows exactly what a womans about.
B00005IC2H|5.0|like a drifting moaning ocean of glisten- this record simply exists in its own dimension- the vocalist is like a seperate instrument - the icelandic lyrics add to the mystery of the experience, making it somehow more meaningful and beyond any description- this is the soundtrack to evaporating flesh- entering the listener into unexplored tonal throbs and undertow panic
6304493681|3.0|On the one hand, you've got some of the best visuals the world of animation has seen, occasionally interesting ideas, and a thought provoking ending. On the other, you've got an unbelievably cluttered plot and utterly pretentious dialogue. Overall, the goods outdo the bads, making this a good enough film, though nothing compared with some other anime movies.
B00003CXB2|5.0|You wouldn't want to miss any of this classic.  Especially if you have a DVD player and can watch it in widescreen format.<BR>This is easily one of the most beautiful films ever made.  The scenes are photographed spectacularly.  David Lean had the eye of an artist, and it shows in his films.  The desert is a major character in the film and it is both beautiful and hellish.<br />The acting is top-notch throughout.  Peter O'Toole's breakthrough performance as T.E. Lawrence is something to behold, and he's in almost every scene.  He goes from the gumpy-frumpy, cartographer Lieutenant in the English army to a legendary Arab military leader who helped free the Arabs land from the Turks during WWI.  The supporting cast includes a number of actors who were stars and soon-to-be stars, including Claude Rains, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, and Jose Ferrer.  Also significant is the almost total lack of females in the film.  We briefly see a few nurses and the silhouettes of some Bedouin women, but no central female characters.<br />The music also plays a large part in the experience.  The score by Maurice Jarre is grand and perfect for the film.  And it all sounds great in updated Dolby Digital audio.<BR> <BR>The word that best describes this film has to be spectacular.  The cinematography.  The acting.  The story.  The score.  It was originally released in 1962.  Sometimes the age is obvious in films like this, but Lawrence holds up so well, it has to be considered timeless.  It's awesome to watch and a must-have for film lovers.  The extras include a good hour+ documentary.
0440219078|5.0|This little book is titled \\"The Giver,\\" but the message is easily received.  It is written for young readers, but the message is timely for most adults as well.  Recognizing that this book has a young audience in mind, it is not surprising that the \\"message\\" is somewhat in your face.  You don't have to take a college course in philosophy to figure out what Lois Lowry is trying to say.  But that doesn't mean there isn't plenty to think about...there is!  In the perfect little world of sameness that the story takes place, the ideas of knowledge, history, personal choice, diversity, death (and others) are considered bad and not useful for a successful society.  The result seems, on the surface, to work just fine, but you discover that their denial is so great that they don't even see the deepest, darkest secrets of their own existence.  They can't!  Not because they're blind, not because they're brain damaged, but because their paradigms are so carefully shaped for them that they don't even know to ask certain questions.  Only one member of the community at a time has any knowledge of the dark side of their collective experience, the Receiver of Memories.  <br />As engaging as the story is, it is also timely.  Looking at my religious tradition, I can see elements of this story all over it.  Looking at other fundamentalist movements, I see the same thing.  Everywhere you look you see movements to reduce our personal choices and freedom, denying and re-shaping history to fit our wants rather reflecting reality.  It's all packaged by those who claim special or even divine knowledge that they \\"know what is best for us, even though we, ourselves, cannot see it.\\"  Like sheep we follow, and that following results in such tragedies as the Mountain Meadows Massacre in our own western history, the Jonestown massacres, the Branch Dividians, and most recently the spate of Islamic terrorism that spans the globe.  Each act is perpetrated by well-meaning followers who have sacrificedtheir personal freedoms, their personal choice, their personal knowledge, their personal awareness for good of the society, only to find that sacrifice of self equals sacrifice of society.  <br />This is a great little book, and one well worth the three hours it takes to read (though the premis is nothing new...it borrows shamelessly from other Utopian themes, such as B.F. Skinner's \\"Walden Two\\").  My copy is a \\"Readers Circle\\" copy, with discussion questions included.  I strongly recomend reading this book with a group of others and discussing it together.  The message will be that much more profound!

B000066NW0|4.0|Avril has gotten glowing reviews for writing her own music and speaking out against cookie cutter teeny-pop stars.  She has also tapped danced on many people's nerves for her self-proclamation of her &quot;punk&quot; status, a faux pas in and of itself.  So is she original, or a poser?<br />She's a step in the right direction.  She may not be punk, but her music is full of raw nerve lyrics and moving progressions.  In her North American high school world, lets face it, she's a seventeen year old punk among the Britney bubble gum worshipers.  In the larger world?  No, not punk, just a musician with enough edge to let us like her.  Songs like &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; hook listeners with it's pop/punk sound, while wistful songs like \\"I'm With You\\" deliver songs that are too often lacking in the world of MTV, that is, songs that have thought and feeling behind them.<br />I didn't buy this CD because I wanted something \\"punk\\".  I bought it because I liked what I had heard so far.  This is not a punk CD; this is a debut by a promising singer.  Give her some time, age, and experience and she will  probably retract her punk claims and develop her own style.  In the meantime, listen to the sample tracks, and buy this because it is a worthwhile pop/rock CD.<br />Besides, what other mainstream star will stand up to those purely Pop Princesses?

I was intrigued by the political and media aspects surrounding the space program which I was too young to have known about.  Alan Bean's trip to the moon was presented in a wonderfully hilarious way.  And the characters had depth with common-man heroics as well as failings.<br />Do yourself a favor, and get a copy of this DVD to watch, learn and enjoy.
B000006YYM|5.0|For those of you who don't know, Gentle Giant is an indescribable and unique melding of jazz, rock, classical, english folk music and a number of other musical genres. This is one of the essential albums from a period where they could do no wrong as a progressive rock band. Their best albums are: Power and the Glory, Freehand, and Octopus. The next best (still better than 99% of what was produced during this time period) are Interview and In a Glass House. But any studio albums they recorded up to and including Interview are worth owning. There is also a live album called Playing the Fool that is mostly of interest for completists. 8/18/2004 update: apologies to those readers with delicate sensibilities who bought this cd on my recommendation. I failed to mention in my initial review that some of the music here is incredibly dissonant and difficult (for example, So Sincere, IMHO the high point of the album). Less adventurous listeners would be better off starting off with Freehand, then Octopus before trying The Power and the Glory.
B0000013GT|5.0|this is my number.1 cd, Outkast have and never will produce something like this again.
B00000JMOF|5.0|This is one of the first film adaptations of the Frankenstein novel by Mary Shelly, and one of the best. It portrays a scientist named Henry Frankenstein, isolated and obsessed over his strange experiments. He and his assistant Fritz, dig up dead bodies and use their parts to build a new human body. They end up stealing a criminal brain to use in their creation. Finally they bring it to life, even though Henry's wife, and friends warn this is not an affair humans should be involved with, they say leave creation for God. The monster eventually escaped and terrorizes the village, as they hunt for him. Frankenstein made this monster with his own hands, and now must destroy him. <br />This film is a classic, and is highly enjoyable. One of the first horror/science fiction films ever made, and has influences many others. The acting is great, and direction superb. The film is very fun to watch, and is quite risque for the time it was made. All film lovers should see this. I had no problems with it at all. 5 stars.
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black is one of the best AC/DC albums with Brian Johnson ever made.If your more of a Bon Scott fan like I am,I think you'll love this album which is known as one of the best rock n roll albums of all time.Every song on the album is awesome,HellsBells,Shoot to thrill,Back in Black,you shook me all night long,Rock n roll ain't noise pollution,given the dog a bone.I love this album,next to that one I would have to suggest to purchase,Thunderstruck,which is an awesome album as well.Back in Black is awesome buy it today!!
B00006LLNU|4.0|It was quite by chance that I stumbled across Sigur R&oacute;s about 10 months ago. I was trying to find more information about fellow Icelandians m&uacute;m and found an mp3 of &quot;&Aacute;gætis Byrjun&quot;, the title track from their last album. One listen and I was hooked.<br />Since then, &Aacute;gætis Byrjun has easliy established itself as one of my favourite albums and the distinguishing feature of having been listened to until the band got around to releasing their next album!<br />Upon first listening to () I must admit to being a little disappointed. I think I was secretly wishing for &Aacute;gætis Byrjun all over again, which () isn't. It is a much slower and more comtemplative album than its predecessor and not something that is easy to appreciate in one sitting.<br />I've had () for a little over a week now and it has tunneled itself into my dreams and quiter waking moments. I'm not sold on all of the tracks yet, but track 3, with its exquisite 5-bar piano melody is truly sublime. Tracks 1, 4 and 8 are also standouts for me. I'm less fond of tracks 6 and 7 as they are form the heavier part of the album with massive washes of layered guitar and a driven urgency. That's not to say they aren't great, I'm just partial to the slower stuff.<br />Sigur R&oacute;s and () have reminded me once again of why I listen to and enjoy music so much, a sentiment that's best summed up by a passsage from Hesse's &quot;Glass Bead Game&quot;: &quot;for after all music is nothing but an act of courage, a serene, smiling, striding forward and dancing through the terrors and flames of the world, the festive offering of a sacrifice&quot;.
B00005JH9W|5.0|This film about the lives of circus sideshow \\"freaks\\" was considered too horrific to view in its day, but it is a true must-see for all.  There was a time in the past of the west, in the present of many places elsewhere in the world, when those born into bodies that were not \\"right\\" in some way were left to the elements, killed, or in cases as portrayed in this movie -- left to a life in circus sideshows. <BR>This movie shows a small glimpse into a world where the \\"freaks\\" are outcast even by many of the circus folks that they travel with.  For those that keep track of the more famous sideshow members, they will see some familiar faces like Schlitze and Johnny Eck.  For those who have never paid much attention to such matters, it is an enlightening movie about how different things are now for those in the world of western medicine compared to \\"back then\\".<BR>While there are a few romantic subplots surrounding the central tale of Hans and his love for Cleopatra \\"Peacock of the Air\\", and her plans of deceit and coniving in regard to him -- the main focal point of the movie is the \\"code of the freaks\\".  Such codes exist in just about any subculture that must defend itself when forced to interact with a host culture that views it as abhorrent.<BR>While many a piece has been written and even committed to film about the humanity of \\"freaks\\" and \\"monsters\\", such as the legendary tales of the hunchback of Notre Dame or of  Frankenstien, none can show the true human beauty within as well as the real-life sideshow \\"freaks\\" themselves.  Beauty truely is in the eye of the beholder.<BR>It is not surprising that people left the theaters screaming when this movie was first released, as they were indeed contemporary to the woman in the opening scene of the movie who screams and swoons.  While the members of the human genome project look forward to the promising end of various genetic abnormalities, they still pull their hair out as to how much tampering is ethical and humane.<BR>Welive in a time where outward physical beauty is objectified and pursued at all costs by society at large, but if one has also seen movies the likes of \\"Gattica\\" -- one has to ask themselves in light of *this* movie -- what means and what ends are reasonable and ethical?  Even if one is born in a less than \\"perfect\\" body, it does not mean that they are not beautiful or human.  They feel and they bleed red just like the rest of us.  Tod Browning's masterpiece \\"Freaks\\" captures these points quite succinctly.  <BR>As to the technical side of the movie -- while current-day viewers may say that the actors seem to be overacting or underacting in various places, one must remember that the style of acting itself has changed greatly since the days when people would run screaming from the sight of a sideshow \\"freak\\" regardless of whether they were 5 feet away or portrayed on film.<BR>There isn't a terrible amount of makeup in this movie, and special effects are quite limited indeed, but when you have over a dozen real live sideshow folk who indeed perform their \\"abilities\\" throughout the course of the scenes they appear within -- any more special effects than were actually used would have detracted too much from the movie.
B00003BDXG|5.0|The Oscar winning Oliver Stone directed this, in a very strange style, with quick cuts, fancy angles, black and white, neon colors, animation, alternate backgrounds, etc. It may take awhile to get used to for some, but it makes the film very stylish. The film is about two lovers who go on killing people in towns along a desert highway. Of course the media make them stars, and they are the talk of the country. Every channel covers their story, and books are written about them. They are finally caught, and are soon to be executed. But a high profile TV show host, realizes the kinda money he can make, having a last interview with them. <br />The acting is good, as well is the script. The film has a lot of funny parts. Its an interesting story about how two murderous people, find a way to stop. But what the film is really about is how the media, and public eat these crime stories up, and constantly talk about, and watch them. For a lot of people it may hit to close to home, and a lot of this film will offend many. There is a lot of violence, and language. It also doesn't have your classic Hollywood ending. Like the main character says, this is the 90s (now 21st century), and the truth isn't always what is right.<br />This disc also has deleted scenes, including an alternate ending with commentary by the director. There is also an interesting documentary, and audio commentary. Like I said this film is not for most people, but for those not afraid of alternative films that criticize what is popular (and hypocritical), this will be a treat. Good satire, even though the directing may make you a little dizzy afterwards, I highly recommend this, 5 stars.
B00000DC4A|3.0|Bryan Adams seems to have a roller coaster ride of a career.  He becomes big, then disappears, then reappears, only to disappear again.  &quot;Reckless&quot; is still my BA fav.  &quot;On A Day Like Today&quot; starts out incredibly strong.  And by the time I got to the track &quot;When You're Gone&quot;, I began to think this could be BA's best album.  But it wasn't.  The first half of the album is great.  &quot;How Do You Feel Tonight&quot; and &quot;Getaway&quot; prove that BA is still one of the best pop rockers around.  But the second half of the album falls pretty flat.  And there doesn't seem to be a stand-out rock ballad like on most of his others albums.  A decent album which starts off well, and then collapses in the end.
0790729725|1.0|Awesome film BUT the DVD is pretty much unwatchable, you cannot hear the dialog track over the background sound. I would return it - but I already opened it.
B00005N9CV|1.0|This recording is desperately flat. You can't hear any difference in between the different titles.<BR>Great for a hotel lobby were you don't notice the music!<br />Listen to Stacey Kent's versions and you think of suing Diana for running great songs.<br />I must say the cover looks great in my case logic these legs deserve *****.
0767830555|5.0|Robert De Niro gives a brilliant performance of a man pushed to the edge in the corrupt big city, that he takes the law into his own hands. Travis is a taxi driver by night, and he encounters many different types of criminals: murderers, robbers, prostitutes, etc. He's getting more and more sick of it. He tries to start a relationship, but it fails, and he looses all hope of there being a decent human in the city. When he sees a young prostitute wasting her life away, he decides to try to help her, anyway he can, and he chooses the violent way. How will a violent world react when he strikes out? The film is masterly directed by Martin Scorsese, who has a unique style. The script is top notch, and deals with many contemporary issues, and posses great insight into the mindset of young angry individuals offended, and rejected by the world. If you like any other films with Robert De Niro you will love this film. People who appreciate top notch film making will get a lot out of this film. This is considered a classic, and I'm not surprised. Great story, great acting, and great directing, 5 stars. If your afraid of sensitive issues, such as violence, or negativity in the world, stay away.
B000002LK1|5.0|Some hardcore DM fans that I know of didn't like this album when it came out, because of it's popularity.  I kept hearing &quot;DM sold out&quot;.  Well... I disagree.  Some of their best and most creative material spawned from this album.  Had anyone heard a song like &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; before?  With that infectious guitar pattern and stomp like percussion.  &quot;Enjoy The Silence&quot; and &quot;Policy Of Truth&quot; became big radio hits, but other tracks such as &quot;Halo&quot;, &quot;World In My Eyes&quot; and &quot;Clean&quot; are just as good, if not better.  Martin Gore seems to be at his songwriting peak here.  Alan Wilder musical produces some wonderful moments, which always compliment Martin's songs.  Dave's vocals sound more confident and refined than any other DM album.   A solid work from one of the best electronic bands in history.
B00005JJX8|5.0|To Catch A Thief is great.  It does not enjoy the critical acclaim of some other Hitchcock films - its target was a broader commercial appeal.  But I'm a big Cary Grant and Grace Kelly fan, and the chemistry between them was terrific.  Also, an excellent Hitchcock blend of humor and story line twist.  Highest marks.
B000035Z3K|3.0|Wow. With so much praise I expected this film to rock. I'm sorry to say I was very much disappointed. This is the story of Dracula, based on the novel by Bram Stoker. Renfield goes to Translevania to sell property to Dracula, but Dracula turns him into a vampire. They then travel to England, where he is put into a sanitarium, and Dracula terrorizes the town. Dracula eventually goes after a girl named Mina, and mixes his blood with hers. Mina's friends and family then try to save her soul, and kill Dracula. <br />This film is not scary, spooky, eerie, strange, gothic, and has no suspense. The story is not told in a good way, and the pacing feels awkward. The film feels dry, and campy. Dracula is not scary, he just seems silly. The film doesn't have much depth. The best character is Renfield, who Dwight Frye acted superbly, as the insane follower of Dracula. I loved other classic monster films such as Frankenstein and The Wolf Man, but this film did not interest me very much. If you want to see a good vampire film I recommend Nosferatu (1922) very much. That film has style, substance, and is scary. I'll give Dracula 3 stars because it made the vampire very popular, and started the monster series, but it didn't do much for me.
B000002MJC|4.0|Following up such a popular and great album as &quot;Violator&quot; I'm sure was no easy task.  This album's debut was at #1, but I feel that was atrributed to the hard-core fans and success of the last album.  &quot;SOFAD&quot;, was somewhat of a disappointment when I first heard it.  The songs and production values turned from heavy electronic, to more rock and gospel oriented tracks.  What was going on?  Why did DM decide to do this?  Well this happens to be one of those rare albums that actually came back to bite me.  I really like it now.  My prejudice after first hearing it went away, and I now enjoy it for the work it is.  &quot;Rush&quot; and &quot;Get Right With Me&quot; are sleeper tracks that I really enjoy.  &quot;One Caress&quot; sounds better than most Broadway Songs that are in NY today.  &quot;I Feel You&quot; and &quot;Mercy In You&quot; are hard hitting rockers.  The one song I still don't seem to get or like is &quot;In My Room&quot;.  But the rest of the album is a winner.
B00006V9A0|1.0|This is nothing more then a cd with one new song and 13 others that you've heard time and time again.<BR>If any of you are true Nirvana fans and know anything about the \\"Hole\\" battle over the rights to Nirvana's music and the rest of Kurt Cobain's estate, you shouldn't by this cd. ...No one should buy this cd. <BR>This cd is a joke. Don't get me wrong, every track on it has well earned it's spot on a greatest hits cd. But aside from You Know You're Right, more then likely you own the original cd's that the songs were on to begin with. If you don't, then that's were your money should go. As far as You Know You're Right, it's as beautiful and powerful as any of their prior songs. Knowing it was recorded just months before Kurt's death gives it even more meaning and emotion. But...<BR>What do you think Kurt would have done? Do you think he would buy it? Hell no! He'd download the new track off the internet like the rest of us and give the finger to the corporate losers who's pockets will continue to swell if you give in and buy this cd.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This new Nirvana CD, appropriately titled \\"Nirvana\\", comes almost six years to the day that the last official Nirvana release, From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishkah, was released. While the songs on it are of good selection (the digitally remastered sound makes them sound much more cleaner and fresher than the previously released versions, including the new song \\"You Know You're Right\\", which is considered the last recorded gem by the band), the CD is chronically too short. There's only about 50 minutes of music on the disc in total - and that gives you room for at least another half hour or so of additional music (CD's hold about 80 minutes of music), and one has to wonder why the song selection ended abruptly at 14 and is so short, when many \\"Best-of\\" compilations normally fill up the enitre disc and have (generally) as many as 20 or so tracks, which could have been done here easily.<br />So, keeping all this in mind, overall, I'd probably reccommend this, if you want a good but frustratingly brief overview of Nirvana's short but sweet career. As an introduction, it does its job well enough to keep a new fan hungry for more, which is what the disc is designed for in the first place. <br />While hardcore fans may quibble over the track selections (most Nirvana fans seem to agree that the MTV Unplugged version of \\"About A Girl\\" is definetly superior to the Bleach version, and others wonder why \\"Been A Son\\" was included on this compilation), I think that we all can agree that Nirvana was a great band, and you really couldn't go wrong with any selections to put on here. There should be a little something here to satisfy everyone.
B00005J9LZ|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite of all of the PSB albums.  Why?  Because every song on this baby is great.  And it's so hard to believe considering that every song sounds different from one another.  Albums like &quot;Please&quot;, &quot;Very&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; have moments where you're not sure what song you're listening to.  &quot;It's A Sin&quot; is a dark and gothic song.  And leave it up to the boys to deal with religious undertones in a catchy pop song.  &quot;One More Chance&quot; is a wonderful opener and leads us straight into their big hit &quot;What Have I Done To Deserve This?&quot;.  &quot;Shopping&quot; always felt like a sequel to &quot;Opportunities&quot; for me, which is light and fun.  However it happens to be &quot;Rent&quot; and the closing number &quot;King's Cross&quot; that send shivers up my spine.  &quot;It Couldn't Happen Here&quot; also demonstrates that the boys would have no problem writing a successful Broadway Musical.
B00005JKCH|1.0|what can i say? this movie is horrible! the script, plot, and special effects are the worst i've ever seen in a 'blockbuster' movie.  when you compare this film to other films inspired by comicbooks such as the first batman film, x-men, and the first superman film, you will see that spider-man just dosn't hold up.  maybe your little 12 year old brother would like it since he wouldn't know a good movie ...- which i think is why this movie grossed as much as it did.
B000002GGU|5.0|&quot;Reckless&quot; is still one of my favorite pop-rock albums.  It's one of those rare albums where you can tell the band is having way too much fun, and yet the songs are really good and infectious.  The opening riff to &quot;Run To You&quot; always make me shiver, it's that cool.  I'm suprised the opening track, &quot;One Night Love Affair&quot; wasn't a big hit from this album.  probably because there were already so many singles and great songs.  From &quot;Summer Of 69'&quot; to &quot;Heaven&quot;.  And then to top all of this off, B.A. shares the spotlight with Tina Turner on &quot;It's Only Love&quot;, and the song just kicks.  A definitive album from a great pop-rocker.  This shouldn't be missed.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Lots of bombs going off. Lots of guys getting shot and dying. Three Navajo indians call in an air stike. More bombs going off. More guys getting shot and dying. Marine picks a fist fight with another Marine in a battle zone (yeah, that could happen). <br />More bombs going off. More guys getting shot and dying. I turned it off and tried to dream up a way to get a refund. I think that about sums up this lame movie.<br />I agree with another reviewer: There was a good story here somewhere, I just never came out of hiding before I gave up on it.
B00005J9M3|4.0|Like most singles and albums, I tend to like gems that were not released as singles.  &quot;Behaviour&quot; has it's share of them.  &quot;This Must Be The Place...&quot; is such a great PSB song.  I think the length of the title alone must be the reason why they didn't release it as a single.  &quot;Only The Wind&quot; and &quot;Nervously&quot; are slow haunting tracks, that pull you in.  I still don't know why &quot;The End Of The World&quot; wasn't a single, because it's such a catchy pop song.  The one track that I just can't get into is &quot;Being Boring&quot;. And I know most PSB fans really like it.  I think Harold Faltymeyer (Axel F) produced this album, but it's hard to tell because &quot;Behaviour&quot; feels like an extension of &quot;Actually&quot; which was produced by Stephen Hague.  Nice follow up.
B000060MY6|5.0|...and the best. My favorite film.<BR> <BR> David Lynch's latest masterpiece, as well as my favorite film, is one that you definitely have to think about for a while to figure it out, if you figure it out at all.<br /> Although it is confusing, I have managed to figure it out for the most part. Mulholland Drive is the story of Diane,a young woman who has just moved to Hollywood. Soon after moving, she meets Camilla, another young actress, and falls in love with her. Meanwhile a director making a movie is told he has to hire Camilla Rhodes or he will be fired. Diane, who has gone out for the same part, is overcome with rage and jealousy and murders Camilla. She is overcome with grief. This all happens before the movie has even started. The movie starts in Diane's dream. Her name is now Betty and she has just moved to Hollywood to become an actress. She moves into the apartment her aunt gives her. After waking the first morning, she finds a woman with amnesia, calling herself Rita, in her shower. She came in in the middle of the night after a car accident. Soon before drunken teenagers hit Rita's car with theirs, Rita is threatened by her driver, who dies when they are hit. This resembles the guilt/denial that Diane feels, since Rita survives. Diane creates Rita as an alter-ego of Camilla. They soon fall in love. While trying to find out what Rita's real name is, they find her apartment with a dead girl inside. This resembles the dead Camilla Rhodes. Rita has a blue key and thousands of dollars in cash in her pocketbook. The money could be either money she recieves for a movie or money for having her killed, it doesn't reall matter because part of Mulholland Drive is the examination of a dream, and dreams are vague.. <br /> Meanwhile, Betty is persuing an acting job. The director of the movie is told he must pick a specific girl by his boss and by a mysterious cowboy, who you see later, after Diane awakes, showing how random elements of real life often appear in dreams. Her name is Camilla Rhodes. <br /> Rita uses this key she has found to open a mysterious blue box that randomly appears on the coffee table. That's where the dream ends. That's the seperation point. Now you are in the world of Diane. She is slowly delving further and further down a spiral of insanity. Then, she finally cracks. Then she gets shot. That's more or less where the movie ends.<br /> This is an overall excellent film with outstanding directing, imagery, acting, and symbolism. The definitive thinking man's film.<br />MULHOLLAND DRIVE(2001)<BR>DIRECTED BY DAVID LYNCH<BR>STARRING NAOMI WATTS, LAURA ELENA HARRING, AND JUSTIN THEROUX<BR>RATED R FOR VIOLENCE, LANGUAGE, AND SOME STRONG SEXUALITY
0385484518|5.0|The book that I chose to read for my independent reading assignment was \\"tuesdays with Morrie,\\" by Mitch Albom. This book is by far one of the best books that I have ever read. Not only do you get to read about two amazing characters Mitch and Morrie, but you get to learn one of lifes greatest lessons. The lesson being not to take things for granted. Morrie really represented a man who stood for what he believed in and helped everyone around him.<BR> I reccommend this book to anyone who has ever loss someone they loved or are in the process of watching someone they really care about die. For me I related to this book simply because my grandfather is Morrie's age and he is dying right now. I learned that you have to be there for them because they want someone to listen to what is going on in their lives. Morrie always wanted people to talk to him and come visit and that is how my grandfather is. After, reading this book I now realize just how precious life is and how you as an indiviual can have an affect on someone. With that being said I think everyone should own a copy of this book and then watch the movie to compare the two.

0679882820|2.0|Be warned!  These \\"Board Books\\" are not the same as the original versions of the Dr. Seuss classics, but are instead slightly changed versions of the same stories.  The normal Dr. Seuss books flow extremely well, provide interesting stories, and have beautiful cadence.  These \\"Board Books\\" illustrate very effectively why there was only one Dr. Seuss -- basically, the modifications that have been made to the stories make them much less compelling and educational.  In particular, the rhyming is never as good, and the meter is non-existent.  I will grant that the \\"Board Book\\" style is much more durable, as our child has torn a number of the classic Mr. Brown pages.  That having been said, I would still encourage you to buy the classic version of Mr. Brown instead of this one; its ISBN number is 0394806220.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Definitely among my favorites of my recently purchased CDs.  I purchased this primarily for the songs &quot;Objection Tango&quot; and &quot;Whenever, Whereever&quot;, and was surprised to find that I like the Spanish versions of these songs (particularly &quot;Suerte&quot; - Whenever, Wherever) as much as the English versions.  Another surprise was &quot;Rules&quot;, for me it's just fun to listen to.  Shakira gives us good, solid music that can be listened to over and over again at a time when too much of the music out there is just over-commercialized and not worth listening to.
B000067JBN|4.0|While no movie will ever be as moving as the original, they producers have outdone themselves. This movie is incredible. The special effects and makeup really bring to life the Morlocks and the actual machine is incredible. Truly a must have for any sci-fi nut.
B00005RFAI|3.0|Hmmm, this is a tough one for me to review.  The songs I like on this album, I REALLY like, but honestly I never even listened to the rest of the album, just couldn't get into it.  &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot; became a much listened to track for me; being a bit self destructive myself, it was as if Pink had somewhat shared my thoughts when she sang this song.  Parts of this album are a bit too much hard-driving rock for my taste, and I felt that it came off as being a bit commercial, rather than a showcase of real talent.
B00005JKG9|5.0|this movie is the equivalent of a strong pill for experiencing condensed life--ever changing asymmetry of the relationships and players' power therein, strong and realistic dialogue, situations and characters on the edge.<br />great casting (some reservations for baldwin) with pacino and lemmon (in whatever order) at their best. pacino delivers a role that's already become typical of his--nonetheless fits the character very well. by this point in lemmon's career we see him developing in an extremely fine and nuanced character. the rest of the cast complements smoothly the roles of the first two.<br />the only exception one may take with this movie realism is around the thickly liberal approach to business (in recession anyway.) otherwise, as an unintended consequence, this movie is so well done that one may substitute it for what sales is (not.)

B00005OLY5|5.0|The Lord of The Rings for younger audiences! A light fantasy full of magic, faeries, swords and monsters. Warwick Davis is a Hobbit-like reluctant hero who leaves his family and village on a quest to \\"do the right thing\\". Along the way he finds the \\"thief with a heart of gold\\" Val Kilmer (who does surprisingly well in the role) as they battle the evil queen to save the life of baby Elora Danan.<br />There is adventure, romance and humor for young and old. I've seen other reviews that say this and it's true: This is one of the few movies our 14 year old son will come out of hiding to watch with the family. If you have a young one (not TOO young, there is some blood and a scary monster) buy it and your family will be watching it for years to come!
0316666343|2.0|The idea of a ghost telling their life from the \\"afterlife\\" is overdone. No less the creepiness of a suspense novel based on rape & murder, from the very girl's point of view, doesn't lend a poignancy to her abbreviated life, but seems to capitalize more on the \\"mystery\\" of her demise and the suspense as to whether anyone else will \\"get it\\" before he is caught.

0451457994|5.0|In the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arthur C.

It may seem like an impossible problem, but thirty-four years ago there was born one very good answer.<br />The human species, as Clarke philosophizes, is a four million year experiment. Extraterrestrials are a key part of it, but ultimately 2001 is a story about the ways of humanity itself.  Without spaceships and space pods we could not have navigated the heavens, but in order to truly capture the human spirit we have to look beyond anything than can be seen, or touched.  The heart of it all is the human mind.  It's that simple philosophy that drives this epitome of science fiction from the plains of Africa to the fires of that red sun, somewhere beyond our galaxy.<br />The book should be read before watching the movie, I wholeheartedly agree.  I did the opposite; after watching the movie so many times, some of the book's effect was lost.  Read the book first so you can take in the subtle genius of the movie with a fine-tuned eye.  In any case, I loved both and they come very well recommended!
0553106635|5.0|After the suprising events in this book, I could only find myself saying one word when finished, \\"Wow\\". \\"A Storm of Swords\\" is full of so many plot twists that just when one thinks they know what is going on, something completely different happens and takes the reader by suprise. I will give Martin kudos for the fact that I only predicted a few events beforehand that actually happened. Many books nowdays are full of predictable work that is almost boring to read. The same can not be said for this book, or this series.<br />\\"A Storm of Swords\\" finally brings into play more of the life of the Black Brothers and the Wildlings. But don't be fooled, that isn't all that the book covers. Troubles in the Kingdoms are still being brought into play. We see more from Dany and learn everything there isn't what meets the eye. The Kings are all still fighting for control. <br />Deaths aplenty happen in this book, some more suprising than others. But that does not take away from the appeal of the book. There are a few characters that have died in the past books that I would rather not have been killed off, and this book is no exception. That is really the only problem I have with the book. But, I am willing to accept the deaths as part of the plot that is keeping this wonderful story moving along.<br />I was a little hesitant when I picked this series up first. It started off a little slow. But now...to me there is never a dull moment. The chapters flow together smoothly, and never once have I been bored. The action is incredible. The plots/subplots/subsubplots are simply amazing and intriguing. This book really brings to play many of the main characters. Finally we see more from Jaime's point of view. Samwell is another character that gets a POV in this book. <br />Since starting this series, I can probably rate it up to one of the best of all time in my opinion. It blows every other series I have read out of the water. George R.R. Martin is a great author and I look forward to his next book, which hopefully comes out soon. If \\"A Feast for Crows\\" (Supposedly the next book's title) is as good as this one and the ones before it, I will not hesitate to spend the money to add it to my collection.
B00000K0E5|5.0|I have no problem with Timothy Dalton's interpretation of Bond but in all fairness, it simply can't compare to Brosnan's. It's not a matter of who the best actor is, I simply believe Pierce Brosnan was born to play James Bond and he will be the thoughest one to substitute once he leaves the role.<BR>By the way, Goldeneye is pretty good. The pre-title sequence is one of the very best in a series with the most incredible ones.
B000065VB9|5.0|It must be difficult to realize that your previous work was with a band that played a significant role in the development of rock only to want more freedom in your music. Peter Gabriel's first two albums established he wasn't afraid to try new styles and in general have fun with music. Many of the songs from his first two albums are good but forgettable, however on number three he creates a masterepiece.<br />Building on growing themes of paranoia and a general darkness seldom put to uptempo or commercial music on this Peter Gabriel album, #3 but commonly referred to as \\"melting face\\" a new type of music is forged. <br />Amid a musical era where progressive rock was frowned upon by critics and radio Gabriel put out songs like Intruder, as creepy as any song gets with it's disimbodied and treated vocals along with what would be an 80's and still popular drum recording technique called gating, this makes the drum sound huge but cuts off (thus the word gate) the end part of the sound - very creative and still used 23 years later. <br />Beyond the treated vocals and sounds Intruder was simply creepy and once you got past that you were greeted with yet another take on self doubt, loathing and general ill ease.<br />Keep in mind this was revolutionary stuff for 1980 and led to recording techniques adopted by industrial and gothic artists along with progressive and punk acts. This album runs the full course of emotions ending with the rousing saga of Steven Biko, anti aparthid martyr and reason for one of rocks most common anthems coming into existance. Between the claustrophobic beginning and the soaring ending are punk/prog merges like And Through The Wire and Not One of Us along with the story of the making of a killer written in dramatic yet grounded style and performance.<br />This has always been Gabriel's forte and he uses it to incredible effect on this album. There is not a dull moment on this album and for people I was friends with at times it was almost too intense. No doubt part of the reason Atlantic dropped Gabriel refusing to release this album. <br />Fortunately Mercury did and PG saw some commercial success with FM hits Games Without Frontiers and Biko. And soon after this album's release you could hear the hoards of people trying to get the sound and feel found here. Except for Phil Collin's drum sound most of the imitations were pale in comparison. The thing to remember though is how groundbreaking this album was at the time of it's release. Finally PG put together the themes he wanted to write about with the kind of music he related to and wanted to experiment with.<br />This was absolutely stunning in 1980 is one of the few technologically based albums from that era to hold up well 22 years later.<br />This is an essential purchase.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I feel I should start by saying that I am NOT a Christina fan, nor am I too keen on the pop music scene. This review is written from the point of view of a music lover who loves all kinds of TRUE music. As i listened to this album, I realized something that with pop star albums you don't tend to see...artistic vision. Ms. Aguilera may receive flack as being a naked teen queen, but she does truly shine with this album. you get the sense that every song is actually not just a song, but a direct ventilation of a feeling. Not many pop stars can pull off a vision as this, and Ms. Aguilera apparently has learned well, to be compared to that of Janet Jackson's \\"Janet (1993)\\" album, that was a declaration of femininity and growth. It is not a ground breaking album, but rather an expression of what is inside this particular 21 year old woman's mind..not the vision of a producer/manager/record label or anyone else that tends to fabricate pop star albums. the vibe of this album seems melancholic but fierce..and it is rather difficult to point out certain tracks or also to point out songs that are disposable..every song is a thought, not a track. My personal favorite is a rather cheesy predictable pop confection called &quot;Infatuation&quot;, i simply find it interesting that the words &quot;i am full blood boricua!&quot; are coming out of this girl, but I am aware that the song is NOT talking about her, but rather are the words of her supposed man in that song. Another song that particularly amazed me was a song called &quot;Walk Away&quot;. if there was any doubt Ms. A. was a talented singer, this track shall definitely quell those sensations. She showcased such emotion, not ever seen before on a Christina track.<br />So in the end, all I can say is that this album is definitely worth picking up, If you can appreciate a woman's point of view and also particular and unapologetic vocalizations. She offers no apologies nor should she. Do what you will, Christina. My props to you.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is exactly what everyone has been hungry for. A deep sparkling colorful album. Whether your in the mood for some feminazi power chords to some jazzy soul to depressant pink floyd trips to feelin like doing some dirrty dancing. this album covers it all. \\"Impossible\\", alone is worth buying the record but the whole album is fun and and unmissable.
1586210661|4.0|It is often hard for authors to keep the reader focused when writing a book full of essays.  They can drag on, and may not interest the reader.  &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is just the opposite.  It is a very well written book of novels that I could not put down.  Sedaris possesses a unique writing style that will keep the reader reading for hours at a time and laughing out loud.  His peculiar life situations are what kept me focused, entertained, and amused.  David Sedaris has a laid-back writing style and a carefree way of living.  This showed me that life does not always have to be taken too seriously.  His nonchalant attitude is admirable.  I strongly recommend this book to mature readers that crave a good laugh.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man is probably the best comic strip film ever made!  It has the same feel as one of the old Super-Man episodes, but much more colorful, and better special effects.<br />The DVD is packed with features.  The biggest complaint I had with this edition is the theatrical ratio format of 1.85:1.  Most widescreen editions are released in 2.35:1 ratio, which separates it completely from the full-screen format.  <br />Another complaint I have is the casting.  Tobey Maguire is a very good actor indeed, but I felt that he was a bit too dorkie for this role.  Kirsten Dunst is good, but not a strong enough actress to star in a huge block-buster like this.<br />However, the action, special effects and fun will more than make up for the movie's pitfalls.  Go get it!
B00003CXCW|5.0|Who could have imagined that this film could get better but it has, now that it's on DVD.  Gloria's fans will revel in the ability to find just the right scene or dialogue at the touch of a button.  This is truly one of the best films of all time.  Just \\"sit dawnn\\" and watch it.  Reading Ms. Swanson's biography, \\"Swanson on Swanson\\" will give added depth to the screenplay because much of the detail in S.B. is, in fact, true.
B00004Z459|5.0|This was their first ever CD and it is the best CD anybody can own. If you don't have it, how stupid are you? The lead singer (Chester Bennington) is from Phoenix, my home town. This is the only Cd worth listening to everyday of your life.
B000002LND|5.0|No other pop singer of this era has remained as creative and highly origanal as Madonna. She has proved to be the definitive female artist, defining new styles and setting trends for her younger contemporaries. Her unparalled acheivements began with the recordings on this appropriatley named set (even though its missing other gems such as Dress You Up, Gambler and True Blue). The track listing, personally selected by Madonna is flawless. Each recording holds its own special and unique quality. Never has pop music sounded so well-crafted, infectious and sparse. She may have moved on from these kinds of tunes but they still stand just as well as they always did. The glorious musical arrangemenst, assembled by some of the best in the business are firmly complimented by Madonna's rich, breathy and seamless vocal approach. It was quit clear that even with a standard pop cut like Holiday that Madonna displayed a deep, raw talent and was clearly a gifted songwriter. Lucky Star has a catchy, electro-pop feel to it whilst Madonna displayed her flair for versatility on the breathtaking ballad Borderline. One of her most famous and popular hits of this era was Like A Virgin, which was produced by hot R&amp;B master, Nile Rogers who had also enjoyed success with soul music legend, Diana Ross. The upbeat  tunes are all vibrant blends of Dance/pop and even an injection of R&amp;B is coated on some tracks. From Into The Groove, to Material Girl to the magic of Open Your Heart, the formular never once wore thin and Madonna found herself in a style of her own and streets ahead of any artist her age. The meaty ballads, delivered with gutsy enthusiam are timeless. The atmospheric Live To Tell ranks as one of her very best recordings of this era whilst Papa Don't Preach sees Madonna exploring social issues of a young girl who is forced to tell her father that she is pregnant. The classical opening on this track is masterful and Madonna delivers this with style and a vengenace which iswhat makes her work so remarkably compelling as you know she is delivering a true, straight-from-the-heart performance. The exotic La Isla Bonita is another outstanding, pop masepiece whilst the religious undertones of Like A Prayer is one of the finest of her career to date and saw Madonna developing and maturing as an artist. Vogue is a hip, early 90's dance tune thats instantly infectious whilst the provactive, sultry Justify My Love is almost hypnotic with its atmospheric, trance-like arrangements. The set neatly rounds off with a fantastically composed pop number, Rescue Me which display her ever-growing vocal abilities. All of these recordings are landmarks in her career - Holiday, Lucky Star, Borderline, Like A Virgin, Material Girl, Crazy For you, Into The Groove, Live To Tell, Papa Don't Preach, Open Your Heart, La Isla Bonita, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself, Cherish, Vogue, Justify My Love &amp; Rescue Me - and all are outstanding masterpiece's that each posess an undeniably unique timeless quality. Not one dud track here and that is something exceptional! A classic collection from one of today's most enduring talents.
B000003TA4|5.0|There is absolutely no words to describe this album.  It changed the face of music.  If you don't own it, buy it.  If you own it, play it.  If you play it, listen to it.  You will hear the soul of Kurt Cobain come to life.
B00004S8X5|2.0|The debut album of the Australian pop legend is easily her most forgetable. Lacking a flair for versatility and blatantly a mere product of Stock-Aikten &amp; Waterman's conveyor-belt, hit-making assembly line, the album offers nothing new and sounds like this could be any pop artist recording in a studio in the late 1980's. Yet there is still something distinct about Kylie's vocal performances even though they're at their most squeaky and nasal at this point. Don't get me wrong, when I first bought this album in 1988 at the tender age of 8, i played it over and over again until my vinyl copy virtually was worn out but listening to this today, many years later it sounds terribly dated and so obviously a manufactured product of its day. On saying tha there is still something infectious about a few of the albums offerings. Je Ne Sais Pas Pour Qour, contains a sparse production with a sensual performance from its star whilst standing out from the rest of the album is the passionate Turn it Into Love. Theres a gentle reggae twinge to the surprisingly compelling I'll Still Be Loving You and a funky groove to Look My Way but other than that the album is light-weight, throw-away pop that hasn't stood the test of tim comfortably. Still, listening to tracks like I Should Be So Lucky, Got To Be Certain and I Miss You all manage to raise a smile as they remind you of a time of blissful youthfulness so in that respect the album is recommended to people who bought it the first time round as its an enjoyable album to wallow in nostalgia (if nothing else).  <BR>One thing this album does make you realise is that Kylie has come a long, long way from those squeaky-clean, disposable pop days and now reigns as one of the great pop divas of this era.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I would just like to follow up on the reviews that are complaining about what was included and what wasn't.  If you read the inside of the album, you will understand these songs are important songs in the career of Nirvana.  I look at the album as a tribute to Kurt Cobain.  It's a great collection showing the variety and intensity of style in their music.  Buy it.  It's great!
B000002VCQ|5.0|Whitney's self-titled debut album was but a taste of what was to come. Houstons explosive, soulful vocals come close to capturing the essence and depth of Aretha Franklin. The album is a perfect vehicle for a debut containing a striking mixture of soul/pop ballads and some more upbeat tunes that is every bit as much dance as they are soul. What the album captures is her sensuality such as on the albums debut single (which bombed) You Give Good Love where Whitney's vocals are crystal clear, expressive and soulful. The sheer volume and power of her vocal chords are displayed on the powerful, tear-jerking ballads such as the timeless Saving All My Love For You, Greatest Love Of All and All At Once. Her first major hit, How Will I Know steers more into commercial pop as does the electro-funk sounds of Thinking About You and the infectious Someone For Me. All contain compelling musical arrangements that are complimented by firm, concentrated performances from its star. The duets also work well with the exotic Take Good Care Of My Heart and Nobody Loves Me Like You Do (both with Jermaine Jackson) and Hold Me with soul singer Teddy Pendergrass. <BR>All in all a solid album that was multiply produced by Michael Masser (famous for his work with Diana Ross in the 1970's on such classics like Touch Me In The Morning and Theme From Mahogany), Jermaine Jackson and Kashiff and featuring diverse musical arrangements from Narada Michael walden. Whitneys voice is superb and on top form throughout. Consistently excellent, the Whitney Houston album is a must have!
B00006IUL7|4.0|I'm not even going to speend alot of time on tis review. It's good trust me. I mean Al Paino, Robin Williams, Hilary Swank, Nicky Katt (WAY OF THE GUN) and Jonathan Jackson (TUCK EVERLASTING)are in it. Like I said, trust me. Oh yeah, it's from Christopher Nolan, the director of MEMENTO. It's good. Buy it, now!
B0000025RI|5.0|An outstanding masterpiece and contains Micheal Jacksons very best and most creative work. At this time when he recorded the album he was unbeatable! His stage performances were astounding and his work was streets ahead from any of his contemporaries. Produced entirley by the genius Quincy Jones and aided by Michael himself, this collection features 9 immaculate and totally infectious recordings. The hot, repetitive pulse on Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' sounded like an ideal choice for release as a single though it remained locked away on this album. His touching duet with ex-Beatle Paul McCartney is delivered with a strong, passionate vocal approach whilst the glorious, sensual R&B coated sounds of Human Nature is another fabulous cut. But outstanding are two of the biggest hits off the album - Billie Jean and Beat It. Creative, versatile musical arrangements define these two distinguished classics. Featuring a roaring, thrashing guirtar throughout, Beat It features Michael giving a jamming performance. The whole thing comes out sounding perfect as does the more sensual, sexually charged Billie Jean, which became a monster No.1 smash hit and became one of the best sellers of his career. Surprisingly the eerie Thriller has not quite stood the test of time as well as the rest of the albums recordings, sounding distinctley dated to its era but there is still something infectious about it with its catchy groove and hooky chrous. The rest of the album is standard fare which stand well with sensational recordings Baby Be Mine, P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing) and the gorgeous, The Lady In My Life.<br />Micheal Jacksons straight-from-the-heart approach to his music was phenomenal. Highly origanal, in-touch lyrics and razor-sharp musical arrangements were just some of his ingredients to his unparalled success. Sparse and infectious and one of the biggest selling albums in history, Thriller is an unforgetable masterpiece that is essential in any serious record collection!
B00006LWSF|2.0|When I saw the artists touted on the album cover, I thought the album would be promising.  But except for the 1st song, \\"Lose Yourself,\\" the rest of the album is pretty weak.  I was even disappointed with some of my favorite artists, NAS and Gang Starr.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Since i was a kid, ive been waiting for Spiderman to come to the big screen.  I thought it was impossible, the web slinging, the dangling above crouded streets, the costume is even a difficult one.  Bottom Line: Nobody has pulled off a comic strip movie that followed the story line as closely, and captured the characters like Spiderman.  Great Effects, Great Costume Design, Great Body on Kristen Dunst... i loved it.
B000002JNJ|4.0|This cd is by far there best.....even tho some of the songs in this cd kinda show that they were stuggling and later proved it in vulger. The opening is  a bad song one of my fav, cowboys from helllllll nice song. Another good song s cemetery gates, my fav on the cd .Overall its a good cd to play when ur pounding some cheap beer, but it  has nothing on a greater band such as metallica... now thats a good band.
B000063V8R|5.0|I wasn't into Star Trek TNG when it was on TV, so I wasn't sure what I was getting into when I purchased this season on DVD (and seasons 1,2 & 4 at roughly the same time).  In my opinion, Season 3 is the best as between seasons 1-4.  The episodes are consistently excellent and several of them are simply outstanding.  Yesterday's Enterprise and The Price are alone worth the cost of this collection.<br />The audio and video quality of the DVD is movie quality.  This is a fabulous entertainment value for anyone interested in Star Trek in my opinion. Frankly, the episodes are far better than the original series, and the DVDs are far less expensive. All of seasons 1-4 are worth owning in my opinion, but the 3d is the best as between these.  (I am presently waiting for seasons 5-7 to be released, so I have no comparison to offer there).
B000002JR8|1.0|....I thought they were struggling on vulger but damn they shoulda stopped why they were ahead, doesnt even sound like metal to me... just some dweeb screaming trying to look cool. If u like good music dont buy this.
0804102988|4.0|This book is a rough read, but it is well worth the effort.  The novel begins in prehistoric, ice age England and continues through the present day, as seen through the eyes of a number of English bloodlines.  An ambitious project such as this is bound to have flaws, and this is not a perfect book.  But it is an outstanding book, and truly gives the reader a \\"feel\\" for England and its history.<br />Some parts of the book are easy reads, and some aren't.  The best parts are the parts dealing with stone age England, the Black Death era, Roman era England, and the times around the American Revolution.  Some of the intervals in between the foregoing get pretty bogged down, and are tough sledding.  But this is a book that is worth reading, worth finishing, and worth reading again.<br />Oddly, the book largely ignores the Napoleonic War era, one of Britain's most heroic times.  It also does not dwell much on the British Empire at its height.  It spends more time on histories of old English cathedrals than most of us care about.  But what the heck, with a subject as ambitious as this one, criticism is inevitable.<br />This book will not disappoint, but it does require effort.
B000062U7B|5.0|Iron Maiden has always been strong in the studio; but live is their forte. Even though they have released live material via A REAL LIVE/DEAD ONE many agree that they never captured the immortal performance of Live After Death. Well Rock in Rio nails it. With 3 guitars and a power not seen since Maiden's glory days, this album will prove that Maiden are back on top. You can spring for the DVD and see it unfold; but the live album is a great compliment. It's crisp, clear and has probably the best live engineering that you can get. New to Maiden makes a great compilation; Maiden fan and you haven't gotten it yet what are you waiting for. I caught the BNW show in Ohio and this is exactly what I heard, same set. So if you have never caught Maiden live this will help until the next tour comes along. Try and find this album with the rare LITHOGRAPH it's a Maiden treasure. Both the CD/DVD are great for your collection. UP THE IRONS.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band Of Brothers is excellent.  Well acted, well directed, super script, this is a mini-series that should be shown in History classes aroudn the USA.  Follows the book by Stephen Ambrose very closely!  Top notch acting and super battle scenes help this 10-hour mini-series flowing.  You won't think it was 10-hours long and when it is over, you'll wish it was longer!
B00006NSZ5|5.0|This is an awsome soundrack. One of the best around.It features Eminems  new single \\"Lose Yourself\\".If you are a rap listener GET THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000068PQ0|2.0|I was expecting a great and innovative CD (also thanks to the usual enthusiastic reviews on amazon, which I'll learn not to read anymore!)but I was sadly disappointed. I agree with one reviewer before me who said that the first song is \\"Father and Son\\" by Cat Stevens without the credits, the rest is a band that tries to make something new but really does not manage to! All in all it's not a bad record, just useless. A mix between some electronic music, plus some 70s rock whithout much musical inspiration. Not to mention the lyrics, a 5 years old kid could probably write better stuff. If you write stupid lyrics it does not necessarily mean you're so smart and unconventional, sometimes you just look like a stupid!
B00005R87Q|4.0|The words &quot;speed, strength and danger&quot; are the ones which characterise this movie!!  It is fast, illegal and makes adrenaline reach its peak... A movie that should not be missing from a car fan. The fact that they gathered so many people to take part in the movie because of their tuned-up cars is something that makes it even more interesting for a car fan and even more tempting for someone to see what the special effects in collaboration with the &quot;tough guys&quot; can do... A very good movie undoubtedly!!
0385474547|1.0|I'm not much of a reader but I know a good book when I read one. Sorry Achebe but this one was well...BLAN! Didn't keep my interest at all. I read it for school and only becuz i had to. THe story never really picked up and got me interested. I didn't much care for Okonkwo either. What right does he have to boss his wives around and beat them. Of course the women didn't know better. Eh...still one star. Maybe even half a star.
0792164903|5.0|This is the most magnificent horror movie I have ever seen and one of favorite movies of all time.  One of the main motivations for my buying a DVD player a couple of years ago was the desire to own Sleepy Hollow in the ultimate format.  Normally I have nothing but disdain for a film that completely rewrites a classic tale such as The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, but I have no complaints at all about this masterpiece.  The movie does take so many liberties with the original that Washington Irving might have a hard time recognizing it, though.  Ichabod Crane is not a mild-mannered schoolteacher but is instead an enterprising New York City constable whose determination to use scientific method in his work earns him the unpalatable assignment of investigating a series of beheadings in the hamlet of Sleep Hollow.  He regards the tale told by the town elders about a headless horseman as nonsense-until he sees the horseman at work with his own two eyes.  His timid nature rather obviously revealed, he nevertheless steadfastly continues his investigation of the matter, concentrating on a conspiracy linking the different murders.  The increasingly supernatural aspects of the story do nothing to take away from a spectacular ending.<br />Sleepy Hollow boasts a spectacular cast and a stellar crew of filmmakers.  Tim Burton, with a little help from Francis Ford Coppola, has created a work of art.  The settings are incredible and truly evocative of a farming community of the late 18th century.  The dark and moody atmosphere of Sleepy Hollow makes the very town an important character in and of itself.  When we view the scenes of Crane's childhood memories, full of vibrant color seemingly leaping off the screen, the contrast between the two atmospheres is incredible.  No actor is more at home in a Gothic setting than Johnny Depp, and he truly shines in Sleepy Hollow, giving Crane a depth of character that is crucial to the film's success.  He has to conquer his own fears, subdue the memories of his childhood, and deal with the conflicting emotions he has toward Katrina van Tassel in order to bring the beheadings to an end.  Christina Ricci is utterly charming and enchantingly beautiful as Katrina; I could watch this movie endlessly just to see her performance.  Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gambon, and Michael Gough bring great talent to the film as the town leaders, and Martin Landau contributes another distinguished head to the proceedings.  Then there is Christopher Walken, who was the perfect choice to play the role of the Hessian soldier/Headless Horseman-he has no lines, but his presence broods over the whole film.<br />There are some tender and comical moments in the film, but one is frequently reminded of the horror aspect by the continuing series of beheadings.  I lost count of just how many there were.  I must say that these are some of the best, most impressive beheadings I have been witness to.  Burton even adds special touches such as one scene in which the head spins around quickly before leaving the shoulders of its suddenly former body.  The representation of the headless horseman is also quite exceptional and disturbingly realistic.  There is not an excessive amount of blood in the film, but those who find the sight of headless bodies disquieting will have much to squirm and squeal about.<br />The plot holds together very well, each subtle clue or incident ultimately falling into place; there is no extraneous material added to pad the film or slow it down in any way.  The music complements every bit of the action very well, and the beautifully realistic mood that only Tim Burton could have created is guaranteed to draw you completely into the story.  I really cannot praise this movie enough; it is horror crafted into an art form by the deft hands of Tim Burton.mories of his childhood, and deal with the conflicting emotions he has toward Katrina van Tassel in order to bring the beheadings to an end.

0780020685|5.0|Having remembered seeing the movie in Japan in widescreen format, I was mortified to find that that option was not available to me in this edition...Then I heard that the movie was never actually IN widescreen format to begin with ...oops...Don't know WHY I had some hallucination that I'd seen it letterboxed...Anyway, every human being should see The Seven Samurai and if you haven't, what are you waiting for?  This and Yojimbo are two of Kurosawa's most crowd-pleasing entries...
0792843584|1.0|To write a review, you have to give it a star and this doesn't deserve any.  I have just read a few of the most recent reviews for Heaven's Gate have to give a rebuttal.  I am made to wonder if the positive reviews are from the grandchildren of original investors hoping to recoup the family fortune through new video sales.  I would rather watch \\"Ernest Goes To Camp\\" every day for a month than see Heaven's Gate again.  I rented this when it was first out on video.  Watching this movie was excruciating.  I could not view it in one sitting.  The only reason I watched the whole thing was to look for one redeeming feature and I never found it. The sound was trash and the filming technique was unbelievably poor.  I can't believe it was ever shown to the public.
B000002BQK|3.0|Sorry, Mariah, but the \\"same ole', same ole'\\" was not working here. Yeah, there are a few good tracks (the title cut, \\"Fourth of July\\", \\"Babydoll\\") here, but the bulk of the album is so similar to \\"Daydream\\" that if you have one, you have the other.<br /><br />The standout is the Prince-penned \\"The Beautiful Ones\\". With Dru Hill's assistance, Mariah's whispery vocals add just the right touch to the music of \\"the purple one.\\"<br /><br />It's too bad the rest of the album doesn't \\"fly\\" like this tune.
B0000683DH|5.0|The dvd is packed with great material.  The old interviews of the stars are great.  The movie itself is in my opinion the best Star Trek flick. It is a good continuation of the series.  Extenede directors edition does not have much movie film. Overall a must have and joins The Motion Picture as a classic.  Cannot wait to see the new edition of Search for Spock
B0000542D1|5.0|I first watched this movie (with my father and sister) more than 20 years ago, I was a kid. Then film is reissued and I got it. I have the VHS version (believe it or not I'm still playing VHS!!!)of this re-release and it looks great, sound quality is great (much better than McCartney's Get back concert) and images are perfect, I have no home theater and picture looks and sounds great in my Sony Wega TV set. <BR> Song mixes are different from the ones in the soundtrack CD but they're good also.<BR> OK, they're not actors, but, Who cares?, they look good playing to be themselves, <BR> A must for every Beatles fan!!!<br />PS.- Now my kids (actually two of them, the third is too young at 11 months old) are enjoying this picture after years of its original release!!!!<br />Regards.
0312958455|3.0|This is a good Bosch book, but not a great one.  Their is too much exploration of Bosch's personal life.  To long and not enough story. Would not be a good book to start on Connelly.  Try Blood Work or Concrete Blond.
0790738074|5.0|I am a big fan of The Music Man.  I own both soundtracks the one to the broadway production and the one to the movie.  Although I don't own the movie yet, I have rented it several times, and never wanted to take it back.<br />When I was a kid I used to love the songs from the show.  I saw it on stage twice.  And I have always wanted the part of Harold Hill.  I'd have to say my favorite song from the show is &quot;The Sadder But Wiser Girl For Me,&quot; which I used to think was &quot;The Sadder Budweiser Girl,&quot;<br />The cast in the movie consists of Robert Preston as Harold Hill (reprising his stage role) Shirley Jones as Marion Paroo, Hermione Gingold as Eulalie McKecknie Shinn, Paul Ford as Mayor Shinn, Pert Kelton as Mrs. Paroo (reprising her stage role) and I really liked Ronnie Howard from the Andy Griffith show cast as Opie.<br />For those of you who don't know, Shirley Jones was pregnant when she played the part of Marion.  She sure didn't look it though.  She did a great job.  I hope this show keeps playing on both stage and screen.
0345350499|5.0|This book is, and I am sure, will remain in the Top Five books I have ever read, and I read a lot.  You can really fall into the story, lose yourself in plots and mystery, inside of all the characters.  I have read it more than once, more than twice... I find myself reading it at least once a year.  It can really take you away from the mundane world for a while.  It is thought provoking, and sometimes, it's even shocking.  Most of all, it is a GOOD read... no, a GREAT read.
B000002542|5.0|Without breaking down the album by song or with too much intricacy, let me just say that after over 30 years of listening to rock n roll, the first Journey album remains near the top of my list of all time favorites. I've always loved great lead guitar and good jams. The first three albums put out by Journey, prior to Steve Perry joining the band, have got to be some of the greatest guitar playing and overall jamming you will ever hear on a rock record. The music is built around the jam. While more than half of the songs include vocals, almost every song ends in a jam. And while this may sound repetitive and simplistic, the music is all creative and top notch. For those who enjoy classic guitar jam songs like Free Bird or Green Grass and High Tides, you will also enjoy early Journey albums, especially the first Journey (1975). I feel that Neal Schon, while recognized as a well established guitarist from his work with later Journey albums, is just out of his mind on the first three pre Steve Perry albums. While technically a brilliant guitarist, what really sets Neal Schon apart is the mellodic creativity in his solos. His leads often are structured in a step by step manner, building to a climactic finale. For just a taste, I recommend listening to the opening song, Of a Lifetime. Incredible stuff. I must add, that while I consider the first album titled Journey to be my favorite of the initial three albums, I do consider the guitar work on the song Look Into the Future, off their second album, to be the absolute pinnacle of Neal Schon's guitar playing.
B00000JCB2|5.0|OK alot of people say Limp is just a bunch of [stuff], but then u look at the figures and u gotta realize alot of people saying this have to b hypocrites cos whenver a Limp album comes out there is ALOT of sells going on. Anyway about the CD itself its a essential rap-rock Cd of the finest quality. ...Anyways I highly reccomend this record!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I MUST SAY THE THIS IS NOT MY STYLE OF MUSIC.  MY TASTE IS MORE ALONG THE LINES OF MADONNA, CHER, RICKY MARTIN YA KNOW DANCE.  WELL AFTER HEARING &quot;YOUR BODY IS A WONDERLAND&quot; 100 TIMES ON THE RADIO I SAID &quot;OK, I'LL TAKE A RISK&quot;  AND BOUGHT THE CD.  I FELL IN LOVE!  THIS MAN HAS GOT TALENT.  ALL THE TRACKS ON THE CD ARE GREAT BUT &quot;GREAT INDOORS&quot; IS ONE OF THE BEST.  IT HAS A GREAT HOOK THAT YOU JUST CAN'T GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD.  &quot;LOVE SONG FOR NO ONE&quot; IS A GREAT DRIVE SONG.  YOU WILL HAVE YOUR OWN LITTLE CONCERT IN YOUR CAR.  WELL ANYWAYS YOU HAVE TO GET THIS CD, IT IS A MUST HAVE!!  TRUST ME!
B000002KBU|5.0|There is little to criticize on Joni Mitchell's brilliant album. (Oh, perhaps that \\"My Old Man\\" is about 40 seconds too long?)  It is an almost perfect package. From the free-flying rhythms of \\"Carey\\" to the intimacy of  \\"Little Green,\\" Mitchell's emotional and vocal range is unsurpassed.  The opener, \\"All I Want,\\" immediately hints at her jazz sensibilities. Her fluid voice paints pictures, dipping and soaring through emotional draft winds.<br />Joni sounds like she singing directly to you. She seems unafraid of where her voice will take her, and vocal and musical risk-taking (listen to the very brief Rolling Stones-like riff on \\"This Flight Tonight\\") are incredibly rewarding.  The dominant themes are longing (\\"Little Green, \\" \\"River\\"), love lost and found (\\"A Case of You,\\" \\"All I Want\\") disillusionment (\\"The Last Time I Saw Richard\\") and hope (\\"California\\").<br />This 1971 effort is one of the finest vocal albums ever made.  The restrained accompaniment is superb, with guitars by Stephen Stills, James Taylor, and Sneeky Pete, and drums by Russ Kunkel. By the way, let's make \\"California\\" the official state song.) Highly recommended, very deserving of its reputation, you simply must hear this one.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Throughout the extras on the DVD for \\"Spider-Man\\" runs a subtext that the fan base -- that notoriously cranky demographic of male comic readers -- had to be accommodated, not antagonized. The filmmakers must have become pretty good at wrangling this dynamic. The extras on the swinging new \\"Spider-Man\\" DVD -- pointedly segregated at one point into sections for the comic and the movie -- should appeal both to Spidey fans and serious film folk alike. The two-disc set is packed with extras that are well-organized and, for the most part, worth the effort to wade through.<br />The movie looks fine, especially considering all the disc space devoted to extras. The DVD faithfully renders the feature's surprisingly restrained color scheme of rich reds (Spider-Man), algae greens (the Goblin) and golds (the ambers of the dawn sun hitting Manhattan). Images range from OK (the Parker household set) to spectacular (the shining scenes over Gotham). The amazing look of the trailers collection hints at the potential for a reference-quality DVD.<br />Audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 only. The fun takes a while to get started, but the soundstage soon enough does a home invasion on the viewing room. Rear effects consistently keep listeners on edge, delivering a few solid jolts (the Green Goblin's flashback, for instance).<br />Director Sam Raimi and co-producer Grant Curtis provide entertaining commentary, their talk paired with a separate session by producer Laura Ziskin and star Kirsten Dunst.<br />Many producers waste their DVD commentary time playing straight men to creative talent; Ziskin offers a rare perspective on what it's like to be a working producer, playing the budget game for time and money.<br />Dunst says her Mary Jane character probably hasn't figured out that Parker is the web crawler: \\"She isn't that smart.\\" The actress' famous wet-shirt scene passes without comment, but she reveals that she shot a solo bedroom dance in her underwear that was cut (\\"It was a little too much\\").<br />Raimi's a DVD commentary veteran, always upbeat, offbeat and informative. He spends a lot of time crediting co-workers like the second unit directors, giving the scope of just how intensely collaborative modern action films are.<br />The film has two huge effects scenes -- the Times Square clash between Spidey and the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and the concluding sequence of our hero swinging through Manhattan. Both are covered in detail on an interesting separate commentary track from effects designer John Dykstra and digital co-conspirators Anthony LaMolinara and Scott Stokdyk.\\"). <br />Raimi's a DVD commentary veteran, always upbeat, offbeat and informative.

B00005JKDR|3.0|You have to sit through 20 minutes of previews everytime you want to watch it.  I'm wearing out the skip button because I apparently need to know whats comming in the fall of 2002.  I'm guessing this is information I won't need to know in a month or so....   It's really annoying.
B00005JK8K|1.0|This movie hyped itself to feature the efforts of the Navajo indians during WWII and the usage of their language as code.  Less than 10% of this movie is actually about the Navajo indians' contribution to the Pacific War effort and mostly about the Nicolas Cage character and his problems.  I was very disappointed.
0316096199|5.0|This is the story of a women who was beaten down by life.  It is also a story of a women who got up, brushed herself off, and kicked some major butt.  Not in the physical action movie sense, but in the true to life sense of facing evil and overcoming.  I believe true empathic writing springs from pain.  And this women knows pain.  [...].
B00006CXSS|5.0|I am buying this DVD set so that I will have this movie to show to my grandkids, because it is what I want them to know about World War II. Watching this movie is the closest thing to listening to stories from veterans that I have found. It is real, it is gut-wrenching, and it is AMAZING. The acting is wonderful too. There weren't enough stars listed above for the rating I would like to give this movie.

B00005JL2O|5.0|Fantastic, hilarious... if you liked the first two you will cry your heart out laughing while watching Goldmember.  Highly recommended!
B00005LQ04|5.0|This film isn't for everyone. The only bad part about this movie is the dubbing. This is one that you actually have to sit down and watch, not one that jumps out and goes boo then you get over it, no this is one that digs deep and won't let go with it's unrelenting fury. It is really good. Yes it's an old one, but the new horro films don't even meet this standard, except maybe The Ring. See this, if you want to get scared. Watch it by yourself with the lights off!
B00006G8HX|4.0|When it was first released in 1984, \\"The Search For Spock\\" was hailed as the best of the Star Trek movies to date--there was no \\"odds are bad, evens are good\\" rule, and instead it seemed like each new film was going to outstrip the last.  However, with the passage of years and the development of the \\"odds/evens\\"<BR>rule (no doubt helped by the release of V, \\"Generations\\" and \\"Insurrection\\"), \\"The Search For Spock\\" was retroactively downgraded as an iffy venture, with some good points but also a fair number of items that could be improved.  Fans now complain about the ripping off of the \\"Star Wars\\" bar scene, Robin Curtis' portrayal of Saavik, the wimpiness and annoying nature of all the other Starfleet captains, and the contrivances surrounding the destruction of the Enterprise (all that to take out six lousy Klingons?  Kirk had defeated much greater odds before). <br />However, whatever weak points the film may have, the strong points far outweigh them.  \\"Star Trek III\\" was a successful combination of the big ideas and emotional complexities of the first film and the tight paced action of the second, wrapped around a compelling story.  There are delightful references to TOS lore scattered throughout (tribbles, the self-destruct code, Rand's cameo, Sarek's spectacular reappearance and the scenes on Vulcan), and each of the supporting cast get their own special moment, far more than they had in either of the first two films.<BR>The film's humor looks forward to \\"Star Trek IV\\" and Nimoy has a lightness in his directorial touch that feels like the soul of the series has returned.  However, it is the angle on the Kirk/Spock/McCoy triad which makes this film so special.  McCoy's performance as the tortured McCoy is top-notch, and that Kirk would sacrifice everything to save his best friends provides for character development and some truly epic themes (a twist on the \\"needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few\\" line from Star Trek II). The destruction of the Enterprise may be contrived, as is Spock's convenient adult age when dragged off of the Genesis planet, but in a sense these \\"contrivances\\" seem necessary to emphasize the lengths Kirk was forced to go this time, and the mystical nature of the plot.  The scenes on Genesis and on Vulcan are incredibly beautiful; the DVD brings out the picture and sound in these scenes immeasurably.  <br />The Special Edition does not change anything in the original movie (no director's cut or deleted scenes), but the special features on disc two are adequate, including a trailor for the new ST film \\"Nemesis\\" and a great \\"Captain's Log\\" documentary on the making of the film, with Shatner providing choice interview moments.  OK, so no-one (sans die-hard fanatics) really cares about learning Klingon, but I feel satisfied with what I have.  \\"The Search For Spock\\" does not need to be improved by new edits, SFX or added scenes; its only weak points (such as the out-of-character Starfleet captains) are faults from the original script.
0671798154|5.0|This book is exciting, gripping, suspenseful - and fun.  I've read it over and over, and shared it with my friends.  It's a thriller in every sense.  Thayer really knows his material, and is one of those rare authors who is truly gifted at his work.  This will always be one of my favorites.
B00006AUIG|3.0|Truly, what is it about abandoned institutions that is so compelling? Is it their size? Is it all the pain and unhappiness that grew like cancer inside of their walls? Is it the mystery in their vast space and dark corridors of things we can only speculate that draws us in? <BR>This movie totally plays on that premise.And if you identify at all with what I am saying,this movie is for you.<br />But keep a light on......just in case.
6304167660|4.0|Awesome dialogues between all characters. Dialogues between Hutton and Portman were catchy and captured my attention at first. Dialgoues between Uma Thurman and the male characters were smart and witty. Michael Rappaport's description of beautiful girls and models were saids all about this movie. The title and description of the movie may seem like a 'chick-flick' but by no means it is one. A 20 something to early 30 guy could definitely relate to all the characters. A highly recommended flick for movie lovers who enjoy good acting, nice dialogues and real life drama with a flare of humour!

B00005221M|1.0|Throughout my consumer-driven life, I have, on occasion, felt prompted to write a negative review of something I purchased.  I have not, however, EVER gone through with it, until now.  This wretched rendition of such a wonderful film deserves all the cursing I can muster.  The cretins at FOX deserve a form of punishment from Dante's \\"INFERNO\\" for mutating Micheal Mann's picture for this DVD.  For a moment let me put aside all pretense of eloquence and say..ahem...<br />...Now that I have stated my opinion, allow me to tell you why.  <br />First of all, there are no special features.  And I mean NO special features.  Zip, zero, nada, nothing, zilch.  I don't mean to belittle the marvel of \\"Digital quality picture and sound\\", but for those of us, like myself, that have a POS television and sound system, special features are the primary attraction of DVDs.  The best \\"extra\\" on this disc is the ability to put the sub-titles in spanish (it doesn't even come with a \\"dubbing\\" option); interviews, cut scenes, commentaries, biographies do not exist on this DVD.<br />Secondly, this \\"Anamorphic Widescreen\\" is a complete rip off.  The natural subtitles that come with the feature (ie - when someone is speaking french or an Indian language) often get cut off at the sides of the screen.  Scenes that warrant \\"Widescreen\\" are wide enough to tease you, but not wide enough to really get the scope of this breath-taking picture.<br />Also, the \\"Director's Expanded Edition\\" is not exactly as it was on VHS.  I confess that I never saw the original theatrical release (I was 11 in 1992 and my parents were not in the habit of taking me to \\"R\\" rated pictures) and that my only exposure to \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" is the \\"Director's Cut\\" VHS edition.  While I noticed no significant changes in scene or sequence, a few of my favorite lines were unceremoniously cut.  And I cannot fathom why.  They could not have contributed more than 3 minutes to the length of the movie, but they contributed soVERY much to the character development.  I was utterly disappointed.<br />Finally, just let me say that this DVD is a waste of your money.  There is NO reason to purchase this film on DVD (when this is the DVD to purchase).  Buy the widescreen VHS version, trust me, you'll respect yourself in the morning. ...<br />...Just My Opinion,<BR>K. KELLEY
B000066744|5.0|A mother gave birth to a baby on a ship crossing the Atlantic.  She left him atop a piano to be found.  The crew member who found him named him 1900 since he was found on the first day of the first month of 1900.  1900 lives his whole life aboard the ship on which he was born.  The Legend of 1900 is the story of his life aboard the ship.  This movie is magical.  It is enrapturing and has an amazing ability to draw you in from the very beginning with it's magic.  1900 is a phenomenal piano player and the movie comes alive with his music.  Only once is 1900 tempted to leave the ship to visit a beautiful young girl who inspired the most beautiful song of the movie.  This movie is an experience, not just a movie.  You inhale this movie rather than watch it!
6302765536|5.0|Essentially a big-budgeted remake of the first &quot;Home Alone,&quot; &quot;Home Alone 2&quot; is an even better sequel that far surpasses the likes of &quot;Home Alone&quot; and the bland &quot;Home Alone 3.&quot;<br />Kevin McAllister (Macaulay Culkin) ends up getting stranded in New York, while his parents and family ends up in Paris. All alone in the Big Apple, Kevin uses a borrowed credit card and tricks the suspicious conoisseur (Tim Curry) into giving him the best suite they have, while avoiding the same crooks that he nabbed in the first film (Daniel Stern, Joe Pesci) who want revenge. On his way to meet back with his family, Kevin befriends a toy shop owner and a stoic old woman dubbed the 'Bird Lady', who eventually help him reach his family safely.<br />&quot;Home Alone 2&quot; hits home with it's clever physical and sight gags, which some is disturbingly violent, but it compensates for it almost immediately with downright hilarious reactions and a big heart of gold.<br />This is essentially, a cozy, warmhearted holiday film with plenty of hilarity and heart to spare. Its freshness is an added bonus, for it can be enjoyed on days other besides the Christmas holiday. Highly recommended--a family classic.<br />Rated PG for cartoonish violence, crude/comic humor and mild language.
B00004YB9Y|2.0|When I first got this CD two years ago, I listened to it as I drove everywhere during the holiday season.  A Three Tenors Christmas CD had been long awaited and I, an avid fan, could not be without it.  However, as I have gotten it out in following years, it has been harder and harder for me to enjoy.  <br />Every piece on the CD, whether in French, English, German-- whatever, has many diction problems.  Besides that, the ensemble is a disaster; the orchestra and singers are often separated (as is the orchestra from itself and the singers from themselves).  It is undeniable that the tenors are past their primes; they cover all their vowels as soon as they get in their passaggi.  Further, the music is all manipulated to end on high A's, Bb's, and even a few B's.  After a while, this kind of exclamation mark ending is wearing on the ears and nerves.  For those of you with perfect pitch, note that the orchestra and singers are constantly WAY out of tune.  <br />I would not recommend this CD to anyone for the aesthetic value, but only for Three Tenor fans who cannot live without it.  For holiday listening, turn more toward the classics we've heard since childhood, like those found on NOW Christmas.
B000024D4R|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the PINK FLOYD and I still don't understand why \\"Animals\\" is not considered as good as \\"Dark Side of the moon\\" or \\"the Wall\\".    <BR>\\"ANIMALS\\" is an amazing album !!! A MASTERPIECE !!! <BR>\\"Dogs\\" is, for me, the best song the Pink Floyd have ever played, Gilmour's solo is incredible !!! <BR>An absolute MUST HAVE !!!
B00006V9A0|5.0|As a huge fan of Nirvana, and personally owning some 60+ Nirvana CD's, I am really buying this for You Know You're Right (even though I have an MP3 version). For me, any Nirvana is good Nirvana.<br />I am giving this CD 5 stars because of the music, and not necessarily the selections. Sure these are all great songs, but would it have hurt to maybe give us a double CD issue, with maybe 4 genres-- early, polished, raw and unheard.<br />I really hope that next year we can get a box set that is a difinitive issue. Having over 60 Nirvana CD's I probably have every studio track ever released, as well as many out-takes, demos and the like. As a fan, I would pay $200 for a special set, maybe a 10-12 set that would stand as \\"the\\" collection to own, including behind the scenes Nevermind and In Utero stuff.<br />I still hope...
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This movie is a bigger hit in my house than Toy Story!  If I allowed it, my son would watch this movie every night!<BR>When a watched the movie for the first time, I thought that the monsters would frighten my son.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I was fortunate enough to receive my pre-order early, so I thought I would share some thoughts on the actual DVDs. The series itself has more than enough reviews, but for those of you who are still undecided, I thought a review of the actual product might help.<br />The discs come in a nifty little tin box which has a gatefold inside which holds the DVDs. Overall a very sturdy and attractive container. The presentation itself is quite nice. The picture is clear and sharp, and seems to be a very good transfer. One nice surprise is the presence of a DTS audio track, which is kind of unique for a series which played exclusively on cable TV. It does not possess the same sort of audio perfection displayed in Saving Private Ryan, but nonetheless it is a very good audio experience, especially for a made-for-TV product. The biggest difference I can tell is a slightly diminished use of the back surround speakers, but still, it is quite good and has moments of superb acoustic ambience. As far as the DTS vs. the Dolby Digital track, the DTS is noticeably clearer with the spoken dialog, and just generally sounds better.<br />The discs also have a field guide feature for each episode. It displays, among other things, a list of the soldiers you will see in that particular episode. This can be very useful when everyone starts to look alike after a while. I haven't seen the bonus disc yet, but it looks like it will be interesting as well.<br />Overall, I was very pleased with the entire set. It is a quality product with great video and sound, and will make a great addition to your DVD collection.
0380789035|1.0|This is the first book I've read by Gaiman, and I don't intend to read another. I found this book to be boring, implausible, and mind-numbingly stupid. First of all, the so-called 'gods' have no godlike powers. They are just a bunch of senile old people who sit around in their depends eating boiled cabbage and complaining that nobody cares about them. Well, you won't care about them either. The main character, Shadow, doesn't care about anything. Doesn't care whether he lives or dies, and wouldn't matter if he did because this is a fantasy story where people can die and come back to life whenever it's convienient. Gaiman isn't American, and he doesn't know jack about America. Maybe he drove through Florida once and never left the highway except to stop for gas and cigarettes. He seems oblivious to the fact that this is a country that believes in God with a capital 'G', something that never comes up in this lame story.<br />  In a world where three headed gorgons ride flaming monkeys, I guess anything could happen. Not much does in this overblown heap of dung. 500 pages of sitting around, having dinner with your grandparents waiting for the 'clash of the gods', just to have it end not with a bang, but with a whimper.<br />  I could go on and on, but I don't want to waste anymore of our time. Don't waste your time on this award-winning stinker like I did. Don't waste your time reading any more reviews. Go visit grandma, go make some cheese fondue, just don't read this book.<br />  American Gods gets one star, and that's only because it provided me with plenty of toilet paper.
B00003CXI1|5.0|This is a great movie and I love the special features on the DVD.  The deleted scenes were not easy to find, but they were worth the effort.  You find them on the special features disc in the classroom section and click on the symbol on the torch.  Going to classes was very interesting.  I don't know how many times I got blown up and ended up in the hospital wing in Potion's class!  The interviews with Chris Columbus and David Heyman were informative and gave you a view of the building of the sets.  I do wish that interviews with the cast had been included.<br />I was delighted that the movie followed so closely to the book.  There were a few scenes that were different (students sent to the Forbiden Forest, Norbert, Harry and Draco's meeting, etc.) but that did not detract from the movie.  Although I did have to go see it a second time to enjoy it fully and not compare it to the book.<br />This movie is the first in the series of Harry Potter and no fan should be without!
B000002OX7|5.0|Has to be the best rock album ever recorded. This is one of those albums that can never be repeated. Every song is unique and Townshend's writing was at its best. The Who had been touring incessantly with Tommy before they recorded this and you can hear how they had matured from the Shepherds Bush pop group into a superb rock band. Entwistle the consumate professional, Moon the finest and wittiest drummer in the world, Daltrey singing better than I ever did and would in the future and Townshend experimenting for all he was worth. Get the DVD on the making of this album. Its a gem. Can't rate this highly enough, I've been playing this for 30 years and can't imagine living without it.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This cd was an excellent choice. I am in my thirties with a teenage daughter. My daughter bought this cd while we were<BR>on an out of town shopping trip. While traveling we both found this very entertaining. I predict that \\"Walk Away\\" and <BR>\\"Beautiful\\" will be her next singles. It's nice to know there are cd's that can entertain both generations!!!!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Much has been said about Beck's mercurial nature. In the context of a follow-up to 1999's Midnite Vultures, Sea Change could be considered a polar opposite to that album's over-produced and unquestionably danceable tracks. Similarly, the lyrics on this effort actually make sense and are unabashedly poignant, while Midnite Vultures invited the listener to be \\"turn[ed] over to the highway patrol\\" and have his soul massaged.    Placed in the context of Beck's ever-shifting and decidedly mood-swing-inclined career, however, Sea Change seems completely natural. It re-pairs Beck with Nigel Godrich, who produced 1998's similarly dark Mutations (also a \\"surprising\\" follow-up, when placed in line with the commercial success of 1996's Odelay!). Never one to retread, however, this time Beck is joined by string arrangements (called \\"sweeping\\" in almost every review) put together by his father and also introduces a much more mature voice and more direct songwriting style to the world.    And oh the things that voice has to say. Easily Beck's best-written work, Sea Change never pretends not to be The Break-Up Album in Beck's eclectic canon. The titles alone are indications of the melancholy that pervades this album, but the beautifully somber imagery turns the singer/songwriter's sadness into the listener's gold.    Before releasing this album, Beck toured solo, playing acoustic shows dominated by the material from this album. Many of the songs blossomed in that raw environment and now seem almost stifled by the (albeit beautiful) production value with which this album surrounds them. The strings are indeed \\"sweeping\\" and an interesting choice, but could be criticized as being a detriment to the personal nature of this album.    In short, this is a wonderful, wonderful album. Highlights include \\"Lost Cause\\", \\"Lonesome Tears\\", and the opener \\"The Golden Age\\".
B000000WFZ|5.0|I think it has to be between this and Last Temptation of Christ for the best soundtrack crown. This album is pretty much faultless in its entireity. 'On Earth' and 'Gabriel's Oboe' are familiar tomost, but they never loose their beauty. The production on the CD is superb, with the oboe sounding crisp and drums sounding suitably atmospheric. It blends classical and world musics absolutly seamlessly and musically is in an entirely different sphere to his work on westerns. I had not seen the film before i bought it, and would recommend you buy that also, as it is a wonderful story which brings you to tears with the helpof this soundtrack. Those who say it is repetitive are missing the point completely - does nobody understand reocurring motifs? The main theme pops up again and reflects the story with it's dramatic variations. One more point - the choir parts are some of the most beautiful music ever recorded.
6304806426|5.0|First, I have watched this at least a dozen times and still cry in places. Perhaps people who hate this movie can't find a character they can imagine themselves being.(I see myself as the nurse Hana -- wonderfully played by Juliette Binoche!-- a badly traumatised human being fighting to hang on to her humanity in the midst of horror and tragedy.) This is about imperfect people in a flawed, often cruel and ugly and apparently pointless world, trying to find meaning and beauty and love and achieving it -- at least for a few precious moments. It is a movie that says that although there is no everlasting happy ending, there is still hope. If you are at all sensitive (and, no, you don't have to be wearing lip gloss) this movie will haunt you forever.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|It's easy to be critical of the portrayal of schizophrenia if you understand it well, or if you are schizophrenic yourself.  However, I know little about the subject.  Further, I know very little about John Nash's life.  Therefore, any criticism related to either I must ignore because of the beauty of the movie and the triumph of the character.<br />John Nash is one of those very rare people on spaceship earth:  a true genius.  The movie does a pretty decent job at providing examples of his genius.  There's no need to dwell on the subject, because it's pretty evident from his mannerisms that this guy is in a place that you and I will never truly understand.<br />Russell Crowe is more than good in the role of John Nash, he is truly outstanding.  As I compare his performance in &quot;Gladiator&quot; to his performance in this movie, which stretches his abilities significantly in areas that &quot;Gladiator&quot; merely explored, I have come to realize that Russell Crowe is a one of the great actors of our time.  Perhaps schizophrenia is not as seamless as portrayed in the movie, but with 120 minutes to work with, I was thoroughly convinced.<br />I was also very absorbed by the choice that Nash made.  He could either keep taking the medication, or choose to fight his problem and regain his mathematical abilities, and some control over his life.  He chose the second.  To make such a choice reminded me of Charlie in a similarly poignant story, &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, which was the basis for the movie &quot;Charley&quot; with Cliff Robertson.  Only in that story Charlie had no choice he could make other than to fight.  In a way, Nash fought and never truly won, but was able to overcome his difficulties well enough to be functional.<br />Jennifer Connelly, who I enjoyed in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;, among others, is all grown up and performs at the same level as Russell Crowe, well deserving of an Oscar.  Jennifer too deserves the appellation of &quot;great&quot;.  She will definitely be in high demand in the future.  By the way, she is prettier than she has ever been.<br />This edition of the movie features 2 discs with all kinds of extras.  I don't quite understand why the full screen edition costs more than the wide screen edition (which is what I purchased), but either is worth the price.  I won't bother to give you all the extras you get, but there is a lot.<br />I found that at the end of the movie I got a bit teary-eyed, and my wife did not.  After discussing the movie with several other people, I found that for some reason this movie tends to be more emotional for men than women.  I was unable to find a good reason for this, but I find the phenomenon interesting, since usually it is the other way around.  My point is that if you found the ending moving and left you with a really good feeling, then you probably understood the movie and this is clearly a movie you should own.  If you sat there and said to yourself, &quot;What in the heck was that all about?&quot;, then this isn't the movie for you.car.  Jennifer too deserves the appellation of &quot;great&quot;.

B00006JL1Z|4.0|This album was a fantastic opportunity to gather all of Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits along with a large number of choice album cuts and fan favourites. For the most part it succeeds but like any &quot;Best Of....&quot; the quibbles are still there. You can tick off all the well known hits from Rhiannon, Don't Stop, Sara, Hold Me, Go Your Own Way, Tusk, Everywhere and the list goes on. Of the album cuts, it's great to see Landslide, Gold Dust Woman, Storms and the two songs from their earlier Greatest Hits, No Questions Asked and the lovely As Long As You Follow. On top of that we get one of the greatest songs never to make an album, Silver Springs, surely still one of the worst oversights of a band that were making impeccable pop music.<br />&quot;The Very Best Of...&quot; is only let down by the inclusion of some of the minor singles - better to have Tango In The Night than Family Man, I'd rather have Save Me or the Lindsey Buckingham-guesting Behind The Mask than Skies The Limit while I'm sure Christine McVie would like to be remembered more for Brown Eyes than the slight Think About Me. These are minor oversights but like the dropping of Silver Springs from Rumours, they show a band that is capable of making mistakes.<br />That said we will forgive them and Fleetwood Mac, on the evidence of this album, are still the premier purveyor of pop music for adults and there is little or no competition to push them from that mantle. And like every Mac fan, I can't wait for the new album next year......
B000002IJL|5.0|It doesn't-it really doesn't.  This soundtrack is solid.  There isn't one song worth skipping.  I love Stand By Me!!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Up until now I have always put Beck in my &quot;Fun Music&quot; category...Midnight Vultures has permanent rotation space in my stereo. This CD doesn't qualify as &quot;fun&quot;. It's more of a Sunday AM Coffee or post breakup kind of thing. Which is great. It's always refreshing to see an artist try a new style and Beck is fearless in wearing his heart on his sleeve. Just don't put it on to get the party started!
B00005LMBK|4.0|Do yourself a favor. Listen to it. I bet you'll like it.
B00005OWEG|2.0|Let me begin with saying that apocalypse now is one of my all time favorite movies so i was excited when i saw that they had rereleased it and then i saw in and now know why the scenes included in this version were deleted in the first place, because they take away from the continuity of the story line to me they became a destraction and towards the end were just plain annoying. You cannot improve on perfecton as this DVD proves so save some money and just buy the original.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Picks up the paranoid trip left off after Kid A. Haunting genius, that's expected from Radiohead. Will not disappoint.
B00006AG5N|5.0|I don't understand why everyone has a bone to pick regarding this recent Elvis release. I agree that RCA puts out way too many compilations but among all of them, this one should be a keeper. The songs have been remastered and the sound has never been better. Why a few have said the new sound is annoying, I have no clue. This collection does contain most, if not all, the best Elvis tunes, including &quot;A little less conversation&quot; which turned a 1 minute mediocure song into a dancing frenzy of a hit.
B0000542D2|5.0|One of the most fun movies of all time. It does a good job of reminding us that the Beatles, as well as musical geniuses, were cool guys that you wanted to be your friends.
B00006CXXU|5.0|If anyone dismisses Christina Aguilera based on her new single Dirrty, then you don't know what you're missing. While in my opinion Dirrty is a killer track with its hard beats and fierce vocals from Christina, there is not a track on the album like it. Its one of the many differnt styles Christina tries on her new album Stripped, one of the best albums in years. Christina strays away from the teen pop music that made her a star and delves into all different styles including funk, latin, metal, neo-soul, grunge rock, and R&B. Christina's voice is more powerful than it ever was, and she displays it best on the powerful, metal rock song Fighter, the inspirational Soar, and the stunning ballads The Voice Within and Cruz. Impossible, in which she collaborated with Alicia Keys is another highlight. The standout track on the album is Beautiful. The name says it all. It's one of the best songs of the year, and she stays away from the vocal gymnastics she usually does, and gives a stunning vocal performance on the song that should win Song of the Year at the Grammys. This is an incredible album that by far has surpassed all expectations. It's a groundbreaking album that will in no time be considered a classic.
6304708521|2.0|for die hards beatle fan, the admiration could be accepted well, but the time when Beatles did this silly film,...they were sick in heart & soul...the magic was not there. Ringo & Paul just filmed it with everyone in the bus. And then they made a tour with that magical bus.<BR>Wake up your minds all! there are many other much better rock bands than beatles, check out the songs remains the same (LED ZEPPELIN DVD) or LONDON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (DEEP PURPLE DVD). The magic performances were there.....!!!
0790729628|5.0|...watch the original theatrical version of Blade runner.  The Director's cut is where its at.  Dark, somber and nearly nihilistic view of the future that is so believable in its's portrayal of the dingy streets and wet, &quot;film noir&quot; atmosphere.  Hauer is creepy as hell!  Young is gorgeous, and Ford makes a perfect Deckard.
B000002UAR|3.0|yes this one is a bit better than a hard days night or please please me,..because musically the songs became more progressive than the early &quot;schei-Beat&quot; stuffs. I accepted this.
B00003CXC6|5.0|...one of the best movies ever made...anywhere.  Powerful acting, a thought-provoking rumination on the nature of memory, truth and self, and the gorgeous work of Kurosawa make this a masterpiece.  It has stood the test of time remarkably well...It is neither dated nor has it lost any of its' power over the years. Spellbinding!!!! (I have never employed that overused often pretentious word before, but Rashomon actually deserves the praise).
6304981635|5.0|Enter the Dragon was easily Lee's best movie! There is action all around and unlike some of Bruce's other films, all of the actors with speaking roles actually speak their own lines (unlike Chinese Connection where everyone sounds like George the Animal Steele).<br />I will admit that the story is a bit broad and vast and somewhat undetailed as to why he really wants to bring the cartel down besides the fact that they killed someone he knew but other than that, it's still very good and who could forget a young Bolo Yeung?<br />This is a definite must for all Lee fans, martials arts fans and even action fans. This has to be in your DVD collection and there's really not even an arguement about it. Seriously, get this one!
B00006F7S4|5.0|Deeply felt, this is the most emotional album Beck has ever produced and by far his best. I'm a huge fan of his, and I'll admit at first listen I wasn't that excited. But this album not only grows on you, it gets under your skin in a way that very few albums and even fewer musicians can. Comparable to Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen, with Beatles and Sonic Youth undertones (to name a few). Possibly a great tribute to Beck's muses, all those wonderful musicians who have inspired so many.
0812513495|4.0|Ender's Game<BR>Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a book about a boy who trains in space where military tactics are learned through games.  Ender has a tough journey and makes many enemies.  Everybody knows that the teachers survey everything the kids do, and put the kids to the test.  The real test is the game itself, there are usually two teams that fight fake battles.  This book shows that small people can do great things.  It is an exciting, easy to read book, time goes fast as you're taken through Ender's journey. <BR> Orson Scott Card made this book for people of most ages, it is a fairly simple book that captivating, once you start reading it's hard to put down.  This book takes you through a changing time in Ender's life.  He goes from looking up to the teachers to hating the teachers.  He also becomes much more mature as he goes through battle school.<BR> At the same time his brother and sister, who were both rejected from battle school, were influencing the world politically Peter is hoping for something bad, but Valentine wants the outcome to be good.  I think that this is a very important part of the novel because it contrasts the good from the evil.  Peter being the evil and Ender and Valentine being the good.  It is a battle between good and evil through the whole book.<BR> In my opinion Ender's Game is a great book, I like it the most because of Ender's brilliance and his search to find out everything he can about battle school without the teachers finding anything about him.  It keeps you on the edge almost the whole book wanting to find out what will happen next in the brutal world at battle school.  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and sci-fi.  It is a great book about a young boy trying to make it through battle school, but he doesn't know that the fate of the human race has been placed on his shoulders.
B00006LHYC|5.0|whoa again!<BR>she's italian but i can't hear her accent, she sings really really good<BR>i don't know why i haven't heard about her, she's really new for me but she has 7 albums and has sold 20 million copies around the world!!<BR>every song is nice for me, but my favorites are &quot;i need love&quot;(that will be the second single), &quot;do i dare&quot;, &quot;surrender&quot;(a truly hit in Canada), &quot;if that's love&quot;, &quot;love comes from the inside&quot;, &quot;every little thing you do&quot;, &quot;i do to be&quot;, &quot;without you&quot;, &quot;it's not goodbye&quot; and &quot;everyday is a monday&quot;, whoa! i think almost the entire album i like!<BR>people this is a very talented girl with a terrific voice, don't doubt to buy this album, highly recommended! 100%<BR>i'm sure you will love her
B00006V9A0|2.0|I haven't even bought this album and I already know how pointless this release is. I feel proud that I am the only  person here that didn't waste my money on this album. Then again, I feel ashamed because I am such a big fan and I don't have it. But hey - that's what they're trying to do. This is only a release for the big Nirvana fans so they'll be drawn into buying it otherwise they won't feel like a true fan anymore. I have every Nirvana LP and a bunch of their singles, along with countless bootlegs and rarities. None of this stuff is new to me. I suppose that some of the new fans would like this, which is why  I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. But anyone who is getting acquainted with the band should buy their earlier albums such as Nevermind, Bleach, In Utero, and Incesticide. There are a lot of great songs missing in this release. To name a few: Love Buzz, Big Cheese, Downer, Aneurysm, Dive, Molly's Lips, Polly, Drain You, On a Plain, Serve the Servants, Something in the Way, Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge on Seattle, Even In His Youth, Verse Chorus Verse. <BR>In addition, Nirvana wasn't exactly anything special when they started playing. They were a live punk band. They got lucky enough to go from underground to the big music scene. Any band could have done it around that time. True, they were a great band. But they weren't the Beatles. They simply played the right songs at the right time at the right places. Because Nirvana was an underground band and although they were classified as both \\"grunge\\" and \\"pop rock,\\" their true spirit was that of punks. If Kurt hadn't killed himself, he would've when this release came out. Just look at what Nirvana has turned into. Nothing but a bunch of legal documents and overpriced Greatest Hits Records.<BR>Like I said, I would recommend their earlier albums if you are starting to listen to them. If you have been a big fan for years, listen to these songs on the CDs you own already. Download the new single. Go out and buyan underground CD! Who knows, the band you pick up may be the next Nirvana.
0375402675|4.0|Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six is ingenious. I give this book a good rating, because of the concept and the action. This book is by far the most thrilling book I have ever read. Rainbow Six had me on the edge of my seat. This book also got made into a video game, and for that it would have to be a great book. Another reason I think this book is good is because of the characters are believable. This book has a great sequel. So I give this a 10 out of 10. Read this book and feel the action.
0060922583|5.0|I just wanted to say that rating a book you have never read is presumptuous and unfair. People come to these reviews for the opinions of those who have actually taken the time to read the material. This is a wonderful book with some astonishing information. If you would like a more scientific slant (but in easy to understand language) to the paranormal, read this book. Keep an open mind and be amazed.

6301963717|3.0|Gabriel Byrne had this really strong Irish accent, but it would come and go every few minutes. He would go from that to a regular American speaking voice. Weird. <BR>The movie had it's moments, but, it was pretty boring, all in all.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Thank goodness for Dido's new albulm, No Angel!  It's so refreshing to hear such creative music in this decade of comercialized, cultivated, 14 year old pop stars.  No Angel is beautifully written and produced with melodies that sink in deep and don't let you go.  You can't listen to this albulm without living the lyrics, and really feeling the emotion put into each and every song.  As a female songwriter myself, I can honestly say this is my favorite albulm this year.
B00006ZSAD|5.0|a beautiful piece of work. spiritually engaging, this album moved me from the start. if you like the classic acoustic bands such as, &quot;the carpenters&quot; and &quot;simon &amp; garfunkel&quot; then i highly recommend this album. it will inspire you to the last drop. listen to it, then take your acoustic guitar out into the woods and play till the sun sets or until you get eaten by a bear.
B000000OUJ|5.0|this album is a classic!genius gza is one of the best wu members out of the whole clan the best songs on liquid swords are (4th chamber,liquid swords and swordsman) i highy recommend this album!
B00005JKDQ|5.0|This is the funniest movie that I have seen since Aladdin.
B00005JKDQ|5.0|First of all I have a confession to make. I'm 39 years old and I absolutely love this movie!! My daughter purchased this for my birthday recently and I have watched it many times.<br />Billy Crystal has always been one of my favorite comedic actors. The vocal performance he delivers is maybe one of the best jobs of his career. John Goodman as the loveable blue top scarer &quot;James P. Sullivan&quot; also delivers a heartwarming performance. And the sweet adorable little Boo will melt anyone's cynical heart.<br />Visually this movie is remarkable. Pixar has developed a way to display the most subtle of human behaviors and emotions. In the realm of comedy it is not just the delivery of witty and sharp dialogue that brings laughter to its viewing audience but also well placed comical facial expression of its characters. In this aspect Monsters Inc is top notch!<br />So whether you're three years old or one hundred and three years old, this movie is one to be viewed again and again.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|What better thing can be said about it?  Some soundtracks are good, some are great--and a very few are legendary.  It's no wonder Howard Shore won an Academy Award for this brilliant soundtrack.<br />Overall, the music is quite dark, like the movie.  Mr. Shore does this by incorporating loads of vocals in his music, especially at the intense parts.  If you've ever heard &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; by Orff, this is very similar.  I actually like it better than the overplayed Orff, because this music reaches emotional depths that &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; would've never been able to.  Sometimes the vocals are soft and gentle as well as intense.  Sometimes he only has the basses sing, for a darker tone, and then he has a sweet Vienna-Boy's-Choir vocal sing a small solo, then back to the dark, powerful basses.  It's positively gorgeous.  One of the best things is how he manages to get the vocals to sing like instruments, (Track 13, &quot;Bridge of Kazad-Dun&quot; chants) which I don't think some composers do often enough.<br />The music is generally soft and flowing, but it's not difficult to pick out a melody.  When I first heard this CD, I thought, &quot;Man, this is boring&quot;.  But I only listened to the first track.  The next track, track 2, &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; is the lightest on the whole CD.  It's a bright, happy melody dealing with life in the shire.  If you notice, you can pick out a harpsichord playing in the background, sort of giving the feeling that the simple life is a noble, proper way to live--not running around and having adventures.  The &quot;Concerning Hobbits&quot; theme is repeated throughout the soundtrack, but each time getting more solemn and darker, like innocence lost...or having the ring becoming a heavier burden.  Wow!  What a great soundtrack!<br />The best soundtrack, by far (in my opinion) is Track 13, &quot;The Bridge of Kazad-Dun&quot;.  That one features the most brilliant melody, and also the most intense and climatic.  The vocals featured there are probably the best in the entire soundtrack.  Another great track is track 7, &quot;A knife in the Dark&quot;, with booming basses and drums, along with the choir-boy part.  It'll make you cry.  Track 12 and 16 aren't as intense, but they are still wonderful.  <br />I think the vocals are the thing that makes this CD.  It was wise of them to choose Enya to do several of the songs, she has the sort of Celtic/Elfish tone to her.  And the songs she sings are beautiful.  Thankfully, she's not too overdone, and is accompanied by orchestra for the most part.  One song that positively reeks of her style is the last song &quot;May it Be&quot;.  It, of course, features Enya, and is great, but I would've liked it to have real orchestral accompaniment on it.  Still, (I love Mr. Shore for this) an orchestral part is added to the last of it, (though in a different key) so it's not so different from the rest of the CD.  Much better than those soundtrack with great scores, then those silly pop artists.  I'd take Enya any day.  In fact, &quot;May it Be&quot; is probably one of those songs you'd want to turn the bass up real loud, roll down your window, and sing along with.  No, really.<br />Another part of the great vocals is the innocent choir-boy singing.  You hear him in the end of track 17.  He's the one that'll make you cry, not Enya.  And he symbolizes, in a way, the hobbitual innocence featured in the movie.  I love it.<br />If you have seen the movie, you may have noticed that the music is featured quite strongly throughout, so it doesn't need to be incredibly flashy to be dominant.  There are several parts where there are no sound effects, no talking, but just music featuring the deep emotional depth.  WOW!  Not enough movies do that, and I hope it catches on.  Mr. Shore probably realized that he had a great responsibility to carry the movie throughout.  Because of that, you'll notice that when Gandalf dies, there is total silence...shock, as though no feelings could ever protray the loss.  Then, shortly after, there are some action sequences, but the sad music is played over--meaning, those action sequences aren't overriden by the fact that they've just lost their deep friend.  Positively brilliant.<br />Although some have criticized Mr. Shore for not taking Johan De Meij's Lord of the Rings music and working with it, I think that Howard's music worked much better and had an even darker feel and brilliant melody.  I have no doubt that he listened to the music, as well as read the book, and did as much research as he could on the subject.  If you'll notice, the tracks are named after chapters in the book.  Pretty clever.<br />I can't go on about how great this soundtrack is, because I'm only limited to 1,000 words.  But I would reccomend to to everyone.  I can't stop listening to it--it's addictive.  I have no doubt that this soundtrack will not only pass the test of time, but it will be listened to and loved for years.  It's a living legend.

All the hype is true, they just rock.  there is not enough words in my vocabulary to describe this band.  although there has suddenly been an outpour of indie, underground bands, i think the strokes started it by putting out a great album without filler songs that you skip over.  it's like a soundtrack, all the songs were handpicked because they're all good.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina used to be my favorite singer, but then two things happened: 1. she became really immodest and, well, slutty. 2. She dissapeared for too long. I bought her Spanish CD and was very dissapointed. Her debut CD was one of my favorites. But STRIPPED is way better than either of those. It is much diiferent than either of those. Think Alicia Keys, who wrote one of the songs (Christina cowrote all but 1 of the others). Jazz, r and b, rock, pop, and adult listening all colaborate to make one heck of a CD. Parental note- this CD has a few words you probably consider offensive, and various pictures of Christina partially nude (you can't see anything you're not supposed to, though, like the cover). This CD is less about loving a boyfriend and more about loving yourself. Songs marked with * are standout tracks<BR>Stripped Intro- Kind of weird, I usually don't listen to intros at all. Cool lyrics though. About Christina being \\"stripped\\" of her pop image.<BR>*Can't Hold Us Down- Girl power song with true lyrics about double standards of men and women, good beat.<BR>*Walk Away- This starts out slow but is a catchy ballad about walking away from a lover that only uses you.<BR>*Fighter- MY FAVORITE song on the album, a rock song about getting stronger from a bad relationship. One of my dad's friends liked it too and he said it sounded like a Michael Jackson song (I wouldn't know- he was before my time, I'm 15)<BR>Primer Amor- Boring interlude in Spanish.<BR>Infatuation- A okay Latin song. Christina sounds cool saying the Spanish words (song is mostly in English).<BR>Love's Embrace- I dunno about this one, I have only heard it once.<BR>Loving Me 4 Me- Nice message conatined in the title. I love the poem at the end.<BR>Impossible- written by Alicia Keys, who I normally like, but this song is a little boring for my tastes.<BR>Underappreciated- Nice words explaining something most people know all about- being underappreciated.<BR>*Beautiful- I heard this song preformed on DavidLetterman and it made me buy the CD. Perfect lyrics about self-confidence (\\"We are beautiful no matter they say\\").<BR>Make Over- This reminds me of \\"Eyes Like Yours\\" from Shakira (one of my favorite singers). Too weird-sounding for my tastes.<BR>*Cruz- This is like \\"Graduation\\" from Vitamin C in that it makes me sentimental to the point of tearing up. About leaving home but missing it later.<BR>Soar- An awesome song about being yourself and \\"soaring\\". A really good ballad.<BR>Get Mine, Get Yours- Not so great. About one night stands. Enough said.<BR>*Dirrty- I'm sure you've heard this. A great dance track about partying.<BR>Stipped pt. 2- Good interlude. Listen for yourself.<BR>*The Voice Within- One of the standout songs about looking to yourself for strength. Christina sings to a \\"young girl\\" about trusting herself.<BR>*I'm Okay- The most emotional track on this album. Based on Christina's real-life family life when she was little, about her abusive dad. In one part (The first time she says \\"I'm okay\\") her voice breaks and she sounds like she is about to cry. So sad!<BR>Keep on Singing My Sing- Another self-confidence song. Really pretty.<BR>Bottom line: really very good. Different, but better, than her old CDs. I reccomend it.
0380713802|4.0|\\"Neither here nor there\\" <BR>by Bill Bryson<br />In the book \\"Neither here nor there\\" the American writer Bill Bryson tells about his adventures during his trips to Europe. The hole book is divided into twenty two chapters and every chapter tells the reader about a different place. In the first two chapters he describes his trip to the northernmost European town Hammerfest and in his typical sarcastic way he tells about the exhausting bus ride and the people he get to know. After an apparently endless journey by bus he finally arrives at Hammerfest. At first he is really bored in the small town as nothing ever seems to  happen there, but after he have spent some weeks in the dark Hammerfest, he starts to enjoy the easy way of living there. He gets to know the advantage of having time for things you usually can't do. Furthermore, he starts making friends with the Mayor and some other inhabitants. So at the end of his stay in Hammerfest he doesn't only has got to know most of the people there, but even has seen Northern Lights, which had been the reason for that trip. After the fascinating event of the spectacular  Northern Lights, that impressed him deeply, he decides to return  to Oslo, although for a moment he has doubts if he should leave Hammerfest so quickly<BR>He also remembers his first trip to Europe as a young man in the seventies, where he went by plane and got impressed by Europe and its people as it seemed to be so different from everything he had known before. He got to know the hospitality of a couple from Belgium and their Citroen 2CV as he hitch-hiked to find a room for the next few days. Although the wife didn't really trust him, the man was fascinated of him and wanted to spend more time with him, but Bryson himself thought that they had been very strange. So he was glad when he finally found a small hotel where he could stay. That summer he also tramped through Britain, Ireland, Scandinavia, Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Italy.
B000065U1N|4.0|Beside the fact that Im a huge admirer of the Scott/Scalia/Zimmer-team there is something else about this movie that just stroke a chord in me while watching it. Sure, you may see this as an action flick, after all theres two hours of constant gunfire in it - but there is more to it. This is why: Imagine a movie about war in which soldiers are not merely heroes because they have the American flag waving in the background, or are fighting for a greater good, but just because they are a bunch of boys thrown into a situation and environment they can not even begin to comprehend. Imagine a movie where eighteen year olds go into battle wanting to \\"kick some ...\\" and are faced with the horrific difference between training and real life, between \\"Quake\\" and Mogadishu if you will - for this is were real heroism is bred. Imagine a movie that doesnt promote the bombselegant target approach but discloses the atrocity and insanity of armed conflicts. If you loved \\"Pearl Harbor\\" you should not ruin your tight sleep with this movie. For all the others: This movie you will remember! Promise!
B00006L83N|5.0|This cd firmly places the band at the top of the neo-classical progressive metal mountain.  As good as DWoT, this cd has variation, with Rusell Allen showing the widest range of his vocal talents.  With several more aggressive sounding songs than previous albums by the band, they give the listener a new sound to go with songs very much in their previous styles, including the perfect follow up song, The accolad II.  The 24 min epic masterpiece The Odyssey, has all the makings of a great movie soundtrack, while making 24 min feel like 6.  If you liked any of their previous cd's, you will love this.  If you have not heard symphony x before, order this now, followed by all their previous cd's as they are grand prize for intelligrent metal listeners.
B00005YUPO|3.0|My son LOVED Baby Mozart so I thought this would be similar.  I think they were promoting their children too much to concentrate on the content of the video.  It still has some great scenes, but they are combined with some awful scenes.
B0000019HU|5.0|A band breaking up in their prime keeps everything honest. Imagine if the Stones had thrown in the towel after \\"Goats Head Soup,\\" or REM after \\"Document.\\" <br />\\"Spiderland\\" was a perfect ending to a phenonemal band.
B00006J3WH|5.0|Super. Much better than I had hoped. The whole cast work really well. The songs are excellent and the lyrics work on all levels. An excellent job by all concerned. I recomend this to all those who enjoy a good musical. More please.
B00006CXSS|5.0|What can I say?  Speilburg and Hanks have once again showed us a very realistic perspective on WWII, the men who were there and gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.  When I saw this epic series, I was astounded on how well it was put together.  This is, in my opinion, HBO's greatest mini-series to date.  I highly recommend this DVD which tell the compelling story of Easy Company.<BR>  From D-day to Hitlers eagle nest, this mini-series has shown me the horrors, spoils and consequences of war.  Once again, I give this mini-series 5 stars and recommend it to anyone, especially the WWII buff.
B00006690G|5.0|I will admit that I have never been an Eminem fan, but this album changed my view of him.  If you're old enough, I would actually recommend buying the explicit version.  It flows a little better than the clean album.  The songs are very near brilliant, and he makes his point clear in all of the songs.  His love for his daughter, and the reasons for his anger, really come across.  Even if you've never listened to, liked, or read about Eminem, you should definitely buy this album.  You will get much more than your money's worth.
B00006G8G4|5.0|Obviously, I enjoy the film. I'll leave reviews of that up to other people. I want to write about the limited edition collector's gift set.<br />The extra DVD is worth the price of the set if you are a comic geek such as myself. The interviews with Stan Lee are wonderful. Watch and learn again why we love this man so dearly (though Kevin Smith might have stopped saying \\"uh-huh\\" and \\"right\\" after almost every word Stan said). The interview with Stan's wife is equally delightful. We get to listen to The Man read a fantastic poem he wrote years ago, and we are treated to some home movies! The comic reprint, the film cell and lithograph are definite Must Have's for any comic fan.<br />The \\"regular\\" DVD extras are also fantastic. The interviews with the different comic writers and artists bring a lot of insight into the evolution of our favourite Webhead, and the synopses of the various villains encountered by Spidey are great. I haven't listened to the commentary tracks yet, but am certain they will be great....

B00005JL96|5.0|It seems crazy to add another review to the hundreds already here . . . still, here goes.<br />LILO & STITCH is a charming and often hilarious film which goes slightly soggy in the second half due to a heavy dose of sentimentality (apparently obligatory in recent animated films.)  Adults alone will notice this, most children and teens will adore the film.<br />I noticed that the movie received mixed reviews in the media, some critics apparently bored by it.<br />What makes it exceptional for me is the quality of the drawing and the dazzling skill of the animators' work.  Backgrounds have the appearance of watercolors and the characters have a freshness and liveliness that is enchanting.<br />The two sisters and their ferocious alien pet are adorable in a way that very few recent cartoon characters have been.  At a stage when many audiences are tiring of overly-rendered animations, this NURB-free tour-de-force is very welcome.  I am not criticizing wonderful films like SHREK, TOY STORY or MONSTERS INC -- simply saying that a return to the freehand aesthetics of BAMBI (which LILO & STITCH in some measure offers) is a real treat.<br />We all know that computers are here to stay in the world of animation, but the Disney studios have made this animation look as though a highly skilled team of real, live artists hand-painted every cell.  That makes for rare and delicious fruit.<br />If you haven't seen this film, please do yourself a favor and enjoy a special treat!
0684830515|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a lot.  I found it to be short and simple with some great scenery and senses descricptions.  But in the end it is more of a self analysis book through drinking and eating from France to Spain and back.  I would have to say I preferred For Whom the Bell Tolls.  It has more of my kind of necessary drama through the fight for survival.  But, who could ever say that Hemingway isn't one of the most enjoyable writers if not the most challenging.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Beautiful voice.  Mature lyrics (no teeny bopper topics). Flawless production.  Successfully demonstrates versatility.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This cd rocks!!!  I love her voice, she does a great job with her new album.  My favorite song, of course, is \\"Dirrty!!\\"  The cd is perfect to dance to and perfect to think to, like \\"Impossible.\\"  If you like pop, alternative, or rock, you'll love this cd!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is simply awesome! From the opening credits to the final scene on the ball field, you'll be held spell bound as the story of these heroes unfolds. Mr. Hanks and Mr. Spielberg have created a truly spectacular work. The relatively new cast is incredible, the soundtrack simply beautiful, and the story awe inspiring. The scenery in a few of the episodes is stunning. The DVD transfer is very well done and the DTS soundtrack is great! This is a must see movie for all Americans! Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. You won't regret it!
B000002UAX|5.0|This a great album. It is one of the best projects that they have ever done. Worthy to be in any beatles collection.
038533558X|5.0|This was my first Coben book, so I can't compare it to \\"Tell No One.\\"  I cannot tell you if it's a rerun of his previous plots.  I can tell you that this is a superb thriller.<br />Part thriller, fully a mystery, \\"Gone for Good\\" starts with Will Klein's discovery that his older brother is perhaps still alive.  The questions mount:  How did his brother die?  Was he really guilty of murdering a teenage girl?  And the answers come only quick enough to lead to other questions.<br />When you think there are no more questions, you're wrong.<br />When you think you have all the answers, you're wrong.<br />Coben writes with a deceptively easy style.  He writes with a quick pace, yet never forgets to give his characters heart.  I found myself caring for these people, even feeling emotions in my throat once or twice.  He paints with a broad brush, showing rage, love, pain, sorrow, twisted violence, and family concern.<br />If you haven't read Coben, I'm sure you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.  If you're already a fan, then why'd you keep this guy secret for so long?
0812513495|4.0|In Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card used Foreshadowing really well.  Foreshadowing is where an author will show or indicate something before it happens. He would always start a chapter off with a conversation between two adults.  The adults would always be talking about what was going to happen in that particular chapter.  I think this method of writing is good because it can help the reader understand what is going to happen in the chapter.  This way if a reader gets confused they can always go back and reread the beginning of the chapter and it could help them fully understand what happened in the chapter.  This method of writing helps keep the novel more exciting and suspenseful, because you know what is going to happen however you don't know how it happens so you will want to keep reading until the end of the chapter because you want to find out what happened.<BR>     Along with foreshadowing Orson Scott Card used third person omniscient as the type of narration.  This type of narration helps him keep the readers in suspense as well.  Third person omniscient helps him get into the mind of all of the charters heads and helps the reader further under stand what is going on in the world and the time and in space with Ender.  Third person omniscient helps the reader know why Ender is afraid of peter and why the adults are not helping Ender.

B0000062FJ|5.0|Before SUPERNATURAL and SHAMEN, SANTANA released their debut album back in 1969. Even back then, this band was mixing rock, blues, and Afro-Latin music together into something magical. This album starts off with the instrumental WAITING which is a kicking tune and then jumps into the classic EVIL WAYS. SHADES OF TIME is another good song that you need to listen to. SAVOR and JINGO are two great jam tunes that show off how much talent this band has. The songs just wail with emotion and feeling. I also highly recommend that you listen to PERSUASION, TREAT  and dont forget to listen to SOUL SACRIFICE. This album also has 3 live bonus tracks that were recorded at Woodstock. Listen to the songs and see why SANTANA is a band that deserves all that it can get
0812550706|5.0|The novel, Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, is strengthened by the literary device imagery. It makes the novel better, because it helps you visualize what is going on in the novel. It also helps you feel the action in the novel.<BR>     In the novel, Ender's Game, Orson Scott Card uses imagery throughout the whole novel. The imagery that he uses makes the reader feel like they are in the novel. For example, \\"Ender went back to his bed to get his desk. As he leaned over to pick up the desk, he felt a hand jab roughly between his thighs and another hand grab his hair\\" (Card, 262). The imagery presented here by Orson Scott Card gives you a visual picture of what is going on. It also helps you feel the pain that Ender is going through.<BR>     Another imagery in the novel is, \\"His face and shoulders were being pressed into the floor by the old man's knee, while his back was excruciatingly bent and his legs were pinioned by the old man's arm\\" (Card, 262). In this passage, Orson Scott Card makes the reader feel the old man's knee pressing Ender's face and shoulders into the floor.<BR>     Therefore, imagery helps you see and feel the actions in the novel. Orson Scott Card does a good job of using this literary device. His writing makes you feel like you are in the novel.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think that Avril Lavigne's &quot;Let Go&quot; is an awesome CD.  I didn't know if it would be a good CD when I bought it or if &quot;Complicated&quot; would be the only good song.  But  all of the songs are awesome.  I like her music because she has a lot of different kinds of different songs on it for all the different moods that people have.  This is one of the main reasons I love her CD so much.  Another reason I love it is because not only are her songs great, but she wrote them all, too.  I think that is really cool that a young artist can be so talented at singing and also be able to write her own music.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Ahh, it's \\"Thick as a Brick.\\" As you probably know,<BR>this is the other of Jethro Tull's single song albums,<BR>which is really more like a medley of songs linked by<BR>musical interludes. The joke is that the lyrics are<BR>a poem authored by a boy genius who was unfairly<BR>stripped of the prize (boo!) Imagine that, humor<BR>in progressive rock. Who'd have thunk it? But I<BR>digress...<BR> As for the music, it alternates between sublimely<BR>melodic and plain ugly. The \\"comic books and<BR>super crooks\\" and \\"do you believe in the day\\" <BR>sections are by far the best. Either could have<BR>been hit songs on their own. I also really dig<BR>the second-side drum solos. Tons of gorgeous<BR>\\"classical\\" guitar vignettes too. <BR> Now for what I don't like...What's the deal<BR>with immediately following the opening \\"Thick<BR>as a brick\\" part with the grating \\"there are<BR>black heads on his shoulder and he pees himself<BR>in the night\\" part, easily the most annoying<BR>portion of the song? It is such a jarring clash<BR>in styles. Luckily the most annoying portion<BR>is relatively brief and doesn't kill TAAB for me.<BR> The electric guitar parts are also rather obnoxious <BR>at times as well, staccato bursts are no replacement<BR> for complex soloing. Just listen to the electric guitar <BR>sound on Yes's \\"Close to the Edge\\" or Genesis's \\"Selling <BR>England By the Pound\\" for comparison. That rich, complex <BR>sound is sadly absent from here. Oh, well. Still doesn't <BR>kill it for me but it marrs what would otherwise be an <BR>all-time classic. Lastly, some sections just drag<BR>on too long, especially near the end, before reprising <BR>the opening verse. Niggardly complaints, sure, just<BR>admitting that what many believe is a perfect album<BR>just isn't so perfect. I would set the score to a<BR>very high 4.5 if I could.<BR>  This is my second or third favorite prog album of<BR>all time. King Crimson's \\"Court of the Crimson<BR>King\\", KC's \\"Red\\", Yes's \\"Close to the Edge\\",and <BR>Genesis's \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" are better,<BR>however none have stronger melodies. If only Ian<BR>could have made the music a bit stronger to go<BR>along with the melodies.
0385508417|4.0|The book Skipping Christmas was an exciting and out of the ordinary novel, about a husband and wife that decide to skip Christmas for one year.  Have you ever wondered what it would be like if you skipped all the presents, lights (decorations), and most of all the amount of money that you spend? If you have, you should definitely read this book because it is fun and something way out of the ordinary.  If you are the person who likes to read about unusual things that people do, then you will absolutely love this book.
B000003JA9|4.0|No lengthly introduction for \\"Aqualung\\" is necessary. Come <BR>on, either you've already heard most of the good songs to <BR>death or you're not a rock music fan. \\"Aqualung\\" is one<BR>of those FM radio darling albums of the '70s, along with<BR>Supertramp's \\"Breakfast in America\\", Eagles' \\"Hotel<BR>California\\", any release by Led Zeppelin, etc, etc. Some<BR>albums deserve to be overplayed, though. Eagles can<BR>rot in the deepest pits of Hell for all I care but<BR>the Tull rocks. <BR> The title track, \\"Locomotive Breath\\", and \\"Cross-Eyed<BR>Mary\\" are the best known cuts because they are the best.<BR>\\"Aqualung\\" has just the right amount of complexity for<BR>for what it is (if that makes sense.) It's not quite<BR>prog nor is it quite your average hard rock number; <BR>angry riff-driven parts and pretty accoustic<BR>parts with a fantastic guitar solo. Lyrically it<BR>is a hoot. How many songs are there about old<BR>perverts who eye little girls \\"with bad intent?\\" I <BR>love it!<BR> \\"Cross-Eyed Mary\\" is apparently about a lower<BR>class little girl who is sexually exploited by<BR>older men. The allusions in the song to Aqua Lung <BR>are clever. Gotta love the descending flute intro.<BR> \\"Locomotive Breath\\" is played _so_much_ on radio.<BR>Does it even need description? For the ten poor<BR>souls who have never this song, it opens with a<BR>brief piano bit and then tells the story of the<BR>\\"all time loser\\" and his fateful day spent on<BR>a train, accompanied by train-imitating guitar<BR>riffs and flute playing. Maybe the best song<BR>on the album yet I prefer \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Wind-Up\\" <BR>a wee bit more.<BR> \\"Hymn 43\\" and \\"Wind-Up\\" are both obvious attacks<BR>on organized religion. \\"Hymn\\" combines a radio-<BR>friendly hook with \\"blasphemous\\" lyrics. If you<BR>are a fundamentalist Christian then listen to Amy<BR>Grant instead. \\"Wind-Up\\" is beautiful, musically and<BR>lyrically. How can anyone not like this song? Lyrics<BR>like \\"So I asked this God a question and by way of firm reply,<BR>He said I'm not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays.\\"<BR>are straight from the heart, whether you agree with them<BR>or not. Recommended for those who are not very religious<BR>and/or easily offended.<BR> The other tracks, besides \\"My God\\", don't do so much <BR>for me. \\"Mother Goose\\" is just way too silly and way too <BR>long. All things said, it is not progressive rock<BR>quite yet, but you can't deny the melodies, riffs,<BR>lyrical brilliance, and _talent_ on here. If you<BR>insist on only listening to progressive rock and <BR>hate anything that's popular (wait, wasn't TAAB a<BR>best selling album?) then avoid... Your loss.
0316666343|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in years.  Gripping, murder mystery on the surface; fascinating and interesting concept of heaven;  well developed process of family and community recovery after the death of a daughter/sister/friend.  This a must read book for anyone and everyone.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I hate to admit it, but this album is excellent. I am not a fan of this artist, but I heard the album because my niece has it. I was shocked at the vocal talent and quality of the songs used. I can't believe this is the Genie in A Bottle Girl! In comparison, the last Britney Spears album isn't half as good as this one. There are several beautiful ballads that I dare anyone with an open mind to listen to...Beautiful is just that Beautiful. Soar is also an excellent song.

Take, for example, John Lennon's famous line \\"imagine no possessions....\\"  This, coupled with his lavish life-style, accurately sums-up Mr. Lennon's legacy as the epitomy of 1960's excess and contradiction...the legacy of a man with a lot of advice, but, sadly, very little action.  <BR>Consider this: in an age of first and third world poverty and inequity, a condition which he raged against, John Lennon managed to spend more money on opulence and \\"chemical gratification\\" than many of us make in a lifetime.  This is documented.  Yet, he was cognizant for long enough to preach his shallow musings to the rest of us...\\"do as I say, but not as I do.\\"  Go figure!  <BR>A sad legacy indeed, this album aptly depicts, through sound and word, what was wrong with the both Lennon and the utopian dream of the 60's and 70's: a lot of big ideas with no tangible actions to back them up.  As a 1960's progressive icon, John Lennon did more by example to damage his cause than he probably ever realized, and one cannot honestly listen to his music without this context in mind.  After all, it's one thing to \\"imagine no possessions\\"; it's another thing give teeth to an otherside hollow and shallow fantasy.  Listener beware!!!
0783226063|5.0|In the tradition of other great filmmakers, David Lynch has set a benchmark with Dune. Stanley Kubrick practically created science fiction as a legitimate film genre with 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Lynch in his own right has done the same. Dune displays incredible photography with its distinctly different settings: the exuberance of the emperor's throne room, the industrial coldness of Geidi Prime, the arid wasteland of Dune; each world contains such attention to detail that the viewer can imagine such places possibly existing. This is quite the accomplishment considering the age of the film.<BR>The acting is very well done and the pacing of the film is acceptable (yet it does take an investment from the viewer. The film is usually only appreciated after seen a second or third time.).<BR>Whether the movie version is loyal to Herbert's novel or not, it is without a doubt a great accomplishment in film; much more sophisticated than the 6 hour TV series which is trite in comparison.<BR>A must for any serious sci-fi DVD collection!
0385484518|5.0|It's almost unfair to write a review for this book. It's unlike anything I have ever read before. It's neither a biography, a novel nor is it a self-help book. It's an incredible short story of a person's journey over the last bridge between life and death. I rarely cry as a result of anything which I learned from Morrie to be a slightly bad thing in that I do not like to show my emotions, but by the end of this story, my eyes were most definitely red. It's not a long book. I doubt it would take anybody more than a few hours to read, but it is very profound. There are a number of topics within which will force you to reflect on what you think is important and your life and maybe make you want to connect with a lost relative or friend too.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Faithfully reproduces what is the unique, true beauty of an AKUS concert. A joy to listen to.
B0000041DF|5.0|This recording of the Third Piano Concerto of Rachmaninoff was touted as \\"the ultimate Rachmaninoff 3rd.\\"  Actually, Martha Argerich did not want this performance released because of the mistakes she had made.  One would have to be a pianist of Ms. Argerich's caliber to find her mistakes.  The passion and brilliance she brings to this performance far outweighs any errors, and this is a performance that has come to be regarded as a standard against which to compare new recording.  Riccardo Chailly and the RSO Berlin provide magnificent support. <br />The Tchaikovsky First is played with similar brilliance and energy.  I also have Ms. Argerich's earlier recording of this concerto from the 1960s (on DG) and would say that this performance is broader and less driven than the former.  Ms. Argerich indeed likes to push the orchestra's tempo but I think she holds back a bit here and is more relaxed.  She gets great support from Kirill Kondrashin and the Bayerischen Rundfunks players. <br />As has been pointed out, these are live recordings and have been digitally remastered, but I found the sound quality to be excellent.  The audience is quiet during the performances; there is applause at the end of each concerto.
1878424319|5.0|I am convinced that whoever came up with the four agreements is a genius.  At first, I was so highly skeptical how four rules can remove misery from our lives.  But guess what?  Every problem I can think of that I'm having or had in the past deals with one, some, or all of these rules.  Unbelieveable!  Let me give you an example.  I was so in love with this girl, but I didn't really had the guts to tell her how I really felt and so one day, I lost her...she got married!  How did this happen?  Agreement #1, be impeccable with your word: I didn't tell her how I really felt and so I lost her.  Agreement #2, don't take anything personally: I took it really personally when she told me her decision.  I don't think I got over it for months until I read this book.  Agreement #3, don't make assumptions: I thought I was giving her enough signs to let her know already, so I don't really have to tell her.  Boy, was I wrong.  Agreement #4, always do your best: I guess I can't possibly be doing my best if I'm not even following the first three agreements!  Anyway, this is good stuff and all you ever need to live a beautiful life: be honest, don't be too serious, communicate clearly, and just do your best and not have any regrets.  Good luck!
B0000024IE|5.0|Those are the only 2 words that best describe the rush of sounds, voices and ideas collected on P. E.'s third studio LP. While &quot;Nation Of Millions...&quot; was a stunning release that completely re-wrote the rulebook in hip-hop, this 1990 followup is easily the most artisitc record in thier canon. &quot;Fear...&quot; works more as a sound collage and sonic painting than merely a collection of hits and filler, as most rap albums still are today. &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; samples Prince's shrieking guitar solo from &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot; over a whomping rhythm section and enough background noises to drive less adventurous listeners crazy. &quot;911 is A Joke&quot; is also another great tune that, deliberately or not, proves that Flavor Flav really can't rap at all. My personal favorite on this LP is the interracial dating diatribe &quot;Pollywannacraka&quot; with Chuck D.'s raspy, deep, drawling delivery coming as a real jolt and his views on dating outside your race may surprise some. Overall, &quot;Fear...&quot; is a lot less accessible than it's predecessor and that's a good thing, this LP makes you think and work a little for the big payoff. This is Public Enemy's real masterpiece, a sprawling, eclectic record that knows no boundaries. Essential Listening.
0553583182|5.0|When I first saw this book, I was very skeptical.  The title sounds like a cheap informercial.  After reading it half-way, I knew I have picked up something special.  I should actually thank my friend who recommended it to me.  This is the BEST BOOK I have ever read.  No, dreams do not come true by only dreaming about it.  Action is required.  But it is dreams that ignite that fire in all of us.  Whether or not the subconscious is real or not, who knows.  But I choose to believe it because it is very empowering.  Belief is empowering.  That is why religion works.  Basically this book is about believing.  When you have this problem and you just can't think of the solution and then one day, it just comes to you.  Or when you take this pill and you feel better but it is really candy (placebo effect).  Whether the subconscious is responsible for this (according to the book) or God or whatever you believe in, the only thing that matters is simply to believe!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is fantastic.  It is a movie I can watch over and over with my nieces and never get tired of it.  Even the two year old sits through the entire film.

THers only one song i HATE thats TIme of your life.<BR>THe other songs are so amazing...ive never heard songs that good(well maybe but its one of the best) my personel favriote is Adreline Rush and Wanksta<BR>THey got lots of other rappers there too. 3 eminem singles<BR>Dr Dre, Bizzare i think, just alot including Obie Trice. u really should but this album especially if ur an eminem fan
B00006LHYC|5.0|When Laura took Spain like a storm about 10 years ago, I really didn't think she would get this far. But with her incredible voice and enchanting persona, she has managed to achieve success after success singing in native Italian, then Spanish and Portuguese. Now her English-language debut shows a more mature Laura. The album focuses more in her ballad style, but also includes powerful up-tempo songs (&quot;Surrender&quot;, the first single, &quot;I Do To Be&quot;) and two adaptations of her Italian/Spanish hits: It's Not Goodbye (my all-time Laura favourite, &quot;In assenza di te&quot;, and &quot;Everyday is a Monday&quot; (Il mio sbaglio piu grande&quot;). I love &quot;Love Comes From the Inside&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing You Do&quot;. Pity that her  English tracks from previous European albums (such as &quot;Looking for an Angel&quot;, &quot;One More Time&quot; or &quot;The Extra Mile&quot;)have not been included as bonus tracks...a good reason to look for all her other recordings!. Good luck, Laura!
B00006690G|5.0|this IS the PERFECT ALBUM! Its got the perfect balance bewtween dissing, expressing his feelings, bizzare freestyles, thug related, and his past. Oh and one song(drips) whore related.<br />guess theres something for everybody
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is amazing it completly blew me away after I was done listening to all of the songs!! Christina voices such powerful messages, her songs are something for the soul. Her voice is beautiful. She has matured and changed for the better! She no longer is the shy girl doing what people tell her, but an adult doing things her style, and I admire that. Her CD is her and it's wonderful, just like Christina.
B000069CWE|2.0|what the heck is up with this album? All they did was take the good hybrid theory songs and every other song from singles/import and then they added sound f/x. O yea the CHORUS, 75% of the songs is chorus. and the music video(re animated  &quot;Pts. Of. Athry.) which comes with the cd is stupid. Its about a alien war thing, Points of Authority isnt about war lol. I do not recomend this to anybody who really liked their first album. they were not original.
0066620996|5.0|I believe what James Collins says in &quot;Good To Great&quot; is of considerable value to American business. It provides anecdotal information on how businesses can become great. I have also taken the advice of others who have read &quot;Good To Great&quot; and gone on to read &quot;West Point: Character Leadership Education...&quot; by Remick, a very educational corollary to &quot;Good To Great&quot; that teaches the philosophical underpinnings to what James Collins says in &quot;Good To Great&quot;. Setting up West Point as a metaphor for America, the Remick book is, like James Collins' &quot;Good To Great&quot;, of critical value to American business. Collins teaches the American business community how to be great. But, it must never cease to be &quot;good&quot;, a different kind of &quot;good&quot; - having morals, ethics, honesty, and character. For, like America writ large, if it ceases to be &quot;good&quot;, it will cease to be great. We are seeing how true that is in corporate and financial America, lately. It could be devastating to our economic system. James Collins' book professionally tells you how to go from good to great. He does a wonderful job. The Remick book tells you how to remain great by also remaining &quot;good&quot;, a different kind of good. These books may not be for everyone, but they work for me in the corporate America I know.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|Don't buy this album expecting Portishead.  Gone are most of the elements of trip-hop.  Beth Gibbons explores a new set of vocal stylings along with the new accompanyments.  There are many moments where the typical Protishead fan would have a hard time recognizing Gibbon's voice.  For example, I think she sounds a lot like Billie Holiday on the track \\"Romance.\\"  There are also tracks where her voice (and the mood of the music) remind me of Tori Amos or Karen Carpenter.  For those of you who hate any attempt to compare the sound of one artist to another, suffice it to say that this album sounds pretty retro- borrowing from a few different time periods.  I love Portishead, but I think I am going to grow to love this album as well (I have listened to it about five times). I think it is definitely worth owning if you have enjoyed Beth's previous works....
B000002KIK|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out in the late 70's.  After the very disappointing \\"Technical Ectasy\\", I didn't know exactly what to expect.  \\"Never Say Die\\" is the best and most creative Sabbath album since \\"Sabbath Bloody Sabbath\\".  The guitar work is awesome and Ozzy is strong.  It's also the last great Sabbath album, although \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was pretty good.
0312965788|4.0|Given that the usual age-group of Herriot's readers are late teenagers, the book came a little late into my hands. Dr. James Herriot puts across his trials and tribulations as a novice vet, &quot;a Mr. Smartpants&quot;  among hardy Yorkshire Dalesmen who are convinced of the superiority of their own home-grown remedies but nevertheless make calls at all odd hours whenever a horse is foaling or a cow is &quot;running on only three pistons&quot; (one of the four udders is calloused). Great descriptions of the picturesque countryside and an incisive observation of character (including his own) makes this an intersting read. Since at times there seems to be very little plot in the whole book, it is nicer if you read it just as a collection of anecdotes(some humourous, some tragic, some strangely both) about a young man about to start out in life. A lucid prose style and powerful narrative skils makes this a very satisfying read on the whole.
B000021YQV|4.0|Most nu-metal bands seem to have forgotten what metal is about. Fortunately, System have not. Despite being what most would call an old-school metal fan as well as an extreme metal fan (I listen Iron Maiden type stuff and death metal as well) I have to say that this is a great album. In fact, I'm in question whether or not System Of A Down are even nu-metal. They certainly relate to what the scene used to be, despite having a very original sound. But with the nu-metal scene as it stands now with terrible rap-rock bands like Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park and Papa Roach at the forefront, System are very different.<br />Firstly, guitarist Daron Malakian isn't just another detuned power chord merchant. This album has some technical stuff on it. Nothing special, but still some variety in his playing. Secondly, Serj Tankian has a great voice and experiments a lot with it. Thirdly, they don't rap (thank God!). The best tracks include Prison Song, Needles, X, Chop Suey and Shimmy.<br />This isn't as good as the debut though. The songs don't really have their own individual character like they did on the self-titled, and Toxicity isn't as consistently good. Deer Dance and Boucne are all good tracks in themselves but they tend to merge together and all cover explored territory. On the debut the variety was greater and and there was a sense of individuality to each song. I would recommend the self-titled over this. Nonetheless, this is still a cool album.<br />To the more elitist metal and rock fans who look down on nu-metal (I suppose that for the most part I'm one of those!): - if you want a heavy album with an original sound, then ignore any prejudices you may have of this band and buy this album.
0385484518|5.0|This book was amazing!  I picked it up as a hard headed person with my own view on the world and how it works.  After listening to all of Morrie's life stories and lessons to be told, I put the book down as a totally new person!  It's sad but in one book, I learned more in a few hours than in my whole life!  There are certain books that are best for people to read for certain trials in their lives, Tuesdays With Morrie is good for all of those trials!  I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for some good laughs and cries.

B000000QFY|5.0|Focus should have been massive but they made one fatal mistake. They didn't come from England. In 1970s the UK music scene was very strong and therefore self-sufficient and anything not home-grown was viewed with suspicion. Focus produced four superb albums, crafting a finely balanced blend of classical, jazz and rock n roll. Progressive rock in the purest sense of the word.<br />Moving Waves is in my opinion their crowning achievement. Focus III and Hamburger Concerto  are great though marred by passages of unnecessary indulgence. Moving Waves is a pristine example of musical genius. What do they sound like? Well, I’ve always thought they sounded like Camel would have done had they attended the Royal College of Music for three years. Both bands have much in common, though I must say that Moving Waves is a record Camel could only have dreamt of doing. Best tracks? Moving Waves plays vfrom start to finish - yes even Hocus Pocus - although I like the beautoful title track and Eruption in particular.  Many would say Focus actually comes closer to being Fusion rather than Rock, but here I would disagree. Moving Waves is as rock n roll as they come. Or I’m a Dutchman
B0000542DG|5.0|Very original.  And there's no serial killer!  Although it is quite bloody.  I highly recommend this movie and don't get why it doesn't have an average 5 stars???
0393312836|5.0|Please read this version as it has the oft-omitted 21st chapter which gives the book a different tone,in other words it doesn't condone violence as much as the movie seemed too(at least on the surface) Also,don't be put off by the \\"Nadsat\\" slang used by Alex and his peers: there's a very good website that has translations. Just read this book, whether you love it or hate it,you'll probably never forget it..
B00003CXI1|3.0|I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone between the publications of the second and third books, and have enjoyed them all. When I saw the trailer for the film, I was intriquged. Alright: I wanted to see the movie. A great book, and the trailer was good (although I know well that modern trailers are no indicator of quality). What's not to like?<br />In fact, even watching the movie, I had difficulty finding the flaws. Most of the scenes worked quite well. A violent chess match towards the end of the film was probably the best moment of the film. And none of the acting is really at fault. Richard Harris, how we will miss you, come the third film (note: Harris, who died recently, played Professor Dumbledore). However, although the parts have no major flaws, (forgive the cleché) sometimes the whole is less then the sum of the parts: for whatever reason, the Sorcerer's Stone is flawed.<br />If I were to hazzard a guess, I'd say the editing is to blame. The movie seems badly paced, with too much time before school starts, cramming the rest of the plot into too small a time period. And some information is given in a far more forced way then it is in the book. There are a few other facets that could have use some major improvements.<br />However, Chris Coloumbus may do right by the second book. The stakes are lower (The Chamber of Secrets is, so far, the low point of the series), as are (my) expectations. He could make it a much better movie then it's precessor. If not, there's a new director for the third. I, with reservations, anticipate the sequal.
B00006CXXU|3.0|Christina's new album strives to shatter her previous teeny-bopper image with darker, edgier, and more adult songs that showcase her powerfully mature voice.<br />The tone and style of \\"Stripped\\" may come as a bit of culture shock to some, as Christina tackles songs with a blusier, R&B sound.  In \\"Walk Away\\", for example, Aguilera does her best Etta James impersonation, delivering an emotional, soulful performance far beyond her age.<br />Admittedly, there are a few catchy, derivative hip hop tracks, such as the debut \\"Dirrty\\", and the Destiny's Child wannabe, \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\".  However, it's hard to justify this type of criticism in the popular music genre where what is considered 'good music' is not necessarily what people find entertaining and fun to listen to.  <br />For instance, a song like \\"Fighter\\" can either be construed as Christina's homage to Janet Jackson's \\"Black Cat\\", or a blatant rip-off, depending on your opinion of the singer.<br />I would lean towards the former view, though, as the Linda Perry collaborations \\"Beautiful\\", and \\"Make Over\\" contain similar guitar/alternative rock influences.  Each of these songs also help prove that Christina is a versatile singer, capable of success in any genre.<br />Unfortunately, not every track works--the tiresome, by-the-numbers ballad, \\"Loving Me for Me\\", and a rather non-descript Alicia Keys song, \\"Impossible\\" come to mind.<br />Ultimately, if there's any fault with \\"Stripped\\", it's lies in the album's utter determination to prove Christina's self-perceived \\"loss of innocence\\".  At it's worst, \\"Stripped\\" tries a little too hard to prove itself.  The song lyrics--alluding to a kind of breaking out sexually, emotionally, and personally-- seem forced and redundant by the album's end. If Christina ever wanted to hit people over the head with her newfound independence, \\"Stripped\\" is certainly her hammer to do so.<br />Despite these minor gripes, \\"Stripped\\" is solid sophmore effort from a gifted singer who hasstill just scratched the surface of her career.<br />Although fans who enjoyed the upbeat pop tunes of the debut Christina may miss that persona, there is no denying that the new image is step forward for the artist professionally. Here's hoping that future releases continue to develop a very talented young singer.
B000002AZZ|4.0|I must admit, Leonard Cohen bounces back and forth between my #1 and #2 spots on my \\"best musicians of all time\\" list (he and Tom Waits switch places depending on my mood).  Yet with the exception of his first album I find it hard to give any of his albums five stars.  Typically Cohen includes a few songs that simply aren't as evocative or haunting as the masterpieces that peek out between them.  On this disk that slot is taken by the songs \\"Why Don't You Try\\" and \\"Is This What You Wanted?\\".  Both songs limp along ably enough to their finishes; it is just that in contrast to the genius displayed elsewhere by Cohen, they come off as filler songs that push the total track number up high enough to call this an album.  These are songs that lesser lyricists would be happy to call their best, but with my higher standards for Cohen I am still holding out for an album as consistent as his first.<br />You may be wondering now why I count Cohen as my first-or-second favorite artist after I have expressed such opinions about his music, and the reason is simply this:  that when he's good, he's so good that he blows everyone else away.  One of his greatest songs is on this album:  \\"Chelsea Hotel #2\\".  This song at first drove me, like Dylan's \\"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35\\", to wonder where the first version of \\"Chelsea Hotel\\" had gone.  but after one listen to the song, I decided it was irrelevant.  The version Cohen has here is flawless.  I have heard that this song was written for Janis Joplin, but personal details become unnecessary in the face of such a heartfelt and powerful song.  One does not need to have had the exact experience Cohen describes to understand the feelings he is converying; you only need to have one \\"fallen robin\\" in your past and his song can mutate into your story, told better than you ever could tell it.  The song also contains a bitter and ironic last verse that rivals \\"Dress Rehearsal Rag\\" on \\"Songs of Love and Hate\\" for reversal of audience expectations.<br />But don't think that's the only good song here.  \\"A Singer Must Die\\" is a poignant allegory, one even more relevant as we witness loss of traditional civil liberties in the US and in other parts of the world.  \\"Who By Fire\\" is justly ranked among Cohen's best also, detailing what I hear as a list of different ways to die, though I would welcome remarks from anyone with a different interpretation of the meaning of this song.  \\"Who by Fire\\" also demonstrates the proper way for Cohen to integrate the choir of females he employs as back-up singers into his songs in a tasteful manner.  In later albums he seems to abuse their existence, allowing them to upstage his mellow, despairing voice.  But here they blend perfectly.  Finally, \\"There is a War\\" foreshadows Cohen's explicitly political turn in his later album \\"The Future\\".  All in all, this ranks among Cohen's better recordings, and it is worth wading through the mediocre tunes to get to his true gems.s.<br />But don't think that's the only good song here.  \\"A Singer Must Die\\" is a poignant allegory, one even more relevant as we witness loss of traditional civil liberties in the US and in other parts of the world.  \\"Who By Fire\\" is justly ranked among Cohen's best also, detailing what I hear as a list of different ways to die, though I would welcome remarks from anyone with a different interpretation of the meaning of this song.  \\"Who by Fire\\" also demonstrates the proper way for Cohen to integrate the choir of females he employs as back-up singers into his songs in a tasteful manner.

B000063S6Z|2.0|I mean, I dig a lucious melody as much as the next dude, but when you couple that with feeble lyrics about saving the planet (good luck dude), then you've lost my interest.  The sad thing is, this bald little musician is actually pretty talented, but he has the musical consistency of a chameleon in the desert.  In my view, one can only get away with changing up your musical style each album in selected spots.  BUT THIS GUY IS CHANGING HIS STYLE EVERY 2 MINUTES - IN THE SAME SONG, NO LESS!!<br />Moby needs to pick a style and stick with it.  He should start with a mosh/metal album and move on from there.  Plus, he needs to retire the feeble lyrics that make him sound like a girl.  Yeah, I'm all for non-violent resistance, just like Mahatma Ghandi, but this guy is just way too wimpy for my taste. <br />You're better off checking out Eminem's latest record, as well as the dope tale about his personal life, soon to come on the big screen: \\"8 Mile High\\", yo.<br />Check it out, dudes.<br />SEE YA'!!!!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I haven't seen a movie that I enjoyed this much in a long time!  And it wasn't bloody or anything like that.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00005V331|5.0|This is great!! Who knew years later, I'd give these guys another spin; and who new how well this stuff holds up!!! I'd tried to avoid Venom. For example, when I felt the urge I would try to sedate it with Motorhead; it didn't work. Nobody else does, or has done what these goofballs did(and without resorting to arson!!) Yes, there is dubious lyrical content, BUT the whirlwind of sound is irrisistable, and pretty soon I'm laughing with glee. The songs are extremely catchy, not like the unlistenable claptrap of the genre which these boys spawned. \\"Sons of Satan\\" is undeniably cool; pulls ya right in at the beginning. \\"Welcome to Hell\\" is a fist pumping anthem. Another fave is \\"Witching Hour,\\" a companion piece to the Misfits' \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" if you will. Great for dark and windy autumn nights. Highly addictive, AND groundbreaking noise!!!
B00006L3S3|4.0|Im a big Lennon fan, but the old Mind Games CD was one of the albums I listened less. Now I bought these new edition of Mind Games  here in Argentina and become a favorite. These remaster sounds great. Aisumasen, Out the blue and One Day at a time are beautiful songs.<BR>Now Im waiting for WALLS AND BRIDGES and ROCK &amp; ROLL Remasters.<BR>Thanks Yoko.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers can easily qualify as a classic example of great cinematic achievement. The beauty of the story is that it is true. One can identify with the emotions that the characters undergo. <BR>The casting of relatively unknown faces was a novel idea, as one does not relate the actors to any of their previous works. The DVD quality is great and loaded with information, as well as interviews and behind the scenes footage.<BR>I would recommend Band of Brothers to all history buffs. A great buy.
B000002IZM|5.0|A truly amazing album; the greatest electronic soundtrack ever. My favorite soundtrack along with Dances With Wolves. Vangelis succeeds with many different styles of songs here, from cold electronic soundscapes to haunting, beautiful orchestrations. It absolutely goes perfectly with the movie. There's nothing I like more than a fat, fat synth just laying out a thick melody. Powerful stuff.<br />Main Titles-Sets the stage for the amazing visuals. Breathtaking highs and lows. Fat analogs-love it.<br />Blush Response-I love the dialog. That devious hum in the background keeps you unnerved.<br />Wait For Me-Decent.<br />Rachel's Song-An incredible minimalist composition for any genre. Mary Hopkin's ethereal vocals seem like an angel lost in liquid space, gently calling to you. The choral synth voices towards the end portray a grandiose experience, just overwhelming you. Beauty turns to awe and danger. What a beautiful song.<br />Love Theme-Kind of cheesy, until the end. A great resolution in the last 10 seconds.<br />One More Kiss, Dear-Very cool! Old 30's style love song. Love it.<br />Blade Runner Blues-Kind of cheesy, portrays that bar scene feeling.<br />Memories of Green-Just like Rachel's Song, totally gorgeous on it's own. Piano coupled with synth, that harsh, subtle digital background with the beauty of the melody. Like a computer or robot trying to become human. Cold mechanics trying to feel emotions.<br />Tales of the Future-An interesting electronic-Eastern experiment.<br />Damask Rose-A beautiful Eastern-sounding meditation. Spirituality coupled with the mechanations of humanity. Beautiful redemption in the melody towards the end.<br />End Titles-A dissonant ending-what will the future hold? The melody seems unsure, questioning our intentions.<br />Tears in Rain-I like it! Rutger Hauer's finest moment (unless you count Blind Fury :)), a touching moment of transcendence for the replicant as he realizes the essence of being truly alive. Like Pinocchio, he getshis wish in the end. Maybe his realization of being human is that you have the release of death, foregoing the prison of immortality that many replicants may feel in the future? Robots committing suicide-now that's an intersting thought.
0812550706|4.0|In Ender's Game Orson Scott Card uses the literary term foil, many times though out the novel.  The literary term foil, helps strengthen the novel.  This is because of how Scott, uses it to compare and contrast all of the different characters.  One of those instants of foil, is Ender and Peter.  Another foil found, is Valentine and Peter.  The last foil is Ender basically against most of his battle school.   These three foils shows how different people contrast in the novel.<BR> The first time that foil is shown in the novel is Peter against Ender.  Peter is the older brother of Ender and constantly bully's and treats Ender as if he is nothing.  Ender takes all of the things Peter does to him, but in his head he wishes Peter would die.  The reason Ender thinks this is because Peter tells him that he will kill him if Ender doesn't do something for him.  Finally, when Enders rage all finally comes out, he takes it out on a school bully and not Peter.  Even after this Peter still bully's and treats Ender bad.  <BR> The second foil found in Ender's Game is Valentine and Peter.  Valentine is the middle child in the Wiggin  Family and Peter also bully's her in the beginning of the novel.  He treats her the same way in which he treats Ender.  But, after Ender is taking away to Battle School, Peter stops the bullying and starts to getting good grades.  Valentine soon figures out that Peter and Ender were almost the same, expect Ender would never act in the way Peter does by bullying.  <BR> The third foil that is in Ender's Game, is Ender against his Battle School. At Battle School Ender is an outsider, because he is new, young, and dose not  know what will happen there. Then, to make it worse, Ender helps win a battle and becomes Number 1 on the ratings at Battle School.  This makes all the kids at Battle School despise Ender.  Ender soon finds out that Battle School is not all that great, but he still stays in the top spot of the standings.  This foil shows that if someoneis good at something, but someone else is not, you will be despised.<BR> The foil that Orson Scott Card uses, does help in reading his novel Ender's Game.  This is because he uses it to show a different prospective on how life is like when everyone seems like any enemy to you.  Also, Card uses it to bring out different sides to characters, that we don't see usually.  The literary term foil is one that helps create a different tone on the whole novel, which Orson Scott Card does well.
B00005RYLE|5.0|Man, I don't care what nobody says, Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' is one of the greatest horror films ever made. No, I'm serious. This is one of the most original and appealing films to come along in all of modern cinema, by far. Will everyone enjoy it? Probably not, but only because not everyone will understand why it's such a masterwork. Some will only look at it superficially as a ridiculous, gratuitously violent horror movie. But, if you are a true lover of film, an' I don't mean stiff-necked over-analytical critic of film, I mean a TRUE LOVER of motion pictures, an' the fun an' magic of sitting down an' losing yourself in a nice slice of pure entertainment, then you SHOULD really love, or at the very least appreciate this. <br />These young film students that pieced this monstrosity (an' I mean that in a good way) together back in the late '70s clearly had the biggest an' brightest imaginations an' a true love for the magic of the movies. Is it cheesy? Sure. Is it violent? Hell yeah, it is, probably the most violent of the whole trilogy. But, is it a ball to watch? By all means. The establishing shot alone heavily influenced a lotta lesser horror movies in the '80s. Is' a long tracking shot across a dirty, swampy lake, an' through the backwoods toward the main road as our unknowing group of college kids drive toward an isolated cabin in the country where they plan to spend a weekend. <br />When they arrive, once they've done a quick run-through of the broken-down shack, they discover some strange findings in the cellar; a shotgun, a few medeival-looking knives, and, most importantly, a tape recorder and a rubbery-looking old book, that turns out to be what the whole movie revolves around. As the friends sit up at night an' listen to the unknown doctor on the tape recorder reciting some strange demonic chants, as they flip through the chilling book whose pages are covered in strange lettering an' drawings of devils an' spirits... okay, I know what you're wondering; are these kids really stupid an' careless enough to unlock some otherwordly spirit an' awaken the dead to wreak havoc on the five of them. who are hopelessly stuck in the middle of nowhere? Well, to put it bluntly, YES. What follows is one of the most relentlessly bloody an' violent films I believe I've ever seen. It's like the filmmakers went to painstaking lengths to find out where the most awful an' horrific spot would be to stab people (The acchiles tendon, as Bruce Campbell's commentary points out). I mean, there is some really raw an' shrill moments of gore that actually put even the 'Evil Dead' sequels to shame, including a truly sick an' disturbing sequence involving one'a the girls an' some lively trees, with some very, uhhh, BUSY branches. To make a long story short, one by one each of the kids end up bein' possessed by the demons an' turned into bloodthirsty zombies, except for Bruce Campbell's character, Ash, who'll end up being the lone warrior in the sequels.<br />I had this movie in its original special edition for a while, but when this limited edition \\"Book of the Dead\\" came out, there was no way around it, I hadda have it. The rubbery binding of \\"human flesh\\", the unreadable lettering an' demonic drawings of ancient myths an' devilish spirits, ohhhh man, any fan'a this movie'll eat this up. There's no real making-of featurette, but there is a retrospective with all the producers, as well as some old behind-the-scenes footage on the set, including outtakes. This footage looks like it was dug outta some crates that it'd been in for the past twenty years or so. I was also surprised to see TV spots, not only because it was such a low-budget movie, but also because of the limited release it received, cause'a the graphic nature an' the fact that it was unrated. The two commentaries are fun to listen to, mostly 'cause these guys're so snide an' sarcastic about their movie, especially Bruce Campbell (\\"I'll be quiet, cause, uhh, we wanna hear this dialogue\\").<br />To be honest with you, these aren't the kind of movies that are a whole lotta fun to watch by yourself, so here's what you do, or at least here's what I do: First I getta bunch'a my homeboys to come over some night, then I throw a few fine females into the mix too, preferrably some trill ones so maybe they'd enjoy the flick too, I try an' plan it around some dark an' rainy weather, then I break out the liquor, sit back, an' jus' enjoy the weird satanic chants, demonic zombies, and the gallons an' gallons'a blood that's shed.  Thas' all there is to it, y'all.

B00005RY7X|4.0|after listening to this album, you're left asking yourself... what the hell?  how could you possibly classify this?  it sounds like nothing else.  it's... uh, hair metal, played with lots of synth, only, much more up to date, and heavier.  and... HAPPY?!  this is one odd duck.  yes, many of the songs sound the same, but if you like it, you won't care.  andrew w.k. sort of proves a first-time point-  it's okay to bash the hell out of everything, and be HAPPY about it.  it's pretty weird.  and certainly not &quot;cool&quot; by any means... but everyone has a different definition of that.  either you're going to like this, or you're going to hate it.  yes, it's a parody.  yes, it's okay to like this.  <BR> <BR>listen to the samples.  if you like what you hear, get the record and you'll love it.  if you don't... listen to some RAMMSTEIN.
B00006V9A0|4.0|After Six years of silence, finally Nirvana gets their just do with a Greatest Hits Album. First and Foremost, this CD is worth the one new unreleased track &quot;You Know You're Right&quot;, perhaps one of Nirvanas best songs ever(that has been hidin' for so many years). <BR>       The only main default about this Albums is that it's missing a few of Nirvana's best songs like &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Drain You&quot;, &quot;Anuerysm&quot; and &quot;Jesus Doesn't Want Me As A Sunbeam&quot;.<BR>       All and all this is a must for anyone who respected what Nirvana done to music, and respected the fact that they changed music forever.
B00003CY6M|3.0|The belief in destiny is central to the plot of this movie. It is mix of &quot;Fools rush in&quot;, &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; and &quot;When Harry met Sally&quot;.<br />Destiny brings Jonathan (John Cusack) and Sara (Kate Beckinsale) to Bloomingdale's and they reach out for the same last pair of gloves. It starts a series of events that end happily several years later. That fateful evening they spend some time together- in the coffee shop, skating and looking at stars. Sara strong belief in destiny separates even though they both enjoy and feel strongly attracted to each other. Sara writes her name and phone number in a book and promises to sell it to a bookshop. She has Jonathan write his name and number on a five-dollar bill and buys mints with it. If, she reasons, fate has destined for them to be together, they will find each other's name and number. Flash forward a couple of years. Jonathan has met Hally (Bridget Moynahan) and is about to marry her. Sara has met Lars (John Corbett) and is engaged to him. But the memories of that magical night with each other are too wonderful to forget. A series of signs and the inevitability of marriage make Jonathan try to influence the destiny. In the meantime (coincidentally) Sara too sets out to search for Jonathan. What follows is a series of near misses that can sometimes test the limits of your patience. Eventually, as expected, the couple does meet and (obviously) dump their respective betrothed.<br />The fact that the series of coincidences sometimes seem implausible or that the plot of the film is not innovative does not take away anything from the charm of the film. This entertaining movie is a definite date-flick. But the viewers will have to shutdown their logic processors before they really start enjoying this movie. All in all, a highly watchable flick that will leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling. This movie is highly recommended to hopeless romantics, destiny-believers and those just looking to spend a relaxed evening with their significant other.
B00005QCVY|5.0|The movie It's A Wonderful Life is one of a very few classics fills which can fill a theater even when it is shown over fifty years after it was released.

B00005Y7AW|5.0|although i have trouble remembering exactly how i heard about rufus wainwright or why i bought 'poses' with my last 20 at b&amp;n almost a year ago, i now consider it to be an integral part in the &quot;soundtrack of my life.&quot; there are some moments where words are inappropriate--we've all had them--and sometimes music is the best narration. rufus' music is by far the most fitting, particularly for those days when you just want to relax, maybe forget something, and be somewhat alone with your thoughts. it also works wonders on long flights. <br />the songs have a certain maturity, almost a weary quality to them. i picture him with a half-smile, eyes down and head nodding as if to say: &quot;yes, yes, i know--i've been there too.&quot; (one gets the impression that he's had just a little too much of southern california--frankly, if you've been, you'll probably empathize.) his songs seem to come from a place not only of understanding, but also from this odd sort of compassion. his perspective seems so finely honed that one wonders just what exactly his experience in life has been. wonder with caution: it is much nicer to be led to odd dark places than to lead yourself--with a guide it's easier to find your way back. rufus wainwright is a poet, not just a musician. he manages to stir something out of everybody.<br />to make an actual qualitative statement, i have recommended this cd to eight of my friends--all with varied taste in music--and so far seven of the eight have actually purchased it legit. <br />of course the quality of music is almost entirely dependent on the opinion of the listener, but give it a fighting chance if you haven't already. music like this takes time to grow on you--it lulls you in with its simplicity, and then bowls you over with its depth. trust me--my opinion counts for everything.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I love this movie. I would have bought the DVD even if it only had the movie on it, with few extras. But I find it truly disappointing that they include tons of non-movie related stuff. The videos are nice. The comic art gallery is nice. BUT WE ALL KNOW THEY RESHOT THE ENDING TO REPLACE THE WORLD TRADE CENTER FINALE. That's the &quot;out-take&quot; I want to see. And even as it is, the out-takes and gags they do include are pretty weak... So I give it three stars for basically being a glorified commercial for the comic book. DVDs are supposed to be about the MOVIE, stupid.
0140177396|4.0|I am in 9th grade and I am 15 years old, but there is something you do not know about me. I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone. The themes are as thick as crunchy peanutbutter.
B00005JKCH|5.0|An excellent effort. The 2-disc set is chock full of extras and even without a home theater system, the discs will still play smoothly and loudly. <br />Cast is great. Maguire, Dunst, Dafoe all played their roles magnificiently. You'd feel sympathy for Dafoe's brilliant potrayal of a man with a split personality. But in the end, its either him or Spidey...so bye-bye Goblin. Kirsten Durnst is sadly only used as eye candy and for the typical 'damsel in distress' scenes. Hopefully a stronger MJ Watson role will be written for her in the sequel. JK Simmons was not used fully in his Jonah Jameson role. Thats an oversight that should be addressed in the sequel as well.<br />Many scenes in the movie were adapted straight from the Amazing Spider-Man comics and Amazing Fantasy #15 and fans should be able to recognise them.<br />Geeks rule (including those without the abilities of a spider)!
0440539811|5.0|This has to be one the greatest book ever written. I do not say this lightly. This book breathes with life energy. The secrects of the universe hide in these pages. Robert Anton Wilson is a genius of the first order. He takes you on a trip that never stops even after reading the book. You see worlds within worlds, reality limited only by the imagination. I have ventured to read this work several times and will probably read it several more times, and each time I do I see something new in it. This story, to me, is the culmination of a literary philosophy of physics. The idea that we live in a universe with endless alternate realities, that perception can not be trapped by in an either/or scenario. The idea of this multiverse can be seen expertly in several other great tomes as well. Both Michael Moorcock's Cornelius Chronicles and Brian Talbot's Adventures Of Luther Arkwright. However, one can not deny the level of unrelenting unreality or reality in Wilson's book. He takes their concepts to the nth degree. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in all the possibilities. If this book showed me anything, it was that there is no limit to those possibilities.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I feel sorry for anyone who is not willing to turn their radio dial to another station at least once a week.  If I hadn't stopped listening to the same redundant tracks of music on a local pop rock station, I would have never stumbled upon Norah. I turned my dial to a jazz station and that's how I heard &quot;Come Away with Me&quot;. 20 years from now, Norah will probably be compared to what Ella Fitzgerald and Aretha Franklin were back in their day.  But you will soon realize after listening through the entire CD that Norah is not just jazz.  She is blues, soul, RandB, and maybe a little bit of country western.  She is, as another reviewer put it so well, a chameleon.  This CD is definately a must buy.
B00006IUL7|2.0|This movie stunk......It could of been done without the superstar talent and it probably would have been more enjoyable.  These actors did anything but the memorable job that garnished all of their individual accolades in the past.  I do not blame the actors themselves, they were restrained by the bad plot, and average direction by a great talent.  Nothing about this movie stood out except for the bland taste left in your mouth when the movie ends.  I have not been this disappointed since I lost 2 hours of my life viewing &quot;The Pledge&quot;.

B00003XACV|4.0|Thomas Newman is without a doubt one of the most creative composers in film today. His scores always have a wide variety of instruments you've probably never heard of and his melodies are always creative and fun to listen to. Here are some of the instruments used in this one: tablas, kim-kim drums, bird calls, mandolas, Appalachian dulcimers, lap steel guitars, ukuleles, arpeggiated violins, detuned mandolins, and a saz. Can anyone tell me what a saz is? &quot;Dead Already&quot; and &quot;Still Dead&quot; are 2 great cues which contain cool sounds and musical effects with a rhythmic beat. Metallic percussion is the highlight of &quot;Root Beer&quot;, &quot;Spartanette&quot;, and &quot;Choking the Bishop&quot;. &quot;Root Beer&quot; contains a sound that sounds like something you would hear walking in a dentist's office along with a bird chirping. Softer, piano sequences are found in &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;Structure &amp; Discipline&quot;, &quot;Mental Boy&quot;, and &quot;Angela Undress&quot;. Another track worth mentioning is &quot;Lunch with the King&quot; which is fun and enjoyable. Overall, an enjoyable score and I always look forward to Newman's works in the future.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I have found that this seems to be a highly misunderstood film. People seem to either love it or absolutely revile it. This film seems unpopular because it makes people look at a part of themselves that they do not want to see, and that is the hypocricy and fear of freedom that hides in all of us. This film is unabashed about its intent. It is a wake up call do in the only way people pay any attention anymore. A SHORT SHARP SHOCK!!! This film brilliantly expresses one possible path a person can take on the road to liberation. The need to create a new self and in turn destroy the old self. We see the two extremes of personality and their ultimate breakdown. The struggle to find the balance in the yin and yang of existence. The darwinian struggle of evelution. Evolve or die!

B00003W8NM|5.0|When this movie first hits you its not in the form of a fight- but rather, the psychological aspects of it that make your mind flutter throughout the movie. Brad and Edward's performances cap off the incredible symbolic and idealistics that set this movie apart from others. Don't watch this one with your mom, but make sure you do, if only for better mental health.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|REQUIEM FOR A DREAM is disturbing, strange, emotionally riveting, and ultimately devasting.  All of those adjectives would seem like a redlight to NOT view this film, but the brilliance of this creation by Darren Aronofsky after Hubert Selby, Jr.'s book does what few films do - it makes a gut-wrenching learning experience.  From the hardcore heroin addiction to the even more terrifying addiction to doctor-prescribed \\"medication\\" drugs we are shown the gamut of how cruel this disease of addiction is to the victi's body, to loved ones, to the world.  The performances by each of the cast members are superb - Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and Marlon Wayans - and the supporting cast (especially the elderly friends of Burstyn's 'Sara')is very strong. But is is the directorial decision to use split screen techniques, rapid motion repetions of popping pills or preparing to shoot up and the middle-of-the-target musical score tha makes this film alomost unbearably real.  A terrifying movie that should be recommended viewing for everyone to get a take on the drug problem this country faces.
B000063CPL|4.0|***I needed to edit this review, as I was wrong about my earlier statings about Dickinson`s vocals. They are top notch.***<br />Nothing better than showing off a band in action, than releasing a double-cd with a live concert to a hungry fan. I was pretty much in awe over this album, and bought it as soon as I found it. But why 4 stars from a Maidenlover?<br /><BR>On to the record!<BR>The band is really great. They play a bit more rough than on their studioalbums, aiming for a more living, tough music. This is not a negative thing! It can be a bit to blurry though.<BR>I think the quality of the sound is the negative thing here, to say this is good quality is not quite right. But what can you do with Rio concerts, being one of the biggest in the world? Still good job. The band does a god job, they are obviously not trying to relax and play so-so. They play fast, they play furious, they play great. Nicko should always be hailed, being the master of the drums even when the tempo speeds up. Harris is master of the bass, nothing else comes close. Then we got the guitarists, they do a amazing job ripping thru the riffs and songs like we know them to.<BR>Bruce..I have enjoyed his singing thru the years, he is one of the best vocalists in the world of Heavy Metal. We can hear him try and he does what he can, but the overwelding sound can make him sound more skinny and low. I am sure this is just something on this record, For it must be hard to sing louder than 3 roaring guitars including one of the worlds best bassists and a awesome drummer.<BR>The song selection, is very good, but why on Rio did they drop songs from Somewhere in Time? Wasted years would have been perfect here! Otherwise, they do a really neat job playing their new songs to great success for the audience. Most other bands keep it safe and plays the good old ones, but Maiden shows us that in time, Brave New World will be a new classic, and that they are proud of Brave New World.<BR>They should be proud over Rock in Rio too, for it really is a great live-album, with some minor flaws with blurry sound(too hard to avoid at this size) and a bit weak Bruce. It is really a 5`er, but those two things is the only thing that prevents it. The concert and their performance it self is a pure 5`er...and even a 6`er.
0345448898|1.0|These books were torture to read.  I got through the first one and hoped that the second might pick up and be better.  Wrong!

B00000099Y|5.0|I don't care who you are-anyone who appreciates and understands music will find that Tool's Aenima is one of the most meticulously crafted masterpieces of the 90's. Maynard completely outdoes himself on this one, spewing heart-felt lyrics as though they were needed to save his life. The melodic riffs and headbanging metal make this one of those must-haves, even for fans of different genres. This is not an album you listen to, it's an album you experience.
B00005YW4H|3.0|This is a good debut recording by Jones.  It's listenable and impressive for someone so young.  Her high, soft, smooth voice is not going to knock your socks off, but it's still nice.  To me, she comes across as a pop singer doing slow jazz tunes.  But that may be because of her age.  My favorite song is probably the title track.  I bought this when it was initially released at under 10 bucks.  Once it became popular retailers  jacked up the price.  It's not a must-have, but still worth a listen.
0812550706|4.0|Conflict in Ender's Game<BR> The book Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is successful because of its use of conflict throughout the story.  In a site conflict is described as when the protagonist is opposed by some person or force in the play.  There are 5 types of conflict:  man vs. man, man vs. himself, man vs. fate, man vs. nature, and man vs. society.  In Ender's Game the conflicts of man vs. man and man vs. society is used.  Throughout the story Ender faces many problems of conflict and the conflicts are what makes this book so successful and fun to read.<BR> One type of conflict that Orson Scott has Ender faces is man vs. man.  Orson uses this literary device to help the book succeed by having the protagonist, Ender, have an antagonist who is brought out in his brother Peter and one of the kids Ender is with, Bernard.  The conflict with Ender's brother Peter is helpful for the book because it causes chaos in Ender's life.  Another reason why this conflict is helpful for the book is it makes the reader not want to book down.  Something could happen with Ender and his brother at any moment.<BR> The other conflict Orson Scott Card uses to help make Ender's game successful is man vs. society.  This is another part to help the book have the readers not wanting to put it down.  The kids that Ender is with do not take well to liking him at first.  It takes awhile for him to make friends, especially when he goes around breaking their arms like he did with Bernard.  Orson Scott also uses this conflict well because it seems like all the time Ender has some type of problem with someone.<BR> The use of conflict throughout the story Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card makes it successful.  There is non stop conflict which helps the action throughout the story.
B00000JCOV|2.0|Slipknot: the newest, most popular, and so far most mainstream addition to the death metal category yet. It's too bad that they just aren't good at what they do, otherwise they'd be helping out a genre that usually demands intensity, power, sometimes speed, and always talent. The boys in Slipknot may be able to play their instruments fast, but playing in time signatures which register at blinding speeds does not necessarily mean they have any talent or belong with the rest of the hard-working metal genre. Creativity, diversity, and talent are also necessary in order to create good speed metal that will actually register with the listener as something they'll remember, which obviously didn't work this time around. Not to mention the fact that the lyrics should be a bit more meaningful than the drivel Corey Taylor spits out all over this recording.<br />A select few of the members could probably use their instruments well if placed in another band that had more of a musical vision, more integrity, and other talented musicians to surround themselves with. Joey Jordison happens to be a great drummer with a niche for speed, but lacks diversity as he constantly repeats the same fills and rolls across his set at the same constant pace, on virtually every track on the album. As you can probably guess, this gets more than a little repetetive. Corey Taylor's vocals carry an impressive scream, but limits his range drastically as he shows that screaming is all he really has to offer, breaking into rap or monotonous singing when hes not hollering at the top of his lungs. Other than that the other band members are pretty dispensable, with the two additional percussionists who are hardly, if ever, heard on the entire record, the DJ who scratches about 5 times throughout the course of all 14 tracks, and the sampler who is probably less of a band member of Slipknot than the last person to read this review, and I'm not exaggerating. He really does nothing. The bassist is barely hearddue to the ultra-low tuning of the guitars, and the two guitarists hammer out simple, repetitive riffs which consist of nothing but power chords and show no real rhythm structure, leaving it all up to the drums and non-existant bass.<br />In addition to all those short-comings, Corey's lyrics are like a snowball, becoming increasingly irritating the more you listen to the album. His constant rants which seem complex at a first glance and over-use of the \\"f word\\" really all break down into \\"my life sucks\\", a motto which has already been thrown around by far too many bands in this day and age. It is obvious through his constant obsession with screaming how much he hates himself that he really has no desire to fix any of the problems he seems to be trying to address. If the lyrics aren't saying how much he hates the world, they're completely undecipherable and meaningless. After all, what is \\"You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes?\\" supposed to translate to? Pity that so many listeners find refuge with this nonsense. It's also notable that the lyrics as well as the bands purpose in wearing masks are completely hypocritical. The purpose is supposed to make the fans listen to the music without worrying about the bands image or looks, yet now the masks have become their image and they plaster photos of themselves clad in their uniforms all over the liner notes.<br />Now that I've used up three paragraphs, I think I'll sum it all up with three words: boring, repetitive, uninspiring. There are so many bands out there which have huge amounts of talent compared to Slipknot, in all aspects. Mushroomhead, which many people view as a rip-off of Slipknot, has far more talent than this band. If you want a singer who can scream as well as sing, look no further than Maynard James Keenan of Tool or Mike Patton of Faith No More and Tomahawk. If you want just a straight-forward metal vocalist, check out Dani Filth or Devon Townsend. For more complex guitar work than this get some Black Sabbath or Pantera. For an exceptional bass player look into Mudvayne or the Deftones. To find a talented drummer with diversity get some records buy Strapping Young Lad, Anthrax, or Spineshank. And for samples and sound effects, Videodrone is your best bet. I've named numerous alternatives to Slipknot's bunch of noise, so there's no excuse to look into this at all. Although I'm sure this review will be censored, I would suggest clicking Yes if you support metal with more meaning than Slipknot, and No if you like your metal juvenile, redundant, and pointless. Thanks for reading.
0446310786|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee tackles the moral and realistic views of racism in the story of a girl and her small southern town.  Set in Maycomb, Alabama, during the 1930s, the book vividly depicts the issue of race and how a young girl overcomes the boundaries of color to show her community that there is more to someone than the color of their skin.  Scout, the main character, lives with her brother Jem and father, whom she calls Atticus.  Atticus teaches her and Jem that race really means nothing and that every person deserves the chance to be respected and treated fairly.  Atticus is completely non-violent and will not even show the children how to fire a weapon.  The family's black cook Calprunia tells the children to never kill a mockingbird, because they are only here to sing. <BR> During the summer Scout and Jem befriend a boy named Dill who becomes fascinated with an almost \\"haunted\\" house owned by Boo Radley.  The children begin to trespass on the mysterious property and soon find little gifts left in a knot in one of the trees.  They are shot at by Boo's father and in the chaotic events Jem loses his pants.  He finds them days later mended lying on the fence.  The children come to believe that Boo is behind all this confusion.<BR>Meanwhile, Atticus is assigned to a case involving a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus tells his children that they might be taunted and treated unfairly because he was taking the case.  The children take the criticism openly and even spend Christmas in a black community and become friends with everyone there.  They attend a mass with Calprunia and become more comfortable with the open and accepting black community there. Sadly, Tom Robinson is found guilty by a racist, unfairly picked jury, even though Atticus proved that Tom did not rape the woman.  While in prison an angry mob wants to kill Tom. Acting quickly and effectively Scout talks the huge crowd of adults into notkilling him and letting the whole fiasco go.  Imagine seeing a six year old talking a monstrous crowd out of killing an innocent man, whom she does not even, really know.<BR>The father of the \\"raped\\" girl attacks Jem and Scout, but Boo is mysteriously there to help them and ends up killing the crazed man.  Scout and Jem realize that Boo, even though different from them, is a truly caring and a good person.<BR> Harper Lee relates that the Mockingbird symbolizes innocence, which includes Tom Robinson, Jem, and Boo Radley.  These innocent characters have lost something or been almost destroyed by others. Needing help they unknowingly turn to Scout to recover what they have lost.  Lee also reveals that race can be conquered by even a six year old girl like Scout.  Scout shows the angry mob that what they are doing is wrong and is completely unnecessary, telling them they must treat everyone with respect.  Lee also depicts the morals of a small southern town, by the hate and racists beliefs that fill almost everyone's minds.   Through Scout, Harper Lee shows that the innocence of a child can overcome the terrible boundaries of race.  Harper Lee wrote a meaningful and symbolic story revealing that race is ultimately nothing and that every human should treat all of mankind with the respect that everyone deserves.  This is an outstanding novel that should be required reading for any child or adult. This novel can truly change the way you think about life and your fellow man.
0446605409|4.0|I'm glad I read this.  It was my first Demille book and won't be my last.  I've already started The Gold Coast, and so far I like it even more.<br />This is a story told by an NYPD detective who is recouperating from bullet wounds in one of the ritzy areas of Long Island.  It involves murder, buried treasure, love (or perhaps more accurately, lust), greed, and biological warfare agents.  Demille's use of dialog and voice of narration is great.  It was so refreshing to read this after trudging through a Clancy novel.  He must average two wisecracks a page.  And I found all of them to be funny.  That's probably why I like his writing style so much.  Maybe it's not for everybody.  I have a feeling there's more than a few women would get a little steamed by some of his remarks.  <br />This isn't a short read and there's not always a lot of action, but the story and writing style make it a page turner.  Demille is now one of my favorites and I look forward to reading more of his work.
B00006NSZ5|5.0|TO me Eminem is one of the tightest singers.Just for one day i would like to meet him.I have all of his CD's.Some songs in his CD's are slow but its all good.I just cant wait untill his 8 Mile movie comes out in theaters this friday.When I go and see the movie I think its going to be bad as hell.To me I think he is one of the best singers.
B00005JL2O|3.0|Ok, ok, I admit it. I laughed. Out loud and uncontrollably at parts. But the in between was very regrettable. The creators seemed to trip over their own feet to try and get all the inuendos in. And there are a few times where I couldn't help but feel like saying 'Ok you did that joke in the last two movies, c'mon now. Lets move things along. (see the fountain scene.)<BR>   Lets see they did the 60's twice and now on the the 70's, what does this mean we should be prepared for Austin to go back to the 80's in a Terminator-like plot twist to try and stop Scott from ever being bored? Oh I'm getting ahead of myself, and giving away key plot points.<BR>   In fairness, I did laugh, til my face hurt. Dr. Evil's rap was simply too much, and I loved the way Britney made fun of herself at the end. The jokes that were funny were very funny The mere thought of Michael Caine being in it was funny. After you saw the movie poster, it was all down hill from there. The Celebrity cameo's were pretty funny. I mean c'mon Tom Cruise and Gwenyth, no one saw that coming. <BR>   This is a very successful conclusion to the trilogy, not that they didn't obviously leave it open for a fourth installment. It will make you laugh but overall I got the feeling like the sun was settting.
B000000OQF|5.0|This cd may just be the ultimate album of all time...this cd is up there with Metallica's Black Album and every song is just amazing.
B00003CXDG|1.0|Let me first say that I thoroughly enjoyed Mission Impossible.  I thought it did a great job of entertaining, even with some of its absurdities.  I liked Face/Off.  I loved The Matrix.  But this, Woo-eee, was so blatantly ridiculous!  The stupid face masks that everyone just happened to have at just the right time.  It might have been okay one or two times, but ad absurdum?  The Nissan Pathfinder, loaded with the thugs, that could catch and keep up with a pocket-rocket sport bike.  I mean, come on... It was unbearable.  Speaking of bears, how about when Cruise and his nemesis were on their sport bikes and came flying at each other, jump in the air, slam into each in a big bear hug, and fall to the ground ready to get up and Matrix each other.  This movie was unbelievably stupid.  I enjoy a good action movie as much as the next guy, but this was so poorly done it almost hurt to watch it.  Woo's Face/Off had silly violence too but it was much better that this.  Any entertainment value was lost on it's absurdity.  It was so bad that it wasn't even humorously bad.  Don't waste your time or money.  Ugh, I can't believe I spent the time thinking about it to write this.
B00006F7S4|2.0|Once again Beck adopts a different musical style - and again, he produces a listless group of songs that others have done far better.  Why this guy continues to get the press he does is beyond me - the problem with critics is that they confuse experimentation with outstanding music.  Beck's albums don't wear well - this one might sit in your CD player for perhaps a few weeks and then collect dust on your shelf.  If you want to hear a singer songwriter with intelligent lyrics, strong melodies and outstanding vocals try Rhett Miller or Aimee Mann.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Let's face it:<BR>  Atlantis, Mulan, Hunchback, etc. With the exception of the Lion King and maybe Aladdin, Disney has been a ruthless money grubbing machine who doesn't turn out movies worth a 7 dollar ticket, and would make Walt himself stop from spinning in his grave and wonder what the hell are they attaching his name to.<BR>  However there was a time when things were different. The words 'Once upon a time' were always concluded with  'Happily ever after' And everything didn't have to have a sequel. Beauty and the Beast was the high point of that renaissance. <BR>   Classic characters and wonderful music composition make this the best movie disney has ever put out. Perfectly adapted from classic literature and put into big screen form, this movie was the only animated feature ever nominated for best picture; and well worth nominating.<BR>   Its release on DVD is both a blessing and a curse with Disney holding off on its main titles in order to strike up huge demand. The DVD itself does the movie justice by allowing you to pick the version of the movie you want to see. The one you fell in love with years ago, or the one they obviously tried to make even more money off of earlier in the year at IMAX. (that should tell you which one I watch.)<BR>   This is one of my favorite movies ever. Partially because of how I first saw it, but its perfect for everyone old and young.
B00006IU73|5.0|This is one of the rare, pure circular tablets of genius to ever come out in the past years. Beautiful prog instrumentation with dark lyrics from an unknown gem. What more could you (or I at least) ask for? Listen to &quot;Heartattack in a Lay-By&quot;, that song tore my heart out, it was that powerful.<br />Don't let the cardboard wrapping fool you.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This HBO miniseries portrayal of Easy Company, 506th regiment, 101st Airborne, pays the hightest tribute to the men who served from the Normandy invasion to Hitler's Eagle's Nest.  These elite paratroopers were among the best that the United States was coerced into using in order to stop Hitler's war machine.  This DVD collection will allow you to traverse with them through the great trials that these men faced on their journey to becoming heroes.  This collection is quite simply the greatest war epic ever.
B00005OAIE|4.0|I love this one.  John's ... baritone and acoustic sound is great to listen to and fun to sing along with particularly when the waves are full enough with angst.  ...
0440213525|5.0|I think this book is incredibly vibrant and everybody who likes suspense should definitely read this. John Grisham is definitely at his best. This is by far the best book he has put out. This high suspense book is based on a horrible suicide that will haunt Mark and Danny Sway for the rest of their lives. And the worst part about it is that Mark (the older brother) has been lying to the cops the whole time. He wonders if he should tell the cops because his little brother is traumatized from the whole suicide. Now he is taking on the state, Mafia, and even the FBI. And the killer won't let the secret get out no matter what, and that includes killing Mark!
0446530573|3.0|From Frankie Frog Eye's \\"Organized Cooking\\": ...Okay, so at this point in checking things out, I'm sure you realize that I'm very worried about reading the recipes, right? Right. So I put the book down for a while, take a few glasses of Brioschi and try to think about something else. The first thing that comes into my mind is the time I put my glasses on my ten-month-old nephew Rosario and he screwed up his face like the world had gone haywire and crawled into a wall. I almost bust a gut, but I think you had to be there.<BR>So I start to read some of the recipes: Marinara Sauce, Sunday Gravy, Linguine con Vongole, Pizza, Pork Chops with the Vinegar Peppers. Basic stuff. But guess what? The recipes are all pretty accurate! There are even one or two made exactly the way I make mine! Thank goodness for Michele Scicolone and her recipes!...
B000065U1N|5.0|A real look into what it was to serve your country and protect the man beside you when the stuff hits the fan.  GREAT MOVIE!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Awesome movie, george lucas has really out done himself this time
0385484518|3.0|The fact that it is a real story makes it absolutely beautiful. It touches your heart just like Mitch touched his Coach's heart.It also reminded me of The Prophet with its universal message of love, humanity and death.<br />It is such a nice feeling to go back and pick up where you left off. As the professor said .. not everyone gets this chance. It makes you realize how short life is .. how precious everyday thing is .. waking up to the birds singing .. rain .. sunshine. Life takes us within its circles without a deep breath to take and relax .. running after success and money ...forgetting our friends and crushing our emotions ..<br />Albom narrates his story and describes his relationship with his teacher, and shifts from the present to the past, and then you go with him and visit his teacher again... without feeling the passage of time. He shows his feelings and expresses his fears in a natural subtle way that you quickly identify with him and know exactly what he is talking about.<br />I truly enjoyed it.
0316666343|5.0|Don't let the fact that you heard it is about a murder turn you off to this splendid book.  It is not about the murder.  A very good story is told from view of the victim who is safe and sound in heaven.  The Lovely Bones is a book that is \\"different\\" in a very good way.
0812550706|5.0|Imagery is defined as the use of vivid or figurative language to represent objects, actions, or ideas.  In Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card, Card does an exceptional job of not displaying any imagery.  <br />Throughout the novel, Card does not use any imagery when he is describing different parts of the novel.  For example when he explains  what the battle room is and made of, he conveys the minimal amount of description to depict the battle room. On page 89, the inside of the battleroom is clarified by Ender  \\"The battleroom was different, too.  Huge brown boxes were suspended in midair, partially obstructing the view. So these were the obstacles that the soldiers called stars.\\"  When Ender fights Bonzo in the bathroom, Card does not use elaborate words to describe this event.  For example on page 211 when they begin to fight, Card states the least amount detail.  \\"Without seeing him, Ender knew it would bring his face closer, almost in Ender's hair; so instead of kicking, he lunged upward off the floor with the powerful lunge of the soldier bounding from the wall, and jammed his head into Bonzo's face.\\"  Card does explain what is happening, but he could have gone into greater description illustrating this fight.  Another example is when Ender confronts the entire Bugger fleet. On page 292 the enemy is described as \\"The enemy outnumbered him a thousand to one; the simulator glowed green with them.  They were grouped in  a dozen different formations.  Shifting positions, changing shapes, moving in seemingly random patterns through the simulator field.\\"  Card tells how many there are and what they are doing, but does not go into great comparative detail about the fleet.  Although Card lacks great amounts of imagery, this does not take away from the novel, in fact it makes the novel better.  Ender's Game is a action book with constant activity, and if Card were to go into great detail with lots of imagery,  it would make the action go slower and not have as great of an effect.  <BR>The lack of imagery also contributes to the bleak atmosphere of the book.  Ender's life is meant to be without any comfort, softness or happiness.  The focus of the story is that Ender cannot save the world if he has any hope of help from anybody. He is predicted to be the next Mazar Rackham and can only rely on himself to save the Earth from the Buggers.  Card's lack of imagery contributes to the reader getting this impression of solitude and isolation.<br />Although the feeling of this book is bleak, the overall result is positive.  The reader struggles with Ender against the injustices he endures, and, in the end, feels that justice is served.  The lack of imagery contributes to  the greatness of the book.
B000021YQV|5.0|I listen to all types of music, and this is why I think the album \\"Toxicity\\" by the divinely wrathful System Of A Down can be the best album released in the last hundred years, or seems that long...so here are my highly unbiased opinions, hope they are of some assistance..<br />Prison Song - Sounds like Ozzy beginning \\"Crazy Train\\", but a lot faster, more tension, and of course, better voice. Prison Song makes moot points, but regardless of that, it's a great intro that punches in the face right off the bat. The chorus gets a little annoying after a whle, and Daron's lines are sort of dubm, but of course you can turn a deaf ear once in a while. Sort of like the Beatles' Revolution, but standing stronger. 7/10<br />Needles - ... this song is explosive! Great lyrics, great voice, great tempo. I can't help but think they're implying that the gov't implants some sort of device in us that tells us our daily routine, like a control chip. Not a smart plot, but the messages are there, I'm sure of that. Reminds me of Nirvana's \\"Lithium\\", very egoistic, but gives no reason about anything. 8/10<br />Deer Dance - Thundering intro, makes you wanna destroy whatever room you're in. This song's lyrics contain more intelligence than than those of the Hives'and the Vines'lyrics, of their whole CD's!! Listen and judge for yourself. It kinda [is bad] when it slows down, but hey, the fact that this song actually requires a brain for it to be heard, makes it better. Very political, somewhat controversial, but yeah, cool song. 6/10<br />Jet Pilot - \\"Wired were the eyes of a horse on a jet pilot, one that smiled when he flew over the bay.\\" Don't know, I'm wondering what the ... they mean too. But cool tempo song, goes really fast, with those lyrics, then slows down to more incomprehensible poetry, then increasingly fast again. Lyrics should remind you of RHCP's \\"Scar Tissue\\", same topic, if under any classification at all, but Serj's lyrics are too advanced. 7/10<br />X - This song is System Of A Down's attempt to tell us that we are overpopulated. In my opinion, they're wrong. Still very thought-provoking, but, gives no reasons to anything. Very short, and, yes, still more entertaining than the White Stripes. Serj contradicts himself, saying \\"we don't need to multiply\\", then later, \\"we don't need to nullify\\", but, asking the people to stop reproducing is nullifying. Unless he thinks more people means more killing, but, you know, this confusion can be avoided if they post something on their web site at least. Above average song in the end. But remember, above average in the best CD of the last hundred years is still better than any other song from any other artist. ... 6/10<br />Chop Suey! - Needs no description. Best song in the CD. Come on, admit it, when compared to John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", of course we can argue about their opinions, but, come on, content, and tempo, and lyrical play, and everything, this song is uncomparable!!! 10/10<br />Bounce - Funny song, sounds like some 15 year old kid wrote this, but still explosive and catchy, and will surely make you bang your head into your stereo. 6/10<br />Forest - Confusing song. Track number 8, also, H is the 8 letter of the alphabet. H for Hitler, and, by way of God, this may be telling someone that he is Hitler's reincarnation, to look around, and see the results. Listen, you'll hear the message too. \\"Why can't you see that you are, my, child.\\" Because, I'm pretty sure Serj isn't talking to a long lost baby he had with some [woman]. Guitars are dope in this song. 8/10<br />ATWA - Supposedly about Charles Manson...hmmm, I don't see, but, maybe the message is embedded in the seemingly, love-like lyrics. Not too catchy, still with more melody and better lyrically and energetically than mostof what Smashing Pumpkins made. 6/10<br />Science - Mediocre song. Great intro, but the chorus just gets annoying. Plus, their arguments here are unfounded. Still has some wisdom, something that Puff Daddy can't claim to have, and sometimes the lyrics get stuck in your head. 6/10<br />Shimmy - Raw song, very very dope. Intro is very cool. They must be talking about the public school system. I think they complain too much, if they dislike this country so much, why don't they leave. \\"Oh our economy exploits world resources...ok gotta go, drive around in my Ferrari and watch my big screen TV, made in Japan. And to answer your question, I will NOT try to change U.S. foreign policy the only possible way, through legislative parties, I'll just continue to [complain] about it here while plucking strings.\\" But, overall,faster than anything Led Zeppelin ever made. 7/10<br />Toxicity - Starts slow, with a the same kind of string picking that we hear in Chop Suey. Lyrics are great, and beat is excellent. They claim to \\"shine light upon our hearts\\", umm, if so, I think it's only musically. If otherwise, they haven't proven it. But, they play it on the radio for a reason, it's a [good] song. 9/10<br />Psycho - Starts off too, Satanically, for lack of a better word. And lyrics are boring and lack cohesion. They fail to have a catchy phrase, anywhere in this song, but their guitars kinda make up for it. If this track were to be in the Beatles 1, it wouldn't be anywhere near the worst. So it's good song, probably the best song on this CD to fall asleep to, the guitar near the end makes you sleepy. See for yourself. Just for being a hard rock song that you can still meditate too, it's a 7/10<br />Aerials - Very philosophical song. Gives hints of Socialism. Jean-Jacque Rousseau would agree with them here. Some lyrics don't make sense, as what we would normally do sometimes in certain situations is viewed wrong in the lyrics of this song. They should have Psycho as the ending track, not this one. Still, great guitar riffs, and, little playing around with flutes and other stuff at the end is imitating what the Beatles did after \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\". Great song, video is stupid though. Sorry Shavo. 8/10<br />Remember, just because I think some tracks are not perfect tens, that doesn't mean it should effect the overall rating for the whole CD of 5 out of 5. You'll, see, get the CD, it's a gift from God. ... Overall, the best CD out there right now. ... System Of A Down ROCKS!!!!!!!!
B00005YU1O|5.0|Absolutely amazing accomplishment--touches on many different philosophical perspectives on life, death, dreaming, and consciousness in the most visually stunning movie that I have ever seen.  The rotoscoping technology where the animators &quot;paint&quot; over top of the fully-editted, live-action movie make it impossible to take your eyes off the screen even if you do not like or agree with the ideas being presented.  Every frame is a work of art, and the extras on the DVD are a must to fully appreciate the scope of this project.
630441403X|5.0|Two lost souls.<br />LEAVING LAS VEGAS is a tragedy from the very first frame--a tragedy surrounding two people drowning in the depths of despair.  Suddenly thrown together in Las Vegas, a perfect setting for the decadence of their lives, these two haunting characters find love, a love as flawed as their turbulent existence, but a meaningful love just the same.<br />Nicolas Cage deserved the Oscar he won for his depiction of an alcoholic determined to kill himself while looking through the bottom of a bottle; Elisabeth Shue should have won an Oscar for her portrayal of a lonely, hard-luck hooker.  LEAVING LAS VEGAS is raw, brutal, and gutwrenching, yet poignant enough to allow the viewer to sincerely care about the two tragic characters.<br />Look elsewhere if you're wanting a drama with a positive message or resolution.  Higly recommended for those who wish to be challenged by a gritty, disturbing story that pulls no punches and holds nothing back.  LEAVING LAS VEGAS is an exceptional film.
B00006JIA4|5.0|What an incredible voice Freddie Mercury had and Brian May's guitar leaves you speechless. Yes Disc 1&amp;2 are the best of the three however disc three is still worth owning.This band really was cut short when Mercury died of aids at an early age for I believe they would still be making incredible pop/rock today.If you don't own any Queen cd's then this is the set to buy because you get an amazing collection of songs for a great price.
B000002UKS|5.0|This could be one of my favorite CDs.  Unlike most CDs, it doesnt get old.  Monkey Wrench is my first love on this CD, but the others are great too.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I bought this CD a week ago, and have been listening to it constantly. One thing I love about this band is the lyrics, because they're original and truly inspiring. I think that Kurt was a very gifted musician and a genius songwriter. So any Nirvana fans out there must get their greatest hits, which even includes the latest &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; which I personally love! It's an explosive album that covers just about every aspect of human nature. 5 stars.
0812550706|4.0|In Ender's Game Orson Scott Card uses the literary term foil, many times though out the novel.  The literary term foil, helps strengthen the novel.  This is because of how Scott, uses it to compare and contrast all of the different characters.  One of those instants of foil is Ender and Peter.  Another foil found, is Valentine and Peter.  The last foil is Ender basically against most of his battle school.   These three foils show how different people contrast in the novel.<BR>          The first time that foil is shown in the novel is Peter against Ender.  Peter is the older brother of Ender and constantly bully's and treats Ender as if he is nothing.  Ender takes all of the things Peter does to him, but in his head he wishes Peter would die.  The reason Ender thinks this is because Peter tells him that he will kill him if Ender doesn't do something for him.  Finally, when Enders rage all finally comes out, he takes it out on a school bully and not Peter.  Even after this Peter still bullies and treats Ender bad.  <BR>           The second foil found in Ender's Game is Valentine and Peter.  Valentine is the middle child in the Wiggin Family and Peter also bully's her in the beginning of the novel.  He treats her the same way in which he treats Ender.  But, after Ender is taking away to Battle School, Peter stops the bullying and starts to get good grades.  Valentine soon figures out that Peter and Ender were almost the same, expect Ender would never act in the way Peter does by bullying.  <BR>           The third foil that is in Ender's Game is Ender against his Battle School. At Battle School Ender is an outsider, because he is new, young, and dose not know what will happen there. Then, to make it worse, Ender helps win a battle and becomes Number 1 on the ratings at Battle School.  This makes all the kids at Battle School despise Ender.  Ender soon finds out that Battle School is not all that great, but he still stays in the top spot of the standings.  This foil shows that if someone is good at something, but someone else is not, you will be despised.<BR>         The foil that Orson Scott Card uses does help in reading his novel Ender's Game.  This is because he uses it to show a different prospective on how life is like when everyone seems like any enemy to you.  Also, Card uses it to bring out different sides to characters, that we don't see usually.  The literary term foil is one that helps create a different tone on the whole novel, which Orson Scott Card does well.
0684800713|5.0|Hemingway's style is a style that makes you want to live.  Whether his characters are diving from caf&eacute; to caf&eacute; in search of a quick buzz or out in the woods fishing, Hemingway takes the reader there with amazing descriptive power.<br />_The Sun Also Rises_ is the story of a group of expatriates centered around the characters Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, and Robert Cohn.  Their desire to live and to experience takes them from the caf&eacute;s of Paris to the bullfights of Pamplona, Spain.  Along the way they love, hate, and betray each other, often as just a way to feel anything at all.<br />Jake is in many ways the typical Hemingway main character.  Jake was a soldier in the Great War who became wounded and fell in love with his nurse, Brett.  We see echoes of this story in A Farewell To Arms and Hemingway's life.  Jake however is physically impotent from his war wounds.  He craves Brett, but she will not have him because of her sexual needs.  While Jake is physically impotent, all of Brett's lovers end up being emotionally impotent, so Jake functions as Brett's one love, with no power to satisfy her: Hemingway's own \\"catch 22.\\"<br />A masterful stroke of Hemingway is his ability to have the environment play out the emotional state of the characters.  This extends well beyond the natural forces mimicking the characters feelings as in the storms of some gothic novel, or The Great Gatsby's conflict on the hottest day of the year; Hemingway uses the whole environment, natural and man-made to play out his dramas.  Jake's only serenity is found in the mountains away from mankind, just fishing. But as the conflict rises the story moves back to civilization to where bull-fights become more and more intense with each day.  The bulls and bullfighters themselves begin to represent various figures of the drama.  The emasculated steer trying to keep the other bulls calm, as Jake seeks peace between his friends.  The bullfighter's elegant grace at dancing with the bulls mirrors Brett's sexual games.<br />The power of Hemingway ultimately lies in his short descriptive prose.  His pithy statements set the scene, set the mood, and then send the reader on into the action.  While the train of thought style that Faulkner and Joyce use would probably better reflect how one thinks in a given situation, Hemingway's use of terse statements gives us the scene in readable understandable chunks that draw us in easier.  It may not be the way we think, but it is the way we understand.<br />The language completely sucks you into the setting.  Many point to Hemingway's and the characters' use of alcohol as their drug of choice, but the true drug of _The Sun Also Rises_ is experience.  Disillusioned by the Great War the expatriate characters shift from moment to moment just wanting to live in that moment, as if it were their last.  So as Jake soaks up the dancing and the drinking, so do we.  As Brett feverishly tries to pray in the church, so do we. We can feel the dust of Spain settle on our necks, and we can feel the cool stream run past our legs.  The jazz music makes us want to dance, and the bullfights make us want to dance with death.  Hemingway's style is not just persuasive, it is compelling.<br />So even as we find ourselves in situations we would normally find appalling-drinking in the morning, faced with a dead man lying in the road-we still find we want to be there.  We want to experience what Jake experiences.  We find that we want to live.rett's sexual games.<br />The power of Hemingway ultimately lies in his short descriptive prose.  His pithy statements set the scene, set the mood, and then send the reader on into the action.  While the train of thought style that Faulkner and Joyce use would probably better reflect how one thinks in a given situation, Hemingway's use of terse statements gives us the scene in readable understandable chunks that draw us in easier.  It may not be the way we think, but it is the way we understand.<br />The language completely sucks you into the setting.  Many point to Hemingway's and the characters' use of alcohol as their drug of choice, but the true drug of _The Sun Also Rises_ is experience.  Disillusioned by the Great War the expatriate characters shift from moment to moment just wanting to live in that moment, as if it were their last.  So as Jake soaks up the dancing and the drinking, so do we.  As Brett feverishly tries to pray in the church, so do we. We can feel the dust of Spain settle on our necks, and we can feel the cool stream run past our legs.  The jazz music makes us want to dance, and the bullfights make us want to dance with death.  Hemingway's style is not just persuasive, it is compelling.<br />So even as we find ourselves in situations we would normally find appalling-drinking in the morning, faced with a dead man lying in the road-we still find we want to be there.  We want to experience what Jake experiences.  We find that we want to live.
B00006JLX4|4.0|If you're just getting into Pavement, and haven't already heard much of the stuff on this disc - buy it. It has some of the best music ever made. For those who have been down the road with the boys, though, and are wary of paying twice for the same songs - your concerns are justfied.<br />On the plus side, the sound quality of the Peel Sessions is better than on the (awesome, near-canonical) \\"Stuff Up the Cracks\\" bootleg. It's great that, at last, there's a legitimate way to own these songs. They're some of Pavement's best ever, and finally they're accessible (and affordable) to everyone. <br />Unfortunately, so much other great stuff remains exclusively on \\"Cracks,\\" including the third Peel Session (from a few years later), that the bootleg will remain mighty tempting to new listeners - which sort of defeats this set's \\"beat the boots\\" purpose. (If you want the tinny live stuff on disc 2, better I guess to get it this way than on \\"Stray Slack.\\") Presumably, the \\"Crooked Rain\\"-era stuff will see official release when THAT album gets the reissue treatment on its 10th anniversary. <br />But this gets to the core of the problem: beyond the profit motive, why bother? What the world needed was a single, excellent Pavement rarities set. The mighty \\"S&E\\" is cheapened (if such a thing is possible) when it's slapped carelessly on a disc with one Peel Session and the few weak tracks from the (must-have) Drag City early years CD. (Just because \\"Mercy Snack\\" and \\"My First Mine\\" are from the \\"Slanted sessions\\" doesn't mean they should show up here.) I don't care how great the LP - it's going to lose its punch when, right after its final note is struck, it's followed up by a reprise of its very first track (in a basically identical \\"7-inch version\\"). Blech!<br />It is cool to have \\"Watery, Domestic,\\" the \\"Trigger Cut\\" b-sides, and the so-so-excellent \\"Greenlander\\" all in a row: new Paveheads are in for a treat. For the rest of us... well, like me, you'll probably buy it anyway. But I bet that when I put on \\"S&E\\" in the future, this won't be the disc I reach for.
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used  (Self-Titled Debut)<br />Regarding the obscure locations that serve as the modern day breeding grounds for most of the Indie scene's Newcomers, It's not surprising that the nation's most concentrated pocket of Mormons could have produced such a volatile cocktail such as Orem, Utah's The Used.<BR>  This firecracker debut disc (as the title of track seven suggests) is in itself \\"A box full of sharp objects\\", if not an impressive arsenal of other assorted infliction devices taking guise in the form of twelve songs that will cut, bludgeon, and beat the point home. The end result of this gentle persuasion leaves the listener/victim unresistingly infected. Whether it be by the Clubbing smash of \\"Say days ago\\" or by the razor sharp allure of \\"Poetic Tragedy\\", (the albums pinnacle height) on which vocalist Bert McCracken projects his voice into haunting abstractions as impressive as any euphoric hallucination.<BR>  Noteworthy mention as well goes to the backing vocals which are brought to us courtesy of  the other ¾'s of The Used crew who also man the instruments. McCracken establishes his presence in this sound by his ability to effectively punctuate the diversity of tones present in the music. According to the needs of the situation,  throaty screams, so guttural in fact, that he's known to actually vomit sometimes while offering up these outbursts, serve as blast re-enforcement to the punchy rhythm section, and cathartic wailing that showcase the singer's raw and powerful upper register, flow seamlessly from breathe to breathe (think Glassjaw, not System of a Down). Through all twelve tracks, regardless of whether it's he's wearing his metal face or the choir boy smile, Bert seems to always be fearlessly confessing all the things you've often muttered under your breathe.<BR>  With the aid of thick and slick studio production, The Used have successfully vaulted the bar that Post-punk Genre-busters have raised thus high and now find themselves to have landed smack in the busy intersection of a rapidly evolving yet inviting mainstream, & a broadening spotlight on Post-hardcore. Hmm, Dangerous streets to be caught in crossway traffic on, but exciting all the same for this new rising band.<BR>   <BR>                                                             Review by: J Young
B000069AT7|5.0|I liked the touched up portion of the movie.  The use of Computer Graphics improved many of the special effects not possible in 1982.  Computer generated muscle and skin movement gave E.T a more earthy image.<br />E.T invokes strong emotions.  Director Steven Spielberg comments E.T characters were representive of experiences in his childhood, such as, the divorce of his father and mother.  E.T symbolizes Director Steven Spielberg's pain surround his parent's separation, recover through healing power, and the magic of friendship.
B00005JK8K|4.0|I really liked this movie and Nicolas Cage does a wondeful job starring as a battle scarred Sergeant recruited to protect a Navajo &quot;codetalker&quot; from falling into Japanese hands during the Saipan battle of 1945.  The only problem I had with this movie is that they didn't show enough of the Navajo telling the coordinates during major battles, but it's still a pretty good war flick.
B0000060NF|5.0|Marvin's genius was ultimately manifest in this, his masterpiece, and it's beyond me how &quot;those wihtout ears&quot; can only hear but not listen to the incomparable *soul* of this great work of art.<br />The messages are quite obvious; lyrically, for soul music, it is progressive, but compared to what others, most notably Jimi and the Beatles, were doing in rock, it's not as advanced.  Still, when taken as a whole, there can be no doubt that &quot;What's Going On&quot; fuses the tangible - lyrics, performance, composition and production - with the ineffable - &quot;soul&quot; - into what contains that unmistakable major tone that separates great from lesser art.<br />The deep grooves and lyrical qualities of the quieter passages such as &quot;Flying High&quot; juxtapose to produce high and low, broad and narrow, in such a manner that, at the end, one feels as though s/he has been on a journey.  Marvin's art has that transcendent capacity: to free people's mind's and spirits, and take them &quot;somewhere else.&quot;<br />Thirty years since having been burnt by the flame of this art, I still marvel at Marvin's unique vision.  There's a saying that folks have: &quot;That's deep.&quot;  It conveys a &quot;something else&quot; that's not present at the surface of things.  It's that way with &quot;What's Going On,&quot; as true a testament to the artistic spirit by a titan at the height of his creative powers.<br />Purely and simply timeless, forever vibrant.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Well what can you say about an album of this stature? Well the awnser is not much. From the outset this thing creates a barely audioble drone which can't really be classed as music, it's musicians have less talent then the Venga Boys, it's title is highly unaumsing and I'd be ashamed to say I had anything to do with it. All in all a complete waste of your and my time.
0446677450|2.0|Take a look at the wide range of reviews here.. lots of fives, and lots of ones. The fives are high on the motivation from the book. The ones were looking for practical advice, and found none. This book WILL motivate you to improve your financial situation, but it will probably leave you wondering where to start. You should really only buy one of the books in his series if you are really interested. It doesn't matter which, because they all keep repeating the same things over and over. He will probably be pumping out books full of filler information until he dies. <BR>You will also notice at the beginning of all of his books &quot;Although based on a true story, certain events in the book have been fictionalized for educational content and impact.&quot; So, in other words, he makes up nonsense stories to try to sell you his ideas.
B000003TA4|1.0|That's exactly what this album is. A lot of people think it was Korn, but Nirvana were the true founders of this nu metal teen angst garbage. Just read the lyrics and you'll see what I mean. People regard Kurt Cobain as a genius? Judging by his performance he knows about three chords. Quit praising Nirvana. Grunge is dead and lets hope it stays that way. And go ahead and click the unhelpful button. I don't care what you think.
0812513495|3.0|After reading Ender's Game, any reader can see that Orson Scott Card has written a book with a most ironic ending.  Throughout the whole book, what the reader comes to suspect is totally changed by the ending and what goes on.  Credit the author for writing a great book, as a reader; I felt the turnout threw me off, which caused the book to fade.  The ironic endings were a huge surprise, but it took away from the book. Still this book was very well written, in the sense that it kept the reader guessing.  Not knowing what was going to happen next, and expecting something different, left the reader on the edge of their seats.  Many ironic situations come about right at the end of the book; Ender destroys the bugger species, Peter takes over the world, and then \\"colonists\\" settle on the buggers past homeland.<BR>     <BR>     During Ender's vigorous training at the Battle School, he was, in a sense, separated from all the soldiers (solely because of his abilities).  \\"You've been isolating the boy.  Maybe he's wishing for the end of this world, the Battle School.  Or maybe it's about the end of the world he grew up with as a little boy, his home, coming here,\\" was said by Major Imbu and shows the way he was treated at Battle School.  Never did the reader suspect that once Ender arrived at the I.F., he would be controlling his own Fleet.  All along Ender thought he was playing a simulation, but really he was fighting the Buggers.  At the end, when the I.F. finally gives Ender a chance for freedom, they trick him into destroying all of the buggers. Without his knowledge or permission, he ended a whole species.  While all of this is happening, Peter is back on Earth, planning for total domination.<BR>     <BR>     Peter lived his whole life as a supercilious person.  He felt that he was always better then Ender and felt he should have been the chosen one.  Peter talked of taking over the world, but thinking logically, how could a 12-year-old child take over the world?  Byhimself alone, Peter was not smart enough, but with the minds of two genius children, he was most definitely capable.  \\"But we don't think like other children do we, Val? We don't talk like other children. And above all, we don't write like other children.\\" This shows that Peter and Valentine could manage such an enormous task, but they just needed the right opportunity, which came when Ender destroyed the Buggers.  With Peter taking over the world, almost anything was possible, so why not colonize a planet they just destroyed?<BR>     <BR>     Since the buggers were finished, and the world was under new leadership, many people decided to travel and settle on the non-populated bugger planet.  Along with those explorers included Valentine.  She didn't want to stay on Earth with Peter as the leader, but she wanted Ender to come with her.  After much persuasion, Valentine changed Ender's mind about moving with her.  He sought this as an opportunity to learn about the history of the species he had just destroyed.  Studying about the buggers, and traveling the universe, Ender was going to try to start another bugger population.  Not knowing if he was successful is how the book ended.<BR>     <BR>     The ironic endings of the book Ender's Game, left the reader shocked, and filled with questions on why Orson Scott Card didn't notify the reader on what was going on.  The reader never thought that Ender could end a species, especially because we came to see Ender as a person who was forced to kill, but did intentionally want to hurt people.  Never for one second did the reader think that Peter was capable of taking over the world, when a few years past he was picking on his little brother.  And ironically after Ender devastated a whole population, unwillingly he inhabited their homeland.  This book is filled with irony, but that's what makes this book what it is.
B00006LHYC|5.0|I am truly satisfied. This is coming from a  person who truly loves the rainy gray tone of Laura Pausini's voice....in any language. She truly does shine in English and I wish her the best in further enlarging her already immense reach of pop music. As I listened to this album, I was pleasantly surprised to hear an English version of one of her best ballads..\\"In Assenza Di Te\\" , translated here as \\"It's Not Goodbye\\" AND also an almost identical version of \\"Il Mio Sbaglio Pi Grande\\" , translated to \\"Everyday Is A Monday\\" You will find plenty of mid tempo songs that contain proper vocalisms typical of Laura, and also the ballad that showcase her tone...those worth noting are the ultra sweet \\"If It's Not Love\\" and \\"Every Little Thing You Do\\". PLEASe buy this album, while its cheap! You will not regret buying this..If you truly love her Italian (or Spanish as well) work, this album will appease your taste.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera's first album was good, but I think this album is even better. A lot of people were understandably shocked when they saw the video for the leadoff single \\"Dirrty\\" (with Redman); when I saw the video I said, \\"Man, Christina looks...\\" And I still can't finish that sentence. Some people will probably say that she's trying too hard to break out of the teen-idol image, but when you stop to think about it, Christina was never really like that. For instance, back in 1999-2000, when girls talked about being just like their teenybopper idols, usually Britney Spears and sometimes Mandy Moore were mentioned, but I don't remember Christina's name ever coming up.<br />Though Christina says she's getting dirty (as the first single suggests) on this album and not apologizing for it, she titled the album Stripped, and she's not wearing a shirt on the album cover, there actually aren't as many songs of that nature on the album as I thought there would be. Also, I guess Christina anticipated some negative feedback to the \\"Dirrty\\" video and her new image because on the first song, the Lil' Kim-assisted \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", Christina brings it on almost politically when she says \\"It's a common double standard of society/The guy gets all the glory the more he can score/While the girl can do the same and yet you call her a w***e\\". (For the women that don't agree, don't deny that your eyes were glued to the TV whenever D'Angelo's \\"Untitled\\" video came on.)<br />Another interesting thing about this album is that it's a little hard to classify it in a specific genre. There are signs of rock (\\"Fighter\\"), `70s soul (\\"Impossible\\" with Alicia Keys), and Latin music (\\"Infatuation\\") to be found here, and Christina's vocals work well with the music. And don't think she's done with mellow songs. \\"Cruz\\" is nice to kick back and chill to even though it's hard to tell what it's about, but other cool tracks to check for are \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\", \\"Walk Away\\" and the slightly clich&eacute;d \\"Beautiful\\".<br />There is also original subject matter to be found on this album. \\"Fighter\\" has Christina thanking a man for doing her wrong because it gave her the strength to move on...a strength she didn't realize she had. \\"Impossible\\" turns a situation around where she says she can't be with her man if he doesn't tell her what he's feeling (I say the situation is turned around because it's usually the other way around), and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is a playful new twist on casual sex. But the most interesting song to me is \\"I'm OK\\", where Christina talks about how her father abused her and her mother.<br />Some people may be saying, \\"You gave her first album four stars. You think this one is better, so why give IT four stars?\\" Well, for one thing, I'm really not feeling \\"Make Over\\", especially the production and that screaming she's doing during the chorus. Also, this album is 78 minutes long, so a few songs start to sound the same, particularly the \\"we-are-the-world\\" type songs \\"Soar\\" and \\"The Voice Within\\". But those songs are still pretty good though. In fact, this album should cause you to do some creative rewinding, and although some people may be tired of female artists doing rebirths for their sophomore albums (see also Pink), Stripped sure sounds good to me.autiful\\".<br />There is also original subject matter to be found on this album. \\"Fighter\\" has Christina thanking a man for doing her wrong because it gave her the strength to move on...a strength she didn't realize she had. \\"Impossible\\" turns a situation around where she says she can't be with her man if he doesn't tell her what he's feeling (I say the situation is turned around because it's usually the other way around), and \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" is a playful new twist on casual sex.

B00004XQP4|1.0|TRUST Me, i used to like greenday when they were still real- when they still had their punk juices flowing; but this album is simply [not good]- it's not punk anymore; i didn't feel even a single punk vibe throuhout the whole album, it's all pop, meaningless, collection of radio-friendly ... songs; some say they matured in this album, but i say they just sold out; some say blink 182 and sum-41 [are not good], but this one proves green day is the worst among all of them; so if you're a pop fan and you like nsync, buy this one coz green day lowered down to this level known as pop music; but if you're a true punk fan, PLS. DON't BUY THIS ... coz it's just not punk anymore. TRUST ME, just buy NOFX, BAD RELIGION, PENNYWISE albums instead coz they are the true punkers around.
B00004RHZU|4.0|I don't know, some of the songs on this album sound too much a like. This was when Pink was very unoriginal and just seemed like an easy marketed product. Her music was like that too. But if you're looking for good carbon-copy R&amp;B/soul/pop/hip-hop, hit this album up! You won't be disappointed!
B00006LWSF|5.0|WOW! This is definitely one of the best cd's of 2002, not only does this cd include the greats like Gang Starr & Jay-Z, it has great songs by the whole shady records crew. I was really pleased to finally hear 5 (counting the D12 Song) eminem songs on one album where he didnt talk about the things he normally does, dont get me wrong i love eminem but he seems more like a real MC when he actually raps where as when he just pokes fun at people he just seems like a rapper. the highlight of this cd is definitely the songs \\"Run Rabbit Run\\" By Eminem, \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" by Obie Trice, \\"Rap Game\\" by D12, and \\"Spit Shine\\" by Xzibit. overall this cd is definitely worth buying. there were only 2 dissapointments on this cd, the song by Macy Gray and the song by Nas. first off i would like to say that if you like Macy Gray this may not be a dissapointment but i think that her voice is one of the worst in the industry. second, the Nas song just isnt as good as something you would expect off Stillmatic, I am..., Illmatic, or even (dare i say) Nastradamus. he spends way too much time dissin Jay-Z and the beat is just not as good as it could be. but other than that i totally reccomend this cd to any fan of eminem or just a rap fan, it is worth the money!
B00005QDW1|4.0|I really love this CD, even though \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is my favorite of No Doubt's albums. I love the mix and clash of different genres of music that they put on this album, it's really ill. I was really impressed by Gwen too. She's really enigmatic to me, I love her style and her sex appeal. Work it out!
B00006G8LB|5.0|If you want something you can probably enjoy forever this is it. There's some violence and would probably scare little kids.  But this is for the big kids.  Really cool. Clean,honest, TOTTALY fun. You'll really enjoy it. The movie takes you right along with it, and I got tottally enveloped by the story-line.  Always wanting more.  The effects were very good. On the levil with Star Wars, (better than the Phantom Menace) and the music was good.  What really gets me into it is 'cause Parker started out as just an ordinary kid next door.  And that just gives you something to relate with this character from the very biggining. I just got wrapped up in the story, it's really great. I think you'll enjoy it. Don't miss SPIDER-MAN!
B00005N83M|3.0|The only reason that I bought this CD was because I thought there would be more tracks like &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing.&quot; But there weren't. Really, the only other songs worth listening to her album were the singles that she released. And what's even more whack about it is that the remixes were better than the original...sad.
B00005B4GU|4.0|This album has much in common with the album that Radiohead released just before this, \\"Kid A\\".  I have not heard all of that album yet, but what I have heard (Everything In Its Right Place, The National Anthem, Optimistic, Idioteque, Morning Bell) is great. This is much more piano-driven than Kid A, or any of their previous albums (although I've only heard OK Computer in its entirety, so I might be wrong...lol). So, on with the track reviews!...<br />1 Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box - This is a marvelous opener, and one of the album's highlights for me.  Kitchen pot and water pipe percussion make the tune oddly danceable, with the synthesizer lending the melody.<BR>2 Pyramid song - Yikes. This is pure genius.  Thom's utterly depressed, half-mumbled vocals and the piano and the strings. It's a great moment when the drums kick in. This was the first single...pretty nice curveball to throw the public with, right?<BR>3 Pulk/pull revolving doors - This is fuzzed-out techno that could just as easily be on a Autechre record.  The huge drum beat and bass fuzz (yeah Colin!) make it feel like you're in the \\"Alien\\" spaceship. Lyrically, though, it's one of Thom's worst.  It's good that you can't understand him most of the time...<BR>4 You and whose army? - The jazzy, soft guitar chords that open this are really relaxing after \\"Pulk/pull revolving doors\\", but Thom's mumbled, reverb-shrouded vocals add a note of tension.  It's great when the piano, drums, and acoustic guitar enter when Thom sings \\"We ride, we ride\\". Sort of like late Beatles...but only sort of.<BR>5 I might be wrong - I absolutely love this. Jonny's twangy, distorted lead guitar line is fantastic, and Phil's drum programming is awesome, too.  The only complaint I have is that I can't really hear what Thom is singing on this version.  For a comprehensible version of Thom singing, listen to the live version on \\"I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings\\". I love how it switches to the two bass drum hit part withonly a minute to go. This was the third single.<BR>6 Knives out - This is most like old-school Radiohead.  It's melody resembles \\"Paranoid Android\\" a little, but it is by no means \\"Paranoid Android\\" 2. Jonny's lead guitar is really good.<BR>7 Amnesiac/Morning bell - ... what a death march. The original was so much better. Thom's vocals are largely unchanged from the original, but the musical setup is totally different, with a piano, lots and lots and lots of bells (hey, that's ironic), acoustic guitar, and tambourine. Phil's drumming was so good on the first one. This is probably the low point.<BR>8 Dollars and cents - Phil's drumming is simply some of his best...it is pure jazz drumming, with great reverb on the snare. The echo on Thom's vocals makes him sound like he's singing it in a toilet. The guitars are nice to hear, and the strings are oh-so-over-the-top 70's. It's an anticapitalist song...but it's still very good.  It gets it's point across without ranting.<BR>9 Hunting bears - This is a doodly instrumental.  Some obviously improvised guitar and keyboard. Not much here, though I love the title.<BR>10 Like spinning plates -  This will knock your socks off. I bet Thom, Jonny, Ed, Colin, Phil and Nigel Godrich were all laughing like maniacs when they recorded it. Backwards.<BR>11 Life in a glasshouse - The greatest way to end. Quite literally, \\"a New Orleans death march\\". Jazz bandleader Humphrey Lyttleton's trumpet performance is absolutely beautiful. And the lyrics are back to godly status.<br />The album's great!
B00000ADG2|5.0|Wow, this album is totally amazing. I'm blown away by the skill and effort that went into making this wonderful album! The lyrics, the production...everything about this CD is on point. There isn't a track on the album that I do not love.
B00000ICN5|5.0|He never cut a bad album, and this one is no exception. I've listened to this album over and over, and never tired of it.
B000003TAB|5.0|Have you worn out the grooves of your NEVERMIND CD? Do you recite MTV UNPLUGGED IN NEW YORK in your sleep? It's time to take a look at INCESTICIDE if you still haven't. True, this collection of out-takes and B-sides doesn't quite measure up to one of their \\"official\\" albums, but it is still quentessential Nirvana. It shows you different sides of Nirvana - including a warped sense of humor.<br />Most of this rocks really hard. That's certainly true of the Meat Puppets nod \\"Son of a Gun,\\" and the old school stomp of \\"Aero Zepplin.\\" \\"Dive\\" is one of the best and kinda freaky the way Kurt sounds as if he's screaming \\"Die with me!\\" instead of \\"Dive with me!\\" Kurt really conveyed a lot not only with his lyrics but also his tortured guitar. Kurt's solos were expressive, anguished and incredible and that's apparent on this album.<br />You can definitely get your Nirvana on here. Blows away most bands who were influenced by grunge. That's not to say that there aren't tons of great bands out there who were influenced by Nirvana. But there's only one Nirvana.
B00006V9A0|4.0|For such an innovative band, this is an unimaginative product. I could think of a few ways that this compilation would have worked better. A few B-sides, like the wonderful &quot;Even In His Youth&quot; (B-side of the &quot;Teen Spririt&quot; single)' a couple of demos; something from the &quot;Muddy Banks&quot; CD; heck, I'd settle for a Neptunes remix of &quot;Heart-Shaped Box&quot;. Why are we given ONE &quot;new&quot; track to chew on? <br />The music itself is wonderful.
0684869713|5.0|I discovered this book while dipping into the campus bookstore during an anti-war march (I was an engineering student - not a marcher).  I liked architecture and picked it up.  WOW!  The strangest thing I've read in the reviews is the criticism of the writing which I think is both bitter and brilliant.  <br />Just as Atlas Shrugged was about Dagny and Hank, this story is about Dominique and Wynand.  Wynand's depiction is surely one of the greatest of all time...just the right touch.  In the end, Roark is still distant, unknown, more an idea than a flesh and blood person.  But the way the plot weaves and intertwines and finally joins is just incredible!  Especially moving are the scenes between Roark and Wynand, particularly their parting.<BR> <BR>This is a startling book because it is so different from the vast majority of what is now published - shoddy stories filled with cardboard characters, needless gore, obscenity, non-stop action and a complete lack of intellectual focus. It seems quite timeless (I first read it in 1969) even today because its focus is not trendy events or fads but the timeless interplay of people.  Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy.
B00006C7G9|5.0|As a history teacher who, by the way, does NOT enjoy violent war movies as a rule, I can only say that this series is mesmorizing.  It is the best movie I have ever seen, and I have been waiting and hoping that the powers that be would choose to release it on video.  I used segments of the film in my AP US History class last year and my students were equally enthralled by it.  It's not only compelling in it's own right, but it tells a very important story about what civilized society asks of its soldiers.  If you don't purchase it, please make a concerted effort to view it at some point.  It's EXCELLENT.
B000068TPN|5.0|In the latest wave of war movies between the line of Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line comes We Were Soldiers staring Mel Gibson as Hal Moore.<br />   Moore is a family man who is dedicated to everything including his men that he is ordered to send most to their final destination...Vietnam.  The year is 1965 and they have to protect and take over La Drang Valley also known as \\"The Valley of Death\\" as Moore and copany embark on this noble and suicidal mission they have one thing in common.  They are fighting not for America and not even for freedom but for eachother.  Mel Gibson brings out the raw emotion and the courage that is shown through out this movie.  A commander that had to be strong and brave and knowingly order thousands to their death.  <br />   After this movie you see the other side of war you see what it is like to be the last and only one to see the whole thing alive and in one piece.  You see the courage that all the american men had to be in the war that they were in.  All the men were in one way or another married to eachother in combat.  Each of them had a common respect and courtesy towards one another and each wanted to see the next make it to the next day.  <br />   \\"Till death do us part\\" is the message that you hear through out this film and even after death parting is no easier.  This film is one that I would highly recommend for the young and the old alike to watch.  Afterwards share and maybe if you are close to the Vietnam Wall, go pay a visit to those names that you have just seen on this movie and see what happens to you.  I know that you never knew them but I promise you will share in the grief that their families faced when they heard of their loved ones passing.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|It seems that Disney loves to bring a wonderful movie out and then take it back and revamp it and bring it out again just to see if they can make it better.  Well, with Beauty and the Beast they have done just that.  When this film was first released in 1991 was a instint classic to the crowd of young and old.  Then as time expired and technology grew and DVD players arrived.  Disney decided to take Beauty and the Beast of the market and recreate it a little and re-release it.<br />   This timeless classic about a beast that lives in a castle where he has been living ever since he was cast under a spell by a old women and a young women named Annabelle who is the girl of any guy's wildest dream collide together.  Annabell runs into the forest in the late evening and is hunted down by wild dogs who try to hurt her and yet the beast comes and helps her out and takes her to his castle.  The beast who has no behavior qualities to him has help from the servants who are suffering under the same spell as the beast and were turned into different types of either china or piece of furniture.  As the story progrosses...Anabelles father finds out that she is in the castle and wants to save her.  The father knows of only one person who will help him and that is this guy who is in love with Annabelle and yet knows that she doesn't like him.  The story moves on to the point that there is a romance growing between Annabelle and the Beast and yet the Beast needs to find true love before the spell ends or else he will end up a beast for good.  Watch this funny, romantic, and cute animated movie together as a family and relive a classic over and over again. It is worth watching. <br />Also with DVD comes comentaries and games.
B0000026NC|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Floyd albums.  It contains a good mix of songs from the The Wall era and newer, which for me, is great as I'm not really into the old (more weird) Floyd.<br />After reading all the reviews on Amazon about how Pulse was \\"so much better\\" I bought Pulse also.  Well, I've only listened to it once by Delicate is in my CD player right now.  I'm not saying that Pulse is bad, but I like the ambiance and overall \\"feel\\" of Delicate better than Pulse.  Let's just say that it reminds of a more \\"hazy\\" period in my life than Pulse does :^)
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Nearing 50 years since his first recordings, Johnny Cash at 70 years old has retained the steely resonance of his classic recordings to create another album to rank alongside his very best. His voice, which could never be described as polished, has become even more rugged, but has not withered: this voice is still a force, and carries more authority and grit than any other in music. From the opening track - a brand new self-penned song, also the title of the album - Cash returns to his classic themes of God, love, and murder. The Man Comes Around is biblical in content and is an excellent opening track. Glancing at the CD cover, before listening to the album, we can wonder what Cash will do with well-covered songs such as Bridge Over Troubled Water, Streets Of Laredo and Desperado. Naturally, he makes them his own, and on Bridge Over Troulbled Water and Danny Boy he shows that his vocal range is greater than he is often given credit for. A rockabilly cover of Depeche Mode's Personal Jesus is another highlight, but the real standout track is his cover of the Beatles' In My Life. Cash delivers the lyrics with conviction and great feeling. <BR>This album deserves to further add to the legend that is Johnny Cash. A musical giant, his integrity and unwavering beliefs sound out in every note of this great album, which is unquestionably the best release of the year by any artist.
B00006V9A0|5.0|The music's good, but I give you one paragraph of liner notes written by David Fricke:<br />\\"The absolute magic and democracy of rock and roll is that anyone with a good hook and a fighting heart can change the world overnight. Kurt did it twice: on September 24, 1991, the day Nevermind, Nirvana's second album, went on sale and loudly announced that Michael Jackson was toast and rock was a weapon again; and on April 8, 1994, when Kurt's body was found, dead by his own hand, in a room over his garage in Seattle. The gaping hole he left in the belief that rock and roll saves lives is still there. So is the fear of going all the way that has paralyzed so much of the music ever since.\\"<br />...
B00005NB8J|3.0|My personal feelings about stargate is that although the premise may not be realistic or believable, what sci-fi movie really is?<br />Are we so naive to think that an eight foot tall half man / half machine in the name of Darth Vader is realism at it's best?  The folks crying that Stargate is totally out there, are probably not science fiction fans, which I have to say, if you don't enjoy sci-fi, why even bother watching the movie if you already have your mind made up that you won't like it because it's not believable?<br />I'll admit, when I saw the movie in the theatres, I left thinking it wasn't very good, infact I remember saying to a friend &quot;that ending was pretty stupid&quot;.<br />However after becoming a huge fan of the television series during the first episode, I was amazed at how they changed the entire idea of the movie to developing a great series.<br />After watching the 2nd season, I decided to watch the Stargate movie again, and this time I actually enjoyed it, albeit the action scenes were sometimes over the top, and that corny ending still leaves a slightly bitter taste in my mouth, I still bought the movie on DVD.<br />This edition is rather poorly transferred, and I would not recommend buying it, however it's still a good movie if you enjoy Stargate: SG-1
B000002MZ9|3.0|How can this be?  Any one of these tracks would make a welcome addition to a different CD, but together they lay waste to a disk.  Mirror Ball is like one long crashing guitar workout surounding Neil Young's thin voice.  While the overall sound is appealing, the lack of variety wears thin by song 4.  It takes several listens to separate out the few pearls from the drones, in particular I'm the Ocean and Throw Your Hatred Down.  The album gets an extra star for originality, as do most of Neil Young's works, but ultimately the barren three chord formula cannot sustain its weightiness.
B00005KHL0|5.0|Halloween was great. But it always seemed a little too short with a narrow plot. But now that i purchased the new version with 12 minutes of extra scenes it seems even more enjoyable. Simply the best horror movie ever, if you havent seen it and like thrillers, slashers or just great historical moviemaking landmarks, see Halloween.
B000069KE0|1.0|If you already own the Chicago catalog on CD from its original Columbia release or it's Chicago Records release don't bother picking this up. While the packaging Rhino came up with is wonderful, that money would have been better spent on ACTUALLY REMASTERING this classic album.<br />I compared the \\"remasters\\" of CTA, Chicago (II) and Chicago III to the earlier Columbia CD issues. After adjusting the levels to be even the only difference between the 2 CD copies was that the \\"remasters\\" had a very blary in-your-face mid range feel that actually buried the vocals and drums at times in the mix. On some tracks it actually became annoying. Not a hint more bottom on the toms or bass guitars, not a hint brighter on the cymbals or other perscussion. There is ALMOST NO increase in overall dynamic range from the original CDs.<br />If you're into the liner notes and / or packaging then this CD is worth it. HOWEVER if you actual buy CDs for the MUSICAL CONTENT, you are simply wasting your time and money. You can find my copies on [local store], I'll stick with the \\"[poor]\\" packing of the originals.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Hopefully this album will get her out of that Britney, Mandy Moore, and Jessica Simpson Catagory. Probably Not.  This CD is ill though.  My favorite joint is \\"Love Me for Me\\".  Chris, do ya thing girl.  Stay Chiseled and Bulletproof
B00005UDOG|5.0|I can't believe I'm the first person to review what is probably the best album of the last decade.  Not only does Fiona Apple write all of her own lyrics, she also creates all of the instumentals.  She is an incredible artist with a beautiful voice and a lot to say.  As a music lover, female artists especially, this album is a must.
0375414053|1.0|This book is the most disgracefully unfeminist novel to come out in ages - not because the narrator elects to spend more time with her children at the end - but because the narrator (and, implicitly, the author) feel compelled to criticize EVERY other female character she comes across, from co-workers to total strangers shopping for shoes. Breathtakingly smug and full of velvet viciousness, Pearson employs her considerable intelligence and wit to keep other women firmly in their place - i.e., well below her in the feminine pecking order.<br />A few examples:<br />Her supposed best friend, Candy, is \\"foul-mouthed...pencil-thin with prominent breasts; this got her plenty of lovers but not a lot of love...congenitally single.\\"  This is what she says about a friend? Of course, Candy is an American and a feminist....but by the end, she has been tamed by motherhood, moved back to New Jersey and started a mail-order sex-toy business (those vulgar Americans!) Of course good-girl Kate's happy ending involves living in pastoral yuppie splendor in Derbyshire marketing dollhouse furniture. Does Liberty of London make floral barf bags to go with this scenario?<br />Mere paragraphs later, a damning appraisal of office mate Celia Harmsworth:<br />\\"Breasts come in twos, but a bust is always singular; the pliant pair meld into a fiberglass monopod sloping gently downward like a continental shelf. The Queen has a bust and so does Celia Harmsworth...Celia is one of the least human people in the building; childless, charmless, chilly as Chablis.\\"<br />Kate not only gives Celia the deep freeze, she manages the trifecta - criticizing the other woman's age, appearance, and her (lack of) marital status all in one go (what is the author's obsession with other women's breasts?) Later, Kate delivers an even more revealing critique: \\"Celia is one of those spinsters who adored being the only woman in a man's world; it was license to feel pretty before girlies like me showed up and ruined her monopoly.\\" <br />Me-ow! Another woman who wants feminism to work for her at the office and on the home front but feels compelled to cut down any rival for the very elixir of life: male attention. <br />But Kate never misses an opportunity to mention that she's got great legs. Though entitled to feel superior to less attractive women than herself, God forbid her husband flirt with a trim Frenchwoman in the pool - a woman, who because she doesn't have a full-time job, gets to work out all day and is therefore to be dismissed as vain bimbo. <br />No matter what kind of woman you are or what choices you make in life, in Kate Reddy's world, you are a rival, a threat, a loser, or dying of cancer (another judgmental subplot involving a saintly mother's demise.)  And when her husband finally leaves her, her first move isn't to communicate with him - no, Kate rushes home to lay her marital failure at the feet of her less-successful sister as a sacrificial offering, expecting the very schadenfreude she enjoys at the expense of other women!<br />In comparison, Kate lightly lets off her sexist male co-workers for outrageous crimes in a tossed-off subplot involving a disposable diaper scheme. Sure, they're jerks, but she saves her most withering barbs for the poor immigrant girl at the coffee counter - who's probably got two kids of her own but can't afford a nanny.<br />The most bizarre thing about the story is that Kate would have a lot more quality time to spend with her family if she wasn't so concerned about \\"keeping score\\" against other women on a variety of meaningless fronts, like faking homemade mince pies so the other mothers (who could probably care less anyway) don't take ten points off her Superwoman score. You can do it all - if you're willing give up navel-gazing and one-upmanship as blood sports. But Kate won't do that - it's her right as a woman to compete in every event in the Ovo-Olympics, including, in yet another unsavory example of woman-hating, competitive shoe-snatching at the department store.<br />Clearly, Pearson has one big rival on her mind: Helen Fielding, creator of the much-loved Bridget Jones. Here Pearson falls far short of her intended target.  Fielding's comic style is zesty and light-hearted, relying on creativity and character for laughs instead of milking ... put-downs and outdated male-female observations that were stale two generations ago when Phyllis Diller first used them. Pearson's imitation of Fielding's epistolary style is cheap, and her chat-show jabs at Bridget are embarrassing (she's actually said that Bridget would never last five minutes in Kate's shoes, as if nappy-changing rivaled flying the space shuttle in complexity.) Though Pearson plays up here feminist career credentials, her lack of charity towards other women is as depressingly retrograde as a pointy bra.<br />Final score (with apologies to Susan Faludi): Bridget Jones 1, Kate Reddy 0.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|When &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; came out in theaters over 10 yrs ago, I thought this movie was the best animation feature that Disney had released, and since that time none have come close.<br />So when Disney released this film classic on DVD, I had to buy it, even though I already own the VHS version.<br />Boy! I am very happy with my purchase, the additional scene goes very good with the flow of the original version, and it is hard to tell that a scene was added.<br />For those who haven't seen the Broadway production might wonder where on earth did they come up with this?  The music was original, but I guess for time, they(producers/director) decided to scrap it.  However, it was incorporated in to the Broadway production.<br />The DVD version is fabulous, the animation is much clearer and the music crisp.  One of the many bonuses of having DVD is the menu options...they even have a sing-along option!
630469878X|1.0|This mysandrous film serves only to depress, rather than invigorate, women.  It posits an alternate reality in which all men are schmucks, women have no power over their circumstances but are &quot;driven&quot; to disastrous choices by men, and the last best hope for all females is suicide.  Fortunately, despite the sledgehammer force with which the movie attempts to deliver its message, it just doesn't ring true.  The world is not nearly as hopeless as man-haters would have us believe.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I was very impressed when I listened to this CD. Christina has a tremendous voice and has come a long way from the little girl that came on the scene a few years ago. I enjoy each and every one of the tracks, yet my most favorite is the one by Alicia Keys. I must say that she is definitely on her way. Watch out Britney Spears!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|The Johnny Cash/Rick Rubin partnership has yielded some great performances over the past few years, and opened up a whole new audience for one of our country's truly original artists. The tandem continues strongly with &quot;American IV&quot;.<BR>Johnny's voice has lost a little over the past few years (the result of a serious illness), but his emotional level of singing remains as strong as it was 40 years ago. On such classics as &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (the true higlight of this disc, done as a duet with Nick Cave), and &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (a brilliant cover choice), Johnny simply shines. It's no wonder his recording career has been as long as it has - all elements of this recording are strong, and passionate.<BR>NOt all of the cover selections are as strong this time out, however, and there are two glaring misfires. &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, which was a strong synth-pop hit for Depeche Mode some years ago, sounds dated and uninspired. And a weird remake of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters&quot;, featuring Fiona Apple doing something in between talking and singing, just doesn't belong on this album.<BR>Overall, however, it is always a pleasure to hear Johnny Cash sing. It's a shame there probably won't be a tour following this record, but any additions to the Johnny Cash songbook are welcome in a world of synthetic music. His vocals, and playing ability just aren't found that often in today's marketplace.

She runs away only to meet a charming mutt named Tramp for he shows her what a dog's life can really be and gives her a life-changing adventure she won't never forget.<br /><br />This is one of Disney's most cherished masterpieces! ever since it debuted in 1955 it became one of disney's most charming and brilliant animated movies. There's brililant timeless animation from the disney staff here especially that classic dinner moment between our title couple, fantastic voice work by Allan Reed (\\"The Flintstones\\"), Peggy Lee (who also co-wrote some of the songs), and Bill Thompson plus memorable songs like \\"This is the Night\\", \\"We are Si-amese\\" and \\"He's a tramp\\" makes this a must-have disney movie for anyone's collection.<br /><br />This 2-Disc platinum series DVD has quality picture and sound with some very good extras like deleted scenes, games and activities, featurettes, original World of Walt Disney episode that takes a behind the scenes peek of the movie, trailers, and art galleries. This is an unforgettable disney classic that should be viewed by your family, get it while it lasts.
0812550706|4.0|Imagery gives an author total control over one's imagination. It helps them to form the most vivid and beautiful images in our mind's eye. Some authors take a less direct approach to imagery however. Orson Scott Card who wrote ender's game let's our imagination roam freely in his novel. Rather than painting a blend of color in our minds he rather explores what we as individuals might see. If two readers of ender's game were to compare thoughts as to how they viewed parts of the book, the comparison would be quite different. Some might say that Card lacks imagery and that it was hard to see what the author was talking about. The lack of imagery did not hinder the story however as we see ender as an extremely round and deep character. Perhaps Card wished to emphasize the true complexity of ender rather than distract us with deep or exciting images. Card story does not need imagery to compel a reader to explore the pages of the novel. The so called \\"lack\\" helps isolate the reader into his or her own view on the book. What we gain from the novel is almost completely formed from our own images rather than the author's written one's. This is why some hate the book, because of their own lack of imagination rather than the author's lack of descriptive images. A little more imagery would have taken away from our own mind. And our own thoughts are always more important than the author's.
0316666343|5.0|To analyze the book in a linear way -- plot -- fails to do it justice as Mr. Harvey's demise might be considered &quot;contrived&quot; from a plot standpoint, but there is so much beauty in the book that I was more than willing to give that to the author -- a need for some closure, some &quot;justice.&quot;  <br />This book was hauntingly wonderful.  There are scenes I think of at moments during my day and I feel the way I remember being captured by the stillness of certain images in a black and white Bergman film.  <br />There is a simplicity to the book which allows one to fall (I certainly did) in-between the words... and that space is as infinite and lovely as heaven and lonely as hell.   <br />I highly recommend the experience.
B00005LQ6S|1.0|I was hoping that I'd find more negative reviews for this movie here on Amazon. Hopefully, I can aid in the effort to set everyone straight.<BR>This was a horrible movie. I rented 'Dungeons & Dragons'(2000) the week before and ejected the DVD from my player and returned it to the rental store after only 20 minutes of view time. The only reason I watched this turkey was because I loved the first movie so much.<BR>I'd like to point out one thing that I haven't seen anybody else say yet. At about the 30-minute mark in this movie, they started showing flashbacks. Now you'd think that with 3 previous films and six seasons of television episodes to pull from, they'd have plenty of good flashback material. And yet, in Highlander 4, we had to endure flashbacks of something we'd JUST SEEN 10 MINUTES AGO!!!!<BR>Bottom line, it seemed like some writer's 9 year-old child came up with the idea for this movie, and after only a few rewrites, we were presented with this drivel.
B00006L3S3|4.0|This review refers to the 2002 Capitol CD release of MIND GAMES,  a totally remixed and remastered version of the classic Lennon album. A lot of purists are angered that the John Lennon remastered series is also remixed, but to my untrained ear I really can't tell that much of a difference. I also have the original Parlophone CD versions of all of the classic Lennon albums, and this new remastered series is deffinately a huge sonic upgrade over the older Parlophone CDs. So all in all, buy this disc if you are a Lennon fan, the expanded liner notes alone make this CD a good value. But if you are looking for Beatlesque music, this disc will disappoint you.
078322608X|2.0|Can't touch the actor performances, but the story is more a competing morass of themes that leave the ending dead.  There is no real convergence of meaning because the themes never come together.  The psychiatric world is characterized accurately, especially in Dr. Railly's self-affirming statement to her supervisor.<br />Cole never figures out what his flashbacks are all about, and at the last minute takes an about face to change the future he knows can't be done.  What the time travel, psy-world, and animals rights activists have in common is unknown from start to end.  Each of these themes aren't explored and converged to produce anything stimulating.<br />Rent it if you're bored.  A much better story and drama is The Fifth Element.

0446608955|5.0|&quot;A Walk to Remember,&quot; written by Nicholas Sparks, takes place in a small town during 1958.  This love story is about a jock and a preacher's daughter falling in love.  Nicholas Sparks is known for writing touching love stories that you'll remember forever.  The popular jock, Landon,  needs a date for homecoming and ends up taking Jaimie Sullivan.  She is the preacher's daughter, goody two-shoes.  He ends up falling in love with her, which was the last thing everyone thought would happen.  If you like books that make you laugh and cry, then &quot;A Walk to Remember&quot; is for you.  Personally, reading this book was a very enjoyable experience.
B00006V9A0|4.0|The long awaited greatest his album from Nirvana is here after 8 long freaking years! The album opens up with You know your right the unrelease track, about a girl, been a song, silver, smells like teen spirit, come as you are, lithium, in bloom, pennyroyal tea, dumb, rape me, heartshape box, all apologies, the man who sold the world. I think Dave and Krist the surviving members shoudl have had a had an online poll on Courtneys website and had the fans vote for their favorite songs and put them on the track. Key tracks are missing polly, something in the way, negative creep, son of a gun. Having a two disc cd would of helped one with the greatest hits, and the other with videos or interviews or never before seen interviews, or pictures of the band.
0446677450|1.0|While the author of this book is obviously very well informed and experienced, I had a very hard time finishing the book.  I feel that it reads like an infomercial for his board game, and is very self-praising.  There are many very good lessons to learn, and I appreciate his effort to teach them in an easy manner.  Rather than purchasing this book, I strongly recommend that you buy &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;, I found that one more pleasurable a read, without the hints to purchase other products peppered through it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I rented the 2-disc DVD.  Two days later, I still had not made it through all the extra content Pixar gives!  The movie is excellent, with great wit by all characters, and drama, foreshadowing, suspense, surprise, and all the great aspects that give Pixar a good name.  The extras DVD was crammed with behind-the-scenes, outtakes (These were some of the best I've seen!), and 2 animated shorts, &quot;For the Birds&quot; and &quot;Mike's New Car.&quot;  On a bus trip, the whole bus cracked up for &quot;The Birds&quot;, and this wasn't the easiest bunch to find a movie on a bus trip amusing!  The behind-the-scenes will basically give you every little detail about animation (if you choose to watch all of the numerous clips.)  There's also a &quot;For Monsters Only&quot; section where you can read up about the monster world.  Overall, the DVD is EXCELLENT.  A must-buy.
B00005JKCH|5.0|When I first read that Tobey Maguire was cast as Peter Parker, I was crestfallen. &quot;Tobey Maquire?!?!&quot; I thought to myself. &quot;Surely, there's someone better than that for the role!&quot;<br />Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.<br />Tobey Maquire plays Peter Parker in an endearing way that portrays both the human and the superhuman side of our friendly neighborhood Spiderman. He's perfect in the role!<br />Having grown up with the Marvel Comics classic, I was a little skeptical of the whole project from the get-go. I didn't want another campy, cutesy movie based on a comic book that would ruin all the great feelings I had about the superhero. Thankfully, director Sam Raimi managed to pull it off -- with a little help from Maquire, Kirsten Dunst as MJ, Willem Dafoe as The Green Goblin, and a few other great character actors.<br />Sometimes, movies based on books (or even comic books) require a knowledge of the material before the movie makes sense. That's not the case with Spiderman, however. This movie can be enjoyed with no prior knowledge of Spidey whatsoever.<br />If you're looking for a little light entertainment, and want a fun, entertaining movie that's head and shoulders above most others released this past year, give Spiderman a try. Don't let the comic book theme or the hype scare you off. It's not a childish or overblown movie at all.<br />Spiderman easily qualifies as one of my favorite movies of the past couple of years. I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequel!

Her forth single \\"Amores Extraños\\" reach #1 at Billbaord 50 Latin Singles and another 6 singles reach the the chart top 10.<BR>Now she start in english with From the inside album... This one covers the demographic waterfront, representing every trend from Pop to Latin to R&B to Rock, because Laura is a unique mix of diferent rhythms and styles.<br />1. I NEED LOVE 10/10<BR>One of most beatiful ballads I've ever heard. Sweet and Powerful at trhe same time. My favority song of the album!<br />2. DO I DARE 10/10<BR> This song got a R&B beat, seems a little with \\"Destiny's Child\\" songs. I like it so musch. An nice midi-tempo song.<br />3. SURRENDER 9/10<BR>The first single from \\"FROM THE INSIDE\\" is a pop dance song. It's really a beautiful song.<br />4. IF THAT's LOVE 10/10<BR>The dark \\"If That's Love\\" is a monologue of a woman dissatisfied with her man. Intelligent and cynical, supported by Pausini's dramatically powerful voice, this song will twist you up and make you feel. It's my other favority song. <br />5. IT'S NOT GOODBYE 10/10<BR>This is a cover by Laura Italian hit \\"IN ASSENZA DI TE\\" that means \\"In Your Absence\\". It talks about when the one that you love passed away. It's so sad... so beutiful...<br />6. LOVE COMES FROM THE INSIDE 9/10<BR>The song title, has most '70 rock influences, seems a little Oasis. It's a great song!!!<br />7. EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO 9/10<BR>This song has most influeces for Madonna's album \\"RAY OF LIGHT\\". Dark and emotional, mix techno elements with rock, results in a beautiful ballad.<br />8. EVERYDAY IS A MONDAY 8/10<BR>Anonther hit fom Laura in Italian, this song not doing so well in english as the original. The lyrics becomes too much \\"teen\\", diferent from the original in Italian, but still is a nice song.<br />9. YOU ARE 10/10<BR>\\"You Are\\" is the kind tha song \\"very Pausini style\\". A beautiful ballad, so emotional, the kind of song that makes Lauta the Diva she is on Europe and South America.<br />10. I DO TO BE 10/10<BR> My favority up--tempo song. Very cool rhythm and lyrics, this song seems a little with Mariah Carey up-tempo songs. This will be a hit!<br />11. WITHOUT YOU 10/10<BR>Anther big ballad of Pausini's style. This one seems a little with Faith Hill's ballads. Very pretty!!<br />12. EVERY LITTLE THING YOU DO 10/10<BR>This reprise from the track 7, with only Laura's vocals and piano. It's most beautiful than the original. So emotional, Laura makes us really feel what she sings.
B00006L83N|5.0|Symphony X is America's most consistently interesting and magical progressive metal band. Their last studio album -- V -- raised the bar so high that I didn't think even they could top it.<br />But they did.<br />The Odyssey is a creation of staggering complexity and virtuosity, with guitarist Michael Romeo leading the charge in a big way. His neo-classical/Yngwie Malmsteen-esque fleet-fingered style shines brightly on The Odyssey, bathing the whole disc in an intense, warm glow.<br />Even though The Odyssey is more guitar-driven than V, that doesn't mean the other musicians take a back seat to Michael's desire to crank up the amps way past 11. Nope. Vocalist Russell Allen belts out the songs with vigor and passion...keyboardist extraordinare Michael Pinella (whose style truly moves me) plays a more understated, but critical role in helping to make The Odyssey the aural joy that it is...and rhythm section Michael Lepond and drummer Jason Rullo keep it all securely anchored, but with enough creative twists and turns to keep it interesting.<br />In some ways, The Odyssey is like V but without the seques. The production is astounding in its clarity and intensity, yet its fervor never loses sight of a killer melody and groove -- especially on tracks like \\"Incantations of the Apprentice.\\"<br />Symphony X has reached musical perfection. They're the most interesting progressive metal band in America, and easily the one that still continues to surprise with each new release.<br />Even the artwork and packaging are fantastic. <br />I highly recommend The Odyssey, Symphony X's magical music for the discerning listener.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is one of the best pop albums of the year. I was not that fond of Christina's earlier songs (only Genie in a bottle was original, the rest from OK to bad), but with this she has proved she's far much better than Britney and the rest. If only she would stop dressing herself up like a bimbo...She's going after Mariah Carey if it comes to the type of her looks, but as for the music she really has improved. <BR>So watch out Mariah, this one is here to stay!<br />The songs are variating and especially the ballads (like Walk away) are very beautiful, strong sung like Celine Dion but as original as Alicia Keys, the catcy tunes are R&amp;B and rock but very well done.<br />If Britney comes every year with an album with more beats and less clothes, it's nothing compared to the new work after three years from Christina. If it's got to be compared, Britney's recent products are more like a McDonald's snack on the bus to school, Christina's recent album is more like a 6 course diner on a roller coaster ride of which you just can't get enough of.
B00006LWSF|2.0|Eminem stars in the new movie 8 Mile under the direction of critically acclaimed director Curtis Hanson. Now only if the soundtrack was under the direction of a professional music executive. Instead we are given shameless filler promotion of Shady Records [with or without the promotion, the artists on it are likely to \\"Sell half\\" anyway, so why bother? Why not put some good rap music in? Old school songs that may have inspired Em? For rap and hip hop fans, Obie Trice has to be one of the worst debut rappers since, well...Bizarre. The production value is fair, and that's saying alot. The album doesn't much follow the movie [as Eminem had promised], and besides the lead single, there isn't much to look forward to. Hell, there's even a Macy Gray song [what was Em thinking?!] and a Boomkat [who???] song to fill up the rest of this lackluster. Burn it from the internet. Then tell me if it's \\"hot\\".
0783225547|5.0|Having been on a lake in Eastern Washington when the ash clouds rolled in, I can say that this film brought alot of memories back to me. I can simply say that the scenes dealing with ash, water, and mud are very well done and very realistic(No, I do not think a 4x4 can drive on lava!). We were then stranded on a highway with NO visibility, choking, and our engine dead from the ash. The film captures that very well. Also, as a professional offroad instructor, it was great to see a film deal with at least some aspects of real four wheel driving. This is a fun action movie regardless, but the fact that they researched volcanoes and included realistic special effects puts this high on my movie list. As I said, it certainly brings back memories!
0060922583|2.0|If you are a skeptic looking for some real scientific backing for claims of paranormal phenomena, this is NOT the book for you. If, however, you already accept stories of levitation, faith healing, and psychic abilities as the gospel truth, you will find ample pseudo-scientific gobbledygook within this tome to back yourself up when talking to gullible and/or uneducated people.<br />Talbot, an excellent writer, begins with the work of Karl Pribram, who does research into how the mind stores and retrieves memories. At some point, Pribram became aware of holograms, and found that the way the refracted laser light of hologram construction spreads out on its way to the film reminded him of the way a nerve impulse fans out at the end of a neuron. This, apparently, was enough to convinve Pribram (and Talbot) that not only is memory holographic, but so is the entirety of existence merely a holographic construct created by our brains.<br />From there, Talbot moves on, in a series of extremely well-constructed and well-reasoned arguments, to show that IF this theory of the nature of reality is true, then everything you ever saw in the Weekly World News and \\"The Matrix\\" could have more than enough scientific backing to convince any reasonable person of their reality. Diseases, even cancer, can be cured by merely willing them away. Levitation, pyrokinesis and ESP are there waiting for you to start doing them. It all makes a kind of sense, assuming, of course, you buy the premise of the book.<br />The real problem is that Talbot seems to accept these phenomena as true WITHOUT Pribram's hypothesis. At times, he almost seems to argue that because (for him) all of these mystical goings-on are well-established fact, then Pribram MUST be right.<br />Whether or not these things really happen, the whole book is based on an untested hypothesis based on an analogy drawn by one researcher. Does the analogy stand up when examined? How does the refracted light projected onto a film have anything to do with signals passing between physical neurons? Talbot never asks. For me, the analogy falls apart as soon as I take one step past noticing a correlation between the two events. This is more than Talbot (or, apparently, Pribram) ever does at any point in his book, so great is his enthusiasm.<br />Talbot (who I do not for a minute believe has any malicious designs in writing this book) has designed, down to the fine details, a beautiful castle in the air with no foundation. The world of possibilities he describes is truly wonderful and inspiring. I personally would love it if all the things in his book could be true. Of course, I thought the Tooth Fairy was a neat idea too, until I had experienced enough of the world to realize there was nothing substantial supporting my belief. Go read something by James Randi and clear your head.<br />Talbot gets the first star becuase Amazon does not allow a \\"zero stars\\" option, and earns the other star for attempting to deal in layman's terms with concepts of twentieth century physics. This is more than most schools do, leading too many people to accept premises such as Talbot's on faith alone.
0140042520|5.0|This was the first Karouac book i've read and it is still my absolute favorite book. I loved the journey he took and the people he met. it gave me a whole new outlook on life through  his interaction with the many interesting people he has met.<BR>this book takes you on an amazing  journey up and down from a mountain top to L.A. Each problem being encountered with a great outlook on life. this is a must read for anyone interested in amazing spiritual and physical journeys.
B00006CXXU|5.0|While I love &quot;Dirrty,&quot; (song and video), I'm not surprised at its poor charting - American Top 40 is too narrow for something like this.  As good as I think &quot;Dirrty,&quot; is, the rest of the album is even better, and in a more commercial direction.  With plenty of restraint, we get to hear this girl's subtler vocal stylings and the occasional well-timed drama moments.  I'm not exactly a fan of Christina Aguilera's, but this disc is refreshingly alluring.  Good job, Xtina, good job.
B000009O8A|4.0|After watching \\"Last House on the Left\\",\\"Zombie\\",and \\"The Beyond,\\" it's good to finally see a horror film that's taken seriously and done extrememly well. Wes Cravens LHOTL just seems to hold back a lot on the extreme, not to mention being in dire need of a good script, and the Fulci films seem to have good story ideas and a good effort, but in the end, it's executed a little poorly. <BR>I Spit on Your Grave is the cure.<BR>To keep it short, the story takes us to a summer house rented out by a quient, very kind and really attractive Jennifer (Camille Keaton). She is kidnapped by a few hillbillies, raped, beaten and left for dead. She then plots revenge and goes on to kill each attacker one by one. This film will upset a lot of people. The scenes where Keaton is raped and beaten are pretty intense, mostly because she acts through them with such brilliance, her screams sound so real you'll almost feel like she really was being raped. What also adds to your sympathy for her is her figure. I think it was a concious effort to try to get a very thin and weak looking women to play the part, b/c let's face it, as pretty as Keaton is, curves she has not. It's surprising her character didn't die during this ordeal. What I also liked in this film and as stated by other reviewers is how her wardrobe changes after she is almost killed. She stops wearing skimpy clothing and opts for a more conservative look. I also love the lack of a soundtrack, which may sound like it'll ruin the film but actually adds to its realism and makes it so much better.<BR>Even though the revenge plot is what makes the film and is the film it is not without its share of uncredibility. This is the reason I took off one star. For example, unless her main attacker is a real idiot, why would he trust this woman who he has just raped and almost killed to fall for him and want to get naked in the tub with him?? Also, in real life if a woman was in the same situation and was raped, do you think she'd still stay in that summer house for the remainder of the summer instead of going back home knowing full well her attackers are still somewhere nearby? I know in reality some people would be too ashamed to admit what happened to them which is understandable but what exactly kept Keaton's character in that house? Did she not want her money to go to waste or something? Com'on! <BR>Besides these flaws which will have you rolling your eyes at the screen, the film is incredible and although may not scare you with dark murky lighting or monsters and such, it's not that type of horror film. What's frightening about it is how easily the attackers were able to get their hands on this woman. It's scary because it shows you just how vulnerable you really are. I'd definitely recommend this film to any true horror fan, you won't regret it. I love this movie!
6305127697|4.0|When I had first laid eyes on Primal Fear on pay-per-view years ago I had first dismissed at as another Hollywood who-done-it courtroom drama with no originality.  And was I ever wrong.  Primal Fear may seem like something you've seen before, but the clever, highly intelligent, and twisting script makes the film soar to unexpected heights, and Edward Norton's breakout performace as murder suspect Aaron has to be seen to be believed (Norton would receive a Golden Globe and his first Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor which Cuba Gooding Jr. ended up winning for Jerry Maguire).  Richard Gere has the starring role playing Norton's lawyer who seems to be the only one who believes Norton's innocence.  With a super twist ending and a superb all star cast which includes Laura Linney, Frances McDormand, Steve Bauer, John Mahoney, Maura Tierney, and Andre Braugher, Primal Fear is a near superb little gem that I strongly suggest seeing.
0312265859|4.0|I have greatly enjoyed reading all of the Stephanie Plum mysteries. The Jersey-girl-turned-bounty-hunter is a terrific character, and so are the whole cast of folks who pop in and out of her chaotic life. You'll laugh a LOT, guaranteed. I just wish the mystery in this book was better thought out. The plot and its unlikely resolution seem almost like afterthoughts. Maybe you (like me) can live with that, in exchange for the fun of this highly character-driven series.
B00005KHJV|1.0|Don't even bother with this disc. Its a joke, a complete and utter joke!! I saw this at my local electronics outlet along with the theatrical version. Both released by the same company. Yet for some reason the theatrical DVD comes with a whole bunch of great features and video and audio remastering while this \\"extended\\" disc is in 2 channel Dolby and comes with no extras. Bah! While the extra scenes added to the original are nice, they're not spectacular. (For those who don't know, the TV network standards required cuts to be made in the movie, the movie would be under time, so Debra Hill and the crew making Halloween 2 spent 3 days shooting additional scenes for the TV Version.) There's really only one scene that stands out - Loomis goes to Myers psych ward room to find \\"Sister\\" carved on the door. There, now go buy the theatrical disc.
B000001IQH|5.0|this is my favourite CD! I love every song on it. i always have this CD in my walkman at school as i walk down the hallway while the preps make out. these songs make me feel good. especially \\"Ruby Soho\\". the \\"Ruby Soho\\" video makes me PROUD to be a PUNK. i don't know why, it just does. the song \\"Roots Radical\\" makes me all warm and fuzzy inside...BUY THIS CD!!!!
B00006D295|5.0|Check your sanity at the door because you're in for one heck of a ride. What other movie can you put aside all your inhibitions and truly enjoy yourself?<br />\\"Give yourself over to absolute pleasure.

B000002KIE|5.0|This CD is a classic. A bassist that doesn't know how to play never sounded so great.

Listen CLOSELY. you'll see that...well, just listen closely!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|For those convinced that beauty is a cosmetic thing--the equivalent of a Sears painting you buy and hang because it harmonizes with your furniture--the deep weathered-wood furrows in Cash's aging voice will no doubt jar and upset.  But Cash has been everywhere and done everything, and to this listener, those scars, those tear-tracks, those laugh-lines and crow's feet, make all the difference.  &quot;Hurt&quot; is a twofold wonder: it proves that a) Trent Reznor was a great songwriter and b) Cash can make any song his own.  &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot; has never sounded so tragic.  &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; glowers.  &quot;Desperado&quot; suddenly seems to predate its creators.  And &quot;In My Life,&quot; already a sweet but sincere sigh of nostalgia, gains a whole new dimension, sung by a man whose long life, deep pains, and deeper loves have granted him the final great gift which most artists never achieve: authority.  Closing with &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; adds a final touch of much-needed whimsy without ever dispelling the pathos.  <br />Here is a moving, meaningful work by a great artist nearing his end.  He may be with us for years to come, and sing many more songs (God, I hope so), but no would deny (Cash least of all, I think) that there are fewer days ahead than behind.  <br />Lucky for us, the man that gave voice to brooding youth and responsible maturity can now guide us toward the waning years, teaching us how to remember, how to be grateful, and how to squeeze every last drop from the lives we're given.  An unforgettable album.
B00004XQP4|5.0|This album is underrated. It's my favorite Green Day album. The best song is \\"Minority\\". I also love \\"Blood Sex & Booze\\", an awesome tribute to S&M, and \\"Misery\\", a polka-like some that is could really scare you late at night when your tired. Well, you really should buy this cd!!!!
B00005JL2O|1.0|Following in the proud tradition of lousy sequels that have plagued America in recent years (Blair Witch 2, Blade 2, etc.), this is another example of the \\"dumbing down\\" of America.  The original Austin Powers was good - it was funny, and was a good parody.  The sequels have been detestable.  Story and effort are once again compromised for lame bits that play like short skits from Saturday Night Live.
0571212689|5.0|This book is simply an amazing publication on how to create animation.  I was sent to China to teach animation principals to fledgling animators . . . this book practically saved my life.  <br />Having studied animation for nearly ten years, I thought teaching a six month class would be a breeze.  If it weren't for this book, the students would be hearing repeat material after about three weeks.  The chapters on walks are enough to teach for an entire semester.  <br />Dick provides a simple example for just about every animation situation.  Then he goes on to show you how to modify the thing in a dozen different ways, as if this knowledge is just sitting on a shelf with nothing better to do.  It's just incredible.<br />This book is an absolute must for CG and traditional animators alike.  Given the amount of information in The Animator's Survival Kit, a purchase price should be closer to that of a few semesters tuition.
B00005JKWJ|1.0|Has the movie-going public sunk to the level that garbage like this can be released and be profitable?  The original Blade was a first-rate movie.  The story was coherent, the characters had some depth, and some actual thought appeared to go into the script.  None of that is present in this movie.  It's like watching a John Woo travesty; one dumb action sequence after another, with little or no story in between.  This movie flashes before you eyes like an MTV video, and is about as memorable.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is my favourite Austen novel, and this is a wonderful adaptation of it.  Mrs Bennet is just as I pictured her.  (The poor woman and her nerves!)  Elizabeth sparkles, and you just know that she and Mr Darcy will be blissfully married.  The casting for the whole miniseries was well done.  A lot of attention of was paid to the little details, and that's what makes it so much fun to watch.  I understood Charlotte Lucas a lot better after watching it, though I still feel sorry for her ending up with such a husband.  But as the book said, she knew what she was getting into, and I guess of all the women, she had the best disposition to put up with him.  She might even make him less silly!  :-)<br />For the rest of us, may we all have a Mr Darcy of our own.....  :-)
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie isn't meant to be high-brow entertainment, nor is it overly pretentious (like &quot;The Man Who Wasn't There&quot;).  It's a good adaptation of a comic book, with dialogue that doesn't insult the intelligence of adults, but which can also be enjoyed by younger viewers.
0451167716|5.0|My mom and I love the movie and I thought I'd give the book a try. First off, Mario Puzo is a great author and is ingenious at making the book come to life. The way he so vividly describes events and the characters' thoughts makes it seem like you are actually experiencing them yourself. After the first couple of chapters, you begin to feel certain emotions towards the characters. For example, you may feel hatred towards the 'Turk' Sollozo, lust for the womanizing Santino Corleone (ladies), respect and fear for the great Don, or have pity on young Connie Corleone for her abusive marriage. Each and every character brings something new to the story. The Don is such a strong character. He gains his respect by doing people significant favors, and all he asks for in return is their friendship and for them to help him out whenever he asks for a favor. Despite his harsh reputation, the Don is actually a admirable individual who keeps his word, has strong opinoins and sticks to them. When it comes to the issue of drugs, his views contrast sharply with the opinions of the leaders of the other families. Don Corleone did not want anything to do with drugs, which he felt would be the downfall of the Mafia families. His difference of opinion caused the other heads of the families to turn on him and ultimately contribute to his assassination.<BR>  Puzo's elucidative writing is not the only thing that makes this story so enjoyable...the story itself is part of its vast fame. It is a glimpse at what the Mafia underworld might be like. Like other, more ideal American families, the Corleone family is built on love and trust for eachother and for their close friends. In contrast, their lives are also filled with violence, greed, lies, betrayal, and murder. Sometimes you cannot trust the one's you consider 'family'. Or even though someone in your family may do something against your will, they will be behind your back, sticking up for you, in good times and in bad times. An example ofthis illustrated in the story is the bond between Michael Corleone and his father, Vito. Michael joins the marines against his fathers will. Even though he becomes a war hero, his relationship with his father will never be the same as it was before he left. When the Don is double-crossed and almost shot to death, Michael, who never wanted to get mixed up in his family's illegal affairs, joins in the family 'business' and kills the two men who were behind his father's attack. This is a immense sign of loyalty in that Michael gives up his whole personal life to prevent his father from being targeted any more. <BR>  This story exposes the dark side of the Mafia, and at times, it is hard to distinguish the villian from the hero. This is a well written, entertaining read fot the mature audience.
B00004WGAI|3.0|I have yet to experience via VHS the deep emotional, spiritual journey of the novel. I'm still waiting on the real thing.
B00005JKHP|5.0|\\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\". Say those words and you're bound to get heated, passionate responses from fans, who debate its merits to this day. The detractors (who outweigh the supporters) point to the derivative plot, the pajama-like costumes, the neverending special effects sequences, and the overall boredom and pretentiousness the film evokes. Its supporters counteract by citing the incredible musical score, the amazing quality of the aforementioned effects sequences (which are the best and most creative of any Star Trek film), the intelligence (not pretentious) of its themes--and I would add that contrary to popular opinion, this debut film has plenty of character development, especially for its two main characters Kirk and Spock. The longer TV/VHS edition added many deleted scenes which enhanced those character revelations (including the all-essential moment when Spock is moved to tears at V'Ger's plight, and some humorous moments with Sulu and Uhura). <br />Now, along comes this new Director's edition, which is now the definitive version of the film. It must be noted that many of the film's weaknesses can be attributed to its rush-release, which meant that not only was it not screened in front of a preview audience, but that edits were done on a fly-by-night basis literally days before the film premiered. Wise has stated over the years that it was the only film he ever did which was incomplete, and now over twenty years later he has a chance to complete it. Thus, the upgraded SFX (including sequences which were storyboarded but not included due to time and/or budget restraints), new edits which include many of the added character-driven scenes from the VHS version, and tighter action in other areas. The sound has been reprocessed and the picture (in spite of a few unfortunate blotches here and there, which I suppose could not be corrected) is as crystal clear as it will ever be. The upgraded SFX are *perfectly* matched with the film's original look, and for the first time we get to see what V'Ger looks like without its protective cloud covering. <br />The colors in the DVD are better saturated, making it seem less all-white monochrome; blues, reds, oranges and greens now pop out at the viewer (and I never had a problem with the costumes, which I thought looked rather comfortable!). The film's plot may be derived from TOS' \\"The Changeling\\", but its themes are far more complex and epic; the parallel between Spock's journey and V'Ger's comes to a climax and the change seen here in Spock is THE pivotal moment for his character. Shatner's acting skills as the troubled, obsessive Kirk, are among his most subtle and serious, and his gradual maturation is also a pleasure to behold. Ilia is a graceful and exotic new character who would have made an interesting addition to the Star Trek Phase II series which had been proposed before it turned into this film. <br />I still have several quibbles with the director's edition of the film; a couple of important scenes from the VHS version are still left out (although they are included in the second disc as deleted scenes) and the two main SFX sequences--Kirk's shuttle journey to the Enterprise and the Enterprise's journey into V'Ger--remain overlong (Wise attempts to defend his decision not to cut these in his commentary, which is interesting although not *entirely* convincing). However, I do not see how some reviewers below can say that this edition is a waste of time--with all the care that went into the improved picture, sound, SFX, and in creating an edit which would make the movie flow quicker, it is clear that this is now a highly underrated film that must be looked at a second time. The other features are all first-rate, including a look at the abandoned Phase II series that was going to be Star Trek's return to television (one may also read the fascinating book on the same subject, put out by Paramount).<br />In comparison to the original theatrical release, this Director'sEdition flattens it, hands down. Compared to the long VHS version, it contains nearly all the essential added scenes, and also includes improved SFX, sound and edits, which also makes it superior. If only five minutes more or so had been cut from the two main effects sequences, I think this new edition of the movie would no longer be considered boring at all by the fans, and it's strengths--the awesome score, incredible visuals, complex themes and character development--would be appreciated to their fullest. Apparently, Shatner considered the V'Ger plotline interesting enough to make it a major element of his best-selling Star Trek novel \\"The Return\\", in which we learn that V'Ger's home planet is also the home planet of the Borg. \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" remains one of my very favorite Star Trek films--now at last being given a chance to be seen as it was intended, with most of its potential now fulfilled--a movie that cannot be viewed with a short attention span but if given enough patience, will reveal itself as an epic sci-fi masterpiece. Kirk seen through the glass of his cabin door; Ilia healing Chekov's wound; the agitated, psychedelic color streaks of the wormhole effect; Spock racing down the V'Ger corrider and revealing its secrets; Spock in tears; Ilia and Decker joining as one in an explosion of light and sound; these compelling images remain with you long after the film has ended, and for me along with \\"The Search For Spock\\" it breaks the \\"odds/evens\\" rule of Star Trek films.
0880790121|4.0|Although I give the artist much credit for the minor cards, some of them are astounding beautiful and meaningful. In general, I found this deck too loud in the intensity of the images and facial expressions( the eyes are so gross). Also, the cards have much ornamentation and are much crowded. I have a taste for more simplicity,I  don`t like distracting borders.<br /> In my opinion this deck is valuable in the artistic demonstration of a technique, but not what I feel Tarot is about. I feel left with a void when looking at the images, as if something is missing. Maybe it is me, my perception... as I read other good reviews for this deck.
B000069AUI|5.0|great sophomore effort with a rush of blood to the head.  a little haunting and melancholy at times, but it's layered with driving beats, steady doses of guitar, thoughtful and punctual piano, and melodic, well written vocals.  reminiscient of echo &amp; the bunnymen, the verve, a dash of pink floyd if you will.
B00006F2TV|4.0|I missed seeing this movie in the theaters and couldn't wait for it to hit the video stores so I could see what everyone has been talking about.  I'm not a big fan of CGI effects, so I wasn't buying all the hype about them.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that CGI effects have improved greatly.  Although it is still noticable when a digital actor is performing a stunt, the CGI actors are quite well-done.  I was also pleased to see that many fo the stunts were done by the actors themselves - most especially the fight scenes.  It's nice to see that the makers of this film didn't go overboard with all of the effects, remembering that there has to be some acting and a storyline to make the film worth seeing.<BR>It should be noted that this is not exactly the Spider-man of the Marvel Comics we all read as kids.  The spider that bites Peter Parker is not radioactive in this movie - just bio-engineered.  Some of the story was altered in a way to make this a modernized version of the comic book tale.  Some other things you should know before seeing the movie:  Spidey's web is not manufactured, but a part of his genetically altered self.  The time-frame of the movie requires that the Peter Parker - Mary Jane Watson relationship develops alot faster.  You know there will be sequels, but look how long it took for Parker and Watson to get together in the comics.  <BR>Despite some of the changes made to the original story, I loved this film.  I especially liked seeing a more in-depth look at Mary Jane's life outside of the &quot;in-crowd&quot;.  Tobey Maguire's portrayal as the class-nerd-turned-superhero is excellent.  Kirsten Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.  And what can I say about Willem Defoe's performance as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin?  Superb!  No one will ever top this portrayal of the Green Goblin!  The rest of the cast also does a great job in their roles as well!  <BR>As far as the special items on the DVD, I haven't had the chance to check them all out, but I will say that the gag section was great.  I was only disappointed with the screen tests.  The only true screen test in the buch was J.K. Simmons' reading as J. Jonah Jameson.  The other scenes in this section are really practice scenes, not screen tests.  Otherwise, a great DVD!  You should definitely check it out!

B000002KCV|4.0|With 1971's Harvest, Neil Young had the biggest-selling album of the year, as well as his first and only #1 hit single, Heart of Gold. After the release of this album - due to such factors as the death of close friends, messy relationships, and an agoraphobic reaction to his newfound fame - Young released a series of stark, bleak, depressing albums that alienated his newfound fans and drove his record company up the wall (with them refusing even to release one of the offerings.) It was not until 1978's Comes A Time that Young returned to the gentle, soothing spirit of the Harvest album - and thereby returned into the Top 10. Featuring delicate, peaceful, and soothing songs with Young on acoustic guitar (backed by a plenthora of musicians and Nicolette Larson on vocals), the songs on Comes A Time were some of his most accessible in years, while still maintaining a high level of artistry. The lyrics are some of his strongest, focusing on topics from nature and love to divorce downhome philosophy. Tracks such as Human Highway and Field Of Opportunity focus on Young's unique and enigmatic lyrical approach. Although there are no barnstorming rockers on this album, it features some of his most delicate and moving acoustic work. Several songs feature contributions from an orchestra, and some, such as the title track, have more than a hint of country overtones. Almost as good as Harvest, this comes highly reccommended for fans of that album, it being one of Neil Young's most impressive.
0446310786|4.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a powerful and touching story. The author, Harper Lee, did a wonderful job of telling how young children evolve into young men and women. The novel tells of a small southern town and the dramatic events that change the town forever. To Kill a Mockingbird starts with Scout, a young girl telling about her and her brother Jems summer and the exciting events that occured during it. Scout and Jem were being raised by their widower father Atticus with the help of their housekeeper Clapurnia. Scout and Jem are very curious of the people and happenings in their town. Unpleasant things begin to occur in town though. Atticus, a lawyer, explains that he is defending a young black man, Tom Robinson, who is wrongfully accused of a serious crime. Since this is causing such an uproar, Scout and Jem want to know why he is doing it.<BR>     The writing flowed nicely with the telling of the children's innocent fun to the heart pounding hatred of the trial. During the summer it appears that the children grow up very quickly. In many situations, the kids learn the harsh realities of life. Examples would be when the neighbors house burned down, the trial, getting attacked, and meeting a recluse neighbor for the first time. The neighbors play major parts in this novel. They influence and teach Jem and Scout many things about the way people in the town view each other. This novel really shows how child like innocence can teach adults lessons and how easily it can be lost. To Kill a Mockingbird is an unforgettable novel that is recommended.
B0000025T6|5.0|Touted almost as a commercial suicide at the time of its release, and still occupying a perverse spot in Springsteen's catalog, coming between his commercial breakthrough, The River, and his most popular album, Born In The U.S.A., Nebraska is a dark, bleak, emotionally-draining masterpiece. Springsteen's camp was known for keeping its production internalized, but Bruce truly took that to the extreme here, releasing an album, literally, of home demos - straight off a 4-track cassette recorder, featuring just his voice, guitar, and harmonica. The stories told within the songs are just as bleak and hopeless and the music: Springsteen, who has truly mastered the art of the story song, here began to branch out his lyrics by including truly emphatic sympathetic portraits of small-time criminals, desperate lowlifes, and the ordinary problems faced by ordinary people. This is truly Americana turned inside out - the dark side of the American dream that we often fail to mention or simply choose to forget about. Though the songs lack studio polish - indeed, one feels just as if Bruce were singing to you right off of his back porch - The Boss's vocals perfectly fit the songs: sung well, they complement the bleak lyrics with the Southern-inflected Jersey twang that is distinctly his. Nobody else could have made this album; indeed, Bob Dylan himself praised Springsteen's writing on this album, saying that he himself could never write a song like the title track. High praise, indeed. While the lyrics lack Dylan's poetic sensibility, they reflect and cast back off the true spirit of the real Everyman - who Springsteen is, no doubt, to many of us. Very, very few artists could succeed in this medium - and how many would even dare attempt it just after cracking the commercial market? With this album, Bruce Springsteen established his place as a true artist, in the process creating a masterpiece.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Albeit fictional, this film has raised my curiosity tremendously about Mozart's life.  I have known his music & found the film even more entertaining with his pieces played here & there.<br />F. Abraham played Salieri to perfection, portraying him as a scheming person but not one-dimensional as he was eqaully able to show how muich he respected Mozart's works.  Beneath that jealous ridden individual was a devoted person both to God & to his craft.  T. Hulce wouldn't be outdone being W.A. Mozart, a very gifted musician though quite immaturish in his living.<br />At the end, my heart went to both of them.  For Mozart who did not live to reap the reputation he so deserved & to Salieri for living the rest of his life in guilt.<br />A highly recommended film!
B00006LLLN|5.0|Bought this CD as soon as it came out. The live sound quality is excellent. All of Alison's hits are on this CD, plus other added surprizes. This is a must buy for any fan. The bands musicianship and vocals exceed any other live CD I've heard in a long time. I highly recommend this CD.
B00000099Y|5.0|Jesus christ... a 13 minute epic about acid... the sheer BALLS to do that in the timeframe this album came out... and the quality, richness, and depth of the effort.. .WOW. I listened to it this morning on the way to work.. hadn't heard it in about 6 months... just floated in through the door today. <br />There really is only one group capable of this. <br />All I can say is if you consider yourself to be pretty intellectual and enjoy digging in past the first couple layers, AND like it hard... you gotta get this CD and listen to it about 10 times to start with. Enjoy.
B00004TJFL|3.0|After a superior predecessor (HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS) the fifth instalment proves to be a little dissapointing.  It is at this point that even horror fanatics begin to toy with the question- will HE ever die?  Still though the movie still holds many shocks and scares.  The movie continues straight after Halloween 4 in where Michael presumed dead after being knifed, shot several times, and falling into a mineshaft manages to escape just before the town nuke the place! Fortunately Michael having found refuge is taken in by a hermit.  But, one year later, as soon as he awakens he kills the hermit.  Myers continues to pursue his niece Jamie (Danielle Harris) and he'll do anything to get her.  Donald L.Shanks the man responsible for playing the monster does an excellent job at showing the brutality potential of Michael Myers.  Another element that proves original in the film is the introduction of the emotional Michael of where we discover that he must kill in order to stop the fury in his head.  We are also introduced to the DARKMAN of whom we know nothing about and of whom is more explained in the later sequel.  Halloween 5 pretty much follows it's predecessor in that the same themes are there- Michael hunting down his family members while madman Dr.Loomis plays the protector and the man responsible for possibly killing Myers. However, as with all Halloween films there are many holes such as Myer's house which seemed to have gone under a chrysallis formation.  Once a two storey house, now it has become a mansion.<BR>Apart from plotgaps and acting this film is quite an average yet worthy sequel to the now stale Halloween series.
B000063NPX|5.0|This story is very touching and true if you understand it at it's core. Essentially this film shows the true meaning of what is the most and perhaps the only real important thing in everybody's life. Althought it seems to be a children movie, there is a lot to be learned from the adult viewer as well. As far as video quality goes, the picture is sharper, brighter and cleaner than the original tape but the colors tend to be less vivid and toward the brown/red spectrum. The picture in the original vhs edition is not as sharp but it has more depth and better color fidelity which gives it a more filmlike appearance. The audio quality of the new version is disappointing. The overall soundtrack is less bright and not as loud as the original version. Overall I am keeping both versions, the new one for the extra footage and the old one for better quality sound and somewhat better video. This comparisons are based on vhs vs. vhs version of the movie.

B00005JKDR|5.0|This movie is so funny. This is the greatest movie ever. If you thought that this was a movie for only little 5 year old kids, you were wrong. This is such a great movie, it's great for all ages. There is even a sceen stolen from the movie &quot;Predator.&quot;
B000002UAI|2.0|the bad standard bands album was recorded after a hard days night in that same year 64. This one is recorded in mono only not stereo!!! their albums from 1967 - 1970 were good.....but this one is absolutely tame & weak!<BR>Check out other better rock bands albums like deep purple live and studio albums, they are much much better than this one.
B000002UAC|2.0|The Beatles, as many pop groups do, could not match their debut masterpiece. This one is a lightweight album. We all know that the group had years of club playing in Hamburg to develop their early stuff. You should know that Lennon &amp; co were big fans of Elvis Presley, they wanted to do like him. And then they were doing the cover versions of American Rock and Roll they could play in their sleep. My humble opinion, this album is absolutely tame! <br />PS: Hey the beatles was not alone in the music world. Please check out other better rock bands like Led Zeppelin or Deep purple! their studio &amp; Live albums are more rocking....believe me!
B000002MTU|4.0|I bought this while i was at a store with my mom today, and I was not in the least bit disappointed... Maybe a little bit with the vocals, but the musicianship is superb and flawless...Old Slowhand has always been a blues musician so this album does not surprise me at all.... If you have been a Clapton die-hard since the sixties, you'll probably like this CD, as it features many early blues tracks....
B00003CXXM|5.0|after the Ludlum novels (including the novel of the movie title) I was skeptical about this movie, particularly after the awful attempt by Richard Chamberlain. If ever an actor captured Jason Bourne, it is Matt Damon and he has done a fine job of this role with the result that this is a gripping and suspenseful movie in its own right, regardless of the books. Throughly recommended. But. Jason Bourne. Still it remains impossible to transfer to film the thoughts going on inside his head, and it is these that make the whole premise of the Bourne stories scarier. Certainly the CIA (or whichever department of dirty tricks is 'running' the operative known as Bourne) are not so sure who he is..but Bourne himself has no idea. It is his own fear, generated from this lack of certainty that remains 'missing' from the story on film. Capture that and the whole Bourne storyline throughout all the books (and please can we have sequels. This movie is certainly good enough for more..) will fit into place on the screen.
B000001ELF|5.0|Even though Ace Frehley had actually only SUNG one song prior to the release of this solo album (which easily outsold his other KISS mates' efforts), there was no question that he provided the KISS \\"sound\\" on most of their albums. Remember, he had penned such KISS classics as \\"Parasite\\", \\"Strange Wayz\\" (both off of Hotter Than Hell, 1974), \\"Cold Gin\\" (KISS debut, 1973), and \\"Getaway\\" (Dressed To Kill, 1975) so the only natural step he had to take was to actually do the vocals. The song-writing talent and arrangements were there. And wow...does Ace deliver big time here. Every song is strong, with a lot of the credit having to also do with the expertise of producer Eddie Kramer, who historically has always gotten the best out of Ace. <BR>Honestly, Ace's voice isn't great, but it sounds pretty good on these tracks, with his rendition of Russ Ballard's \\"New York Groove\\" the only single from the four solo albums to chart in the top 40 in 1978. Check out \\"Snow Blind\\" and \\"Ozone\\" (which has been covered by the Foo Fighters, believe it or not!)for some way-out-there bridge work and lay back and relax to \\"Fractured Mirror\\", one of the best rock instrumentals in my opinion. Ace is my favorite lead guitarist, and on this album, he does it all!
B00006JSS8|4.0|For the casual fan, this single-disc, 80-minute collection hits nearly all the highlights. [Serious fans will already have the individual albums or 1999's essential At the Close of the Century box set--or at the very least 1996's 31-track Song Review: Greatest Hits.] Since this latest anthology collects only the hits, it begins with Wonder's first No. 1 hit, 1963's &quot;Fingertips (Part 2),&quot; and concludes with &quot;Overjoyed&quot; from 1985's In Square Circle, which also included his last No. 1 hit, &quot;Part-Time Lover.&quot;<br />The tracks are presented chronologically, allowing listeners to hear Wonder's progression from teen pop star to the mature artist that made him one of the most influential artists of the seventies with tracks like &quot;Superstition,&quot; &quot;I Wish,&quot; &quot;Sir Duke&quot; and &quot;Living for the City,&quot; the latter presented in all its 7:25 album length glory.<br />I don't miss the exclusion of his duet with Paul McCartney on &quot;Ebony and Ivory,&quot; but with no fewer than eight Top 10 singles missing from this collection, why include &quot;Hey Love&quot; (the b-side of &quot;Travlin' Man&quot;) instead of &quot;A Place in the Sun,&quot; &quot;Heaven Help Us All&quot; or &quot;If You Really Love Me&quot;?  [Note:  There is an import version that adds another disc and 17 songs, but it's a bit pricey.]<br />All in all, if what you're looking for is a collection of Wonder's biggest hits on a single disc at a great price, this is what you've been waiting for.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00006GFAB|4.0|Overall, the 21 selections on this CD are strong. However, I am always dismayed to find that Ace's work is always overlooked when compiling these greatest hits packages (which KISS has done time and time again). Where's &quot;Shock Me&quot; or &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;? Both of these tunes deserve to be on here more than say &quot;Hotter Than Hell&quot; or &quot;Christine Sixteen&quot;. I'm pretty sure the exclusion of Ace's work has more to do with Paul and Gene not wanting to pay him any additional royalties...but if that's the case, than they are short-changing the casual KISS fan who just wants a greatest hits CD and picks this up. If you are one of those fans and are reading this...I suggest picking up these three ESSENTIAL KISS albums...1. ALIVE!, 2. Destroyer, and 3. Ace Frehley (the best of the four solo albums released in 1978).
B00005JL2O|1.0|Really now, I haven't stopped blaming myself for watching this senseless film & wasting my time.  They are definitely running out of ideas.  It has a very shallow plot (I am being generous here, it should be plotless actually), crude jokes which are not funny at all & lousy characters.  I am surprised why Michael Cane decided to join this cast.<br />Goldmember is not something worth watching for..neither in the theaters nor rented discs.  Please spare yourself from such absurdity.
B00005K3NR|5.0|CARRIE is one of my favorite horror flicks, so there isn't anything bad I can say about this. The dvd is a nice package, with lots of extra tidbits. The movie is fabulous...scary, disturbing....Piper Laurie as Carrie's mother is amazingly evil.
6304504012|5.0|11/06/02 Evita is an excellent movie..where the expression &quot;There are no small parts,just 'bit actors' is proven with nothing but excellents running through every second of film by all(speaking as well as non-speaking parts),and the music is hypnotic....Although Madonna's role as the teen Evita was a little off casting...her excellent acting saved the day on those few scenes and she evolved through the rest of the movie magnificently...Banderos had no challenging scenes..He as well as the 'new' actor wh played &quot;Peron&quot; were not outdone...I own the video and have view it many times.
B00005R87Q|4.0|they did a good job but they have some things that just are not right. two nitrous systems on one car, double clutching what are these guys driving semis or something.<BR>i like the action scenes and they got some nice cars but man do they have some &quot;ricey&quot; cars. i think that the movie was good for being the first one out on this subject. <BR>i think its a great movie for the winter time when we cant go out and race!<BR>well just see how many stupid ppl come out and see the second one because all of a sudden to many dumb ppl have been coming out with there neon kits and thinking there cars are fast!
B00006J3WH|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing. I am not going to try to sound like an overly pretentious music reviewer. I am telling you like it is. This soundtrack is really good. True without the dialouge its a little hard to grasp the full intesity that the songs potray but even without them you can get the general idea that there was a lot of pain, love and laughter expressed by the characters and the actors. The best song on the soundtrack hands down belongs to Amber Benson/Anthony Stewart Head with their duet &quot;Under Your Spell/Standing Reprise&quot;. The song is simply amazing. Of course the next best song is &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; and the simply awesome &quot;Walk through the Fire&quot;. If you are a true fan of Buffy's this soundtrack will more than make up for the disaster known as season six and even if you're not, the songs are comical sometimes as well as moving. Well that is my review. Take my word for its definetely worth it!

B00005JKCH|5.0|And I don't mean that as an insult.  Chick flicks are well known for dealing with the internals of the characters, and if there's one thing that SPIDER-MAN excels at it's giving us a look at what's going on in the hearts of everyone in the film.<br />I've never seen a superhero film where everyone is so human, so in that way, Raimi carries on the tradition of the original comic book series--the tragedy of a young hero with feet of clay.<br />As a long-time comic reader, I viewed this movie with some trepidation--as much confidence as I had in Raimi the director, I still had to recognize that this one was a Major Hollywood Blockbuster, with Major Hollywood Money and Major Hollywood Politics behind it. After seeing what impact those forces had on the Batman and Superman franchises, I just couldn't help worrying.<br />I shouldn't have been the least bit concerned: Raimi, Dunst, and--most of all--Maguire deliver knock-out punches on every level.  Peter Parker is so much the nerd that even the nerdy girls won't let him sit next to them on the bus, MJ Watson is the popular girl from a dysfunctional family with an ache in her heart, and everyone--even the bad guy--garners sympathy from the audience.<br />In many ways, this is a story about pain, grief, loss, and the hope that can blossom from them. It spends as much time on the dark side of humanity as it does in the four-color world of superheroes, and even the hero's motivations aren't always noble.<br />Everyone in this film cares for someone, and everyone pays the price for doing so. The story ends on a maginficent note that is at once tragic and hopeful, and if there's ever a movie that had me ready for a sequel, this is it.  It stands as one of my &quot;had to watch it again, immediately&quot; landmark films.<br />If anyone wants to know how superhero movies should be done, they should call Sam Raimi.  With this film, he establishes himself as the foremost expert in the genre.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Let me just say that I almost didn't buy this CD because of the negative 'Editorial Review' on Amazon.com.  <br />John Mayer is a breath of fresh air.  A break-out artist.  I bought this CD despite the (negative) review printed here and was greatly surprised by its ability to awaken familiar feelings in my soul.  One can really relate to the lyrics.  <br />This is one of those CDs that you play from beginning to end and then play it all over again.  Almost every track is a winner.  'My Stupid Mouth' hit me right where I live as well as 'Love Song For No One'.  Each track seems to have a well thought out story behind it.  <br />GOOD WORK John Mayer!  This is a fantastic group of songs.
6304696566|5.0|In 1955, John Ford went to Monument Valley to film what has since become his western masterpiece, \\"The Searchers\\". This scenic American backdrop was the perfect setting for this atmospheric story. In this film, John Wayne turns in his greatest performance as Ethan Edwards, an ex rebel soldier returning home from the Civil War under mysterious circumstances. However, his homecoming is short lived, as Reverend Samuel Clayton and his band of Texas Rangers recruit him and his adopted nephew, Martin Pawley to repel a party of Comanche Indians (Or Native Americans for the politically correct) from the neighboring ranches. Unfortunately, the raiders kill Ethan's brother and beloved sister-in-law, in addition to capturing his nieces Lucy and little Debbie. After setting out after the marauders, Ethan quickly clashes with Reverend Clayton, who questions him on his harsh tactics in fighting Comanches. In a desire to employ aggressive measures, Edwards leaves the larger group with Martin Pawley and Lucy's betrothed, Brad Jorgensen, growling, that \\"he is giving the orders.\\" While hot on the path of the raiding party, Ethan notices that several Comanche's have split off from the trail. Urging Marty and Brad to wait, the older man goes to investigate the broken tracks of four riders. In a brilliantly acted scene, Wayne's character Ethan comes down the canyon and digs his hunting knife into the sand. Shaken to his core, the Confederate veteran has just discovered the mutilated corpse of his beautiful niece Lucy. Edwards initially keeps this grisly discovery to himself. When Marty asks the older man about his missing rebel coat, a dazed Ethan tells him that he \\"has lost it.\\" Later that evening, the three men locate the Indian camp and Brad mistakenly believes that he sees Lucy wearing her favorite blue dress. Ethan then tells the excited young man that it is in fact a Comanche buck wearing Lucy's dress. When Brad insists he has seen Lucy, Edwards informs him that he buried her body back at the canyon, wrapped inside of his missing coat. In an act of suicidal rage, Jorgensen runs into an Indian camp to share Lucy's fate. For the next five years, Ethan and Marty myopically hunt for young Debbie, who is the captive of a Comanche chief named Scar. Along the way, Ethan manages to dispatch bushwhackers and Marty breaks up the wedding of his childhood sweetheart, in a scene brimming with comic relief. Finally, the two men rejoin Captain Clayton and his Texas Rangers to take on the Comanche's in a climatic battle, where the long-suffering Debbie is eventually rescued. For this film, the seasoned director assembled a cast of his regulars, including Ken Curtis, John Qualen, Hank Worden and Harry Carey Jr. This bunch turns in the kind of solid character acting that moviegoers came to expect from a John Ford vehicle. Ward Bond is superb as Captain Clayton and delivers some of the film's most amusing dialogue. Additionally, a lovely, teenage Natalie Wood has about five minutes of screen time playing the older Debbie. However, at the center of this great movie, is the relationship between the two searchers, played by Wayne and ably supported by Jeffery Hunter, who must ride together day after endless day in their search for the elusive Chief Scar. The chemistry between these two actors makes this film a classic of the western genre.back at the canyon, wrapped inside of his missing coat.

B00005RFAI|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for two weeks now and I just can't stop.  The last CD I bought that I listened to this much was No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom.<br />Every single song is memorable and interesting.  Most of them are just downright fun.  I have to stop myself from singing along.
0471413909|2.0|It is a shame that Loren Cordain who has undoubted scientific ability has fallen into the trap of the fat/cholesterol hypothesis.  This completely unsupportable hypothesis (and it has never ever been more than an hypothesis) is a poor vehicle to show off his interesting research on the paleolithic diet.  The credibility of the book is further compromised by his clear lack of knowledge about edible fat composition and cellular biology and the importance of both saturated fats and polyunsaturated fats (together with cholesterol) in the generation and maintenance of cell integrity, not to mention hormone manufacture.<br />The tables that purport to show relative food values (eg protein and or fat values) are highly suspect and do not match any of the standard references I have consulted.  The values are usually wildly astray, some laughably so (if it was'nt so serious).  What the source of these tables are is never specified.<br />As for recommending flax oil for cooking!!!<br />Reading this book made me feel sad for Cordain and his colleagues who have compromised the value of their research by slipshod thinking and sloppy research outside of their main field of interest.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The Band of Brothers is a TV miniseries following the lives of the 101st Airborne's Easy Company during World War Two. There are depictions of D-Day, Normandy, Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge(Bastogne), and many more. Not only do they show the fighting and all the action of those times, the main focus was centred in on the emotions on the soldiers. Whether it is a loss of a friend, a cold winter morning in the 'foxholes', trench foot, brutal amputations and surgeries, the guilty conscience after a victory, or shortages of food supplies, medical supplies(bandages, morphine, plasma), or other utensils, each emotion is displayed powerfully and realitically so that it dominates the entire show...<br />Definately is the best WW2 depiction of all time and is a must see for war movie watchers...(Warning: Contains intense violence, blood and gore, and occaisional strong language)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|My kids are at an age where they HAVE seen this film in the past, but they didn't remember it.  We watched it together after it came in and they loved it.  Even my 12 year old son watched it on his own again the next day.<br />I wouldn't have thought the animation could be improved from the original, but it has!  It blows the mind to see this quality.  Not to mention that the storyline and musical score have always been superb as well.<br />This is the triumph of Disney animation!  I wish all DVDs were this good!
B00006G8LB|5.0|This is such an awsome movie. I suggest that everyone should watch this movie. Tobb Maguire did a great job as Spider-man. They also followed the comic scribt very closely. It was a joy for the whole family.
014017821X|5.0|I first read this book in college and it has become one of my all-time favorites. In this collection of short stories, Angela Carter takes the fairytales, nursery rhymes, and the images and themes they contain and perverts/illuminates them. What is most striking about this collection is Carter's writing style. Her language is simultaneously poetic and profane. The stories are heavy with her purple language, which is what makes them so satisfying to read. In additon to the exquisite language, Carter's re-telling of classic tales such as \\"Snow White,\\" \\"Red Riding Hood,\\" \\"Puss in Boots,\\" etc., never fails to pay off. Carter creates a world in which Red Riding hood is the savvy hunter, not the innocent hunted. These stories make us focus on the overly simplistic (and often slanted) messages we were taught as children when these tales were first presented to us. In particular, Carter makes us question what fairytales have taught us about gender roles, marriage, and sex. For a trip into the fantasic that will make you laugh and make you really THINK, read this book!
B00005221M|1.0|This DVD is a huge disappointment. With every other movie I have ever bought that was labeled a \\"Director's Cut\\" or an \\"Expanded Edition\\", the movie had things added to it and not taken out. This version of the movie cuts out much of the familiar and favorite dialogue from the movie released in the theater. Did you like the part where, hiding in the forest, Hawkeye & Cora have their conversation about her people being a breed apart and not making any sense? When Cora gets offended by this, Hawkeye gives her such a look and says \\"I would make an exception in your case, Miss\\" and she sarcastically says \\"Thank you so much!\\" All this is ripped out of this version.  When Major Hayward and Hawkeye have their confrontation in Col. Munro's office about whether the Colonial militia should be released from service to defend their families, gone is the part where Hawkeye looks at the Major and says \\"I think one day you and I are going to have a serious disagreement\\".  When the party is escaping from the massacre and are in the canoes on the lake, gone is the part where Hawkeye sees Major Hayward pointing a gun at him and says \\"Got nothing better to do on the lake today, Major?\\" When the party is hiding from the Hurons in the cave behind the waterfall there are some scenes and dialogue missing. Most notably when Hawkeye and Uncas and Chingachgook decide they have to flee and Cora says \\"I want you to go, that way if the worst happens and only one of us survives, then something of the other does too.\\" <BR>   This DVD can be credited with adding a few tiny bits of dialogue here and there but very little of it adds anthing to the story and does not make up for the lines that were cut. There are also some added shots of the backside of horses as they pull a coach, a few extra shots of the crowd leaving Ft. William Henry and a few extra shots of the French soldiers digging the trenches. They are not worth shelling out money for a DVD if you already have the VHS version. The only thing of real merit added in this version are shots of Major Hayward's diversion outside Ft. William Henry while Hawkeye and Uncas are covering the escape of the courier that is being sent to get reinforcements from General Webb at Ft. Edward. If they had just added that and left the rest alone, it would have been a tiny improvement.<BR>   If you look at the original VHS tape of the theatrical release you will find the length recorded as 114 minutes.  The length of this newly released, expanded edition is -- now get ready to be overwhelmed -- 117 minutes. This DVD is simply a major rip-off by a film company trying to get some money from extra movie sales.  Unfortunately, they do not have the material to make it worth your while. Take my advice, Save Your Money!!
B00004VWA7|5.0|I honestly cannot praise this album enough. Although each song has a different personel and a completely different feel, the whole album feels like one concise unit, making it hard to name a standout track.<br />&quot;Donna Lee&quot;- a glorius, and pretty damn hip, intro to the record. Just a duet with percussionist Don Alias.<br />&quot;Come On, Comne Over&quot;- written by Jaco and Bob Herzog, who was originally supposed to do the vocals. Famous for featuring Sam &amp; Dave and Jaco's ultra-funky 16th-note groove.<br />&quot;Continuum&quot;- a beautiful composition featuring Alias and the great Herbie Hancock. Herbie's electric piano (fender rhodes) playing is a great compliment to Jaco's singing bass.<br />&quot;Kuru/Speak Like A Child&quot;- a jazzy tune propelled by a string section and Herbie's fantastic acoustic piano playing. Like &quot;Cha-Cha&quot;, Hancock is integral to this tune. Oh, and the bass ain't bad either.<br />&quot;Portrait Of Tracy&quot;- a beautiful bass solo by Jaco. Filled with harmonics, learning this song is a rite of passage for aspiring bassists.<br />&quot;Opus Pocus&quot;- a calypso-tinged jam featuring steel pans player Othello Molineux and Weathe rReport saxist Wayne Shorter. An awesome tune.<br />&quot;Okonkole Y Trompa&quot;- tasteful percussion, Jaco's propeller-like bass figure, and a solemn French horn turn this into a track much like &quot;Contuinuum&quot;. Just a nice ensemble of players.<br />&quot;(Used To Be A) Cha-Cha&quot;- dominated by Hancock's piano playing (acoustic), it also features some heavy flute and clavinet work by Hubert Laws, and some sweet solos by Jaco. <br />&quot;Forgotten Love&quot;- Herbie is the star of the show in this finale, as Jaco does not perform. A beautiful way to end the original album.<br />The bonus tracks are also interesting. While the retake of &quot;Cha-Cha&quot; may only thrill fans, the brand-new &quot;6/4 Jam&quot; is a treat to all, with it's funky bass and distinctive time signature (which is obviously 6/4). <br />All, this record is not just for bass players. It's not just for jazz fans. It's not just for breakfast anymore. This is an album where music lovers of all kinds can come and appreciate the talents of one man: John Francis Anthony Pastorius III. Or, simply call him JACO.
B00006AFUR|3.0|What do John Travolta, William Shatner and Jared Leto have in common? They are all well-known actors who have (for better or for worse) entered the music business. One of these actors' music is actually listenable, and I'll give you only one guess as to who that is.<br />30 Seconds to Mars is the brainchild of movie-star Jared Leto (Requiem For A Dream, Panic Room) and his brother, Shannon. No doubt, a lot of the music on here draws heavy comparison to Tool. Now, even though 30STM couldn't even touch that which Tool have accomplished, they are still more than worthy of your attention. Jared Leto has a nice, cool, smooth voice that far exceeded my expectations for his vocal abilities. His vocals are complimented very nicely by the brash electronic landscapes that are painted by the surrounding music (It is good to note that 30STM are simply composed of Jared and Shannon, with a full band for live shows). On one of my favorite songs, \\"Welcome To The Universe,\\" Deadsy frontman Elijah Blue (stage-name: P. Exeter Blue) puts down some guitar work. I think that they are a perfect collaboration, and I would like to see the two bands tour together. However, there are some downsides to this CD, for starters, it is way too over-produced. At times, this CD feels a bit cold and mechanical and just a little carried away with the technology. Also, a lot of the songs sound like carbon-copies of each other. BUT, with 2002 being such a good year for new bands compared to 2001, you should not worry about picking this one up. As long as you don't hold your standards up too high, it satisfies.
B00006L83N|5.0|'The Odyssey' is a masterpiece. It even surpasses the albums 'The divine wings of tragedy' and 'V'. It is definitely not the most accessible Symphony X album, but after a few listens all pieces of this ingenious musical puzzle fall into place. It is a wonderful musical journey through different soundscapes with wild bends and turns and full of unexpected encounters. It is truly a musical 'Odyssey'. <BR>The musicianship is, as usual, unequalled. Be it the tasteful high octane drumming of Rullo, the heavy bass playing of Lepond or the wonderful (sometimes very atmospherical) pieces of piano or keyboard playing by Pinella, the result is always nothing short of amazing. Special attention on this one to Michael Romeo, who besides being the main composer,an excellent producer and a fantastic guitar player (combining brilliant heavy metal riffs with over-the-edge neoclassical and Holdsworth influenced solos) is also very effective when composing orchestral parts. Special attention also to Allen whose voice has never sounded more diverse. From the ferocious growls on 'Inferno' to the softer edged singing on 'Awakenings', I think no current metal vocalist could surpass the achievement of Allen on this CD. <BR>If you buy only one metal CD this year, make sure it's this one.
B00005YUPO|5.0|My daughter loved this video, along with the Baby Doolittle as she got a little older. She wasn't much of a sleeper early on, and this was a great way to keep her entertained and stimulated, while giving me a few minutes to do a few things around the house. I never felt guilty about her watching a video, as it included classical music and calming movement, vs. some of the other loud, visually blasting videos also on the market. She now has a love of music at 2 years, and seems most riveted to classical tunes. I give it to all my new mom friends as a shower gift!
B000005JA8|1.0|Forget the \\"spotlight\\" reviews - they're obviously incredibly self-serving.  This CD is, simply put, the worst CD I've ever heard.  It has no redeeming qualities, not as an influence, not as interesting or avant-garde, not as a post-modernist experiment, it just sticks.  What is even more disappointing is the fact that people fall all over themselves trying to convince you that it's great.  It's not.  Don't waste your time on pretentious jokes like this.
0316666343|5.0|This is a spiritual journey of sorts that takes you through your whole range of emotions.  Fortunately, it ends with an uplifting message of hope.  Another spiritual journey I recommend is &quot;I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You&quot;.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I bought this DVD with very high expectations. The movie fulfiled my expectations, it certainly is one of the best comic hero movies out there.<br />BUT ...<br />I was disappointed with the audio in this DVD. I was demonstrating my new Subwoofer to a friend when I first viewed this. We sampled Lord of the rings before this DVD and the difference in sound quality was unbelievable. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack on this DVD is just terrible. It sounds very artificial, hollow, lifeless, no use of surround back speakers. There is no execuse for a lame release like this, specially for a new movie. I bought this thinking that it will have reference Audio and Video. I was wrong and am very disappointed.<br />I am sure that there will be a re-release of this DVD with DTS and all the works (hopefully a better sound mix). If I did not happen to already have this DVD, I would wait for the Special Edition.<br />Skip this one. Wait for the special edition if you can.
B0000683DH|5.0|As a viewer that prefers the original cast films (and TV shows), I am unapologetic about calling Star Trek II the greatest Trek film, and with the passing of Deforest Kelly, it will remain the greatest.  It has everything Trek fans could want: a great villain, space battles, morality conflicts, humour, and, of course, William Shatner chewing up the scenery.  <br />The best \\"Original Series\\" shows contained a mixture of philosophy and action, both of which are readily apparent here.  The story: The exiled Khan escapes by hijacking a starship, then sets out to revenge himself on Kirk.  Along the way he learns of the Genesis Project, basically a super-fast terraforming process that would render lifeless worlds habitable in mere days.  The problem - if used where life already exists, it would wipe out that life and rearrange it to fit its new pattern (this is why the Klingons come after it in ST III).  The action follows Khan's parallel schemes to kill Kirk while stealing the Genesis device.  The philosophy arises from Spock and McCoy's debates on the merits of the Genesis Project, as well as Kirk coming to terms with aging (he gets reading glasses and meets his now-adult son who hates him).<br />The acting is what you'd expect from the likes of Ricardo Montalbahn and William Shatner - emoting galore!  But it works because director Meyer has arranged the film as a melodramatic space opera.  Meyer also includes some nice touches, such as piping aboard flag officers, standardised uniforms, and other naval touches.  Curiously, the two antagonists never meet in the flesh (and therefore the actors never worked together); perhaps this is more realistic: after all, Villeneuve and Nelson never went 1-on-1 at Trafalger.  Thus, Meyer's fusion of age-of-sail naval fighting with science fiction has a neat feel of authenticity.  Finally, the score is probably the best of the ST films.<br />This DVD edition is certainly worthy of the quality of the film.  There are numerous extras, from documentaries on the effects and set designs, to the fascinating text commentary by Jan Okuda.  Meyer lends some nice insight in his audio commentary as well, although he sounds more like a scriptwriter (which he also does, but not on this film) than a director.  With a cost that is little more than a normal DVD, it's also great value.  But the absolute highlight is the suit that Leonard Nimoy is wearing in the extra \\"Original Cast Interviews.\\"  It has to be seen to be believed!

6305841861|5.0|The movie itself is great, a wonderful blend of the innovative special effects that made The Evil Dead such a great movie and comic stunts that show up again in Army of Darkness, making this film a bridge between two extremes.  <BR>The video and audio are as good as they'll ever be, I get such a kick out of the THX logo popping up after only seeing it on Star Wars VHS's.  The extras seem slim at first, but after going through them, you realize they're all you need, and then some stuff you don't really care about, like the comercial for the computer game.  But the rest is great.  The commentary with Campbell, Raimi and crew was fantastic.  The 'making of' featurette was really good, I'm so glad someone on set had a camcorder.  <BR>After going through this DVD you will gain a true understanding of how it was made, and how everyone felt in making it, which is a rare thing in DVD's, even with big budget films that release DVD's that have next to nothing on them.
0440219078|5.0|After reading The Giver, I was amazed at how the setting, thoughts, and characters all interacted to spin the story that you can't put down. It appears to be a perfect future with no hunger, no war, no pain, and the awareness that all was well. Based on things in everyday life, The Giver focuses on the life of Jonas, a boy that lives in an environment of peace, rules, structure, equality, and seeming perfection. But when given the title as The Receiver of Memory, Jonas begins to see his family, their life, and their world differently. Jonas leads the reader on a journey of self-discovery that forces you to think of how you, your life, and your beliefs are shaped. It is this journey that leads Jonas to question everything and find that all of life is not as we grow up believing. This book was great; it never stopped raising questions--some answered, some not. By seeing the world through Jonas's eyes, you can not help but see your own life differently and know that some questions have no answers, but we must always keep asking.
0060254920|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorites ever!  If you've never read this book then you're really missing out.  It's a great \\"look mommy I can read\\" type of book.  Also, it really brings out the creative side of kids.  <BR>     It's about a boy named Max that puts on his wolf suit and gets into lots of mischief.  His mom calls him wild and he tells her that he is going to eat her so she sends him to his room without any supper.  His room then turns into a jungle and he travels months and months to where the wild things are.  They all show their fangs and growl and he doesn't get scared at all.  They then make him their king and they play together.  Max then realizes that he'd rather be at home where he knows that the people around him love him.  He goes back home and supper is waiting for him.  And it's still hot.<BR>     Not only is this book interesting, but it also has a message.  When things happen that you want to, they may not be what you really want.  Go do something nice for yourself and read this book with your children.  Or have your children read it to you. I highly recamend this book.
B00005OC0G|2.0|This concerto is one of my favorite pieces of music, so I was very much looking forward to hearing this recording.  Alas, I was disappointed.<br />In the interview accompanying the CD, Ms Mutter notes that this concerto is not a &quot;virtuoso&quot; composition, and thus she selected the Kreisler cadenzas in order to lend a more virtuoso character to her rendition of the piece.  This was a mistake: the weakest part of the recording is the first movement, in which the hardest parts, which I assume are the cadenzas, sound scratchy. Indeed, she sounds as though her violin has laryngitis.  <br />Overall, Ms Mutter ignores what Beethoven wanted and plays with a heavy hand.  Certainly parts of the concerto call for loud and vigorous playing, but uniformly to play the concerto that way does violence to the intent of the composer.  Parts of the concerto should be played with a light touch, something of which Ms Mutter seems incapable, at least in this piece.<br />A disappointing outing.  This concerto, probably the greatest violin concerto ever written, deserves a soloist who focuses on Beethoven, and not on whether the piece is sufficiently difficult to warrant serious attention.  It is more than difficult enough--in fact, it is just right.
0385508417|1.0|A Grisham fan, I looked forward to a different style of novel from him.  What I found was an interesting premise but a really mean story.  I found the characters hypocritical - those who were &quot;in the spirit&quot; demanded conformity from all and terrorized those who didn't.  Without missing too much, I skipped a chunk of the story in the middle and read the ridiculous ending.  Unfortunately, it was as slapstick as any &quot;Christmas Vacation&quot; movie and as unbelievable.  The only skipping I would recommend is this book altogether.
B00005YW4H|4.0|After hearing &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on the radio many times, and finding it creeping comfortably under my skin, when a co-worker loaned me a copy of Jones' CD, I was anxious to give it a listen.  I was not disappointed, but found it a promise fulfilled.  In time when too much music consists of wailing vocals backed by a drum machine and wrapped in studio production, Jone's soft voice, minimalist setting and delicate phrasing are a refreshing change of pace.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because while there are moments when I found myself wishing that a few more risks were taken here and there with settings and material choice.  The original material is good, but doesn't quite stand up to the covers here which show what incredible things Jones can do with a truly great song.  As one reviewer said, what shines here is not just talent but potential.  If Jones does some close listening to artists like Billie Holiday, Shirley Horne and Nina Simone, and manages to distill what makes each of them great without taking the easier route of mere imitation, she will be an artist to watch for some time to come.  In the meantime, her first offering shows great talent and tremendous promise.
0345448898|5.0|This is my absolute favorite trilogy ever. I love Lord of the Rings, which I read previous to 'His Dark Materials'.  Of course the Rings are a classic.  The basis for most fantasy books.  However, there is something truly unique about this particular fantasy trilogy.  It's very postmodern.  A book where you can't quite distinguish whether it should be for children or adults.  But, in a good way. It is a wonderful combination of a fantasy that is brillantly whimsical and childlike, but it is not condescending to a young person's understanding of life.  It is a wonderful coming of age trilogy.  Great for age 11 and up. It is a MUST read, whether you agree with the criticisms or not.  It is something that you have just got to read for yourself. It is heartbreakingly beautiful.  My husband even cried at the end.  I did too, but I can't figure if it was because of the story, or because it had to end!<br />P.S. PLEASE ignore the previous review that makes comentary on christianity.  They were burning Harry Potter books in parts of the world because they though that the \\"magic\\" was satanic.  If you are going to read a fantasy, understand it is a FANTASY.  We need to enjoy ourselves and not read so much into whether an author meant to make a commentary on religion or not.  Books are to enjoy and you certainly will enjoy this one.  Let your imagination run wild!  It's a great one!
0345448898|5.0|I see a number of people comparing this series to the Harry Potter books, when in fact they are not at all alike. Where Potter falls into the 'shallow adventure' category, the Pullman books harken back to when children's literature had a great deal to say. One reader referred to it as 'a polemic against the church,' and I leave it to you to determine if this is the case - I certainly found my breath taken away as the scale and scope of the story was revealed in the third book. His Dark Materials has an awful lot to say, and certainly isn't the candy-coated drivel so much of children's literature is today. It does have larger goals, and you may not agree with what's being said, but isn't that what literature is supposed to be about?
0028643151|5.0|I do not normally read books of this genre, however, due to recent world events I thought it would be a great read as well as a way to familiarize myself with all that is going on.  The author did a fantastic job of describing very scientific and complex terms and theories in such a way that I was able to grasp each concept extraordinarily well.  The book is a page turner from start-to-finish!  I highly recommend DOOMSDAY; it is well researched, exciting, and informative.  It is also a great read for those who are unfamiliar with scientific terminology.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash could sing nursery rhymes and sell albums because of his voice.  However, this album is wonderful for a number of reasons.  First of all, the covers.  When Cash covers a song, you can tell he feels it.  His cover of Nine Inch Nails &quot;Hurt&quot; is more heartfelt and better than the original - and I like the original. Depeche Mode cover &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; is also great.  It stars Red Hot Chili Pepper John Fruciante on guitar and its really energetic. In the midsts of all the covers perhaps the best song on this album is &quot;Sam Hall.&quot;  It rings true Johnny Cash.  Written by Cash himself, it's reminiscent of his classic prison songs and tunes about robbers, murderers and theives.  It will also make you laugh.  This album is great, and if you're like me and can't get enough Cash, you'll want to buy this.
0312265859|4.0|While this book still serves up plenty of drools and laughs, Evanovich has upped the ante in this one with some hard edges and a bit more menace.  Evanovich also manages to turn up the heat as well with even more Ranger.  Evanovich's writing is fluid and smooth with a great balance between the usual craziness that is Stephanie's life and the more sinister characters and situations she's put in.
0812548094|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read, the writing is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This book like the rest of the sword of truth series is very good and if you liked robert jordons wheel of time series, or any of R.A. Salvators books, then this is a must read series.
0156711427|5.0|This tantalizing question provides the intense drama at the centre of Forster's last and greatest novel, which explores racial tension in colonial India.<BR>After a mysterious incident during their visit to the Marabar Caves, the charming Dr Aziz is accused of assaulting Adela Quested, a naive young Englishwoman. As he is brought to trial the fragile structure of Anglo-Indian relations collapses and the racism inherent in colonialism is exposed - a theme which still has powerful, dangerous realities today.
B000002MTR|5.0|Sure, the Red Hot Chili Peppers had a different sound on this CD, but so what?  It still sounds blatantly like the Peppers. It's got to be one of their funkiest, most creative, most experimental records.  Plus, they have alienated the audience that supported them with their last two, very weak releases.  This is the last good CD they put out.  I'll admit, there's a few songs to be skipped like, &quot;Warped&quot;, but overall this album had them exploring new territory and getting down with the funk more than ever. Check out &quot;Aeroplane&quot; and &quot;Coffee Shop&quot;, and then the slower songs like &quot;my Friends&quot; and the awesome (best song on the album)&quot;Tearjerker&quot;. These will stand the test of time unlike &quot;Californication&quot; which contains some of the most pointless lyrics I've ever heard.  Grow up and enjoy this album and remember for all you Dave Navarro haters, John Frusciante was a replacement too.
0440539811|1.0|I picked this book up on the recommendation of someone I thought would have good taste in books. I could have saved myself a lot of time, and $18, if I had just opened up the cover and read the 1st page reviews, particularly the following:<br />\\"More important than Ulysses or Finnegans Wake\\"<BR>                                                                            -Timothy Leary<br />This illustrious example of what's wrong with society was the ONLY person willing to attach their name to their comment. Take the following:<br />...A hundred pages in I couldn't figure out why I was wasting my time with this nonsense....after three hundred I was having too much fun to quit, and by the end I was eager to believe every word - I loved it.<BR>                          -Rolling Stone<br />To Mr. Anonymous at Rolling Stone: you are accurate only in the first part of your statement.<br />Another un-named person at Limit said, \\"...you won't be able to put it down.\\"   Did you have glue on your fingers?!?<br />My opinion should be obvious by now. Before I go any further with my opinion, let me explain in brief the book:<br />This is three volumes in one book, making up one story, pretending to be fiction based on fact. It is about a world conspiracy, starting before the dawn of civilization, by a loosely connected group called the Illuminati. They are being battled by another group(s), primary of which is the Discordian Society, a group of militant anarchists. (If you have read, or tried to read, the Principia Discordia - the modern \\"bible of Discordianism (worship of Eris the the goddess of Chaos)\\" then you have a good idea of the style of this book. It ties together the Kennedy assassinations, George Washington's supposed pot-farms, UFO's, Atlantis, the Ishmalian sect, and any other group you can come up with using a convoluted numerological system, defying intelligence.<br />There is no flow to this book. Characters, times, locations, all change from one paragraph to thenext. Sometimes even in the MIDDLE of a paragraph. Published in 1975, there are an unimaginable number of drug-related \\"scenes\\", more accurately - acid trips. The characters are all pot-smoking acid-freaks, not one of which is likable. It is filled with vulgarity, raunchiness, blasphemy, and idiocy. (I spent a LONG time in the US Navy. I have thick skin, and seen and heard \\"more disgusting things than anyone ought.\\") The appendices pretend to give the historical basis for the story, but are also riddled with fiction. The point the book tries to make is \\"Don't trust anyone ever.\\" I certainly wouldn't trust these authors.<br />To be fair I only read 400 out of the 800 pages in this book. (If I had been given this book, or checked it out of a library, I would have thrown it down a LONG time ago, but since I was robbed ... for this, I threw good time after bad money. If a book this size doesn't turn around in 400 pages, quit). Those would be the first volume (The Eye in the Pyramid), half of the second (The Golden Apple), and the appendices. I have read hundreds of books, and now quit only three. This is the WORST book I have ever picked up! For comparison: I have studied Greek Culture, Symantics, Aeronautical Engineering, Heat Transfer & Fluid Flow, Nuclear Engineering & Reactor Physics and Theory. These can be boring. (OK, they are boring.) But I finished them all (not that I had much choice.) Ever read God-Emperor of Dune? This is worse! It at least had twenty-or-so pages at the beginning and end that were ok, with the middle 400 being excruciating. How about Al Gore's Earth in the Balance? Illuminatus! is even more asinine. Will Durant's Life of Greece? Far less organized. It is a rare treat when you actually get two pages straight with the same characters in the same time.<BR>If the person who ever recommended this book said \\"This chocolate ice-cream sure is good!\\", I'd just throw the carton away without bothering to try a spoonful.<br />There is NO coherency in this book. It is not entertaining or funny (with the exception of two paragraphs dealing with a book reviewer reviewing this same book, giving roughly the same opinion. Oh, by the way, these two paragraphs are around a hundred pages apart.) It isn't thought-provoking. It only makes you SURE you don't want to drop acid.<br />In summary, I wouldn't read this book if I was serving a life sentence in prison.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Every single song is excellent, what else can be expected from this band. Too bad it's a \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD, they should have included more unreleased material so we could enjoy some music that is still lost inside Courtney's drawers.
0385495323|5.0|I don't really have anything bad to say about this book. Well, it could've been a bit longer... When I got my copy and opened the first page I just couldn't stop reading. The book serves great as an easy readable and entertaining primer to the history of codes and code breaking.<br />Kahn's Codebreakers is said to also be worth reading on the subject, but it seems to lack the newest twists of codebreaking, namely the last 30 years or so. Singh's book covers those nicely.
0060977493|5.0|What a magical, beautiful book.  Not enough can be said about her use of language .  Not to mention the ability to creep under the skin of situations and paint them in such true colors.  Her understanding of the subtle complexities of human nature is phenomenal.  Whereas some felt the novel was too dark, I did not.  I felt it depicted both the beauty and cruelty of living like nothing I had read before.  This has to be one of my favorite books of all time.  The twins and their mother are characters that will stay with me forever.  Like people I have known and loved.
0375414053|2.0|I bought and devoured this book because I too am a working professional and mom to 2 small children.  Like Kate Reddy, I work 50+ hour weeks and juggle, juggle, juggle.  <br />That \\"juggling act\\" the author nails down.  The list making, prioritizing, conflicts with the stay-at-home moms, guilt feelings, incongruity of your personal life with the \\"macho\\" atmosphere of a profressional office!  The anecdotes and feelings discussed are dead-on.<br />That is why the end is such a disappointment.  I was cheering for Kate Reddy (recognizing my own situation) and was disappointed that the book ended with heroine giving up.  Rather than recognizing the value and strength in the struggle to have professional and personal lives, the book ends with the usual sexist backlash AGAINST working woman.  It ends as yet another cautionary tale against the evils of women working and having kids - Ms. Reddy loses her husband, alienates her kids and quits her job.  In a pathetic attempt to endow her heroine with some remaining ambition, the author suggests that she will informally pursue her professional goals while staying home but this falls flat (remember how Diane Keaton's character made it big in baby food in the movie \\"Baby Boom?\\"  This is similar situation).
0393057240|5.0|Irvine Welsh's classic first novel which spawned a play and a critically acclaimed film is now available in the US in hardback, with a great non-film oriented dust jacket.  If you have read Trainspotting then you know what I'm talking about, but this book is (to put it plain and simple) one hell of a funny and interesting journey.<br />The whole gang is here; Renton, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie along with some other great voices that went unheard in the film version.  If all you know of Trainspotting is the film, then you owe it to yourself to read this book.  The perspective changes chapter to chapter and the voices are distinct and hilarious.  This is a literary tour de force with Welsh pulling out all the stops and stopping at nothing to shock, inspire, and warn.<br />I have never been able to read a novel that is the basis for a film after seeing the film.  Trainspotting is so inventive, complex, and fresh that this was not the case.  The novel and the film are both distinct and wonderful pieces of work, enjoyable for many different ways.<br />The language is a little hard to get for the first few chapters, but fighting through it is well worth it and lends to a great reading experience.  The language is original and fresh, recalling the distinct narrative of &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;.  A modern classic.
0375414053|2.0|I bought and devoured this book because I too am a working professional and mom to 2 small children.  Like Kate Reddy, I work 50+ hour weeks and juggle, juggle, juggle.  <br />That \\"juggling act\\" the author nails down.  The list making, prioritizing, conflicts with the stay-at-home moms, guilt feelings, incongruity of your personal life with the \\"macho\\" atmosphere of a profressional office!  The anecdotes and feelings discussed are dead-on.<br />That is why the end is such a disappointment.  I was cheering for Kate Reddy (recognizing my own situation) and was disappointed that the book ended with heroine giving up.  Rather than recognizing the value and strength in the struggle to have professional and personal lives, the book ends with the usual sexist backlash AGAINST working woman.  It ends as yet another cautionary tale against the evils of women working and having kids - Ms. Reddy loses her husband, alienates her kids and quits her job.  In a pathetic attempt to endow her heroine with some remaining ambition, the author suggests that she will informally pursue her professional goals while staying home but this falls flat (remember how Diane Keaton's character made it big in baby food in the movie \\"Baby Boom?\\"  This is similar situation).
B000063USY|5.0|This movie is by far the best action movie in the world in my opinion it has everything a guy could want hot chicks, hot action, &amp; even hotter cars, I believe that this is Vin's breakout movie as he does a supperb acting job &amp; makes you the viewer love the bad guy.  Anywho if I could I would give this movie 100 stars.  Ciao for now.
B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. is one of the few bands that I have listened to all my life that still appeals to me.  My first recollection of the band would be my dad blaring Document when I was four.  I have listened to these guys ever since, and have never been let down.  This album is the one that sticks out most, though.  When it came out, I was 8, and I still listen to it all the time.  I can't explain what it is about it, but I believe that perhaps it is simply perfect.  Emotion drips from every part of this, from the vocals, to the guitars, to strings.  Of every album R.E.M. released, this is the one that I'll remember when I'm 107 years old.
B00006V9A0|3.0|Why swiss cheese?  <br />Holes, my dead sir!<br />It does seem to be missing some vital tracks, and has a slightly flawed mission statement.  This compilation was an attempt at the Beatles' \\"1\\" album, according to the compilers, which considering Nirvana didn't release very many singles, and that some of their best songs werent singles (\\"Territorial Pissings\\" \\"Serve the Servants\\"), or even on their official albums (\\"Verse Chorus Verse\\" & \\"Aneurysm\\"), this whole compilation seems a wasted opportunity due to it's (slightly) flawed execution.  <br />The songs that are here, cannot be faulted.  Including at least one track from all 3 albums, the \\"Incesticide\\" compilation, some singles, and 2 tracks from the unplugged concert, which close this.  Yes, there's only one song from the Bleach album, but the idea of this compilation was to provide somthing of an introduction to Nirvana.  Not many would consider \\"Paper Cuts\\" or \\"Swap Meet\\" essential for beginners.<br />For beginners it succeeds as an introduction.<BR>But for those who aren't newborns (so to speak), it's not as definitive as it might, could, or even should have been, becoming a purchase only because of \\"You Know You're Right\\".<br />Then there's the feeling of the story being incomplete, but the album's not to fault for that, is it?
B000067DNC|4.0|StarGate has always been one of the better SciFi series on television, Season 2 continues the tradition with a wide variety of storyline, some of which continue on into even the 6th (and final?) season. Every episode show great creativity and imagination, far beyond what most series do (some of which burn out even before they complete one season). Look beyond the fact that every world looks like Canada (the series is filmed there, a TV budget wouldn't allow for world travel)and everyone always seems to speak English (too hard to come up with a new language eac week)this is one good show. I think one of my personal favorites is the episode &quot;1969&quot; with it's time travel aspects but all of them are good. Buy the set, it's well worth owning, you'll like it and wonder why in the world the studio is so slow in putting out succeeding seasons.

B000002WU9|5.0|This is one of the greatest rap CDs ever. This CD also has an appearence from Ghostface Killah on just about every song which makes this a certified classic! RZA does an awersome job on this CD as his production work is awersome as just about always.<BR> My favourite songs are, \\"Wu Gambino's\\" which features Meth, and RZA , \\"Verbal Intercourse\\" feat Nas, \\"Incarcerated Scarfaces\\" a solo for Raekwon, \\"Guillotine\\" feat Inspecta Deck and RZA, \\"Rainy Dayz\\" and alot more. However my personal favourite is \\"Ice Cream\\" it features Method Man on the chorus and featuring some awersome verses by GFK, Raekwon and Cappadonna. There is an awersome piano loop playing to it and it is a classic. Actually this whole CD is a classic so go and buy if you dont have it!
B00006V9A0|4.0|If you are a nirvana fan, you already have all these songs. (Courtney says) \\"Lets put together a greatest hits album and put one of the hundrends of unreleased songs on it so we can take all the money from the fans no matter what the rest of the band thinks (not an actual quote).\\" Instead of doing the most fan freindly thing, putting out a box set... all Courtney will settle for is money. Im not buying this record, but it is a classic because all Nirvana songs are good, ill probably just burn \\"You know your right\\" from a friend, or get it off the internet.
B00003CX95|1.0|Maybe I would be more interested in the story of a man SO HAUNTED by his wife's murder that he leads his country to war if the protagonist wasn't smirking and looking quite care-free through the entire film.  Maybe I would think him more heroic if the movie didn't show him, inside, on HORSEBACK, killing an old man who was IN HIS BED... from the perspective of the old man!!  It showed Randal Wallace, the \\"hero,\\" killing a bed-ridden geezer from the OLD MAN'S view-point, I'm serious!  Am I the only one who had trouble rooting for the elderly-man-crushing hero, telling a few lame jokes to his mates before lightheartedly rushing out to very violently kill dozens of people?  The movie can't decide whether it's lighthearted comedy or gripping drama.  If you like the movie, don't be offended, I just can't relate to it I guess, mostly because of Mel Gibson's Christ-like killer/hero; he doesn't seem all that brave to me, just really really fake.
B00006V9A0|5.0|I think it's great that the Band wa finally able to release the last song that the great kurt cobain wrote and sang with them. If anything this Cd put's all there great songs together,and let's the band's true spirt stand out. If you have not yet heard this cd you must rush out and get it right now.
B00000DMJF|5.0|This album incorporates every popular genere of music of the 1960's, influenced by the work of the 1940's and 50's, so more or less, unless you only like rap, disco, bubble gum pop, bebop, or goth punk, this album will be a very good listen. The songs are also some of the best composed songs of all time and they would be better served if they were thought of as art, rather than entertainment.
B000002BMD|5.0|Everything must go showed that the Manic Street Preachers had a future in the music industry despite the unfortunate disappearance of Richie James. All the tracks are extremely well written and performed and Richie himself had written five tracks on the album. However my favourite track is a design for life which is written by Nicky Wire. It's about time Brent999 began to read more about the plight of the working classes in other parts of the globe, rather than violently attacking the Manics because of his narrow minded world view. A World in which to him only consists of America.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is an amazing mixture of R&B, pop, rock and Latin. The first single, Dirrty is a sexy song that's really fun to dance to. The second single, Beautiful, is well, beautiful. It's one of those great songs that make you feel so good about yourself. Fighter is a great rock track featuring Dave Navarro on guitar. I'm OK is a song about her abusive father. I think that it took Christina a lot of courage to write and sing this song, and turned out perfect. Impossible is a great track written by Alicia Keys. Infatuation has a nice Latin flavor to it. You will not be disappointed by this very mature sophmore album by Christina.
B00003CXXP|1.0|You would actually think that a movie by both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick would be a classic.Well,this movie proves you wrong because both Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick worked on this movie.This movie is pathetically awful. And that little kid did a boring job too... No wonder this movie flopped in it's third week(dropping from #3 all the way down to #9).Save your money and spend it elswhere because if you are expecting this movie to be a classic because two famous directors worked on it,you are going to be proved wrong.Hope this review was of help.<br />Peace Out.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|Personaly, I thought the first MIB was better. It seems the movie is lacking in a lot of areas, that the first one didn't. Of course, most sequels to movies will not seem to fill the needs of a viewer. For me this movie didn't fulfill the expectaions I had of it.
B00003CXI1|4.0|This is one of the few &quot;childrens&quot; DVD's in my collection. I loved the book and was looking forward to the release of the movie on DVD. The movie faithfully follows the award winning book.<br />The movie looks good with only minor glitches some part of the video. Audiowise it sounded good on my system. The score by John Williams sounds especially good.<br />My one real complaint with this DVD is the special features. I bought this in order to see the deleted scenes. The amount of time I spent trying to access them outweighed the actual running time of the scene. Way too much trouble for nothing groundbreaking. I also would have liked to have a commentary track from the director and maybe some of the stars.<br />Overall this is a good DVD set, but the amount of work to access the special features is very annoying.

0380713802|2.0|Loved 'Walk in the Woods' so I bought all BB's work.  I finished this one thinking BB is kind of a jerk.  I am a long-time resident of Yer-up and his methods are cringe-inducing.  To wit: BB never seems to reserve hotel rooms, planes or trains, yet feels the locals should see his crises as theirs.  He never speaks any of the local language, yet is mystified at being misunderstood.  And toward the end, BB declares that, alas, he must work his way home to the UK because his &quot;long-suffering wife is on her semi-annual pregnancy.&quot;  Ooooh!  I'm surprised she didn't change the locks as our buddy Bill pranced around Europe on a protracted midlife-crisis tour.
B00005JJX8|5.0|There is so much to like about Alfred Hitchcock's 'To Catch a Thief' that a special DVD edition is a cause for celebration! First, the very premise of Cary Grant as a retired cat burglar enjoying life on the Rivera until a copycat criminal thrusts him back into service (and the oh-so willing arms of Grace Kelly) was so irresistable that it lured Grant, who had retired from film, back to the screen (a very fortunate decision, as he went on to make 'North by Northwest', 'Operation Petticoat', 'Charade', and other memorable films). Second, it reteamed Hitchcock with not only his favorite actor, but also with Kelly, his favorite actress, and the archetype for all the other blonde actresses in his other great films of the 50s and 60s. Third, it was a light-hearted romp, full of beautiful scenery, bawdy double-entendres (At a picnic: \\"Do you want a leg or a breast?\\" \\"You make the choice.\\"), and a plot as light as a French souffle, which was a welcome change for Hitch, after a series of much darker films.<br />Some of the supporting cast were French, which required some less than successful redubbing of dialogue, but great comic turns were provided by British character actor John Williams, and the redoubtable Jessie Royce Landis, who was so delightful as Kelly's mother that Hitchcock cast her as Cary Grant's mother in 'North by Northwest'! A bit of trivia: Brigitte Auber, who plays the busty, hormonally-charged French girl Kelly icily refers to as a 'child', was, in fact, nearly a year older than her!<br />Among the extras this very special DVD offers are a 'making-of' featurette, a Remembrance, featuring recollections of Hitchcock's daughter and granddaughter, an instructive look at how the story came to the screen, and a great piece about Hitchcock's favorite costume designer, Edith Head. You definitely get your money's worth!<br />If you want to lose yourself in a wonderful light romantic adventure, they don't come much better than this! Indulge yourself!
B00006LLLN|5.0|This live album by Alison Krauss and her band has left me in awe.  Her vocals are angelic, crystal clear, emotional....all the awesome sound you expect from her!  Her band plays their hearts out and offers excellent backing vocals and Dan Tyminski does his thing on A MAN OF CONSTANT SORROW....this cd contains all the huge hits ranging from LET ME TOUCH YOU FOR AWHILE, BABY, NOW THAT I'VE FOUND YOU, STAY, FORGET ABOUT IT, WHEN YOU SAY NOTHING AT ALL, and OH ATLANTA....this is a must have for any fan of this group and any new fans who want to experience the magic!  THE ARTISTRY OF ALISON KRAUSS AND UNION STATION is off the charts!  Way to go.....now that we have found you, NEVER GO AWAY!
B00005T30L|1.0|I actualy thought this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. It's just incredibly awful. Thora Birch has an incredibly large rear in this film too...
B00005YUNY|5.0|The sound quality is fantastic, the music is the greatest on this or any other planet and the orchestra is filled with great-looking women. What more needs to be said?<BR>If you're the type who liked the video effects of Yessongs and 9012Live, you can turn them on with this DVD; if you're not, you can leave them off. It's the best of both worlds.<BR>The new song &quot;In the Presence Of&quot; is an instant Yes classic. The older songs sound great with the addition of an orchestra.<BR>In all, the skill and enthusiasm of Yes is matched only by that of the orchestra players, and this is a must-have for lovers of great progressive rock.
B00006L83N|5.0|I'm not going to critique each song/riff, but let me just say as a fan of the band, this CD is just fantastic.  It seems with each studio effort, Symphony X just gets better &amp; better.  This CD has a harder edge than V.  All band members are featured and give their best effort.  I recommend it.  Some of their best work to date.
B00005R23Z|3.0|Great movie, but if I had to do it over again I'd skip the superbit edition.<BR>My eyes aren't sophisticated enough to see much difference in quality between regular DVD and superbit. Yet the superbit takes up so much space on the disk there's no room left for those 'extras' we all love, like commentaries etc. It's just the film.<BR>This, by the way, is what I call a &quot;real&quot; science fiction film; that is, it has a plausible plotline based on real science, rather than &quot;space opera&quot; like Star Wars or pop schlock like &quot;ET&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters.&quot;
B00004W50Z|4.0|I couldn't give this album 5 stars because that would put it in the class of Big Pink and The Band...but in terms of its musical quality, it is still better than most. This album has often been put down by critics, but I think that's just because The Band had so much to live up to. This can by no means be called a slump...but just a move in a different direction.  Stage Fright touches on some deep themes, such as betrayal (The Rumor), fear (Stage Fright), parenthood (All la glory)...but still leaves room for some fun (Time to Kill, Just Another Whistle Stop). it's another great Band album that doesn't dissappoint.
0792846338|5.0|A hugely entertaining film. Kathy Bates and James Caan gave phenomenal performances, both were <BR>consistently into their character through out the movie. Some people can relate to Annie's <BR>(Bates) obsession and fanaticism, well at least to some level since Annie's case is <BR>in the extreme. I personally can relate how a certain book or movie or music can affect a certain <BR>person's life that you tend to do sometimes ridiculous stuffs. Well picture all of that In Annie's <BR>character but turn it to its extreme. <br />Although the relationship of Bates and Caan weren't developed to the fullest, the strength <BR>of the film is when they are together. Who could forget the scene where Bates hit Caan's feet<BR>with a axe or something, <BR>the actual scene wasn't shown but you still cant help but close your eyes knowing what <BR>Bates was doing. Plus of course the climactic finale of the movie. <br />I hugely recommend this film, fun to watch with your friends when you've got nothing to do. <BR>But you could also watch it alone, that way no noisy laughs from your friends. LOL :)
B00004W510|5.0|When my friends ask me why I bring up The Band so often, this is usually the album I'll put on. While Big Pink is at least as enjoyable and masterful, the 'brown album' is, in my opinion, the best introduction to The Band's sound. From the opening plea of &quot;Across the Great Divide&quot; to the final, electrifying solo of &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot;, this might be the perfect album. It has beautiful ballads (&quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, &quot;Whispering Pines&quot;, &quot;The Unfaithful Servant&quot;), hard rockers (&quot;Jemima Surrender&quot;, &quot;King Harvest&quot;, &quot;Look out Cleveland&quot;, &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;) and everything in between...my favorite song on the album changes from week to week...I mean, how do you choose among the spine-tingling solo in Unfaithful Servant, Levon's Southern drawl in Cripple Creek, and the down-home feeling of &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot;? You don't, you just listen to the whole album and be happy that you've discovered such a great band.
B0000524CY|5.0|This movie is terrifying, I heard people when this release ran out of the theathers screaming and puking everywhere! Not overrated at all! Every scene seems spooky and eerie, especially the priest's dreams of her mother. The screams, the cussing, the profanity makes it even more terrifying, The Masterbatation screen without a doubt scare me, me and dad were chill at that! This movie is a classic, and if nobody excepts it, they don't what good horror filmmaking is!
B00004W50T|5.0|It's really tough to decide which album is best, this one or the self-titled follow-up. One of my favorite things to do is just sit back and listen to this album from start to finish, it calms me more than any anything could, and leaves me with a smile on my face every time. I can't help but think of Robbie, Richard, Levon, Garth, and Rick just making good music in the basement of big pink, jamming away and taking breaks to talk to the neighbors.  I wasn't around at the time the album came out, so I can't vouch for its effect on rock, but I can definitely say that this album is nearly flawless. It has a feel unlike nearly any other album (even any other Band album), and makes me want to sing along and appreciate at the same time. It makes me nostalgic for times I never experienced. Highlights: In a Station (Richard's falsetto), Caledonia Mission, The Weight, We Can Talk, Chest Fever, etc, etc...the whole album is a masterpiece. The Band are the most underrated unit in history.
1577311523|5.0|About thirty years ago I was walking through an art gallery and I read a sign that said \\"All we ever have is now\\". It struck me so profoundly that I have posted it in every one of my art studios since, as a reminder to stay in the present. However, I didn't know how to help myself to be in the now for more that just fleeting seconds. This book told me how.
B000060P79|5.0|If you like Blink 182, Sum 41 or Green Day, you really can't miss with this band.  A solid first album with great hooks and nice harmony.  Don't expect anything real deep, but fans of pop-punk should really enjoy this.  Keep an eye out for another new band called Good Charlotte
B00005K3OT|4.0|A rose is a rose is a rose is a...<br />That by any other name would smell as sweet.<br />So, what is in a name?  A lot I would posit when it comes to this movie.  Take for instance, this movie came out a few years after the hugely successful Alfonso Arau-directed, \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\"  Hollywood seemed to be in the habit of producing doubles at the time.  \\"A Bug's Life\\" was successful so someone produced \\"Antz\\", etcetera, etcetera.  The \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" \\"Chocolat\\" seemed like another such mirror image conundrum, thus my movie-viewing family stayed away from this one.  That is until recently, and I must say, this is a different film and one on top of it that is wholly enjoyable.<br />It tries a bit too hard to be foreign and although shot in an authentic French provincial village (apparently they actually have these dotted across the countryside of France) comes off as having an American tilt to it.  So, here is the other difficulty in the name.  If you talk about watching this movie to your friends or ask a video rental clerk for it, it's almost impossible to pronounce the name without coming across as an \\"I only watch films instead of movies and if the film is foreign it instantly is raised in my esteem\\" snobbery.  Try it.  Pronounce \\"Chocolat\\" to your dog sitting next to you now by your computer.  See, your nose instantly goes in the air, the corners of your mouth are down-turned in a pouty snootery, and the top of your head wiggles every so slightly side to side to indicate...there...I've just said something foreign making me somewhat better than you.  \\"Chocolat.\\"  Take this piece of advice, since the film is slightly Americanized (how can you have Johnny Depp in it and not be?) go ahead and Americanize the title by calling it Chocolate.  If it was good enough for Hershey, by God, it can be good enough for you.  Besides, your dog and friends will respect you more for it.<br />Back to the movie.  Juliette Binoche is somewhat miscast as a wanderer-drifter magical Chocolatier.  She is just too prim and proper coming off as a French Martha Stewart to be a true wizardress succumbing to the call of the North Wind at a whim and off like a pastry puff to the next town to weave her magic.  Judy Dench is...well Judy Dench, which is to say the lady is brilliant.  I could watch her act all day.  Johnny Depp is fun as a riverboat drifter rat and the interplay between the stodgy townsfolk's small-town politics and the magic these outsiders bring to the French village is one of the most compelling parts of the movies.  Overall, despite the name, I would say it's an enjoyable view.rifter magical Chocolatier.

It was the last war fought without a political agenda or national policy being the driving force.  It was fought for the purpose of preserving our own nation's way of life, the right of other nations to enjoy the same freedom, and the outright survival of people and nations.  The men who were tasked with the awesome responsibility of winning this war were your ordinary, everyday men.  From Harvard graduates to midwestern farmboys, they all heeded the call to arms.  Often referred to as 'citizen soldiers' (a title of another Ambrose book), these men were not career military.  They were civilians when they entered the war and would return to those lives upon the wars conclusion.  Yet, it was these brave men who fought against the seemingly superior forces of the German and Japanese Empires and emerged triumphant in the most critical victory over tyranny and evil this world has ever experienced.  <BR><BR>   \\"Band of Brothers\\" tells the tale of one such group of brave men whose exploits were nothing short of spectacular as the armies of the Allied nations sought to bring down the German empire.  The men of Easy Company of the 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne embodied the greatness of the American spirit and clearly demonstrated why, once they entered the fray at Normandy, the tide had turned against Hitler's Army.  Easy Company was one of the true elite squadrons in World War II.  It was tasked with such crucial operations as airborne landings behind German lines to enable the D-Day landings to be a success to holding the fort during the last major German offensive at Bastogne and Battle of the Bulge.  <BR><BR>   The casualty rate for this group of men was high (150% from the point of its inception until its decommissioning after the war), but that was due to the nature of the missions.  The training these soldiers received in preparation for battle is what enabled to avoid higher casualty rates and to succeed in most of the missions they engaged in.  The men of Easy Company make no secret of their disdain for their initial commanding officer, Captain Sobel.  They considered him to be a petty, selfish, mean-spirited martinet.  They would just as soon go into battle with him leading them as go into battle without a gun.  Yet, to a man, Easy Company also says that it is because of Sobel that they were such an elite group.  If only to spite him or to avoid petty wrath, these men trained faster, harder, and better than most units serving.  It is clear from narrative that, despite Sobel's 'contribution', the true glue of unit was Lieutenant (later Major) Richard Winters and his staff non-commissioned officers.  Winters and the non-coms were so universally admired and respected by the other soldiers that they were able to be asked more of themselves and produce it.  <BR><BR>    Each soldier in \\"Easy Company\\" has his own story.  Ambrose does a fine job telling as many of the stories as possible without bogging down the narrative with too many names and unrelated tales.  There is a certain awe at the ordeals these men faced.  It's hard not to have butterflies in one's stomach as one reads about the men preparing for their first drop over Normandy under heavy fire and in dark conditions.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" chronicles these men from that initial Normandy invasion all the way until the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest and shows why this country does and always will owe a debt of gratitude to the men who 'laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom (Lincoln)'.
0671578855|5.0|Bujold continues to deliver in this fun filled story!  It is great the way the characters have deleloped since the first Miles books while still maintaining a sense of humor.  Would recomend the series to anyone!
0312265859|2.0|I have eagerly awaited each new book in the series but this one has almost put me off buying any more.  It feels as though it was written by someone else copying the style of the last ones. What worked in the previous books - lets throw in some of that.  The car thing is getting old .  The ranger scene - less said the better after such a great build up.<br />I bought the previous books as soon as they were released in hardback.  The next one can wait till paperback and even then i'll read a bit in the bookshop first before purchasing.<br />What a letdown.
1878424319|4.0|I picked up this book in Staples, of all places and immediately read it right through. I have just read it a second time (4 months later) and find it just as wonderfull. Clearly explained, Ruiz explains four simple principles that, when applied in your life, can help eliminate much of the missery we see in our world. The only thing I didn't like about the book was the constant reference to those things that hinder us as &quot;black magic&quot;. It seems he could find a better term. Although it only shows up in a few places, the books seems to assume that it's readers are Christian and American. Other than these two points, which don't detract from the value of the ideas in it, I found it a great book.
0786880708|5.0|This book is  gem--it delivers on its promise, to convey the depth of daily meditation with some prointers on &quot;how-to&quot;, and the impact it can have on your life. Clearly written, it never panders or digresses, and is as pleasant and informative a read as I've seen on such a weighty subject....a must! Dr. S
B0000214F3|3.0|Yes, it was boring.  Even watching the ever-watchable Brad Pitt got boring.  He and Anthony Hopkins are great actors, and Hopkins was great in this, but the movie just dragged.  You can read the plot in the other summaries.  Great plot idea, and well thought out.  But the character of Death was DULL.  I thought Death would be more interesting than that.  Hopkins was great as a man facing his own mortality however.  Marcia Gay Harden as his dutiful daughter was very interesting to watch; however Claire Forlani as the \\"doctor\\" daughter was dull too.  She's beautiful to look at, but boring to watch act.  First of all, I didn't believe for a minute that she was a medical resident.  She had way too much free time to spend with her family to actually be a doctor in training!  And she had little backbone or fortitude that I associate with female doctors.  Too timid by far.  Jefrrey Tambor (sp?) was amusing as the SIL who wants to please everyone.  Not a suck-up as someone else wrote, but someone who wants to be friendly and keep things positive.  The character of Drew (sorry, don't know actor's name) was a creepy villian whose treachery was obvious from the beginning.  The ending seemed anti-climactic to me.  If they'd walked off into the darkness and left it there, fine, but to have the first Pitt character come back seemed unbelievable. I mean, how did he get his body back?  Anyway, unconvincing performances by many and unsatisfying plot lines.  I'd check it out at the library before I'd spend money to buy this one.
0783235968|5.0|I won't do a synopsis, that's already been done.  I just wanted to say that I love this movie, it is full of magic and hope.  I am envious of the ability to just take off and drive across country to pursue an impulse.  I love seeing the ghosts from another era come out and interact with the family.  When Burt Lancaster's character comes off the field and gives up his dream for a second time, it speaks to the goodness of mankind.  Except for some language, I would have no problem showing this to my kids.  I now have in-laws in Iowa and Minnesota and I sure wish I could go visit the baseball diamond and am tempted to look up Chisholm when we go to visit.  I'm asking for the DVD for Christmas!
B00006AW2M|3.0|TSMR, although panned heavily by critics, is not a bad album. TSMR was released during the psychedelic onslaught of albums  soon after the Beatles Srgt Pepper was released.  The Stones were simply caught up in times. I disagree that the album completely rips off Srgt Pepper.  The album is uniquely a Stones one. I would rate it 31/2 stars if I could.Highlights are &quot;She's a Rainbow&quot; and &quot;2000 Light Years from Home&quot;. The former has wonderful string arrangements by John Paul Jones (pre Led Zeppelin). The latter has a trippy feel due to the use of the Mellotron, a precursor to the synthesizer. Songs to skip are &quot;Gomper&quot;, and Sing this Song (See What Happens). Both are boring overlong psychedelic hodgepodge. There is some great guitar work in &quot;Citadel&quot;. The Stones, however,wisely went back to their rock'n'roll roots with their follow-up album, &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot;.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Being and avid collector of the Spiderman comics, I was disappointed with the liberties taken to transfer the story to film... but as a fan of the comic I felt they tried to squeeze too much into 2 hours. The deviations I did not like included his origin, his discovery of his transformation and the romance with Mary Jane Watson...They should have at least left in the webshooters that he invented. Now for what I did like about the movie. His transformation happening over night makes more sense than the comic. His learning curve on swinging from his webs were funny and more 'realistic'. The special effects and action scenes were awesome to say the least. The Green Goblin costume was a passable interpretation of the comic, but a bit hokey. Randy Savage as the wrestler was a humorous casting and a welcome interpretation...Over all I liked the movie...it is a fine movie, but you'll find yourself longing for more
B00000J7S8|5.0|What a lovely disc this is! The combination of Krall's gorgeous, slightly smoky timbre, coupled with classic songs in relaxed, understated arrangements is totally winning. And her colleagues are some of the best musicians around.<br />There isn't a weak cut on the entire program. It's hard not to like \\"Let's Fall in Love,\\" delivered with an almost casually light touch, and the playfully sexy \\"Popsicle Toes.\\" But listen to how Krall's voice caresses the vocal line of \\"Do It Again\\" or \\"When I Look in Your Eyes,\\" and totally transforms \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance,\\" using a soft Latin groove. Everyone will have a favorite.<br />Here is a great jazz performer for our time, blessed with a supple, slinky voice and formidable piano skills. (I know many who think she could succeed with either her singing OR her piano-playing, but she generously gives us both.)  Like many consummate musicians, her work appears effortless, and enjoying it is equally so.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Just a wonderful, mesmerizing film from the brilliant mind of David Lynch, with little reference toi his prior work save its intensity and carity of vision. Don't get hung up on trying to make sense of this, just enjoy it for what it is, which is purely a delight for the mind and senses.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash keeps getting better.  I rushed right out and bought this on the day of release.  It is beyond great.  He took some of my very favorite songs (&quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Hurt&quot;) and made new versions that are my favorite songs all over again.  I've been hearing &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; on public radio for a few weeks now, and I couldn't believe how great it was when I heard it.  The duet with Fiona Apple on &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is chilling.  The new original &quot;The Man comes Around&quot; is his best original ever.
B00006J3T4|5.0|It is just the best solo album from a man who knows how he wants his album to listen. It is a must for all MK and DS fans and not only. Why aye man is a classic in my opinion,so does you don't know you're born. Beautiful lyrics from one of the greatest story tellers of our days. Recommended!
B00006L7XQ|4.0|This is a good album, and I do not regret my purchase for a second, but I am a huge JC fan and I would buy &quot;The Man in Black Reads the Phone Book&quot; if it was released on CD.  That said, the magic of the American Recordings (this is the fourth with Rick Rubin) is almost worn out.  Clearly, the other three releases are superior, and if I were starting over, I would buy the first, then III, then II (very close between II and III), then take a big drop to this one.  I consider I-III essential, this release less so.  Don't get me wrong, it's enjoyable, and the title track is outstanding.  It's just that Johnny sounds a little older, and a little more tired, and the covered songs are a little bit more of a stretch.  Also &quot;The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot; is a huge misstep--for Springsteen fans, think &quot;57 Channels&quot; or &quot;Part Man, Part Monkey&quot; bad--so bad it's embarrassing.  It's like listening to a huge automobile accident.  You can't tear yourself away, yet it hurts to listen.  Anyway, buy it if you have to (like me), but buy the other discs in the series first.
B00005RDAF|5.0|I am a huge Britney fan and of course i buy everything that comes out from her but this DVD is mainly for a Britney Collector. I mean people who only like her a little bit wouldnt really want the HBO Commercial (or pepsi one) but a true Britney collector would so it all depends on how much you like Britney. Heres my adviceBRITNEY HUGE FAN: Up to you weather you buy it or not BRITNEY COLLECTOR: A Must Buy.<br />This DVD may be a let down but BRITNEY I LOVE YA!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Xtina's new album, Stripped, is a wonderful exploration of sound and style. She effortlessly saranades us through many different styles of music. \\"Beautiful\\" is a song that is just like it's name. It is essential for all women to listen to it. \\"I'm ok\\" is a stunnenly emotional tribute to her childhood past. This cd honestly is one you can just sit and listen to without having to change tracks because each and every one is wonderful. I highly recommend for everyone to buy it. Anyone would like it...It defys genres!
B00004Y87I|5.0|Wow! What a movie! If you like Danny Kaye, then without a doubt you'll enjoy this classic Kaye film.  In addition to Danny's normal good humor and hilarious puns, you'll enjoy suspense as Walter Mitty (played by Danny Kaye) has experiences (or are they just daydreams????) that bring the movie to life. Danny Kaye uses his great talent as an actor as he plays various parts in his short, but comical daydreams.  His \\"real\\" life is just as funny as he constantly does unusual and absent-minded little things that make his friends and family wonder...You'll love it.
0783225903|4.0|If you can get up the courage to watch it, BRAZIL is a thoroughly mind-blowing film. I say 'if' because I avoided the film for the longest time, having heard about how 'wierd' it was. Wierd it is indeed, but that's not a bad thing. There is 'crap wierd' (THE FISHER KING) and 'intriguing wierd' of which this film is the latter. It's incredible when everything comes together in the end. The sets and scenes are amazing. Often, before you've had a chance to determine exactly what you're looking at, the scene changes. You have to be on your toes when you watch this (not like an annoying MTV video mind you). The comedy is definitely BLACK, but very entertaining. This film fits nicely alongside the more serious tones of 1984.  It is paranoid and bizarre like 1984, but has some comedy elements that lighten the load a bit. <br />The DVD picture and sound quality are good I guess. The extras are nice, but I have not watched them in a while. There is no point in giving plot points here, you just have to see the film. It's like nothing you've ever seen. Oh, you get Robert De Niro too, so what are you waiting for? <br />Recommended.
0553277472|4.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (which may be the best title of all time) is a bizarre and insightful journey into ... well, psychology, motorcycle maintenance, and pretty much everything in between. This unique book is impossible to classify. Its long-winded tangents into Zen philosophy range from inane navel contemplation to mystical mountaintop profundity.<br />The book begins with a first-person narrative of an unnamed man taking a motorcycle trip from Minnesota to the Northwest with his young son, Chris, and another married couple. The author's description of biking absolutely nails its allure, frustrations, and rewards. His book is required reading for all serious bikers (those who can read, that is). As the journey progresses, the narrator expounds upon the art of motorcycle maintenance and why some shy away from it, dividing riders into two groups: romantic and classic thinkers. Then he spends 100 pages splitting the romantic/classic atom. Surprisingly, the result is not some pot-smoker's rambling, but a sophisticated and well-informed essay on the human condition.<br />The book continues with alternating passages of narrator lucidity--as he describes their mundane travels through America's backwaters--and more deep dives into topics most of us have never invested two seconds pondering: the definition of technology, quality, duality, and Aristotelian reasoning. But Pirsig slowly introduces a third component to the story: a shadowy character named Phaedrus. A mystery develops for the reader. Is Phaedrus a real person? Or a figment of the narrator's imagination? His alter ego? Is the deep-thinking narrator schizophrenic? Or descending into madness?<br />Zen and the Art is at times maddening with its hour-long dissections of trivial matters, but will also have you seeing many things in a whole new light. Apparently, almost nothing in life is as it seems. In the end, it's a &quot;quality&quot; book (you'll have to read the book to understand this). I might have enjoyed it more as a younger, more idealistic person, but it's well worth the time investment at any age. --Christopher Bonn Jonnes, author of Wake Up Dead.
B00004YW6I|4.0|what is probably most noteworthy about 'stories is a song called \\"this mess we're in\\". it's a duet with thom yorke, of radiohead. this guy is one of the most overrated britpop songwriters there is, and given the sensationalist nature of the british press that's saying something. despited this, there are some great lyrics floating to the surface here, and the song has a pulsing, aching quality to it. absolutely timeless, the best song on a fine album.<BR>\\"kamikaze\\" and \\"this is love\\" are the album's only real rockers. The album starts of with a couple of tracks that should kick, but the slight, clicking drums kill the music. on these opening cuts, harvey comes across as a female iggy pop, if iggy didn't really believe in the rock genre and just used it as a canvas for his ambitious lyrical ideas. whether these ideas work or not is very subjective. i would say that they don't.<BR>\\"this is love\\" is especially strong, with some of the most memorable and gutsy lyrics about sex i've ever heard. it's pretty impressive that even when harvey uses her rhythm section she comes across as totally honest and uncontrived.<BR>in between \\"good fortune\\" and \\"kamikaze\\" the music gets mellower, more introspective and more new york obsessed of course. the lyrics tend to work even when the themes of the songs often run toghether, so that some of the tracks tend to reflect each other. it's a u turn for the better after the disapointing opening.<BR>the album closes on a very different note, with barebones piano over an electronic backbeat and some personal stuff from harvey.<BR>'stories doesn't always work, but when it does it's first class, and harvey gives her all throughout.
B000005S37|1.0|I just heard Lou is putting out a new double cd called \\"Something on my mind\\" You see it's about a guy who sitting on a toilet all day recording himself passing gas in 4 parts. Come on people, to give this bilge a serious review means you have way to much time on your hands. I would just like to condem the what ever they call themselves record company, and Lou Reed for re-issuing this pile. And warn anybody and everyone out there to save your money!
B00005M989|1.0|...in all honesty, you'd be waaaaayyyyy better off in just randomly picking a Prince studio album instead of buying this .... The album is a very scattershot and brief collection of 17 of Prince's hits, and while this may get a casual fan excited, keep mind that there are already two separate \\"Hits\\" discs that have much more to offer than this on their own ...so I wouldn't recommend this unless you are truly a casual fan and nothing more.
B0000028UK|4.0|Pearl Jam sure set the bar high for their sophomore effort. Fortunately for all of us music-lovers out here, they basically met their goals. VS turned out to be quite a good album. Some call it their best, but not me. I will say that it is very good and, in my opinion, their last truly great recording. If forced to choose between TEN and VS, I would choose TEN. But I'd choose VS before any of their other material. I can feel the flames of avid Pearl Jam fans licking my feet right now...<br />VS contains the raw power of songs \\"Go\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Blood\\" and \\"Rearviewmirror\\" and the restrained emotion of \\"Elderly...\\", \\"Leash\\", \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Indifference\\". Great tunes. I never really cared for \\"Glorified G\\" but oh well. I like the way the energy of the band was channelled on VS (the band is definitely more ANGRY), but overall I like the song writing on TEN a *bit* better. Comparisons aside, VS is a powerful statement by Pearl Jam that they were not going to go away anytime soon. The title even betrays the confrontational nature of the band-especially Eddie Vedder (anyone remember him taking on Ticketmaster?)
B00006JDVV|4.0|I am a huge fan of this movie, let's not mistake that. But, my friends also ridicule me for loving bad tv movies like the recently made live action Jack and the Beanstalk. With that being said, I will say a little more about this movie. Be prepared to be disappointed. If you love stories about dragons, you will probably like this movie, although the focus is more on the people of a future society plagued by attacks from the creatures. There are many interesting concepts in this movie, which I would have liked to see the screenwriter delve into a little more deeply, because as it is, the plot is left quite shallow. There was potential there! And the worst part of the whole movie is a scene where the main character should have died, and doesn't. I could not comprehend why he lived though the scene. Unfortunately, the dialougue is a little lame too. The kind that makes you groan because it is too corny at certain points in the film. The special effects are awesome, but you don't get to see much of the dragons throughout the film. What you do see is worth it, but like I said, be prepared. You are not going to see a movie with dragons flying around constantly. For me the good thing about this movie is where it was trying to go, and the awesome glimpses of dragons that you do get. My favorite scene? A huge dragon perches on top of the \\"castle\\" in the movie, wraps its wings around it, and breaths fire onto it, so its wings glow. Amazing! For the men who want their girlfriends or wives to watch this, entice them with promises of a shirtless Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey!!! If you are willing to trade out the bad, and love the great parts of this movie, and if you like fantasy/sci-fi/action flicks, then you will not regret seeing this movie!
B00006LLLN|5.0|When the musicians are this great you really can get a great live CD and Alison &amp; the boys really are this great.  My only frustration with this band is that I can't take in a live show every week but now I have the next best thing.  They keep the banter to a minimun (but what's included is typically charming) and let the music speak for itself.<br />Alison has the voice of an angel and anyone who's seen them perform knows that she doesn't need a recording studio to help her out.  This record captures that.  Union Station is at the top of its game.  Song selection, show pacing, it's all here.  <br />I'll be putting this one on the stereo, closing my eyes and pretending I'm at my local theater nightly, applauding like a maniac.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I have to admit I hate movies where most of the effects and even acting are done by CGI (pay attention George Lucas). But this film is an exception to that rule.<br />The acting is fantastic. Maguire and Defoe are excellent choices as Spiderman and the Green Goblin. And the story was extremelly close to the original comic origin of both characters. Something you'll find less and less of these days in comic-originated movies (see X-men for more info on that).<br />There are really only two flaws in this film. One is the suit of the Green Goblin. He has been made into more of a mechanical character than the original. But the most significant flaw is the webbing on Spiderman himself. Although the film did a nice job of utilizing his web-shooting power and subsequent discovery of it, it wasn't orignially intended to be a natural ability. Originally his webbing was synthetically created by \\"web-shooters\\" which he created and applied to his wrists.<br />But the overall rating for this film is much better than any other comic-to-film movie to date and is most certainly worth watching.
0743233832|5.0|The Hicks brothers have produced a handsome volume of the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius that is also the best translation available. The old Penguin edition translation was servicable. George Long's translation was incomprehensible in many parts. The Gregory Hays translation does very well but is not as transparently clear and as elegant as this one. I got this book the first week that it came out and it will be my preferred edition for many years to come. Highly recommended.
B000000YBQ|5.0|I can't decide if this disc or its companion SUNDAY AT THE VILLAGE VANGUARD is better.  Both were recorded at the same time in the same place, New York's famous Village Vanguard jazz club.  Much like SATVV, WALTZ FOR DEBBY is a masterpiece of jazz trio recordings.  The quietness of Bill's soft passages let us hear small talk in the background and the clinking of silver and glass.  Gorgeous, of course.  The mental image that most people have of the 'jazz joint' is exemplified and personified here in beautiful digital clarity.  The title track is probably the most famous on this set, but for my money NOTHING comes close to the beauty of &quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; and &quot;Porgy (I Loves You Porgy)&quot; which are, how should I say it?...probably the two most beautiful jazz recordings I have heard.  Ever.  In between you get the stunning &quot;My Romance&quot; and the extended &quot;Detour Ahead&quot;, both of which are also shining jewels in Jazz music's illustrious crown.  I cannot recommend an album more than I am recommending this one.<br />Essential.
B000021Y77|5.0|I should mention I love foreign movies and I don't mind subtitles. I thank my lucky stars for voiceovers on this visual masterpiece! I wish everyone would have to see this movie. Lola has to get money- and fast. And she happens to get more than one chance. Interesting to say the least. Beautiful to watch to say more. You will never watch another movie that time flies by so fast... which will make you not regret watching this even if you don't like it. BUT- I guarantee that anyone and their mother will love this film. And watch it more than once, because it's the little things. It is placement of scenery and the quick flash-forward slide shows. Intrigued? Buy it!!! I will say no more than that this movie deserves more than the five stars I was able to give it!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Just a few adjectives are enough: Raw; Haunting; Sweet; Exquisite; Austere. A work of beauty that makes me see Johnny Cash as a different - and beautiful - Man (capital M). P.S. The production on the album doesn't hurt, either! Kudos to Mr. Rubin.
B00005J4HH|4.0|Muse's first album, Showbiz, was a tantalizing but uneven effort. This album is a succesful followup. The formula is the same -- driving technified guitar backed by synthesizers, overload melodies, Thome-Yorke-esque vocals -- but is better executed here. Muse have progressed as songwriters, and Symmetry is full of powerful pieces -- especially Bliss and Plug In Baby, each of which are worth the price of the album by themselves. Symmetry can get a bit repetitive at times, but is overall a worthwhile buy, and shows potential for further progress in the future.
B00005OM4Q|4.0|If you like movies about great 70's rock bands you'll love this. Almost famous is about a seventeen year old boy, who get's a job with rollin stone magazine. They send him to do a story on a band called &quot;Still Water&quot;. Once he's there, he realizes that being a rock star is not what it's cracked up to be. This is a must see if you like movies that are filled with good music and a good story line.
0790733226|4.0|Having owned and seen many DVD's since getting my player in '98, I can now come back and say that this is one of the best. CONTACT is based on a book by Carl Sagan, and I approached it with caution but interest. It was a wonderful film to see on the big screen and of course lost some of that power in the transfer to your TV set. That aside, the transfer is GREAT and the sound-especially if you have DD 5.1 (I believe there is a DTS version as well) -is fantastic. The extras are actually interesting here; I really loved the explanation of the computer animated sequence for the opening of the picture. The other menu items are also interesting.<br />Knowing Sagan's proclivities, I figured there would be a strong 'bash on religious thought' undercurrent to the film. I was pleased to see that that was not the case. The monumental issues of faith and science were *generally* dealt with respectfully. I did find Matthew M's character (former man of the cloth Palmer Joss) to be an interesting foil for Jodie Foster, SETI scientist, answering her pointed questions with even more thought-provoking statements like \\"Prove it.\\" I appreciated that because, in fact, the naturalist/rationalist is at the same pains to support their ideologies. But I digress... Perhaps the most interesting point to the entire film is the way in which Foster's doubting character is forced to defend herself in the face of evidence that she imagined the entire experience. This alone leads me to believe that the entire purpose of the film is to tell the story of one person's transformation from skeptic to surprised and berated believer. How interesting...<br />On the other hand, the preacher has no problem sleeping with Jodie Foster which was more than a bit strange, and the film's consistant portrayal of religious followers/leaders as morons and lunatics (Busey) grated on me after a while. Ugh. How tiring. How a number of reviewers can claim that this film was some sort of religious propaganda is *beyond*me.  Outside of 'Palmer Joss' the 'religious' characters are anything but likeable.  In the end, the film was still very good and well worth seeing despite these issues. It remains a powerful film with amazing originality.  The effects are wonderful, the displays of CNN crew and President Clinton effective at first, then a bit annoying.  Finally, to answer the question 'What was the point of having Jodie Foster travel all that way to meet her father?'  Uh, I think the reasons for that are obvious:<br />1)  To prove to some of the numbskull film audience out there that perhaps not everything in life is not tied up with a ribbon as nicely as we want it to be.<br />2)  The fact that perhaps this alien culture tailors these trips to the individual making them-and they knew that Foster's character had unfinished business with her father.<br />3)  Plus, rather than overloading Foster's character, they presented themselves in a pleasing form.  Makes sense to me.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This is a pretty good CD, but I still think there are some songs that are in there that shouldn't be. About a Girl, Been a Son, Penneroyal tea and the David Bowie COVER The Man who Sold the world are all great songs, but I don't think they are greatest hits worthy. There not even that popular. Also what happened to Polly? That is an awsome Nirvana song (and quite popular) that is suprisingly not on there greatest hits, also School and Anuerism are missing. Yet, overall the CD is still mighty good and worth having seeing it still contains All Apollogies, In Bloom, Lithium, Heart Shaped Box, Sliver, Smells like teen spirit, Come as you are and Rape me. Plus it has the newly released Track \\"You Know Your Right\\" which is pretty cool.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Please check out Natatlie Merchant's cd Ophelia. It's a true classic. From start to finish, it doesn't disappoint. Give it one listen, and you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.
B00006F2TV|5.0|I've gotta admit, I didn't expect [spiderman] to be such a hit, I also didn't expect it to be such a phenemonemon.  My expectations were wrong.  Spiderman is probably one f the best movies I have seen in agood while.  It is a great mix of action, romance, action, and drama.  Tobey MAguire was just born to be spiderman.  he is a great actor.  Also this DVD is a great example of a DVD player.  It is loaded to the brim with special features, and DVD rom features.  The special affects are just plain and simpley absoulutely beautiful!  It is some of the greatest affects of all time(although not pioneering)  All in all I would reccomend any comic book fan, or anybody else to come and see this wondeful movie.  I can't wait for the sequel.<br />  ~Daniel~
B000002AH9|5.0|I always wondered what *fragile* sounded like.  Now I know.  It sounds like Billie Holiday singing on one of her final albums, her voice as tired and damaged as can be, with a lush orchestra backing her just to make the juxtaposition all the more stunning.  As a singer myself, just listening to her voice gives me chills.  I no longer have to imagine what years of substance abuse does to the lungs and vocal cords.  It is painfully obvious.  This is not to say that the listening experience is painful; in fact, many feel this is essential Billie.  The factory-placed sticker states that this was Billie's personal favorite recording.  Whether or not that is true, LADY IN SATIN is a gorgeous record, but probably not one you will spin a lot.  Holiday had deteriorated so visibly and audibly by this point that I'm amazed she got thru the recording sessions.  The strain in her voice only serves to drive home the lyrics which are mostly about lost love, forlorn love, sadness etc.  The performances are all the more effective for this-thank God her doctor didn't make her stay home!  We music lovers are so much the better for her work on this tortured, melancholy recording.<br />Highly recommended.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I LOVE JOHNNY CASH! I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM, SO HE COULD NEVER GET LESS THAN 5 STARS FROM ME. HE IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING, AND SO IS THIS CD! THE MAIN PROBLEM THAT I HAVE WITH THIS CD IS THAT IT IS ALL TOO FAMALIAR. JOHNNY DOES DO JUSTICE TO EACH COVER TRACK AND DOES ACTUALLY COME OFF MAKING THEM HIS OWN, BUT JUST THAT, NOTHING IS NEW, YOU SING ALONG BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO KNOW THE SONG, THAT IS BECAUSE YOU ALREADY KNOW IT! THE MAN IS IN THE SONGWRITERS HALL OF FAME, AND HIS SONGWRITING SKILLS DO SINE ON HIS OWN PENNED SONGS, BUT AT LEAST IN PART THEY ARE REMAKES OF HIS EARLIER WORKS. I WOULD MUCH RATHER HEAR ORIGINAL [gutsy] NEW CASH PENNED TRACKS ABOUT DEATH, PAIN & GOD ET. THAN COVERS OF OTHERS! AGAIN, THIS IS BETTER THAN JUST ABOUT ANYTHING ELSE OUT THERE, SO BUY IT AND LOVE IT, JUST NEXT TIME AROUND GOD WILLING JOHNNY CASH SHOULD DO JOHNNY CASH, THAT IS WHAT HE DOES BEST!

0385508417|5.0|This book is a walk on the light side for John Grisham. It's very different for him. I enjoyed it. His presentation reminds me a lot of the already well known &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; and the becoming well known &quot;West Point:..&quot; by Norman Thomas Remick. Like those two stories, &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; cleverly informs an important contempory issue by using an easy, refreshing presentation. Hats off to Grisham for being so clever to recognize the irony that Americans would love to skip the hassles of Christmas and therefore will read about skipping Christmas but, in the end, will show their true colors by buying his &quot;Skipping Christmas&quot; ----- for Christmas.
6301174240|5.0|Oh My God!! I love this Movie, it is my all time favourite! Michael is the best at acting and the kids in it are cute too! But MJ rox the world! I loved the story line and Michael Jackson is just so hot! I would really recommend this movie to little kids, teenagers, adults, well anyone! This movie is a MUST SEE for any fan of Michael Jackson!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|Wow I was so surprised by this album. I am also not a Christina Aguilera fan, but I cannot complain about anything on this album!  In fact I was even more surprised by her new public image, it was a bit risqu and trashy. Her appearance alone made me judge her as a person and musician, I wasn't intersted in buying her new CD at all. A month after the new album release I started hearing the good buzz about some of the songs and even heard a few on TV. Gee am I a hypocrite! Goes to show you can't judge a book by it's cover, the important thing is what is on the inside. This is a grown woman singing from her heart and from her experiences! Track 18- I'm OK,  so moving I want to cry every time I listen to it. This is a great buy!

B00006LI4S|4.0|Aging guitar master of Pink Floyd puts on an acoustic show that leaves you wanting more. The set list included many of the fan favorites re-worked into a very intimate soft sound. His voice faulters a few times, and his guitar playing sometimes gets overshadowed by lofty expectations of his fans, but DON'T let that spoil anything for you. Go out and get this DVD. I enjoyed all of the songs. The &quot;non-Floyd&quot; songs add so much to this concert. Digital transfer was a bit grainy in spots, but the sound is GREAT. The Home Video and Spare Digits section is a great extra...Plus: Pink shows up to sing Comfortably Numb.
074322454X|5.0|After viewing last year the HBO special on the Dish Network I was moved by the film. My father was in the Canadian Army During WWII and although he is no longer with us..I can now really appreciate what they all did for us from every country. Band of Brothers made me cry and feel what my father went through. It was an emotional roller coaster that made me proud of what they all did. This book is excellent and so is the video which I purchased earlier this year. I also just pruchased the DVD set.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Very Good sound.  Stimulates creativity in my studio.  Bought it with Dianna Krall Live in Paris and I am enjoying them both.
B00005221M|3.0|I am a huge fan of the VHS version of this film -- breathtaking, romantic, epic, and nuanced, it's one of the tapes I'm slowly replacing with DVDs. When I first saw &quot;Director's Expanded Version,&quot; I thought, &quot;Oh, there's a second version of the film on the DVD with additional scenes,&quot; or I thought maybe there was a special feature that included deleted scenes. No such luck. There is ONE version on the DVD, and it's a case of Should Have Left Well Enough Alone. The extended version expands scenes that didn't need to be extended, causing the pace to slow and exclamations from me at the TV -- &quot;They cut out of that scene earlier for a REASON!&quot; There's a whole added scene where Cora and Alice and the gang arrive at the fort that's under seige. Already, the film kind of slowed down too much for me at that point in the VHS version, but it was forgivable. But with the added scene it comes to a screeching halt. Plus, you just don't need the added scene to get what's going on. It screams of, &quot;Gee, we had all this good battlefield footage, let's use it.&quot; But the alteration that had me practically sobbing was the deletion of the Clannad song. You know the one -- when the brothers are pursuing Magua up the rock-faced mountain to rescue Alice and Cora. That scene is one of my favorites not just in this movie, but in any movie, and now it's ruined. I'm not using hyperbole here -- I mean it. I doubt I will watch the DVD version again. I will simply plug in my old, ratty VHS and enjoy the movie -- the infinitely better version of the movie -- that the director has seen fit to alter.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Many people, far more eloquent than myself have heaped well deserved praise on AKUS (Alison Krauss and Union Station) so I'll not even attempt to add any additional comment to their considerable and varied talents as individuals and as a group.  I will try to explain their appeal for those who are new to this musical phenomena.  I've always been an avid listener of music, particularly rock and roll.  Other than Clint BLack and Willie Nelson, I've had no interest in Country or Bluegrass.  But if you like and appreciate music, regardless of its genre, youll like, likely love AKUS.  They are not Bluegrass and they are not Country.  They are really impossible to categorize.  They are<BR>wonderfully talented artists/musicians who collectively far exceed the sum of their individual abilities.  This live CD I think captures their near incomprehensible musical and emotional reach.  I waited for this cd to appear in stores as did many other fans. Its what youd expect from them.  Its beautiful, brilliant, classy and very entertaining.  Alison can sing and the guys can play.  Buy it.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I am a huge Alison Krauss &amp; Union Station fan, but this is my NEW FAVORITE. It is brimming over with warmth, comraderie, generosity, and an exciting energy from the live performance. These masterful musicians are very simply unsurpassed. I am in awe.
B00006LLLN|5.0|Let me start by saying that I'm not generally a great fan of live albums. All too often they come across as little more than a cynical cash-in, in which all the best bits are spoilt by bad production, audience hysteria or (in the case of the traditional live rock album) 10 minute unaccompanied solos by the drummer, the bass-player, and even sometimes (heaven help us!) the singer.<br />Of course there are a few miraculous standout live sets. Some artistes were made for live music; a theatre audience draws out of them some deep primal magic that the studio cannot capture. Most of the jazz greats were like this: John Coltrane, Miles Davies and so on. Elvis had it; so did Joni Mitchell and Bruce Springsteen. Their best live albums made your heart ache that you weren't there yourself, even as you were uplifted by the feeling that in a strange sense you were there yourself.<BR> <BR>Now we have AKUS Live. And while the great FM-listening masses may not put them in the same class as the King or the Boss, this latest album has some of that same rare charisma. It's very reasonably priced; the sound is outstanding; the performances are dazzling, and the audience presence is just enough to communicate a sense of excitement without swamping anything. Above all, you get about 100 minutes of Alison and the extended Soggy Bottom family at their incisive best.<br />They know how to play a song live, these guys - enough like the studio performance that you don't ever get the urge to go, \\"Hey! That's not right\\" (a common enough fault with live work, you don't need me to tell you), yet with enough elbow-room for that extra free spark of creative genius to shine out. This is rivetting, gorgeous, exciting live artistry that makes you want to be there. <br />The song selection could hardly be bettered. Inevitably you'll wish something had been left out for your special favorite. Mine is `Daylight', and many people would have gone for `Momma Cried'. But hey, this is incredibly generous andvirtually everything you really need is here (including Ron Block's awesome solo hit, `Faraway Land', and of course the obligatory `Man of Constant Sorrow').<br />My final comment is this: You need have no fear that by buying `Live' you are simply duplicating songs you already have. In fact, after just a few spins, these performances have become the reference versions in my mind, and the original studio cuts now sound relative tame and muted in comparison. To so redefine a set of songs, that the concert version becomes the standard by which the original studio recording is judged, is a rare achievement. Joni and Bruce did it repeatedly, and so did Neil Young. I think AKUS can hold their heads up in that company.

B00006CXXU|3.0|Christina Aguilera's highly anticipated second album is finally here after 1999's impressive self titled debut. A moment all of Christina's biggest fans like myself have been waiting for. However, after owning this cd for over a week and a half now, I can't help but feel a little disappointed with this dreary material. If maturing artistically means abandoning your roots and all aspects of fun, I'll take Britney any day (which I would anyway). This sad and sleep inducing album feels like Mariah Carey left overs and while Christina's voice is a gift that no one can deny, she shouldn't be rushing so quickly to become the next Mariah or Whitney. She's only 21 years old and if this music reflects what's gone on in her life over the past three years, I'll need Prozac by the time her next cd comes out. <BR>I can admire what she was trying to do. I think everyone wants to grow and exceed expectations, but with 20 tracks - many of them 5 to 6 minutes long - she took way too long to get her message across and the cd is simply boring. If you're looking for any fun songs on this cd like Come On Over (All I Want Is You) or Lady Marmalade you'll have to look elsewhere. The only songs you'll find on this cd are a few traditional ballads, piano bar style blues numbers that work better than Nyquil, a couple rock songs that makes you forget about her pretending she's Britney and makes you think she's trying to be Pink and a few up tempo hip hop songs that help remind you that she's a skank. <BR>It probably seems like I'm being extremely cruel, but I actually love Christina when she's being herself and being real. This is best heard in previous songs including What A Girl Wants, I Turn To You and Miracle. Also, there are several songs on this cd that pass for good, if not great such as Can't Hold Us Down, Fighter, Infatuation, Make Over, Beautiful and A Voice Within. All in all the cd is not bad, it's just not what we all came to know and love from X-Tina. And with so many artists abandoning the sound that made them famous, is it really fair to say Britney is the hypocrite? That's just my opinion. I hope everyone enjoys the album. There's certainly enough songs on it for everyone to find something they like. As for me, the name of my review says it all.
B00005QDW5|5.0|This CD includes some of Pink Floyd's best as well as covering a good amount of their time with Syd Barrett. Each song is intertwined with unusual, Pink-Floydish sounds which fit perfectly between each song. One who is not familiar with Pink Floyds music will find this almost like a complete dissappointment. At least that's what I thought when I bought the CD in January of 2002. I thought it was horrible. I didn't know a good majority of the songs, nor did I know much behind the band's disposition with Syd Barrett and that he was their main inspiration and huant throughout their history as a group. After listening to this CD for a 3rd or 4th time, it came to me as classical music. Beautifully inspired are the songs, and wonderfully inventive are the lyrics.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera defys music barriers and genres with this album. This is her best work to date. Xtina explores writing that includes both mellow and thought provoking songs. &quot;Beautiful&quot; is a wonderful song that we women need to hear more. &quot;Cruz&quot; and &quot;Makeover&quot; are wonderful to drive to or listen to and daydream with as well. We already all love &quot;Dirrty&quot;! &quot;I'm ok&quot; is a shockingly vulnerable song that describes her childhood past. Christina's smooth and soulful voice will reserve her a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame someday! She is one of the great artists of this generation. This album is rare in that is blends many styles of music and every single track is fabulous! You gotta buy it!
B000002MI4|5.0|This is one of the few albums I have listened to many times. I highly recommend it to people who (like me) love classical music, but not the formality of an operatic vocal approach, and who also like pop, but not mindless drivel. <br />Elvis' voice blends wonderfully with the strings which are played in a first rate professional manner by a group which has obviously played together for quite some time.<br />The songs are both whimsical and serious. They could be considered pop music or art songs and in both the lyrics and the music you can hear something new each time you listen.<br />It doesn't get any better than that.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina did a wonderful job in creating this album. She explored different genre of music and did not sell us short. There are quite of few rock tracks along with some R&B tracks and ballads ranging from a soft rock flavor to R&B. The latter track of this album, \\"It's OK\\" is where Christina did her best vocally. One song that is very contagious is \\"Get Mine Get Yours.\\" This sexual song about \\"getting your groove on and leave\\" has a classic R&B flavor with a splash of Lenny Kravitz. Other favorites are \\"Walk Away,\\" \\"Loving Me For Me,\\" and of course \\"Dirrty.\\"
B00006CXXU|4.0|Forget anything you ever thought you knew about Christina Aguilera and throw it out the window. She has shed her \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" pop girl image for something much more daring, revealing, and i have to say admirable. Although I don't understand why maturing musically seems to mean taking more clothing off, the music and soul Christina packs into her newest album \\"STRIPPED\\" along with her killer vocals are proof that she has more to her then meets the eye.<BR>It's a shame that \\"dirrty\\" was the released dingle from \\"stripped\\" because it gives off misleading ideas about the nature of her album, as does the title of her new record \\"stripped\\". \\"STRIPPED\\" could infer being stripped in the physical sense however her album's content is proof that she is stripping herself emotionally. The albm is packed with \\"love yourself\\" anthems, catchy beats and soulful lyrics.<br />I think \\"stripped\\" is evidence that Christina is not another Britney Spears and i think her talent really shines on this album. She has nothing to hide, is not pretending, and is blatantly honest and soul-baring on this album. She's got a killer body, beautiful face, honest soul, and a voice to go with it. I truly think that Christina has outshone Britney all along, but with the release of \\"stripped\\" i think she has really come into her own. She gets an A in my book.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I remember when this movie was in the theatres. I absolutely loved it the first time around and I love it even more now with the new song &quot;Human Again&quot; added. The DVD is full of awesome extras, my favorite being the full length documentary of how the film was made. This movie is one of the two best Disney films that have ever been made. The other one being the Little Mermaid. These two films brought the excellence of Disney to it's absolute best.

B000002I57|5.0|Milt Jackson and John Coltrane complement one another marvelously in this collection of quintet recordings from 1959. The rhythm trio features Hank Jones on piano, assisted by Paul Chambers on bass and Connie Kay on drums. Jackson is here in familiar territory with a group that isn't far from MJQ. The differences are Coltrane and the interplay. The disc commences with a bonus track, the standard \\"Stairway to the Stars.\\" Here is Coltrane in his best ballad form, exercising restraint and what is as close to lyrical as he gets. Milt Jackson spins his filligrees, nets of sound, as usual, and Coltrane answers seemingly from a distance, with clarity. The next track is Bags' \\"The Late Late Blues,\\" a simple theme that Coltrane explores in his legendary sheets of sound. His clarity is such that you can hear the patterns evolve within the sheet. Paul Chambers' bass is prominent both in its steady line and in solo. \\"Bags & Trane\\" begins with a simple call and response. Bags' intricate solo is followed by Trane's brief statement, again exemplary of his improvisational skill. Hank Jones piano solo precedes Paul Chambers' arco solo followed by traded breaks by Bags and Trane. \\"Three Little Words\\" is a mid-tempo tune that cooks. It begins with Bags' statement of the theme and then Trane establishes the groundwork for his solo and goes to the invention--arabesque variations built on the theme. Trane's solo here is exemplary--worth studying for insights into his method. Jackson's extended solo illustrates his inventiveness and Hank Jones continues into traded fours between Trane, Connie Kay, and Bags. Which leads one to extoll Connie Kay's gifts. Here is a consummate professional at work. He is delicate and tasteful when necessary, but he swings explosively as well. \\"The Night We Called It a Day\\" is a quiet ballad, but Jackson's lyrical solo and Coltrane's lengthy invention are masterful. Again, Trane's solo is an object lesson in his method. But these guys can blow the roof off. That's apparent in Dizzy Gillespie's \\"Be-Bop\\" where Bags starts off at breakneck speed and Coltrane follows suit--probably the only tenor player aside from Johnny Griffin who blows as hard and fast as Bird with coherence. This is sheets of sound--a style that can become \\"cerebral\\" that euphemism for boring when you want your jazz visceral. The Jones solo arrives apace with Chambers and Kay cooking in the background down to Bags and Trane trading breaks. Cerebral doesn't happen here. A hard bop classic. The remaining tracks, \\"Blues Legacy\\" and \\"Centerpiece\\" follow suit. The first is a simple call and response blues riff with some gigantic solos. The last is an old favorite of mine, but despite Bags' wonderful solo it doesn't have Jon Hendricks and Annie Ross, alas. Nevertheless, this is a very good CD. Highly recommended, too.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I love this CD. I wasn't a huge fan of Christina's until I saw her on MTV Stripped in NYC and her Diary on MTV. She is so much more than what she wears. I found out she is a strong and talented woman who knows how to write good music. Her I'm Ok song truly touched my heart and I cried with her when I heard it. If you want an awesome CD that has different sounds to it this is the one to buy!

B00006LHYC|4.0|Laura Pausini's first album in English has some wonderful moments on it, most notably the sensual ballads &quot;I Need Love&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing You Do.&quot; The latter song particularly shows off the sweetness and vulnerability in Pausini's style that charms her audiences. The hard-driving &quot;Every Day is Monday,&quot; known as &quot;Un Error de Los Grandes&quot; in Spanish, is also terrific, establishing that she can handle a driving rocker. <br />The album's only real flaw is that overall it is a bit unfocused, moving between different musical styles without really committing to any. Her Spanish albums are much more consistent. Still, it's a pleasing debut, and I hope she achieves the same success in English she knows throughout the Spanish-speaking world.
0385474547|2.0|I had to read this book for my junior year in English. It's not a difficult rnovel if you can go for awhile being bored out of your mind. Well, OK. It's wasn't *that* boring, but I still would have preferred to read something with more content and less inconsistancies. <BR>Achebe tries way too hard to insert symbolisism and make himself come off as a talented writer, when really, he's just pulling out tricks. Not to say Achebe isn't a talented writer. I've read a few of his essays and they are quite good, but Things Fall Apart is not one of the better book I've read.<BR>Okonkwo is an agressive, sexest and disgustingly manish man, and it's absurd that people can even suggest that he obtained hero status in this story
0767020308|1.0|My wife and I enjoyed this on A&amp;E and bought a copy on VHS as soon as it became available.  The production is extremely well done and is true in spirit to the novel.  Our tape is now worn out and it seemed like a good idea to pick it up on DVD.  This transfer, unfortunately, is extremely pale.  Lit backgrounds and outdoor scenes are washed out and do not balance well with foreground detail.  It's a shame.
0783229372|3.0|\\"Hindenburg\\" is a pretty good film that unfortunately falls a bit flat. The concept, sets, effects, and the cast are all excellent, but there just seems to be some element missing.<br />The cast is populated with famous faces from yesterday, a standard practice in all 70's disaster movies. Here we have the incomparable Gig Young, Burgess Meredith, Charles Durning, Richard A. Dysart, Robert Clary (late from \\"Hogan's Heroes\\" at this point), future Star Trek actor Rene Auberjonois, and Roy Thinnes. And of course, we have Anne Bancroft and George C. Scott. Scott and Thinnes really do their best, too (look at their confrontation scene when Thinnes' character mentions Scott's dead son!).<br />Still, the cast just seems to be shuffling through this one, with little or no true tension generated, other than an emergency repair by some crewmen who must venture out onto the hull of the ship (an act that was accomplished, but never happened on Hindenburg's last trip).<br />The end result is somewhat sparse, even strangely emotionless for the most part. Despite the overall blandness in tone, the film is compelling to watch anyway (thanks in large part to the cast and the effects).<br />Knowing as we do what will eventually happen at Lakehurst, one cannot help but marvel at the ironic line the Hindenburg's Captain Proust utters several times throughout the course of film. In regards to the United States' bad luck with dirigibles he remarks, \\"It's no wonder they lose all their airships.\\"<br />The ending of the film seems to mystify some viewers today, but it is, in reality, an incredibly artistic, stylish (and daring), choice on the part of director Robert Wise and the producers. Capturing the action in black and white, with actual newsreel footage of the disaster added, and freezing images in place, Wise makes a stunning montage of the disaster and of the cast members as they flee the impending peril. Even though the end result is only partially effective, the montage makes an artistic statement nevertheless, the kind that Hollywood avoids today.

0553260111|1.0|I bought this book a few days after seeing the movie, which I really liked.  At first the book was OK, not great, but fine.  But then Marie entered.  Personaly, she annoyed the hell out of me.  She acted like no human being I have ever met.  For example, she gets kidnaped by Jason, held hostage by him, he theatens her with a gun, he hits her several times, another man rapes her, and a few days later she's all ready for a relationship ...  Now if I were her, I think I'd be developing some serious trust isues, not jumping some injured spy.This Ludlum guy obviously doesn't know much about women.  Not to mention all the \\"My love, you cannot leave me\\" [stuff].  I had to stop reading it about 200 pages in.  Do yourself a favor; skip the book and see the movie.(Matt Damon kicks ... in the movie).

0441003257|5.0|This book is a wonderous blend of satire, fantasy and awesome dialog. Though it was originally published in 1990, this fantastic work translates remarkably well to today; including its reference to the musicians on the Titanic that stayed to the end. A demon and an angel join forces to stop the apocalypse when they realize that earth is much more fun of a  place to be than heaven or hell.  The Antichrist is a boy about as devilish as the average boy his age. The Four Horseman of the Apocalypse (except for Death) function in society as normal people and as they ride to the end, on motorcycles, they wear jackets declaring them as true Hell's Angels. <br />Good Omens does tend to drag a bit and requires a more mature sense of humor. But if you can appreciate the artistry with which the characters communicate, you'll be laughing every second with this book. The beginning grabs your attention and if you have patience for the slightly less riveting middle, the events leading to the ultimate climax in the book just come one after the other becoming increasingly hilarious. I recommend this book to anyone that enjoys satire, dialog made poetry or just a good laugh and can handle the innumerable sub-plots without getting confused.
B00005U1YO|5.0|Gets 5 stars because they do what they do so well.  There's not a single false step on this album.  I listen to it 'cause it trips my head without getting repetative and boring.  The Chemicals know how to change it up. SURRENDER was my favorite Chemicals' album, but I think COME WITH US takes it up a notch with &quot;Come With Us&quot; and &quot;It Began in Afrika.&quot;  SURRENDER had more emphasis on song structure and COME WITH US is a bit more intense.  <br />Songs like &quot;Galaxy Bounce&quot; were born to praise life get you gettin' down.  I don't have a clue where that funky break came from but it's sick.  The Beth Orton sung &quot;The State We're In&quot; is a deep shimmer, sparkling gorgeously.  The other guest vocalist is Richard Ashcroft who shines as well on &quot;The Test&quot; which is more like a conventional rock song and very good but a little less dazzling than the rest of the album which can grab your mind and take off with it if you let it.

B00000099Y|5.0|Honestly speaking,this was the first album that my younger brother bought that i actually listened to.it was like sheer amazement for me when i heard tool's music (the very powerful forty six &amp; 2) being played on our cd player which usually burns with RATM cds.Every song is masterfully written and it seems that no other band could rival the riveting power of its sound.

0802130208|5.0|\\"A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES\\" is colorful, literary satire of the highest order. Still widely read, the very mention of the title brings a knowing smile to many. How sad that Toole was taken from us by his own tormented hand, how lucky readers are to have this brilliant book to remember him by.<br />A few years back, when I was working on my novel, \\"Life Askew,\\" a friend who'd read a few chapters pressed his copy of \\"Dunces\\" against my chest and insisted I read it immediately. My book and I were posessed by the spirit of John Kennedy Toole, he'd said. Of course, I was flattered to be compared to a Pulitzer Prize winner, and saddened to learn of the story of how the book was posthumously published by his mother.<br />Now, years later, my novel is done and I'm convinced my friend was right; \\"Life Askew\\" and \\"Dunces\\" are cut from the same cloth.

0553062182|1.0|Okay, first the good:  Yes, there are sensitive people in the world, and this book makes it okay to be one of them.  Now, the bad:  Sinking into your sensitivity is not always the best way to handle it.  For more practical, less self-defeating hints, see Riso and Hudson's books on the Enneagram (Like me, you may be an Enneagram 4.  You may also be an Enneagram 2, 5, or, possibly, 6.  You may be a 1 who has gone in the direction of a 4).  In any case, don't buy Peter D'Adamo's advice that blood type equals personality.  Yes, his Live Right For Your Type is an excellent eating plan that leaves me feeling great.  But this sensitive person is an &quot;aggressive&quot; Type O!
B00005MP58|4.0|This version of Pride and Prejudice was lavishly filmed and is visually beautiful. The story is quite faithful to Austen's classic in dialogue and story -- there is an occasional added scene or trimmed scene, but most fit in well. I thought the final scene with Lydia, which was created for this movie, was not true to Austen's spirit, but fit into the movie well enough.<br />This movie is a funny and romantic chick flick, no questions about it. My only real complaints stem from my dissatisfaction as a Jane Austen fan. There are aspects throughout the movie where they Just Didn't Get It. It's one thing for a writer or director to add his/her own spin, but in many cases I think they were just oblivious. This story revolves around the principles of propriety and true ladylike and gentlemanly behavior in Regency England. The main character (Elizabeth Bennett), however, is far too giddy on the one hand and sullen on the other to fit the part of true lady that the role demands. A more minor screw-up is that Jane is supposed to be a beauty, and Lizzie is supposed to have a beauty that sneaks up on you, but isn't immediately obvious. Here Jane seems plane and Lizzie is beautiful. And a little too old for the role, too. (Not so ridiculously too old as the Emma Thompson/Kate Winslet Sense and Sensibility that came out a few years ago, mind you.)<br />Despite these criticisms, the movie is entertaining, beautiful, and very enjoyable. The use of language, mostly straight from the book, is a delight. For people who don't get distracted by a giddy Regency lady or an only very slight straying from the novel, I would give 5 stars out of 5. For overly picky people like myself, I would still recommend it with only trivial reservations.<br />There was a BBC television version in the late 70's or early 80's that caught Jane Austen's intentions much better than this version. It's not nearly so beautiful a film, though, so I'd almost recommend getting both versions. If you find it anywhere, it's worth a look.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first bought this CD because of the song, &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; as I enjoyed hearing it every time it came on the radio.  After listening to this CD several times, I found that I love all of the songs.  There's something about Norah Jones' style - jazzy, smokey, sometimes a bit country - whatever it is, it's perfect for work as well as home.  I've turned several friends on this CD and they all love it! My husband loved it so much that I had to buy a copy of my own for work!  Definitely an artist that I will follow!
B00004WG2X|5.0|This BBC version of Pride and Prejudice is as true to Austen's work as I could imagine. It is for lovers of Austen and of Regency England: Jane is beautiful and sweet; Lizzie is a true lady, with notable eyes and a beauty that grows on you rather than being immediately obvious; the manners are true to the time and consistent with Austen's presentation.<br />Everyone seems to be comparing this version to the more recent A&amp;E version with Colin Firth, so I'll do so as well. The A&amp;E version is likely to appeal to a wider audience than this version. The newer version is lusciously filmed. It had a much larger budget than the older version, which shows in its sets and exteriors. The acting in the A&amp;E version is of the modern, realistic school, allowable by the more modern film and sound techniques. The older version is more theatrical, like old movies and, more particularly, like the great old BBC series such as I Claudius and Upstairs Downstairs. Modern audiences may find the pace of the older version slow and the camera too fixed, but to me the story and sensibilities portrayed are far more important.<br />The A&amp;E version sticks to the basic story and much of the dialogue of Jane Austen's novel, but is too insensible to the customs and attitudes of the times for me. A&amp;E's Lizzie has little of the decorum so important to the premise of the plot -- that she is a true lady. Instead, she appears either giddy or sullen for the majority of the film. Modern viewers may be able to relate better to her, but that isn't the point. The book is a humorous romance which pivots on the worthyness of truly ladylike and gentlemanly behavior. No one in the A&amp;E version, except perhaps Lizzie's aunt and uncle, would meet the standards of the time, and the minor characters whose foibles in the book were amusing illustrations of lesser quality behavior have been turned into ridiculous, in-your-face caricatures. Perhaps the creators were afraid that audiences wouldn't be capable of understanding subtlety?<br />A&amp;E also took the liberty of adding scenes, dialogue, and in my opinion characterizations, which were utterly untrue to the book. The final scene with Lydia, for instance, has nothing to do with Austen's story. Austen may have considered Lydia a thoughtless fool, but not the wanton creature depicted. And Lizzie's confession to Jane that her feelings for Mr. Darcy began to change when she saw his estate is a slap in the face to my sense of romance.<br />My summary is that if you love Jane Austen, you will like the BBC 1980 version best. If you only like Jane Austen, and would prefer an easy-on-the-eyes movie to an accurate one, then you'll prefer the A&amp;E version.
0446677450|4.0|This is an very good book for the financially illiterate (that's me before reading this book)! It teaches about ways to make your money work for you. It is a useful book with lots of practical advice that make a lot of sense and is also a very enjoyable book to read. In a way this book worked for me, it gave me insights about my attitudes towards money and my patterns of spending which were not working for me! And although I did not become a millionaire (yet!), I handle my finances in a much better way. If you don't know ways to save and invest your money, or you're afraid to start, this book will be very helpful.
B00000IOSU|5.0|Mirrorball was the first CD that I bought by Sarah McLachlan and I wasn't dissappointed. I really enjoy Sarah work. She is able to do different stlyes of singing and make it work. My only problem with the CD is that it didn't included all the songs from the concert. I don't know about other fans, but I would pay a little more for all of the songs.
B000053V9F|3.0|First Oliver Stone's \\"JFK\\" should get high marks for a great cast from Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthow to Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. And at least 10 other world class actors grace this film.  But is there any truth to the version of events as depicted in this film?<br />  The title \\"JFK\\" unfortunately is a misnomer, as the film is not about JFK at all, but about the assassination.  And this film bombards you with so many facts and scenarios your head will be spinning more than Linda Blair.  The main flaw is that the film simply offers too many scenarios and crams them into a film that is too long (189 minutes/add 20 for director's cut).<br />The most compelling scene is that of X (Donald Sutherland) as he gives Jim Garrison (Kevin Costner) details of \\"Black Operations\\".<br />As X says, \\"noone said aloud 'let's kill Kennedy', but it was understood and the conspiracy took shape in the traditional form of a black op\\".  Unfortunately this doesn't gel with reality.<br /><br />  But the film is actually focused on Jim Garrison, the New Orleans attorney who investigated such unlikely characters as Clay Shaw and David Ferry.  The final court case he puts together is laughably inept...basically the only evidence he has against Shaw is the Zapruder film.<br />  A laughably implausible film.
B000002L99|5.0|HELLO BABY!  When David lee Roth left Van Halen in 1985 many people, and die hard fans, thought the band was dead, but in that year the Halen boys hired the man known as the Red Rocker and recorded the album that is 5150. Fans got the new start of Van halen, Mach 2, Van Hagar. This album is totally killer and all the songs are cool, but one little weak point is the song Inside.  My favorite song on the album would have to be the title track, 5150, if your a fan that really loved David lee roth but hated Sammy hagar, this might not be the album for you, but you should give it a listen because it's sure ... worth it!
B00005R8FI|5.0|John Mayall has had a long and amazing career as England's Blues Godfather.  Having a career that goes back to the 1950's and doesn't appear to be ending any time in the future, John Mayall has explored just about every avenue that the Blues have to offer.  His bands are legendary, featuring the cream of Britian's young Blues players.<br />This particular album, recorded live, features a straight set of acoustic Blues.  With a simple line-up that includes a guitar, bass and flute/sax player, Mayall plays one great song after another.  All of the songs are long enough to explore that song's potential.  Mayall plays the harmonica with both ease and authority.  The CD's final song, \\"Room To Move\\" is an absolute classic.  Mayall must have known that this was going to be a must-have album for harmonica players, he's even included the key of harmonica for each song.<br />Any self-respecting harmonica should have this CD in their collection.
B00003CXTG|1.0|This is what you get when your target audience is a big fan of \\"Anne of Green Gables\\".  No intelligent man or woman should be forced to suffer through this horrible depiction of one the most epic events in world history.  All of the action scenes would have been just at home in a PBS WWII episode.  These three individuals were supposed to represent the american people??  pleeeeeeease!!!
B00006L3S3|3.0|With Mind Games John Lennon put his wares for the crowd to inspect. Like every arts and crafts fair, there are a number of outstanding pieces on Mind Games but there's also plenty of material that needed work. The title track is like a fuzzy polaroid of the best songs on Imagine and Plastic Ono Band; you have the impression something important is there you're just not sure what it is exactly. The arrangement makes the song come to life. While the sentiments were more direct and succint on Lennon's first two post-Beatles solo albums, they were also couched in simpler arrangements. Every song on Mind Games (even the weaker tracks) is Lennon's shot back at critics that bemoaned what appeared a loss of the Lennon/McCartney craft. Mind Games is Lennon's Ram; some of it is aural wallpaper with pictures of ducks on it. There's no crime in creating less than compelling background muzak--the irony is that Lennon had taken McCartney to task for the very same \\"flaw\\" nearly two years before... Like many of the icons of the 60's, Mind Games is less than the sum of it's parts. It recalls the glory of Lennon's best work but also the weakness of his worst as well. Although not as emotionally powerful as Walls and Bridges (Gerswin meets primal scream therapy), it has a number of moments that resonante with Lennon's wit and love of music.
B000077VPU|5.0|Stupendously great concert from April 1992.  I've owned it on laserdisc since 1993 and I've been hoping a DVD release would be forthcoming!<br />This concert is culled from a day-long Freddie Mercury tribute/benefit concert that took place about 5 or 6 months after Freddie died.  The first half is largely devoted to a number of bands doing mostly Queen covers, though we only see a truncated version of it.  Then, the REAL fireworks start!  Brian May, Roger Taylor, and John Deacon take the stage and lead a Who's Who of musicians and singers through a lengthy set of Queen material.  Robert Plant sings \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", Metallica's James Hetfield sings \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\", Gary Cherone of Extreme absolutely rocks the joint with \\"Hammer To Fall\\", Roger Daltrey sings \\"I Want It All\\", Seal does \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\", Def Leppard returns, and we also get Lisa Stansfield, Elton John, Axl Rose, Paul Young, David Bowie, members of Mott the Hoople, and Liza Minneli closes the show with \\"We Are The Champions.\\"<br />The show runs in excess of 3 hours, and the DVD release promises to have extra material not on the laser and VHS versions.<br />The audio recording of the show is stellar, and the video photography is crisp and clear.  After you watch this you'll wish you'd been there.<br /><br />Best of all, you get a renewed sense of how strong Queen's songwriting and performing talents were (and still are).  And all of the artists singing in Freddie's place give it their all and make the versions their own, all without detracting from Freddie's original version.<br /><br />You're an IDIOT if you don't get this concert DVD!
B00006L7XQ|5.0|What can I say about this CD. It looks like a testemony from Johnny Cash and it probably is.<br />He starts of with a song writen by himself about Judgment day, and the man himself going around and judging fear and hard. The last song is &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; and I could not hold my tears back when I heard him sing it.<br />Not only do he sing his own songs on this record, but he sings songs of masters like Beatles, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Depeche Mode, The Eagles and Hank Williams. But Cash sings them as they were his own, and when you listen you do not remember that someone else has done them before.<br />If you don't have any other Johnny Cash album, please buy this one at least.
0380789035|5.0|This book seems to have everything: old &quot;gods&quot; fighting new &quot;gods&quot;, the dead walking, animals that talk, temporal displacement, eerie dreams, etc.. It sounds all quite confusing, and in the hands of a writer with a lesser talent, it certainly could be. This author, however, takes firm hold of his plot, and moves it along swiftly. It's a tale that reveals the fate of &quot;gods&quot; whose followers stop believing in them. They are forgotten, but they don't just disappear. They take mundane jobs, becoming laborers, taxi drivers, grifters, petty thieves, etc.. Then new &quot;gods&quot; come along displacing them, and these new &quot;gods&quot; want the old ones to just go away. The plot is pretty straightforward, although at times it doesn't appear that way. The author always knows where he is going, and doesn't get lost along the way. The writing is of high quality, and the character development, even the relatively minor ones, is first rate. It's a book the reader will either instantly like, or hate. I liked it, and recommend it highly.
B00006JDVV|4.0|OK...so this isn't exactly Shakespeare or CITIZEN KANE, but REIGN OF FIRE is great fun. I really enjoyed the burnt-out, ashen atmosphere of this post-apocalyptic world, the gritty people, the castle ruins, and the lack of color. Christian Bale was a very sympathetic character, and Matt McConaughey is at his over-the-top best. This isn't the ... heartthrob I hated in romance movies like THE WEDDING PLANNER; here he's buff, tattooed, bald, and really PO'd. He looks great, and his character is definately someone to cheer for, as you can tell he's playing his machismo down with some sly tongue-in-cheek asides. I also appreciated that this movie was pure action - there was a pretty girl in the cast that could have led to a really cheesy love triangle, but it thankfully never happened. The dragon FX are the best I've seen. So, if you're looking two hours of watching things blow up real good, you've found you're movie here.
0316666343|5.0|Susie Salmon is a normal teenager in AnyTown USA, until a walk home through a cornfield one night changes her life forever.  She is raped, dismembered, and lastly discarded of by a neighbor.  This event changes the lives of her family members outstandingly. From heavan, she now much watch her mother cheat on her father, her sister grow into a woman (something she will never do), the love of her life move on, her younger brother almost completely forget her, and her killer live with no remorse.  Through these trials, Susie ultimately learns how to love, forgive, and to come to peace with her murder.<BR>This novel was exceptionally interesting and thought provoking. I can honestly say that I found it hard to put \\"The Lovely Bones\\" down once I began to travel through Susie Salmon's life, murder and rape. Alice Sebold amazingly created the story of this young teenager with such compassion and understanding.  Also, having read \\"Lucky\\" her autobiography beforehand, I found it interesting to notice the parallels between the author's own life story and that of her young heroine's. If one can read this book and not be touched, they must truly be without a soul, for Sebold projects the horrors of her own rape through this compelling novel
B00003CXE6|2.0|The film shows Imperial Rome winning a battle in the Black Forest. But wasn't that one of the few battle Rome lost? Rome's economy was based on slavery; they had to continually conquer new lands to replenish the cheap labor needed for their plantations, owned by the rich and politically connected ruling class. Sort of like today's corporations, except now the conquest of foreign lands means there is no need to import cheap labor; they send the factories there.<br />After the battle we see some high level intrigue among the leaders. The speech of a tired old Caesar (\\"End the corruption, Restore the Republic\\") suggests the leader is senile. Handing power to a popular military leader is the antithesis of a republic! And so the stage is set for personal conflict, a simplified way to explain economic and political conflict.<br />The General rejects the new Emperor's hand, and is rejected in turn. He escapes execution, his family does not. Somehow he winds up in North Africa (?) without crossing the sea. (Does his travails remind you of 'Yojimbo'?) Then the gladiator scenes follow - to remind you of professional sports? He is told that popularity makes the star, not statistics!<br />The special effects recreate ancient cities, but the lack of movement in the backgrounds tell. Do some of the scenes remind you of 'Star Wars\\"? Or some of those costume imports from forty-plus years ago? Like many other films, the action picks up when the story line lags. Do rulers still use circuses to entertain and distract the masses from their problems? Only in other countries.<br />Caesar and Maximus both expire, but they don't say what their replacements do. This seems like the sickest movie since 'Silence of the Lambs', and appears to have done as well at the box office. Does this movie have any redeeming social values?
B00004R99L|5.0|Objectively as a real Disney fan, this is the marriage of a timeless story which has passed the test of time and one of Disney's best animation jobs.<br />The new DVD version is a brilliant study of shape, form, and motion. The sound quality has never been better. As is true of most DVD versions, this is probably the best copy of this movie which is currently available.<br />As for the Lewis Carroll craziness.....I love Alice. It is as much fun as it was when I was a kid. The story is so charming, amusing, and immaginative. I've enjoyed real-life versions that have been filmed with actors, but the luxury of animation really provides a platform for the absurdity of Alice's adventures. Make yourelf and the kids happy, and get this one. Heck, you don't even need to have kids to enjoy this!
B00006YXE4|5.0|This CD and DVD is just amazing.  After listining to it for the first time and watching the DVD over and over and over again, the only thing that can come to mind is that this is amazing.  The first disk of the CD is mainly Clapton doing some acoustic work.  Key to the Highway is great with just Clapton and his Martin.  The versions of Tears in Heaven and Bell Bottom Blues are great as well.  After some of the acoustic work, he gets to the meat and potatoes of what makes Clapton great.  Badge and I want a little girl are just amazing.  And then there is Layla.  It is an awesome song, and  it is even better live.  And to top it off there is Sunshine of your love and a suprisingly good rendition of somewhere over the rainbow.  All in all, this is a very good disk.  I personally liked this better than Unplugged and 24 Nights.  If you are a Clapton fan, pick it up.  If you aren't, pick it up anyway because this is a good place to start to learn about the greatest guitar player of our time.
0792835700|2.0|This really should have been a good movie. I love most of Vincente Minelli's stuff. Gene Kelly is the MAN! Van Johnson did a decent job playing against type and reminded me of his hoofer roots. And Cyd Charrise was her perenially lovely and swift-footed self. But I am just sort of lukewarm on this one. The songs were o.k. The choreogaphy was good, but the plot lacked something like maybe spontaniety and cleverness. The sets looked flat and uninspired. I didn't get involved in this one at all.<br />I often lament the death of the MGM musical, but here it seems like it really needed a expedidited funeral service.<br />This is one rare example where a great stage musical just didn't translate well as a movie. If you want to see MGM at its best, try SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, SEVEN BRIDES FOR SEVEN BROTHERS, or SHOWBOAT, but avoid this mess.
B000006054|5.0|Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; is a raging, sleepy, vibrant, dirty and phosporescent, as it captures the grime, the delight and the sway of American life. It is a gripping piece that thrusts the reader into the heat of the city, the purr of the suburbs and the spray of popular culture. It is one of the most remarkable products of the beat generation, possesing the all-encompasing sprawl of Walt Whitman and the raw reflection of Toni Morrison while creating its own unique voice. It is a dynamic, raw, and beautiful representation of America, stuffed with discord, sweetness and the the gorgeous raucus of American life. It is a poetic counterpart to Kerouac's nerrative as it bustles the reader on an increadible journey accross America, digging in crevices, moving through streets and sitting on kitchen counters.<BR>It sings in free verse the soul of America.
B00003CX9W|5.0|I originally saw this when it was re-released and I was in the first grade. It remains one of my treasured moments from childhood.<br />The classical compositions have been restored to brilliant clarity. The assault of color and the varying styles of animation are a feast for the eye. It is as mesmerizing today as it was when I first saw it.<br />Like many classics from a time long gone, it is a vivid reminder that there was a sweeter and more creative period in the 20th century when kids didn't have to tethered to computers and Nintendos to have quality downtime.<br />My kids and I went to see this in the theater a few years ago. Last year I bought this and the companion piece FANTASIA 2000. It was viewed on a big screen tv and was surprisingly effective inspite of the limitations of home theater.<br />I recommend this to anyone who wants to see Disney magic at its best. This is an excellent example of the varied talents of Disney's animation crew and a great chance to see Stokowski perform his own musical magic.
0872860175|5.0|Ginsberg's &quot;Howl&quot; is a raging, vibrant, dirty, sleepy and phosphorescent, as it captures the grime, the delight and the sway of American life. It is a gripping piece that thrusts the reader into the heat of the city, the purr of the suburbs and the spray of popular culture. It is one of the most remarkable products of the Beat generation, possesing the all-encompassing sprawl of Whitman and the raw cultural reflection of Morrison whil creating its own unique voice. It is a dynamic, raw, and beautiful representation of America, stuffed with discord, sweetness and the gorgeous raucous of Americn culture. It is a poetic counterpart to Keroac's narrative and a modern rendition of Whitman's &quot;Song of Myself&quot; as it bustles the reader on a fantastic journey accross America, diggin in crevices, moving through city streets and sitting on kitchen counters.<BR>It sings, in free verse, the soul of America.
B00005B36H|5.0|While it's certainly different, and not for everyone, it's no doubt the best Tool cd yet, featuring some insanely well crafted songs. The best songs on the album, in my opinion, would have to be Schism, Lateralus, Disposition, and Parabol/Parabola. <br />If your in any way interested in metal, then just give this cd a chance, because you may just fall in love with it like I did.
0060934913|5.0|Having worked in many restaurants at many different levels, this book does a great job of sharing the crazy behavior of the people who prepare food.. the pressure of a saturday night at a popular restaurant is something you must live to experience, but the author does a good job of portraying what it is all about -- and why people are drawn to this line of work.. a very funny and enjoyable read
0312265859|1.0|Who wrote this book?  Surely not the author who gave each character a heart and soul in the previous 7 books.  This is little more than an outline with characters tossed in, making statements obviously lifted from previous books.  Don't forget we know these people.  The biggest let-down was the encounter between Stephanie and Ranger.  It was shallow and not believable. Please don't judge the series by this book. But I must say that I will wait for reviews before buying the next Evanovich offering.
B00005QGAV|5.0|I love this album.  I recently bought it because I liked the songs I heard from it (Jam and Black or White, as well as others).<br />It is awesome.  I can't say it's my favorite because all the albums have their unique style and sound.  But this is Jackson stretching out while maintaining that contemporary edge.<br />Although the album is a tad long, it still is a great trip of dance, ballad, and groove.<br />Get the video while you're at it.  A nice companion piece to this album.
B000068IEU|3.0|Based on the reviews that I read here I was eagerly awaiting this dvd in the mail.  I was told that it was shocking as well as original, but I found none of those elements in the movie.  How can one be shocked by a movie that cuts from a rape/kidnap scene to the victim's parents making cake with god-awful happy synth music, 70's retro style?  That and there was the theme music for the killer Krug and company which described their evil plot of rape and torture with a \\"honky dory\\" sort of folk song.  How revolting.  The gore was quite minimal.  There was a short stab scene and one part that had extensive gore but that was the extent of the gore.  I mean the idea of being raped, and being forced to do awful things in order to save your friend from being cut is intense but the only horror generated in this film is all in the viewer's head.  I think it is a valuable look into Wes Craven's early career, but this movie is a poor example of his talent.  The documentary is interesting, but I can't imagine anyone vomiting in the theatre as a result of the content of this movie.  Basically, don't acquire this with hopes of be shocked, or entertained.

B00005RY7X|2.0|I wonder what was passing through the mind of Island's executives when they decided to saturate the market with one Andrew WK. \\"Look guys--- a dirty long haired painter-type with tourettes who plays disturbingly upbeat candy pop music and says the word party alot! The kids will eat it up!\\" Alas, poor Andrew has only been met with cruel stares, indifference and muffled whispers of \\"is that guy serious\\" followed by laughter. My reaction was akin to the latter upon seeing Party Hard on MTV. With such inspiring lyrics as \\"WE DO WHAT WE LIKE AND WE LIKE WHAT WE DO!\\" and a band (which contains Don Tardy... ex OBITUARY, yet another point of hilarity) pulled from fresh from the school for special children, was HOW DID THIS GUY GET A VIDEO ON MTV.<br />5 months later, after endless commercials, MTV specials and radio play, he has yet to sell gold and is basically a financial fiasco. <br />Musicwise, Mr. W.K. is overwhelming good vibrations, almost in stark contrast to the mad at your dad rock dominating airwaves. Imagine circus music with layers of electric guitars and a neanderthal on the microphone spouting frat boy catch phrases and gyrating wildly. That's just about it. I really don't see anybody actually putting this disc on, and thinking \\"wow this is really excellent music!\\". A novelty album at best soon to be gracing bargain bins nationwide<br />A true musical visionary
B0000029LG|5.0|We all know the fantastic geninus of MJ on CD 1 so let's move on to CD 2.<br />CD 2 is where the new meat of the set is. Although this is not MJ's best, it is interesting nevertheless due to the personal commentary in many of the CD's 15 songs.  <br />Everything from politics (Scream) to racism (They Don't Care About Us), to the ecology (Earth Song), to his personal struggles with the press (Tabaloid Junkie), to abuse (Little Suzie), the album ends with his personal statement about his whole experince in a cover of Smile.<br />Personal highlights for me include some of the above tracks mentioned: Scream, They Don't Really Care About Us, and Earth Song -- as well as the smooth Stranger In Moscow, a cover of The Beatles' Come Together, the ballad hit You Are Not Alone,  and the somewhat epic soundscape title track.<br />Bottom Line: Although it may not be Jackson's best, it is his most personal, aggressive, and intellectual album -- you get a peak into the thoughts of the one and only Michael Jackson through song.
0316096199|2.0|I read this book with the same veracity as most other reviewers but when I turned to the last page, I felt like I had been dropped out of a ten story building.  And now that I think about it, the dialogue and story had a 'blunted' feel to it.  Anyone can describe the brutality of a rape, but to communicate to women everywhere that to be strong and of good humor and maybe use a few drugs to numb the pain along the way is the method for mentally, emotionally and physically handle being raped is not being honest.  To be ravaged in that way...first by a rapist and secondly, by a painfully biased court system...and not write in depth about the years of many different types of therapy required to overcome the indignity, anger, self doubt and all the symptoms of PTSD is incomplete at best.  When I finished the book, I was really angry.  I was angry at the horror of rape, at the insensitivity of the criminal justice system and at the author for not addressing more seriously the unavoidable damage caused not only by the rape, but by an uncaring, dysfunctional family and support system.  I was even more surprised when at the end of the book, the author thanks her father, sister and mother for everything they did.  What???  While a precious daughter is going through a horrible trial for something entirely not her fault and then resorting to heroin, alcohol and anything else to numb the pain, her father sits outside the courtroom and her mother communicates with her via phone while her sister moans about her college major not quite being as satisfactory as it should be!?!<BR>Maybe Ms. Sebold could write another book about recovery.
0316666343|5.0|It took me two days to read through and tangle myself in The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold.  The trip of reading it was an emotional roller coaster ride that swung me from high to low with each turning page.   The story takes us through one girl's short life and long death.   <br />Our main character Suzie Salmon is brutally raped and murdered by a neighbor...but Suzie's character does not end with her murder.   She goes on to become our narrator in this fantastic read.   She unfolds our story with the happanings and emotions of her family after her death and how they must face life without her.   <br />Suzie's death takes us through a world that is blurred to the living.  In reading this novel you are taken on a journey of the dead and the living and the boundaries that are hardly ever crossed.  Suzie must somehow forget the idea of living and embrace her death.  In doing so she will gain her own peace and the peace of her family.<br />A powerful, emotional book that I adored reading!   An absolute keeper that I am sure I will take down and read again and again!
B000067CPX|2.0|I have tried to like this album. I heard the hype. Heard the title track and thought it sounded promising enough. I even read the Amazon reviews. And so I thought I was on safe ground.<br />But what I found was the most soulless assemblage of musical cliches. You have heard everything on this album a hundred times before -- a thousand times, if you include all the TV commercials for cars, airlines and telephone companies that use the same tired tricks. All of which have been borrowed from heavy metal and then softened for the mid-30s suburban demographic who are the target for this stuff. The husky, slightly raunchy voice -- so soulful. The clanging but melodic guitar. The lyrics that sound so deep but which are in fact deeply vacuous.<br />I am listening to it now, as I type -- and it is torture! I can listen to any three randomly chosen tracks before the boredom grabs me so hard that I have to stop it. It is as creative as painting by numbers. It is the worst sort of synthetic emotion. It will fit perfectly into your FM playlist, of course, right alongside Hootie and the Blowfish, Savage Garden, and similar dross. But if you are looking for wit and intelligence and music that moves you without resorting to cliches, spend your money on something else.
B000062X9B|5.0|The title sums it up.  This man is a genius and is one of the great American artists ever.  Buy this cd and everything else you can find by him.
B00006V9A0|1.0|Ok, lets get one thing clear before I begin: I am a massive Nirvana fan. Ok. Now we have established that we can start on this. The music is timeless. However, it is the principle of this album which has aggravated me enough to convey my emotions upon paper. When i saw the track listing I was surprised at see the glaring omissions from this album. There are to many to go into to. Of course i appreciate that the album couldn't contain all the greats. This of course, defeats the object of a \\"best of\\" nirvana. You want the best of Nirvana you buy all the albums. . Now i ask you do you really think, if Kurt Cobain was alive today, he would appreciate this? Would he want this? Now i am not the one to answer this, but perhaps they are merely rhetorical questions. Nirvana were one of the greatest bands to grace the earth. A thing they were not, was sell-outs.
B00006CXXU|5.0|geez, i was expecting the album to be much like Dirrty, but its not. It's really good, didn't expect that kind of an album from her. She can out-mariah mariah, and out-whitney whitney with her voice... if you guys are looking for an album you can listen to from end to end, this is certainly it.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this film, and I hate musicals. I usually find musicals to be very heavy handed, sappy, and pointless. But Moulin Rouge greatly contradicted my previous experiences. It was fast paced, beautiful, emotional, and above all, the music was great. Moulin Rouge had music from many genres, and time periods. This helped keep the `anti-musical' viewer, like myself, entertained. Music aside, the excellent acting in the film told a great story. I am usually not a big fan of Ewan McGregor, John Leguizamo, or even Nicole Kidman. But once again my earlier impressions misled me. They all did very well. In fact, there were no characters in Moulin Rouge that gave less than ideal performances. If you want a film that is truly creative, and exciting, then by all means, get Moulin Rouge.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Excellent movie to watch. Full of action and the right format of the first ever comic of Spidey. I can't wait for part 2 and 3 to be released. Amazing effects and camera angles used in this movie
B000002UAR|5.0|Many people have had heated discussions over the work of the Beatles.  What is truely the best? Is it 'Rubber Soul', the work that broke them away from the teen heartthrob phase? Could it be 'Sgt. Pepper', the first concept album ever? The ecclectic 'White Album', the end of an era with 'Abbey Road'?<br />Well, I can't say that I know exactly which album is the best. I love them all, but 'Revolver' is in my top three. This is the album that got me hooked on the Beatles. This is the album that showed everyone that these four guys were not a flash in the pan. Let me explain.<br />During the making of Revolver, the Beatles were introduced to acid. And while this is sort of a given for any band of the 60's and 70's- the Beatles used acid like a drug (ha ha). Without it, I believe that the Beatles wonuldn't have matured in the way that they did.<br />'Revolver' dabbles in almost everything. Not quite as much as the White Album, but you can still find a lot of variety. Let's take a peek shall we?<br />1)Taxman- George Harrison is utterly brilliant. He gave us such classic songs as Something and Here Comes the Sun, but I really think that Revolver is the point where he broke out of his shell. Taxman is a brilliant and sarcastic blow at the English taxing system. Pure rock n roll.<BR>2)Eleanor Rigby- This is my second favorite of every single Beatles song (check out Old Brown Shoe, will you?). Paul McCarntey shows lyrical genious is this moody and beautiful piece... \\"Wearing a face that she keeps in a jar by the door\\" always makes me breath a \\"wow\\".<BR>3)Love You To- One of my favorite George Harrison songs. After introducing the sitar on Beatles albums on Rubber Soul, he perfects it here, giving us a glimpse of his true talent, always shadowed behind John and Paul.<BR>4)I'm Only Sleeping- One of the weaker songs on Revolver. John provides us with a slow and sleepy song about staying in bed all day. This one usually makes me feel a bit heavy.<BR>5)Here, There, and Everywhere- This ballad with perfect close harmonies let's Paul weave lyrics constructed from the three words in the title.<BR>6)Yellow Submarine-Of course, who can forget the greatest children's sing a long of all time. Ringo gives us a chance to have FUN listening to music.<BR>7)She Said, She Said-Another slite disappointment from John. While this is a great song (I know what it's like to be dead) it is forgotten by the end of the album.<BR>8)Good Day Sunshine-A perfect slice of afternoon from Mr. McCartney. This is a song well worth listening to, though it does not show any true brilliance.<BR>9)Dr. Robert-The DRAG of the album. Sitting here, writing this review, having listened to this album a million times, I can barely remember the tune!<BR>10)For No One-A creepy, haunting ballad that always leaves me with goose bumps.<BR>11)And Your Bird Can Sing- Crank up the stereo on this one and enjoy the amazing guitar work and fun lyrics.<BR>12)I Want to Tell You-Listen to the piano on this Harrison composition. You won't be disappointed.<BR>13)Got to Get You Into My Life- One of my favorites! This song shows great growth because it resembles an early Beatles song but somehow shows maturity.<BR>14)Tomorrow never Knows- Lyrically, musically and spiritually wonderful. I cannot even put this song into words- you have to hear it.<br />Pop in Revolver and contemplate its ranking within the Beatles cataloug. A splendid time is guartanteed for all!
0739301985|5.0|I picked up this book for the holidays, expecting to see what Grisham could develop aside from law. This book had me laughing on every page. One of the best comedies I've read, and I'll read over in each coming christsmas year. Funny and an entertaining read
B000009O8A|1.0|I've gotta tell you people- you're really missing the point. I'm sure by now you've read a million other reviews telling you what this movie is about, but let's recap: Jennifer (Keaton), a New York City writer, goes to a Connecticut countryside retreat to finish her novel. So far, so good. While sunbathing on a boat, she is assaulted by a group of men and dragged onto shore, where she is repeatedly raped. After it's over, she (Jennifer) staggers through the woods back to her cabin, only to be attacked again by the same gang. [Now, these scenes are extremely graphic, but granted, they do work well with setting the mood of the story, and while slightly more graphic than they really had to be, I can understand the directors want to add these brutalizing scenes to the movie, to show the true nature and violence revolving around the act of rape. The rest of the movie is where it all goes [bad] .] They leave her for dead, but she survives and, (instead of going to the police, mind you) then proceeds to stalk and murder each one of her attackers.<br />See, this movie had some serious potential, with the harrowing rape scenes and some interesting premises. Someone pointed out the fact that after she is attacked, she begins to wear more concealing clothing. If the movie had just focused on Jennifer and her life after, being a survivor of such a brutal attack, then this had the potential to be a pretty powerful movie. But it didn't. Instead, this movie, like so many others, unfortunately went down the easier road, going for all out shock value rather than the real human emotions. Some could say the makers of this movie were trying to install some sense of power in Jennifer, and essentially all survivors of violence. Some could say they were making a statement on gender roles. Some could say it's a fantasy, a dream of revenge born out of real and true violence. The fact is that any way you look at it, they failed. This movie comes across as nothing but a big shock fest, exploitation to the max, and baby, it ain't the good kind.<br /> ...
B00005JKED|5.0|This is a must see movie!  If you haven't seen this movie, you have to rent it as soon as possible!  Denzel Washington does an amazing performance.  This outstanding movie will blow you away.  It's one of my favorite and also one of the best movies I have ever seen!

6300271285|4.0|This movie has everything most movies should have but don't.<br />Geeky heroes with a passion for zinnias, creepy sadistic dentists, enormous city-eating plants, a Greek chorus of do-wop girls and a busty blonde with a lisp and a Marylin delivery. <br />What more do you want in a comedy?<br />Starting out as an equally wonderful stage musical, this movie is worth watching just for the unforgettable performances of Steve Martin and Bill Murray ALONE. Martin, as the aforementioned sadistic dentist, has a short scene with cameo-appearing Murray who is a masochistic patient eager to strap on the gas mask. <br />But I get ahead of myself. <br />If the scene above sounds funny to you, the rest of the movie will leave you in stitches. The musical numbers remain largely intact, with the lamentable cut of &quot;Mushnik and Son&quot; (a mercenary duet between the money-hungry Mr. Mushnik and the family-hungry geek, Seymour), and the even more lamentable ommission of &quot;The Meek Shall Inherit&quot; which robbed Steve Martin of a chance to play in a few more roles!<br />Rick Moranis, who later played other lovable geeks in &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot; and &quot;My Blue Heaven&quot; (alongside Steve Martin again!), is a flawless and perfect Seymour. Nuff said.<br />Ellen Greene thankfully reprised her stage role as Audrey-- and she is possibly the only person to ever infuse Audrey with the perfect mix of innocence and ridiculousness. <br />Cameo roles are abundant, and all are perfect. Especially watch for John Candy, who has one of the funniest bits written specifically for the movie.<br />Disliked the ending a little bit-- but understood why they had to do it. 4 stars for almost being the best cult-movie-musical out there!!

B00003CXI1|4.0|This movie, was of course, the most anticipated of its kind. After the almost magical success of the Harry Potter books, it would be MORE surprising if a movie DIDN'T make a smash! JK Rowling, a fabulous author, deserves the successful recognition of a movie version-- it is only a shame that in these days, a movie is almost expected. I personally would have preferred to let the books remain legends in themselves. <br />This movie was quite wonderful, nonetheless. First of all, we had really wonderful British actors and actresses. From those we already knew would be brilliant (Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman), to the pleasant surprises (Daniel Radcliffe and especially Rupert Grint), the cast was awfully strong. The recreation of the atmosphere invoked by Rowling in her books is to be thoroughly applauded. The touches and nuances of color, texture and feel were absolutely perfect. The sound (especially the phenomenal musical score) deserves praise. Daniel Radcliffe delivered a rather sensitive portrayal of the newest brand of hero: The timid, &quot;who me?!&quot;, real-life, youthful chap who is raised to nobility despite himself and to much humble surprise. (Frodo in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Peter Parker in &quot;Spiderman&quot; are two other surprise-hero roles) <br />A couple gripes: Special effects looked like they were headed out to be flawless, until we got the icky video-gamey ogre and the dissapointing revelation of Lord Voldemort's face. Also: Emma Watson wasn't exactly ON. I hate critiquing actors because sometimes they are perfect in one role and just miss it in another, occasionally it isn't their fault. I just found Emma's Hermione more annoyingly one-demensional than Rowling's Hermione. She played up the confidence without tempering it with Hermione's slight insecurities. It's just a thought. <br />Also, despite all my praise, I realize that without the fabulous book series, this movie could never stand on it's own. This sounds obvious-- I mean, if the books hadn't been written, the movie wouldn't have been a concept, let alone a reality. But let me explain: This movie just doesn't mean as much unless you already loved the books. It isn't a great piece of film in itself. It is loyal to the text and faithful to Rowling's descriptions. Unfortunately, the best books-turned-movies were not exact replicas, but affectionate homages. The movies reflected the book without exactly copying it. <br />Of course, I am no director, and deeply admire anyone who can take such a literary success and even attempt to create a theatrical success as well. I realize that I am probably in the minority with my criticisms, and there is much to like about this movie. Worth seeing, but NOT instead of the books. My advice? Read the books instead. Hats off to all, especially Rowling.
B00005QFF1|5.0|Clean is the autumn wind,<br />Splendid is the autumn moon,<br />The blown leaves are heaped and scattered,<br />The ice-cold raven starts from its roost<br />Dreaming of you-when shall I see you again?<br />On this night sorrow fills my heart.<br /><br />-Li Po (701-762)<br />Chinese Poet, \\"Verses\\"<br /><br />In a mesmerizing story of love and loss based on Bao Shi's novel: \\"Rememberance,\\" you will find two hearts. A teacher wanting to give his knowledge to the next generation and a farm girl wanting to share her very soul with the man she loves. This is about how in the winter of a life, the summer is remembered and celebrated.<br /><br />From the very start of this movie, it will draw you into the intimacy of the most private thoughts of the characters. There are thoughts about life, death, love, loss and loneliness. The contrast of the black-and-white present with the ecstatic color flashback scenes of the past are so sharp, it is almost emotionally overwhelming. Snow drifts across the frozen earth and there are scenes of the bitter cold.<br /><br />The story is set around the life of a schoolhouse built when two people fall in love. As they age, the schoolhouse also ages and when businessman Luo Yusheng's (Sun Honglei) father dies, the schoolhouse is ready to be rebuilt. He leaves the city and returns to the snowy path leading to the mountain village of Sanhetun in Northern China.<br /><br />Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao) helped to build the schoolhouse and taught there for almost his entire life. After getting caught in a snow storm, his heart condition is revealed and he is unable to continue raising money for this project. He dies never seeing his dream of the new schoolhouse come true.<br /><br />Luo Yusheng finds his mother Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin plays the older Di) weeping at the school. She finally tells her son of her plans to carry her husband back in a coffin on foot. She doesn't want to use a car and so he must employ people from the surrounding villages. As her son takes care of the details, she weaves a funeral cloth for the casket. We are reminded later of why this means so much to her as we think of her innocent face peering through the red threads used to create the cloth hung in the schoolhouse.<br /><br />The story of the romance between 18-year-old Zhao Di (Zhang Ziyi from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon plays the young Di) and Luo Changyu is the focus of the movie. They are perhaps in love from the moment their eyes meet. In a world of arranged marriages, this freedom to love is unique. Di has her heart set on Luo from the minute she sees him. She pursues him like an shy animal hunting in the forest. She views him from afar and slowly works her way into his heart. Her pink coat floating between golden leaves as she runs, her anxious heart captured by her gaze.<br /><br />Each day as the school is built, she brings a dish for him and hopes that he will taste something she has cooked for him. Then as he teaches, she can't resist the sound of his voice. She has to be near him.<br /><br />When he has to leave to be questioned for political reasons, she has just made mushroom dumplings and so wants him to taste them. While the story is simple, the emotions are complex. You know what the characters are thinking even before they have spoken. You feel their hearts, imagine it is your breath seeping into the cold air like steam or your hands making the mushroom dumplings.<br /><br />Your heart runs with her to find Luo. And then you cry when the bowl breaks because you feel the intense longing Di feels. You live this story with her, you see love through her eyes, you know she would walk barefoot in the snow if she could just find Luo.<br /><br />As she waits for Luo to return, we know she is completely in love. She tells him she will wait for him and he promises to return on the 27th. When he fails to return, Di feels she has lost everything unless she goes to find the man she loves.<br /><br />You will want to cry because this movie is so incredibly beautiful. It is beautiful in its simplicity. Director Zhang Yimou has made one of the most beautiful movies you will ever see. The music by Bao San fills any space you would possible have to draw a breath and escape from being absolutely captured by every scene.<br /><br />I will gladly read subtitles for a movie this exquisite. This is perhaps the only perfect movie ever made. If you only saw one movie in your life, this should be it. I feel I can hardly describe this movie to you. There are hardly words to tell you how this movie absolutely enchanted me. 100 stars would not be enough.<br /><br />Like fresh water drawn from the depths of a well, this movie is all consuming in how it refreshes your spirit. It is a drink from the clearest mountain stream. It is pure in its deepest emotions of hope and longing and rich beyond material possessions in the beauty of love.<br /><br />This movie sets your senses on fire. You hear the crispest of sounds, the \\"splosh\\" of water as it is poured back into the well, fresh snow crunching underfoot and the sizzle of food in a wok set over a fire. Your vision is in complete bliss as an aesthetic awareness of nature swirls around you in pictures and sounds in a rural Chinese setting.<br /><br />Completely Charming in every way.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewde one of the most beautiful movies you will ever see.

B00006JKOL|4.0|Minstrel In The Gallery was one of the better Tull releases from this time period. With very good sound and content this remaster adds some bonus tracks(assuming from the same time period)but the booklet doesn't give that information unfortunately. The biggest gaffe here is the ridiculously short excuses for bonus live tracks. If you can't give me the entire song, don't bother, hence the 4 star rating. I hope that with future remasters, the booklets will be a tad more detailed about content and the snippet live tracks will be decided against. On the plus side: full lyrics, a forward by I.A., and the original gatefold sleeve from the lp version. Classic Tull indeed.
B000066NW0|3.0|Yeah, she's 17. Yeah, she wrote 75% of each song. Yeah, she wears clothes on stage and doesn't sing anything as vulgar and gratuitous as &quot;Slave 4 U&quot;. But she's also the most pretentious thing I've ever heard in my life. I have a hard time getting into any artist who celebrates themselves for being different.<br />I loathe Britney Spears, but at least there's honesty in her nasal, manufactured voice. She never pretends to be about anything so I never have to take the time to go along with it just to be disappointed.<br />Avril's first single &quot;Complicated&quot; has a great sound. I enjoy her quirky pronunciations and word choice, just like I did with Alanis Morissette. The song starts off with her saying, &quot;Uh huh. Life's like this.&quot; Oh, 17 year old girl from Canada, PLEASE tell me what life's like.<br />&quot;Sk8er Boi&quot; rings stupid every time it chimes. I know it seems oddly prudish but I don't like words being intentionally misspelled for the simple purpose of making whatever it's referring to look hip. The song itself is so silly and unreal, I skip it every time I listen to the album.<br />&quot;I'm With You&quot; was one I actually liked.. Maybe because the lyrics meant something to ME, which makes me a little prejudiced in deciding whether or not it's any good.<br />&quot;Losing Grip&quot; was excellent.. Except for some lines which were very poorly written. When introducing people to Avril, this is usually the first song I have them listen to but I have to grit my teeth and pretend to be deaf when she sings the line, &quot;Everything wasn't okay.&quot; I can't even express how simply STUPID that line is and it makes me embarrassed to like the song.<br />Avril Lavigne is a different kind of pop (pop - not punk) and I appreciate the change of scenery she's creating in the TRL masses (oh, every girl's gotta have a tie now). Her music is SLIGHTLY what I would call 'different'. But she's not all she cracks herself up to be and hearing her explain to me what 'life's like' is laughable. This isn't worth the money, there are few good songs on the album and even the good ones have parts that'll make you roll your eyes.me what 'life's like' is laughable.

B00006L3S3|4.0|Grossly underated album with some of Lennon's best work for years.<BR>Largely retreating from the politcal messages of &quot;New York City&quot;, this collection returns to the far more contented sound of &quot;Imagine&quot;. The use of laid-back instrumentation, pleasant melodies and highly crafted lyrics, gives the whole album a country-rock feel, the sort of thing you might have expected from Mike Nesmith or The Byrds at the time.<br />Like all Lennons albums from the mid '70's it has always suffered from appalling sound quality, probably a combination of Lennon's production technique and the use of tapes several generations from the masters. So improving on the sound quality was never going to be difficult.<BR>The original CD release from over 10 years ago is a  muddy and completely uninspiring presentation, sounding almost AM radio quality.<br />The immediate impression of this new version is that the sound is opened up and feels much warmer. You can actully identify many individual instruments for the first time, particularly the bass guitar, and the impression of a wall of sound has been completely eliminated.<br />Pity then, that the track Meat City has been spoiled by the use of an un-edited vocal take with a littering of ad-libs, exorcised from the original record. The track also fades to early, cutting short the spoken message at the end.<br />It's a pity that people familiar with the it do not get hear the material and highlight these sort of mistakes before it's release.<br />Bonus tracks are always going to be a matter of personal opinion. The three selected for this release whilst pleasant enough, add little to the presentation.
B00006LHYC|4.0|Italian chanteuse Laura Pausini has finally arrived. From The Inside is a solid collection of 12 tracks that deal with the many colors of love and all of its joys, pains and confusions. Her voice is clear as a bell, and very expressive as she sails through songs such as &quot;I Need Love&quot; or the subtle melancholy of &quot;Without You.&quot;  You have probably heard her first single &quot;Surrender&quot; on the radio (produced by Metro, the same team behind singles from Enrique and Cher). Let's hope that Atlantic Records can break this already proven artist into a superstar in the USA. (and avoid Sony's unexcusable failure in their attempt to introduce the brilliant Lara Fabian).  If you enjoy this album, check out Laura's Italian/Spanish cd's, as well as soundtrack songs &quot;One More Time&quot; from Message in a Bottle and &quot;Extra Mile&quot; from Pokemon 2000.
B00006NSGX|5.0|This latest release from rock legend Eric Clapton is a long overdo 2-cd &quot;live&quot; recording. Actually his last live recording was his &quot;Unplugged&quot; cd released in 1992. This 2-cd set was recorded during his 2001 tour and Clapton is in fine form here. Disc One starts with Clapton playing acoustic guitar on the first six songs. His acoustic guitar playing on songs such as &quot;Key To The Highway&quot; (a Derek &amp; The Dominos song) , &quot;Tears In Heaven&quot;, &quot;Bell Bottom Blues&quot; (another Derek &amp; The Dominos song) ,&quot;Change The World&quot;, etc. shows the diversity this talented guitarist has. He's as good on acoustic as he is playing electric guitar. It's not until &quot;My Father's Eyes&quot; that he switches to electric guitar. Every song sounds polished and Clapton's band is excellent with veteran keyboardist Billy Preston playing better than ever. Disc Two starts out with the bluesy &quot;I Want A Little Girl&quot;. And very few guitarists can play the blues like Clapton. The following song &quot;Badge&quot; (from his late 60's days with the rock supergroup Cream) sounds terrific with the addition of keyboards. And Clapton's voice sounds better than ever. Clapton's 70's hit &quot;Cocaine&quot; is full of energy and the backup singers also add a special touch to this version. My favorite Clapton song (from his Derek &amp; The Dominos days) &quot;Layla&quot; is outstanding with Clapton doing a nice guitar solo before the song kicks in. This version also includes the 4 min. extended piano ending which is played perfectly by Billy Preston. Another favorite (from his Cream days) &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; also starts with a nice guitar solo before going into the song. This is a nice updated version of the song again with the use of keyboards. Clapton's rendition of &quot;Over The Rainbow&quot; is a nice version which only he could pull off and make it sound good. This is an excellent &quot;live&quot; double cd that no Clapton fan should be without. Highly recommended!
1559408898|5.0|Before Paul Verhoeven directed the lambasted Showgirls and the dreadful Hollow Man, he helmed this sci-fi masterpiece that would become a box office hit and inspire inferior sequels, a dreadful TV show, two cartoons, video games, and a horde of comics.  Peter Weller plays Detroit cop Alex Murphy who is brutally (and graphically) gunned down in the line of duty.  Through technological enhancements, his brain is resurrected (with snippits of memories) in the form of a cyborg built by corporate company OCP (which owns the police force) to be \\"the future of law enforcemnt\\".  While RoboCop is an action sci-fi blast from beginning to end, but what lies beneath that is a satire of the news media and it's influence on the public in a city raging out of control (Verhoeven would later use a similar type of satirical style with 1997's Starship Troopers).  The casting is superb: Nancy Allen is perfect as Murphy's sympathetic partner, Ronny Cox is his usual slimy self as crooked OCP vice president Dick Jones, and Kurtwood Smith (Red on That '70's Show) is utterly fantastic as Clarence Boddicker, the S.O.B. you'll love to hate.  All in all, this is one of Verhoeven's finest directorial efforts, and is essential to any lover of action or sci-fi.  Get the Criterion Collection edition if you can, it's worth every penny.

B00005QG9J|5.0|When I first purchased `Morning View' it immediately became my travelling partner; wherever I drifted, Incubus were there to keep me occupied. Having already established the exquisite sounds of earlier renditions and material from their masterpiece `Make Yourself', I doubted that the album would satisfy my needs.<BR>In my normal state of consciousness I move in oblivion, ignorant to the hundreds of passer-bys, just purely concentrating on the music from my Walkman and on my destination. `Morning View' disturbed this outlook on life and caused panic in my veins due to the burning anxiety of what was happening.  It became apparent I was now extremely aware to the many different elements of what was happening around me.  Simple events like young ladies carrying their shopping bags and businessmen talking on their mobile phones.  My initial reaction was that the album blatantly had no interest or appeal and the only wise solution would be to save it for an early Christmas present for a mediocre friend.  <BR>The next day I decided to return to more appeasing sounds, unfortunately to my dismay `Morning View' had only opened my eyes and showed me the door.  I endured only apathy and loneliness for the entire day of my journey.  <BR>I returned to `Morning View' with a totally different perspective, this time managing to realise that songs such as `Wish you were here' and `Echo' brought ravishing atmosphere even into the dullest of situations. Whereas `Just a phase' and `Circles' only electrified morning traffic and made noise and pollution appear blissful.  It was clear that Incubus were simply consolidating their energy of music into every day movement. <BR>In synopsis: - `Morning View' creates a vigorous acuity and takes time to digest from beginning to end, but once you get to grips with all 13 sensational tracks - you'll never be lonely or homesick.
0394405641|5.0|When I first read the story about Anne Frank, I was in 8th grade where every english teacher in my school had chosen to read this story to all of there students. I had no idea of what the story was going to be about and also had no idea who Anne Frank was. But after reading about her life, I had saw how hard it must have been for her.<br />This year in school we had to choose a book to read and do a book report on it. I had chosen to do Anne Frank because I had already read a little about her but I had wanted to learn more information about her and life for Jewish people during WW2. By reading both of this book it had shown me how hard it was for Jewish people of all ages. They where taken out of there homes and sent to a concentration camp where most of them later died. It puts the whole world to shame because we all knew about this and nothing was getting done early. But finally we were able to help them and save them.<br />It takes a brave little girl like Anne to be able to write everything down in a diary that was happening in her life. And by Mr. Frank giving Anne's book to be published must had taken a lot of courage also. But in many ways we are glad that he did because Anne had showed us in many ways how tough it was to be Jewish and how hard it was to go into hiding. I would recommend this book for people off all ages because it is a wonderful book, and I know everyone will enjoy reading it.

B000002UAI|5.0|The fourth album by the Fabs is, yes, kind of subdued, but not by much.  There are upbeat numbers like \\"Rock And Roll Music,\\" the US #1 single \\"Eight Days A Week,\\" Ringo's cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't,\\" and the Little Richard medley to speed things up.  Gee, I've listed the bright spots of the album already!<br />However, songs like \\"I'm A Loser,\\" \\"Baby's In Black,\\" and \\"I Don't Want To Spoil The Party\\" reflect a kind of weariness creeping in that later evolved into the introspective Rubber Soul.  I mean, check out the sombre mugs on the album cover!<br />There aren't that many cover songs here than there were on their first two albums, but the ones they cover are beauts.  The best of these is Chuck Berry's \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" with that immortal chorus, \\"give me that rock and roll music/if you wanna dance with me.\\"<br />That being said, the Beatles have expressed that melancholy in upbeat songs such as \\"No Reply.\\"  That is about a girl who dates someone else and has her family covering for her.  The poignancy expressed with the \\"I nearly died\\" refrain.  And \\"I'm A Loser,\\" in the same uppity vein, has lyrics such as \\"Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown.\\" is it for her or for myself that I cry?\\"<br />The mid-paced \\"Baby's In Black\\" has shades of Dylan, hard to tell since all four of them are singing in contrast to Dylan's stark solo vocal.  Love that lyric:  \\"Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue.\\"<br />Paul sings a nice slow ditty \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\", which happened to be one of his earliest compositions dating back to the late 1950's.  In contrast, he wildly covers the engaging Little Richard medley, \\"Kansas City/Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey.\\"  Wonder how it sounds compared to the original.<br />Despite being Buddy Holly fans, \\"Words Of Love\\" is the only Holly song done, and it's lovingly done on this album, with Ringo's percussive instrument being a packing case of all things!<br />George's only song here is the Carl Perkins number \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby.\\"  Ironically, Ringo's song here is also a Carl Perkins number.  Both do their admirably best here.<br />For Sale is still a superior Beatles album despite the sobriety of many of the songs.aby.\\"  Ironically, Ringo's song here is also a Carl Perkins number.

B00006HBUA|4.0|The creators of the movie for Scooby Doo did a brilliant job of bringing Scooby Doo to life for the big screen. They did an even amazing job turning Scooby Doo into a computerized live action version to where Scooby is extremely realistic. As for the cast, I heard the rumors that everyone was basically disappointed. I wasn't I thought they picked the cast perfectly for the part. Sarah Michelle Gellar (Trying to forget about her Buffy character) did a great job playing the new aged Daphne, Matthew Lillard was the best part of the casting job as Shaggy!!! Linda Cardelini was beautifully transformed into the part of Velma, and as much as I love him Freddie Prince Jr. did an \\"okay\\" job of Fred. Not to mention one of my favorite actors and comedians Rowan Atkinson does a fabulous job in the film. Also for the Scrappy Doo lovers, you might be suprised, but definately not disappointed. The movie is upgraded to be in \\"the now.\\" And the background and sets are truly amazing and like a animated cartoon version for a live action movie. There is quite a bit of adult humor, but still makes if fun for young kids. I would think the film is great for ages 13 and up. But I think kids and adults will enjoy this movie from the cartoon and lovers of Scooby Doo. It does get silly in a bit parts and slow, so in that retrospect it might be dull to some. But the plot and the charaterizations performed by the cast did a brilliant job.<br />As for the DVD I would give that an A. I loved all the extra's on the DVD. From the never seen before footage, behind the scene's documentary, an interactive triva game, Commentary from the cast and filmakers and much much more. I also loved navigating the DVD with the 3D-ish style of a cartoon and with Scooby running back and forth. <br />All in All the movie would be about a C + - B +<BR>And the DVD Itself: A

B000000W5L|5.0|Raw, gritty, bluesy, country, great riffs, incoherent druggy, sex-loaded lyrics, rock n roll.  Exile represents the Stones at their peak and represents rock n roll at its best.  If you folks ever get a chance to see a good copy of the film \\"Ladies and Gentlemen:  the Rolling Stones\\" also from 1972, you will also see the Stones at their best live.  Getting back to Exile, while it is #2 on my list of Stones albums (Sticky Fingers being #1), it remains near the top of my all-time favorites, because like many other folks, Exile just never gets old.  Like others I agree that it does take a few listens to \\"get it\\".  Coming after Sticky Fingers, I had a hard time understanding what all that blues and weird songs were all about.  I wanted more rockers like Happy and All Down the Line.  And what was with the recording?  But over time, songs like Casino Boogie grew on me and in time, the whole album sounded great, murky and all.  And looking back, while I still love the classic Keith riff songs like Rocks Off and All Down the Line, my favorite song on this album is Lovin Cup.  What fabulous musicianship, especially from Charlie Watts.  Being from the 40 something generation, I'm glad to see younger folks getting into albums like this.  Exile came out around the same time as other classics like Zeppelin IV, Who's Next, Elton's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon.  Rock n roll was never as fresh as it was in this era.  Unbelieveable creativity.  It will live on forever.  Just like the Stones as they continue to blow new generations away on their Licks tour playing Happy and Tumblin Dice, among many other gems.
0064471837|5.0|My copy of the paperback doesn't aim this book at the young adult market explicitly (although the glowing reviews on the back from Philip Pullman and Lloyd Alexander could have given that away) and I must say that I didn't find it particularly young... I found it a dark and powerful book.<br />_Sabriel_ contains a startling original look at magic. The idea of a kind of necromancy controlled by bells is different from anything I've seen before and realized here in a unique way. Sabriel is caught in a world where nothing and noone is as they seem and where she has to fight alone to save her father. Definitely one of the new must-reads in fantasy.
B000000W5N|5.0|In my not so humble opinion, Sticky Fingers is the greatest rock n roll album of all time.  As a member of the 40 something generation, I was 10 years old when I first bought the single Brown Sugar at my local record store. Brown Sugar was a top ten hit at the time and it was a great song. I had maybe two or three albums at the time. I don't remember how I got the album Sticky Fingers, but somehow I got the album. From the very beginning, Sticky Fingers became glued to my turntable. Since 1971 I have now gone through two copies of the record and two copies of the CD. I cannot even fathom how many times I have listened to this record. It may equal the number of times I have listened to all other albums combined. <br />To me, the Rolling Stones are the greatest rock n roll band of all time. The Beatles may have been the most creative pop song writers and without question the most popular band. Led Zeppelin in their prime were also top notch. But the Rolling Stones ARE rock n roll and more than the Beatles and Zeppelin, they had a longer period of great creativity and they have endured the test of time as a band. From Keith Richards great riffs. To Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman's great rhythms. From great and unheralded supporting musicianship from the likes of Nicky Hopkins, Billy Preston and Bobby Keys. To Mick Jagger's unmatched charisma and energy as a front man live. The Stones are what rock n roll is all about. <br />Sticky Fingers, along with Exile, were the Stones in their absolute prime (I also think that Beggars Banquet and Let it Bleed are fabulous albums as well). Unlike some other great rock n roll bands, one thing that separates the Stones is how they can play all kinds of music as well as any other musicians, even those who specialize in those other sounds. On Sticky Fingers, if you want great riffs and hard rock, Brown Sugar, B(itch) and the first half of Can't You Hear Me Knockin are great hard rockin songs. If you want mellow ballads, Wild Horses, is agreat ballad. If you want country, Dead Flowers, is a darn good country song. If you want jazz, how about the second half of Can't You Hear Me Knockin. If you want great blues, I think I've Got the Blues is an awfully nice blues song (the other reviewers critical of I've Got the Blues have it dead wrong if you ask me). If you want great lead guitar, Mick Taylor's fabulous lead on Sway and Can't You Hear Me Knockin is as good as it gets. If you want some moody, different sounding music, have you ever heard songs like Sister Morphine or Moonlight Mile anywhere else? In other words, this album has it all. Great variety. Great mix of tempos. Great songs. Great rock n roll. Check that. The best rock n roll ever made. I never get tired of listening to this album even after four worn out copies of it. It's that good.
B00006NSGX|5.0|I saw this tour when in St. Paul MN.  The show was wonderful.  This CD brings it all back and then some.  Eric Clapton is an artist that must be heard live.  The musicians and arrangements are wonderful.  Clapton's voice has never been better.  Every track is a winner.  The 'legend' is in top form.
B000002KD5|5.0|Rumours got all the attention and was the huge album, but their previous album self-titled \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" was a superior album.  1977's Rumours is the album that put Fleetwood Mac on the map. Rumours was on the top of the best selling charts for months and is one of rock's greatest selling albums of all time. I love the album. It's a great and worthy album. <br />But I have always thought that Fleetwood Mac's 1975 self titled album \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" (also referred to as Fleetwood Mac's White album) was an even better album. While Rumours has sold well above 20 million copies, this earlier album hasn't done that badly either selling several million copies. This (what I'll refer to as) \\"FM\\" album was the first with this mix of fabulous musicians: Mick Fleetwood, John McVie, Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham and of course Stevie Nicks. From what I've read, the band had originally only sought to bring in Lindsey for his guitar playing prowess, but Lindsey insisted on allowing Stevie to join as well. Good decision, as Lindsey and Stevie both contributed to the magic that led the band into superstardom. <br />Both \\"FM\\" and Rumours have similar sounding styles. There are the rockin Lindsey tunes on both albums (Blue Letter, World Turning, I'm So Afraid on \\"FM\\", and The Chain, Go Your Own Way on Rumours). On the more rockin tunes, I'd actually give the edge to Rumours. Go Your Own Way was a huge hit and is obviously a Fleetwood Mac classic. The Chain also continues to get a good amount of airplay on classic rock radio and both have stood the test of time. <br />Both albums have plenty of catchy, mid tempo tunes that hit the pop charts, have great harmony, and are fabulous songs. On \\"FM\\" I'd put songs like Monday Morning, Over My Head, Say You Love Me and Rhiannon in this category. On Rumours I'd say Dreams, Don't Stop, You Make Lovin Fun and Gold Dust Woman fit this criteria. To be honest I'd give the two albums a draw when comparing these groups of songs. These songs areall great songs. Each album has an all-time classic that is heard frequently on classic rock radio playlists. (I'm referring to Rhiannon and Dreams.) Many of the other songs from both albums continue to get good play as well. <br />So far so close. Both albums match up pretty well on the harder rock tunes and on the mid tempo pop chart tunes. But it is on my final category that the first album exceeds Rumours by a long shot. And this category I'll describe as mellow or ballad songs. Rumours has only two really mellow, ballad-type songs on it. Dreams and Gold Dust Woman could marginally fit this category but really aren't what I consider \\"mellow\\" songs. Otherwise the only songs that I see fitting this category are the Christine McVie songs Songbird and Oh Daddy. I know that Songbird is a popular song when Fleetwood Mac plays live, but I really don't consider either of these ballad songs that strong. On the contrary the \\"FM\\" album has three songs I feel are some of Fleetwood Mac's greatest all-time mellow, ballad songs. Christine McVie's Warm Ways is a beautiful song that has a very smooth, romantic feel to it. Crystal is a Stevie Nicks song sung by Lindsey Buckingham that they had previously recorded on their previous album prior to joining Fleetwood Mac. Crystal is a beautiful song with typically vague but enthralling Stevie Nicks lyrics. Finally there is Landslide. Another wonderful, mellow song that never got a lot of airplay when it was first released, but has been played more and more over time because its greatness has been increasingly recognized. Great combination of Stevie Nicks lyrics and vocals and Lindsey's acoustic guitar. <br />Looking at both albums as a whole I feel that there are nine really strong songs on the earlier \\"FM\\" album and seven really strong songs on Rumours. This subjective judgment, along with what I feel are timeless mellow, ballad songs on the earlier album make me give the edge to \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" over Rumours in terms of greatness. Ithink that folks who only buy Rumours to hear Fleetwood Mac are really missing out on an even better album. I will qualify this assessment by saying that Fleetwood Mac made a huge mistake when they left out Stevie Nick's classic B side song Silver Springs from the Rumours album. I think Silver Springs is one of Fleetwood Mac's greatest songs of all time. From what I've read, internal battles and politics led to its failure to land on the Rumours album. Fortunately it has gotten some recognition and radio play from its inclusion on the Dance album. Great song, that if included, might have pushed Rumours up to the greatness of the earlier \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" album.
B00006G8LB|5.0|Years ago, Spider-Man (and his other Marvel compatriots) were some of my favorite Saturday AM cartoons. So I was thrilled to see such Spider-Man come to life on the big screen.  I saw this movie several times at  the theater, where it  was most impressive, during that 1st record-breaking weekend.  (Honestly, I rarely go to 1st run movies until they have a track record of decent reviews, but THIS was an exception!)  I, like many others,  am now a small part of  cinematic history.<br />      I bought the DVD on Nov 1st, the  first day it was released, then  I  spent the entire weekend watching Spider-Man over and over in it's various languages and with its special features.<br />      The Weaving the Web pop-up production notes are persistent, informative, and often witty.  The blue notes are historical and production related, whereas, the white pop-ups compare the comic book Spider-Man to the movie version.  The Spidey Sense web-i-sodes were sparsely populated but cool interviews of the man behind the live spiders, Randy \\"Bone-saw\\" Savage, and the various set-masters.  A few more of those specialist interviews were in order here. <BR> <BR>      I'm sorry to say I could not bear sitting through even a few chapters of the movie as annotated by John Dykstra and the special effects crew...Dialog may not be their forte.  On the other hand, watching the whole movie again with Sam Raimi, Laura Ziskin, Grant Curtis, and Kirsten Dunst was a real hoot-- funny, personal, and spontaneous.  It felt informally intimate, as if they were all having a great time watching the movie together in my own living room.<br />       Music videos, trailers and TV commercials for the movie are all self-explanatory. DVD-ROM features on both discs, of course, require a blessing from Bill Gates.  Gamers will like the Activision Hints & Tips.<br />       There are *2* making-of programs on disc 2 (HBO and E!'s Spider-Mania),  separate interviews with Danny Elfman and Sam Raimi,  and, yes, the Gag/Outtake reel is side-splitting hysterical.  Comic book fans will enjoy the Spider-Man Comic Archives with book covers that traverse 4 decades  of Spider-history, as well as the interviews with the artists who made Spider-Man possible.  The account of the Spider-Man comic book issue dealing with 9/11  brought me to tears.  (Actually, I would have liked to have seen those deleted scenes of Spider-Man *with* the Twin Towers in this section-- as a tribute to the courage of the comic book writers/artists involved with that issue number.)<br />      Speaking of comic book-- purists, that is:   Even Superman was updated (remember the public telephone?).  What do we now know about radioactivity in this post cold-war era? It causes harmful genetic mutations, aka birth defects,  so if the comic book spider had been real, those mutations would likely have killed it.  I find the genetically-engineered spider a much more credible device, just as the organic web-shooters make much more sense since genetic changes cause Spidey's powers.  Just be glad they made the webs shoot from his wrists, whereas  a real spider's spinerret is  located on its posterior. (There is such a thing as being \\"too\\" authentic!)<br />       A note about the screen tests:  Remember when Tobey Maguire was being considered for the lead,  everyone KNEW he could do Peter Parker,  but many DOUBTED  he could BE Spider-Man.  He insisted on doing a  screen test to prove his physical ability.  A \\"reading\\" would  not have accomplished this, so his screen test was quite \\"produced\\".   Other \\"screen tests\\" were unorthodox  and done in foreign countries, so possibly may not have been available or print-worthy.   A friend of Willem Dafoe video-taped him in a Spanish hotel lobby as he \\"performed\\" the Green Goblin.  And a whole entourage went to Berlin (including Tobey who had strep throat) to have Kirsten Dunst \\"screen test\\" with Tobey to test their \\"chemistry\\".   Do you really want to see T.M. in ill health? I doubt it.And don't be surprised if Dafoe's tapes end up on E-Bay!<br />        CGI effects aside (some could have been worse, some could have been better), this is one SUPER DVD SET of one SUPER MOVIE.  So BUY IT,  SPIN IT,  SIT BACK and ENJOY!

1891252089|5.0|Beautiful book!  But, not for beginners.  I am returning this book since it does not fit my needs as a beginner.  I am ordering &quot;Yoga Over 50,&quot; which appears to be a better choice at this stage of my development.  Ashtanga Yoga is a book that I hope to grow into, within a few years.
B000002H97|4.0|This album has taken a lot of flak and also some praise as being the last good Metallica album.  This album features something never heard before on a Metallica record, namely production.  It actually sounds like they did more than one take on the songs, in fact the whole album sounds like there was a lot of hard work put into it.  The album has moments of greatness, but some lows as well.  The album does not hide the fact that it is not And Justice for All or Master of Puppets.  It'd bold and innovative, given that in 1991 there was nothing like it on the radio.  Since then there's been hundreds of acts trying to ride the coat tails, but this record stands out as the original.  Definately worth a buy, but there are better Metallica records out there.
B000002G7E|1.0|I have to admit that when I first heard this album as a high-school student, I was captivated by how horrible it was. My friends and I would listen to it repeatedly, almost to the point of cult-worship. We then sought out other Velvet Underground albums, hoping for a similar &quot;so bad it's good&quot; experience - but alas, none of the band's other releases, bereft of musicianship or good lyrics though they were, could compare with &quot;White Light White Heat.&quot; Everything just came together magnificently on this one - the writing, the playing, the singing, the engineering, even the famous &quot;skull cover&quot;... It all adds up to a classic!<br />I don't want to spoil the music by analyzing it too much, but let me point out Sterling Morrison's lead guitar on &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; as a &quot;highlight&quot; of this special collection.
0553103547|5.0|Alright, I'll cut to the chase...this is an outstanding book.  I'm not an avid reader, mostly because I have a hard time paying attention to a lot of books when I could much more easily be watching a movie or working on the computer.<br />But not here.  A Game of Thrones is one of the most gripping books I have ever read with a complex, though easily followed, plot and superb character development.  I found myself not being able to put the book down because I had to know what was going to happen to the Starks, Lannisters, and other families in the book.  And when things went bad for some of them, it actually affected me, so well drawn out are the characters.<br />If you are someone who like to read at all, and especially if you like fantasy, there is no way you can go wrong with this one.  It's not sorcery and dragons, altough there is a little of that.  But it is political intrigue, knightly valor and honor, terror, and romance.  And above all, it is an accessible, complex, thoroughly enjoyable read.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKNC|4.0|This is not a movie I will strongly reccomend you to watch. But if you are a Jim Carrey fan, you may love this movie, but the movie runs about 2 and a half hours. And I feel that this is one of the movies, books, music, etc that doesn't dervse 5 stars but 4 stars. But if you like to watch movies about 2 hours and 30 mintues, I also reccomend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. As the movie opens, Peter Appleton (Jim Carrey) is a movie writer. Until he gets into a car crash, and doesn't remember anything when he wakes up. He goes to a town, and is mistaken for Luke Trimble, who has been missing for a long time. Of course if mistaken is the right word. Matt Damon (in an uncredited role) voices Luke Trimble only once in this movie. There are two things I feel that are important to know before you wach a movie (for the first time). One is to know how long the movie runs. And two, know what the movie is rated. This movie got a PG rating. So I will leave it up to you if you want to let your kids/teenagers watching this. Like I said earlier I give this movie a lukewarm recomention.
B00006YXE4|5.0|In this album, the listener will rarely be treated to a signature guitar solo. Prepare for mildly dissapointing version of Layla and lots of time spent on mellow song. Eric Clapton hasn't lost anything, but he has definitely begun mellowing out in his aging years. Beware this album if you only want long, hot, emotional guitar solos.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I randomly picked this CD up one day, not really knowing what it was. In all honesty, the band's name is what compelled me to buy it. I thought the name was pretty out there, something I'd name a band. From the moment I put this CD into my car's CD-Player I could not stop driving. I drove for an hour just listening to the CD, in complete and utter awe. 30 Seconds to Mars had just shattered my perception of music. I had never heard anything like them before. As I listened to the CD more and more, I grew to love the band more and more.<br />Then one day, while flipping through the booklet, I found out that Jared Leto was the lead singer. This blew me away. Not the fact that he could sing, but the fact that he kept such a low profile. Most celebrities who form bands use their status to push the CD, but not Jared. Infact, in all the pictures I've seen he's tried to hide his face. I totally respect that. He doesn't need his celebrity status to woo people into buying this CD. This CD is amazing enough. Jared Leto, and the rest of 30 Seconds to Mars are all about the music, and it shows.
B00005K3NR|5.0|A masterpiece.  Period.  End of review.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|The movie &quot;A Beatiful Mind&quot; is reali great. We could see that genius John F,&gt; Nash was godd with mathematics and physics, and cuold get a good job as professor at the Massachusetts College and also married one of his studen ts. But for reazon he saw 3 different unreal people thet tried to help him, but they didin't really . This situation brought to his life and his wife too. So he lost almost everything; than he had epecial medical attention for several years. Nevertheless, through time he worked with himself to again be was in the past.<BR>     I really enjoyed this movie. One of the things that I like was the happy end. Even though the genius John Nash had trouble , he improved himself with hard work, and maybe he couldn't be the same person, but he didi his best and was awarded with the Novel Prize in 1994. It was wonderful. Also his wife loved him so much and she supported him to the end.<BR>      In short, I suggest that you have the opportunity to watch this movie because it teaches us how we can improve ourselves trough sacrifice even trought If we fallen.

B00006G8HX|5.0|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is constantly overshadowed by the unbridled success of its immediate predecessor Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  While Star Trek II: TWOK clearly gave the franchise the adrenaline shot it so desperately needed after the soporific Star Trek: The Motion Sickness, Star Trek III: TSFS stabilized and cemented the series for additional sequels and several spinoff series.  Leonard Nimoy knew all too well that a successful Star Trek film requires more than an interesting story, it must capitalize on the well-established chemistry between the characters.  Following that premise, a wonderful tale emerges with allegorical connections to the Cold War.<br />I will not summarize the plot since most fans will know it by heart, and for those of you who have not seen this film, I do not want to spoil it for you.  What should definitely be noted are the many unspoken contributions this film makes to the future of Star Trek.  We are introduced to two new classes of starships in the Federation fleet that will reappear with great frequency in the coming sequels and spinoff series: the USS Excelsior and the USS Grissom.  The Klingon Bird of Prey which made its debut appearance in this film continues to be seen well into the 24 century.  And we cannot forget the infamous Spacedock.  Another seldom mentioned aspect of the film is the return of humor to the franchise.  This sequel sports some of the funniest lines spoken in the Star Trek franchise: \\"up your shaft\\", \\"if my mother had wheels she'd be a wagon\\", \\"don't call me 'tiny'\\".  This trend would perpetuate itself in the following sequels.<br />As for the technical aspects of the DVD.  We do not get any deleted scenes/alternate endings.  Echoing the words of Nicholas Meyer in relation to Star Trek II: TWOK: \\"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\\".  Same goes for this movie.  It works, it works just fine.  We do get to see the original trailer, which is a funny flashback in time when compared to the ones oftoday, such as the Star Trek: Nemesis trailer tagged on to this DVD set.  We also get to hear from NASA scientists how terraforming is growing into a reality, maybe not \\"Genesis\\" but something akin to it.  The best is to hear the interviews with Leonard Nimoy, William Shatner, Harve Bennett, Christopher Lloyd, and Robin Curtis regarding the making of this film.  Shatner tries a little \\"tongue in cheek\\" humor, while Nimoy expounds upon his first time in the director's chair.<br />For fans, the movie is a \\"must have\\".  For non-fans, rent it first, then make it a \\"must have\\".  And happily, we should soon have the Special Edition of Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, an all time favorite, which completes the Genesis Planet/Spock story arc.  What I am almost afraid to see is the Director's Cut or Special Edition of Star Trek V: The Final Frontier...this one is \\"broke\\" and is in dire need of being \\"fixed\\".
B00006CXSS|5.0|This mini series is one of the best in its class. The true hardships the men of the 101st, E company had to go throught to protect this county is brought out very well. The extras bring more to light about the men who fought and died for this county in that great era.
B000002LKF|5.0|I got this CD when it first came out, and it has really never left my consistent play list.  No album has ever done that for me.  About 5 or 6 six years ago, I started referring to this album as the very best album - any artist, any genre - that I have ever heard.  My absolute favorite album of all time.<BR> <BR>For one, this is a collection of great songs, every one.  The music and words fit perfectly together.  With creative melodies and rich harmonies, the brilliance of the lyrics seem to flow effortlessly out of the music - not too pushy, but also not too subtle.  Plus, this is his best purely lyrical work throughout the course of any entire album, in my opinion - laced with subtle double meanings and multidimensional images.  The lyrics here are at once deeply personal and universal - potent and touching - intelligent and sensual.  This is the best lyrical effort from perhaps the finest lyricist in modern music.<br />Also, the musicianship is flawless, intricate and beautiful throughout the album.  The different guitar parts intertwine with bass playing that is mind-blowing.  And the DRUMS!!!  It's all overpowering and subtle at the same time  melodic and rhythmic.<br />Finally, this album stands out as more than just a great collection of songs - it also stands as a coherent album.  This is the main way I see this album rising above even the Graceland effort (which is obviously brilliant in its own right).  Each song seems to flow from the previous song into the next (lyrics, music and tone) - each song sounds like a part of this album, while remaining so different from the others.  The whole album evokes a mood that is indescribable and unmistakable at the same time.  Even the mixing and production of the album are top notch (Listen to this disk on quality headphones).  There are very subtle delay effects on the voice and guitars that add color, and while there are many different things going on musically at any given time, it never gets overwhelming.  Ive never heard a warmer sounding album.<br />This album is brilliant through and through - it belongs on a shelf of its own, mounted somewhere above your top shelf of CDs.
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is a work of genius. Michael Romeo is a guitar god, and is one of the best overall guitarists around in my opinion. The song selection here is great, from songs like the shred-heavy &quot;Inferno(Unleash The Fire), the beautiful &quot;Accolade II&quot;, and the wonderfully epic title track &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. For me, this album ranks up there with their masterpiece, &quot;The Divine Wings of Tragedy&quot;. If you are a fan of Symphony X or a fan of heavy, technical and beautiful musicianship in general, you owe it to yourself to pick up &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. It is completly deserving of the perfect 5 out of 5 star rating. Best release of the year, thus far!
078322947X|1.0|DVD COMMENT BY GANGARUNNER: One of the most intensely realistic thrillers ever made and William Friedkin's greastest work. Also the greatest REMAKE ever made. But is it formatted in WIDESCREEN with extras and maybe COMMENTARY? Heck no, it's FULLSCREEN with no extras. This movie would get 5 STARS but I give 1 STAR to the STUDIO for releasing this MASTERPIECE in FULLSCREEN. If ever a film begged to be LETTERBOXED, it's this one. I know this film did not do well in it's initial release, but it's obviously a CULT CLASSIC, now. I guess Friedkin is too busy doing another EXORCIST REISSUE- THE VERSION YOU HAVEN\\"T PAID FOR YET. What a crime.<br />Maybe Criterion will redo this the way it should have been done. Don't fail to check out their version of the original classic, THE WAGES OF FEAR. A WORD OF WARNING-it's in French.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|For some, the novelty of AMERICAN RECORDINGS has worn a bit thin. In light of Cash's recent health problems and fragile appearence, some might say things have gotten downright ghoulish. The \\"resting-in-peace\\" pose of the cover doesn't help matters.<br /><br />If AMERICAN RECORDINGS was a milestone, rumor would have you believe that this is the tombstone. Not so. The opening cut is a powerful peice of work. Up there among the best of Cash's originals. What begins as a madman rambling Revelations into a cheap reel to reel breaks into a catchy rant. Equal parts  Gospel and Rock & Roll, Faith & Doubt duke it out amid a storm of Biblically surreal imagry. Haunting lines like, \\" A thorn tree in a whirlwind\\" capture the mood of spiritual frustration perfectly.<br /><br />Half the fun of the AMERICAN series seemes to be, what fashionably hip or offbeat cover is he going to tackle this time. Nirvana? Belle & Sebastian? The Doors? Nope, Nine Inch Nails. \\"Hurt\\" is unbelievable. Sad, unadorned & bruised. It's Cash's song now & one of the best things on here. A classic.<br /><br />Browsing through the rest of the track listings, I was a bit disappointed. The Beatles, Paul Simon, Sting---The Eagles! Simon & The Beatles have been covered to death through the years & who really needs another version of \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\"?<br /><br />Well, \\"In My Life\\" brought tears to my eyes. As an interpreter of other's work, he's in fine form. Cash's reflective, shakey baritone lends the song a deeper meaning. In terms of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", I've never heard a version that's topped the original. But Cash's world weary delivery adds something new, despite the intrusion of Fiona Apple's nebulous groaning.<br /><br />Another surprise is \\"I Hung My Head\\". Though never a Sting fan,  this is one of my favorite cuts on the album. A remorseful murder ballad is the classic sense, in Cash's hands it's deeply affecting.<br /><br />His versions of \\"Danny Boy\\" and \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\" are equally arresting. Time might just prove them to be definitive. Perhaps the only misstep might be, \\"Personal Jesus\\". Though Depeche Mode's hit seems tailor made lyrically, the whole thing comes off a bit forced & awkward.<br /><br />Now some might say his duet with Nick Cave on \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\" is a bit redundant. It's certainly the most gleefully wallowing version I've ever heard. But those gruff baritones compliment eachother well. They sound like a couple of old drunks in a boxcar bound for nowhere. Imagine if they managed to get Tom Waits on board as well.<br /><br />Fans of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" might recognize the closing track. I think \\"We'll Meet Again\\" marks the first time a clarinet has appeared on a Johnny Cash album. All in all, it's an unexpected conclusion to an unexpectedly great album. Despite any flaws,THE MAN COMES AROUND outshines his two previous efforts. One of the best records I've heard all year.might just prove them to be definitive.

B00006CXXU|4.0|Just before detractors judge Ms. Aguilera's album as a pretentious flesh-fest from its notorious cover, the contents inside bares her talent and much-appreciated effort to distinguish herself as a creative vocalist and producer from the conventional pop orbit. Associating herself with a talented ensemble of songwriters no less, Ms. Aguilera's album sheds away her teensy-pop image as she confronts her adolescence as a matured woman. \\"Can't hold us down\\" a pop collaboration with Lil' Kim aims to drive misogynist up the wall with Ms. Aguilera's staunch defending of woman's rights; \\"Fighter\\" puts her strong vocals into a testament to survive after betrayal. While most of the songs are penned by Matt Morris, Scott Storch and Ms. Aguilera herself, it is gems like Alicia Key's evocative contribution \\"Impossible\\" that stretches her versatility in manoeuvring blues and heartfelt emotions and Glen Ballard's rousing ballad \\"The voice within\\" that sees her soaring without histronics. <br />Yet Ms. Aguilera is most comfortable with Linda Perry who most notably became Pink's contributor recently and is best at unraveling the angst of troubled teens. Her second single off the album \\"Beautiful\\" sees her introspective and teetering on the edge of vulnerability, determined to vindicate herself. \\"I'm Ok\\" paints a grim portrayal of an abused girl coping with fear and shadows while \\"Make Over\\" is defiantly stating her confidence in her new image. There are accidental spot-on inference too - as Ms. Aguilera boldly declares, \\"Sorry I'm not a virgin\\" in Stripped Pt. 2, she gives much to lampoon over her pop-rival and her definition of \\"edgy\\". <br />So it is with bitter irony that while she tries to explain her naked self, the artistic interpretation of Ms. Aguilera be seen by many as using sex appeal to sell her album. They say picture tells a thousand words but if you ask me her most resilient and malleable side is better found in her voice, self-composed songs and her courage to breakthrough as an artiste.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This album is one of the best ever! Christina Aguielra grows to become more than just a pop star and becomes a true artist. Most songs were written by her, and this album was executively produced by her as well. All the songs are a reflection of her life and her view of the world. Buy this album and you will not be dissapointed. This has got to be one of the best this year! <br />Track Review:<BR>1. Stripped Pt. 1 - a great interlude featuring clips of Fred Durst, Eminem, and MTV, among others (8.8/10)<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down (feat.

0380977788|3.0|I never imagined I would give anything written by Neil Gaiman less than a five star rating, but I'm only giving _Coraline_ three stars because I feel so guilty that I didn't like it more than I did.  For something by a writer of such abilities, it struck me as particularly bland and lifeless, and did not live up to some of the raves I have heard, claiming that it is sure to replace _Alice in Wonderland_ as a new children's classic.<br />Coraline, a girl of about nine or ten (not specified, but that was the sense I got) lives with her parents in an old house that has been converted into flats.  Her parents are benignly neglectful and the other flats are populated by characters who are benignly eccentric.  During the course of exploring the house, Coraline discovers a mysterious passage between her flat and another, which sometimes is bricked up and sometimes gives access to an alternate and moderately darker version of reality.  There she meets a personage claiming to be her \\"other mother.\\"  This being tempts her to stay in the alternate reality forever and promises that she will never be bored and will have everything she wants.<br />The first thing that struck me about _Coraline_ was its stunning lack of originality.  From Alice to Narnia, how many books have we read where kids at loose ends discover alternate realities in old houses?  _Coraline_ did not really offer anything new on the subject.<br />The second thing that struck me was the banality of the characterization.  No one in this book stirred me to sympathy, or any emotion at all.  The evil character wasn't scary, merely boring.  The only interesting person was the cat, and there I was hampered by its similarity to the Cheshire Cat of Alice fame.<br />The writing had its moments.  I did recognise certain lines and phrases that appear verbatim in other of Gaiman's works, as if they had been recycled to add a little spice.  The story just didn't do a thing for me;  it seemed obvious and somewhat trite.  Although the alternate reality was supposed to frighten, or at least impress you with its darkness, it just left me with a big, \\"So What?\\"  I've had scarier neighbours and been scarier places in this reality!<br />For a writer of Gaiman's abilities, this seemed very off the cuff -- the sort of thing one might produce off the top of one's head as a bedtime story.  I missed the detail and the deeper exploration he most often gives his subjects, which I think would not be inappropriate to a childrens' book.  In the end, _Coraline_ came off as superficial.<br />Dave McKean's drawings were interesting, but the black and white pencils did not have the impact of some of his other work.  They also did not add much to the story.<br />_Coraline_ might make a good read-aloud book, where the reader could imbue the characters with personality and the situations with feeling.  It is an extremely easy read, and as such might be good for beginners.<br />\\"Alice,\\" however, it certainly is not.ough the alternate reality was supposed to frighten, or at least impress you with its darkness, it just left me with a big, \\"So What?\\"  I've had scarier neighbours and been scarier places in this reality!<br />For a writer of Gaiman's abilities, this seemed very off the cuff -- the sort of thing one might produce off the top of one's head as a bedtime story.

B000001Y42|5.0|Three Dollar Bill is the only cd where Fred Durst actually writes some decent rhymes, whereas on Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish he just throws out meaningless sentences and insults. It's also the only one where there is some real feeling behind the songs, not like now where Durst tries to act all depressed and fails miserably. In fact when Significant Other came out that was when I really began to despise Durst, though I never really cared for the dude to begin with. Don't get me wrong though, I enjoy LB's music but they need to get a new frontman. Every song on this cd though is entertaining not to mention rockin' in every sense of the word. To be honest this is by far their heaviest cd, and even though Durst drowns out his screams (what a dork) he does scream for a moderately long time sometimes. My favorite songs are \\"Pollution,\\" \\"Counterfeit,\\" \\"Stuck,\\" \\"Nobody Loves Me,\\" and \\"Leech.\\" A lot of you are probably asking, \\"Why isn't 'Faith' in your list?\\" Well, there's a simple reason for that, because it was majorly overplayed. The song is decent but I've heard it so many times I'm just burned out by it. I highly recommend that if you want to buy a LB cd this one should be the ONLY one you buy. Significant Other is their worst cd, and Chocolate Starfish is almost as heavy as this one but it has the worst lyrics. Don't even bother with New Old Songs because that's just a throwaway remix album. If Fred Durst wouldn't have become such a greedy SOB like he is now LB would sound just as good as they do on this album.
0440219078|4.0|Have you ever wanted to live in a perfect world?  In The Giver, Jonas lives in the perfect world that does not have war, sickness, or hunger.  Lois Lowry wrote The Giver in 1993.  This Newbery award book is a futuristic science fiction about what could possibly happen in post-apocalyptic times.  The theme of The Giver is life is boring and meaningless if everything is the same.  Although some things are hard and painful, those times make life interesting and worth living.<BR> Jonas is an ordinary boy in his community, except for one fact: he sees beyond.  At the age of twelve, all children go to a ceremony and receive their life job.  Jonas was given the job of Receiver of Memory.  He receives all the memories of the past from the Giver.  When Jonas grows old, he will be the Giver and give his memories to the new Receiver of Memory.  The memories are from hundreds of generations ago.  Some memories are happy, while some are horrifying and very painful.  The Receiver keeps the memories so the people do not have to endure them.  Therefore, people give up color, individual freedom, and responsibility.  While Jonas is receiving memories, he realizes life was better when everything was not the same.  Although there was violence, hunger, and sickness, life was more meaningful.  Jonas and the Giver want to do something, to somehow bring more meaning to the community, but are not sure what to do.<BR> The Giver is a very interesting, yet different kind of book.  It makes you think about what the world and the human race could become.  It also makes you think about the importance of freedom and of diversity.  I thought it was a good book; though some <br />people might find it disturbing.  For example, Jonas finds out what releasing really is.  He only knows it is the worst punishment in his community, but does not realize that it is a type of euthanasia or mercy killing.  As a writer, Lowry uses very vivid and colorful verbs and adjectives. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not mind disturbing references and likes thinking of the future in a different way.
B00005QIPH|1.0|With all the hype that was surrounding the strokes, and all the excellent reviews they recieved, I really wanted to like this album.  It got my hopes up really high, but let me down in big way.  I'm not saying that other people won't like it, I just could not stand listening to Julian's voice for more then one song.  Although the guitar playing is good, I can't recommend this album.  I would suggest downloading some of the songs that aren't singles, because if you want a whole album of &quot;Someday&quot;, your not going to get it.  In my opinion, the Strokes are seriously overrated.  But that's just me talkin.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This is the greatest CD! I love Kurt Cobaine and his band's music really did change the world. I love how eclectic the CD is putting just the right balance and mixture of all their CDs in one not to mention the unreleased \\"You Know Your Right.\\" I can't give but the best to this band whos name will live on forever!
B00006LLLN|5.0|Alison Krauss and Union Station never ceases to amaze me with their warm harmonies and genuine instrument playing. What you hear on their albums is what you get in their live shows and their first live album is no exception. In this collection, they do play their most popular songs. You hear the raw talent in this release-two CD's worth, making me feel as though I was there in Kentucky, the night they recorded live. I highly recommend this!
0812513495|5.0|Young Ender Wiggin is a six-year-old boy who is expected to become the best commander ever in Earth's military history.  Mankind is hoping that he will be good enough to lead Earth in a battle to defeat alien \\"Buggers\\" that might take over our homeland.  <BR>     Ender goes through levels in his military training starting at \\"Battle School\\", where kids learn to fight in a war-like game and learn simple battle tactics.  Ender is a quick learner and is advanced to higher levels at school, until he becomes commander of a school army.  Eventually Ender gains knowledge of all battle techniques and becomes a great teacher.  At an extremely young age, after mastering everything at \\"Battle School\\", Ender is moved on to \\"Command School\\", skipping \\"Tactics School\\".<BR>     At \\"Command School\\", Ender is isolated from the older boys and plays a new game called \\"The Simulator\\" all by himself.  During the rest of his day he is taught by the old commander, Mazer Rackham, who was able to stop the \\"Buggers\\" the first time they invaded Earth.  Ender soon gets to play a new version of \\"The Simulator\\", where he gets to contact his old friends at \\"Battle School\\" over a \\"walkie talkie\\" device.  Ender is the commander and leads his friends.  They learn to fight vs. the computer and end up winning every battle set up for them.  In the end Ender finds out the computer was actually the \\"Buggers\\" and he was commanding Earth's army along with his friends. <BR>     I recommend Enders Game to any reader, because Mr. Card is able to make the main character Ender, relate to the reader and make the story seem real.  When you finish reading the book you just have to sit there and think about how captivating the book was.  While reading the story, you read Ender's thoughts and it helps bring him to life.  Once you start reading the story, you'll never want to put the book down.  The book can also help you to understand life better and teach you a little bit about military tactics.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I first heard this album while shopping in a gift shop-- the haunting timbre of the voice captivated me!  The gift shop owner told me the artist and I purchased the CD soon thereafter.  Ms. Jones' talent far exceeds any expectations for a &quot;first album&quot;.  She can and does hold her own with the likes of Sade and Billie Holiday.  I've let friends borrow the CD, and they too, have gone out and purchased the CD.  Great album, great sound, great quality!
0393037010|5.0|Master and Commander is the first book in Patrick O'Brian's much lauded Aubrey/Maturin series.  Like C.S. Forester, O'Brian sets this novel (along with the rest of the series) in the tumultuous years of the Nepoleonic Wars and likewise, O'Brian's Jack Aubrey and Steven Maturin serve in Great Britian's Royal Navy. However, unlike Forester, O'Brian's frequent confrontation of the seemer side of naval warfare as well as Georgian society render his tales far more grittier and therefore, much more true to life.  Furthermore, O'Brian's skillful combination of nineteenth century custom, language, and historical events makes these tales absolutely engaging in their overall sense of realism.  You can taste the salt permiating the air, feel the cold sea spray blowing in your face, hear the thunderous roar and see the brilliant flash of cannon and smell the acrid powder smoke as it stings your nostrils.<br />As for the characters themselves, Jack Aubrey is the ingratiatingly sanguineous and impulsive Commander of H.M.S. Sophie who's impolitic and indiscrete shoreside antics continually taint his otherwise brilliant nautical career.  Counterbalancing Aubrey is H.M.S. Sophie's surgeon, the eminent Dr. Steven Maturin who is possessed of a wonderfully melancholic and self-abusive nature.  Both protaginists are made all the more fascinating for their individual peccadillos. In Master and Commander, Aubrey and Maturin embark on a series of lively adventures, which take place on both the land and the sea. The result of these increasingly enthralling encounters is the open revelation of their particular strengths along with the uncompromisng exposure of their peculiar weaknesses. Meanwhile, a solid foundation is laid for what becomes, in subsequent books, perhaps one of the most intriguing friendships in all of literature.
0140185232|3.0|It is difficult to say what this book is about.  Most people describe it as centered around the spiritual growth of what you might call the protagonist, Larry.  That it is, without a doubt.  But I think if it is centered around Larry, he is a foundation, or a backbone, around which the rest of the book rotates.  You'll note how much time Maugham spends describing other people.  I think that the purpose of the book isn't so much to tell Larry's story as it is to explore how people react and compare to Larry, to see why they don't find enlightenment.  You'll find an abundance of inspiration in this book, but for any actual guides to enlightenment I would recommend reading the books that Larry himself reads, rather than getting too excited over this one.<br />That said, the book has a tremendous amount of compassion for its characters, and Maugham treats the story with great enthusiasm and interest.  I think the author's attitude itself (he being a character) is a spiritual point of view that would be easy to miss.  But I cannot write a review without saying that the book is stylistically flawed.  The characters seem very mechanical and two-dimensional: they represent their designated manner of living far too perfectly, I think, to have any dramatic appeal or to be identified with smoothly.  It's a lot like an Ayn Rand novel in that way.  The dialogue, too, seems a bit stylized, and the descriptive passages can get formulaic in a bad way.  But still the author's talent shines through in several passages, and there is plenty to think about.  So don't miss this one, but don't expect a miracle.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Quite possibly.  And maybe the best movie about war ever. Its an expensive set to be sure but for many fans its hard to put a price tag on this level of quality seldom seen on TV or on the Big Screen.  <br />The first 5 or so episodes are a bit hard to get into because there are so many characters and it doesn't focus on just a few to build up tension in a standard dramatic fashion.  But by the time you get to Episode 10 and watch the excellent documentary \\"We Stand Alone Together\\"  you'll want to watch the series all over again.  I did, and again and again.  Upon repeat viewings you get a deeper appreciation for all stories and details you didn't pick up before.  Every expression more touching and every words of caution, humour, friendship, and frustration more meaningful.<br />They did a fabulous job of bringing big movie quality to the small screen.  Its no wonder HBO has built such a solid reputation by commiting to projects like this. This series isn't merely entertainment but a fitting monument to the men of Easy Company and moreover all the men and women who triumphed against a World War.  Minor details were changed from the book by Stephen Ambrose but nothing to detract from the overall integrity of the project.  Or perhaps they were factual corrections Ambrose made after the fact?  Regardless, the stories of people like Maj Winters, Nixon, Lipton, Speirs, Guarnere, Liebgott, \\"Bull\\" Randallman, Webster, and others have touched me deeply in the year 2002.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I bought this CD late because my local CD store ran out the day it was released, and I didn't have the foresight to reserve one before the release date. The music on this untitled album is simply sublime.  I always thought music was meant to convey something for which there are no words, a feeling of happiness, sadness, highness,...something.  I can find no words to describe this album, except to say that I am utterly enchanted with it... and  I have great discerning taste, or so I am told...<br />Obviously if you're new to this genre, it may take you a while to appreciate it.  But if you already own Agaetis Byrjun (and loved it as much as I do), then buy this: You won't regret it.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I knew that this movie was based on fiction. But I've got something to be made me think hard. John F. Nash is a real character. He is a famous economist. Also he made a great contiribution towards economy and mathematics. In the end he won a Nobel Prize for economics in 1994.<BR>      But this movie focuses on his inner life. He had the ability to collect and arrange numbers and letters. He was a genius, but he was schizophrenic. He had confounded real things with imaginary things. He wanted to escape from the sticky situation. Finally he found  the solution and overcome a dease.<BR>       I majored in economics at university. Well, I have been taught his theories. But I was more interested in his self-consciousness than his achievements. Whoever has handicap that is unwilling to be concealed. It is apt to be difficult to overcome such a thing. This movie shows us the way to solve and the importance of making much of ourselves.<BR>       If you have some problems, watch this movie!...And it'll help you to solve the questions. Try it right now!!
B00005J6RE|3.0|Volume 27 of The Star Trek DVD series contains two of the second season's typical plots. Both episodes are watchable and entertaining However neither of these episodes are not the most successful variations of these blueprint plots.<br />THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER is one of those man v.s. machine episodes of Star Trek. Only this time Kirk must sit and watch the Enterprise be contolled by a computer called the M-5 rather than his crew. At first the M-5 seems as flawless as it's creator Daystrom says. Of course the computer goes haywire and begins destroying Starfleet ships. Sure this episode is written ok and all but we've seen this a thousand times before and it's been done better. Still this episode's story is entertaining and worth at least one watch but it is at best a standard Star Trek episode.<br />THE OMEGA GLORY follows a similar pattern as THE ULTIMATE COMPUTER. This is a typical second season Star Trek episode but it is by far one of the worst varaitions of the whole \\"journey to an unknown planet run by a cruel race or empire\\" plots. In a somewhat patriotic episode where the planet is run by Comms (chinese communists) led by a insane Starfleet Captain (Morgan Woodward from DAGGER OF THE MIND). When the Comms are excuting violent slaves called Yanks (as in Yankee) this episode gets a little far fetched. A few suprises here and there, but other than that THE OMEGA GLORY is a below average episode of Star Trek in my opinion. Partly because it's story is pretty far fetched and disappointing in the end. Also because this plot has been done to death in Star Trek and far better other times.<br />Overall a decent collection of standard Star Trek shows. There is really nothing super special here but if you love classic Trek then you probably will want to get this DVD. Mildly recommended.
B00003ZKSP|5.0|SLipknot's first major label release was easily one of the best albums of that year (late 1999 early 2000) and one of th best albums as a whole in quite sometime. <br />Not since Korn's debut self title had there been another band that made a new, progrossive and ingenuitive sound. Sure, there had been some here and there but none really that changed the game in while. When this first came out, I was on the bandwagon right away because (from a musical point of view), I hadn't heard anything like it before. I've never seen a band bring together 3 drummers/percussionists, a DJ, a Sampler,2 Guitars and a Bass and vocals and put it together and make this wall of sound like they did.<br />The extra bonus release is the one you definitely want to get because not only does it have ever song on the album but it has some bonus songs like a different version of &quot;Spit It Out&quot; and &quot;Wait and Bleed&quot; and a live version of &quot;Surfacing&quot;, also some B sides that were never released. Very cool!<br />If you haven't gotten a chance to check out Slipknot and you have a very good appreciation of music, then you should definitely get this one because you'll be impressed (artistically) and there really is no dull moment on this album because it's very fast, very thrash and still there are some songs that will definately haunt you, like the last track before the bonus material &quot;Scissors&quot;. Again, don't sleep on this one!
B00005UW7G|5.0|This is NOT one of those boring performances on a stage,<BR>it IS a high quality movie filmed on location in Venice.<BR>IT HAS HOLLIWOOD STYLE SPECIAL EFFECTS !-- like lightning,<BR>controlled weather, and even a real statue (colossus) chase<BR>after Don Giovanni. Like ALL movies employing special effects,<BR>there are scenes were the singing is pre-recorded and the <BR>acting done seperately-- but this lip-sinking is infrequent.<BR>The only time it is evident is when the statue is animated.<BR>Actually, the statue's frozen face adds to the effect that it<BR>is POSSESSED, and NOT an actor !<BR>THE FILM IS SO EXCELLENT THAT IT WOULD EVEN BE GOOD IF IT WAS<BR>JUST A PLAIN MOVIE-- AS AN OPERA IS IS SOMETHING SENSATIONAL !!!<BR>The Dolby surround sound has great singing; nevertheless, like<BR>some Dolby recordings the volume seems too low--this is the<BR>only bad thing about it. The staging even adds to the story,<BR>for example: who is the \\"vampire-boy\\" following people around?<BR>(He actually seems to be an angel,or demon, judging the scene.) The nude girls represent tragic abuse of inocence. Are those places real?  Is the lightning the wrath of God? --    (actually, it is).<BR>THIS IS REALLY TOO GREAT A OPERA/MOVIE TO MISS !!!!!
B000002H97|5.0|This is simply the best CD I have ever heard from Metallica.  Most of their songs before this CD had been, as a friend of mine and I say, \\"more of the 'kill kill kill!' variety\\".  However, this CD proves that Metallica is capeable of singing songs with nice lyrics, such as \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"The Unforgiven\\".  There are still several \\"harder\\" songs on this CD, such as \\"The Struggle Within\\", for those people that like that.  Overall, I'd have to recommend this CD to people already interested in Metallica (obviously) but also to people interested in stuff like Nirvana, Van Halen, and (maybe) even Journey.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina's new CD does show she has matured not only as a singer, but most of all as a writer.  If you expect to have the same listen as her debut album though, you will be quite disappointed.  I myself am a long time Christina fan and my first listen to \\"Stripped\\" was a bit anti-climactic.  Her self titled debut was full of pop confections that made you move your body with the rhythm(Genie in a Bottle, Come on Over, and What a Girl Wants), which I really enjoyed.  When she released \\"Dirrty\\" as the first song from \\"Stripped,\\" I was expecting the same sound to play in the album.  \\"Stripped\\" on the other hand is full of ballads that shows Christina's vocal talents(though a bit more controlled).  She has created an album with more depth and substance.  It shows us that the little girl that we listened to a few years ago is definitely not a girl anymore, rather a woman.  Songs such as Impossible(her colaboration with Alica Keys) and Beautiful(written by Linda Perry, formerly of 4-Non Blondes fame) prove that she has the vocal prowess to deliver songs with the right emotions to convey the lyrics to the listener.  There are interludes that could have been left out and the song \\"Make Over\\" that I would consider a filler that could have been cut from the album entirely(it sounded more like a song P!nk would be singing). Other songs such as \\"Fighter\\"(rock) and \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\"(hip/hop) proves that she can sing different genres of music.  Bottom line, a few more plays on my radio and actually reading the lyrics to her song, Christina has definitely achieved what she wanted to do with her follow up to her debut album.  A more mature sounding, powerful  album that provides the listener an insight on how much Christina has grown from her Mickey Mouse Club days.  She definitely has the talent to go further in her career.
B00005O438|5.0|...Featuring a rabid St. Benard who turns into a vicious killing machine who traps a wife and child in a broken down car in the middle of nowhere, Cujo takes suspense to a whole new level.<br />Sure, the first half of the film is pretty paint by numbers stuff that features no horror and gore whasoever, but that was so you can get acquainted with the characters.... Cujo is technically an innocent victim of an evil disease, you can see that King didn't want this to be the typical \\"evil dog vs. caring owners\\" storyline... but basically ir comes down to a dog named Cujo getting bitten by a rabid bat. He then goes on a killing spree. Tad Trenton and his mom go to a farm to get their car fixed. Too bad when they get there, the people who were supposed to fix the car get killed by the dog. Then, the car breaks down, and all hell breaks loose.<br />The problems with the movie are few, but deadlier than the vicious streak of Cujo. The movie is too boring early on, and the ending sucks a big one. Plus, the DVD features no extras whatsoever, just improved sound quality and scene selection. The visuals are the same as they were in the 80's, so dont expect anything too great.<br />This is not a revolutionary film by any means, but Cujo delivers what King wanted it to: a tale of evil vs. good, but with shades of gray. And Cujo just looks too cool to be ignored for long. I reccommend seeing this movie without a doubt. It is one of my favorite horror movies of all time.
B00006V9A0|5.0|After all these years, we finnaly get to hear new Nirvana, well not really new, but unreleased. I was VERY excited to get this cd, Mainly just because of \\"You Know Your Right.\\" However I'm a bit dissapointed at the tracklisting. Why are only 14 songs on this cd? Nirvana came out with 5 cds. Why is there only one track from Bleach? <BR>They could have added \\"Big Cheese\\" or \\"Love Buzz\\" or \\"Negetive Creep\\" or \\"Floyd The Barber\\"<br />From Nevermind they *SHOULD* have had \\"Polly\\" On there, I have no idea why that wasnt, that's a great nirvana song and I hear it on the radio all the time. Then You could have put \\"On a Plain\\" , \\"Lounge Act\\", \\"Breed\\"<br />And then From In Utero you could have Put \\"Milk It\\", \\"Scentless Apprentice\\". <br />You also have \\"Incesticide \\" which you SHOULD have defently had Aneurysm and then from \\"Unpluged in New York\\" They Needed \\"Where did you sleep last night\\" I heard that was on Europian Versions, but it should have been on the regular version. Perhaps even \\"Jesus Dont want me for a sunbeam\\"<br />The point i'm getting at is, They have no real excuse for not having some of these extra tracks. This cd was basically just pumped out so it could be available for the christmas season. Courtney just had to get her way.....She dosent really care at all about the Nirvana fans who've been waiting for this CD!<br />I bought this CD for just YNYR. And for that alone I give this CD 5 stars, I think it's one of Nirvana's best tunes. The remastering is ok, most songs sound the same but \\"Been a Son\\" Was great and so was Pennyroyal Tea. <br />So if someone you know wants to get into Nirvana, this might be a good christmas gift for them or something. But really, there isn't anything new on this. <br />Atleast we are supposed to get the Box set......I hope we do...
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Having a toddler, we didn't have the chance to see this film in a theater so we were very pleased to receive a complementary copy from Disney, and have watched the film many times in the past week. The movie a real Disney classic in the sense that it appeals to children and adults. The introduction tells the story of a selfish prince who, being uncharitable and unkind to an old woman, is turned into a beast while his castle and servants are enchanted. They can only be returned to their natural state if the prince falls in love, and is loved in return, before the last petal drops off an enchanted rose. The animation and Menken-Ashman songs are some of Disney's best. The film deserved its Oscar nomination, and you can see why it became a successful Broadway musical.<br />You could spend days looking through all the dvd material. If you've seen the special editions of Snow White or Monsters, Inc. you'll know what to expect. There are two discs: the first contains three versions of the film -- the original theatrical release, the IMAX theater edition with the new song 'Human Again', and a fascinating \\"work-in-progress\\" version that alternates between pencilled, cartooned and fully animated representations. Disc Two contains many dvd extras. There are games, trivia quizzes, featurettes about the making of the film as well as the musical on Broadway, two music videos, and excellent features showing the behind-the-scenes doings of cast, voice work and art. Our favorite extras were Mrs. Potts' Personality Profile Game, where you answer several questions and are told which character you most resemble, and \\"The Story Behind the Story\\" where celebrities recount the origins of many Disney tales, including The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Jungle Book, Mulan, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Beauty & the Beast. I really enjoy seeing the layouts and designs, and how the animations are drawn and developed. The trivia games are lots of fun, and IMHO they work better than the games requiring navigation with the remote.<br />Packaging and foldout look very nice and, with so many options, are extremely helpful for finding the features you're interested in. We are very happy with this excellent family film and the many extra features included.ring navigation with the remote.<br />Packaging and foldout look very nice and, with so many options, are extremely helpful for finding the features you're interested in.

B00006ADFL|5.0|This is such a beautiful movie, and wacked out at the same time.  I highly recommend this.  Its surprising to see the director of Dead Alive make something as heartwarming as this, and its based on a true story.
B00006L83N|3.0|This, one of Symphony X's finest moments, bears the title \\"The Odyssey\\" However, the final/title track is the only part of the album that bears any allusion to Homer's masterpiece work.<br />  First, the opening track is quite typcial (and of course, amazing) Symphony X work. Plenty of didily-crazybeats. Allen's vocals only get better with every album. There is definitely nothing to complain about concerning the music of this album. The final track, opens with an amazing (obviously MIDI) orchestra introducing Odysseus' theme and the overture to the story. The lyrics of each track on this album are a different story. Not bad, but \\"Twilight On Olympus\\" definitely far surpasses these. I think what hurt the lyrics on the final track, is the fact that they're trying to sum up the entire story in 24 min.<br />  Overall, this is definitely a great album, with a phenomenal and breathtaking cover art design and plenty of impressing musical moments. So pick this up, if \\"V\\" and \\"Damnation Game\\" was your thing. Otherwise, this may not be your thing
B000001IQH|4.0|Sure this is a great album by a great band. But i have to say that this cannot be rated as highly as BLITZ and their VOICE OF A GENERATION album. I have a copy of RANCID doing a cover of 'someones gonna die'. Rancid fans should check out the origional BLITZ version.

6301972139|2.0|Moulin Rouge traces the life of artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and his paintings of the famous French nightclub.  Jose Ferrer gives a strong, emotionally controlled performance as the crippled artist who is unable to accept love in his life.  A large part of the film centres on his relationship with a streetwalker tiringly overplayed by Colette Marchand.  Not a great deal of time is actually spent in the Moulin Rouge, which is unfortunate since it may have injected some needed life into the story.  The film left me cold.  Toulouse-Lautrec had a very difficult personality (at least as portrayed in this film), making him a hard character to relate to, and there wasn't enough spectacle or life in the story to at least hold on to.  I wish I could add to the raves about this film, but for me it was a very unsatisfying viewing experience.
B000000JO3|5.0|Without showing any disrespect to any other hardcare band punk band, this is album is all you need to know about hardcore punk.  This ablum is the hardcore masterpiece of the 80's period.  All of the new knockoff bands only wish they could make an album like this.
B00005U1YO|4.0|To begin, after the release of \\"surrender\\" in '99 I was a little [angry] on how poor the quality of the Brothers music had degraded.  It's like watching a kids television programs on Ether. Let's be realistic, there are a few good tracks on \\"Surrender\\" but the rest of the album's just plain [bad]. Yet there is a sort of redemption with \\"Come With Us\\". Tracks 2 and 3 are great, \\"Denmark\\" has a great beat, and lastly \\"the Test\\" ends the album with a hell of a punch.  People who don't like this album are people who have set a standard from the first two albums (which by the way are very well made).  In a way I used to fall into that catagory as well, but this album sets a new stage that the Chemical Brothers handle very well.  I liked this album so much, when I saw it on vinyl I didn't hesitate to get that too (I soon gave my CD to a close friend).
0792842723|4.0|This is a great action movie, with a great plot and special effects.  But the only reason that i gave it a 4 is because it was missing a good 2nd action scene to get ya hooked to it.  It has 3 main action sequences, the facility battle, the archives/st.petersburg tank chase, and the satellite base battle.  Most movies have a second action scene to get them against the bad guys of the movie.  We won't really recognize a villain until about more than an hour into the movie, when bond starts fighting.  Tomorrow never dies had 5 main action scenes,   the intro fight, the complex shootout, the car chase, the motorcycle chase, and the end battle.  the car chase and the complex shoot-out is what every movie needs to introduce the bad guys and everything.  In goldeneye, you see the facility intro, then u hav eto wait another hour until another action scene graces the screen.  IF they would've only wrote in a way where bond was at the Bunker complex, so he would know that orumoz and Xenia were the bad guys, and no one would believe them.  it would also be a thrilling action sequence, with natyla and james escaping form the blast and fighting orumoz and Xenia.  what s shame
0792157869|5.0|It's close, but I choose this one over Raiders of the Lost Ark, thanks to the great chemistry between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery, who plays Indy's dad.  Great action (gotta love Indy chasing the tank), great suspense (those booby traps are downright frightening), great humor(find out how Indy got his hat, whip, chin scar, and fear of snakes, all in five minutes!), this one has it all.
067101756X|5.0|One of the best UFO books period.  This is the book that I recommend to non-believers in the UFO phenomenon.  Although the book is full of important information, I get the feeling Corso was holding back.  I think he knew more than he wrote in this book. One also has to wonder what physical material was retained by USAF when it was seperated from the Army. If the Army's foriegn technology department retained a portion of the material then what did the Air Force manage to hide away? <br />Without a doubt this book is a must read for anyone even remotely interested in this subject.

B00006HAZG|5.0|This was an inspiring dvd to watch, it went through a life story of a infant to a young man... <BR>the characters in this extraorindary film were intriguing and always grabbed my attention in some way...<BR>seems that i watched it with my class, it has captured our attention and made us realise what it was like living in the late 1800's and how lucky and fotunate we are...<BR>the only thing that i didnt like about this was that it was very predictable...<BR>It is was  good as Harry Potter Because the characeters are so a like. Why? because they are the same people. Aunt betsey is as good as an Actress in her days of David Copperfield as when she was Professor McGonagall, David may be a little older in Harry Potter, but he still has the talent (and his winking in one eye) and as you would know, the evil wicked Mrs Murdstone is the lovely witch who teaches Harry to fly - Madam Hooch.i would reccomend this movie to anyone whol likes a bit of everything..
B00006HAZG|4.0|I enjoyed this film very, very much i thought it was sad, romantic and happy all in 1!!<br />This movie really moved me and it had some very funny parts and some not so funny!<BR>This movie starts sad then it's happy then sad again and this movie just keeps following this pattern.<br />The lady who played Peggotty was a great actress who really suited this part, without Peggotty in this movie it would have been pretty Boring!!<BR>Another great actress was the lady who played Betsy Trotwood at the start we all though she was a heartless bitchy old woman but in the end her bitchiness just came from her terrible Heartbreak.<BR>But we can't forget the Best Actor and the main actor the young boy who played David Copperfield!! He was a wonderful actor and when he was sad we all felt his hurt.<br />This was a great movie but sometimes i thought it was a bit much, when David gets older everyone is in trouble or dying, i think it all happened too quickly, like it was squashed in all at once!!<br />Is this young boy a better actor in David Copperfield or Harry Potter??!!
B00006NSGX|4.0|First of all I am a HUGE Clapton fan and have followed his career for a long time. I had been waiting for this CD set ever since I found out about it 2 months ago.  That said I have to say that while this is a good set it's not great.  The set starts with Eric playing acoustic on the first 4-5 cuts. The songs are excellent but let's face it we all expect Clapton to wail!!  The electric tunes are OK and Claptons playing seems methodical rather than inspired, especially on cuts like &quot;Have you ever loved a woman&quot; and &quot;Layla&quot;. It's though they taped this set late in the tour and he is going through the motions rather then displaying the passion that has lead to some incredible music.  The back up band is excellent with Billy Preston, David Sancious and Steve Gadd but there are time when Clapton relinquishes the lead of the song to keyboards (yawn).  This is supposed to be his last tour as he has said that he is tired of touring.  With this album and Pilgrim I hope that he will take some time to record an album that truly shows his passion and master of the guitar rather than laid back music.  The sound on the CD is excellent and there are even 2 video clips on the Cd's that can be played in your PC.  Overall it's good but not great...
B000005GWE|5.0|Pat and Sco! 'Nuff said.  I have to admit that this one threw me off balance initially. They don't play necessarily in the matter that you might expect them to.  They cover a wide range of material that incorporates the best of their capabilities.  Steve Swallow and the venerable Bill Stewart round out this quartet.  Mr. Stewart is essential to the drive factor in this recording.  This quartet SWINGS! They groove.  The ballads are also good.  When you have to such good guitarists you don't much more than a quartet. They fill up the spaces nicely. They play off each other wonderfully.  The chops are impressive but this isn't a chops-fest. There is substance as well as virtuosity here.   I was thrilled with this recording when I bought and it has grown on me over the years.      A sequel recording would be nice.
B00006CXXU|3.0|In the aftermath of a fast-fading TRL wreckage lies Christina Aguileras Stripped. The sophomore effort finds the twenty-something struggling to find an identity in a crowded arena of Baby-One-More-Timers and aging boy bands. Rashly vying for distance and maturity, it is an album battling the contending forces of art versus image: focusing primarily on her rise to stardom and how she copes with the media drama that has menaced her career. Aguilera sings with the tenacity pop-vet, licking her wounds and combating innocence with midriffs.<br />Stripped exhibits a strange pluralism. In this video age where image is everything, we find Aguilera juggling between two artistic dilemmas: 1) follow the trends that are currently popular on MTV and bare all for maximum record sales, or, 2) focus on musical artistry and great album making. With Munchausen-like flippancy, Aguileras album jumps from innate innocence and optimistic odes of belonging to sexual provocation and sticky club anthems with Camus-like anxiety. Leading one to question if Stripped is the diary of a rising talent or a calculated career move? The artist and the album struggle to find purpose.<br />Sorry, if I aint perfect, Sorry, I dont give a (what). Sorry, I aint a diva. Sorry, just know what I want. Sorry, Im not a virgin. Sorry, Im not a ...  I wont let you break me, think what you want, chimes a biting Christina Aguilera. The songstress flaunts a haughty level of braggadocio thats usually set aside for artists of much higher prestige  particularly those with more albums under their belt. She fronts with a level of self-assuredness normally reserved only for war-weathered divas.<br />The saving grace of Stripped is Christinas voice. Her honey-ladled soprano is more luscious than ever, exuding a sensual melodiousness. Lyrically, the album is confessional and much deeper than her first, due to her participation in songwriting this time around. Aguilera taps into her inner self in Im OK, a powerful and shocking look into her past in which sings about the abusive relationship she had her father. In addition, her teaming with former 4-Non Blondes front woman and Pink collaborator Linda Perry proves fruitful on Cruz, while her duets with a slue of urban radio mainstays from Lil Kim (Cant Hold Us Down) to Alicia Keys (Impossible) are delectable. <br />With the TRL generation running scared and all of its ilk ducking for cover: some to rock (Pink), and others to R&B (Justin Timberlake), and some just not-quite-anywhere (Britney Spears), Aguilera manages to salvage one innate gift: her voice  and when its all said and done, thats where she truly shines.
0679734767|1.0|We were always told in school to read the classics...and so, having embarked on an attempt to do this, I find it very uninspiring.  Just as interesting as Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde novel is both unexciting and a waste of time.  Maybe the modern day media has dullened my senses, maybe I have become anaesthetized to the twists and turns of this timeless classic.  Then again, maybe it is hugely overrated by literature readers who get their cues from the 1940's.
0790740443|4.0|---<br />SOLDIER is very good praxeological (\\"soft\\") speculative fiction in that it employs thoughtful extrapolation of sociological and psychological trends to establish the premises upon which it is based. What's more, anyone who decries Kurt Russell's work in this film betrays an ignorance of acting and a lack of good taste that fits the silly booger perfectly for a career as a newspaper movie critic. More punishing insult I cannot possibly offer.<br />The problem with this movie is that there are aspects of the production that beat the living hell out of us \\"hard\\" science fiction fen. Back in 1969, in his essay \\"Science Fiction: its nature, faults and virtues\\" (*The Science Fiction Novel*), Robert A. Heinlein made the following comment on the genre:<br />\\"A handy short definition of almost all science fiction might read: realistic speculation about possible future events, based solidly on adequate knowledge of the real world, past and present, and on a thorough understanding of the nature and significance of the scientific method.<br />\\"To make this definition cover all science fiction (instead of 'almost all') it is necessary only to strike out the word 'future.'\\"<br />In 1981, Heinlein followed up in \\"Ray Guns and Space Ships\\" (*Expanded Universe*) with:<br />\\"Science Fiction is speculative fiction in which the author takes as his first postulate the real world as we know it, including all established facts and natural laws. The result can be extremely fantastic in content, but it is not fantasy; it is legitimate -- and often very tightly reasoned -- speculation about the possibilities of the real world. This category excludes rocket ships that make U-turns, serpent men of Neptune that lust after human maidens, and stories by authors who flunked their Boy Scout merit badge tests in descriptive astronomy.\\"<br />And that last particularly sums up the true science fiction fan's problems with SOLDIER. Posit a spacegoing civilization and tell me, please, that they would ever bother going through the expense (economic as well as thermodynamic) and bother of hauling refined metal and other salvagable scrap materials out of one gravity well and then carelessly dumping the stuff on the surface of a planet somewhere else (i.e., at the bottom of yet *ANOTHER* gravity well). Even if they were planning future colonization of that windy mudball, anyone but a mundane (or a dimwitted fan of \\"soft\\" sci-fi) would know that all that junk could be more efficiently and cost-effectively used in a microgravity environment (in other words: up in orbit) as raw materials for any contemplated new manufactures. Once you've achieved the technology necessary for spaceflight, it's simply easier and less costly to make most rough and finished goods in space than on a planetary surface. That's true today, and cannot be otherwise in the future.<br />The whole of this idiocy is summed up by the director's use of a particularly gormless background image: a bloody great aircraft carrier flopped over on its port side (apparently the *USS Franklin Delano Roosevelt* -- like you couldn't set the damned thing down on its keel?) with the island superstructure sticking up at a 45-degree angle. Yeesh.<br />SOLDIER is an entertaining movie, and I extoll Kurt Russell's work in this film. He is generally quite horribly underappreciated as an actor, and his professionalism -- here as elsewhere -- is beyond reproach. This having been said, would it have killed the silly sonsabitches responsible for the production values in SOLDIER to have gotten input from some people who understand \\"established facts and natural laws\\" and who aren't (like writer David Webb Peoples, director Paul W.S. Anderson, and production designer David L. Sawyer) total and absolute mundane cement-heads?<br /><br />---------<br />Note: One of the earlier reviewers mentioned that SOLDIER is set in the same plenum as the inappropriately-titled 1982 movie BLADE RUNNER (drawn, like so many of the past two decades' ghodawful dimwitted \\"skiffy\\" flicks, from the work of hack SF writer Philip K. Dick [1928-1982], who is the unspeakably mundane Modern Language Association's present-day darling, his signal claim to fame being a Hugo Award given for THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE [1963], and who has been for the most part largely -- and rightfully -- ignored by hard science fiction fen). The reviewer's surmise is incorrect, as there are also in-joke references to a bunch of other sci-fi movies, including Russell's own ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and the Star Trek film THE WRATH OF KHAN.two decades' ghodawful dimwitted \\"skiffy\\" flicks, from the work of hack SF writer Philip K.

0440224764|4.0|Patrick planned it for days.  He disappeared and stole the 90 million dollars from his own firm.  He watched his own funeral, and everyone thought he died in a car crash.  He would get a new life, without any marriage or work problems.  But it had come to the end.  People headed by Stepano who were working for Benny, the client of the firm who would have received 60 million dollars of the money, and the life insurance companies who paid his wife Trudy, had found him in Brazil.  He was being tutored and with all the pain they managed to get a name from him: Eva Miranda.<br />Eva knew that if Patrick didnt call, then he had been caught.  She had to call the FBI and tell them that Patrick had been caught so they wouldnt kill him.  She had to immediately start moving the money from different banks.  She then bought a ticket out of the country and would have to watch her back.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to others.  If you like mysteries, then you would definitely enjoy this book. It is very entertaining and interesting to read.  It is a quick and interesting read.  Although this might not be my favorite of the books Ive read by John Grisham, it was still a great book.
0060987464|5.0|This book is by far the best biography I have ever read. It is unlike any other you will probably ever read in your life. Manson starts off the book by telling stories from his childhood and from his days in school. It goes on to telling about how the band got started, stories of bad trips, bad relationships, etc. How it differs from most biographies, is that it has some of his artwork in it, and stories that he has wrote to an editor of a magazine (hoping that the editor would publish these stories in the magazine.)<br />I liked Manson's music before I read this -- but I think that even if you disliked Manson's music, you would still enjoy this book. It is fascinating, and I guarantee once you start this book, you wont be able to put it down.

B00005JGAF|5.0|ROCKET TO RUSSIA was released in mid-1977, the height of the cold war and in the middle of the horrible period in US Music know as Disco.  Most ignorant Amricans fail to realize this was also a time for cutting edge music known as american Punk Rock. I love this album (CD) i wore out the vinyl version I had.  This is cleanest, leanest, meanest and refined production. Ya have to buy it.
B000002NIW|5.0|deftones once again shows how much they can rock. every song on here makes you impatient till their next album comes out. You just can't get tired of their music. Deftones is a great way to let out stress. They have awesome tunes and the screaming is just perfect, not too much, but not too little. One of my favorites is be quiet and drive, it just makes you want to listen to it over and over again. i have had this cd for quite some time and i can still listen to it as though it were my first. if you are patient enough or scroll your forward button on the last track, eventually there'll be a hidden track that just makes you happy the cd wasn't over yet. a cd you have to have, no doubt.

0553269631|4.0|Published during the second World War, this novel takes an in-depth look into the lives of unique characters who throughout American history have come to epitomize the label of \\"different\\", \\"outcast\\", \\"weird\\", \\"freak\\" or \\"misfit\\".  There is a character in the book that everyone can identify with and come to understand their world from a more insightful perspective.  McCullers makes a brilliant showcase of life not as it should be or how we hope it will some day become, but as it is, without artifice or evasion.  She allows us to look at ourselves without pity or self-loathing and without rationalization or retribution.  We can see ourselves simply as human.  If the definition of a literary classic is a title that stands the test of time, this novel certainly deserves that distinction.
6301963695|2.0|Not what I was hoping for.  It does not have very much plot and the romantic scenes are not that great.  I almost fell asleep.  I was bored a few minutes into it and would not recomend it.

B00006FXB6|5.0|Although nu-metal would have one of questionable intelligence wonder, real honest rock music still exists and still thrives unabashed. Queens Of The Stone Age are the finest example of this statement to date. In a day and age where pop music is slowly losing its foothold on America's youth and nu-metal is showing signs of weakness, rock seems to once again be making a comeback and QOTSA are leading the way. Blending heavy riffs with catchy melodic hooks and excellent sung vocals blended with punkish screams, you start to get the basic feel of an album that, once fully explored, displays a lot of musical diversity and talent from a band soon to become a household name. As a recent convert myself, it's only a matter of time before the world stands up and recognizes the new saviors of rock music.
B00005AQE8|5.0|Yea I've had this for a long time, but everytime I put it back in my player I can't take it out.  Despite what people say, I think the 2nd cd is just as good as the first.  It doesn't have the hits of the first cd but just listen to it and you'll love it.  Best cd ever!!!
B0000634EV|5.0|Along with &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot;, Down: II has held my attention as record of the year without having to try. Some people have been disappointed with this album because they were expecting more metallic riffs similar to &quot;NOLA&quot; but honestly, the diversity is what makes this album so special. It opens with total Sabbath-esque heaviness that one would expect from Down and by &quot;Stained Glass Cross&quot;, you are fed a more up-tempo number that brings to mind a number of 70s legends. Some of the most shining moments are featured in &quot;Where I'm Going&quot; which house Pepper Keenan playing a steel guitar with Phil Anselmo singing (not screaming) and moments like this simply bleed passion. From there, you have a healthy mix of total heaviness, almost a jazz-swing vibe and a hefty Zeppelin-esque &quot;Ballad of Evermore&quot; style track which goes out like the calm before the storm. This one is a standout for the ages. (Coincidentally, the chorus riff of &quot;There's Something On My Side&quot; is the heaviest thing ever written by anyone.)

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I think I would rather hear Johnny Cash sing than anyone else on God's green earth.  This album once again proves that Johnny is still a great songwriter with three originals (&quot;The Man Comes Around&quot;, &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot;, and &quot;Tear Stained Letter&quot;) that truly get to the heart of one of America's true living icons.  He puts a new gutwrenching and tear-enducing spin on Nine Inch Nails melodrama &quot;Hurt,&quot; duets with Fiona Apple on the Simon and Garfunkel gem &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Waters,&quot; adds a little country blues to Depeche Mode's &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; sings directly to June Carter Cash with The Beatles beautiful &quot;In My Life,&quot; shows up the Eagles with his take on &quot;Desperado,&quot; and duets with Nick Cave on Hank Williams' &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry,&quot; making each song truly his own.  He sings them as if he wrote them to the point of amazement.  Cash never fails to exceed expectations.  This album is a must have, as are the previous three American Recordings.  You just don't appreciate music unless you appreciate these albums, or any of Cash's work for that matter.  Johnny closes the album with a rousing version of the classic &quot;We'll Meet Again,&quot; complete with a choir of friends and family behind him on the last bit.  This song indicates that Cash is indeed aware that with his health, it may be his last album of material before he passes on.  It is a beautiful close to a beautiful album and a magnificent body of work that could never be matched.  Johnny's my hero.  I pray that we get more music from Cash before his time comes.  I certainly hope that we do meet again.
B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo is one of the most enjoyable ways to spend two hours and twenty one minutes of your life. I am a fan of Westerns, and of John Wayne movies, and this one is my favorite. My all-time favorite scene in a Western is in this film. While John Wayne and Dean Martin are doing their nightly walk through the town, Wayne's good friend Ward Bond is shot down in the street. He follows the shooter into a stable, with Martin guarding outside. When Wayne gets dust in his eyes the shooter flees. Martin was trying to check on Wayne when the shooter ran by. Martin fired at the guy, but didn't kill him. The shooter ran into the saloon filled with the bad guys. Martin knew that the killer would have muddy boots, so he checked each mans' feet. None of them were dirty, and they began to laugh at Martin, who was the town drunk. Just as he is doubting himself, Martin sees blood drip from overhead onto the bar. He takes a step, turns, and shoots into the rafters of the saloon. The killer falls down, dead. When he and Wayne inspect the killer, he has muddy boots, and a bloody leg, meaning that Martin did hit when he ran by. It's a great scene, and is worth the price of the DVD by itself.
B0000025F7|5.0|Personally, I feel this album was far better than Thriller. In fact, every song on this album is enjoyable. It brings me back to my childhood and the title song is the best on this album. If you're a fan of MJ, you'll love this album if you don't already own it. It's incredible!!!
B000002UB3|5.0|At the time of its release, Paul said it wasn't as good as \\"Pepper.\\" Later, John dismissed the entire album, and especially the medley. But, many, many fans still think this is the best Beatles record ever. I think it's one of the three best.<br />\\"Come Together\\" started off as a copy of Chuck Berry's \\"You Can't Catch Me,\\" complete with the \\"Here come old flat top\\" line, a Chuck Berry rhythm guitar lick and a chord progression that was too close for comfort. Paul claims it was his idea to slow it way down. John almost admitted to that in a 1969 interview. They got sued for the song anyway. But slowing it down gave Paul and Ringo plenty of room to work wonders. John's lyrics are fantastic, and some of my favorite lyrics by anybody. \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is another favorite. The chords are dark and moody, the rhythms exotic. The lyrics...ah, the lyrics. If, as the so-called critics purport, The Beatles were not quite mature when they wrote and sang songs like \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" - after all, these self-professed authorities would have us believe that the boys miraculously 'grew up' just before they recorded \\"Rubber Soul\\" - then what have we here, an exercise in primeval lust? \\"I want you.\\" \\"I want you so bad it's driving me mad.\\" \\"Ye-e-e-e-a-a-a-a-h!!!\\" Mr. Lennon, all grown up...my, my. Ya know what? I'm thankful The Beatles NEVER grew up. That's what kept the whole thing INTERESTING. The longing in this song is never fulfilled; he doesn't express that he actually \\"gets\\" her. Likewise, the tremendous tension built up by the long coda never resolves, but instead abruptly cuts off. This song is a masterpiece.<br />\\"Something\\" was George's first A side on a Beatles single. Ringo's drumming is noteworthy here; he interacts beautifully with the music. \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is the favorite of many. It is the antithesis of the previous tune. Where \\"I Want You\\" is imprisoned in its inveterate yearning, \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" frolics in joyous liberation.<br />John disliked \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and thought it unworthy to be a Beatles song. Written toward the end of the \\"White Album\\" sessions, it was rehearsed during the \\"Let It Be\\" sessions, but not recorded. The song seemed to be a problem for Paul no matter how hard he worked on it. Paul struggled for days to get a take that he liked, but was forced to compromise because of the impatience of the others. Even five days after the album was presumably finished and the running order had been established, Paul was still tinkering with \\"Maxwell's.\\" I don't think he was ever satisfied with it. I must admit that I do like it a lot better now than I did in 1969, but it's still a low point on the album. The same goes for \\"Octopus's Garden.\\"<br />For many, including myself, the medley is the high point of \\"Abbey Road.\\" The chord progressions are superb throughout, but that's usually a given with The Beatles. George Martin's orchestrations are brilliant - he understood their music perfectly. \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" has great mood contrasts. As \\"Sun King\\" ends, \\"Mean Mister Mustard\\" abruptly and completely awakens us out of the dreamy bliss. \\"Her Majesty\\" followed \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" in the initial mix. When Paul heard it, he didn't like it there and had \\"Her Majesty\\" removed. I think it was the right choice for two reasons: (1) \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" and \\"Polythene Pam\\" go together musically and lyrically - \\"His sister Pam works in a shop...,\\" \\"Have you seen Polythene Pam...\\"; and (2) \\"Sun King\\" has lulled us, \\"Mean Mr. Mustard\\" wakes us up, but it's so short, we're not ready for the subdued \\"Her Majesty\\" yet. When Paul heard \\"Her Majesty\\" at the very end (where it was temporarily placed by an engineer), he liked it there and kept it. \\"Polythene Pam,\\" is much faster and more aggressive than \\"Mean Mr. Mustard.\\" John's rhythmic treatment of the lyrics is different, too. There's a brilliant contrast between the characters of the two songs. Where do The Beatleslast sing \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\"? Right here. \\"Golden Slumbers\\" points back to \\"You Never Give Me Your Money,\\" so much so that Paul brings that theme back, and it fits beautifully in the midst of \\"Carry That Weight.\\" Brilliant. The music in \\"Carry That Weight\\" becomes stronger; the accents are very deliberate and on every beat (1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4), which fits the idea of being strong and carrying that weight. During \\"The End,\\" George, Paul and John trade guitar solos. This is the perfect buildup to the end, where the orchestra returns and beautifully resolves all that precedes with a certain finality. And that's why \\"Her Majesty\\" works so well at the very end: its placement is sort of tongue-in-cheek and it was left unresolved; it cuts off like the end of the LP's side one.<br />Years later, \\"Abbey Road\\" still resides in my top ten rock albums of all time. If this one sounds more \\"cohesive\\" than the \\"White Album,\\" I think it's for two main reasons: (1) Everyone sort of rallied behind it; they wanted to make one more good one; and, most importantly, (2) George Martin was actually allowed to work his miracles - something he was allowed to do only in part on the \\"White Album.\\"<br />Cheers,<br />Murraylast sing \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\"?

B00006IUL7|5.0|The DVD format has been out for several years now, and it seems studios are finally paying attention to the transfer to DVD.  I believe this is because of the growing number of people who are buying HDTVs and expecting their source material to approach the quality of the HDTV signal.  Unfortunately, this is not really possible, but the Insomnia DVD does approach this nirvana.  There are very few MPEG decoding artifacts, and edge enhancement is almost nonexistent.  The cinematography captures the beauty of our nation's largest state, Alaska, and will make you want to visit.  Definite reference-quality material.<br />The cast performs well, and tension between the psychopathic killer (played by Robin Williams) and the cop with a dubious past (Al Pacino) mounts to an incredible climax.  You will need to watch this movie more than once in order to get the subtleties of the story.  Highly recommended!
B00002MZ2C|3.0|After all the hype surrounding the album...<BR>After the album going multiplatinum...<BR>After releasing two incredible singles and one okay one...<BR>I finally decided to get it. I love \\"Sleep Now In The Fire,\\" a rocking, fast-paced tune with a good message, excellent guitar, and nice rapping. I also think \\"Guerrilla Radio,\\" with its cool lyrics and awesome 'Guitarmonica' solo, is a cool track. \\"Testify,\\" a remotely heavy song, also caught my attention. \\"Born Of A Broken Man\\" is also worth a mention, and I can dig the high-pitched squeal of \\"Ashes In The Fall.\\" Here's the catch...those are the only standouts on the whole CD! All the other songs are not that great. I anticipated getting this album for a long time, and was terribly disappointed. Many of the songs are close to becoming totally rap. RATM have always been able to straddle the border. This album is a heavy lean to the rap side. Listen to those songs I mentioned, because I think they're the only good ones. I give it three stars-One for each good song, minus two for repetitiveness and boring execution(so much rap!!!). Other RATM albums are better. Evil Empire and the s/t beat this by a mile. Go with those. Audioslave better make up for this. I surely hope so.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This is a classic kid movie.  Besides being nominated for oscars, this movie also contains a lot of bonus features in two dvds.  It contains games such as PEEK-A-Boo , deleted scenes, the making of the movie, the oscar winning short film For The Birds, a new short film about the characters from the movie called Mikes New Car, and much more.  All dvds have the widescreen and fullscreen versions on them.  It even comes with hilareous outakes.  In other words these two disks are fun and full of things to do for hours.  SO i highly recommend it especailly if you have kids.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|With each additional album Cash has done on the American record label, he keeps outdoing himself!  Just when I thought his last album, Solitary Man was his best of these albums, I find out he can go beyond that too.  What is especially amazing about his cover songs is that he can make them completely his own.  His cover of Trent Reznor's (Nine Inch Nails) song &quot;Hurt&quot; is certainly an unusual choice, yet he's able to make even this song as if he wrote it himself - the words carry more experiential weight to them, and the song is really terrifying how he does it.  There are many other great songs on this album, covers as well as originals, filled with much emotional depth.  The &quot;American Series&quot; is really wonderful songs that transcend categories of country &amp; western, rock, pop or whatever.  Anyone who is simply a music lover should own this album, as well as the other four albums of the American recordings of Johnny Cash.
6304708491|5.0|An excellent extended music video featuring &quot;The Beatles&quot;<BR>The music is great if you are a fan. I am waiting for an up to date (restored) dvd with a Criterion type treatment. I love this movie it is of my generation and will always be a positive visit to my past. Good luck to the present generation revisiting Rap Videos when they are seniors. Will they let their grandkids watch that mindless &quot;porn for kiddies&quot; like MTV shows continually?
B00006NSZ5|3.0|My man Em is back in da house wit' a soundtrack guaranteed to get ya' jumpin'!!  I don't believe I've yet heard a soundtrack where, from top to bottom, the whole thing rox - 'cept maybe that Brady Bunch soundtrack from a few yearz back, when all da top grunge masterz contributed.  <br />Em's lyrics are a bit more heartfelt and personal on this one, as he pries away his layerz and showz us what's inside.  All you Moby hataz may want to find another Em record if you want to hear him dissed again, cuz this time 'round, Em is more interested in rapping from da heart, just like Kool Mo Dee and LL Cool J from dayz of yor.  <br />No one shakes up the scene like Em, and I gotta' feeling my boy is gonna' be standin' next to Denzel at the next Emmy awardz show, as he grabz his trophy for best actor of da millenium!!  (Yep, he'z that great of an actor.)<br />My only gripe with Em is his sometimez sleazy lyrics and persona, but like I said, he cleanz up his act for da kidz on this one (for the most part).  <br />ENJOY IT, MY HOMIEZ!!  PEACE FROM DA EAST!!
B00005JKNF|5.0|This film is a period masterpiece.  Altman has captured aristocratic England of the 1930's perfectly.  In a fashion similar to \\"Titanic,\\" the creators of this film wanted to \\"get it right,\\" and conducted extensive research on the etiquette of the period.  Ancient butlers, maids, and footmen were enlisted to share their memories, coach the actors, and ensure that the film reflected the reality of the era. Period wallpaper was recreated.  Authentic locations were employed.<br />The special features included on the DVD are stellar; there are two separate commentaries, one by Robert Altman and one by Julian Fellows, the screenwriter-  both worth listening to. The dialogue is a bit hard to catch at times.  One solution: turn on the English subtitles.  This can help the American ear that is not tuned to British inflection.<br />This is a film you can watch again and again, and you will catch new subtleties each time.  The ensemble cast shines.  The connections between those who serve and those served are intricate on many levels (physical, sensual, spiritual...).  A few stand-outs: Maggie Smith, at her Bette-Davis-acerbic finest; Jeremy Northam, who plays the fading (real) film star Ivor Novello, and does a wonderful job singing period songs; the delightful Emily Watson; Helen Mirrin, in an understated, subtle performance as the housekeeper; Alan Bates as the alcoholic butler; Clive Owen as a valet with a secret.<br />If you get a warm spot in your heart when you think of Brideshead Revisited, Howards End, and other period pieces, this is a film for you.  If you love superb acting at its finest, and the art of filmmaking, buy this DVD.  You will find a superior film plus a world of bonus material.  Enjoy!
0739301985|5.0|I read &quot;The Partners&quot; and this one is totally different from Grisham's other lawyer stories.  This one has a funny touch to it.  I love it.
B000063JZQ|5.0|Purists beware, Roman Polanski and Kenneth Tynan have cut, rearranged, and shaped Shakespeare's material to make a MOVIE!  And what a grand film they created.  Flowingly cinematic, with stunning location filming and superb cinematography the many cuts allow for a smooth narration without sacrificing the gut and heart of the play.<br /><br />There was much controversy when this film debuted, probably due to it being financed and produced by Hugh Hefner and Playboy, and probably because it was unblinkingly bloody upfront (although the blood is in the play, much of it is naturally offstage), and because of nudity in several key scenes (including the witches....all those old nude crones, while factually correct, no doubt upset many).  Today, these seem like perfectly reasonable choices.  The film is relentless and remorseless, as befits the story.  I don't know what part of Polanski's personal tragedy had any part in his work here, but the direction is excellent.  Finch and Anis are fine as the murderous Laird and his Lady, as is the rest of the cast.<br /><br />If you want the play, see the play.  If you want a stimulating and fully realized CINEMATIC treatment of Shakespeare's great themes of greed, ambition, murder, guilt and destiny, see this finely produced, directed, and acted work.  Well worthwhile.
B000001FTJ|5.0|I have arrived at Tom Waites at the age of 52, and find myself wondering why the hell I never discovered his music before. This is not for the timid, it's a mixture of primal and raw music. It<BR>is jarring, discordant, grainy and addicting. There is more than a hint of Kurt Weill to the whole album, and the ensuing mixture strikes a chord that sets my own soul buzzing with sympathetic vibrations. I think you have to have a dark and twisted streak to appreciate this album. You have to know the taste of too many cigarettes, the pounding of Scotch induced hangovers, and the scent of cheap perfume on a cold, empty pillow. I love it..................
B00003CXI0|1.0|I read the book 2 years before the movie came out. I fell in love with the Harry Potter books. I heard they were coming out with a movie and I thought it would be interesting. I was wrong. They did a good job with casting. I thought they found the perfect Dumbledore! The movie was not at all what I thought it would be. They cut out the schene at the end with the purple fire. With all of the technology today, they could' ve done it and only added 2 mins. to the movie. I'm sure that they'll destroy Chamber of Secrets which was my favorite book. People who have never read the book but seen the movie, the book was over 100 times better.
0446608955|5.0|This book was fantasticly superb. It's touching, sad, romantic and sweet. Every moment and scene that goes on within this story with &quot;Jamie,&quot; the shy daughter of a strict minister and &quot;Landon,&quot; the so-called &quot;bad popular guy&quot; at school will touch you straight to the heart with heartfelt sorrows. It's a story about true love that you won't ever forget. I really like the way Nicholas Sparks (the author) knows how to get your attention, having you in tears in no time. This is a must read book!
0783225970|1.0|First of all, to clear up a misconception that has been that copies of this DVD have the cover on it but have a bootleg DVD inside are incorrect.  This is the DVD, but it is out of print for a reason.  It is out of print because it is the absolute ugliest, most disgusting defacement of a film DVD has ever done to a movie.  The transfer was ported from the collector's edition laserdisc quickly and hastily, without anamorphic enhancement or anything.  The end result, the picture LOOKS like a bootleg, a crummy DIVX file someone ripped on their own.  This went down in history as an all time low for DVD, so this is why the DVD is no longer available, and why the new version of the DVD is currently in the works of being made.<br />Anyhow, I've reviewed the film before, but needed to say this again about the DVD for anyone that thinks they're getting a bootleg.  Believe me, there's a reason you can't get this DVD anymore.
6305313687|4.0|This was a good movie, no doubt. It shows the dangers of racism, and that a child is a product of their parents. Teach a child to be tolerant and they will be tolerant. Teach your kid to be homophobic and racist, and they will be homophobic and racist. <br />Even though this is good, I think this is a tad one sided in a way. To be honest, skinheads and KKK members are a drop in the bucket when it comes to our crime rate. Minorities target whites because they are white, yet you don't hear that as a hate crime on TV, do you? Black racists, like Al Sharpton and Louis Farakkhan are more dangerous than some poor, white racist. Why? Because black racists have the NAACP protection, ACLU protection, the federal government, and the resources to get away with it.<br />I'm not saying that people like skinheads represented in this movie aren't dangerous. I just think the white on black crimes are so isolated and rare that it's pointless to even worry about. What about the fact that blacks commit more crimes against themselves, than some young skinhead punks would?<br />I do find it unbelievable that Edward Norton, a hateful racist, would suddenly denounce his white supremacist views, simply because he worked next to a guy in prison.  I mean, what is the percent chance that Jerry Falwell will over come his anti-gay bigotry?  You can show racists and homophobes all the sources to prove them wrong, that the people the hate are no different than them, but bigots will be bigots.  This movie was a little too wishful thinking, in my opinion.<br />I will say I like the movie, howeveer, because it shows the race issue from each side. The blacks feel they are profiled a lot, while the white gang feels the backbone of reverse racism, and affirmative action. You get the race issue for the Generation X persepective.
B00006V9A0|1.0|If you havent heard of nirvana by now, you shouldnt even be reading this. If you have, you probly would have bought one of their albums by now, assuming you liked what you heard. This, however, is a silly purchase. One new song... one...which im sure you can find on the internet. Its a mockery to nirvana and is really just a money scheme for the record company. Nirvana would NEVER release this in their right mind. So if you like nirvana and support what they stood for then dont buy this album, nirvana isnt getting a penny for it....plus the track listing really stinks...
B000062XGG|1.0|I, of course rather naively, went into this film in the understanding that this was an 'aliens attack the world and are repelled' sci fi romp. I was sorely misguided. Of course it is America who is attacked by nasty ET and subsequently has to save the world(again). The Devlin/ Emmerich duo(yes I hear you cry, they of Godzilla fame) apparantly believe America alone is capable of coming up with the veritable genius of an idea to steal an alien spaceship, fly a wisecracking military goofball and a typically dour scientist/Goldblum persona..., accompanied by an action packed fighter/alien dogfight, featuring world leaders and drunk crop dusters. Such efforts are met with worldwide celebration of American genius, accompanied by the obligatory hackneyed stereotypes. Note to director- Im sure not all Brits use the word 'bloody' six times per sentence. All in all a overblown piece of mastabatory flag waving, destined nevertheless to reap the benefits of a largely ignorant public. Unfortunately this type of thing seems to pervade Hollywood these days, and i kinda blame myself for putting trust in the film industry. I'll try and forget the whole sorry business and get on with my life.
B00006FXB6|5.0|This CD made me forget about \\"bands\\" like Puddle of Mud (sic) and Hoobastank and Creed.  When I listened to it for the first time, I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  I honestly thought there would never be a Zepplin/Soundgarden caliber band ever again, and I had no hope.  But this record plays like a thunderstorm in a desert.  Homme's & Oliveri's layers of the guitar and bass are violent, exquisite, and tightly formed.  Grohl rocks me as a drummer (he's like the king of change ups and he is arguably the most capable musician around).  The lyrics re-invent \\"positive negativity\\" (genuine social concern as opposed to \\"my girlfriend is mean to me\\") and put a message fourth on a music medium of smooth, mellow heat.  The end result is a shotgun crack right through the middle of mainstream silence.  OK - maybe I'm getting too esoteric for a music review. Just get the album and give it a crack.

B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been an Incubus fan for quite a while now, and this CD just blew me away. The more I listened to it, the more I liked every single track on this disc. This is a CD I can listen to at any time, and it always makes me feel good. It is one of the few CDs I still listen to after owning for a long time, on a regular basis. <br />My favourite song on the CD is Just a Phase - it sends shivers down my spine every time I listen to it, especially the beginning - I love this song. Another song I really love is the last one, Aqueous Transmissions. It is so relaxing... And one more favourite - Are You In? This song is awesome. I can't describe it, just listen to it, it's so great.<br />If I had a list of favourtie CDs, this would definately be near the top, if not at the very top. It's an amazing CD!
B00006399Z|5.0|Just bought my 5th copy of WTTC -- 3 LPs and 2 CDs. As a country dj, I discovered Traffic via the rhythmic Gimme Gimme Good Lovin'. Then found 40,000 Headmen on the flipside. Pure magic! A supergroup of prodigies infuse white man's music with African voodoo soul. Original, yet as old as Time. Musos usually give their best at such charity concerts -- here they carry the audience away with a generous display of virtuosity unhindered by the desire to show off. This is as close as one can get to the mesmerising power of an Osibisa live concert. Enjoy. This is the ultimate Desert Island Disc, and all the better for remastering.
014028009X|3.0|Bridget did in fact leave me laughing out loud a few times, however I felt a slight bit of disappointment throughout the book.<br />I don't see women as being overly neurotic, overly sensitive, waiting to get married freaks.  I CAN'T STAND the fact that she is weighing herself sometimes four or five times daily.  After the first fifty pages I decided to skip the weigh in notes.  <br />I see a lot of women on here saying that this is just how they think.  I feel sorry for you.  Looks and \\"partners\\" are important, however they shouldn't rule your life to no end.  I am a strong believer that women are a lot different than Bridget.  We are strong, beautiful in our own ways and can deal without a man! <br />Three stars because at sometimes it is unbelievably funny :)
B00006LPIV|3.0|Yikes. Where do I begin? Usually, I love watching foreign films, because they tend to rely more on telling a good story rather than special effects and big names. But I'm sorry to have to say that I was very disappointed with this one. \\"The Piano Teacher\\" revolves around a sexually repressed piano teacher who never smiles, and who is very icy with everyone, including a young man who, for some odd reason, claims to love her. She still lives with her nosy, sometimes intolerable mother in a small apartment, and sometimes you get the impression they hate each other. This woman also likes to go to porn shops to watch porn videos, and she likes to watch young couples getting hot-and-heavy at drive-in movies. A lot of this film's content is racy... Even though some scenes are, well, deserving of being un-rated, they are not done pornographically. After all, this is an artsy French film. It wasn't so much the racy content that bothered me, but more of how it was executed. By the end of the film, I was frustrated. The piano teacher treats this young man horribly, and freaks him out when she gives him a list of violent things she wants him to do to her doing sex. He, of course, isn't amused by this, but I spent the entire film wondering why he even loved her in the first place.<br />I kind of wanted to give this film one star, because I found a lot of it to be very disturbing. However, I can't because the movie is not a bad movie. The acting is superb, and the story, though not my cup of tea, is still a powerful, tragic story of a woman with some real problems. And of course, the music is great. So while it is not for everyone, it is an okay foreign film, so long as you're not looking for a feel-good one.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Thsi album is amazing! Dont let dirty mislead you this album i snoting like dirty! She tuouches on every subject, wrote all but 2 songs ont he album! Her writing talent is up there with alicia keys, her vocal talent is uncomparable! She has proven herself trhoughout this album that she is a true artist! And that she is here to stay!
6305426694|4.0|This book focuses on a narrow slice of the history of the problem in Woburn. <br />The introduction of this book also destroyed lives of which the general public is unfamiliar. One such life is Ken Grant, a former Grace employee charged with protecting the general public in the aftermath of Grace's controversial environmental history.<br />Grant worked as a safety &amp; environmental professional who had worked for a couple of divisions of Grace. Grant was an active volunteer in many charities in Massachusetts and grew up as anunwanted youngster in state child care. As a young child Grant was crippled,abandoned and abused.<br />Grant lived in Woburn a number of years and in most all the neighborhoods where the earliest cases of leukemia arose, was treated at the same hospitals as those children and also appeared in court.<br />When this book came out, his medical records suddenly became unavailable, he was rousted from Grace and unable to get good references from Grace despite years of solid service. A long strong of strange events unfolded in which he began to research his hidden past and he was eventually driven into long term unemployment,bankruptcy and homelessness because no one would hire him in Massachusetts. All of this unfolded in the face of the fact that Grant was too young when the leukemia epidemic arose to know what was going on and was shuffled around so often as to keep his equilibrium off balance.As a child Grant was hospitalized long term and shuffled about.As an adult Grant was prevented from finding viable career stability. Amongst all this, no one involved with the book or movie spoke with him.
B00001OH7N|5.0|...and I find it amusing to read the reviews of people who claim to. It's a wonderful album/CD however. My favorite after Hunky Dory. There is a heavier guitar edge to many of the songs, and Mick Ronson sounds conspicuously like Jimi Page on a few tracks. Favorites are &quot;All The Madmen&quot;, &quot;Black Country Rock&quot;, and the albums' namesake, a haunting existential gem. This is deep album, one you can listen to for along time: the layers keep peeling off.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is more complex than it seems when you first pop it into your CD player.  The way the music just melds together so beautifully that you forget what track you're listening to.  Fight Test is a great opener.  It sets the tone of the whole robot battle which really gets going on the title track.  It's Summertime is a song I didn't like at first, but after the second listen I just couldn't get enough of it.  It's so uplifting and mesmerizing.  Excellent.<br />I've never heard music like this before.  I saw it on a listmania list and I thought I'd check it out because of the cover, but the music speaks for itself.  Buy it now, and don't compare albums to other albums or artists because it ruins the experience.  This is without a doubt the best album of the year,-although I haven't tried out some of the other things on that list yet, hmm, but I will!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This CD just doesn't leave my CD changer, and I've  listened to and played many different styles of music over the years - rock, blues, classical, metal, jazz, etc. The overall sound and style of music on this CD are difficult to try and pigeonhole, so why bother. This music transcends categorization. Instead, it delivers the ability to simply overwhelm with melody, emotion and enjoyment. Billy Corgan's musical genious is very much on display here; I can't help but think John Lennon and Jimi Hendrix would both nod happily in agreement. Corgan was, and is one of contemporary music's most prolific songwriters, and he certainly nailed it with this one.<BR> Mellon Collie can also easily be considered a masterpiece as well; however, Siamese Dream has a mesmerizing quality to it that just doesn't seem to wear out. A true musical gem.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Well, I would have to say, this is not as good as I would have expected. After listening to &quot;Curb&quot; and &quot;The State&quot;, it just seemed a bit to commercial. But, back with the good thoughts, this album deserves to be in every rock lovers sound system. From Chad's beautiful vocals, to Nik's pounding drums, this CD is brillient. some of the stand outs, (other than the 2 singles) are &quot;Where Do I Hide?&quot; yet another of the songs based on a true event, &quot;Woke Up This Morning&quot; (about Chad and Mikes Grandmother, among other things), and &quot;Good Times Gone&quot;. GTG is a bit on the softer side, contrary to other Nickelback, but, is a lovely song nonetheless. From &quot;Never Again&quot; to Good Times Gone&quot;, this is a bloody good album. Now go out and buy it :-D<br />Blessed be,<BR>Ashlii
0739301985|4.0|Skipping Christmas tells the story of a couple who decides to boycott the expense and hassle of Christmas. By their calculations, taking a ten-day Caribbean cruise over Christmas will actually save them money! They quick learn that skipping this monumental holiday is easier said than done.<br />Skipping Christmas expresses so well what many of us feel around the holidays -- frustration, hassle, worry, not to mention the strained pocketbooks. Grisham has done a fantastic job of keeping the story light and simple, and at the same time entertaining and humorous. It is the perfect book to help get you through the stress of the holidays!
B00005JKCH|5.0|The biggest hit of the year is now available on DVD.  Spiderman, I think, was one of the best films of 2002.  It had a good story, great acting, good special effects, and great action sequences.  I really enjoyed this movie.  I had a smile on my face all the way through it.  It's big and it's fun.  The DVD is also quite good.  <br />Movie: Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is hopelessy in love with Mary Jane Watson (Kirstin Dunst).  Peter gets bitten by a genetic spider while on a field trip.  Suddenly, he is able to shoot out spiderwebs, and basically be a spider.  After the tragic death of his uncle, Peter decides to use his new powers to fight crime.  From then on, he becomes Spider Man.  But, he must also fight the Green Goblin (William Dafoe) in order to save those he loves.  A great action-adventure movie everyone will love.<br />DVD:<br />Video: The disc comes in a 1.85:1 widescreen transfer.  A Pan & Scan version is also available.  The image looks quite good, if not great.  There are a few flaws, and the picture can occassionally be a little bright.  All in all, pretty good picture quality.    (4.5/5)<br />Sound:  The movie comes with a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix.  I was hoping for a little more enveloping sound, but good overall.   (4.5/5)<br />Features:  There is an HBO making of, the evoltion of Spiderman, TV Spots, trailers, music videos, and much more.  Features are a little bit promotional, but interesting.   (4.5/5)<br />Overall: (4.7/5)  The 5 star rating is for the movie itself.
B000002ADT|5.0|If you have never understood what Miles Davis was about, this album will explain it easily. Miles believed in the KISS rule. Keep It Simple Stupid! While many artists were trying to squeeze a million notes into a measure, Miles was trying to invest in his music more FEELING. For all its lack of up-tempos and drum fills, it still manages to come off as spontaneous AND cohesive. The sound of this recording is phenomenal. It was just a fluke that I bought it, but, Wow- what luck! You will wear this CD out.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Since I figure that everyone has already seen Harry Potter and formed their own opinions, I'm writing this review primarily on the DVD and the much touted extras.  The movie itself is wonderful - but the DVD set leaves a little to be desired.  The first DVD in the set is great.  They did a first rate job on the transfer and the sound.  The second DVD with all the extras though is lacking a certain something.  <br />The extras disc has just enough to make you want more but doesn't have some of the very things that we all heard about during all the publicity about the film.  I remember hearing over and over that the first cut of the film came in at over 3 1/2 hours.  Then on the disc there are only a few deleted scenes totally under 10 minutes.  They had the obligatory making of but that too seemed more than a bit short.  Another frustrating thing was navigating the extras - it was close to impossible.  It took me over ten minutes to work through the little game system to even access the deleted scenes(though I later discovered there was a very small place to click for direct access).  This just wasn't fun.  I don't enjoy being made to jump through hoops to watch a film and see the various extras packaged in.  Maybe they should release one version for adults who don't like the games and another for children who enjoy things like that.<br />Overall I love the film but I have this feeling that they are holding back to release another set sometime.  It would be nice to just be able to purchase the film without having to wonder about another release coming out in a year.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Definetly the best movie of 2001.  The film is extravgant and outrageous.  It has a unique comic undertone and a brilliant plot.  Great DVD with loads of features.  Buy it and you will not regret it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Wonderful sweet music. We played it ten times in one relaxed eveing. Can't wait for her next offering.
B00006LJ6X|5.0|CHICAGO VII was originally released in March 1974, quickly hitting # 1 and eventually spawning three big hit singles.  Initially it was planned as a jazz record (hence the first 5 instrumental - and highly enjoyable - tracks) but with commercial concerns, they soon included a fresh selection of conventional pop tunes.  Of the hits, you'll find \\"I've Been Searchin' So Long\\", \\"Call On Me\\" and \\"Wishing You Were Here\\" (with three of The Beach Boys), however many of the highlights are the non-hits, such as \\"Happy Man\\" (which has lost its false start on the original album - the only negative thing about the re-issue), the jazz workouts \\"Aire\\" and \\"Devil's Sweet\\", \\"Song Of The Evergreens\\", \\"Byblos\\" (one of Terry Kath's finest moments) and Robert Lamm's \\"Skinny Boy\\" (with The Pointer Sisters on backups).  This was Chicago's last studio double album and their last truly experimental album - recorded at a time when they could do no wrong.  The ballads were starting to seep through more but thankfully, Chicago still were in a creatively ambitious mood.  It is not a surprise that CHICAGO VII is a personal favorite of many fans.  It's one of mine.  The Rhino re-issue itself is another great one and has faithfully restored the original artwork.  I just wish that \\"Happy Man\\" had been left in its original state, but that is a minor quibble in the face of a fine re-release.  One of 1974's most satisfying albums.
B000050IE6|5.0|Before I recommend this album, I suppose I should give a word of warning to Death Metal fans. Opeth is NOT the usual death Metal. If you plan on buying Still Life (or any other Opeth record) thinking its a normal standard death album, you will be disappointed - or maybe pleasantly surprised. Opeth is much, much more.<br />Still Life is a concept album, about a man who is banished from his village, only to return and find his lover already married.  The songs vary from extremely heavy riffs with superb death growls (such as on Godhead's Lament) to sweet acoustic melodies with clean vocals (Benighted).  That is to many people a surprise, since many cannot imagine death growls and clean vocals in the same song. Yet Opeth manage that, to create songs with an electrifying, and at times soothing, atmosphere. That said, the songs might take some getting used to, since the transition from heavy riffs to acoustic guitars (and vice versa) may be a surprise to some people. The cover art is pretty good and the booklet features lyrics to the songs as well as pictures of the band. The lyrics in my opinion are an excellent description of the feelings of the banished man, and are some of the best lyrics I have heard for a while.<br />A recommended buy for anyone who appreciates melodious art.
0316666343|4.0|...if she still had a book club. It has all the signatures of the books she chose, most of which I did enjoy, though I did come to understand that in picking up an Oprah book club selection, I was signing up for a particular kind of story--young female protagonist, heartbreaking violation of a childhood, ultimate triumph. This book did call me back to it whenever I put it down, and the first two thirds move quickly and compellingly. The last third, for me, meandered, and I began to feel impatient for the author to wrap things up. Don't want to give away the plot, so I can't really get in to my frustration with the final third, but overall, a beautifully written and hopeful view of our ability to survive the worst that can be leveled at us. Worth reading, I think, despite the flaws.
B000002H8F|5.0|When people ask me what my favorite CD is, I give them a different answer every month or so. If you asked today, I'd say the Doubble Donkey Disc by Ozma. This response is analogous to my response to what my favorite movie is. People always ask me that, and I always say something different. Sometimes it's Ferris Bueller's Day Off, sometimes its Fight Club, etc. The point is, in response to the movie question, The Empire Strikes Back is, and will probably always be, my favorite movie. It falls into a different category than 'other' movies. Bossanova is the same way. I always assume that people know Bossanova is the best ever, just as I assume people know that The Empire Strikes Back is the best ever. Anyway, except for &quot;Velouria&quot;, which by no means do I dislike, every song on this album is remarkably outstanding. &quot;The Happening&quot; starting at approximately 2 minutes and 45 seconds to the end is easily the finest section of any song, by any band, ever.

0316666343|3.0|The Lovely Bones is a creative exploration of the supernatural. The author weaves a story of love, tragedy and pain which traverses the vastness of heaven and earth.  A 14-year-old girl who is raped and dismembered by a serial killer narrates the story.  In heaven, Susie can see the impact her murder has on family and friends.  As a spectator and sometimes participant in earthly activities, she is able to maintain connected to the living in ways that most people on earth fail to notice.<br />Sebolds method of narration works wonderfully for the story. Although the narrator is fourteen years old, her age does not hamper her perception or her ability to interpret the humanity she sees on earth.  The heavenly perspective provided by the narrator lends credibility and allows her to transcend age constraints. Overall, I thought this a good read.  There were moments where the story moved slower than I liked, so I skipped a few paragraphs here or there to speed the pace (you dont lose any of the story line, some of the writing is rather fluffy).  I believe the mass appeal for this book is due primarily to the subject matter and readers desire to believe that those who we love maintain a mystical connection to us after they die.  Sebold portrays this connection is an easily accessible manner that validates experiences had by many survivors of the dead.  Worth reading and passing on.
B000001GH9|5.0|Anne-Sophie Mutter is one of the world's leading violinists, and this transcendent performance of the haunting Berg Violin Concerto shows why.  With a gorgeous tone, she is in total command of the score's many expressive details, while keeping an eye on the larger structure.  The overall impression is of quiet intimacy, even when the piece erupts into more blazing outbursts.  The Rihm &quot;Time Chant,&quot; written for Mutter, creates a vivid sound world and is also a fascinating complement to the Berg.  Rihm is one of the most interesting composers around, and this piece, also on the quiet side, is an excellent introduction to his work.<br />James Levine is outstanding with Berg, as his glowing performances of &quot;Wozzeck&quot; and &quot;Lulu&quot; have shown.  In his hands, this basically atonal score sounds more related to Richard Strauss or even Brahms.  The Chicago Symphony Orchestra plays with its typically high level of virtuosity (such pianissimos!) and the recording is clear and natural-sounding.<br />The Berg is fairly well-represented on CD, and while I also like Itzhak Perlman's version with Ozawa and the Boston Symphony, Mutter's is equally memorable and the Chicago recording has a slight edge over the other one.  If you are at all curious about the Rihm, this is well worth looking at.

B00004Z459|1.0|Did these guys actually think they could fool me? There tirade of electronic-wannabe rap-metal-and screaming songs were made to be liked by Limp Bizkit haters. So what is Fred Durst uses the F word from time to time, he revived rock to what it is and Linkin Park would still be called Hybrid Theory and would hold concerts in high school gyms if it weren't for Limp Bizkit. I see no point in these songs as they seem to have the same effect. DJ Joseph Hahn should find work elsewhere, Mike Shinoda's pathetic attempt to rap is overshadowed by Chester Bennington's unwillingness to stop screaming in his songs. As a fan of new era rock, I'd have to say Linkin Park are pure posers. They used the same tactics as Limp Bizkit did on The Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water by trying to get more teenage girls to buy their CD. Say what you wanna say about CSATHDFW, but at least Limp made 2 good CDs before that.<BR>Buy this if you wanna cry after every track.<BR>Buy Significant Other by Limp Bizkit if you want to be touched, taught a lesson in love, releave some stress, and have some fun.
0385503954|4.0|It's easy to see why this novel won the Booker Prize.  It is extremely well-written and it's hard to believe it's only some 350 pages or so.  The author delves into so much detail into the lives of Robbie, Cee and Bryony.  But, having said that, I read a book to be entertained.  I don't read a book to make me feel depressed, and that is how I felt at the end of the book.  This book is a tragedy - pure and simple.  It is a very well-done, and well-thought out tragedy, but a tragedy just the same.  I found I had to open one of my old standby's to get me in a better frame of mind after I finished the book.  That's why I didn't give the book 5 stars.  For writing, plot, characterization, it probably deserves 5 stars, but it left me too sad to give it 5.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash returns with another beautiful, sparse, haunting album.  As with everything since the terrific first &quot;American Recordings&quot; album, it's the small songs that are the most moving.  While &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; may get the most name recognition on this album, it's Cash's renderings of &quot;Danny Boy&quot; (just Cash's voice and a church organ), &quot;Desperado&quot;,  and his duet with Nick Cave on Hank Williams' &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; that really stand out.<br />But most of all, there are the opening and closing tracks.  The opening title song is based on the Book of Revelations and shows Cash's continuing strength in Gospel based songwriting.  The closing track will be familiar to fans of &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; - &quot;We'll meet again&quot;.  The last thirty seconds are worthy of being played and sung along with at full volume.
B00000JCB2|5.0|Talk about a group that turned a screaming hardcore metal album into a multi-platinum chartbuster into the revival of rock as we know it, you must be talking about Limp Bizkit.<BR>All these other bands can thank Limp for what they did, because now they use the same tactics Fred Durst did but for some reason they're good......<BR>The tracks on this CD will hit you hard if you like listening to what a guy with experience has to say. Re-Arranged is definately the best song on this CD. It starts off as a soft story about a broken relationship, then turns into a heavy metal outpour of emotion. The other song that hit me hard is No Sex......<BR>I can't name a track I didn't like on this CD. Buy it if you can find it.
B000056K04|1.0|I am a die-hard DMB fan. I never thought I would buy an album of theirs that I didn't love. BTCS took a while to grow on me, but I eventually loved it, just like all the previous offerings of Dave and Co. I was excited about Everday, and I bought it on the first day it was released. After listening to it only once, I tossed it back in the jewel case and never listened to it again (the radio stations played more than enough of it for my tastes). I felt let down, somehow, by this cd. Everything that I loved in a DMB cd seemed to be missing in this one (I have been known to jump up,dance, and sing at the top of my lungs to most DMB songs. This is particularly dangerous when I am driving). There was no passion in Everday. I don't feel inspired to boogie by this cd. My suspicions about the cd were confirmed when (on the same day) I heard Everday on a Soft Rock ... station, at the grocery store, and in an elevator.

B00004XOWM|3.0|Talk about a band that pretty much brought rock back into the music world that deemed it old and worthy, turned it into a new product, was loved by all, them stabbed in the back.<BR>Limp Bizkit is probably one of the more talented bands in the world. Their first CD gave them a hard-core metal reputation, then they came back with their best CD ever, Significant Other. Which mixed in everything LB had to offer and they did it with style. Now I'll be the first to admit that the songs on these track we made just to sell the album, but they're really not that bad at all.<BR>Hot Dog - Too much cussing, but awesome work by Rivers, Otto, and Borland<BR>My Generation - The song on the CD that will get you moshing your cd player in the middle of class<BR>My Way - Very good song<BR>Rollin - Too commerical<BR>Livin It Up - Best track on CD, best mix of rap and metal with good lyrics<BR>It'll be Ok - This song is just like the ones in Significant Other, nice and soft then gets hard during the chourous<BR>Boiler - Nice song, but too much drama<BR>Rollin (Urban Assault Vehicle) - The only Limp song I like that features rappers<br />All in all, its worth the 15 bucks but its not Limp's best work. The bass/guitar/drum work makes up for the sometimes shotty lyrics and bad DJing. I recommend this for anybody who likes the hard beats LB has to offer.<BR>P.S. Significant other was better than Hybrid Theory anyday.
0451167716|5.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo is about an Italian Mafia family, the Corleones, who live in New York, and it gives an inside look at how the Mafia runs.  The many characters include Don Vito Corleone, the Godfather, and his three sons, Santino, Fredo, and Michael.  The first main event happens when a man by the name of Virgil Sollozzo enters Don's office and asks if Don would help him import drugs into the United States.  Don rejects saying that even though the profits from drugs are high, so are the risks.  A couple days later, when Don is getting into his car, he is shot by two men.  Even though he is severely wounded he is not killed and Santino is forced to take over the business.  I won't give away the rest of the book, but I will tell you it kept me on the edge of my seat.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys nonstop action in the novels they read.  I found Mario Puzo's writing style to be very good with lots of unexpected twists and turns.  This helped make the book very exciting.  I also recommend it to anyone interested in the Mafia.  This book provides an inside look about how the Mafia is run.  Overall, I enjoyed this book very much.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|The horror action genre seems to invite mediocre sequels.  Film producers seem driven to repeat as much of the original film as possible, and most story lines are never all that rich in the first place.  So I picked up 'Blade II' as lark, not even positive that I would want to review it.  What I never expected was a sequel so good that it made 'Blade' look like it was just practice.<br />When the film opens, you discover that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) never really shot himself in 'Blade'.  Instead, he was captured by vampires and has been used as a mobile blood bottle for the past few years.  Our first sight of Blade (Wesley Snipes) is Whistler's rescue.  Leaving a trail of dusted vampires, Blade takes his old mentor back home and administers vampire anti-venom.  There we meet Blade's new partner, Scud (Norman Reedus), who alternates between getting stoned and keeping Blade's supply of technological tricks working.<br />What follows is a spectacular attack by a pair of vampire ninjas who bear a message from Damskinos (Thomas Kretschmann), an ancient master vampire.  Vampirish reapers are eating the bloodsuckers of Prague as a snack before starting on the humans, and Damaskinos offers Blade the help of his vampire SWAT team, led by daughter, Nyssa (Leonor Varela), if Blade will consent to clean up the mess.  Blade, attracted by the idea of using vampires to kill even worse vampires, agrees.  And with that, the good times begin to roll.<br />The story, by David Goyer, is completely engaging.  It is full of noir imagery, with an almost Machiavellian plot, pitting modern technology with constant reminders of how ancient the vampire world really is.  In addition to the story itself, this film sports some of the most exotic fight choreography and digital imagery I have seen in this genre.  Director Guillermo Del Toro spares little to create a world of comic book intensity that draws heavily on anime for it's visual style.  The intent was to outdo the original production without imitating it in the least.  And that is exactly what he does.<br />If you have seen Blade, you already know that Wesley Snipes is perfect as the human vampire hybrid of few words and many moves.  And Kristofferson is equally perfect as the gritty sidekick.  Leonor Varela turns in a surprisingly good performance as the beautiful and deadly Nyssa.  And then there is Goss, and Kretschmann and Perlman and...  In fact, I could write several paragraphs of congratulatory praise for the entire cast, who were exceptional.  And then another for the music, the makeup, and the special effects.<br />If that is not enough, this two disk set contains enough 'making of...' and commentary material to make it a complete course in how to create a great horror action film.  Del Toro not only likes to talk about the hows and whys of this film, he does a very entertaining and thoughtful job of it.  Watching this was pure spooky fun and I heartily recommend it.ion without imitating it in the least.

B00005JKCH|4.0|I thought the movie was great onscreen and now on TV Screen. Yet I got to wonder with all the hype and all the money spent on this DVD set why they didn't work on a better Interface for the DVD Navigation (this includes the DVD-ROM as well). Even my friend said it was difficult to get around in it (so it is not me...and he buys a lot of DVD's) Small, hard to see icons to indicate where what you have selected and very non responsive (push the button five or six times and it might respond). The background commentary can be fascinating...though sometimes they fight for stuff to say. Would have liked if Toby had been part of it since he was involoved in a lot of the movie and could have gotten his perspecitve (he is the star after all). My roommate was a wrangler for the crowds and I learned a lot more from him about some of the stuff going on...so it was a bit more interesting what I got to see on the DVD. The second DVD is throwaway stuff for the most part...E-entrainment the making of (now that ought to be deep investigative reporting) and some screen tests and clothing shots (though finding out that the guy who does JJ is bald in real life was fun and great to see how he enhanced the character) So I would recomend getting the DVD don't let the interface ruin your movie going experience.

B000009QPE|5.0|I remember listening to this album for the first time in 1986 a few months or so after its release.  I thought \\"this is pure [bad]\\", except for the opening riff of \\"Jesus Saves\\".  I listened to it again on a long trip....still [bad].  I listened to again and again until I got it.  I wore the tape out.  I still stick it in the cd player every now and then and turn the dial to 10 and I am now an old man.  It is one of only 10 albums I would give a five star rating.  Lombardo was the most underrated drummer of all time, much better than all those who got all the accolades (Ulrich, Lee, etc.).  Put this one in your collection but never listen to it below 10.

B00005BCPC|5.0|MANSFIELD PARK is the third film adaptation, after PRIDE &amp; PREJUDICE and SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY, of a Jane Austen novel that I've been entreated to see by female acquaintances. Perhaps they're trying to refine my boorish character. Actually, while I've not read any of the Austen novels (nor do I intend to), I've enjoyed all three screen versions. There's hope for me yet, even at this late date.<br />This time around, our plucky heroine is Fannie Price, who, at the film's beginning at age 10, is sent by her parents from their flea-infested quayside hovel in Portsmouth to live with a pair of maternal aunts, Lady Bertram (Lindsay Duncan) and Mrs. Norris (Sheila Gish), at MANSFIELD PARK. Lady Bertram is married to the lord of the manor, Sir Thomas Bertram (Harold Pinter), and Mrs. Norris seems to be an integral part of Housekeeping. Fannie is to &quot;better herself&quot; among the family at the Great House, which includes Bertram's sons, Edmund (Jonny Lee Miller) and Tom (James Purefoy) and daughters, Julia (Victoria Hamilton) and Maria (Justine Waddell). Very soon the script jumps forward several years to 1806, and Fannie is now a young woman (played by Frances O'Conner). By this time also, Maria is engaged to a dull but congenial local chap, Mr. Rushworth (Hugh Bonneville).<br />Fannie is pretty much unimpressed by her residence among the landed gentry, and her wit, which she sometimes addresses to the camera (a nice touch to the film), is sharp. As she says of living at MANSFIELD PARK, &quot;Life seems nothing more than a quick succession of busy nothings.&quot; One day, these &quot;busy nothings&quot; turn steamier with the arrival of the Crawfords, a brother/sister act, Henry (Alessandro Nivola) and Mary (Embeth Davidtz), who are there to rent out a nearby cottage. The film's best scene is perhaps when the Crawfords are ushered into the parlor where Fannie and the Bertrams are gathered while Sir Thomas and Tom, Jr. are off on a jolly inspecting the family's plantation in Antigua. One could hear a pin drop as the lens focuses on the faces of Lady Bertram, Mrs. Norris, Julia and Maria as their eyes fasten on the Gorgeous Hunk Henry, and on Mary's as she scrutinizes young Edmund. The look each demonstrates is the same I might show when stumbling across an especially fine piece of steak at the meat counter. Very soon, emotions run high. Maria has the hots for Henry, but he's obsessed with Fannie, who continues in her long standing love of Edmund, who may or may not return the feeling but is momentarily distracted by the admiring flirtations of the alluring Mary. It's the usual Austen Regency soap opera with its attendant crises d'amour.<br />For me, the considerable appeal of MANSFIELD PARK lies somewhere between that of P&amp;P and S&amp;S, the former having the highest (because of a greater length that allowed for varied and fuller character development). The vulnerable yet strong-willed Price is wonderfully likable, especially when she (both as the 10-year old and the young adult) delivers her asides to the viewing audience with wry humor and a mischievous smile. And, unlike the other two Austen epics mentioned, MANSFIELD PARK has a truly sharp edge revolving around the enslaved Blacks on the Bertrams' Antiguan property. Fannie is cut by this one day when she discovers some eye-opening sketches made by the younger Tom of events back on the plantation. No scene of such intensity was ever part of the cinematic P&amp;P or S&amp;S, and it's startling because it's so unexpected. It's an effective counterpoint to the gentility of Fannie's present environment.<br />If I have it right, there are one or two more Austen novels on film, plus at least one by Charlotte Brontë, that I'm being pressured to view.

B000002TQB|4.0|Blur's third album Parklife is an undeniable ode to British music.  Taking parts from The Kinks, The Jam, Marc Bolan and quite liberally from David Bowie, the band had fashioned a very British pop record.  The first track and single is \\"Girls &amp; Boys\\" which recalls Bowie from his Thin White Duke era.  The title track has a Kinks sound with lead singer Damon Albarn singing is a heavy Cockney accent amid burlesque style horns.  \\"Jubilee\\" has such a Bowie sound that if you didn't know any better you'd think you were listening to a lost track from Aladdin Sane.  The best track on the album is \\"End Of The Century\\", which has a syrupy melody and first rate vocals.  Although Blur is heavily influenced in their music, they mold their derivative sounds together into something that sounds all their own.
B00005QZWI|5.0|What a superb album! Howard Shore manages to mix action and beauty together with this great compiliation of music from the first hit film in the trilogy.<br />Shore creates a strong theme for the movie, and its characters, and maintains this strength throughout. It's nice to see choral pieces finding their way into cinema soundtracks again, especially ones in the haunting Elvish language, which has resonances with Gaelic and Welsh dialects. They're barely noticeable in some tracks, but still add to the haunting and mystical atmosphere.<br />The best track? Probably \\"The Breaking of the Fellowship\\". It's an epic track, with sweeping violin strings and a perfectly conveyed sense of parting, seguing perfectly into Enya's \\"May it Be.\\"<br />I can only hope that Shore continues this with his \\"The Two Towers\\" soundtrack, out next month.

Everything from his movie hits, to 50s hits to 60s hits, Vegas era have been package, re-packaged and recycled to capitalize on his music.  Most fans of his music probably have Hound Dog on over a dozen different albums.  Now to coincide with the 25th anniversary of his death, RCA has release Elvis: 30 #1 Hits.  What makes this album a must purchase for any Elvis Presley fan is the brilliant job done on the remastering.  The songs have all had new life breathed into them.  The music seems fresh and new with a clarity never heard before on an Elvis Presley record.  Songs from the 50s like Heartbreak Hotel, Dont, All Shook Up & (Now & Then Theres) A Fool Such As I have a new found vitality that provides a glimpse to how powerful the songs must of felt like when they were original released.
B00006CXXU|5.0|OK here goes...I'll admit it...I was a card-carrying, dues-paying member of the We-Hate-Christina-Aguilera Club. I thought she was just another one of those ... teen acts with no talent. So I heard her sing \\"Beautiful\\" all live and acoustic-y on MTV and I found myself digging on it in spite of myself. So I bought the record. OH MY [goodness]!! So here goes...words I never thought I'd say: CHRISTINA ROCKS!! Now I have a pretty eclectic taste in music but I NEVER thought I'd be wowed by someone who was once considered a \\"pop princess.\\" I mean, Jane's Addiction, Tool, Pearl Jam, DMX and yes, Eminem, are among my favorite acts so this is not coming from someone who generally digs on the lighter side of pop. <BR>  Christina Aguilera is a talent; a huge, beautiful voice and, surprisingly, a mature and thoughtful artist. So I don't care who you are or what you normally listen to, if you like good music, BUY THIS RECORD, BUY THIS RECORD, BUY THIS RECORD!! Really!! You won't be disappointed, I promise, and this is coming from one of the most jaded, 25-year-old, music fans you'll ever meet in your life.  <BR>  My favorite highlights of the album are: \\"Fighter\\" (Dave Navarro on guitar, YAY!), \\"Beautiful,\\" \\"Make Over,\\" \\"Soar,\\" \\"I'm OK,\\" and \\"Singing My Song.\\" But really, all the tracks are awesome and for those of you who have only heard the single \\"Dirrty\\" it is so NOT indicative of the rest of the record. Which isn't to say I don't like the track, it's ... fun to get down to, but there's so many other facets to this record you really have to listen to the whole thing. <BR>  So in closing, I take back anything bad I ever had to say about this amazing artist and tell everyone to buy it and crank it up!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|everything you read about this is true...the problem i have is the damn subtitles won't go off during the intro to each part...i don't know if its my dvd player or the disc..once the intro is done then they go off...annoying as hell...
B00005QG9J|5.0|After a couple low-profile albums Incubus hit the charts with blaster track \\"Pardon Me\\" and the acoustic driven \\"Drive\\" that headlined their acclaimed record \\"Make Yourself.\\" But Incubus didn't stop there. They put their heads together and created one of the greatest albums ever. Morning View from beginning to end is by far one of the most musically talented and well put together albums of the 00's. It starts out with the song \\"Nice To Know You\\" fading in with a queit riff on the guitar while singer Brandon Boyd has a face off with DJ Kilmore then busts into a pounding rock tune pulsating with great vocals and cringing guitars. The albums ends with the oriental influenced song Aqueous Transmittion that puts your mind at ease. Morning View is packed full of some of the best songs Incubus has ever created. Songs like digestable \\"Wish You Were Here\\" the echoing \\"Just A Phase\\" the soothing \\"Mexico\\" and the enticing \\"Warning.\\" But not mentioning the other songs is discrediting to the album. Every song on this album will blow your mind. It's the perfect blend of Jose Pasillas II's driving drums, Dirk Lance's funk influenced bass, DJ Kilmore's blend of turn tables, Mike Einziger's distinctivly crafted guitar riffs and Brandon Boyd's powerful and rich vocals. 9/10 Highlights: \\"Wish You Were Here\\" \\"Warning\\" Mexico\\" \\"Nice To Know You\\" \\"Auqeous Transmittion\\"

B0000039QA|4.0|At over 10 million copies sold, \\"Life After Death\\" is biggest selling rap album ever. Christopher Wallace A.K.A. The Notorious B.I.G. was killed on March 9, 1997 about three weeks before this album was released. Biggie definitely didn't leave people hanging with his posthumously released second album. This album contains such #1 hits as \\"Hypnotize\\", \\"Mo' Money, Mo' Problems\\", and \\"Sky's the Limit\\". Besides those three tracks, some more of my favorites are \\"[...]You Tonight\\" which features R. Kelly, \\"Nasty Boy\\", and \\"Playa Hater\\" from the second disc. However, Biggie only gets a four from me because of the immense length of this album (24 tracks and a staggering 109 minutes long!)
