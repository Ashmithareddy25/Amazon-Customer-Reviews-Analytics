B0015AARJI|5.0|I had a PS2 and loved the original dualshock controller.  For me, some games on the PS3 just didn't feel right without the rumble.  This is a bit heavier than the Sixaxis Controller but it is not noticable during game play.  The weight is actually better, and I'm glad the shock is back!
B0013UIUBC|2.0|With such a good cast, I expected a knock out, romantic comedy. Turned out to be a depressing movie with some light heartedness, humor and romance.  Don't be fooled by the cast or reviews. That seen where she slams the raw steak on the customers table, is actually part of the ending.    2 Thumbs down!
B00005JPS7|5.0|So many folks are doubting Downey's ability to pull off \\"superhero\\".   Well, now hopefully all doubts are allayed.  The movie was spectacular.  Not just in comparison to this year's meager pickings; but Iron Man stands on its own legs.  (quite literally)  This movie is not just another superhero-comic book rip off.   It's writing at its best.       Ok...so it had cool gadgets; great cars; funny jokes and a  formulaic plot line---but don't let that deter you.   This flick was worth more than the price of three admissions.       In  a nutshell, this film had everything for all people.  If you read just a bit between the sheets; the antiwar anti bureaucracy undertones satisfy even the most left wing of liberals.    The rah rah Americanism will please the hard line neo-cons and the gadgets and firestorm Fx will appeal to geeks and kids alike.     Best of all, this movie had heart.  If you weren't already a Downey fan, you probably were by the time you left the theatre.  Robert Downey Jr. seems the embodiment of Tony Stark as  every man's superhero.  Downey/Stark represents the dichotomy that lives inside of each of us.  Both playboy and public servant, you couldn't help but love and pity and relate to him, all at the same time.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This was a big surprise for me. At first I wasn't too interested but after seeing the trailer and reading the good reviews I got interested and went to see it. Robert Downey Junior is excellent. The movie isn't just your typical superhero movie, I thought it was a little fresh. The action scenes and special effects were great. Better than Spider-Man 2&3 but probably not as good as Batman Begins.
B000R4SMCW|1.0|\\"Fracture\\" is the kind of movie you watch when you've become resigned to merely being entertained, and even then only require a little bit of motion on the screen to capture and keep your attention for the agonizing two hours of this film.<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is almost decent as a DA who is trying to be too many things at once: really macho (he does some chin ups on a bar), a lawyer (he's terrible in court), charming (he smiles at a few women once in awhile), etc.  At no point does his character cohere into anything believable or<br />interesting.  He's just there and actually doesn't talk that much.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins is good, as always, playing a creepy old brilliant nut who kills his promiscuous wife and calculatingly removes any evidence linking him to the murder.  Unfortunately there isn't much to work with because he has very few scenes in which the director allows him to talk.  Everybody sort of stands there and nods.<br /><br />My disgust with the film grew to such a ferocious pitch that I began to enjoy Hopkins' tooling around with Gosling's colorless character.  His wife, who spends most of the movie in a vegetative state, is more enthralling than the people who are conscious and walking around.<br /><br />Maybe this is a real thrill for those in law school, but for my part I can't imagine why a director would take two tremendous actors and waste them so badly.<br /><br />Zzzz...
B000002LBH|5.0|This was my first Smiths album, an embarrassment of riches.  It has 24 tracks on it, and there really isn't one in the batch that reeks.  In fact, can I say that they are all brilliant?  Can I say that I really dig The Smiths?  Yes.<br /><br />The Smiths were one of the best bands of the 1980's, and none of their music has dated.  Whenever I listen to it, I don't think \\"80's Smiths\\", I just think it's brilliant, timeless music.  Many of these songs show off Morrissey's brilliant, sardonic wit, something that many critics of this band miss, and Johnny Marr's amazing melodies.  They call the lyrics whiny and they called Saint Morrissey a p***y, but he's the furthest thing from a whiny you-know-what.  I think many are just jealous of his enormous talent.  There's a lot going on in between the lines.  The more I listen to any Smiths music, the better it gets.<br /><br />Louder than Bombs has some of the best Smiths songs EVER.  Is It Really So Strange? is a pop masterpiece.  I adore Panic with its brilliant and stunning chours \\"hang the DJ\\" and the line \\"the music that they play/it says nothing to me about my life\\".  Most of the stuff I heard when growing up never said nothing about my life, and it's nice to hear someone saying it so beautifully.  I love the prickly, hilarious William, It Was Really Nothing.  And Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now is a great, great song.  I agree with Morrissey on \\"why should we give valuable time to people who don't care whether we live or die\\".  The Smiths's music was always universal.  It doesn't belong to any time frame.  100 years from now, this stuff will still be awesome.
B000SFJWLU|4.0|If you like metal, nu metal, death metal you will probably like this band.   I prefer the more melodic metal bands and Five Finger Death Punch hits the spot.   I liken this band to Killswitch Engage and Mudvayne where I can get some great thrashing metal, but with interludes of actual singing and melody.  After a while; constant prolonged growling gets boring especially since so many death metal bands insist on doing that---constantly.       Five Finger Death Punch mixes it up a bit.   And \\"The Bleeding\\"; well this song is one of those songs you can put on replay for 50  times and never get sick of.    The opening guitar gets me EVERY time.  In fact I looked for the sheet music to try and play it but it wasn't out there yet.      ----so after listening to this album for a few months, I have to say I am completely hooked and a bigger fan now than I ever was.       I really like the two add on songs, \\"Never Enough and \\"Stranger than Fiction\\"   What I love about \\"Stranger..\\" is the stark tempo changes, this is very appealing to me and a big audience pleaser.   I think this song has the potential to reach broader audiences who can then see how terrific this band really is.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've always been a fan of U2 but recently my renewed commitment to my faith has awakened me to the meaning of the words of many of these songs. I suppose a lot of people don't see Bono as a man of religous faith. To these folks I say read your Bible and listen to U2 again.
0312379293|5.0|Here's a book that proves there is good reason Mr. Archer is Great Britain's best selling novelist.  What good can come when a Cockney lad shares a pint with his fiance and his best friend in the wrong (posh) end of London inside a pub full of drunken gentry?  A few sodden comments, a leer here and there, and his friend lies dead outside the drinking establishment. With enough money, one can avoid the consequences of sin in any court.  With power, pounds, and position, the three guilty \\"gentlemen\\" can manuever through the English courts with relative ease. The innocent \\"Danny\\" loses his lover, his unborn child, and 20+ years of his life.  But, education can find its way even through locked cells, if one seeks it.  In prison Danny is tutored by a genteel man whose own world has been rocked.  Danny becomes a student of protocol.  He is taught to dress like, talk like, and becomes even more of a look-a-like of his new friend and mentor. Suddenly, during a prison riot, Danny's soon to be released friend is killed. Fortuitously, (and because it makes for a great story!), Danny is mistakenly identified as his teacher, and summarily released from prison.  It this was a great story before, and it was, PRISONER OF BIRTH now goes to max power and soars. Danny, becomes his friend.  With all the accoutrements of fortune, and the new faculty of mind and body to right quite a number of wrongs. The first of whom will be each of the dandies who conspired to admit him to a generation of confinement.  Vengence may be the Lord's, but the Almighy likely could not have done a better job of bringing the \\"olde public school tie boys\\" to their days of judgment. And, then there is the final twist. Of course, Danny is found out, and naturally he loses all that he gains; because, in the end justice must prevail.  Or, must it?  And, after all justice isn't always what comes out of a courtroom. Sometimes, \\"One good act of vengeance deserves another.\\"  This is an extremely entertaining read.  Buy it.  Buy two, in the event your spouse begins PRISONER and takes yours from you...

0765357151|4.0|\\"I am legend\\" is only about 150 pages or so (I guess not quite long enought to be a book on its own).  Some of the stories are a bit short and unusual, some I recognized as episodes of \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" or other TV shows.  Overall a good read.
B000N6TYLW|3.0|There is a marked difference from this season to the previous seasons as the original creator was no longer working on the show, but it's still funny. This season just lost a little of the original charm. I'm also sorry that it was cancelled this season since there's no real resolution and true Gilmore fans will miss seeing the ending that Amy Sherman-Pallidino already wrote. One great thing about this final season is that they provided some good special features. I recall one of the seasons didn't have any and that was disappointing, so I'm glad to have them again for the final season.
0743496736|5.0|Jodi tackles a modern controversy surrounding school shootings and the effects they have on the community.  It also explores the dire consequences of bullying and the social stigmas of adolescence.  When Peter opens fire in his high school, killing ten people and injuring dozens of others, the trauma takes its toll on everyone involved.  The book alternates between the current turmoil and Peter's past, from his disastrous first day of kindergarten, through elementary school and high school, reflecting how an ordinary boy can turn into a vicious killer.  From the nineteen minutes it takes to complete his rampage, through the investigation and trial, this book offers everything Picoult fans love about her, including a dramatic and stunning twist ending.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|This was the first album that I ever bought from Van Halen as a kid and it helped to really get me interested in the band.  The material on the album is darker than on the previous Van Halen releases.  Check out the instrumental \\"Sunday Afternoon in The Park\\".  That is one really creepy and trippy song!  The most accessible songs are \\"Unchained\\", \\"Mean Streets\\", and \\"So This is Love?\\".  All were but hits on the radio back in the early 1980's.  I also really love the sleazy \\"Dirty Movies\\", the breakneck \\"One Foot Out The Door\\" and the laid back \\"When Push Comes to Shove\\".  \\"Fair Warning\\" may not be the most popular album of the David Lee Roth era but it is essential.
1582701709|5.0|It amazes me how reluctant people are to acknowledge someone elses views as valid. Personally as a Catholic, I have spent my whole life feeling that I cannot live up to expectations. This ideology helped me realize that there is more to my life, and that I have more power than I could have ever imagined. It's about being positive and assertive for your own progress. What it is getting at is that you need to focus, and do it often about the things that you need in your life, because without focus, without intent, you will accomplish absolutely nothing. How would you take action without focus? That's how I used to operate, and I was lucky to get anyting. This product offers tools to help you live your life better. I have bought it for many people who are going through struggles in their lives and they have thanked me for it. Don't be so judgemental.

B0015D3Z4O|4.0|Well It isn't her best cd, but she tried something different. You have to respect her ability to reinvent herself. A totally different sound from her classics Ray of Light and Confessions on a Dancefloor, but it is a good cd. Quality music but I do miss the the less commercial Madonna. I guess she really wants out of her deal with Warner... Either way Hard Candy is definately worth a listen.
0446402389|5.0|Following the great victory over the Nazis, war hero Leo Stepanovich Demidov becomes a member of the state security MGB that insures there is no crime for citizens to be frightened of; ironically it is the MGB that frightens citizens.  In 1953, his meteoric rise continues though he knows any political enemy could do him in.<br /><br />In Moscow, he is removed from a high profile case to investigate the death of a child.  Outraged by the affront and feeling belittled, Leo assumes this is a waste of time even after the parents the Andreevs insist their son Arkady was murdered; making the case more embarrassing to pursue is the father of the late child works for Leo.  Rejecting their claim of homicide as murder does not exist in the Soviet Union, Leo assumes suicide is accurate.  He plans to end the investigation, but is side tracked when his wife Raisa is accused of being a western sympathizer, ergo an enemy of the state.  Guilt by association and rumor, Leo is demoted and exiled from the city.  However, he soon uncovers evidence that shakes his belief system as there is a serial killer loose who is not legally an enemy of the state and therefore not a criminal.<br /><br />This is an excellent historical police procedural in which the audience will feel they fell through the rabbit hole into Stalin land.  Leo is terrific as his belief in the state is right and murder cannot happen in Stalin's Soviet Russia is frightening.  When he finally accepts the facts that he could not believe until they became overwhelming, he concludes murder is not a state crime.  Fans will appreciate this strong tense and original thriller.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

It means a strong desire to live taking the form of a readiness to die.\\"<br /><br />Orthodoxy is filled with insightful information regarding some of the most poignant critiques against the Christian faith. This book should serve as a starting point for all exploration into the topic. What's more frightful than arguing with someone who has a lot of answers? Probably arguing with someone who can generate just as many questions and can argue your side of the issue better than you can. We usually only think on one side of the issue (our position), but Chesterton expounds both.<br /><br />It isn't necessarily a very easy read, but it is still very relevant for today's skeptic. Begin here: \\"The sense of the miracle of humanity itself should be always more vivid to us than any marvels of power, intellect, art, or civilization.\\" Any book that looks to refute something must begin with awe in the fact that there is an intellect which makes it even possible to toil in the world of ideas and fact.  A great follow up book would be [[ASIN:0786174366 Mere Christianity]].
B00005JPS7|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. has proven again why Hollywood loves him so and Favrue has topped himself with a directorial effort that none could have expected.<br /><br />A proven comedy director with his previous efforts, Favrue has crafted a piece of true magic that holds together brilliantly.<br /><br />Not a love story like Spiderman, a tragic hero like Batman, Wolverine or the Hulk, nor a boy scout like Superman, Iron Man is something new to the film side of the genre--a hero who enjoys being a hero!<br /><br />Yes, he seeks redemption. Yes, he is flawed. But this film lets the audience in on a new aspect. Heroism isn't all responsibility and secrecy. It can be fun and it can be more than comic relief, as in the case of Johnny Storm in the Fantastic Four franchise.<br /><br />Aside from this, the special effects are awesome, the action is well executed and the Downey brings a joy to his performance rarely seen in a superhero film.<br /><br />While Downey has done some excellent supporting roles in recent years, not since his legendary performance in Chaplin has Downey really shown what he can do.<br /><br />So here's to Marvel, Downey and Favrue! Thanks for giving the superhero film something new, JOY!
1416914293|4.0|CITY OF ASHES takes the potential of COB and lives up to it. More dynamic, more emotional, and more surprising, I believe COA far surpasses its already wonderful predecessor and sets the stage for the third novel.<br /><br />Clary believed herself to be a normal human until she saw Jace, Isabella, and Alex kill a boy - a demon. Now she's hopelessly involved with the world of the Shadow Hunters, struggling against Valentine. Valentine used to be a Shadow Hunter and now he is stealing their most precious artifacts (the Mortal Instruments) one at a time. Jace, the most talented of the four, faces prejudice from the older Hunters because of his past. Clary just wants to go back to being a normal human with her best friend Simon, who wishes he weren't so mundane. Magnus Bane steals every scene he's in once again - it's most satisfying the Clare gives him more screen time. She also satisfies with her continuations of the previous relationships.<br /><br />Actually, I find myself in a bit of a corner with COA. It's difficult to even discuss the plot of the novel without revealing many of the first book's surprises. I can only recommend you pick up both of these urban fantasy novels, and not just for the shiny covers. (Not that the shiny covers hurt. Can you say gorgeous? Cliff Nielsen, I've loved you for ages, but you've really outdone yourself with Clare's covers. Keep `em coming baby, keep `em coming.)<br /><br />Want humor, angst, glittery warlocks, civil war, and flying motorcycles? Enter the world of the Shadow Hunters.<br /><br />Excerpted from In Bed With Books
032147404X|5.0|I am an amateur photographer with not a lot of free time on my hands.  I loved this book, because it was short and to the point and got straight to the essentials of taking good photographs.  For example, all the photography books talk about the need for a tripod, but which one do I get?  There are about a billion choices.  I don't have the time to do extensive research, so it's nice that the book gives some suggestions. Also, finally a book that gives you great hints, like how shoot fireworks.  I loved the author's sense of humor, although some of the reviews criticized it.  It makes reading more enjoyable.  I highly recommend this book.
0452286751|5.0|At first, this book's size was intimadating but it flowed wonderfully.  The story is incredibly deep and if you're not in the mood to read something that will make you think then you definitely need to look elsewhere.    The characters are incredibly well thought out and possess such strong presence that it's easy to get a clear visual of everyone of them.  I often found myself smiling at the constant mental acrobatics that took place between them and their fervent need to one-up each other.  If people truly spent this much time analyzing one another, I don't think we'd actually get anything accomplished.      At the heart of this novel is Rand's theory of objectivism which completely asks us to redefine what we believe to be \\"selfish\\".  Often many people who are considered selfish are those who seek money/power/recognition from others, but if your concern is primarily based around the preception of others then you're not really focused on yourself and so how can you truly be \\"selfish\\"?  All drive and motivation needs to come from within and stay there.    I found myself reevaluating some of my past (and current) decisions throughout the entire time I was reading this book.  I was completely enthralled in Rand's world and will definitely pick up Atlas Shrugged to see where she went next.

B0001WTWCO|3.0|I have to say I enjoyed this movie as it showed how far a man would go for the woman he loved, but the full frontal nude scene spoiled it.  Kristen Scott Thomas's character could have pull a towel around herself as she stepped out of the bath, but I guess morals went out the window as they were having an affair and she was a married woman, which I thought was wrong.  She should have left her husband if she wasn't happy before having an affair.  Ralph Fiennes played the part of the Count well, I preferred the parts where the nurse was taking care of him and it showed how caring a nurse is to her patient.  I would recommend this movie, but fast forward the nude scenes.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Once again I begin with a warning that you need to sit through the really, really long credits for what might be the best cameo appearance since Sean Connery showed up as King Richard the Lionheart at the end of \\"[[ASIN:B000092T6M Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves]].\\"  That was the last time I remember people really applauding a cameo in a film, although I should point out that everybody left at the end of the first showing of \\"Iron Man\\" were True Believers who instantly recognized the actor and the character as soon as the first words were out of their mouth.  Ironically, the cameo by Stan Lee in the film seemed to go right by the audience, because there was no reaction to what was a pretty good gag (it happens when Stark shows up at the big party).<br /><br />Now that I have that bit of business out of the way, let me say that \\"Iron Man\\" is the best comic book superhero movie I have seen since \\"[[ASIN:B00005JMQW Spider-Man 2]].\\"  I would say that the latter is better, mainly on the strength of Alfred Molina's wonderful performance as the villain and the great fight sequences between Spidey and Doc Ock that take place on the vertical as well as the horizontal axis, but \\"Iron Man\\" might be the more solid film (i.e., lower top but higher bottom).  There was a point when the number of comic books that Marvel was putting out exploded (e.g., the New Universe titles) and I dispaired over all of the idiotic cloning with Spider-Man and was down to reading only two Marvel titles: [[ASIN:0785107576 Daredevil]] and [[ASIN:078512764X Iron Man]].  This was back when Frank Miller was doing DD and Tony Stark was a full-blown alcoholic.  Daredevil might have been cooler, but as Iron Man, Stark always had the advantage that he was a regular guy, by which I mean that he did not have any superpowers.  He was just a really smart guy who could invent the gadgets that would make Iron Man work (eat your heart out [[ASIN:B000294TC4 Ned Kelly]]).  That is certainly what we get with director Jon Favreau's pre-summer blockbuster, with the added angst of Stark growing a conscience and using his armored alter-ego to help restore balance to his own little corner of the universe at war.<br /><br />Ultimately the best parts of the movie are the opening act, in which Stark is captured (Afghanistan today instead of Vietnam of the Sixties)and has to built the metallic grey Tin Woodsman on roids prototype armor, and the second act, where he works out the new suit.  This movie has two or three of the best violent slapstick gags you have ever seen in one of these movies, which engenders some of the biggest laughs.  The origin of the character is fairly faithful, for being updated, to what happened in \\"Tales of Suspense\\" #39, which was plotted by Stan Lee, scripted by his brother Larry Leiber, drawn by Don Heck, with a cover art by Jack Kirby (who created the character's original look, although it was Steve Ditko who first drew the red and gold armored version).  There certainly is more than a touch of \\"[[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]]\\" to the way Stark dons the Iron Man armor, but as much as I would give credit to the specific effects in this movie, attention must be paid to the screenwriting teams of Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby (\\"[[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men]]\\") and Art Marcum & Matt Holloway.  For all of the humor in the script, there is a strong thread of serious stuff extending throughout this film.<br /><br />As Tony Stark, Robert Downey, Jr., a superb actor whose skills in the verbal repartee department were honed on \\"[[ASIN:B000V8952K Ally McBeal]],\\" may well be the most glib superhero we have seen on the silver screen.  Certainly he is more glib than we would every have suspected Stark to be, but of course Downey's personal life clearly echoes the character ark of his character (it is that resonance as well as his undeniable talents that make him perfect for the role).  As Pepper Potts, Gwenyth Paltrow is more of a romantic  figure for Stark than she was in the [[ASIN:0785118608 comic book]], especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.  However, the point is not so much potential romance as it is the fact that with Paltrow we have an actress who can go toe to toe with Downey in quick paced nuanced conversation (although many will think that Downey's best scenes are with his robotic assistant with the fire extinguisher).  Besides, by have Rhodes instead of Hogan we not only get another acting talent on the level of the Downey and Paltrow with Terrence Howard, but as fans of the comic book know (and the movie acknowledges), one day down the road Jim is going to get to be in the red and gold suit.<br /><br />Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) is set up as a godfather to Tony Stark and a regent to Stark Industries instead of being a rival munitions magnate, which provides a bit of Oedipal conflict to the proceedings and compels the big fight at the end to be with Iron Monger (I was actually hoping for Titanium Man even though I was half expecting the Mandarian).  But most people who come to see this movie are not going to know any of this stuff, and even most of the comic book fans who will end up making repeat trips to the theater to see this one are not going to be old enough to remember the original Virginia \\"Pepper\\" Potts who ended up with Happy Hogan versus the \\"[[ASIN:0785121382 The Ultimates]]\\" version of the character.  All that really matters is that the cast and characters are a perfect mesh and the people who put this movie together should be thinking not just about a sequel but about a series.  With this launching platform, Iron Man could well replace Superman in the Big Three of comic book superheroes in the movies along with Spider-Man and Batman.8 comic book]], especially since Happy Hogan (director Favreau) has been relegated to a minor role as Stark's bodyguard to make room for the character of Jim Rhodes.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I've been a fan of REM since the beginning of this band, and the sound this band has played on every new CD is always surprising. This is no exception to that.

B00004W50T|5.0|This album literally has no peer. Especially when you consider that it was originally released in 1968. It is emotional, formative, revolutionary, etc.<br /><br />You can hear the emotions when you listed to Richard Manuel sing about loneliness. Or Garth Hudson putting his all into the organ. Or Levon Helm drawling out his words. Or Robbie Robertson playing a great riff. Or Rick Danko singing in his country-bumpkin voice. It was formative in that it heavily influenced so many musicians, as it has been said--there were a lot of blues musicians walking around England with this LP under their arm.  You can see that it is revolutionary when you consider that it truly was counter-countercultural in its revival of folk/country/americana within the framework of popular music. It came just when when people were getting sort of sick of cheezy psychedlia. And The Band \\"rebelled against the rebellion\\" by including a picture of them with their \\"ruralish\\" families on the album. They were going back to what most countercultural icons were trying to get away from. And the front cover certainly runs counter to the ego-trips that many other musicians were pulling off at the time. If you didn't know: The cover art is a painting by Bob Dylan!<br /><br />Here are some thoughts on individual tracks: \\"Tears of Rage\\" is powerful, patently SLOW and DRAGGING.  \\"To Kingdom Come\\" is forceful and jumpy. Sometimes it is maligned, but it is one of my favorites. I love the \\"Tarred and Feathered\\" part.<br />I'm not a huge fan of \\"In A Station\\". Its the only track that isn't amazing, in my opinion. I don't think I've ever encountered any other album where only one track was in this category!! \\"Caledonia Mission\\" is funky and a great showcase of Rick Danko's talent. If the \\"The Weight\\" weren't so overplayed whenever anything remotely close to the band is mentioned, I think we'd find it to be even better than it appears! It really is a fine song! Actually, its more of a \\"tale\\" than a song. \\"We Can Talk\\" is another one of my favorites. The part that goes something like \\"I'd rather burn in Canada than freeze down here in the south\\" is priceless! \\"Long Black Veil\\" is great though perhaps not as remarkable as some of the others. \\"Chest Fever\\" is funky and just plain odd, in a good way.  At the beginning it parodies some classical music (with a great intro by Garth), then it rambles with slightly non-sensical lyrics, but a great progression and rhythm. \\"Lonesome Suzie\\" show cases Richard Manuel's great talent (and probably showcases some of his deep personal struggles too).  \\"This Wheel's On Fire\\" is great. The voicing on this is just priceless. You have to listen to it, I can't put it into words well. \\"I Shall Be Released\\" is a quite fitting conclusion to the album.<br /><br />There is remastering and they've added tracks on this album. The extra tracks are good, though I am a bit of a purist and am sort of iffy about seeing the outtakes on there. But its no big loss. You get the original songs (remastered that is) plus the extras! \\"Key To The Highway\\" is my favorite of the extra tracks, though many will probably disagree with me on that one.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to this album, please do so!! ESPECIALLY if you feel informed about 60's music.  So many stereotypes of 1960's music are SHATTERED by this groundbreaking album!! In my opinion, you just can't beat this! Its well worth whatever you have to shell out to get it. It has intelligent, thoughtful, emotional lyrics. It has a distinct, American sound. It is black music, blues music, country music, folk music, gospel music, etc. And yet remains grounded!  It is jovial, minimalistic, but heavily spirited. I'll take this over The Beatles, Jimmi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, The Who, CCR, Cream, Jefferson Airplane, etc. ANY DAY!  No comparison!e of my favorites.

0307265730|4.0|After reading The Namesake, I knew what basic style and subject matter to expect from Lahiri.  She did not disappoint with this collection of short stories.  The generational differences represented in addition to the juxtaposition of the Indian and American cultures allows the reader to empathize with the characters even though many of us have never experienced life in quite the same way.  I can understand why some reviewers felt downtrodden by these stories because the weight of them was overwhelming at times, but there is something to be said for taking the author at her word about the validity or at least the possibility of such a turn of events.  The vignette style of most of the stories is reminiscent, to me, of Joyce's Dubliners, leaving something unresolved and yet natural and \\"real life\\" feeling.  I have never experienced a book before where the cover was part of the story in a way that the narrative did not directly express.  If you've read the book you'll understand, but the experience was so intriguing to me that I won't spoil it!
0380715430|5.0|This book is a notch above Bryson's other books. And that is saying A LOT! It is compelling, very witty, and overall memorable. It certainly piqued by interested in the English language and linguistics in general. Do yourself a favour, and get this book. You will not be disappointed with this well-researched tome that Bryson produced here.
B000K15VSA|4.0|I'll be honest, I got this collection purely for the fact that it had the original 1984 release mixed in with it.<br /><br />Ridley Scott pulled a George Lucas and fiddled with the film. The \\"Final Cut\\" content-wise is NOT better than the \\"Directors Cut.\\" It added nothing to the story.<br /><br />I do appreciate that they cleaned the film up but I wish they had done it to the original 1984 Version. Most people who are fans of this film are fans because of that cut. Scott should realize that fans have been waiting for a good version of that 1984 cut and restored it as well. The film wouldn't be what it is today without that version. I missed having the narration by by Harrison Ford. I was so very happy that I could get that version on DVD instead of having to drag out the old VHS version.<br /><br />I could have gotten a cheaper edition of this film to be sure but I like these specially boxed anniversary type collections. I haven't had time to watch the special features yet, so I can't review that part. All I can tell you is I like the fact that they're there.<br /><br />If all you want is the 1984 version, I would recommend you find one of the 4-Disc sets or maybe a used set.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Update January 18, 2009: I have finally watched the special features. The \\"making of\\" disc is a pretty in-depth look at what went into making this film. Very enjoyable. Had they had it available, i would have bought a collect that was just the original cut and the making of disc. Even so, I'm very happy with my purchase. Though Now that Blue-Ray has finally won the HD Wars, it may be one of the few DVDs I'm going to replace including Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Firefly/Serenity, Transformers, and a few others.

0743454537|5.0|A friend of mine owned this and let me read it.  It's an unbelievably sad story.  I had a hard time setting this one down - reading it every chance I got.  Often wondering what I would do in the same situation...I have never felt so torn between 2 sides.  It's been a while since I read this - and still remember it very clearly.  I cried like a baby at the very end. Jodi is now one of my favorite authors.
1582701709|4.0|Expectations, gratitude, and giving.  These are few of the many attributes that are taught to the majority of us mortals at a very early age.  During our youth, for most of us these actions are easy to apply.  It is with aging, and adulthood that we are hit with challenges of life.  The challenges of life at times have a tendacy to alter our thoughts and actions.  Infact because as humans, once the dilemas hit us head on, we tend to over look the three simple actions mentioned above in this book.  Why? Not because we want to.  It is because life's hardships have a tendancy to comsume and preoccupy our thoughts. Trials and tribulations in life often take the place of seeing or having great expectations for one's self.  When you are hurting it's hard to display gratitude or give  anything for that matter. The secret is no longer a secret anymore! I am so glad that my brother Michael encouraged me to read it.  When life throughs a gut punch at you, no matter how hard it seems, throw a little bit of inner expectation, and gratitude, back out into the universe.  Give something of yourself to someone else. Yesterday,I had a very long day at work.  Ronald Brown Academy, the school that I currently teach at in Detroit Michigan, had their very first Read-a-Thon. After work, I volunteered to read from the book I wrote several years ago. The children and parents that attended this event absolutlely loved it. I absolutely loved it. This book has helped me tremendously with placing my thoughts back on the right track.  Thank you author Rhonda Byrne.  I'm going to continue to visualize so that<br />all my hopes and dreams will materialize.<br /><br />Adra Young<br />Author of: The Everyday Living of Children & Teens Monologues
B0011HOEY4|4.0|What a movie!  Superb acting; but difficult for me to see my favorite actor in such a cold blooded role.  But, I guess that is what makes him such a great actor, playing a wide variety of roles so convincingly.  Yes, I am a Denzel fan; but all of the actors did an amazing job.  Glad Ruby Dee was recognized for her performance.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|NCIS just keeps getting better and better.  Season four was great.  Can't wait for season five (the current season - with only a few new eps to go) to be released on dvd.  We ejoyed it very much.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|The songs that are awesome make up for the ones that aren't so great. Bleed it out is my new fav song by lp & shadow of the day.  The live show was even better!
B0013FDM7E|2.0|It had great effects, but anyone over 12 had to notice that much of it just did not make sense. Smith is supposed to be a brilliant virologist, but when he sees a manequin placed where it will attract his attention he behaves like a child and gets his faithful dog killed.  The \\"darkseekers\\" are supposed to be raving maniacs, but they are smart enough to anticipate Smith's reactions and to engineer a clever mechanical trap. If they were that smart they would just get weapons or explosives and kill him.  If he was so stupid as to not recognize enemy action, he would not be a virologist. After he is saved from death, at the last possible instant, and taken home, he pulls a gun on his rescuers. You have to be amazingly stupid to think you need a gun with someone that just saved your life.  When the director has an unlimited budget and good people, the result should be better than this.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|The release of Portishead's third record is a MOST MOMENTOUS AFFAIR!!!<br />There is NO WAY I will accept THIRD unless I listen with fresh ears.<br />In fact, that its been 11 years since \\"P,\\" was released, I would hope for something different...and I got just that. Frankly, DUMMY, which is a very good record paled in significance for me when \\"P\\" was offered up. Did it take X number of listens before it grabbed hold of me, ultimately holding on and never letting go??? Yes.<br />Portishead's sophomore release for me, stands alone as one of the GREAT recordings of all time. So, in the same way, I am listening and allowing it to wash over me, thus seducing me in the process. There are some beautifully written reveiws on this site, by people who have great command of the art of reviewing. To those people I say thank you! THIRD is a stark and moving  canvas!!! I suggest that all those people out there that have been quick to judge, might choose to give it more time to grow on you as well.<br />CHEERS!
B000VBJEEG|2.0|I was so disappointed by this movie. All the hype and talk and ...nothing. The animation was absolutely excellent, really outstanding. The story was rather slow and had way to many \\"messages\\". The \\"don't steal\\" message had me rolling my eyes every single of the 10000 times it was mentioned. It was an obvious way to build up to the climax of the story. And really, G rated? There is a woman, with a gun, wrestling with a man for said gun and then they make up; the kissing scene - you can see their tongues moving inside their cheeks and there is the full body checkout by Linguini...ok....oh well. The story dragged on too much, it was boring...but the animation was excellent.
6304712499|5.0|The comic book is really great and the movie trys to equal that greatness and fails; however, as a stand alone movie it is very excellent.<br /><br />I just hope they keep making other Spawn movies (with the length between the  only one and present day I would have to say we aren't going to get another).<br /><br />This is just another repackage of the movie from years ago. The only difference is the Director's Cut. Meaning its extra scenes and other bonus footage.<br /><br />You have to be one that likes the extras to purchase this as if you had the original dvd of this you probably could pass on this one.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Amy, Amy, Amy.....(to quote a song from this album)<br />FRANK, the debut by the wildly talented Amy Winehouse, released five years ago, is a fusion of 1940s and 1950s jazz/blues and contemporary soul. These songs were released when Ms. Winehouse was nineteen and filled with worldly insight. Yes, most of it's pretty bitter and uncensored accounts of her bad experiences with men, the infamous subjects of her song \\"F-Me Pumps,\\" who are aging golddiggers, and frank observances about substance abuse and sex.<br /><br />The band is tight and seamless here. The combination of a soaring horn section, soulful percussion and Amy's sultry vocals make the album as technically brilliant as it is entertaining. I found myself giggling, because her lyrics are just so honest and real! Amy doesn't pull any punches. I particularly love \\"Amy, Amy, Amy\\" which is a grand nod to the great jazz and soul bands of the 1930s and 1940s. Damn, that horn is seductive. Also, she penned all of the tunes on this album herself, with the exception of her beautiful, reggae-inspired cover of \\"Moody's In the Mood For Love.\\" You really can't compare her to anyone! One of a kind.......Brilliant, wonderful and bitingly intelligent..........
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|If I'm going to purchase a DVD I will more than likely purchase the Unrated, Special Editions, Director's Cut, etc over the normal dvd.<br /><br />For the Kingdom of Heaven I thought I did that with the 2 disk[[ASIN:B000AARKOO Kingdom of Heaven (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] Well the extra stuff they toss in this 4 disk made it worth buying again.<br /><br />If you don't really like the extra disks and all the extra content then I would stick with the 2 disc and call it a day.<br /><br />If you like the extra's then I would purchase this. If you haven't bought your copy yet of any of KoH then just get this 4 disc one.
B0014BECF8|5.0|It is a fantastic collection of songs from one of the best singer / songwriter in the world.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|James Blunt pretty much came out of nowhere back in 2005. Although his first single \\"High\\" didn't really do much chart-wise (well, in the U.S., anyway), \\"You're Beautiful\\" was so tremendous that I don't think I have to remind anyone of its popularity. And although the rest of [[ASIN:B000301YY8 Back to Bedlam]] was great, \\"You're Beautiful\\" is still the only hit single James has seen thus far. Fortunately, All the Lost Souls proves that he's not just a one-trick pony.<br /><br />I'm surprised that a lot of people are calling this album dark; in fact, the only song I can see that really gets down to that level is possibly \\"Same Mistake\\". But speaking of the same mistake, the only really \\"fast\\" track on Back to Bedlam was a song called \\"Out of My Mind\\", and I didn't care for it, but fortunately James figured things out and made songs like that work this time around, as evidenced by \\"Give Me Some Love\\".<br /><br />Other notable selections include the first two tracks (\\"1973\\" and \\"One of the Brightest Stars\\"), as well as his latest single, \\"Carry You Home\\". But the acoustic (and shorter) version of \\"1973\\" at the end of the album is really unnecessary because it doesn't sound any different from the original version (and aren't all of James' songs pretty acoustic anyway?). It's not too late to pick up All the Lost Souls, so go to the record store and do just that.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert

B00005YW4H|5.0|I know I'm a little late to be jumping on Norah's bandwagon, but this young woman's got it all, including The Handsome Band! Wow! This is the first of her music in my collection and nearly everyone I have shared it with wants to add it to their collections as well. This one's a keeper and I imagine I'll pick up another copy of it somewhere along the way besides some of her other CDs. If you haven't heard this one and you're looking for the perfect mix for relaxing with a few friends on the deck or patio, then this one's for you. Her voice is like velvet on the one hand and then again, in other songs, it's got a lot of spunk. If I were to use one word to describe Norah's voice and musical ability, it would be \\"Classy!\\"
006135323X|5.0|Ariely's ideas are not new - much of the research documenting same findings can be traced back to the 1960's - but his presentation in the context of everyday life makes 'Predictably Irrational' a very worthwhile read. Amongst many other things, the author discusses: free is not really free, and why are we so afraid of making the wrong choice; role of decoys in pricing; social versus market norms, and the funny logic that decides between the two; our tendency to overvalue what we posses.<br /><br />The list goes on, but the point is: entrepreneurs, managers, stay at home parents, and everyone else in between will find something that applies to their daily routine. The book is not about 'fixing' your irrationality, but rather, about becoming aware of our own, often illogical decisions, and coming up with a way to preempt these events.

B000G8NXYQ|4.0|Movie set in the 1930's in a small town in Italy on the Adriatic.  The movie initially feels like a series of disconnected and chaotic sequences that lack structure and direction.  But hang in there - it comes together masterfully.  The story of the town, a young boy growing up, a family and the community dealing with the fascist regime is filled with colorful and whacky characters.  It is wrapped in beautiful spell bounding scenes of dandelion seeds drifting in the wind bringing on the spring season - to a wide-winged peacock mesmerizing the watchers in light snow fall - to a massive new ship approaching crude boats as the town watches on from far below.  This is a funny, beautiful, dreamlike movie...
B0002WZTOI|4.0|Writting a review about Top Gun is like making one about dinner at McDonalds: you know well in advance what the product is and what you will get. (and you get it)<br /><br />This said I must add that I loved this DVD because of the bonus material. It is long and VERY informative. I would have paid double the price just for this stuff. If at any time in your life you had to confess that you liked this movie then please buy this DVD set.<br /><br />You will not regret it for a second.<br /><br />Why then not 5 stars? Well,in my case, thoug audio quality is good, I think volume level is low and I had to adjust my TV volume control at very high level.
B000295SH4|5.0|I just receive the import version of  \\"The Journey:The very best of donna Summer yesterday.  I bought  it because of the second cd with extended remixes of songs like:  \\"I feel Love\\"(Patrick Cowely mega mix) \\"On the radio\\" 12 inch version.  I haven't heard \\"I feel love\\" (Patrick Cowely) in 30 years!  I heard \\"I feel love\\" on a Disco station called Disco 104 FM in Sonoma county when I was 13.  It brought back memories!  \\"On the radio 12 inch version was from the movie (Foxes) It is different than the version from Donna Summer's \\"On the radio\\" greatest hits in 1979.  I wished that Amazon.com would have had seperate reviews for the improt version and US version of \\"The Journey The best of Donna Summer because I ended up  buying the US version twice!  I bought the Us cd from a local store for 18 dollars when it came out in 2003.  It does not show on the back of the cd that there is a bonus cd included.  The information listed for the import showing all the tracks is NOT the import version at all!  It is showing the US version.  This is misleading!!!  It needs to be corrected!  Don't like buying the US cd twice!  Not worth sending back since it's a better deal at $[...] that $[...] when it came out.  The import is  well worth it.  The Us cd has  remix of \\"Your so Beautiful\\" over 10 minutes long and  and the album and remix of Dream a lot's theme that also 10 minutes long.  I tried to find out if the first order with the Journey for $[...] was what I had since the information listed on it showed the  first cd I called coustomer service and the person said the order number I told him was wrong and when he asked for my e-mail he said that was wrong too!  Very fustrating!  It was too late for me to cancel that item online,so I'll keep it.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan since the 80's. She is only one of the few artists that continue recording from that decade. Of course she has to change a little bit of her music. Her arrangements are amazing and is truly an amazing entertainer! Hard Candy can be a little shock at the beginning but once you get on the floor dancing, you will love it!
B00005JPS7|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...<br /><br />I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in \\"The Incredible Hulk.\\")<br /><br />Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, \\"Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?\\"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.<br /><br />So go see \\"Iron Man.\\"  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, \\"Iron Man\\" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.were under-used).

0525950079|1.0|I am not going to rehash what has already been said over and over again by other reviewers.  My only commentary to this is that I reread \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" while on vacation in Italy last October.  I enjoyed it thoroughly as it rewhetted my appetite for Middle Ages architecture and building practices.  I found Pillars to be entertaining as well as educational.  \\"World Without End\\" I had hoped would be a sequel but instead of cathedral building, there would be bridges etc.  It kind of started that way but it ended up disappointing.  Why did I beat my brains out to finish this 1,000 page doorstop?  A test of wills; either me or the book.   I won but not without a fight.
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|This is one of those movies which everyone feels that they have to praise, so as to appear savvy and sophisticated. That's what conventional wisdom does. Kind of like not wanting to acknowledge a slight attraction to your own sex, it seems that some people feel the need to praise this film as high art, instead of plainly admitting that it's overrated nonsense that happened to earn high regard in the art and entertainment worlds during the sixties. Though, it is important to remember that many were in an altered state during this time. To be unusual does not automatically make something great or outstanding.    What's obvious is that the initial intention was to make a movie set in 'Swinging London' with the main character being a trendy fashion photographer. Plot and details weren't important for success $$$$. Subsequently, the masses have tried to project deep meaning onto this commercial film, which is as ridiculous as trying to find meaningful love in a horror or comedy. Honestly, the meaning is that there is no meaning; it's like a very long and pointless commercial or advertisement on TV. It's not about the product (what should be a good film with a plot), it's about the image.    I want my 2 hours back....
B00002MZ12|5.0|When i first heard Alanis Morissette, it was in 1995 when \\"You Oughta Know\\" played on the radio.  My first reaction to Morissette and \\"You Oughta Know\\" was not positive - it was \\"what is this, why is this woman so angry, and what is this chip on her shoulder?\\"   However as the subsequent singles from Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album were released, I soon began to see more than an angry young woman.   When I listened to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" in its entirety, I realized that this album lived up to all of the hype.  Not only did this album garner critical acclaim, but it was one of the best selling albums of all-time.    While her follow-up album, \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" did not generate the commercial success of \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", I still felt that it maintained the high quality standards set by Morissette.   It was these two albums that left many fans wanting a live album, thus in 1999 Morissette would release \\"MTV Unplugged\\".   This would provide a whole new spin on many of Morissette's classic songs as well as some lesser-known material.    \\"MTV Unplugged\\" albums contain recordings from the MTV series with the same name.   The idea was to showcase popular artists performing material with an emphasis on the acoustic material.  I do think this whole \\"Unplugged\\" angle is a bit too played out, however I like what Morissette brings to this particular \\"Unplugged\\" concert.   Yes she utilizes acoustic instruments, but she brings a more orchestral quality to her music - complete with piano, strings, and even Morissette playing the flute.  As a result, this is what contributes to the new spin on Morissette's material.    Here are ten thoughts on this collection - in no particular order:    1.The collection contains four songs from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" (\\"You Learn\\", \\"Head Over Feet\\", \\"Ironic\\", and \\"You Oughta Know\\").  There are three songs from \\"Supposed Future Infatuation Junkie\\" (\\"Joining You\\", \\"That I Would Be Good\\", and \\"I Was Hoping\\").   I found itinteresting that Morissette included the \\"hit\\" songs from \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", but opted for the lesser-known songs from \\"Junkie\\".  Also included are three unreleased songs (\\"No Pressure Over Cappuccino\\", \\"Princes Familiar\\", and \\"These R The Thoughts\\") as well as her soundtrack song from \\"City of Angels\\" (\\"Uninvited\\").  Finally, Morissette includes a cover of the Police's \\"King of Pain\\".    2.It is worth noting that this does not contain all of the material from Morissette's performance.  For example, some of the hit songs from \\"Junkie\\" that were performed that night were not included (\\"Baba\\", \\"Thank U\\").  Normally, a prefer a live album to include the entire performance from a single night - with the tracks arranged in the same order as they were performed.  This allows for the magic of the performance to be captured on the recording.  Despite the fact Morissette does not include some tracks, the arrangement of the tracks that are included is done very well    3.The three songs that were not prior released are outstanding.  I've seen some reviews rip these songs and I completely don't understand it.   These songs were left off the \\"Junkie\\" album, but it is important to know that they were competing with 17 powerful tracks from that album.  There's no shame being left off that collection.  All three tracks are outstanding and all demonstrate some of the Indian music influence that was so prevalent on the \\"Junkie\\" album.    4.Morissette's performance of \\"You Oughta Know\\" is very interesting.  On \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", this was the defining song for much of the anger that Morissette demonstrated on that album.  The unplugged version is softer and highlighted by some piano work and some great orchestral sounds.  This performance isn't going to show the angry Morissette, but it will put a whole new spin on one of her classic songs.    5-\\"Uninvited\\" also demonstrates a terrific orchestral backdrop.  In fact, this song isn't going to have much of an unplugged feel, but itis going to demonstrate some terrific orchestral sounds.   In fact, this song was tailor-made for the orchestral sound.    6-One of those most interesting songs included is \\"King of Pain\\".   It takes a few seconds for the audience to realize that this is a cover of the Police's classic song.   Normally I am never bowled over by an \\"Unplugged\\" cover, but this one really surprises.  It is going to be the piano that really gives this cover a whole new spin from the original.  This song includes some great background vocals from Deron Johnson.  This might be one of the strongest tracks of the collection.    7-One of the highlights of \\"That I Would Be Good\\" is going to feature a flute solo by Morissette.   It is worth hearing that track just for the flute solo.    8-\\"Head Over Feet\\" is a very good performance.  It starts out as a classic \\"Unplugged\\" acoustic sound and then progresses with many of the orchestral sounds that are prevalent on this collection.    9-\\"Joining You\\" is an unbelievable performance.  It really showcases Morissette's vocals in a live setting.  It will be the piano that gives this a terrific sound.    10-On \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", the chorus of \\"Ironic\\" was highlighted by Morissette's trademark raspy vocals.  On \\"Unplugged\\",  we are treated to some softer vocals.   Like many of the other tracks, once again it showcases a new spin on some favorites.    As with many live sets, the liner notes do not contain the lyrics.   We are told to go to Morissette's web-site for the lyrics to the unreleased songs.   The liner notes also contain the musician credits.  Overall this is an outstanding collection.  My only disappointment is that the whole performance isn't included on here.  However what one gets from what this collection provides is outstanding.   Highly recommended.
B000EWBNMS|5.0|If you love Ghost Whisperer your going to love Medium!! I just started watching Medium a couple of years ago and now I'm hooked! I'm purchasing all the past seasons to get caught up.
B000I5X81A|5.0|It's not often that the first time I listen to a recording I love it instantly, but that's what happened when I heard The Road to Escondido.  There really isn't anything not to like about this recording.  The songs, music, and the way that Clapton and J.J. Cale harmonize is just amazing.  My only hope is that they do this again and release another recording together.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This DVD is a classic.  It was fun watching this again, last time seeing it at the theatre and a couple of times on TV.  I would recommend it to anyone that was in college in the 60's or 70's.

B00000F14B|4.0|This is of course a classic big Broadway musical from the era of great tunes and great stars.  What makes this film particularly delightful after all of these years is the direction.  It is shot in such a way as to not just \\"open it up\\" as a film with songs (which it does), but it gives you the feeling of the stage show with the big numbers choreographed with an eye for the proscenium stage and even a curtain call and encore at the end.  You can see why Robert Preston was such a great performer (especially in this role).  Comedy buffs can get a renewed appreciation of Paul Ford and Hermione Gingold.  We can be charmed by Ron Howard and what a terrific actor he was at such a tender age...and marvel that there was such a creation as Shirley Jones with such beauty and such a voice....can't go wrong...
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I've seen Muse once in concert and I have all of their non-live recordings.  This is the first live recording of Muse that I have purchased, and let me tell you this; it was worth the money.    The DVD sounds stunning in 5.1 DTS, so if you have a receiver that can decode it, you're in for a special treat.  If not, the stereo sounds great too.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Our entire family is fascinated with this series. My husband, myself and our two older kids (5 and 3) love to watch different segments of this documentary. Beautiful shots of all parts of the world, but more importantly, parts we will most likely never see in person. Definitely worth the money!

B00005JPS7|5.0|Finally, Marvel Comics' ol' Shellhead arrives on the big screen, and he arrives with stunning force. I don't quite know if this is the best superhero film ever made, but IRON MAN's just about got me convinced that it at least ranks right up there with [[ASIN:B00005JMQW Spider-Man 2 (Widescreen Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition)]], and the first two SUPERMAN movies, with Christopher Reeve ([[ASIN:B000059Z8J Superman - The Movie]], [[ASIN:B000IJ79V6 Superman II (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]). Everything seems to have fallen into place for IRON MAN, from the knocked-out-of-the-park special effects to the well-written script, brought to life by a high caliber cast. It's just a good story told very well. And, as a bonus, it's surprisingly funny.<br /><br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) has got it all, riches and notoriety and an off-the-charts genius I.Q. A debonair gazillionaire who inherited Starks Industries, Stark has been content breezing thru his days as a freewheeling playboy/inventor. Swanky pad in Malibu. Fancy private jet with gorgeous stewardesses doubling as pole dancers. When asked to justify his company's role as the military's primary weapons provider, his flippant response is \\"Peace means having a bigger stick than the other guy.\\"<br /><br />But his worldview is forever altered when he goes to the Middle East for a weapons presentation. Terrorists blow up his vehicle, the resulting explosion causing shrapnel to be imbedded in his chest, very close to his heart. A makeshift electromagnetic device (hooked to a car battery) is implanted in his chest cavity, to prevent the shrapnel from piercing his heart. The terrorists, who hail Tony as the most famous mass murderer in America, insist that he build missiles for them. Accordingly, Tony is kept in a cave and given access to scrap metal and missile parts. But, Tony Stark, with nothing left to lose, decides to build something else...<br /><br />This film is awesome, definitely a fan boy's giddy dream. IRON MAN brings the thunder, delivers the goods. There are so many highlight, pump-you-up moments here, to relish and hoot and holler for. The first appearance of the clunky Iron Man armor. The first time he takes flight. Tony's step-by-step (and often hilarious) development of the new, sleeker model. The first time the new model goes into action. And much, much more. Let me just say, eyeing schematics have never been so much fun. It's pretty contagious, the sheer fun and enjoyment experienced by Tony as he goes about putting together his armor. His underground lab is an eye-popping marvel of hi-tech gadgetry, which includes an artificial intelligence named Jarvis (in the comics, Jarvis is an all-too human butler of Tony's and the Avengers'). And when Iron Man finally truimphantly blazes thru the skies in ridiculous velocities - well, whew! No complaints at all, at all with how the Iron Man armors are imagined on screen. Prepare to get blown away.<br /><br />IRON MAN is peopled by stock characters, no lie. The faithful, beautiful long-suffering, long-in-love assistant. The backstabbing business partner. The terrorists. Even the hero of the film isn't cut from a new cloth (uncaring industrialist undergoing a moral 180). But here's the thing: when these cliches are played by the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Jeff Bridges, and Robert Downey, Jr., well, then, the cardboard suddenly gains layers of depth.<br /><br />Iron Man had always been so far down my list of favorite superheroes, it's kind of pathetic. Before this film, I've never found him that interesting in the comic books. Too cold, too smug, too superior, too powerful...Plus, if you've been following the recent Civil War crossover event in the Marvel comics, Iron Man, in my eyes, played a very distasteful role. But Iron Man on screen is something else. On celluloid, he's dynamic and dazzling and oh so friggin' cool! But the thing that really puts it all together, that which makes thisflick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role. And to see him breathe life into Tony Stark is to think \\"Yes, of course!\\" - the man fits the part so seamlessly. Still handsome, but there's a well worn look to him now. Downey's done stuff and lived life outrageously, good and bad. And, really, that's Tony Stark to a T. Even more than Tobey Maguire is Spider-Man, Robert Downey, Jr. is Iron Man. For an actor who's had his ups and downs and for a brilliant formerly heartless ex-weaponeer who's literally had a change of heart, redemption comes in rip-roaring heavy metal...flick such a hands down winner and a box office monster, is Robert Downey, Jr. Downey brings his fabulous acting, his jaded charisma and his comic wit and timing to the role.

B00005JPS7|4.0|Iron Man is a Marvel Comic movie that doesn't disapoint. It's better than Spiderman 3 \\"which even Fantastic Four 2 was even more fun than\\" with more wit and a lot less whining, crying and.... disco dancing. Hell it's the best Marvel movie since Spiderman, Spiderman 2 and X-Men 2. It slowly picks up which is why it gets compared to the Hulk by some people. However it's always entertaining and more fun than the Hulk.<br /><br />  Robert Downey Jr's Stark slowly becomes Iron Man but the movie is never boring since Downey carries the film well with his quick wit. It has pleanty of laughs while Downey himself is very funny while totally owning the character of Stark. He also has chemestry with Gwyneth Paltrow who has a quick wit of her own here as a trustworthy employee of his. Terrance Howard is in good form as well as Stark's military friend. I also liked a bald Jeff Bridges as Stark's business partner. When there is action it's super cool and well done. But the movie wouldn't have been as good if Robert Downey Jr. wasn't casted. He's not just funny here but he shows that he can handle playing the heroic type and he does it well.
1883217040|4.0|Louis Armstrong said, \\"If you have to ask what jazz is, you'll never know.\\" And while I agree that jazz is something that comes from within, I think eventually, it does require some analysis and thought. In my jazz education (piano), occasionally, like all musicians, I hit a wall where I can't progress very far or very fast. It's then that I like to turn to this book and try to gain some insight. Levine's strength is that he really knows jazz well, so he can call on a vast number of real jazz examples: riffs, tunes, progressions, chord substitutions, whatever, from actual jazz songs by famous jazz musicians. This is an invaluable resource in that respect. The spiral binding allows the reader/musician to put the book right on the music stand, and play right out of it while reading (though I like to read first and go to the piano later). The reason I didn't give this five stars is because I already purchased [[ASIN:0961470151 The Jazz Piano Book]] and a lot of the material in Jazz Theory overlaps. So, if you are a non-piano jazz musician, I recommend this book, but if you are a pianist, I think you can skip this book and stick with the Jazz Piano Book.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|... I think yes, yes, yes.... my favorite band has returned.<br />A lovely long-awaited release.
0393051587|5.0|Of all the annotated classic works, this one is probably my favorite. I like it for a number of reasons. It can be enjoyed in one (longish) sitting. The notations are very informative and well-spaced so as not to take away from the reading of the story. The illustrations are in multiple styles by multiple artists, and they are very intriguing. It has some nice glossy prints including one of the cover of the original edition. It contains two version of the story, one being the public reading version, which is concise and invites you to make it a Christmas tradition at your house. And as with [[ASIN:0393049922 The Annotated Wizard of Oz  (Centennial Edition)]], [[ASIN:0393051633 The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales]], and others, this looks really good on the shelf. You know you like Dickens. This book will deepen your appreciation of the man, his talent, and this timeless and remarkable Christmas tale.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I wish I could demand my money back from the directors and producers of this stupid so called movie, made me sick to watch it, anyone buying this movie including myself is just throwing their money away...
B0013527I4|5.0|Same reaction to this one as the other sets; I had forgotten over the years what a fantastic program this was. Stellar guests stars, family-style humor, and creativity that is rarely seen today. This 3rd Season set is no exception. Standout guest stars include Gilda Radner, Pearl Bailey, Jean Stapleton, Loretta Lynn, Liberace (!), Raquel Welch, Helen Reddy, Sylvester Stallone, Danny Kaye, Harry Belafonte, Lesley Ann Warren, Lynn Redgrave, Roy & Dale, Cheryl Ladd, and more. Unlike other variety shows, these guest stars genuinely seem to be having a ball and enjoying themselves. Cheryl Ladd's episode turned out to be one of my favorites; known mainly for \\"Charlie's Angels,\\" she shows plenty of talent in singing & dancing (even more so than the somewhat stiff Raquel Welch). Her karate duet with Miss Piggy (\\"I Enjoy Being A Girl\\") is adorable. Jean Stapleton shows that she can carry a tune better than her famous character Edith Bunker; Gilda Radner also has a pleasing musical voice.<br /><br />The Bonus Features are fantastic; \\"Muppets on Puppets\\" is a one-hour black & white TV show from 1968 that is a VERY behind the scenes look at puppets/muppets; the different types, how to make them work, how to create them, and even a \\"behind the wall\\" look at Jim Henson & Frank Oz performing. Adults will really enjoy this; warning for parents who don't want children know how the \\"magic\\" happens, you may want to skip over this extra. Interesting to see Henson's flat-line persona in contrast to his extremely creative handling/vocals for the muppets.<br /><br />\\"A Company of Players\\" is a present day featurette that also goes behind the scenes; VERY cool to learn about how Miss Piggy came to be (especially the \\"why\\" behind her infamous karate chops!) and the way that Frank Oz & Jim Henson worked together (likened to any famous comedy duo). The happy camaraderie in front of the camera also existed behind the scenes.<br /><br />The Purina Dog Chow commercials are black and white featuring Rowlf the Dog & Baskerville; they are truly funny (still!). What they lack in picture quality, they make up for in fun. Sure is refreshing to see a simple commercial that can sell the message.<br /><br />Overall picture/sound quality on this set is high; many older shows shot on videotape have not held up over the years; this one IS an exception. Good color and image detail (you can even see the wood grain on the set doors), and the sound is pleasing also.<br /><br />For families, children, and Muppet fans, this set is a must-have!erville; they are truly funny (still!).

B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I've had this album for years, and everything that Paul Simon did up this point. Graceland was explosive, it rightly won record of the year (Grammies) for both '86&'87 and introduced many folk, including me, to world music. Simon is complexity. If you believe that good Science results in more questions than answers, this is the path. He makes it lyrical. Check out Hearts and Bones. Van Gogh's sales weren't so great for a while...
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I did not like the way this movie was recorded, I almost could not see anything, the camera was in a constant movement and finally I was tired of all this movement and I turned it off before the end.  I was surprised that the movied was produced by Paramout Picture.. I think next time they should select skillful people to record the films.
0143038583|2.0|I eagerly opened this book and plunged into a morass of words. How many does it take to complete a thought. Couldn't the author have read and applied Zinsser's book \\"On Writing Well\\" before tackling this meaty subject?      The content is right on, but the message was obscured by the prose. Too bad. I would have liked to have finished it, but by the time I read a complete sentence or paragraph, there so many modifiers and conditional phrases, I lost the main point. I found it boring because of that.    If someone edited this book, pulled out the content buried within and tightened his writing, Mr. Pollan could have made his point much better.
0099501473|5.0|A funny story of a young Chinese woman arriving London to study English for a year. There she doesn't only discover a strange Western culture (such as whipped cream and scones), but a difficult language (why is there a difference between \\"I\\" and \\"me\\"?) and an older man. The barrier of language and culture makes the love relationship hard, entertaining and sweet. Worth the read, if only to discover the meaning of inter-cultural competence.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Long-time Testament fan. I *really* expected this album to be in the vein of The Gathering. Surprisingly, Testament chose to rekindle the old sound that made them so famous. TFOD is classic-sounding, but misses the crunch and brutality of The Gathering (probably tuned guitars back up to E or E-flat). Nonetheless, after a few listens, I started to hear more and more of that sound from The Ritual. Melody in favor of speed, and some great vocal extensions (yes, we now all know that Chuck has 3 vocal styles).     Also missing is a \\"power ballad\\" (hate using that phrase). If you're going to bring back old-school thrash, why not tack on a ballad like Return to Serenity? Alex writes his best solos in that environment!    Bottom line - the album has really grown on  me. I like every song. Great lyrics, and awesome production. Support your favorite bands. Buy the album so they are encouraged and continue to produce great music.
0452289963|5.0|At first I thought that the material was ordinary, then I then I was challenged to think of old words like \\"ego\\" in a different way, then I was taught a whole new way of seeing the purpose of personality and practical ways to deal with the ebbs and flows of emotions.  The book offers a new way of thinking and dealing with life.  AWSOME!!  Critical thinking and willingness to see life from a different way are prerequisites for total enjoyment of this book.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|So, I am a music researcher and collect songs, especially from the Scandinavian countries. There are few very albums out there that compare in consistency and brilliance with this one. It's raw, liquid emotions, put into a CD and packaged under \\"The Silent Force\\".    I would give a review of each song, but I feel like that is best discovered by oneself. I LOVE exploring music and never read what other's think about particular songs (I do read review like these though). So, I think you should discover the magic that is this CD by yourself : ) You shouldn't be disappointed, especially if you like orchestral, epic/goth rock.     I highly recommend this CD! I was not disappointed, and if I could speak for you, (which I sadly can't : () I would say you will like this album also.
0143038419|4.0|Before reading \\"Eat Pray Love\\", I noticed that many of the reviews were highly polarized.  While overall I very much enjoyed this book, I can also understand those who didn't.  In many ways the book feels like a self-indulgent first draft that needs the hand of a good editor to tighten it up.  While Elizabeth Gilbert has an intimate style of writing and a witty turn of phrase, it did feel like EVERY funny story and EVERY clever thought had to be crammed in.  Sentences like: \\"every word was a singing sparrow, a magic trick, a truffle for me\\" - why use one metaphor in a sentence when three will do?!<br /><br />I found it interesting the way that the writing style mirrors Liz's journey.  When she starts out in Italy her writing is frenzied and self-obsessed.  We hear far more about her depression than we hear about Rome.  She revisits her failed marriage and failed relationship to the point that it feels like the book is stagnating.  What makes this extra frustrating is that when she does occasionally talk about Italy, her writing is exquisite.  She describes Venice as \\"a wonderful city in which to die a slow alcoholic death...spooky under its gray November skies\\".  Another standout for me is a wonderful description of going to a soccer game.  She also integrates quotes from famous people and facts about places very well.<br /><br />In the middle section of the book (at the ashram in India), the pace slows.  This section is mostly about Liz's struggles with meditation - lots of breakthroughs followed by setbacks, followed by more breakthroughs followed by yet more setbacks.  I found this section interesting, but it's not really about India.<br /><br />The final section, in Bali, was the standout for me, as Liz learns to assimilate the personal growth that she achieved in India into everyday life.  She builds some very real relationships with the locals and I found her descriptions of Bali and the culture to be insightful and interesting.  For the first time, it felt like she was able to look around and recognize that she was not the most interesting and important thing to write about.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, I very much enjoyed this book.  The short chapters and frequent humor kept me turning the pages and I warmed to Liz as I read on.  The idea of taking a year off from life is not something that I would be in a position to do, but I enjoyed reading about someone else's adventure.around and recognize that she was not the most interesting and important thing to write about.

B00139XZF4|1.0|i bought this dvd because I enjoy many kids dvds.  Lord of the Rings, August Rush, ect.    I also enjoy Sam Elliott, and I own many, many, of his movies.  I have not seen one lately, except for this one, so I decided to buy it.    If it had not been for his appearence in this movie, it would have been a complete bust.    VERY DISAPPOINTED!
B00007J5VN|3.0|This movie version comes across as being severely \\"dated,\\" unlike many other well-made movie versions of successful musicals.  It's a good account of Neil Simon's clever dialogue, but the cinematography misses most of the splendor of Bob Fosse's dance creations.  It's better than nothing, I suppose.  But, if given the chance, rush out and see any stage version first.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Well , when I first read that Madonna was working in a new style , acording to Justin , Timbaland and Pharrel , I first said : \\" This will be a bad record. I hope she don't try their sound much \\" . But my point of view totally changed when I listen to the first single \\"  4  MINUTES  \\" . This is Picho's review.    CANDY SHOP :       This opening track it's perfect! It's like welcome to her store , and it is sweet indeed. The very urban track it rocks. The lyrics for Candy Shop are so funny and sexy. This song at is says , it is sticky and sweet. One of my fav songs of the album.    4 MINUTES :        This brillant song it's like the future march. It rocks. The background melody makes you feel like an peepshow. The lyrics are very sexually and very playful. Without Justin , the song would not be cool as it does. Another fav !    GIVE IT 2 ME :     Iam very sure this single will be a hit. The bassline has something very funky that stucked in my head. The lyrics are very sexual but under a message. \\" I can go on and on and on / No one's gonna stop me now \\" . Those lyrics defenitly can tell us she love to live without stops. Another fav! But this is much better than 4 Minutes as a single.    HEARTBEAT :        LOVE IT! The lyrics can show that she really loves what she does. This song can be easily pick up as a single because it contains all what a single needs. A cool sound , expert lyrics and Madonna . LOL! It starts with heartbeats indeed.    MILES AWAY :       Not a ballad but something very romantic :) I love it! And Im sure that will be a great single. This could be an answer for Guy and Madonna's distance . This song starts with some guitars and finishes with the splendid \\"So far away .... \\" =) Another fav for me    SHE'S NOT ME :    Omg! This song really rock! It remains me off Lucky Star and you will defenitly pick this song as your favourite. She sings very nice. The lyrics show a filthy woman stealing \\"her\\" boyfriend by copying her. My favourite song of the album . It rooocks!    INCREDIBLE  :     This hell song rocks! \\" Sex with you is incredible \\" , it contains moanings and all .... the bassline its perfect! Many fans don't like the song , but I think they are wrong. The lyrics show a very \\"Incredible\\" relation , turned to a very shake-song. Another favourite .    BEAT GOES ON :    You can't find something similar to the first BEAT GOES ON, just the chorus. It is a club song 100% . And kanye's Rap makes it very hoooot! It should be a single and sang in her next tour.     DANCE 2NIGHT  :   100% Justin Timberlake! As a duo , it rocks! Timbaland and Justin appears again , here .... with a spectacular song! The chorus is catchy . It is an uptempo song (all of them , they are, or most of them). \\"Le'ts dance 2night\\" will thrill you more than ever. Another favourite.    SPANISH LESSON : And here comes the weak moment. This is not a bad song but not the best based in spanish men. The lyrics are very funny. A paradox on each sentence. And if you listen it twice you would find that the song it's strange. My least favourite song of it.    DEVIL WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU : Omg! From now on , this is my favourite ballad!!!!! The lyrics and the song are so beautiful as a team! Some rain in the instrumental , will remind you off Justin's CRY ME A RIVER . Then she sings very emotional \\" Even the devil wouldn't recognize you , I do\\" Pick this as a single , please Madonna! Love it!!    VOICES :   The best way to finish an album with a perfect song. Just love it. The \\" Who is the master \\" part thrills me a lot . Here you can listen a dark Madonna making you feel her slave. Another fav!    So here's my review       YOU SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM , IT'S GREAT
B0013D8LOK|3.0|I bought this DVD with the hope of clarifying some of the details that confused me about the stage version.  The good news is that the mood of living in London during this historical period was conveyed much more vividly than had been done on the stage.  The bad news was that there was much less attention given to the musical qualities of the work.  The worst news was that Helena Bonham Carter's dialogue was almost completely incomprehensible -- owing to her strong accent and low-volume mumbling style of speech.  I agree that she gives a great visual impression of the role, but I'm still trying to figure out some of the relationships that I missed in the theater.  No amount of fiddling with the volume control could help.
0783226837|5.0|Tremors is everything a monster movie should be.  It's an ode to 50s monster movies without shoving the \\"ode\\" part down your throat and constantly wink, wink, winking at you the way Rob Zombie and Quentin Tarantino have done.  Homage or not, it's a very good movie in it's own right.  In fact it's better than a movie like this should be.  Most everyone is familiar with the plot involving underground wormlike creatures terrorizing a small town in the Nevada desert.  Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are two handymen who stumble onto the monsters and then team up with the remaining townspeople to take a stand(only after the plan to flee fails).  Along for the ride are Michael Gross as the gun toting Burt(who would later become the central character of the movie and tv series'), and his equally weapon crazy wife played by Reba McEntire.  Be on the lookout for Big Trouble In Little China's Victor Wong as an unfortunate general store owner and David Lynch regular, Charlotte Stewart.<br />Everything about this movie is above average.  The acting is all around good, the comedy is dead on and kept in check without going overboard, the creature FX look very good(though some folks from the CGI generation may say they look silly, but what do they know?), the story is engaging and it's never boring.  This is a PG-13 rated horror film that sacrifices nothing for the sake of getting that rating.  It isn't meant to be a blood bath or sex romp anyway.  In fact, the amount of profanity and gore is more than you'd expect, but PG-13 actually meant something in 1990.  Practically all onscreen bloodletting is of the monster type anyway, not human, which is easier to get away with.<br />Most likely you've seen this before, but it certainly doesn't hurt to give a good thing another whirl(just ask my wife).  Probably one of the best horror flicks of the 90s and more fun than practically any horror film made in the last ten years.
B00104QSOM|2.0|An interesting account of the early days of the oil industry.  However, the entire production drags on with unrelenting accounts of the main character's personality problems.  I can't agree with the Oscar treatment.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|There are some really good tracks on here.  I don't find it as consistent as Confessions, but that was one of my favorite CDs ever, by Madonna or anyone, so that's a pretty high standard to achieve.  This CD is not disappointing...it may take a few listens, but the tracks start to have their individuality after that.
0316067601|5.0|This tale will have you biting your nails, holding your breath, and weeping quietly. All the while as you can't put the book down. What a fantastic story of patriotic men who have committed, with a capital C, their entire being to keeping us safe. It goes thru the making of a SEAL and you soon realize this life isn't for everybody. This part is a little lengthy but stick with it because it is background that shows how the training pays off in combat. The mission is non-stop action and  mind blowing terror. Read this book from cover to cover and I guarantee you if you weren't in awe of the SEALs before you will be now.
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is a brillant and creepy film from director David Fincher. This is probably Fincher's best film, his movies lately haven't been that good (Zodiac and Panic Room). Brad Pitt is nice eye candy but this guy is the real deal, he is a fabulous actor and this thriller proved it. Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow also star, both are really good as well. Kevin Spacey is flawless as a serial killer who toys with Pitt's character right up 'til the very end. I highly recommend this psychological thriller, enjoy!
B000NVL9KG|3.0|The song Tarkus is a spectacular mix of classical, rock and jazz which took up a whole side of the original record. I don't think I flipped this record over more than twice due to the lackluster tunes on side 2. I did however really like side 1. The title song, Tarkus is more of a suite comprised of several tunes pieced together to form what I think is very entertaining music. The rest of the album is as memorable as your senior prom band. If you really like Emerson, Lake and Palmer than this is a must have disc. If you are not a true ELP fan, than this is not for you. - Ciao

B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I saw another reviewer say that when you listen to System Of A Down you know right off the bat whether you love them or hate them.  It has never been that simple for me.  Some of the material on this album I really don't like much at all, and some I really dig.  Songs like \\"Violent Pornography\\" and \\"Cigaro\\" do very little for me.  Yea, I guess they are supposed to be funny or maybe shocking, but for me it just comes across as lame.  Some of the other songs on this disc come across as straight ahead nu-metal rockers that although ok for what they are, are kind of below what I know this band is capable of.  On the bright side the single \\"B.Y.O.B\\" is a good one as is \\"Radio / Video\\" in the middle of the album.  Where this disc really comes together are on the last 3 tracks \\"Sad Statue\\", \\"Old School Hollywood\\", and \\"Lost In Hollywood\\".  Although a bit mellower than the rest of the album I think they are the best 3 tunes.  This disc is hit and miss for me, but the guys are certainly unique.
B000002UAU|5.0|This classic, historic album is great to have in CD form--the booklet, with additional background material is a tremendous bonus. The songs all hold up with time, George Martin's genius as arranger/producer is overwhelming and certainly more diverse than Phil Spector, who later \\"Spectorized\\" them out of existence when there was no more left of the Lennon/McCartney team.    You can't buy this on iTunes, and you'll want all of the words to the songs, so whether it's for the instant nostalgia created by the song of the title of this review or the devastating brilliance of \\"A Day in the Life\\" that never fails to jar you, make sure this CD is in your collection.
B000BM6AVA|4.0|I can't think of any other band that sounds like these guys.  They are truly unique and although I don't like everything that they do, there is certainly a lot of talent to be found here.  The music combines elements of Nu-metal, progressive rock, and Zappa-ish mayhem.  Some of it is funny, some serious and some just plain over the top.  Lead vocalist Serj Tankian has an almost operatic voice that is very different from anyone else I can think of out there.  The band remind me a bit of The Mars Volta at times, although SOD's music is more blunt and to the point.  Highlights include \\"Attack\\", \\"Kill Rock N Roll\\", \\"Lonely Day\\", and \\"Soldier Side\\".  This is a band that I have to be in the right mood to listen to, and I kind of have to take them in small doses, but there is no doubt that SOD are one of the more unique bands in mainstream rock today.
B0000256VK|5.0|The title sums this up.  I won't even attempt to capture the beauty and majesty of this perfect release by a few, ill-prepared lines, strung together.  Rather, when it comes to this release, know this:  perfection; absolute perfection.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|I am NOT a diehard diehard Madonna fan. It is obvious which reviews are done by diehard fans, as they have no critique at all. Not everything Madonna touches is gold.  That is a good place for me to start. \\"4 Minutes\\" the lead single, has the stupidest lyrics in this reviewer's opinion. The beat is ok, but no doubt will get annoying after repeated listens (the horn loop reminds me of \\"Get Right\\" by Jennifer Lopez.    This is Madonna's final album on this record label. Half of me is suspicious that she only worked with Timbaland and Timberlake/ Danja and Pharell because she wanted a very commercial effort-to prove she was worth the 100 million dollar deal she signed with Live Nation? I'd like to think that she thought more of her fans than the almighty dollar, but everyone has their price.    I don't want to knock the album, but I feel this underlying feeling for this album. Where is the creativity? Why go with producers that have been DONE TO DEATH all of last year and this year?    There are good songs on this cd-\\"Give it 2 Me\\" \\"Miles Away\\" \\"Incredible\\" and \\"Beat Goes On\\" (My personal favorite on this cd..but the Kanye rap is kind of pointless though)   The mediocre to me: \\"Dance 2Nite\\" (reeks of Justin Timberlake) \\"4 Minutes\\" (something rubs me the wrong way)    Bottom line-I can't help feel she sold out in a way by using the latest producers and aiming squarely for the masses. Listen to the tracks first and decide for yourself.
B000VJ271A|5.0|very nice & perfect performance. Villazon have high wide tenor voice. Dessay too very well played & very well sing at this product.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Like most fans of Marvel Super Heroes, I couldn't wait to see this movie! So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or \\"ol' Shellhead\\"....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now. Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films. I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider-Man movie twice. I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this! 'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!<br /><br />A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN! Like all superhero movies should be....go see this movie!..and stay through the credits for a great cameo setting up the next installment......oh yes, there will be another!
B00139W3NE|3.0|It is easy enough to say that \\"the book was better than the movie\\" -- since it is usually true that books offer a wealth of world that can only be hinted at in a couple of hours -- but this is a clear and disappointing case where the cliche fits.  Even films like the Lord of the Rings or the Harry Potter series don't really measure up to the original books they were based upon -- but in the case of those films, especially the Lord of the Rings series, the movies work on their own.  They establish their own world and it feels like a real world -- the characters seem to live there, and to understand it without constantly explaining it to each other.  In the case of the Golden Compass, unfortunately, that just isn't true.  Lyra explains things about their connection to her daemon Pan, and several characters give fairly long speeches explaining details to each other that they either would have known or that the filmmakers should have found more cinematic ways to make clear to the audience.<br /><br />So far this sounds like I'm griping, and maybe I am -- I had high expectations for this film, since the books are brilliant and have a very strong visual component.  In the hands of someone like Peter Jackson, this could have been an amazing film.  As it stands it is merely competent -- the actors were chosen very well for their parts, but the script makes their dialogue a bit wooden, with every character announcing who they are and explaining their history every time someone new shows up.  Nicole Kidman as Mrs. Coulter and the young woman who plays Lyra are the only characters who are really given enough space to come across as real.  The daemons who are so central to the book feel more like sidekick pets than external manifestations of the living soul of the characters.<br /><br />On the other hand -- the film looks very good and for the most part the CGI components of the world mesh well with the realistic elements.  As a kind of living illustration to accompany the book after it has been read, the film works -- but not as a stand alone.s been read, the film works -- but not as a stand alone.
0452286751|5.0|I havent read a great deal of books on my own during my 18-years of life. Most of the novels I've read have been requirements for school, with the stuff I read on my own being things like Michael Jordan's bio and Mark Bowden's \\"Black Hawk Down.\\"     With that said, The Fountainhead is easily, and I stress *easily*, the best book I've ever read. I'm not even finished yet, as I'm around page 506 of 727... and I can tell.     This is something that every teenager in America should read by their Senior year in high school -- regardless of intelligence level or religion, etc. REGARDLESS if one does not agree with Rand's stance on society, the world and her philosophy of Objectivism that plays such an integral part in her classic novel, The Fountainhead should be a book that all read.     10/10 in my book.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Let's be blunt: this is the worst CD of Madonna's decades-long career - and trust me, I thought AMERICAN LIFE was the dregs, too. Flat, flavorless, boring, uninspiring, and shallow, this is the best krap money can buy.  She hired a gauntlet of high-priced \\"hot\\" producers and hoped if they supplied \\"urban contemporary\\" beats, she'd just phone it in over the top from London. The typically cynical, played-out formula adds a little bit GWEN, a pinch of JUSTIN, and a whole lot of lazy, tired Timbaland/Pharrell beats - toss in a whiff of self-absorption and utter pretention, and you'll get a dose of HARD CANDY. That's just what she did - a desperate, cash-in, sell-out ploy to set up her next global tour/merchandising juggernaut. As you try in vain to listen to each track, you find yourself pressing FAST FORWARD as they each evaporate before your ears until you're left with nothing...except the receipt from buying this CD. Worse than embarrassing, wholly irrelevant and straight-up plain ol' BAD.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I can't think of a single other movie which so brilliantly ties together industrialized, Western civilization through story and character. It doesn't matter what country you're from, or what language you speak. If you live in North America, western Europe, or Austrailia, you probably personally know a version of Shaun and each of his friends. I personally can't watch Shaun of the Dead without forgetting that there's a border between the US and Canada, an ocean between those two and the UK, and a planet between me and Austrailia/New Zealand. It has no politics, no preaching, and no culturally polarizing commentary. It's good-natured comedy, clever writing, and memorable acting. Because of these reasons, this is certainly in my own top 10 favorite movies of all time.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|The first question comes to mind: THIS took over a decade to produce? Not bad, not quite good, just hovering somewhere in the middle, THIRD is nice to finally have around but not close to essential, containing faded echoes of Portished's first two CDs, but now strips it down, roughs it up, and dims all the lights for an overall blacker flavor here. A darker, more sinister, even more mechanical brand of the Portishead we've all grown to love over the years. Some of these reviews are rather harsh. Their expectations are way too high. THIRD is more akin to Trip-Hop Comfort Food - exactly what you'd expect from the UK act taking it to its logical conclusion.  I actually like many of the more \\"rock\\" tracks like industrial-lite WE CARRY ON or rattling MACHINE GUN, but I am sure many won't. This will be the soundtrack to hotel barber shops, petit cafes, coffeehouses, and galleries circa 2008.
B000EQ47GS|3.0|A classic album of the 70's! Always had a great sound on vinyl and cassette! But, the modern age of recording shows it's flaws.  It was recorded at a home studio and now it shows. The producers had the gain up so high that you can now hear very clearly all of the slight audio overload and distortions. I can't figure why they didn't catch this when they were mastering the album for LP.
0060557818|4.0|This was not the allegorical novel I thought it would be. It was more in  the fantasy genre, a Harry Potter for adults. Once I realized that and just sat back to enjoy it as such, it was a good read. I'd actually read a sequel if one ever presented itself. Some of the character and world development is a bit thin for fantasy, though. I'd like Gaiman to spend some more time on this dark world and its inhabitants.
B00004SU5J|4.0|Tourist by St. Germain is one of those albums that I doubt I'll ever tire of.  Could have been a perfect album without weak tracks, \\"Montego Bay Spleen\\" and \\"What You Think About...\\" which in my opinion are just average.  Nonetheless, the album is great with the now classic \\"Rose Rouge\\", \\"Pont des Arts\\", and \\"La Goutte d'Or\\" topping out as my favorites.  Any fan of lounge music or electro-jazz should own a copy of Tourist.    4/5 stars
B000002JSH|5.0|I will now enter into the debate which was their best album,  this one or the Bad Co. debut but I like this one better personally,  it rocks more than the 1st album and has just a bit more intensity.  Still many of the songs on this release are highly recognizable today.  The ablum has stood the test of time even 33 years later.
0385338724|3.0|An original plot is what the book is missing. If you get the chance pick up the book, \\"Forget About It\\" by Caprice Crane. There are too many similarities between the books. \\"Remember Me?\\" wasn't a horrible book, but it felt like Kinsella didn't put a lot of effort into developing the characters.
0765318741|3.0|Good original story but the title was misleading,it should have said The Legend and other short stories,The story kind of left me hanging, I kept flipping back and forth until I realized the story was over and a new short story was beginning. The movie was better
0375424474|5.0|The physical condition of this book is great. It is a good looking, well sized hardcover with clear and easy-on-the-eyes print, and the pages themselves have a nice feel and look to them, all in all a great book.    As to what is written within you merely need to look at the other reviews.    Highly recommended.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There is no need for words.  This is the best t.v. series ever!  They HAVE to bring it back for another few seasons. NOW!!
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Will Smith is great as always. The graphics and sets are first rate. It is not the Omega Man with its new got ya appeal as when I was a kid. But the story was excellent and held me glued to the storyline until the end. The last 5 to 10 minutes left me with, did they run out of money, did they have something else to do, the writers quit? The word abrupt ending does not describe this ending. Over all it is worth a 5 star rating as it did catch me and I enjoyed the balance of the feature. Worth owning.
B00104QSOM|5.0|There will be blood is one of the best movies I've seen in the 2000's.  Daniel Day Lewis' acting in it is spellbinding.  Probally the greatest acting I've ever seen in a movie.  I just can't enough about how good this movie is.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. may not seem to fit the superhero archetype, but he is the quintessential TONY STARK! Downey is egotistical, edgy; both smug and smooth, comic book fans will quickly associate him with the flawed, sometimes less than heroic head of STARK Industries and IRONMAN himself. This isn't the only good bit of casting Gwyneth Paltrow is sooo perfect as the Moneypennyish Ms. (Pepper) Potts, Stark's personal assistant and unrequited love interest. Terrence Howard as Tony's right-hand-man Col. Rhodes (and War Machine in the future-sequel) is great as is Jeff Bridges as Stark Industries co-CEO and more (as the ominous poster would indicate).<br /><br />The 1963 Marvel comic, holds up well in the 21st century, the billionaire weapon-making industrialist, has a change of heart (sort of literally) after discovering his weapons aren't always used on just the bad guys. He reinvents himself (also, sort of literally) and returns home to more altruistic designs, but discovers he may have been betrayed.<br /><br />State-of-the-art FX contains some of the ultimate transforming sequences in which Tony Stark suiting-up never gets old (infinitely better than the NFL graphics). Equally cool are the aerial combat sequences with old Iron-head zipping `round pilots. The chrome-dome-computer-generated finale maybe one of the most clich&eacute;d moments, but even this is forgivable, next to so many other stand-out moments in which the film shines (including the perfect proclamation of Tony Stark in the films final moments! Starks ego is appropriately served!)<br /><br />Actor/ director Jon Favreau, who cameos amusingly enough, as Stark's driver, may have been a risky pick for such a huge property, especially without a notable hit-list. But, Favreau must be a fan or at least understands what comic fans want, as well as grasping the needs action/popcorn fare. Props to you Mr. Favreau, this AIN'T NO HULK! I can't wait for the sequel, with more drinking for Tony (no rehab research needed for Downey there) and more flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?<br /><br />Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!<br />Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!re flying for Rhodes.  Why not the Avengers, too?    Yes co-creator Stan Lee shows up, this time with an entourage!   Stay `till after the credits roll or you'll be furious....FURIOUS!!!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I think the movie is one of the best western ever made very good story line. Still a Classic of all the great western. The line I realy like is at the end of the movie. Some Day.
0812550706|5.0|My boyfriend got me this book (he loves sci-fi books) and I really loved it. I typically do not read a lot of science fiction, for example I never got into star wars or anything of the sort, granted I do appreciate it, but was just never a fanatic.   So I'm not going to bore anyone with an essay on this book I'm sure you time could be much better spent actually reading it!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|One night, I was fortunate enough to have stumbled upon a re-airing of this Jane Eyre version. The first few minutes already captured my attention.  But it was after the first encounter between Jane and Mr. Rochester that made me realize that there's something different about this version.    I haven't read the book, but I was always curious about JANE EYRE.  I tried watching other versions, but they all bored me.  I was never drawn to the characters until this version came along.  Ruth's Jane and Toby's Mr. Rochester had chemistry!    Some criticized this version for not being entirely true to the novel.  May I say to those individuals that not only did I purchase this DVD after watching the movie on PBS, I also bought the book.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|This was a quirky, sometimes difficult to understand expose of American greed and religious opportunity, flip sides of the same coin.  Still, the ending seemed contrived, overly symbolic and spoiled, for me anyway, an otherwise artistic, odd movie.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|This movie has an interesting plot. I love the acting by Brad Pitt and Bruce Willis. It really makes you think about the whole time travel aspect of messing things up.
0743496736|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed Jodi Picoult's books mostly for the fact that they make you think heavily about the issue presented.  NINETEEN MINUTES certainly did not stray from that and I am still thinking about it. She truly captures the issues surrounding bullying and the unfortunate consequences that can occur from the repeated tormenting of young people.  And while I would NEVER approve of anyone resorting to violence in order to settle their frustrations, Jodi Picoult paints a vivid picture of a boy who has been tormented and teased his whole life and just can't take it anymore.  You find yourself understanding Peter and feeling angry about the situations he faced and wondering why no one cared enough to intervene before the tragedy occured.  It's an sad reality of adolescence that most of us have faced in our lives and Jodi Picoult presents a well-written and accurate representation of his life that will leave you thinking for days. I highly recommend it.
B000286RKW|5.0|Martin Scorsese is one of my fav movie directors and Goodfellas is probably my favorite ganster movie (alongside with Godfather Part 1 and 2). Here De Niro delivers one of his best performances as an actor and this kind of character fit him so well. On Joe Pesci, this was the first time I saw him on a movie and I really did enjoy his impersonation as an \\"beyond good and evil\\" ganster. His \\"How Am I funny? Funny how?\\" Monolog it's one of the best twisted funny moments I have never saw on a movie. Finally, the brand new Ray Liotta as the main character and story teller is simply awesome. Later on he lost himself on some non trascendent movies. But anyway, Goodfellas is a hell of a kind movie. Five stars for sure!
B0000026KQ|2.0|Being new to Jeff Beck's music (Crossroads '07 video found me wanting to know more) and after listening to \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired,\\" I found this recording to very unredeeming. Over-Produced to the max.  It kinda sounds what a \\"garage\\" would look like. There are some great moments, but too few.  The rip-off of Zappa is very apparent, but Zappa it ain't.

B000ASATZ8|4.0|Our family has been fans of Tremors for years.  While sequels are never as good as the original, the silliness of this movie theme works well.  It's a great if you're a Tremors fan that must have them all!
0307265730|5.0|If you have read any of Lahiri's work, there is no need to elaborate. Although I found this bleaker than her other work, her writing is a pleasure.
0618135871|4.0|This does not have quite the cohesiveness of Roth's first David Kepesh book, \\"The Professor of Desire,\\" but is nevertheless a worthy read for the author's always subversive socio-cultural commentary and his always raw, always real, riffs on the deepest, darkest and most absurd depths of human sexuality---albeit mostly from the male perspective.  Aside from Roth's indisputable mastery of the language, his writing is always notable for its merciless candor as well as self-caricature.  He does not set out to create \\"sympathetic characters\\" for Chrissakes (leave that to all the cheesy Hollywood screenwriters) but REAL ones, who have their own internal rhyme and rhythm and are interesting in so far as they are often impenetrable...as are the best things in life.<br /><br />So much of the American psyche these days has been hopelessly distorted by the unholy confluence of radical feminism and puritannical Christianity, resulting in a fundamental confusion of sexuality with sexism, a one-dimensional insistence on seeing all sexual relations between men and women solely through the lens of power relations, and a technocratic, paternalistic attempt to prescribe and regulate the natural interplay between the sexes.  The traditional and admittedly oppressive gender roles have merely been replaced by NEW and equally oppressive, politically correct gender roles.<br /><br />The typical, zeitgeist-brainwashed person who hears that this book involves an affair between a sixty-something man with a twentysomething woman tends to cringe and leap to various distasteful conclusions.  However anyone who has the fortitude to read it with an open mind will easily see that it's actually more about death than sex, more about loss than lust, mortality than mammary glands.
B00139W3NE|5.0|The movie stayed faithful to the book in the way the Lord of the rings did. There were differences, but usually they made sense given the different presentation required for a movie. As for the story, well it is nice to have story line that is engaging and encourages children to explore their world, question establishment and the like.
B00008BXJG|5.0|While [[ASIN:B000089RV6 Back in Black]] probably is top to bottom a great album.  This has to be the best AC/DC album of all time.  There are at least 2 if not 3 songs on this album better than any on [[ASIN:B000089RV6 Back in Black]].  This is one of my favorite albums ever and I would recommend it to anybody.    If you like this album, [[ASIN:B00008WT5M The Razor's Edge]], [[ASIN:B00008BXJ6 High Voltage]], and [[ASIN:B000089RV6 Back in Black]] are AC/DC's other great albums and you will enjoy them too.  I'd also recommend [[ASIN:B00009MGR5 '74 Jailbreak]] because Jailbreak is a great song.
B000TSIK14|2.0|Another reviewer referenced this being like 1982 all over again.  That is absolutely nuts.  1982 was the year of the CLASSIC Blackout. If you think this sounds anything like that, or compares whatsover then your ears must be plugged. Not even close.  Unbreakable was closer to early 80s Scorps, this is more like later 80s..Savage Amusement. Personally this album leaves me more flat than ANYTHING they have ever done.  I point the finger one direction...the producer.  Desmond Child produces bleeding heart crap and much of this is no exception.  A couple of heavy riffs dont change how formulaic and lacking bite he made this album sound. It sounds to me like all the pieces were in place...(its the scorpions of course they were)...but they chose the wrong man to turn the knobs. I own everything the Scorps have ever done and listen to them all... I dont even mind Eye II Eye or Pure Instinct... but im baffled by the number of positive reviews here. A very generic, play it safe recording that has none of the soul touching vocals, soaring leads, or crushing heavy riffs I like about the Scorpions.  This sounds like a made for radio recording to me... but once again...thats what Desmond Child does...safe, sterile and boring.  The Scorpions are by far one of my favorite bands, but this is a bargain bin find at best and the last one in their catalog I recommend.

B000X1Z0BU|5.0|You've read about the story so I don't need to go into that. I just watched it for the 3rd time and each time it makes me smile. And the quietly effective performance of Marketa Irglova gets better and better with each viewing. Just saw their Swell Season concert and was WOWed by the live performance. They are so worth listening to and watching. Also from the film, I went to the website of the other Irish band in the film, INTERFERENCE. Bought their Live in Dingle CD and am equally WOWed by it. These Irish lads have kept themselves a secret far too long. Also bought SET LIST cd of The Frames (and 3 of their other CDs). These guys are brilliant, too! It's the band in which Hansard is the frontman. Set List is a live recording and the audience loves them. Buy them all....you'll love them, too. Best thing to come to America in years and years!
B0012BUX0I|4.0|\\"Rashomon\\" is, without any hint of doubt, one of the world's greatest motion pictures. One can go on and endlessly extol the marvel that is Akira Kurosawa, his technical prowess, the unparalleled cinematography which is still ground-breaking after 50 or so years, the theatrical acting led by Toshiro Mifune that effortlessly heightens the dreamlike tone of the film, and the unsolvable mystery of the tale by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. Or you can forever discuss who among the characters is telling the truth.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|If one were to reflect Paul Thomas (PT) Anderson's filmography to that of other directors I would have to say this:    'Boogie Nights' would be PT Anderson's Martin Scorsese's glitzy and glamarous gangster epics: 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino'. All three features long steadicam takes, raw and blunt Oscar worthy performances, 70's glamour setting, full of neon lights (true for both 'Boogie Nights' and 'Casino') and underrated protagonists (Mark Wahlberg, Ray Liotta and Bob De Niro)    'Magnolia' would be PT's attempt to be like his idol Robert Altman and this would be his \\"Short Cuts'. Taking place in a single location and 9 different people with their own individual lives that somehow are intertwined through divine intervention (death, raining frogs, freak accidents, etc.)    Finally, 'There Will Be Blood' can be viewed in many perspectives. It could be PT Anderson's take on a period piece - Scorsese style - 'Gangs of New York'. Hell, even Daniel Day Lewis' performance in that is just a rehearshal for this film. But I dare say it's more Terrence Malick's 'Days of Heaven'. 'There Will Be Blood' is biblically epic in proportion and filled with allusions to Christian themes.    Daniel Plainview can be viewed as a very flawed human being. A rouge and a knave no doubt, but still very much human with very human needs and desires. One can understand the pressure and the power that could bring about one's downfall. For a man to degenerate to that level of insanity at the end of the film goes to show how much money can be the root of evil and how it could corrupt the very essence of one's soul.     Daniel Plainview does not hesitate to murder anyone who gets in his way. By the end of the film, he had murdered two people (an imposter posing as his long lost brother and Eli Sunday, a devious bible-thumping scumbag). But he destroyed many more lives along the way. Most notable of all, his adopted son.     Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of the man is short of perfection. He can be too 'showy' at times and I believe he may have gone too far in his method acting. Paul Dano shines in playing two characters, both identical twins. His sermons were described as being fanatical bordering on dogmatic zealousness and also betrayal. Both characters' fates are intertwined with each other. Both were trying to rip each other off and by the end of the film, trying to literally 'screw' each other up. But of course, guess who got the upper hand?    Say what you will with about this film. Plainview is beyond redemption, so is Eli Sunday, as he remained incorrigible and devious right to the very end. This is one fine film with fine period detail and shots of wide plains of early 20th century America that harkens back to 'Days of Heaven'.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|Great DVD, starting right with the intro (Romeo and Juliet),  huge venue, neat effects, and that crazy directing that you expect from the muse DVD's leaves you liking songs you may not have liked before...
0756404746|5.0|I'm not eloquent enough to do this book justice.  It's fantastic. It's new. It's fresh.  It's beautiful and moving and heartbreaking and human.  It's believable. It's grounded. It's not pretentious. It's engaging, enjoyable, impossible to put down and simply marvelous.  Also, if you liked the book I highly recommend that you read Pat's blog.  He's hilarious.
B0000549B0|5.0|I haven't seen \\"Harvey\\" since it's VHS debut back in 1990.  What's surprising is what a multi-layered film it is.  On the surface it can be characterized as a screwball comedy about an iconoclast and his imaginary 6 foot 8 rabbit friend.  Sure the film has scads of hilarity.  What impressed me was it's sensitivity towards the mentally ill.  Elwood P. Dowd (James Stewart) is a genial sort but it's apparent that he is most definitely delusional and probably alcoholic.  1950 was not exactly the most politically correct of times but Mary Chase's Pulitizer Prize winning play from which the film's script is based is unusally in tune with the problems that people with mental illness face and it does so with great subtlety.  For that reason the film 58 years on does not date at all.  Stewart gives one of his patented great performances, a turn that is at once understated and sympathetic.  Josephine Hull deservingly won the Oscar for her work as Elwood's harried sister Veda, a role which in lesser hands could have bordered on the cliche.  For sure \\"Harvey\\" is mainly a comedy but it transcends mere labeling.  For that reason it is one the great American films of all time.

B00005JMFQ|1.0|My husband and I both hated this movie! There were way too many story lines pushed into a 2.5 hour movie. It was confusing trying to keep track of them all.<br />And the porn couple? A completely unneccesary story line! Are we to beleive that a couple who are completely naked around each other and have simulated sex are actually shy with each other and fall in love? Oh please. I couldn't have cared any less about them. They should have been left out of the movie entirely.<br />There was not enough depth given to ANY story line, and therefore, most of the movie was unbelievable. It wasn't a love story at all. It definitely wasn't a \\"feel good\\" movie that \\"warms your heart\\" like some reviewers have said. Nothing like we expected.<br />Another thing that was annoying was the music. At times, it was very out of place. It was as if they tried to put every great Christmas song in the movie, and it didn't all fit. At times it was too noisy and you couldn't hear them talking because of it.<br />One story line they didn't even finish. We just never saw the couple again!<br />If I could have given this movie 1/2 a star, I would have. The most unenjoyable movie I've seen in years. Completely horrible and a waste of time.

B0013FBS20|4.0|i do not usually like \\"will smith\\" movies, in which the watcher is usually predominantly aware of WILL SMITH instead of the plot and nuances of the film itself.  but this movie was strange and sad and not about will smith (although he was basically the only character throughout most of it.)
B000MQ54OY|1.0|I bought the Blu-ray version of this movie after reading a positive  review in a home theater magazine.  This movie was so un-involving that  I quit watching it after about 30 minutes.  Furthermore, its story is a crass,   unrelenting manipulation of its audience's pity for underdogs, environmental  abuse, the disabled, the downtrodden, etc. ad nauseum.  This is a pity party  on a grand scale!    \\"Happy Feet\\" is not good enough to warrant a discussion of its technical  merits (Blu-ray video and audio).  In fact, it would be charitable to  say that the characters in Happy Feet are two dimensional (as opposed  to three dimensional).  It is difficult to care about what they are  doing or saying.  They never jump off the screen and become real to the  viewer.    Then there is the music.  What a disappointment!  Audiences have become  accustomed to the wonderful soundtrack music of movies like \\"The Lion  King,\\" \\"Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella\\" (TV 1997), and \\"Monster's Inc.\\"   What we get instead with \\"Happy Feet\\" is unsophisticated, artless, and  often crude, especially so for a children's movie.  At best, the music  is un-involving, at worst repugnant.    Don't waste your money on \\"Happy Feet\\" just to get a Blu-ray children's  movie.  In fact, just don't waste your money on it at all.

B000GY729M|2.0|With most bands, the sophomore effort isn't as good as the first. The Killers are poster children for a less than stellar sophomore album. While I wasn't expecting \\"Hot Fuss v. 2.0\\", I was expecting the same level of awesome, if you will. Unlike Hot Fuss which was refreshing and memorable, this is rather dull and forgettable. One word that keeps coming mind to describe this album is \\"themed\\". All the tracks seem to related somehow; they all sound the same. They seem to just blend together. It's so boring that with as many times as I've listened to it, none of the songs really stick out to me. I'm honestly surprised I can even sing along to any of the songs. You're much better off just sticking with \\"Hot Fuss\\" and \\"Sawdust\\".
1416955070|3.0|Not amazing, not terrible. I'm not sure why it received so many bad reviews. I thought overall it was a decent read and found it enjoyable. I would recommend readers avoid it though just due to the terrible plot twist that comes out right at the end.
B00004XONN|5.0|I'll make this short as so many people have nailed the amazing aspects of this album.<br /><br />Radioheads sound changed on a large scale in only a few years. They became a<br />Post-Rock Electronic band with a majority of the songs zeroing in on the sound and flow of things.<br /><br />The songs are well produced and very technical. The album is worth double the price in my opinion and will remain a constant in my playlists for ages to come.
B0015AARJI|5.0|What's not to like about the most popular controller of the past decade. It has the classic feel of a PS controller w/ rumble and a fully functional SIXAXIS. You'll be surprised how much sturdier it feels than the SIXAXIS wireless controller.  I love the way they've integrated bluetooth technology - It is VERY responsive.  If I had one complaint, it would be the price but that's no big deal either.
B000002I2M|5.0|This is The Doors final studio album, by this point good old Jim had garnished a beard and held a fatigued singing voice. The band oddly enough went in reverse cycle for rock bands of the era, reverting back to a bluesy sound as oppose to a harder more rockish tone.<br /><br />The song selection is top notch, L.A. Women the song was another long Doors single frequently played. L'America's ever progressing speed creates an illusion of anxiety... It just keeps building up! Some bizarre songs shift into play here such as the coiling \\"Crawling King Snake\\" and the worn out sounding  'Hyacinth House'. 'Love Her Madly' classically restores The Doors popish capabilities following the strict Verse Chorus Verse Chorus Bridge Chorus format, rendering it ideal for radio play.<br /><br />All the songs are wonderful for a closing album, this is a must buy for classic rock fans or Doors enthusiasts.
0790734850|4.0|An interesting and unique noir thriller that kept me watching until the very end.  I thought it to be a perfect picture of the novel, some changes here and there, but still wonderful, and definitely worth the buy, something every noir film lover should have.  Every one a fan of dectective films as well will love this movie.<br /><br />Keven Spacey, Kim Bassinger, Russel Crowe emblazon the scenes as hard nosed and wise cracking and defiant leads and immaculate skill as actors, they embody their characters, and empower the film in the process.  Guy Pearce as the straight laced cop is excellent and though flat and sometimes predictable, he definitely makes good with what he has.  Danny Devito was born to play the Sleazy Entertainer Tabloid Journalist willing to do anything for a story, the paparazzi of the fifties.  This was was certaintly a masterpiece, a work of unique and entertaining genuis... BUY IT NOW.
0375842209|5.0|That phrase is a cliche but in this case, it truly fits.  This is a fantastic book, beautifully written and deeply moving.    I can see how some people might find it slow.  I usually prefer fast-paced books but the metaphors and language in this were so wonderfully done, I didn't mind.  The character development is excellent...very well-rounded characters, very detailed.  By the end of the book, I didn't want to let go of them.    The book is emotional, I have to say.  I used up more than one kleenex on it.    Bravo to the author.  I loved it.

The book cover and pages were not welcoming, but after starting to read it felt like you are in a good place for conversation, and that it is well worth your time to listen.    For example:  1. Which friend to take with you to a party?      The answer: he'd better be similar but inferior in some aspect     (a -a b)  2. How our stand on issues is determined?      The answer: it is highly sensitive to inital conditions.    I take it with me even to the beach to share with friends the newly set or newly phrased insights to how we behave.

B0014KD46W|4.0|I've liked Steve Winwood through most of his career, including Blind Faith, Traffic, and his solo music.  I'm not as much a fan of the pop tunes as I am the jazzier, bluesier music.      The single of \\"Dirty City\\" a gritty Blind Faith style number with his old friend Eric Clapton led this CD out into radioland.  It's my favorite cut of the collection and the reason I bought the CD.      \\"Fly\\" is lovely.  The flute at the end of the song is compelling and really conjures up the image of flight.     I'd like to see \\"At Times we Forget\\" get some airplay. It's got strong lyrics and is a good listen.     Check out the samples on this page and see what you think.  While this CD is mostly jazz and blues influenced, fans of Winwood's pop may find a few cuts they really enjoy--and the price for this collection is excellent.

B0000C8AVR|5.0|What is there left to say about Highway 61 Revisited that hasn't already been said?  As the United States of the twenty-first century willfully dives into the hole of its own making, let us remember the things that have made us truly great as a culture.  One of those is the collected works of Bob Dylan, and of those works, Bringing It All Back Home stands near the pinnacle.  Just looking over the track list is an excursion into the soul of the modern age.  Everything is there.  I can't analyze it all in an Amazon review.  By this time almost too much has been written about Dylan, but it's all there when you listen to the words and the music together.  All I can say is at very end of the very last song.    Right now I can't read too good  Don't send me no more letters no  Not unless you mail them  From Desolation Row      Listen and you'll find it.
B000EOTAM6|4.0|I went into this film with extremely low expectations.  I used to watch the animated Aeon Flux series which was very well done, if not somewhat confusing.  Bringing Aeon Flux to the big screen actually IMPROVES upon the original.  The film fleshes out the the story/history of Aeon Flux and actually makes the entire premise understandable.  This film was an enjoyable ride with some interesting special effects, some were good, some were lacking (I found all the blood in the film very fake).  Overall, this film is a good watch for anyone interested in sci-fi (even if not totally original).  The film stands on its own without any viewing of the animated series.  Four stars = above average.  Aeon Flux gets a well deserved four stars.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|It has been many years now, since Testament released a new record and I have been impatiently waiting for it. I listen to their music since their first album \\"The Legacy\\" and have all subsequent releases. \\"The Formation of damnation\\" sounds to me like the \\"original\\" Testament style found between \\"The New Order\\" and \\"The ritual\\". Most songs are grooving mid-tempo and the riffs are great as always. Chuck's vocals are much less \\"Death Metal\\"-like as on the more recent albums. In fact, I think that the Testament community had been split in the past years into those that prefer Testament's \\"old-school\\" style, which is very much dominating here, and those that prefer the more recent albums \\"Low\\", \\"Demonic\\" and \\"The Gathering\\", which are substantially harder. The latter ones will probably critisize this release as a step back, because it certainly it goes \\"back to Testament's\\" roots. Those, however, which liked the original style more, will probably love \\"the Formation of Damnation\\". Objectively, although I like all the work of Testament very much, I think that this album is not their strongest release. It can neither really compete with \\"The new order\\" (more old-school) or with \\"The Gathering\\" (more \\"modern\\"). However, these two albums are among the best trash albums ever and it might be somewhat unfair to compare everything against this very high standard. Altogether, this record is worth the money, it is a must for Testament fans, it is a solid mid-tempo trash album, but it is not outstanding.
B000E41MRC|5.0|To begin with, merely discussing this film in open society, or among those conversant with film history and theory, often serves as the beginning of arguments rivalled only by mentioning Birth of a Nation.  Attempting to review the film can only compound the problem.  So, one must look at Riefenstahl's film in light of what it intends to accomplish, and how effective it is in doing so.  To answer the first question, any film that attempts to rationalize National Socialism is morally questionable, to say the least.  However, did Riefenstahl know this at the time this film was made?  The evidence would argue that she didn't.  While she couldn't have been unaware of the anti-Jewish rhetoric of the Nazi party, she may very well have been unaware of the extremity of that political party's ethnic hatred.  Riefenstahl was commissioned to produce a celluloid document that would contribute to the cultural standing of the Nazis, and she did exactly that in her depiction not only of Hitler as a \\"god\\" descending from the heavens to rescue Germany, but also through the sheer power of the sequences in which masses of soldiers move in exact synchronization.  Through images pastoral and industrial in origin, Riefenstahl weaves a tapestry that, for the moment of viewing, comes within a hair's breadth of achieving what the Nazis desperately wanted:  acceptance by the world outside Germany.  The cinematic accomplishment of Triumph of the Will can be noted by one barometer:  The film was considered to be so effective in its method and argument that it was banned from exhibition in the U.S.A. during the Second World War.  Now, Riefenstahl's film was not alone in receiving this distinction; many lesser, more heavy-handed (and offensive) films were also banned during wartime.  However, one only has to look at two of the most popular films of all time to determine just how influential Triumph of the Will really is.  In George Lucas' Star Wars (Episode IV, for the newbies), the entire sequence in which the heroes are awarded their medals is \\"appropriated\\" from Triumph of the Will, even down to the replication of Albert Speer's \\"Cathedral of Light\\" which was created around the stadium at Nuremburg using huge flood lights.  Following that, Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings trilogy used Triumph of the Will as an obvious reference in the depiction of the mustering and marching of the Orc troops against the heroic defenders of Middle Earth.  So where does this leave us?  Is this film the virtual capture of evil on film?  Yes...and no.  It is a fact beyond dispute that the Third Reich epitomized evil during the mid-20th century, and any form of media which attempts to argue on its behalf is tainted by such an association.  However, it is unfair to penalize Leni Riefenstahl for doing exactly what she was directed to do.  What many people seem to be unable to accept is that she was willing to bring all of her cinematic acumen to bear upon such a project.  It is difficult to reconcile the director of Olympia with that of Triumph of the Will.  However, one must constantly remind oneself of Riefenstahl's commitment, as a documentarist, to capture the moment which is occurring before her cameras.  As such, she cannot be held accountable for the ultimate effect of Triumph of the Will; this is simply an example of a director doing a job a bit too well.  Still, no-one should simply sit back and view this film without the guidance of history.  To do so, to accept the arguments of the film's \\"stars\\" without question, would be to declare defeat in the face of an evil which should have been wiped from the face of the Earth decades ago.  In short, this film is an invaluable resource of technique.  Morally, it is beyond redemption.  This moral failing is not the fault of the director.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I can say that i was very hesitant when I first heard that Madonna was delivering a hip-hop album; the rap in American Life scares me still today.  But once I knew that Star Trak and Timbaland would be involved, that resistance turned into anticipation.  And now the finished product is finally here.  While I initially prepared to hear something I might not like, Madge (or M-Dolla these days) delivered.  All songs are keeperes as both a Madonna fan and a hip-hop fan, but what does stand out?  The lyrics never hit me as inspired as I have had in the past.  Madonna uses the same range throughout, sounding as she did 20+ years ago. While I loved the production, I would ask that pharell, and maybe even Justin, would keep it down a bit and just produce - to be more frank, did we have to hear their voices on every track they produced?  I dont recall Paul Oakenfold spitting shoutout on confessions.  Anyway, any Madonna fan would love, and with this release she will be sure to pick up the next generation of fans as she moves beyond the Warner Bros relationship to the next conglomerated medium through LiveNation.
0143038419|5.0|Dear Ms. Gilbert,  I hope you will read this. Just want to say that your book is amazing. I'm originally from Russia and I am so glad that  Eat, Pray, Love is translated  into Russian, so I can recommend it to all my friends.  You make people happy. Thank you.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|This CD is completely crapp musically, melodically, vocally and lyrically...the unpleasant cover photo is also one of the factors that contributes to somebody hesitating to buy the album. As for Justin Timberlake, he is the overrated/lousiest song writer/producer/artist ever in the music industry...and Madonna teaming up with him is nothing but a big joke. I would have given a zero star review if only I could. I own all her previous albums and singles but will definitely skip this one as this is not a Madonna album to me. For those who provided a five star review, it is time for an ear treatment and be truthful...please don't mislead other potential buyers.
B0001I562I|5.0|i had seen the movie before.  i found it to be funny suspenceful and very intertaining  my 4 year old nephew fell in love with it and we had to watch it 3 times in a row. its good for all ages
B000058983|1.0|This review is for people who are thinking of buying their first Love album and want to get an idea if they should take a chance.  I'm offering an opposing opinion to the many cult members whould like to give Love 10 stars.  I am reviewing two albums here.  I heard LITTLE RED BOOK, ALONE AGAIN OR, LIVE AND LET LIVE, and YOU SET THE SCENE forty years ago.  I wanted to hear them again  So I bought LOVE and FOREVER CHANGES, hoping to hear even more good music.  What I got for the price of two CDs were the four songs I wanted (very good songs that stand the test of time), a lot of lame flower power folk rock from LOVE, and a prelude to psychadelic music and lyrics from FOREVER CHANGES  This is of historical value, but only 3 good song here.  Here's a reason to get an MP3 player.  Download those four songs for $3.96, and you will have The Best of Love  Love was an important, influential group in the 60's but thay are also a product of those times. The songs sre irrelevant to today's listeners.  Ask my daughter. It's to bad Love wasn't able to evolve into better musicians and grow wit the times.   But I've been stuck in the sixties too long.  I want hear new music.  Because most of music is weak and dated, I don't reccomend it. There is far better music fom that era.      P.S.  Love's thin vocals and some of their songs remind me of the group named Spirit, and their album THE TWELVE DREAMS OF DR SARDONICUS  This a a much better album that FOREVER CHANGES.  It is timeless,[[ASIN:B000002AF2 Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus]] and it still has meaning today  If insist on 60's music, Spirit is a unique high quality group
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|Epica has done it again, a fantastic album.  The band seems to take the term symphonic in symphonic metal literally, and they really pull it off perfectly.    I can understand why some previous reviewers don't enjoy Mark's grunts, though I don't share their opinion.  Metal vocalists can really go either way when it comes to whether someone likes or dislikes them; it's a matter of personal taste.  If you're not sure, check them out on You Tube (they have plenty of videos there) and hear for yourself.    I find him fantastic, actually, and hope he never gives it up!  He and Simone go great together, to my taste at least.  Keep it up, guys!    Also, as for the implied complaint that they sound like Nightwish, I disagree.  The only things Nightwish and Epica have in common is they are both symphonic metal bands and they both have female and male vocalists.  Their styles are very distinctly different.
B000YABYLA|4.0|While this was a little quirkier than most movies I watch, I did enjoy this a lot.  It was a great story line and acted really well by ALL the cast.  While Ellen Page was very good here, I thought some of the supporting actors were better still.  Jennifer Garner was great as Vanessa - the wife in the couple wanting to adopt a baby.  I thought she was as charming as ever.  Her husband, played by Jason Bateman was also great as a man with doubts about where he is in life.  Juno's friend (the father of the baby) Paulie Bleeker was one of the best actors here.  He was very supportive of Juno and whatever her decision was going to be.  It was also good that Juno had a very supportive father and step-mother, as is not always the case in movies with teenage pregnancy.  I must admit, the soundtrack was totally boring and awful, but the acting on all sides made up for that.  Everyone did a superb job and it truly is a feel good movie that really does make you feel good.  I'm glad I saw it, and while it may not be the kind of movie I'd watch 100 times, I'd certainly see it again over time and love it more each go.
0525950079|5.0|I loved PILLARS OF THE EARTH, so my expectations for this follow-up were high.  OK, I'm not completely finished, but so far it is just as compelling and satisfying as the earlier tome.  There are those exciting, big scenes of death and disaster juxtaposed with honest, emotional sequences, and the pages keep turning.  I'm a professional scriptreader and am pretty picky/bookwormy/nerdy  about what I read on my own time.  This book (as well as its predecessor) is smart enough to engage my mind and readable enough to qualify as relaxation.  A coup.  I'm only sorry that it comes to an end after only 1,000 pages!!!
B00169XU8I|5.0|There are plenty of pleople who have poured their heart and souls into reveiwing these albums. I'm not going to try to compete. As a HARD CORE Madonna fan for over 25 years, I'm happy to see she's evolved in some ways and found her way back to where we happily found her. ON the DANCE FLOOR.  Where all good-little-madonna-groupies belong!! I normally take at least a few listens to ANYTHING to warm up to it, but a few were instant faves and the rest clicked after the first listen. I'm not going to tell you she's broken all new ground here. She please us, presented and delivered your quinessential Madonna pop album. All Hail!! Keep it coming! i'm working hard to bring my three daughters up on your music (not too hard) we have daily dance parties and they can recognize any song. I'm such a proud mum :)
B000FFJYCU|4.0|GRAND PRIX was one of director John Frankenheimer's big-budget spectacles, filmed by MGM in Cinerama, its super-wide screen nicely restored for this DVD.  Brilliant split screen effects and camera movements and the rare appearance of Antonio Sabato, plus actual racing footage using well known racers including Damien Hill, make this an unforgettable experience.  The melodramatic plot is a bit slack, but the overall effect is sensational.
0205313426|5.0|I bought my first copy of The Elements of Style in 1982. Now over 26 years later I have found my old college friend. The laws of good writing have not changed and one only gets better at it. A must have book for anyone who cares about what they write.
B000005L86|5.0|Seriously, this one brings me to tears every time.  This is art for the ages.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|I agree with many of all these less-than-impressed reviews of this movie.  I am really getting tired of how todays films depend so much on CGI.  It's just not perfected yet.  It still looks way too cartoonish which is very hard to take seriously.  I miss the sci-fi horror films of the 1980's.  Creating special effects WITHOUT CGI looked more realistic on film back then.<br /><br />And what's more.  I have yet to see any Will Smith film worth watching twice.  He does \\"big budget\\" films, but they are generally all pretty lame in appeal.  His \\"Wild Wild West\\", \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Men in Black\\", \\"I Robot\\", etc.  These are just a few of some pretty lame big box office Hollywood films.<br /><br />\\"Hitch\\" didn't have any CGI, so I guess what made that film bad was just Will Smith himself.  Well, wait a minute.  It's not that I don't like Will Smith.  I just don't like any of his films.  Any actor could have replaced him in all those films of his, and it will still be an overblown, but still dull movie to me.  I guess I just don't care for his choices in his movie career.  But, I guess he's not hurtin'.  America eats this crap up.
B000089RV6|5.0|I ordered as a replacement for a lost copy.  I hope the quality is as good as the original.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I really don't know what all the hype was about for this movie, I of course got suckered into renting it, what a waste of money!! This movie is filmed as if the person is filming with a camcorder, yes all the bouncing and shaking that goes on with it and through the entire movie!!<br />Within the first 10 minutes I got a major headache from all the shaking and bouncing around going on. I thought that maybe it would only be this way for the first few minutes then break into a regular format, but unfortunately it did not.<br />I actually jumped forward to several scenes and eventually to the end to see if it would change...still no change. I finally got fed up and turned it off because at this point my head was pounding and I was quite annoyed and dissapointed. This would have been a decent movie had it been shot in a normal format. I wish that there was some way to know if a movie is filmed this way beforehand and not have to find out the hard way after renting it, there should be a warning on the cover of the movie jacket.I suggest not to waste your time on this one.

B000OT6V00|5.0|This is an amazing transfer to BD.  Far superior to the dvd.  Could've wished for more extras, but overall, a pleasure to watch.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This simple \\"romantic comedy\\" is so wrought with life, love and sensitivity, it's no wonder Diablo Cody won the Oscar for her brilliant script. Ellen Page is perfect, as a youth who has seen enough to know how to handle things. Allison Janney is excellent, as is everyone else. Previous reviewers can wring out all kinds of angst about the situations involved, but I think Jason Reitman's presentation is the best teen film in years. There's a minimum of gross-out humor, as in most teen films, but almost everything that comes out of Ms. Page's mouth is worth listening to...thanks to Ms. Cody. There's absolutey no meanness, or ugliness or mean-spirit to take away from the love that abounds. I enjoy this film a lot. If you don't, lighten up...
0965604926|3.0|Although Iris Chang, the author of \\"The Rape of Nanking,\\" created a well written historical novel, his explanation of the rather horrible event is somewhat graphic and repetitive. The chapters all explained the same event from many different points of view regarding the Japanese attack on the city of Nanking and participation during the Cold War. Some included more detail than others. However, the facts and information remained steadfast, interesting, and appealing. It was somewhat fascinating to learn how far the Japanese were willing to go in order to take over a city, something that had been planned for most of their lives. It was a fairly easy read and extremely straightforward. I found it surprising that the book and its historical context and connection to a \\"forgotten holocaust\\" was actually engaging.<br /> The back cover explanation of this novel persuaded me to believe that it was about the gruesome Japanese attack on a Chinese city. While it did outline and incorporate the details of the assault, the book went farther behind the scenes. It revealed the reasons for, the affects upon, and individual accounts. If you simply want the basic facts about the \\"rape of Nanking,\\" then I strongly do not recommend this book. If you would rather read about the history leading up to this event, the affect upon the entire human race, the shameless soldiers, or the scar that never healed in and around Asia, then this book is for you. Personally, I think that Iris Chang went beyond writing \\"a definitive history of this horrifying episode.\\"
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|I did not find out about this young man until I listened to a \\"Roots\\" album.

I was thinking, what if he was a mainstream producer?? Then again, I don't think his craft and talent would be appreciated by the masses!<br /><br />I know he will and is missed. Thank you God for the talent you blessed this young man with!<br /><br />Can anyone tell me the original singers of the track U-Love???..matter of fact..the original performers of his samples.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|I guess blood is appropriated in the movie of betrayal, revenge, and cannibalism among the other things.  Benjamen Barker (Johnny Depp in his third Oscar Nominated performance) comes back to London after being falsely imprisoned by the corrupt judge (Alan Rickman) who wanted him out of the way, so he could steal his wife and daughter. He goes back to his old profession under the name Sweeney Todd as a barber but his purpose of life is to take revenge of the judge. Before he finally gets to the judge, Todd masters the shaving skills on dozens (maybe hundreds) of customers, becoming The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.  Todd's neighbor and accomplice Mrs. Lovett helps him to get rid of the corpses at the same time improving greatly the taste and quality of her meat pies for sale that soon become the hottest item in London.<br /><br />Who else but Tim Burton could adapt this material to the screen? As we would expect in his films, he does his usual admirable job with dark gothic sets and art direction (Oscar winning). Staging, production design, costumes, editing, cinematography are impressive and create gloomy and doomed mood.  Johnny Depp and Helena Bohnam Carter both did very good job not just acting but also singing in the film. Depp has gotten high praises for his performance and was nominated for many awards but I found Carter's performance most interesting and her character most memorable.<br /><br />The loyal fans of the original musical praise the songs and the very specific darker than dark sense of humor. While I agree that whatever songs have made it to the movie were melodically interesting enough, hard as I tried it was difficult to find humor in Burton's version. What was easy to find - enormous amount of blood gushing from the screen \\"in your face\\" in the very realistic manner, preceded by numerous throats slicing. Blood overwhelmed everything and everybody on the screen. Blood is the thing that I remember distinctly. Yes, I got the point. Sweeney Todd was the barber, and his specialty was to give his clients too close of the shave but did Burton really need all that blood?  I am sure everyone got the point after the first throat slicing and certainly after the second. After that - all the bloodshed became boring, tedious, and disgusting. I guess, Tim Burton needed it so, he \\"could reflect on the horrors he had invented\\".  I've been always a subscriber to the opinion that \\"Implied is so much better than literal\\". The scariest monster or the most horrific murder is the one that we never see, the uncertainty is the scariest monster of all and as long as we don't see it we picture it in our imagination and get scared of what we imagine. Once the monster is for us to see (especially as many times as in the movie), it is not scary anymore, it is laughable, and it loses whatever impact it was supposed to make, at least on this viewer.his specialty was to give his clients too close of the shave but did Burton really need all that blood?

B00004ST9Q|4.0|Yeah, Whitney for real in her prime. Whitney displays all her vocal ability in this DVD.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who is into Whitney.<br />She is a real top performer on any given day and her range of vocal ability makes her standout from so many other performers from the 1990's.
B0000009SM|5.0|I agree with the prior reviews - this is his best, and that fact was driven home to me with authority when I saw \\"Zappa does Zappa\\" last year.  I was so glad that Dweezil pulled as much as he did from this album.  The lineup is one of (if not the) best that Frank ever had, and the tunes reflect the Zappa musical genius at its finest.  (Although if I may disagree with others here, my favorite guitar solo is the \\"Baby Snakes\\" version of Punky's Whips, or maybe it's the Zombie Woof solo off \\"Cheap Thrills\\", but I digress.)  Every tune is solid, if not indispensible, and the chops on every band member shine through.  How more people don't absolutely love this stuff blows my mind...(oh that's right, American Idol is what passes for music in this ever increasingly ignorant America we live in.)  Well written, well arranged, well played, and well worth your musical money.
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I'm not a long-time REM fan, but have admired their music over the past ten years.  I have a few of their albums, and this one is one of my favorites; if you like smart lyrics and catchy tunes, this one is for you...
0143038419|1.0|i was lent this book from my best friend that i adore - it was her favorite.  it couldn't be bad right?  fast forward to me wanting to stick a sharp object in my own eye to end the pain of reading this book.  if you want to experience whining about nothing, this is the book for you.  i finally had to admit to my friend that i hated the book and the woman in it.  she told me to skip to the bali part of the book (the last third) and it did get a little better (we had vacationed there before).  but i think that was because she finally stopped complaining about nothing which made it more tolerable.  i would say all men, before entering a relationship with a woman, ask if she liked this book and then go running if she did.  except for my best friend of course!

0978607651|5.0|Endless inspiration. This is the work of a true genius. The colors, the presentation, fabulous. The only problem is that the book is so large and wide it's hard to turn the pages. Still I look thru it on a weekly basis.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I have been a die hard Madonna fan since her emergence on the music scene in the 80's.  I expected so much more from this \\"Final\\" album on her current label. There are only two songs on this album that are any good. '4-minutes' and 'The Beat goes on'. The others are Madonna trying desperatly to hip-hop and straining to sound like an authentic singer. Neither of which she was successful. 'Incredible' is simply abhorant. As we were listening we had to skip it midway, as it was incredibly terrible. I was hoping she would leave the label with a bang, instead she album fizzled and lacks any spark. :(
B0000025T6|5.0|The atmospheric sound of this classic album is made up of only voice, guitar and harmonica. The stories are told in compelling imagery over stately melodies. Although the sentiment is deeply melancholic, the promise of redemption is never entirely absent. Places like Lincoln, Atlantic City, Ohio, Michigan, New Jersey, Johnstown, Wyoming and Linden Town provide the setting for these tales of nostalgia, trouble and heartbreak.<br /><br />If you've seen the 1973 movie [[ASIN:0790739240 Badlands]] (Sissy Spacek and Martin Sheen) you'll have a more profound understanding of the title track. Both it and Mansion on the Hill are slow and mournful whilst Atlantic City has a lilting beat and Johnny 99 is edgy with its nervous guitar riffs that also infuse State Trooper, a song that thematically relates to Highway Patrolman.<br /><br />Springsteen's characteristic car and road imagery surfaces in Used Cars with its poignant childhood recollections as well as in Open All Night, an uptempo rock song, the only one on the album. The line \\"radios jammed up with gospel stations, lost souls callin' lost distance salvation\\" reminds me of Far Away Eyes by the Stones, a tongue-in-cheek country song on [[ASIN:B000007SL7 Some Girls]]. For some reason, it also makes me think of [[ASIN:0143037714 Hank Williams]].<br /><br />Guilt, remorse and the yearning for redemption are expressed in vivid oneiric imagery on the haunting track My Father's House. Reason to Believe concludes this outstanding album on an uplifting note with the observation that people ultimately do find meaning. It echoes a similar hope earlier expressed in Atlantic City, the notion that perhaps everything that dies someday comes back. Its simplicity, profundity and power make Nebraska a masterpiece and a highly influential work.
B00005JPS7|5.0|This movie was everything that I had hoped for. Once again a Marvel   comic book hero has made a good movie. Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent  job of portraying Iron Man(Tony Stark). Tony Stark is the CEO of Stark  Industries who manufactures weapons. He is in Afghanistan when his  helicopter is blown from the air and he is captured. He is held hostage  by al-Quaida terrorists. He is ordered to construct a Jericho missile.  On the sly he builds an Iron Man suit. It has weapons and flies at supersonic speeds. He stages a daring escape. He also suffers heart damage during his capture. He comes up with an instrument to help with this condition. He returns to America and fine tunes his invention. He decides to use his invention to fight the forces of evil. Jeff Bridges  plays his business mentor and pardner who is trying to take his company away from him. They wind up in a pitched battle. The special effects used by Iron Man are breathtaking and fabulous. This is a must see movie. The  scene after the credits adds to the dimension of the movie. A fantastic movie.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I had never heard of this group.  My first impression was pretty good and after hearing them for a bit I started to like them a lot more.<br /><br />I know nothing of their musical background or how they came together, but to my ears, it made me think a little bit of techno and Abba with a hint of a retro calypso vibe.  I know it sounds weird, but that's the first thing that came to mind.<br /><br />Their aptly named \\"Oracular Spectacular\\" is just that.  A treat for jaded ears and worth getting to know.<br /><br />What a great soundtrack they could create for a movie!  Be it thriller, romance or adventure.  When I hear the music I see images.  And that's good.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|This album is like nothing I've seen or heard. My first reaction was \\"oh, that hurt\\", as I got a headache just trying to comprehend it all. The initial track on the album \\"Time to Pretend\\" sounds rather euphoric and dissonant, like someone was on an acid trip when they thought it up. Well, when you actually see their music video for this song, it all becomes rather clear and apparent. I like the retro modern feel of it all. It makes you feel like someone put the 1990's and 1960's in a blender and added a few helpings of crack-laced vodka for feel. Not for everyone, but if you \\"don't mind experimenting\\" and are \\"open to new things\\", whatever that might mean, I think it's an album that you might enjoy.
0151008116|1.0|This is the first novel I have read in a long while that has caused in me such a strong negative reaction. It is not so much the narrative, which I found in turn tedious, preposterous and then duplicitous, but the message which was highly disturbing if not abhorrent. I am dismayed by the many positive reviews it has received.    Many here have expressed their concerns and criticisms far more adroitly than I can, so I'll just point you to them with a few judicious quotes from their reviews.    Shran : \\"Postmodernism at its worst\\"   WhatNow: \\"This book has all the grace and purpose of a snuff film\\"   Inquiring Mind: \\"Silence of the Lambs meets Sophies Choice\\"   (although this last places the book with company it does not deserve to keep)    My own summary: gratuitous gore, tedious detail, duplicitous plot line and a philosophy that should be taken out and shot at dawn.
B000Y7U98C|4.0|What would happen if you combined themes / motifs from movies like [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:6305222916 Event Horizon]] and [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]]?  Well, the film might look something like SUNSHINE.<br /><br />The plot is that some 50 yrs in the future (or so) the sun is dying.  This, of course, leaves the earth as a freezing block of ice (kinda like what's foretold in the Viking legends of eschatology / the end-of-the-world).  A brave crew is embarked on a journey to \\"jump start\\" the sun so it can continue on @ least a few more million yrs.  Needless to say, the very future of life on earth is at stake.<br /><br />The ship, we find out, is actually the 2nd attempt at accomplishing this mission.  The first ship disappeared w/out a trace after getting close to the sun.  If you're keeping score @ home, there is an avenue for a subplot here!  The mission leads to the astronauts having to face a series of heart-wrenching ethical decisions that they must deal with in order to accomplish their task.<br /><br />If you're into sci-fi flicks, this one is certainly worth giving a look to.  It's not really the kind of science fiction flick that's bound to attract very many people who aren't into sci-fi, but that's OK.  Just one thing if you decide to pick up this DVD:  be sure to put your sunglasses on before you begin watching it.  Things are gonna get hot!
B000R5N1MC|5.0|Expensive, but this edition contains the only version  on DVD of the original theater version of the movie.  Also, the \\"final\\" final cut is interesting, as are the  special features.

B000026FOA|5.0|Pink Moon was dark as they come, but Five Leaves Left, despite others saying it is the most depressing of the three, or some other stuff, it's like an autumn morning.  Or a dark night on the river.  It's also longer, and features more than just the guitar.  Nothing is as naked as Pink Moon, but Five Leaves Left is beautiful, and, if you have the ears, becomes apparent with the first seven seconds of The Thoughts of Mary Jane (though to me it seems about drugs).<br /><br />Five Leaves Left takes me on a journey to the rivers, forests, star-filled sky, and sunsets (sometimes with a girl on my side, sometimes not). Drake's lyrics, as always, are filled with lyrics of hope , depression,  life.  Sometime, I really need to take a music based journey to the places that conjure in my mind.  Really experience the music (actually, you all should, NOW). That's a testament that how, some music, can really be more than just a mere listen.<br /><br />I think I would stop right now, because Five Leaves Left has been described just by that last paragraph.  Man this review was crappy! While not as good as other albums, some albums, even if they aren't the greatest to exist, just cannot be said with justice (at least my attempt at it). Shows when you try to review albums you really just can't explain.  Just. Listen.<br /><br />9/10
B000002LRX|5.0|When this album came out I was a manager of a Record Store. I remember the entire staff wanted to play it, which meant skipping several tracks, so as not to offend any customers that might be in the store. A deep complex album. I believe it to be the best album of the decade. Faith No More attacks every aspect of society with great contempt. This album blows 'EPIC' away. 'Land of Sunshine', 'RV' , 'Kindergarten' and 'Be Aggressive' are my favorites. This album contains no radio friendly tracks. Ignored by the general public, this album is one of the greatest alternative statements released in the nineties. This album defines the need for the parental advisory label. \\"My Feet Itch\\" Where can you find an album with lyrics like that.
0743298039|2.0|Two stars because this is good idea for a book but a bad job of realizing its potential. I actually considered one star but it wasn't horrible so much as lazy.  This book was chosen by my reading group. I read every bit of it and remain unconvinced by the reviews. In the first chapter, I was intrigued by the statement, \\"Children mythologize their own births.\\" I thought, OK - that could lead somewhere interesting. Ultimately, I was disappointed.    Here's what bothered me most:    1. Books, libraries, bookstores, and writers figure in the story in the most superficial way!     2. The device of not fixing the story in time was merely annoying since it did not add to the story in any way. So many details were just silly or wrong or nonsensical. Or all three!     3.  Margaret seems like a fairly dimwitted biographer/researcher if she does not know common genealogic nomenclature and needs to hire a private detective to locate birth and death records. (Isn't that what researchers do?)     4. The governess is modern enough to challenge cultural norms AND is scientifically inclined AND business-like enough to be un-intimidated by a dilapidated, filthy and apparently evil house associated with decades of village gossip BUT she is so superstitious she is unnerved by \\"seeing\\" something seemingly unexplainable? Really?     5. There were shaggy dogs embedded in this story that did everything but sit up and howl. The bizarre exposition with which the storylines are tidied up at the end was a pretty lazy device.     6. The wealthiest, most published author in the English language scratched out her books left handed to save her damaged right hand - there were no typewriters? stenographers? tape recorders? computers?      7. Vera Winter's true identity was a secret and yet, though she is the most famous author in the world and has been for decades, her very distinctive physical appearance was never noticed by people from her past?     8. And there's the whole Jane Eyre thing: Who stops reading a book because something sad happens to the main character? I know, I know - it's supposed to reflect events in the lives of the characters in this book. And foreshadow events in the story within the story. Ho-hum.     The only way to manipulate readers into accepting some of the above mentioned anachronisms is to avoid dates. I am willing to suspend my disbelief in service to a good gothic yarn but this was not it. A much better - and much more satisfying - treatment of similar elements is AS Byatt's Angels & Insects. (Another review mentioned Flowers in the Attic by VC Andrews, although that was a little too Jerry Springer for my tastes and read like a romance novel.)
0743496736|5.0|Wow, this is a hard one to get off one's mind.  Having gone through something so unbelievingly similar, it makes me think perhaps Ms. Picoult endured what she wrote about.  The feelings were real, the pain, the sorrow, the guilt, the what if's...all so true.  I was spell bound through the entire book.  Rarely does an author do this for me.  Please read this, do not go untouched by it.  Allow it to remind us about what really matters in case we have some how forgotten.

0525948023|1.0|While there are elements of truth in what Eckhart Tolle is saying, his emphasis on himself as an awakened or enlightened being is very suspect to me.  Also, his implication that we should (and can) all just wake up by listening to his brilliant words seems to me to be a superficial fix to a subtle and thorny problem.  Anyone can be mindful for an instant, staying mindful, though, can be the work of a lifetime.  As several reviews have noted, his writings are largely warmed-over Buddhism.    For those of you looking to wake up, I'd recommend reading Mindfulness in Plain English; it's getting at the same issue using a much more structured, time-tested approach, and best of all, it's free to download on the Web --just google it.

014017821X|4.0|Years ago, I stumbled onto one of the short stories in this book in another anthology, and loved it. It was called the Erl-King, but I couldn't remember the author, and was never able to find it again. I ordered The Bloody Chamber for the retelling of the Bluebeard story, and was thrilled to find that the Erl-King was one of the other stories.     All the stories in this book are wonderful. They are all dark and bloody as any good fairy tale is, and beautifully written. I pined over the Erl-king for years, so it was a joy to reread it, and to find the other tales inside just as good.

1594481717|1.0|I bought this book recently but after a few pages it just became too simplistic in its content and I began to wonder whether it was even worth the effort to write such a book unless of course you can make some money from sticking a few ideas down on paper.  It appears that hardly any serious reserach and investigation had been done to support the thesis.  Waste of money as it could be sped read in the bookshop in about 5 minutes and you would learn just as much as you would from buying the book.
0061245097|4.0|Frost's Night Huntress books are fun reads that don't take themselves too seriously. Think Buffy the Vampire Slayer in paperback form. Entertaining, vampire-slaying good time, and a little drama without a bunch of angst.     I was suprised to read that the sequel to \\"Halfway to the Grave\\" started off four years after the last ended. By now Cat has a well established team of vampire hunters, but still can't help but miss Bones. It's a good thing, then, that he is thrown back into her life.     I enjoyed this sequel more than the first. I was disappointed with Cat and Bones's seperation at the end of the last book so was happy to see that he is back and takes a leading spot in this story. I would like to see the other characters a bit more fleshed out and am interested in where the author takes the series.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I bought this book because my son is autistic.  In this work of fiction, the author did a wonderful job of combining plot with insight into how someone with autism copes with a complicated, noisy world that is almost impossible to understand.  The plot is fast-paced, and the looks inside the mind of Christopher, the main character, are priceless.
1878424319|1.0|The book is disappointing on many levels. If your life is so shallow that you need to hear some of the common sense and simple views in this book, you are already in trouble. You could learn more from Buddha and Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />And what is this garbage about Toltec wisdom? The Toltecs were an extremely aggressive and expansionistic society in MesoAmerican history. Although they left a number of monuments and numerous glyphs at cities like Chitzen Itza (which is as Mayan as Toltec), they were hardly peace-loving group from whom I would draw deep wisdom for everyday life.<br /><br />May I suggest probing through Zen Buddhism for more enlightenment or the Gospel accounts associated with Jesus of Nazareth. I have found far more richness and depth.<br /><br />If you are bent on being \\"free\\" in your \\"spirit\\" and making your own morality and rules then maybe you should read Nietzsche for that line of absurdity. At least, he has more intellectual prowess to offer. Again, this is a book does not offer any new, deep, spiritual wisdom. Indeed, it's just a simple read on four dynamics that you might agree with in a world without restraint. Sorry, this does not measure up to anything astounding.

B000ZN802W|5.0|I could probably sympathize with Chris McCandless more than many others I've seen in film, especially nowadays. People have called his journey a declaration of stupidity and irrationality. I don't find it to be either stupid or irrational. Society has truly become a terrible thing, and Chris realized that before anyone else he knew.<br />What this film truly was was a journey for Chris to find people he could relate to, people who understood him and people he could understand himself, because he could not get that at home. I think he was trying to find a world he could understand, and a world he could live in better than the one he was.<br /><br />I'm not finalizing this, because there are still some films I want to see, but this is probably my favorite film of 2007.
B00000JQFM|5.0|Don't read this review, buy the darn album! This is instrumental rock that's accessible without being watered down. After a few moments of muffled studio chatter, the album literally starts off like a jet engine and doesn't stop rocking until \\"Always With Me, Always With You.\\" A tasteful ballad that doesn't descend into cliched sap. Things kick up again with \\"Satch Boogie\\" and take a turn for the strange at \\"Hill of the Skull.\\" Even though that is kind of a one-off, it's amusing.    \\"Circles\\" and \\"Lords of Karma\\" are complex songs, not as frenetic as the first three, but with excellent melodies. \\"Midnight\\" is pure beauty that segues into \\"Echoes,\\" which is a bit like \\"Circles\\" but with more restraint. It ends the album not with a bang, but with a whimper for more. Every rock fan needs this record.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|this is simply the best movie of all time.  I had to order another copy since I had worn out my original from watching it to often.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Ok, so this is NOT Confessions part 2 and yes, I was one of the million people expecting this record to be it. This record was hard to digest for me at the first listenings maybe because COADF is my favorite Madonna album, but the woman truly knows what she's doing, which cleverly is in not repeating herself. I was relieved when I heard that it wasn't all hip hop and R&B, but she successfully makes them her own and even more when she fuse the rythms into a more mainstream, dance sound.  When did I started enjoying it? When I turn my speakers real loud for \\"Candy Shop\\" the beats and the lyrical innuendo is just plain fun. \\"4 Minutes\\"...well the horns and the heavy bass line is catchy and you won't even know when the song is in your head for days and days.  Clearly the Pharell tracks are most outstanding than the Timbaland ones, \\"Give It 2 Me\\" and \\"Beat Goes On\\" are pure club anthems specially the first one, I can't recall hearing a self empowerment anthem of Madge this good since \\"Express Yourself\\". \\"Miles Away\\" and \\"Voices\\" are introspective not in a kabballah way; great ballads.   So this is Madonna pimped out, the bling is clearly showed on the artwork and it works perfectly; it's danceable, enjoyable and filled with guilty pleasure tracks. Overall, another bull's eye from Her Majesty.
B000002UTI|2.0|I do not really like John Lennon singing. I only bought the CD for the only song I like, which is Imagine.
B00000DOZ6|5.0|Okay, so I've got every Led Zeppelin album, I've listened to 'em quite a few times, and I just don't hear the magic. Essentially, most of the group's work, including the widely acclaimed untitled one, leaves me cold. I can certainly respect the group's instrumental prowess, and at least Plant was an original, but... sorry. They're just missing something very important. Consistent songwriting. I count three consistently well-written records out of Zep's original nine (counting Coda): III, this one, and In Through the Out Door. Not surprisingly, they're the three best records the band ever made.<br />But I must admit this is a fantastic album. In fact, I'll go as far as saying that it's almost the entire reason for Led Zeppelin's existence. See, the best songs on each of their albums, and that includes the god-awful Presence, are all very good, even though only one (not surprisingly found on this album) would make it on my 100 personal favorites list. But here, other than on a couple songs like the funk parody \\"The Crunge\\" and the good but ham-fisted reggae experiment \\"D'yer Ma'ker\\", they sustain that spark which is found in their best songs: \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", \\"Ramble On\\" and so forth. The best song here, and really the best song Led Zeppelin did, sustains that and then some. \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" absolutely rules, man. Maybe not as much as, say, any given Hendrix tune, but it's fantastic. A hard rocker with a subtle acoustic introduction that's close to gorgeous. And the hard rock part has an inspired guitar solo, with an equally inspired bass line. The quiet harpsichord near the end rules, too. So it's because of all this I can ignore Plant's screeching \\"Many times I've loved...\\" (suffice it to say I'm no fan of his) and take the song for what it's worth.<br />But there's more. \\"The Rain Song\\" may not seem like much at first, and it took me forever to truly digest it, but now it's my second-favorite Led Zeppelin song. It's not really catchy or anything, and the swooping Mellotron does kind of date it to the early '70s, although it still sounds pretty good in context, but it's so well-arranged that it's hard for me to resist. The piano fills John Paul Jones (who always was my favorite member of the group) are majestic. When Bonham finally enters, he adds a steady, almost intoxicating rhythm. Plus Page decides not to ruin it by playing a technically stunning but unemotional and overly flashy guitar solo, instead sticking to a subtle rhythm guitar with elements of country, folk, and jazz. Good for him. As another aside, I've always thought that Page was more interesting as a rhythm guitarist and riff-player than a lead guitarist. Maybe if they had two guitar players...<br />\\"The Song Remains the Same\\", the record's well-known opener, is another example of what I'm talking about with \\"The Rain Song\\". At first it seems  like the group's just trying to blind you with their speed, a trap they fell into on \\"Communications Breakdown\\". But a second listen reveals just how much is going on here. Listen to how many different parts Page is playing. More than I could come up with, that's for sure - I never was much of a guitarist, probably because I already play bass, sax, piano and drums and let's face it, four is enough. And for all I said about his lead guitar playing, the solo's pretty damn good. Plant overdoes the high-pitched shrieking, though, sounding uncomfortably close to Geddy Lee.<br />And that's just the first three songs. Really, it's an all-around excellent record, even though nothing else, bar the three-part \\"Ocean\\" (which morphs from searing metal to doo-wop) can come close to the dynamic duo of \\"The Rain Song\\" and \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\". But I like the remaining songs plenty! \\"No Quarter\\" is spooky, and again demonstrates what a talented keyboard player John Paul Jones was. I don't even mind the lyrics - I'm a myth geek, see, and I can definitely indulge Plant when he goes on about Vikings (At least I think it's a song about vikings) and dogs of doom and whatnot. It's a lot more interesting than him singing about sex, because let's face it, everyone sings about sex. I'm not opposed to it on moral grounds by any means (do I LOOK like Sean Hannity to you?), but... come on, there are like five billion other things to sing about. Okay, right, looooong tangent. Moving right along. I'm writing a record review, am I not? \\"Dancing Days\\" is good. Very interesting riff. However, there's another, slower version I personally prefer, because it really brings that interesting riff out.<br />J'aime bien!

B000002KMY|5.0|I might get some funny looks but I may actually like Mob Rules better than Paranoid or Master of Reality. It's hard, fast, slow, and epic all at once. Sabbath gets a leaner, though still heavy, sound here. Dio is an aquired taste for some but he puts in a great performance here. Some people may not like the more 80's influenced metal sound but for those who do, this is a real treasure.    Turn Up the Night: Starts off with four quick beats of the hi-hat and then all hell breaks loose. Straight ahead metal. Iommi and Geezer's riffing is hard and heavy, Vinny's drumming is a welcome change of pace and Dio is strong as ever. A personal favorite.    Voodoo: A return to the slower, pounding songs of the early days, with maybe a touch more speed. The riff is pure evil and Dio's lyrics work well here. Iommi rips it on the solo.    The Sign of the Southern Cross: Starts off quietly, with Dio softly crooning. The metaphors and phrases in the opening lyrics seem a little silly to me, a complaint I have with some of Dio's work. Then Vinny attacks, followed closely by Iommi and Geezer, and all is forgotten. This riff is bone crunching and used sparingly, leaving Dio set mostly to Vinny's drumming. Both prove up to the challenge.    E5150: If you work the title out in Roman numerals, this song spells EVIL. Spooky keyboard and synth throughout, with Iommi contributing some weird guitar effects. As a stand-alone, this isn't much of a song. In fact, I would call it boring. However, taken as an extended intro to the following one, it's quite effective. Builds up a creepy, dark atmosphere which...    Mob Rules: Explodes into one of Iommi's best riffs. Pounds and pounds and pounds to Dio waling about the mob and something evil in the night. Dio shines here, snarling line after line as Appice lays a powerful beat, with Geezer galloping along. Lean, fast, evil. One of Sabbath's best.    Country Girl: The title sounds like it couldn't possibly involve evil or demons, right? WRONG. A Country Girl who steals souls. Perhaps they should have taken a break but when you've got a good thing going, why stop? Good riff, kind of a change of pace from most of Iommi's, and Dio's pretty good on this one.    Slipping Away: The riff here isn't as strong but the dueling solo between Geezer and Tony more than makes up for it.    Falling Off the Edge of the World: Another track highlight for me. Starts off with some slow, emotional guitar work and vocals. Then it melts away with a dark, brooding voice intoning \\"aaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh.\\" The song picks up pace. Dio sings like a man who's \\"seen the faces of doom\\" pretty convincingly. A little more depressing than the other tracks, I quite like it.    Over and Over: A good closer. Not a great one, unfortunately. Dio gets very emotional but the track is a little lackluster compared to the rest of the album. It's good, just not as good.    With the exception of the last track, all these are far above average or just plain exceptional Sabbath tracks. For me, this is the best Dio era album and in the top 5 Black Sabbath albums.
B0015HQ326|5.0|This movie offers you a lot more than your ordinary love story. It gives you an insight into what makes us essentially human. The actors and actresses did a good job portraying their flawed and fragile characters, making you laugh,cry and smile with them. Norah Jones is great as an actress - her character is the most complex of all, yet the most human.You could feel what her character goes through, what she's thinking and feeling. Not bad at all for a first timer. Definitely a movie that I'd watch again and again.    Hope this helps.

B000QXDED6|1.0|Motion pictures seldom present history with significant accuracy, so it would be unfair to condemn this one because it follows suit.  What makes 300 so dire isn't that it is wildly, wildly inaccurate; it is the downright silliness of the whole presentation.  I found it impossible to believe that a bunch of Chippendale strippers with red capes, black bikini underwear, and a total lack of acting expertise would be a barrier to Paris Hilton, much less the hordes of the Persian empire.<br /><br />The film goes so far astray from the facts of the celebrated Battle of Thermopylae that we need hardly mention that event at all; suffice to say that the movie arises from the \\"graphic novel\\" (i.e. a comic book for the over-21 set) by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley, who did a fanciful riff on the idea of three hundred soliders fighting to their deaths.  By the time it reached the screen, that riff had been mythologized, computerized, colorized, and glamorized to a point at which it feels very much like a low-quality 1960s Japanese cartoon on a hung-over Saturday morning.<br /><br />The story, such as it is, concerns King Leonidas of Sparta (played by the significantly untalented Gerard Butler), who gets ticked off at a Persian messenger, kills him, and thereby more or less precipitates the Greco-Persian War.  After receiving a little T&A from The Oracle (Kelly Craig) and playing slap-and-tickle with wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey), he leads 299 of his best off to the glory of still more CGI and certain death.  Along the way there is a little racism, a little homophobia, and enough of an S&M-ish edge to make you wonder if Freud might have been onto to something after all.<br /><br />It is all nonsense and ultimately less plausible than CLASH OF THE TITANS, but the real killer is the fact that the whole thing is as slow as molasses in winter.  The pace is deadly dull, and for all the CGI skill on display 300 isn't even clever in terms of cinematography or art design.  There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the least surprising, pulse-pounding, or emotionally or intellectually engaging, or even technically innovative about any of it.<br /><br />This is the sort of film that appeals almost exclusively to the \\"Man, that is WAY cool!\\" crowd, who will no doubt yak endlessly about pixels while scratching their pimpled cheeks and generally waiting for Quentin Tarantino to make another movie as good as GRINDHOUSE.  But unless you happen to fall into that category, take my advice and don't be suckered.

0446402389|5.0|Tom Rob Smith's \\"Child 44\\" plunges the reader into the unspeakable horrors of life in the Soviet Union--a repressive dictatorship that spewed out propaganda built on lies and delusions, and rewarded both conformity and the betrayal of one's friends and family.  The harrowing opening chapter takes place in 1933.  Ukrainian villagers are facing famine as a result of Stalin's failed agricultural policies.  The sick and starving inhabitants are reduced to eating insects in order to survive for one more day.  A dying woman releases her beloved cat, praying that it escapes before it is hunted down for food.  A ten-year-old boy named Pavel is elated when he spots the animal.  He decides to capture it and bring it home to his mother, Oksana, but his plans go terribly awry.<br /><br />Twenty years pass and the country is firmly in the grip of Stalinism.  The protagonist, thirty-year-old Leo Stepanovich Demidov, is a member of the MGB, the State Security Force.  He is a good-looking former military hero whose photograph was prominently featured on the front page of Pravda as a symbol of Russia's victory over the Germans.  He is convinced that his job, which includes apprehending individuals suspected of espionage, springs from \\"the necessity of guarding their revolution from enemies both foreign and domestic....\\"  The Soviet Union has become a place where any remark critical of government policy is punishable by arrest or even execution.  Friends and neighbors routinely turn against one another; loyalty has become a rare commodity.<br /><br />Leo's latest task is to look into the death of a four-year-old boy named Arkady, whose naked corpse was found on a railway line, his mouth stuffed with what appears to be dirt.  The government has decided that this \\"was a tragic accident with no question of blame.\\"  Leo has been assigned this case because the boy's grieving father, Fyodor Andreev, one of Leo's subordinates, insists that his son was murdered. Leo tries to convince Fyodor to stop spreading wild rumors about child killers.  Such unfounded speculation could undermine faith in Stalin's \\"perfect\\" society where crime no longer officially exists.  Next, Leo, who is hopped up on amphetamines (prescribed by MGB doctors to keep him focused), pursues Anatoly Brodsky, a veterinarian suspected of being a traitor.  Even though there is little hard evidence against Brodsky, Leo ruthless hunts him down, believing that it is \\"better to let ten innocent men suffer than one spy escape.\\"<br /><br />\\"Child 44\\" is a riveting portrayal of a ruthless and repressive regime--Orwell's \\"1984\\" brought to life.  Leo has sold his soul to the devil, and his wife, Raisa, a refugee with a tragic past, despises him for it.  Leo's archenemy is his second in command, the selfish and vicious Vasili Ilyich Nikitin, who would like nothing better than to catch him in a fatal error and take his place in the MGB hierarchy.  Leo, who has been brainwashed to believe that \\"the survival of their political system justified anything,\\" undergoes a gradual transformation. As a result of the horrors he has witnessed, his own immoral actions, and his wife's contempt for him, Leo begins to feel remorse for being \\"a player in a grotesque farce\\" and for blindly adhering to the commands of an insane political system.  When Raisa is suspected of being a spy, Leo must make a choice.  Should he denounce her and thereby save himself and his parents, or behave honorably in an attempt to regain his self-respect?<br /><br />Smith's prose is masterful.  His descriptive writing perfectly captures the dismal conditions that Stalin's catastrophic economic and social programs produced.  He depicts Lubyanka, the MGB headquarters where those suspected of espionage and counterrevolutionary activity are confined, as a chilling edifice of hopelessness.  The author states that \\"there was something about the building itself which made people uneasy, as though fear had been factored into the design....It wasan assembly line of guilt.\\"  Most of the men and women who enter Lubyanka are tortured and made to sign false \\"confessions.\\"  Subsequently, they are shipped off to the Gulag or executed.  Even children are not immune from punishment.  Raisa's secondary school students are so afraid of authority that \\"discipline was never a problem.... Youth provided no protection.  The age at which a child could be shot for their crimes, or their father's crimes, was twelve.\\"  Smith manages to infuse even such an innocuous activity as slumber with a feeling of terror.  \\"It was four in the morning, arresting hour--the best time to seize a person, to grab them from their sleep.  They were vulnerable, disoriented.\\"  What kind of human being takes such sadistic pleasure in exploiting the helplessness of ordinary citizens?<br /><br />This is a wrenching and multifaceted work of historical fiction.  It is also a powerful character study; an indictment of a paranoid dictator who destroyed millions while promising to create an ideal social order; a gripping tale of suspense in which Leo tracks a serial killer who has slain and mutilated dozens of children; and a touching story of a broken man's attempt to rediscover his conscience and redeem himself.  In spite of an overly complicated plot and a conclusion that may be a bit too pat considering what has gone before, \\"Child 44\\" succeeds as a searing account of one of the most appalling eras in the annals of totalitarianism.  It is also a tale of courage and self-sacrifice, of the willingness of a few to defy the odds and seek justice for those without a voice.<br /><br />Warning for the faint of heart:  \\"Child 44\\" is not for the squeamish, as it contains many disturbing scenes of graphic violence.\\"  Most of the men and women who enter Lubyanka are tortured and made to sign false \\"confessions.\\"  Subsequently, they are shipped off to the Gulag or executed.    Even children are not immune from punishment.  Raisa's secondary school students are so afraid of authority that \\"discipline was never a problem.... Youth provided no protection.

It is also a powerful character study; an indictment of a paranoid dictator who destroyed millions while promising to create an ideal social order; a gripping tale of suspense in which Leo tracks a serial killer who has slain and mutilated dozens of children; and a touching story of a broken man's attempt to rediscover his conscience and redeem himself.    In spite of an overly complicated plot and a conclusion that may be a bit too pat considering what has gone before, \\"Child 44\\" succeeds as a searing account of one of the most appalling eras in the annals of totalitarianism.  It is also a tale of courage and self-sacrifice, of the willingness of a few to defy the odds and seek justice for those without a voice.    Warning for the faint of heart:  \\"Child 44\\" is not for the squeamish, as it contains many disturbing scenes of graphic violence.
B000VR824S|5.0|Great, I bought twenty copies and gave nineteen to my closest friends. As the Tee-shirt states, Eric Clapton IS GOD! And this DVD, with Eric and Friends, re-enforces that statement. Also the proceeds go to a great cause.
0525950079|3.0|I throughly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth.  However, while reading World Without End I kept noticing how the characters and plot were similar to what I'd read in Pillers of the Earth. It seemed a rehash with a few things added such as the plague and lesbianism.  The author repeated information already known from reading about it a hundred pages back or so. Personally, I found this to be terribly annoying and insulting. Ken Follett is a talented writer, but this book is not one of his best.
0596101996|5.0|When I first started programming javascript that lasted only a week or so (this was around 2000), the trouble I had with it was with the loose typing and the generality of the language.  After reading the core portion of this book, I got to see the advantages and power of what I had problems with.  It only took me 12 hours to go from literally clueless to semi-proficient.  It also helped that I went through a whole semester of software design in C++.  Another subtle part of the book that you do not need to have a semester of software design to learn the language, the author does well to explain the material well.  If you are new to javascript, I'd probably get another book to go along with this.

B000EGDAI4|5.0|No CD comes with a 100% satisfaction guarantee, but the first minute or so of \\"St. Thomas\\" -- with Max Roach setting up the calypso beat on his toms and then Sonny coming in on sax -- is about as close as it gets. What a perfect introduction to Sonny Rollins, and maybe jazz in general. \\"St. Thomas\\" is the most memorable performance here, due to the insanely catchy melody, but the other tracks are equally rewarding. \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" is a superb reading of the ballad. \\"Moritat\\" (better known as \\"Mac the Knife\\") swings along leisurely while \\"Strode Rode\\" chugs along at a more hectic pace. And \\"Blue 7\\" is a blues (obviously) that allows all four musicians to stretch out, with a particularly inspired solo by Rollins. The two guys that really shine here are Sonny and Max Roach, but you can't forget Tommy Flanagan's always-tasteful piano and Doug Watkin's tight bass playing. Saxophone Colossus is one of the first jazz CDs a jazz newbie should hear, and if you like it pick up Sonny's Way Out West and A Night at the Village Vanguard as well.    [This review is based on the K2 20-bit reissue, which has great sound.  The tracklist is identical to the RVG.]
B000V8I2QU|4.0|Well, saying this is the Boss' best work is quite superlative.  Saying \\"Magic,\\" is a quality album that sounds fresh for any artist regardless of age (but Bruce is turning 60) is more accurate.  Here's where I'm coming from.  I caught Bruce and the E Streeters twice mind you on the Born In the USA tour and listened to his three or four CD live album countless times.  My whole family to include my 60's (age not era mind you) parents, brother, and my two kids are big Boss fans, but I'll not blindly rush to heap praise on \\"Magic,\\" just because the Boss did it.  There are moments here that equal some of his better work but as a whole I'd have to say it falls in the middle of the pack...ahead of Lucky Town and that other forgettable album that came out at the same time, but definitely behind the Boss's best, \\"The Rising,\\" and \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\"<br /><br />\\"Magic\\" starts off with a kick in \\"Radio Nowhere,\\" the fairly ubiquitous pop rocking rave-up.  There are pleasant moments throughout but the album's highlights (besides Radio Nowhere) are the absolute driving and mad \\"The Last To Die.\\"  It goes, \\"blood will spill and hearts will break, who'll be the last to die for a mistake,\\" and by listening to the chorus it sounds like Bruce may be making some social commentary about the Iraq war but when you listen to the bridges, it might be about something else.  Bruce spares no punches in concert about the subject of \\"Magic,\\" another of the album's highlights.  \\"I got shackles on my wrist / Soon I'll slip 'em and be gone / Chain me in a box in the river / And I'll rise singin' this song / On the road the sun is sinkin' low / There's bodies hangin' in the trees / This is what will be, This is what will be\\"  Dark, Bruce, dark.<br /><br />Just when you go and think Bruce has lost all faith he produces another of the album's highlights in \\"Long Walk Home.\\"  Something about these lyrics leaps right out at me and grabs me by the heart, \\"Here everybody has a neighbor / Everybody has a friend / Everybody has a reason to begin again / My father said \\"Son, we're lucky in this town / It's a beautiful place to be born / Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone...means certain things are set in stone / Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't\\"  There goes Bruce believing in our hometown again, believing in beginning again, even though it seems he's temporarily lost faith in some of our nation's policies.<br /><br />This is very good Bruce which on any day is better than 90% of the stuff out there.  After all these years, the man and his group of merry-makers from the Jersey shore are still relevant, are still fresh.  But don't go into this thinking this is the best Bruce.  That's a hard row to hoe my friend.  Get it now...you must have a little magic in your life.  --MMWnd / Everybody has a reason to begin again / My father said \\"Son, we're lucky in this town / It's a beautiful place to be born / Nobody crowds you, nobody goes it alone...means certain things are set in stone / Who we are, what we'll do and what we won't\\"  There goes Bruce believing in our hometown again, believing in beginning again, even though it seems he's temporarily lost faith in some of our nation's policies.

B00005JPUN|2.0|I often find it perplexing why some actors and actresses sign on for some of the movies that they do, especially when it should be obvious from the get-go that the movie will not be all that great or even do remotely well at the box office. Case in point would be the most recent adaptation of Jack Finney's classic novel The Body Snatchers called \\"The Invasion\\" starring Nicole Kidman (\\"The Others\\") and Daniel Craig (\\"007: Casino Royale\\").    \\"The Invasion\\" follows the life of Carol Bennell (Nicole Kidman), a Washington D.C. psychiatrist, who begins to suspect that many of the people around her, and throughout the rest of the city are acting suspiciously out of character. As the oddities begin to mount, and the rest of the world follows suit, Carol along with her close friend Ben Driscoll (Daniel Craig) believe that maybe we have been invaded by an outside force. It appears that the change in people's personalities and behavior only occur after they have entered a deep sleep for the night, now Carol and Ben must fight to stay awake and stay alive before they succumb to the change that is quickly overtaking everyone in the entire world.    I really wanted to see this movie when I first heard about it, but I found it odd that I hadn't seen all that many previews for it prior to its release. Truthfully, I don't believe I saw a single preview advertising this film's release until a week or two before its debut in theaters across the country. Generally when hardly any previews are shown prior to a film's release, it is a fairly good indication that the movie will not be all that great, and it will nine times out of ten be followed up by rather lousy reviews from the critics. Well, go figure the movie was released and what do you know, the critics seemed to absolutely hate it. With that knowledge I figured I wouldn't see \\"The Invasion\\" unless it was a cheap rental or free on TV at some point. However, I recently heard that the movie turned out to be better than expected andthat some of the critics may have been overly harsh in their initial criticism of the movie. So, I decided to give the movie a try, but after viewing it, I should have trusted the critics and my own instincts about the movie, and avoided it completely.    \\"The Invasion\\" is one of those kinds of movies that tries really hard to scare the audience with genuine thrills, relying less on shock value; except it never actually succeeds in accomplishing its goal. The film's pace is way too slow, which works for some movies, but in this one it causes boredom to set in and a general lack of interest in the movie's overall outcome. The story for the film was somewhat strange to me, now I must admit that I have never read the novel on which this film is based, but I have to believe that for the novel to be as successful as it was it must have been more entertaining than this adaptation. Aside from the pacing being too slow, the motives for the invading force (presumably aliens of some kind, though we never see them or a ship) are somewhat confusing. It appears that their ultimate goal is for us to live in a world of peace and harmony, and they believe that the only way we can achieve this end result is for them to take us over. Well, that's all fine and dandy, except why go through all the trouble just to promote peace in our world. If they felt that we were too destructive of a race to ever truly achieve peace in our world, why not just kill us all, allowing them to set up shop on our world and then they could live in peace in our stead. At least that plot makes a bit more sense to me, plus it never was explained why they singled us out to begin with. I mean choosing us because of our destructive nature was their primary motive, but the fact that the invaders seemed to be willing to live out their days in our bodies indicated that they were content with living on our world. So, was there something wrong with their world, or was it destroyed or rendered uninhabitable? These questions began to become more pressing to me as the movie unfolded and the motive for the invaders began to seem more and more ridiculous and just too simple to believe. If the movie had addressed some of the questions I had raised, perhaps the movie would have been better, but the pacing still would have been an issue, though at least the actual story would have made a bit more sense to me in the process.    The acting was decent, but I expected more from at least the two leads in the picture, Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig. Nicole did a fairly solid job as a single mother who is just desperate to save her son from sharing the fate of most of mankind, although in a few scenes I thought she went a little overboard with the hysteria as she struggled to find her son and then keep him safe. Daniel Craig was a little more on the other end of the acting spectrum; instead of going overboard in his performance, I found him to be a little too subdued and almost bored with his character, which led me to not care about his character's fate nearly as much as I should have. The supporting cast was alright, most of their performances were wooden, but I forgive that because I believe that was the way the director wanted them to act so the audience could differentiate between those who were normal humans and those who had been taken over.    In the end, \\"The Invasion\\" really fails to gain any real momentum within the story. The acting was decent, but a bit too uneven amongst the various performances that the unevenness begins to distract from the already dull story. Perhaps with better pacing, more consistent performances, and a much stronger motive for the invading forces, \\"The Invasion\\" may have proven to have been a better movie. Instead, \\"The Invasion\\" wound up being just another below average science-fiction movie that tried to take itself too seriously and found itself generally disliked by the critics and moviegoers everywhere.    \\"The Invasion\\" is rated PG-13 for language and violence.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is different.  It's interesting how some people feel she's \\"sold out\\" or is not being original because she's trying to captialize off of the Hip Hop market, which is predominant in the USA. I say, she is smart, if anything.    She's been doing this for 25 years now, so I'm sure she's got it down.  Also, this is not her first time dipping into the Hip Hop/R&B World.  She did similar things over 14 years ago people.  DO YOUR RESEARCH.    This is why this album is 5 stars and worth every penny.    Madonna is the \\"mother of reinvention\\".  She has consitently made herself and her music relevant in our society.  This album is a reflection of that.    Granted, this album is not \\"Ray of Light\\" or the equally amazing \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\".  However, this is yet another side of what she can do.    Though this album is full of Hip Hop sounds and influences, it's Madonna that makes this a celebration of Pop Music.  Just listen to her vocals on \\"Incredible.\\" She is giving us 80's Madge, a time in which she was building the dynasty we see today. This album furthermore solidifies her title as the Queen of Pop.  It's truly a great final work before her departure to Live Nation and the future, which I'm sure will be exciting.    Wow, to think Madonna will be like that of Tina, Cher, and some few.  The keyword is \\"few\\".  Not many can do what these women can do. And no, Mariah is not part of this group (see my review of E=MC2 for a laugh).    On to the album...    I've always felt that if an album has at least 4 tracks that are good, the album overall isn't a failure. Out of 12 tracks released domestically, this album has 10/12 standout tracks.  I do love the other two as well, but 10 really caught my ear, ear candy;)    Songs that could easily be singles:    01. Candy Shop  02. 4 Minutes (already a huge hit obviously)  03. Give it 2 Me (her next single, which is my overall favorite Dance track)  04. Heartbeat  05. Miles Away  08. Beat Goes On  11. Devil Wouldn't Recognize You  12. Voices (My favorite track overall, regardless of music style)    My guilty pleasure:  10. Spanish Lesson (I dunno about most of you, but I LOVE this song! LOL it's a very silly/stupid song, but it works.  And people, we KNOW the translations are not the literal translations. It's not meant to be literal! This is done in English and Spanish (I speak both) all the time! DUH!    I am sure this album will debut at #1 both here and abroad.  From what I can see, the early figures are showing her to be #1 in about 12 countries. Can she get up to 29 like her predecessor \\"Confessions\\"?  I hope so.    Madge has done it yet again people.  IGNORE HATERS! BUY THE ALBUM.    ~sP
B0012GMV58|4.0|This is the 5th album by the \\"Santana band\\", but by this point the only guys remaining from the Woodstock lineup were Carlos, drummer Mike Shrieve, and percussionist Chepito Areas. They were joined by two (!) keyboardists (Richard Kermode and Tom Coster), percussionist Armando Peraza, bassist Doug Rauch and vocalist Leon Thomas. Carlos's chief collaborators in the band were Coster and Shrieve, who pulled the band in a decidedly jazzy direction. The overall sound is even mellower than Caravanserai and pretty far removed from the classic Santana sound.    Santana was never a great songwriting group, and so the meat of the album lies in the instrumental pieces. There's a beautiful arrangement by Alice Coltrane (\\"Going Home\\"), a serene interpretation of John Coltrane's \\"Welcome\\" (listen to Trane's original on Kulu Se Mama, it is heartbreakingly beautiful!), Chepito's very cool \\"Samba de Sausalito\\", and an intriguing cover of Herbie Mann's \\"Mother Africa\\" with the angular soprano sax playing of Jules Broussard. In addition, \\"Flame Sky\\" reunites Carlos and John McLaughlin in a fiery duel that easily exceeds anything they did on their collaboration Love Devotion and Surrender. The vocal tunes are mostly R&B-ish with the smooth vocals of Leon Thomas (I wonder why he didn't contribute any of his trademark yodelling), plus Flora Purim's classic voice on \\"Yours Is the Light\\".    This isn't an unqualified triumph, but people who like jazz-rock or this phase of Santana's career need to pick it up. Caravanserai is a stronger album, though, so check out that one first.    [This review is based on an older version of the album which did not include the bonus track \\"Mantra\\".]
B00005JPS8|4.0|After being captured in Afghanistan and forced, against his will, to build a particularly nasty type of missile for the enemy, billionaire inventor and weapons manufacturer, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) instead builds himself a super-suit and escapes. Upon returning to the United States, Stark improves on his super-suit and then sets about trying to correct all of the damage he has done through the sales of weapons.    I did not expect to like \\"Iron Man\\". I have seen a lot of superhero films in my life and I usually find that the acting is second-rate and the endings are irritatingly open-ended. The only reason why I went to see \\"Iron Man\\" at all was because my father wanted to see it and I just went along to keep him company. I'm now glad that I did, because it is a surprisingly good film.     I have always considered Robert Downey Jr. to be an excellent actor (I still think he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for \\"Chaplin\\") and his performance in \\"Iron Man\\" is no exception. Downey turns in one of his best performances in years and is ably supported by Jeff Bridges as the film's villain. Furthermore, the film's ending provides enough closure so that this film can stand by itself without sequels (although, I am certain that the film's makers would be more than happy to continue the franchise).     The film's script is filled with the sort of light-hearted bantering that is typical of a Robert Downey Jr. film but also has a point to make about the culpability of weapons manufacturers. I particularly liked the fact that this film was set in the real world, rather than in a universe that exists almost parallel to our reality, like \\"Batman\\" or \\"Superman\\". My main criticism of this film is that it is just so predictable. Some of the plot twists I could see coming for almost an hour before they eventuated.    Overall, this film is definitely worth your time and money. \\"Iron Man\\" is targeted at a more mature audience than films such as \\"Spiderman\\" or \\"X-Men\\", but itstill should appeal to viewers of all ages. And if you do go and see it, make sure you stay until the end of the credits. Although the credits are very long, as has been pointed out by other reviewers, those who do sit through them are rewarded by an extra scene at the end of them, which is definitely worth the wait.
B0013J30XG|1.0|I hate to confirm the first reviewer suspicion, but his RIGHT!  I have seen alot of speed racer trailers and I will have to say this movie is in big trouble.
B000FZETKC|5.0|This is one of thr best teen movies to come out in the 1980's. The characters were well developed and had more than one dimesion. There was good and bad in ALL of the charcters, just like there is in real people. I love how confident Eric is, getting along with Amanda, his best friends, and the toughs he meets. My fave scene in this movie has to be when the tough guys show up to help and the party, and how some of the rich girls liked them. It ended the way I wish it would, although I wonder if the money on those diamonds could have been put to better use, his girl would have loved him anyways. If you haven't seen it, check it out cause it's not a cheesy bubble gum movie. I still love it as an adult.
0525950079|5.0|Loved it. A real page-turner. I wasn't sure I'd like the title, but once into the book I didn't care what it was called! Follett's books are also surreptitously educational. Enjoy.
0143143492|5.0|Excellent audiobook of an excellent book. It is narrated by Echart himself. It's word for word dialog is a great way to get the teachings while driving or whenever reading is not convienient. If you're not familiar with Echart Tolle's teachings I highly recommend you read his work. It is certainly what mankind needs especially today. My self esteem has changed for the better dramatically. I'm at more ease with myself and I'm getting better as my understanding and application of these teachings increase. Life is so much better and problems are much easier to resolve. Get the book. Get the CDs.
B000001GGV|5.0|Sorry about that pun above.  Really though, this was my introduction to Pogorelich.  I am not one of those dweebs that doesn't want a performer to make artistic inferences that are outside the bounds of the composers written notes, therefore I appreciate Ivo.  I think this is the main reason he is such a polarizing character.  I have heard absolutely no one that is critical of his work, say he is unskilled or not technically proficient.  He has the finger strength to tear phone books in half and tremendous dynamic and tonal control.  However it is his interpretations of works that seems to drive previous said dweeb crazy.  I often find he sees an alternate layer or possibility within the compositions framework and exposes it to the horror of archival music skeletons everywhere.  Its not like hes playing different notes for crying out loud!  Its often just simple stuff like playing a little more staccato to emphasis the rhythm or something.  It's amazing that a genre that has as many so called sophisticated listeners just ends up being filled with cavemen that are afraid of fire.  At any rate enough about cavemen, this album is really wonderful if you are interested in virtuosity and genius interpretation, but not so wonderful if you want a Vladimir Horowitz stuffy snooze fest.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Specially if you are a musician, music lover or anything related to that. The movie is one of a kind with an original plot, great actors (the kid is amazing) and even if you don't like the story (which in my opinion is beautiful) it is all worth it just to hear the music... It should go for the oscar for best soundtrack wow. On the purchase there's no much to say since amazon's service has always been excellent on timing and quality of the products. Thanks once again.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I have never heard this album so clear in my life. The new songs are also great. Akon's version of \\"Wanna Be Starting Something\\" is almost better than Michael's version. I give a thumbs up
0143038419|1.0|This should have been titled \\"Journey of a Narcissist.\\"  What an irritating woman.  I have my doubts about how much of this is even authentic.  I just don't believe in most of the people she encounters.  I wonder if this is another made-up memoir.
B0000640RX|5.0|I saw Rambo first blood part 2 when I was about 14yrs old.  I still remember the cheers in the theater when Rambo was wasting the enemy.  This three disk trilogy set is well worth the money.  It not only has the first three Rambo films, but has lots of extras both on each movie disk as well as the additional disk with more extras.  These movies definitely bring back memories.  I hope this review helps.
1579125549|5.0|This book is a must have for anyone who is even remotely interested in the game. It starts off with simple checkmating patterns that even the newest player can understand, and then progressively increases in difficulty. But no worries! Even if you are wanting to learn how to play the game, this book teaches you that too! From setting up the board to winning the game, this book is quickly becoming a staple of everyone's chess library.
B000XPU5NY|4.0|I bought this under some hesitation as I have written off Phil Collins some years back and cringed at Genesis' latter works, but the track listing (most of it, anyway) sold me.  Brilliant Stuff throughout but all I thought of was \\"Seconds Out\\" from 30 years ago! Collins, Rutherford, Banks, Steurmer and Thompson Turn it On Again with this decent package of Live performances recorded LY in Europe.  Whether prog or pop, Genesis delivers the goods. Consistent and enjoyable throughout.  'In The Cage' stands out for me.   Shame, however, as Phil drops the F bomb on 'Invisible Touch'.   Oh well, such are the times.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|In a somewhat surprising development, Madonna turns over a lion share of the producing and songwriting duties to outside sources on HARD CANDY, reportedly her last full-length studio album for her longtime label Warner Bros.  The Neptunes produce 7 of the disc's 12 tracks, while Timbaland and Justin Timberlake helm the remaining tracks (with CONFESSIONS producer Stuart Price lending assistance throughout), in an obvious attempt to bring Madonna into 2008 and supply her with street cred to younger record buyers.  The first single \\"4 Minutes\\" (#3 US, #1 UK), is a Timbaland/Timberlake masterpiece (far better than most of the tracks on both of Timberlake's solo records), but Madonna's own participation is oddly minimal.  Based on that first single, listeners could not be blamed for wondering if Madonna was taking the Mariah route and becoming a guest vocalist on her own recording.    Fear not, after listening to the entire recording, Madonna is present first and foremost for the remainder of HARD CANDY, and the effort to pull her up to date works shockingly well.  Even though the tracks bare every hallmark of 2008 pop, even though the Neptunes' tracks do not differ drastically from the countless hits that they have whipped up for numerous other singers, and even though guest vocals pop up with relative frequency on roughly half of the disc's tracks, HARD CANDY still has Madonna's six-inch heel prints all over it.  Perhaps because her personality is much greater than the numerous pop singers who have emerged in her wake, Madonna (who does have a co-writing credit on every song, and had a hand in producing the Neptunes' tracks) seems to be able to personalize the material much more than the many other singers (who often become anonymous) when produced by Timbaland and the Neptunes.  No matter how valuable the involvement of others may have been to the discs success, HARD CANDY feels like Madonna's album, through and through.    A large part of that is possibly due to thefact that HARD CANDY is not far removed from Madonna classic sound at all.  In fact, this album is a true extension of the dance floor homecoming for the singer that began with 2005's brilliant CONFESSIONS FROM A DANCE FLOOR, and this is also Madonna's first album in over 20 years to completely drop the desire to be taken seriously and simply let the hooks rule the day.  A fan would have to go back before 1986's True Blue to find a Madonna album that completely disdains the political/moral/spiritual explorations and is solely concentrated on getting into the groove, but that's exactly what HARD CANDY does.  \\"Forget your troubles and dance, dance, dance,\\" may not be the best mantra to live everyday life by, but it sure seems to work for Madonna recordings.    Madonna's pre-EVITA girlish vocals make a prominent return on the opening \\"Candy Shop,\\" sort of bizarre mishmash of Madonna's own 1992 track \\"Where Life Begins\\" and Dolly Parton's 1975 hit \\"The Bargain Store,\\" and the disc never stops from there, continually playing to Madonna's numerous strengths as the ultimate performer of dance pop.  Perhaps Madonna's early work was an inspiration for the Neptunes' Parrell Williams, as the bulk of his seven songs are based in same foundation that brought us eighties' chestnuts such as \\"Lucky Star\\" and \\"Into the Groove.\\"  Three tracks that immediately stand out as classic Madonna are \\"Give It 2 Me,\\" a deliriously memorable dance track that is rumored to be the next single, \\"Heartbeat,\\" which gives Madonna's admittedly limited range a real work out, and \\"She's Not Me,\\" a stomping kiss-off to the numerous Madonna-wannbes, which covers similar ground to 1992's \\"Thief of Hearts\\" but much more successfully.  As up-to-the-moment as each of these track are, they would have fit right in on Madonna's 1983 debut album if one were to replace the drum loops with standard eighties synth lines, and that is a high compliment.     Madonna also reaches back even further to her earliest discoinfluences on Timberlake/Timbaland's \\"Dance 2night\\" and the Neptunes' \\"Beat Goes On\\" (featuring a pointless but harmless cameo from Kanye West), which, even more than 2005's CONFESSIONS, successfully realizes Madonna's daydream of being a vintage Donna Summer-esque disco belter.  Aside from \\"Dance 2night\\" and \\"4 Minutes,\\" the bulk of the Timberlake/Timbaland material provides the disc with its most introspective moments, and \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" and especially the closing \\"Voices\\" would not feel terribly out of place with the cool Europop of 1998's RAY OF LIGHT.  Perhaps the disc's most striking moment is the Neptunes' disarmingly honest \\"Incredible\\" in which Madonna appear to drop all pretenses and croon straight from the heart against the Neptunes' swirling techno backdrop.  With total sincerity, \\"Incredible\\" is not only the Neptunes' best work, but it also ranks among Madonna finest recordings.    Although it represents Madonna's most obvious grab at hipness, HARD CANDY is not at all the simple sell-out that it easily could have been and, in fact, may be Madonna's most ambitious album yet.  It's easily her most consistent album since 1998's RAY OF LIGHT (with only the underwhelming \\"Spanish Guitar\\" failing to payoff), and probably her most singularly carefree and effortless since 1984's LIKE A VIRGIN.  Although I personally cherish the depth that Madonna achieved with 1989's Like a Prayer and 1998's RAY OF LIGHT, it also refreshing to make the occasional return to straightforward decadence.  At the end of the day, HARD CANDY comes across as Madonna having fun, and her return to the pop mainstream results in an album that is about as great as 2008 pop can be.
B000J234RA|2.0|This is undoubtedly U2's worst album.  It feels like a homemade demo CD, or perhaps it's leftovers from the vastly superior Achtung Baby.  Regardless, it's not a particularly good CD, poorly crafted, written, and performed.  The first single, Numb, feels like a backing track without any enhancement.  While this can work sometimes in music, it doesn't here.  It ends up feeling cheap.  Lemon is a little better, but still has that cheap, sinking feeling.  The best songs on the album are Stay, Faraway, So Close (from the Wim Wenders film), The First Time (a lovely ballad), and the great closer, The Wanderer.  The Wanderer is a great U2 song, with stunning lead vocals by Johnny Cash and a great, brooding lyric that reads like Cash wrote it himself.  The CD booklet cover art is stunning as well, like the cover art in Achtung Baby and Pop.  If you're a U2 completist, pick it up.  If not, you can safely ignore it (except for The Wanderer).
B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna apparently took the criticisms hurled at 2003's dire AMERICAN LIKE album with considerable seriousness, as she does an almost complete about face of 2005's CONFESSIONS, returning to the club music that initially transformed her into a global superstar.  Madonna's attempts to be political and serious minded have not been completely abandoned (particularly on \\"Like it or Not\\" and \\"Isaiah\\"), although she never becomes nearly as heavy-handed as on past efforts.  Even Madonna's somewhat awkward rants on materialism (\\"Let it Will Be\\" and \\"How High,\\" which feel somewhat hypocritical coming from a multi-millionaire) sail on their strong hooks and airy production.  That last tidbit is perhaps the crucial component to CONFESSIONS' success, as Madonna has returned to crafting a solid collection of songs rather than simply relying on heavy handed moralizing and endless production gimmicks.    In order to maximize the club-like atmosphere, all 12 tracks are segued together into one 56-minute party.  Ditching Mirwais Ahmadzai (who produced Madonna's previous two albums) in favor of Stuart Price was an invaluable decision, as CONFESSIONS feels like Madonna's most organic and least-forced album in years.  Each track has an almost immediately likeable quality, with the international hits \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump\\" and the 2005 concert opener \\"Future Lovers,\\" in particular emerging as three of the decade's best pop recordings.  The only real downside to the album is that, given that the tempo and mood of the disc rarely changes, the songs begin to become interchangeable as the album nears to its close and leaves the tracks sounding more samey than they really are.    Internationally, the album was a huge smash selling over 8 million copies worldwide (1.7 million in the US) and returning Madonna to the #1 position on Billboard's Hot 200 in the states.  Overall, CONFESSIONS was greeted with very positive reviews from both critics and fans, although some certainly felt that Madonna wasplaying safe with the set and that the disc was not in the same league as the major titles in Madonna's catalogue, such as LIKE A PRAYER or RAY OF LIGHT.  The lead single \\"Hung Up\\" became an international chart-topper, landing in the Guinness Book of World Records for hitting #1 in 45 separate countries.  The single peaked at #7 on the Hot 100 in the US, becoming Madonna's 36th Top Ten single.       Although \\"Sorry,\\" \\"Get Together,\\" and \\"Jump\\" were all huge international hits, the singles inexplicably failed to connect with the American mainstream, with \\"Sorry\\" stalling at an unimpressive #58 and \\"Get Together\\" and \\"Jump\\" both failing to even crack the Hot 100.  Perhaps the US population just wasn't in the mood to dance in 2005, as the lackluster performance of these three singles is very perplexing.  Particularly that of \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Jump,\\" which would probably be considered crowning achievements in Madonna's career if they had only performed more successfully stateside.  Of course, Madonna had no such problems on the US Dance Chart, where all four of the album's singles justifiably hit #1 without difficulty.    CONFESSIONS remains a crucial recording in Madonna's discography, as it showcases the singer/songwriter returning from the brink of disaster with an extremely engaging and satisfying set.  The album features a set of sturdily constructed dance-pop confections that are consistently solid and listenable.  Although the disc lacks variety and becomes a touch too monotonous before its conclusion, the goodwill and studio expertise of Madonna and producer Stuart Price successfully navigate the disc over such obstacles.  Besides, you'll be dancing too hard to care anyway!
B000002L7J|5.0|The Smiths only released a handful of albums, but most of them are masterpieces or near masterpieces.  This is their 2nd best behind The Queen is Dead.  It has arguably their most famous single, How Soon Is Now?.  Many have made fun of St. Morrissey because of his \\"tawdry whining\\", but who would disagree with the chorus here that \\"I am human and I need to be loved!\\"?  Only an arrogant, nihilistic punk who prides himself on feeling nothing.  Many are just afraid of someone like Morrissey, who really lays it all out and dares you to touch his soul.  I've stated in other Smiths reviews that his lyrics are much wittier than most people give him credit for.<br /><br />There are other brilliant gems here.  I love the song What She Said with its brilliant, incisive lyrics.  While I do adore How Soon Is Now, my favorite track here has to be Barbarism Begins at Home.  There's only a small lyric by Morrissey, but it's one of Marr's most memorable melodies.  And despite my propensity for devouring meat, I do like the song Meat is Murder.  It's actually quite haunting despite its preachy lyrics, one of the few Morrissey lyrics that I can honestly call preachy.  But this is a minor point with a band that I like more as I grow older.  Teen angst?  No!  Human angst, yes.

So inspiring, informative and well written that I would recommend it to anyone regardless of your political persuasion.  I was just learning about Senator Obama when I picked up this book, but it definitely piqued my interest in him.  I can see that he must have been a wonderful professor, he seems a natural teacher and this book shows not only that aspect, but his sense of humor and intelligence.

0307265730|4.0|It's good to see Jhumpa Lahiri working again in the art form that best suits her temperament, the short story. Although \\"The Namesake\\" garnered much attention and a movie, it was for me ultimately a failure as a novel, as too many small moments stretched out over too long a span and collapsed from boredom and exhaustion.<br /><br />These stories, however, work very well. Lahiri gives us just enough small concrete moments and perceptions to sustain the experience of loss and of what the immigration experience means for those who are transported into the west from India. The characters are precisely and neatly drawn from closely observed but telling details. The subtle and not-so-subtle encroachment of U.S. culture and life into the India mindset, with its subsequent fallout of loss and emotional ambiguity, is clearly captured here.<br /><br />This talented observer and careful writer is at her best again. I highly recommend this collection for everyone.

0061091480|4.0|This book makes me think of the Johnny Cash song, \\"I Walk the Line\\" and Arlo Guthrie's \\"Walking the Line.\\"  I walk the line in that I feel there are parts of this book that are very helpful to other parts that I feel are far from being helpful.<br /><br />The parts I didn't feel were helpful were Dr. Dyer's tone of seemingly \\"just getting over\\" problems.  I have heard Dr. Dyer and on one occasion he tells an audience member who had suffered profound losses to \\"get over it\\" and maybe that person could \\"write a book about those losses.\\"  That did not sound very helpful and not everybody is in a position or has the ability level to become an author.  However, the rest of the book has good, practical tools of empowerment.<br /><br />The parts I most related to were the passages on not nodding one's head and pretending to agree with something contrary to one's integrity, beliefs or values.  If there is one thing I absolutely detest, it is sycophantic behavior and faux agreement.  I don't even pretend to laugh at jokes that I don't find funny!<br /><br />To its credit, this book can be seen as a tool of empowerment.  It outlines a list of self defeating behaviors and some ways of counteracting them.  It is not a nostrum nor is it a panacea for all personal ills.  It is simply a check list of areas in people's lives where challenges are likely to occur and alternate ways of meeting those challenges.<br /><br />I think of John Lennon, who introduced himself on the Beatles' 1963 Christmas album, \\"John here, speaking with his voice!\\"  There is more truth than humor to the Chief Beatle's quip.  John never lost his own voice or integrity.  He, as Dr. Dyer points out \\"didn't need their [world at large] approval\\" to recognize his own worth as a good individual.  He did not have to sacrifice or compromise his identity and core values and beliefs for anyone.  Dr. Dyer goes into this advanced stage of esteem development in the chapter entitled \\"You Don't Need Their Approval.\\"<br /><br />The title of this chapter can be misleading.  It is best not to read into this the fallacy that you can bluff and pretend that you neither want nor need approval.  That is not true.  Everybody wants, needs and deserves approval.  The main thrust of that chapter is that one need not do things ONLY for approval - let approval be the byproduct and not the impetus.  It is about acceptance of one's self and decisions without making approval be the motivator and by keeping it the byproduct.<br /><br />Nobody can respect a sycophant and it is doubtful that sycophants respect themselves.  Sacrificing one's voice to appease those in charge or those whom the sycophant wants to win over is a price that I feel is not worth paying.  The Apple Polisher, as is described in this book waits around for others to voice their opinions, only to chime in as an echo.  One does not need permission to have their own opinion and I think it is very sad whenever people feel they have to take this approach to survive socially.  Dr. Dyer gives an example of a person who does just that.  Readers come away with no respect for the person acting as an echo and that serves as a wake up call to everyone to follow John Lennon's example by speaking in their OWN voices.<br /><br />I think of people like Lech Walesa, Robert Kennedy, Pope John XXIII who did what they believed was right and in turn changed the world for the better.  Many disagreed and even opposed them and what they wanted to do.  They stayed true to their core values and beliefs regardless of anyone else's approval and effected great changes in the world.  I think that helps to clarify the approval question.<br /><br />All in all, a decent book.  No doubt many readers will come away stepping over many erronenous zones.sleading.

Anyway, see it.  And although it's a puppet movie, it's definitely not appropriate for kids.  And if you're a bit leary of sitting through a puppet movie, surely the songs will reel you in, like \\"America--F*&% Yeah!\\" or the \\"freedom costs a buck-o'-five\\" song.  Enjoy! :)

B00132D808|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album. I am, unlike others, new to Panic at the Disco and I have no idea what their first album was like but I am going to investigate it, however I am a mellow chap and I am filled with cheer to read that some refer to their new album as an unexpected delightful change and puzzled that others, to the point of almost being appalled, say the change is for the worse, as it differs from the punk/rock spirit their first album apparently had.     I'll relish this album always, as I am more a mellow indie kid than anything else and this albums jolly, wordy-ness inspires my imagination as it trips along some sort of never-ending sensual delight, buoyant and jovial. The band members strike me as true artists because they seem to have embraced every musical style while injecting something quintessentially their own. Their obvious enjoyment in what they do is felt in this recording. I heartily recommend their second album!    Also, their video to their hit single 'Nine in the Afternoon,' is fantastic work, very witty and hilarious!
B00006F7S4|5.0|I have always thought of Beck to be a playful artist full of twisting, hooking rhythms and generally silly lyrics.  I was shocked to discover that Beck has a songwriter's soul on par with the greatest.  I would be even more shocked to learn that he came up with these nuggets in a short span of time, because some artists would take lifetimes to write such beautiful fare.  The first six tracks put you into a bright hopeful haze.  They are not dirges but more songs of love lost yet love on the horizon.  Lyrically, I find this offering to be the best he has ever created.  I would put this album at the top of his career, for the first vinyl it is perfect to my ears.

However she recognizes him as Ian a friend of Bones, who she still loves.  For Bones, she lets him go and thinks back to her hometown in Ohio where she and her lover Bones the vampire killed the governor for selling girls to vampires; her grandparents died in the slaughter and she was considered a mass murderer.  Don her current boss knew she was a half breed and placed her on his special top secret team to eliminate vampires.  She left Bones a goodbye note.<br /><br />Don informs the team of a graphic murder in the Ohio house that belonged to Cat's grandparents; a note left behind states: \\"Here Kitty Kitty\\".  Someone knows of Cat.  She and her team travel to Licking Falls to look at the crime scene.  One corpse contains limestone from a nearby cave, which leads Cat to believe Bones is involved.  She enters the cave alone.  Seven vampires greet her with one explaining the bounty on the Red Reaper.  They bring her beloved to her, but it is not Bones.  Instead it is a creep she dated once as a teen.  She kills the vampires, but not before a member of her team dies.<br /><br />At her friend's wedding Cat and Bones meet for the first time since she disappeared four years ago.  She explains why she left and he tells her Ian wants her, but will not attack her; he will go after her loved ones.

0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion is thought-provoking and inspiring.  Its lucid arguments helped to clarify many of my thoughts and internal contradictions that I've been struggling with since I was approaching confirmation in 8th grade.    I especially recommend the first four chapters which make a solid case for atheism.    The rest of the book explores why there is religion in the world and isn't quite as strong.   Chapter 5 on the root of religions meanders a too much without coming to a crisp point like its predecessors.  Chapter 10 \\"A Much Needed Gap\\", starts with a contradiction from a preceding chapter (described in detail in my The \\"Good\\" and the \\"gap\\" discussion post.    However, despite these flaws, many good ideas are introduced, and a solid foundation is laid for either Dawkins or someone else to continue to close the gap to an understanding of how an atheistic world can include the good items that have been historically intertwined with religion.
B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Didn't click until the third or fourth listen, when I could focus.  Large, scary music.  La Gibbons' voice goes from little girl to cracked, quavering banshee and everything in between.  Threads and The Rip are compelling.  Like old age, this is not for sissies.
B00005JPS7|2.0|The special effects were excellent.  There were moments of comedy, and the plot was decent.  I particularly appreciated the attempt to support nonviolent action.  The acting by Jeff Bridges, Robert Downey Jr., Terrence Howard, and Gwyneth Paltrow was amazing- though some credit needs to go to the make-up job as well.  I was racking my brain, for I knew I'd seen these actors before, but they did such a good job of embracing new characters, of becoming characters, that I lost sight of the actors themselves.  This had the makings of a great movie, for its genre.<br /><br />There are some glitches, however.  Repeatedly people go into Stark's chest cavity without a sterile environment- when everyone knows this is just a recipe for infection and disease.  There are difficulties with how fast the villain learns how to use the weapons.  But of greatest difficulty is the dating of the material.<br /><br />Honestly.  We are in the 21st century.  Do we still need caricatures of people groups appearing as incompetent buffoons and inherently evil?  This film reads as if the director took his cues from Shaheen's [[ASIN:1566563887 Reel Bad Arabs: How Hollywood Vilifies a People]].  Nearly every classic point of Arab stereotyping in Hollywood is followed by this movie.  A full third of the runtime is spent with the evil Muslims and Arabs, yelling in Arabic and killing people and thirsting for more weapons.  All of this takes place in Afghanistan, but there seem to be few Afghanis around.  It's a multinational terrorist force, run mostly by Arabs, and in Arabic.<br /><br />Sure, it's only a comic book movie. I'm not expecting the in-depth real-life drama of the Afghani [[ASIN:B0012OX7EO The Kite Runner]].  But comics and the movies- indeed all of popular culture- have the ability to greatly influence us.  This after all is the goal of anyone who creates a quality movie.  Indeed, this has often been the maxim of The Great One - Stan Lee (who incidentally has his best cameo ever in this film).  Stan Lee often speaks of how much comics can influence culture, that they should not be viewed merely as comics.  He often very purposely puts his crusade for justice into the midst of his characters and stories. Sadly, some don't take the words of the author seriously- that his stories matter, that justice matters.<br /><br />There is of course the courtesy good Arab guy who initially helps Stark out, but we barely know he's Arabic.  He looks less swarthy, he's a polyglot, and rarely speaks Arabic.  In mannerisms and culture he acts like a typical American- letting us know that Arabs are alright as long as they are so much like us that we don't have to realize that they are Arabic.<br /><br />As my stomach turned, I kept hoping that the movie would somehow redeem its initial treatment of Arabs, perhaps showing us in some way how the Arabs in the movie came to desire weapons, because their homes were trashed by the Americans and Stark was selling weapons everywhere.  Evidently no redemption was possible.  With one exception, the only people Iron Man kills are Arabs, but there are thrilling moments of him going out of his way to rescue Americans who were attacking him.  (By this point we've obviously lost the hope for the non-violent focus that was initially so promising.)  The coup de grace is the line from the ultimate villain to the head Arab villain, that \\"their part of the world\\" has never been able to keep up technologically.  It's not just that the Arabs are villains.  They are bad villains.  They can't even do that right.<br /><br />The issue of course is not one movie.  It is rather that, in the thousands of movies that Arabs and Muslims have been shown in in Hollywood history, nearly all of them have been stereotypical or negative portrayals.  (About fifty have been positive.)  And Iron Man has suddenly risen to the top of this infamous list.  There was no need to use Arabs and Muslims in this modern portrayal of the Iron Man myth, for there areplenty of other villains around.  If Arabs were to be the villains, there was no need to show them as stereotypes.  If Arabs and Muslims were to be the villains, the directors could have taken this opportunity to show how they are also humans, and there are reasons that they turn to a life of violence.<br /><br />If you see this movie, consider as you watch it if every single Arab or Muslim in the movie was replaced by a Jew.  It's not so far-fetched.  Movies of the 30s commonly had the stereotypical Jew in the role that Arabs and Muslims now fill all too often today.  But we now realize portraying most minorities as stereotypes and over-the-top villains is wrong.  Thank God we now know this is anti-Semitic, and have rejected such racist portrayals.  Except Arabs are Semites too.<br /><br />This movie had the directing, acting, and writing to have a lot of potential.  As it is, it will show all over the US and confirm American prejudices of Arabs and Muslims.  Then it will show all over the world, and confirm Arab and Muslim beliefs of what we think of them.

B00005JPS7|4.0|Robert Downey, Jr. is terrific as Iron Man. His character, billionaire Tony Stark, builds weapons for the U.S. military. Stark doesn't even realize that it is his own WMD's that are being used for 'evil' until he (spoiler alert) is kidnapped early on by Afghan rebels. Downey is absolutely terrific as Stark. It is the actor's ability to balance humor with drama that actually carries the film all the way through to its' conclusion. The special effects are also dynamite, and the Iron Man suit creation is awesome. The plot has good twists, and there is enough great excitement (in the first hour especially) and light humorous touches that also keep me glued to the screen. Like all movies about good vs. evil, though, there are usually some problems as to how the director defines the 'bad guys'. The action begins in Afghanistan when Stark is kidnapped (no more spoilers, I promise). The men who kidnap Stark are supposedly rebels, and at first they are pretty frightening. But low and behold, when all is said and done, we discover that these 'Arab' rebels are nothing more than more stereotypical villains that we have seen in countless movies before, and they are not very smart, either. You even have the bald, steely-eyed Arab who has murder in his eyes (and lucky for us he speaks pretty good English). As for villains other than the predictable 'Arabic' bad guy, the writers have thrown somebody else into the pot, so that is a relief. Still, I wasn't content with the supporting cast. Terrance Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, does a good job with what he has, which isn't a lot. And the always gorgeous Gwyneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts (Stark's assistant), is engaging to look at. Her light humor and sex-appeal adds a lot to what could've been a heavy-handed story involving all men and action. Unfortunately she seems to have little to do. Every great superhero film that I know of always takes advantage of the 'love interest' (Lois Lane, Mary Jane Watson, etc.). I hope she will have more to do in the sequel. The same goes for Howard. And Jeff Bridges, wearing a bald head and a beard, is excellent as always, and a perfect foil for Downey's Stark. But it is Downey who really holds the film together. And despite the stereotypes and an action-packed ending that gives me pause, or a sense of deja vu, as if I had seen that same ending in some other summer movie last year, and the lack of things to do for Howard and Paltrow (is there some kind of romantic entanglement between Pepper and Tony Stark?), 'Iron Man' really is a great popcorn film. Downey gives us pretty much a 'one-man show', and he is nearly perfect.

B00005JPS7|4.0|As usual, I didn't know a thing about Iron Man before going to see it. I'm one of the many who probably hasn't read the comic books. And as a smart person said when we were sitting in a (very packed) cinema, 95% of the people in the cinema wouldn't have read the comic books either.<br /><br />So what did I know about Iron Man? Well, from the endless photos of Gwyneth Paltrow looking gorgeous, wearing very short skirts, and very high heels, in the press, I guess that she has a small role in it? I didn't see any photos of Robert Downey Jnr promoting the movie, it all seemed to focus on Gwyneth's very long legs.<br /><br />From the impressive beginning, you know that Iron Man is going to work. Although the VFX do feel similar at times to Transformers (done by the same company, Industrial Light & Magic, don't you know), it succeeds where Spiderman 3 spectacularly failed. Not only is Robert perfect for the Tony Stark/Iron Man role, he's cute as well. Hello!<br /><br />The story is basically like this: Tony Stark is CEO of Stark Industries, which produces really hi-tech weapons for the military. After his father's death, Tony inherited the company, and is now a billionaire. He has a fancy house, and a love for women. Who he then gets his assistant to throw out once he's finished with them. When in Afghanistan to demonstrate a new weapons test, his convoy is attacked, and he is injured, and taken hostage, but his life is saved by a doctor. When the terrorists force Tony to reproduce the weapon, he builds an impressive suit of armour, and escapes. The suit gets destroyed but is rebuilt in the US, where it gives Tony what else, but superhuman strength. He wants revenge.<br /><br />The special effects & technology used in this movie will absolutely blow you away. I mean, wow! It's absolutely breath taking. I'm not going to ruin this movie for anyone who hasn't yet seen it, but go, go, go! The action scenes in themselves are unreal. Not only do they work, but they take your breath away.<br /><br />The supporting cast was amazing. Gwyneth played the part for Pepper really well, and even managed to run a little in skyscraper heels. How does she manage it? I can barely walk in heels never mind run. Terrence Howard I have a feeling might get a bigger role hopefully in the next movie, it's certainly hinting that way. Jeff Bridges as the bad guy was unbelievable. The bald head really gave me the creeps, and gave the character an extra something. He's a seriously unlikeable character, and makes you root for Tony even more. And for all those reviewers who have complained that Samuel L Jackson is listed in the cast, but doesn't appear - hello duh??? I'll give you a hint. His scene was not left on the cutting room floor. He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.<br /><br />I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.<br /><br />All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.ast was amazing.

He does appear. You just have to find the fast forward button. Put it this way, there will definitely be a sequel.    I cannot wait to get this movie on DVD. Hopefully, it will be two discs (no bare bones DVDs for me!), loaded with extras and I want LOADED!!! I want to know how they did this, how they did that, and I want to see Robert in training. Woohoo. They can go all out with the extras on this DVD so lets hope they do.    All I can say is go see this movie. You will not regret it.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|I love her music and I've been a fan of L.M. for a long time, but seeing this performance on the DVD has given me a new perspective on her talents - she is just an amazing lady.     This most interesting and exotic collection of musicians and musical instruments set in one of the most beautiful architectural structures I've ever visited is an enchanting and perfect combination.     My only regret is that I was not at the Alhambra for that magical evening...but I was absolutely spellbound viewing the performance on the DVD while sitting on my sofa.    This is one of my best and favorite musical purchases.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have been a fan of this series for a while, I was glad to get this series on DVD.   The only problem is during shipment the DVD's will come loose from the case.. so open carefully. 4 of mine fell out.
B000002H33|5.0|i love this cd, as well as metallica and this album is one of the many  reasons why i like them. all of the tracks on this album are good. my favorites are battery, master of puppets, welcome home (sanitarium), disposable heroes, and orion. if your a metal fan (which i know most of you are), then this album is probably a must have for you.
B00139W3NE|2.0|Any artist that produces a work that features the theme that wicked and dour adults grind the \\"magic\\" out of children has not been in a classroom full of 14 year olds lately.  Put director Weitz or novelist Pullman in any local middle school for a single school day and they would go screaming into the night.      Nicole Kidman was the best thing about the movie.  Dakota Blue Richards was pretty weak.  I liked the bear better when it was a lion in \\"Narnia.\\"
B00004R9A4|5.0|I love this movie, ever since I was a kid. And it's just as good now as it was then. A must have for every home.
B000CNET2K|4.0|How Awful About Allan (1970)--TV movie starring Anthony Perkins whose guilt over a family tragedy leaves him blind and mentally ill. At the start of the film, he is released to the care of his sister, but does she have an agenda of her own? Perkins is good, but it felt extremely long at 74 minutes. **<br /><br />Dementia 13 (1963)--An ax murderer at a family reunion in an Irish castle and a daughter-in-law who is trying to cover up her husband's death to keep from losing her portion of the inheritance. Produced by Roger Corman and Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, it will remind you much more of one of Corman's Edgar Allen Poe movies than anything Coppola did, but not bad if you don't go in expecting The Godfather. ***<br /><br />Maniac (1934)--Barely coherent movie about a lab assistant that murders his boss. Has some nudity, which was taboo back then (the Hayes Code don't ya know), but women were ugly back in 1934, so it will bring you no joy to see it. Highlight is title character plucking out and eating cat's eye. Sucks hind teat. *<br /><br />The Screaming Skull (1958 b/w)--Opening scene shows coffin and explains that the film studio insured patrons against dying of fright watching the movie. You'll probably be all right. Recent widower marries former mental hospital patient and takes her to \\"charming\\" villa in countryside where she hears spooky sounds and sees spooky things, but then in the morning, they're all gone, she can't prove them, and there are leering suspicions she might be slipping back into insanity. But could it the supernatural? Or her husband (hint: almost certainly yes)? Leading lady has the face of a middle-age woman, but a dynamite body, so the director has her moping around in lingerie a lot. Tedious, but not completely unwatchable. **<br /><br />The Killing Kind (1973)--John Savage stars as anti-social psychotic who is released from prison after serving time for rape. He lives with his mother with whom he may be carrying on an incestuous relationship and in his spare time kills the people who put him behind bars. Then, he kills some other people for no particular reason at all. A movie in exquisitely bad taste, it should satisfy exploitation diehards. Look for small role by Cindy Williams of Laverne & Shirley fame. ***1/2<br /><br />Anatomy of a Psycho (1961 b/w)--A 50's-ish JD film about a teenager out for revenge against the people who testified against his brother, who was justly convicted and executed for murder. He frames another teenager for a crime he himself committed. Actors playing teenagers were in their mid-thirties, but one scene in high school reveals that they're students. Pretty dull. No psychos. I think they titled the film as a cross between Anatomy of a Murder (1959) and Psycho (1960). *1/2<br /><br />Tormented (1960)--In opening scene, Tom's sexpot mistress Vi threatens to expose their affair if he abandons her for the gawky, plain jane fianc&eacute; Sandy. Vi loses her footing and dangles from ledge. Tom neglects to save her (\\"How unfortunate you accidentally fell to your death Vi and couldn't blackmail me\\"). She haunts Tom as he prepares for wedding on small island off California coast. Directed by Bert I Gordon, who also directed dopey monster movies Empire of the Ants and Earth vs. the Spider. This one is a little long, but is actually pretty entertaining, with a nice noir vibe running through it, which is supported by some modern jazz. ***<br /><br />Craze (1974)--Jack Palance runs an antique store in England and worships an idol in the basement. The idol delivers good fortune when Palance offers human sacrifices. Although an obvious whack job, he has a cute chubby girlfriend about 20 years his junior. Pretty dumb, but watchable. **1/2<br /><br />Twisted Obsession (1989)--Story pretty murky, as is the lighting on this one. Jeff Goldblum plays screenwriter in Paris, who agrees to write a screenplay for young filmmaker because he sleeps with the filmmaker's attractive younger sister. A twisted obsession ensues, but coherence does not. Would have been a nice low budget thriller if it did. **<br /><br />The Sadist (1963)--Serial killer played by Arch Hall Jr. is based on the exploits of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend Carol Ann Fugate. They take three people hostage at a rural California gas station. This film is a cult classic and the image is decent. Truth be told, it's pretty dated and Arch Hall Jr. overacts throughout, but it's still worth a look. ***<br /><br />Overall, I thought this was pretty good public domain stuff at a very reasonable price. I bought it mainly to get cheap copies of The Sadist and Dementia 13, but I'm really glad I got to see Tormented and The Killing Kind as well, which I had never even heard of before.een a nice low budget thriller if it did. **    The Sadist (1963)--Serial killer played by Arch Hall Jr. is based on the exploits of Charles Starkweather and his girlfriend Carol Ann Fugate.

B0011NVC9I|4.0|I loved it, of course it was total high 'camp', especially the part with Beowulf naked and yet there always being a convenient object to cover his manhood !! When the Dragon dropped him and his posterior stopped an inch from the castle spire...I laughed SO much !!<br />Filmed using the same techniques as Polar Express, but this is not for kids ! It's very gory with an abundance of cleavage. Not that there is anything wrong with that.<br />One thing I want to make clear, yes Anthony Hopkins looks like Anthony Hopkins, but only in Ray Winstone's dreams does he look like our star. Ray is like me, stuck in his 50's, but how wonderful to voice such a virile, young, hunky character. Sort of Dorian Grey turned inside out !!
B0013HA838|5.0|ETA: Thank you, Amazon, for clearing up the review mess.     Wonderful, funny and very well sung Figaro. Only small quibble is the sound quality which comes and goes. There are notable singer 'fall-outs' in act one and the act three sextet is slightly marred by a Curzio that is much too loud. It's not enough for me to subtract any stars from this review, though.    Schrott and Finley make the best pair of Figaro/Conte I've ever heard (or seen *ahem*) and I must admit to really liking Schrott's unorthodox way of singing. It takes a bit of getting used to, but it ends up working very well for him. This guy is just so energetic! Persson's Susanna is deliciously feisty and 'take-charge' - the character can often end up getting on my nerves - this one doesn't. Röschmann is a matter of taste, I think. She can definitely sing, but I'm not a big fan of the sound itself.     All in all this is one of if not *the* best Figaros I've seen or heard (despite the flaws in the audio) - in no small part thanks to David McVicar's wonderful stage directions - this guy really knows how to squeeze out every ounce of character from his ensemble. I've seen local  and - to me - familiar singers (at the Copenhagen Opera) do things on stage that I would never have thought possible - if they've got it, he'll get it out of them.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I am very happy with this product. It delivered everything it promised, as well as, even though the picture is, most of the time, in gradated colours, is excellent quality. I found nothing wrong with the audio, and listening to Johnny Depp singing was breathtaking... although that credit goes to Mr. Depp himself; the disc delivered excellent quality all around, and made it a stunning viewing experience.
B000VECAEO|5.0|I never get to see the reruns on TV, so I have forgotten how truely funny this show is, I enjoyed it very much.....

0805066691|5.0|The recent HBO movie based loosely on this book did no justice to these wrenching stories describing the decimation of the American Indian.  Can it be that whites simply cannot comprehend the Indian culture and the tragedies tribes endured at the hands of the Great Father (as were called American presidents) and his minions?<br /><br />Visit a tribal reservation and you'll witness firsthand impoverished Indians, beaten down to a shadow of their once proud selves.  Brave and fearless, they fought hard for the right to live in their homelands.  True conservationists, they could not comprehend our greed for land.  Said Chief Joseph of the Nez Perces, \\"The earth was created by the assistance of the sun, and it should be left as it was. . . . The country was made without lines of demarcation, and it is no man's business to divide it. . . .\\"<br /><br />Dee Brown's magnificent book should be required reading for all studying American history.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|Bellow the quality of single episodes. A reviewer in this page called it \\"a series of random scenes mixed together\\". Add to it that the link between the scenes is weak at best. Even the scenes are poorly conceived. In one occasion a crew fires hundreds of round of military munitions aboard the spaceship without putting a single scratch to the ship.  In another one, 2 men move a rock-slab of a several tons by just pushing it. Not to mention Teal'c miraculous marathon, ran at a speed compared to a spaceship.  There is some entertainment value, specially considering the link to the TV series. And that is why I gave it more than Zero.
0810993139|5.0|Our  review is for the book called Diary of a Wimpy Kid. It was written and illustrated by Jeff  Kinney. The Genre is a graphic Novel, With comedy  Gregory Heffley  is a wimpy kid.

It is on our top 10 list because it is hilarious book. Anybody who reads it would laugh. So read and you will see.
B000TGCR38|4.0|This very different WWII film has more plot twists than a Harry Potter novel but nevertheless it is very entertaining to watch. Set in German occupied Holland, the intrigue and deception being played out by almost all of the primary characters makes it very difficult to sort out the good guys from the bad until the film ultimately does it for you at the end.<br />A plan to trick wealthy members of the Jewish community into a false escape plan in order to rob them of their valuables sets the plot in motion and the architects of this evil are not necessarily the usual suspects. The movie deals in people pretending to be what they are not and it is never dull.<br />For those looking for historical accuracy and plausabilty in a WWII film, this may be a disappointment which explains some of the negative reviews. If on the other hand you are looking for a twisiting plot with lot's of action this isn't a bad choice. Let's face it Casablanca isn't exactly historically accurate either but it's considered a classic. Black Book is far from a classic but it's pretty good.
055358202X|5.0|A FEAST FOR CROWS is the fourth installment in Martin's Song of Fire and Ice fantasy series. I find the depth of characterization and intricate plotting in this series fascinating. Characters continue to grow and evolve; they are all very multi-dimensional. The political and personal intrigue is always interesting and, at times, breath-taking. Martin's prose is very good throughout. This latest book continues to exhibit these qualties.<br /><br />Was I a little letdown by this volume. Yes, a little. Some of the key characters have been left out due to considerations of space, and will re-appear in the next book. Also, the action has (inevitably) slowed a bit. No major battles are fought in this one. That's OK, though. I was not at all bored. You can see the foundations being laid in this book for future action. The intrigue continues apace and more than a couple of characters meet unpleasant fates. Events continue, but on a more personal scale. This one is a little more deliberate than previous books, but it was never dull, As to omitted characters, they're scheduled to re-appear in the next book.<br /><br />While some readers seem to have found A FEAST FOR CROWS disappointing, I very much did not. In any event, if you've gotten this far in the series, I'm sure you'll want to know what happens here as it is bound to be an integral part of the cataclysmic events still to come. If you're not into the series yet, go get the first book and get started. You won't be bored. I just wish they could bring them out faster.
0790729407|4.0|This is a well produced and well written film that tells the story of Michael Collins and the Irish Rebellion and subsequent civil war with great historical accuracy and drama. Liam Neeson is unforgettable in a role he is absolutely perfectly cast in as Michael Collins. Most of the rest of the cast does very well with the exception of Julia Roberts who seems out of her league here but mercifully doesn't hinder the enjoyment of the film all that much.<br />The tensions that erupt between Collins and Eamon De Valera (Alan Rickman)form the heart of the film. It is a chapter in Irish history that lends itself well to dramatic treatment and the film lives up to it's raw material.Nice work from director Neil Jordan.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|When I listend to the samples before I bought the album, I was dreadfully expecting an album of twelve versions of American Life (the song, not the album). I was pleasantly surprised when I listened to Hard Candy. The only weak song on the album is Candy Shop, a dull attempt at pure hip hop. From 4 Minutes to Voices, the album is a non-stop jam. The highlights: Give It 2 Me, She's Not Me, Incredible, and Beat Goes On, which I'm hoping is her next single.   Madge has been around a long time, and she certainly is not going to stamp her name on a pile of sh$t. I absolutely love this album. It actually puts a smile on my face with its pep and cheeky lyrics, and it manages to sound modern and nostalgic at the same time. I am going to get some flack for this statement, but Hard Candy is Madonna's Thriller!
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Let me start this off by saying that the only reason I even finished this is because of wanting to see how Daniel Day Lewis could even star in such a boring movie and I just new \\" there would be blood \\" at some point.   I have not felt the desire to write a review on a movie in 8 years... until I saw this.   I started out thinking:   Blood?  Daniel Day Lewis ( DDL ) , cool.. he is a great actor, and I love his past work... however is what went down.   Well, there was some blood, twice?  and for what reason?  Who knows?  My major gripe:  over half an hour of this movie is spent showing how crazed and nuttty the Christians are.  the Christianity is portrayed as a bunch of loons, which is untrue!   It almost made me turn it off, to tell you the truth... it gave the impression of the \\"political correct\\" view of Christianity as seen by a socialist.  The director shows the preacher healing with his hands.... yelling crazily, .. calling on Jesus to save you, as if it was some sort of CULT or crazy group.   DDL's character was made to profess Jesus, and he rolls his eyes and acts as if he is being raped!  or even beaten in the face... yes, he gets slapped in the face by the \\"mean old Jesus professing person\\".  Why is Jesus and anyone who believes in Jesus constantly made to be the bad guy in movies - ESPECIALLY THIS ONE?   SPOILER ALERT :  the mean old JESUS person is the ONE of the 2 people that \\" THERE IS BLOOD \\" from.  He dies at the end, by the hand of DDL ' the hero \\" yay.  yay for the Jesus hater.   Clap clap.   .....DDL proclaims \\" I am finished \\"  after he kills the preacher that he just forced to deny GOD.  He made him deny God louder and louder about ten times in a row, then he beats he head in.... wow.  how nice.   it's an anti Christian movie.   AVOID THIS DRIVEL.   I wish that DDL had not been in this movie and therefore I would not have ever had a desire to see it nor waste my time.   I wish I could give this minus 100 stars... and my Dad watched and helped mewrite this review, too.  He agrees.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This is the best thing by REM in  a long time.  Just short, quick  and tight rock and roll songs.  Hard charghig like good old  rock songs that end fast and  tight and dot't fade out.  NEAT STUFF!!!
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|I would recommend this to a new fan of The Doors if you haven't heard them live. Jim is in top form here. He sings with such passion and care. The band is incredibly tight here too. If you are just discovering The Doors i recommend getting the new Perception (small box) set. This set is afforable for most, if not for you then get each album sold seprate. Each album has its gems to me. There are only two songs i don't like in the entire Doors catalog of songs. Put on a good pair of headphones sit back relax with a joint or beer and enjoy The Doors live in Pittsburgh.
B00005JPS7|4.0|Cool. That is one word that describes this movie. Exciting and fun are another two. Robert Downey Jr. was nothing but excellent at playing Iron Man. He exhibited wit, intelligence, that playboy charm and charisma: the works for a superhero. Although the plot was not strong, and there were a few holes or weak areas, the movie was excellent. But, the plot did not matter that much. This is an origin story and it was all about the characters, they are the ones that move the story forward.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges was one cold blooded arms dealer, and he was great at it. I just wish we would have seen more of him. Terrence Howard was ok, not the best part of the movie. Paltrow was cute in her very capable performance. But the story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man, and it was good. The action sequences and the special effects were excellent but did not dominate the film, which I was grateful form.<br /><br />This movie managed what many movies have not been able to do: balance. The action and special effects are enough to keep the movie going and highly entertaining, but the character development is what drives it forward, what gives it form and meaning. This movie is a must see, it is fun, funny as well, and has excellent performances.
0375424474|5.0|There are many aspects to the body that make us human. Limbs, eyes, stature, genetics.  None of it just happened.  And this is evident by looking at all those that have come before us.  By clearly showing how evolution is decent with modification, Neil Shubin shows how we can better understand the whys and wherefores of our own bodies by looking at the structure of simpler organisms, namely fish.  An excelent example (to me) was the examination of the cranial nerves.  I remember them from my anatomy class as seemingly tangled and I couldn't understand why they were so random.  But by looking at embryology, fish, and many other aspects of comparative vertebrate anatomy, I now understand how beautifully arranged they really are.<br /><br />Shubin examines many examples like this, showing how the fossil record show evolutionary history, and how many of these conclusions have been drawn in his field. Included are examples of how body plans form, limbs form, teeth end up in the mouth (my 4 year old loved this chapter and insisted I read the whole thing aloud to him), and how the ear is formed.<br /><br />The book is engaging, entertaining, and informative. The author strikes an excellent balance between not talking over the audiences head and not dumbing down the information. Recommended for anyone interested in evolution, paleontology, body plans, and examining many of the missing links that have been discovered.
B0015D3Z4O|3.0|The songs on this album are not bad...they are just way too hip-hop influenced for Madonna's taste.  She should have kept this album dance/electronic related.  Pharrell and Justin are too present on this album...I want to hear Madonna and ONLY Madonna singing.  Standout tracks are: \\"Heartbeat\\", \\"Miles Away\\", \\"Incredible\\", \\"She's Not Me\\", and \\"Beat Goes On\\"  These songs however, would have been MUCH better if not for irritating Pharrell Williams adding his two cents (I cringe when I hear his obnoxious \\"Ooooh!\\" during \\"Incredible\\"...eww!)  Madonna, Madonna...please stick to your dance roots...no hip-hop.  Without the hip-hop flavor, this album would have been fantastic.  (Take a lesson from your album Music)!!
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeplin is it. Zeplin is old school.  The best rock in my opinion.  My previous Physical Graffiti CD broke.  & I thought Amazon will get me a new one fast.    Thank you Amazon.

B000056NX5|4.0|This is the best version of this musical I've seen.  I watch this for the musical and vocal content only, and though it does have some truth behind it, do not compare it to the gospel itself.  So, if you're looking for a good show, then grab it.  If you're looking for pure truth, grab a Bible instead.
078401213X|5.0|A real film noir cult classic in black and white. Not for the squeamish, this sci-fi thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat as you follow Maximiliam Cohen on the quest for the most important discovery of his life. He's trying to decode the numerical pattern beneath the ultimate system of ordered chaos -- the stock market. He teeters on the edge of insanity, and he uncovers a secret for which everyone is willing to kill.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|Everything that could be said about this film has already been said, so I'm not going to go into the details. I loved the film and I just wish it was longer. When I bought the dvd and was watching it, I could have sworn part of a scene with Anthony and Lucy/beggar woman that I saw in the theater in the movie was cut from the dvd. The scene is heard on the highlighted version of the cd. If I'm right about this, it makes me wonder if other scenes have been cut from other films transfered to dvd. BUT! Don't let this little enigma stop the purchase/rental of this film. I was also a little disappointed with the special features. I was hoping there would be deleted scenes and bloopers which make it even more entertaining. But again, don't let this sway the purchase/rental. I thought it was excellent and in my opinion, both Depp and the film itself should have been awarded that elusive Oscar as well as Burton for Director.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is a truly amazing video collection.  My whole family was in awe of what was captured on video.  It's a must have for every household, especially those with children.  My grandchildren have received this set from me.

0743496736|5.0|This was the 5th and best book I have read by this author.  She really captures the dynamics of high school.  She captured the reality of the struggle to be popular and the darkside of being bullied. Plan a weekend.  Lose yourself in this book.
B00102F5WK|5.0|Excellent movie.  Well done and full of action.  That our government is engaged is this is a condemnation of the leadership that we currently suffer.  That the movie can be produced is a tribute to what is guaranteed to us: freedom of speech and freedom of expression.  It is a must see for anyone who cares about our country.
B000IHYY52|5.0|If you want to impress your friends with the best possible quality image, just show them this BD. And it's only 1080i!!!. You can see the minor  details of the hair, faces, instruments of the artists, the texture of the clothes, all.    But the image is so amazing that you can forget that the musical pieces in this blu ray are also fantastic.    The only pity is why they don't commercialize all the complete shows one by one in high definition. I'd buy all of them.
B000TNF7NS|5.0|Yes, the sound here is \\"Way\\" better than the  previous released domestic versions; but I personally prefer the sound of the BGO remastered version to this one.  The BGO release packs more of a punch with Schenker's guitar and Way's bass right up in your face.  This release is a bit more \\"listener\\" friendly with Mogg's voice and the more treble laden sounds coming through more prominently.  What may make this attractive for the diehard fan is the bonus tracks.  Michael live is Michael live, 'nuff said. Plus, the price is so much more reasonable than the long out-of-print BGO version (what's another $15 bucks?).  So if you own the BGO version, you may be a bit disappointed in the overall sound, but pleased with the bonus material.  For a newcomer to the band, add this to cart ASAP. This album rocks and features one of the best guitar players on the planet. Oh, and while your at it, add \\"Phenomenon\\" & \\"No Heavy Petting\\" to your cart too (what's another $30 bucks?)!!
B000000WA2|1.0|After the era-defining and diverse Parklife album, Blur went on to create the Great Escape. Somewhat cynical in tone lyrically, it is clear to see a band on the brink of implosion with the excessively perky arrangements. The lead single Country House was released on the same day as Oasis's Roll With It. Oasis made it to the number one spot subsequently winning the 'battle'. And rightly so, Country House's smirkiness was not what the public wanted and they preferred Oasis's (then) working class authenticity. Overall, Th Great Escape is an over the top, theatrical mess and completely grating. Blur ended up releasing 1997's selft-titled album which, stylistially, was a complete reverse of The Great Escape and saw them embracing American indie-pop amongst other genres. And thank god they did!
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The title says it all.      This is by far the best cast, Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast are  perfect as ValJean and Javert.  I bought this recording specifically for the cast having watched the original concert.  If you love Les Mis, or even if you are a first timer - you should be buying this recording.    My next purchase will be the accompanying DVD!
B000002JNN|5.0|the shipping was prompt and the cd was in very good condition when it arrived.
0553108034|5.0|Awesome follow up to \\"A Game of Thrones\\". I read 250 pages in the first day, (was sick with a flu) and it was a great read. I can't wait to start the next book in the series.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|What a waste of time and money! I made it through about 10 minutes before I got a headache and had to lay down. Paramount should rot for making a terrible film. Unless you like home movies and a jumpy screen. I'd rather pill out and walk in traffic than sit through this again. What torture!
B000002AGM|4.0|And the result is this terrific CD. This was the first recording of the Davis-Evans collaborations, so the sound seems more tentative and experimental than their later work. The songs too are not among Miles' more familiar repertoire, so it is hard to tell if he is reaching the type of interpretation and effect that he is trying for. I guess that's why when I played this at a jazz-themed poker party of mine, two neophytes asked me why I was playing \\"elevator music\\". (Lucky for them I didn't put on [[ASIN:B000GQLAZW Metheny / Mehldau]]!) Still, the recording is clean, the music is good, and (hey!) it's Miles Davis (man). Try it, you'll like it.
B0010VD7EO|4.0|I recently worked on MGMT's video for \\"Electric Feel\\" and it was the first time I had heard of them or of any of their music. I've worked on enough videos to know that if everyone isn't sick of the song by the middle of the day, it's a pretty good track. It was the first time I'd ever been on a set where everyone was either dancing (well, as much as you can dance while you work) or singing or humming the song to themselves. I liked the song a lot myself and was pretty curious to hear the rest of the album to see if it would be that good.<br /><br />After listening to it, I decided that \\"Electric Feel\\" is the best track on the album with the rest of the songs being similar to an old, comfortable blanket to wrap around it. I think that the cover of this album is a very fitting image for the music on it. The rest of the songs sound retro but not in a disco way like \\"Electric Feel\\", but more like the sound of late 60's/ early 70's psychedelia. It's very easy to just sit back and relax while you listen to this. It's got a sound that you can either chill to or move along to if you so desire. I've listened to the album twice already and other tracks that stand out for me are \\"Kids\\", which sounds like early 80's electronica and \\"Of Birds, Moons and Monsters\\" which definitely fits my earlier description of 60's/70's psychedelia and in my opinion is a close second to \\"Electric Feel\\".<br /><br />I really, really like this album. I'm gonna go ahead and give this album a strong thumbs up in the hopes that those looking for a new band to listen to will maybe check these guys out.<br /><br />(As for those curious about the video for \\"Electric Feel\\", it's still in post-production at the time of this writing but should be released within the next couple of weeks. Watch out for it because it's gonna be pretty weird and cool.)
B000EGDAI4|4.0|This CD is a treat from start to finish. I like the mix of well known and not so well known songs, and I especially like Moritat (\\"Mack the Knife\\") for its straight forward delivery, true to the original rhythm and swing, and a saxophone solo by Sonny that is unparalleled in recorded jazz history. I've never had any issues with Van Gelder re-mixes, and I can confirm that there are a few blips here and there, but I don't consider them distracting and the music can still be easily enjoyed. Fans of sax jazz simply must buy this recording, and I don't see how any serious fan of jazz can be without it. If you are looking for something to broaden a non-jazz oriented music collection, I think this might be a good candidate for you, simply because the music is so much fun. Let 'er rip!
B00005JPS7|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Tony Stark is a billionaire industrialist and genius inventor who is kidnapped and forced to build a devastating weapon. Instead, using his intelligence and ingenuity, Tony builds a high-tech suit of armor and escapes captivity. When he uncovers a nefarious plot with global implications, he dons his powerful armor and vows to protect the world as Iron Man. The cast led by  Robert Downey Jr. (in a terrific career-defining performance as Tony Stark / Iron Man), Terrence Howard (as Jim Rhodes), Jeff Bridges (as Obadiah Stane / Iron Monger), and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Virginia 'Pepper' Potts) is excellent! The directing by Jon Favreau (who also directed \\"Elf\\" (2003), \\"Zathura\\" (2005), & \\"Made\\" (2001) is excellent! The screenplay (which is based on characters by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber, and Jack Kirby) by Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby (both who also wrote the Oscar-nominated screenplay for \\"Children Of Men\\" (2006), Art Marcum, & Matt Holloway (both who also wrote the story and screenplay to the upcoming \\"Punisher: War Zone\\" (2008) is excellent! The music by Ramin Djawadi (who also did the music to \\"Mr. Brooks\\" (2007) & the tv show \\"Prison Break\\") is excellent! The cinematography by Matthew Libatique (who also did the cinematography to \\"The Number 23\\" (2007) is excellent! The film editing by Dan Lebental (who also did the film editing to \\"Elf\\" & \\"Zathura\\") is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn & Randi Hiller (who also did the casting to \\"Vantage Point\\" (2008), \\"Never Back Down\\" (2008), & the upcoming \\"You Don't Mess With The Zohan\\" (2008) is excellent! The production design by J. Michael Riva (who also did the production design to \\"Zathura\\" & \\"Spider-Man 3\\" (2007) is excellent! The art direction by Suzan Wexler (who also did the art direction to \\"Spider-Man 3\\" & the upcoming \\"The Soloist\\" (2008), which also stars Downey, Jr.) is excellent! The set decoration by Lauri Gaffin (who also did the set decoration to \\"Zathura\\" & the upcoming \\"Land Of The Lost\\" (2009) is excellent! The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon (who also did the costume design to \\"Elf\\", \\"Zathura\\", & \\"Made\\") is excellent! This is an action-adventure comic-book movie that works on all cylinders. Robert Downey, Jr. was born to play Tony Stark / Iron Man. This is one of the best films of the year, if not, the best, by so far, this year. This is also a excellent movie to start the summer movie season off.
0380820846|1.0|Ever since I read \\"The Viscount Who Loved Me\\" I have been trying to enjoy Julia Quinn's other books. Try being the operative word. I agree with all the other readers that gave this book two stars, I could not continue reading and had to put the book down. I skimmed as much as I could and could not get myself to continue. How could this be the same writer as TVWLM? The book was completely insipid. It is evident why Penelope is a spinster, who could be attracted to her? She has such poor self-esteem issues. And Colin, he seems underdeveloped and sounds like a younger brother to me. This book reminds me so much of \\"On the way to the Wedding\\", it seems Julia likes to repeat the characters. She is falling into Stephanie Lauren's trap. Really, been there done that and really didn't like it. This book is so boring- or rather the characters were so well common. So this leads me thinking, Lady Whistledown is Julia - she likes to observe people and she does a good job as she writes with a discerning ability only people who are very detailed oriented and observant can do so I understand why she is compare to Jane Austen. And there are some very few parts of the book she shows cleverness and witticism. However, she is not constant in her ability to deliver the \\"seduction\\" aspect of romance book. She writes about puppy love more times than I can remember. Her heroines have self-esteem issues which is very unattractive - ask any guy. She is so belittling at times, Penelope seems pathetic and self-effacing, which makes her a bit sour and ungenerous. In a word, a involuntary spinster no matter how much she convinces herself. And she loves Colin for no other reason than his mere existence compells her to love him?? For an seemingly educated person she seems a bit dumb in her head and misguided. Grow up Penelope! What do you know of love? You hide yourself and enjoy blending into the background. You have no life and live vicariously through others, how pathetic? You admire Colin because he has more guts than you, he travels and tries to find himself. You well you wait for something to happen to you. I would not waste my money on buying this book I wish I had not.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I'm not a big TV-watcher, and am more than sick of the reality shows and shallow dramas that have taken over the American airwaves.  I got into Veronica Mars just as her fans were fighting to have her back for a 4th Season. This series, and especially the first season, is CAPTIVATING.  It is smart, witty, and stars a powerful atypical heroine who can fend for herself -- and is a GREAT role model for girls and women. (A refreshing change to other \\"role models\\" we can choose from). I was glued to my TV set watching all 3 seasons, and must admit my family, including my brothers as well, looked for any excuse to pop the VM DVD in and continue watching it together. In fact, Veronica Mars has multitudes of fans all over the world.    CW cancelled the show, and substituted such gems as \\"A Farmer Wants a Wife\\" and \\"Pussy Cat Dolls.\\" >:(  A network needs to pick this show back up ASAP - we fans are dying out here without it!

B000N4SHPS|4.0|Unlike others, I don't see a need to post yet another recap of the storyline...<br /><br />Stallone and Rocky have been tremendous inspirations in my life. They helped me get into shape once, in the 1980's. And I'll likely use this inspiration once again, in my 50's, to get back into shape.<br /><br />My first reaction to the news of another Rocky movie was \\"What the heck?! Is he going to be in a wheel chair?!\\" I waited till I could buy the DVD at a local store for a good price.<br /><br />The movie was ok.. I think they did all the right things, considering the star's advanced age, etc.<br /><br />I am somewhat crestfallen to read that Sylvester Stallone has resorted to using Human Growth Hormone in order to be in shape for the Rocky and Rambo movies.<br /><br />That is just another indication that Stallone is too old to play those characters any more.<br /><br />My advice to Stallone: retire those characters. Concentrate on what you can do with your body, naturally.<br /><br />Hopefully you've earned enough from your previous career that you can retire in reasonable comfort.
0670018651|3.0|This book wasn't all that I'd hoped but I'm still happy to have it in my library. I enjoy wearing fragrance and find it to be an essential part of my \\"wardrobe\\". Many of the fragrances that I wanted information about (history,notes, etc.) were missing and yet many that I'd never known of were brought to light.     I have, since reading this book, ventured into unkown perfume territory and I look forward to the experiences that I will undoubtedly have, both good and maybe not so good.
0743496736|2.0|I enjoy Jodi Picoult's books. However, this book drug on for me. Not only that but I knew 1/2 way through what was going to happen.

0321544080|5.0|I'm in awe of people who can take great pictures with seemingly little effort.  But in reality, those pictures are a combination of skill, knowledge, and not a small measure of luck.  Joe McNally, a very well-known photographer who has shot for Time, National Geographic, and others, \\"converses\\" with the reader in The Moment It Clicks: Photography secrets from one of the world's top shooters.  You'll find out how his mind works to control lighting and scene to make those famous images.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Shoot What You Love; Keep Your Eye in the Camera; The Logic of Light; There's Always Something to Bounce Light Off Of; Joe's Lighting Tips; Joe's Camera Bag; Joe's Grip and Lighting Gear; The Barroom; Glossary; Index<br /><br />This book was born from a workshop where McNally was presenting.  He was sharing gems of experience, when it dawned on one of the attendees that capturing these nuggets of wisdom could be a perfect method for letting everyone get into the mind of a great photographer.  The format of the book consists mostly of two page spreads.  The right side shows the photo, and the left side is McNally sharing the story behind the image.  Not only does he share what it took to get the picture, but he also gets into the technical aspects of how it was lit and shot.  So much of what he does is based on lighting.  Too much, too little, bouncing off items, focussed lighting, ambient, etc...  When you get done, you'll never look at light in quite the same way again.<br /><br />Will this book allow you to replicate the same types of shots that have made McNally famous?  No.  For one, he has hundreds of thousands of dollars of equipment, and often has a budget to do things like renting elephants and hanging people from helicopters.  My guess is that you don't have that working for you.  Also, he doesn't use a \\"do this, then this, then this\\" approach.  He does talk about the equipment and settings, the lighting and circumstances, but it's more as if you were sitting in a pub talking to a best mate.  If you're not experienced on camera technology and terminology, you'll also miss a fair amount of the value.  But if you've done some work and become more than just a tourist with a camera, this can take you up another level or two.<br /><br />Or you can just look at the pictures and marvel that it's possible to do those kinds of things with a camera...a best mate.

B00005NNMK|5.0|I'll start off the review by admitting that this is the only Europe album I have actually heard, I will not compare it to other efforts of the band.    This album is perfect in almost every way. The production is top-notch, the melodies are powerful, the rhythm section is neither overpowering nor lost in the background, the choruses are catchy with vocal harmonies all over the place, add some of the most amazing guitar solos you'll ever have the pleasure of hearing and a healthy dose of cheesy keyboard and synth effects, and you have the making of the perfect melodic rock/metal album.    Truth be told, the band doesn't do anything that hasn't been done before. But they do it so well that you just don't care if you've heard the same damn formula thousands of times before. There are no fillers here, just track after track of exceptionally well written hard-rock (and I do stress on this point, the band doesn't do anything new yet blow your mind every time the song hits its climax) with a ton of hooks, all the while without overwhelming the listener. That's not to say that the band doesn't go \\"out there\\" every now and then. There's even a little jazz/blues keyboard/guitar jam somewhere in there.    John Norum's guitar solos are unbelievably well done, having the right mix of face-melting shred and heart wrenching melodies. You'd think that statement could be true to most bands of the 80's, but the solos on this album will change your mind.    My only notable complaint with the album is the lack of any real riffs (the band was heading into a new direction), surprisingly for an album of this type, it doesn't suffer much of that drawback. However, if you're a listener who demands some headbanging in his/her music, you won't find much of it here.    There's no denying there's a strong \\"commercial\\" vibe throughout the album, but that's typical of albums from the late 80's scene. And in my personal opinion, it only serves to make the album even better. However, if you're a listener who loathes any sort of poppiness or commercialness in his/her music, might want to start looking elsewhere.    To sum up, this album is a definite classic and a must-have for (almost) anyone who's into melodic rock or metal. This album simply never gets old.

B00122M2QU|5.0|Another solid record by Max Cavalera.  I really like the fact that this CD is straightforward and aggressive.  Each song builds on the next and the formula works.  This is what Max needed, pull it together with his past comrades and rock on!!!
630529142X|5.0|This is Adam Sandler at his best playing a goofy waterboy. Kathy Bates as his overbearing mother was hilarious, the scene with his bed sheet pegged out is just class, I have never laughed so much.  This is an absolute must see for all Sandler fans.
B0000640VO|1.0|Amélie is a frenetic bore that insists on its audience's adoration while making no demands upon their intelligence. The story is simplicity itself: Amélie (Audrey Tautou), a waitress, lives in a strangely depopulated, deracinated Montmartre and longs for love. A waif with bobbed hair and pooling eyes, Amélie looks like a silent-movie heroine, and for two tiring hours exercises an emotional range redolent of those primitive early entertainments -- she smiles at the camera, widens her eyes, crinkles her mouth. Because the film's director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, is more of a watchmaker than a poet of the heart and soul, however, there is no mystery to how she finds love, only a series of intricately choreographed, Rube Goldberg-like set pieces in which Amélie flips the switch. This is too bad not only because Tautou can actually act (she's charming when she's not twinkling as she goes in for the kill), but because she was Jeunet's best chance to take the chill off his film, to modulate his relentless technical virtuosity with the pulse of real life.

B000YPUF9W|4.0|If this movie could have hundreds of zombies running around who were played by real people, why couldn't I Am Legend? This is a movie where CGI was used effectively and without butting into the main plot of the movie. I didn't particularly care for the second in the series, but this one and the first \\"Resident Evil\\" were my cup of tea.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|TestAmenT is back & THANK GOD is still in top form after a killer album that was 'The Gathering!' This new CD was a long time coming & like I said previously, thankfully TestAmenT is continuing in the same musical form as their last album...brutal songs, well crafted & top notch production! What I like about this album though is that it's more upbeat this time around, not too dark & dreary like the last album tended to be at times. Also, it's nice hearing Alex Skolnick soloing again like in the good ol' days! Thrash fans check it out!
B00005JPTK|4.0|I have to agree with those who are sick and tired of the CGI effects replacing real people. I enjoyed the movie, but I had its moments when I just wanted to stop it. I enjoy most of what Will Smith does, but this was a bit over the top with the terrible CGI characters who were supposed to be zombies.<br /><br />I bought it, and now wish I'd just waited for it to come on cable. It's just not one of those flicks I'd watch over and over again.
032147404X|5.0|This is my kind of book!  If I wanted to wade through tons of theory, I would get one of the 400+ page photography books on the market; I really don't have alot of time for all of that.  I know some purists out there will scoff at this kind of book, which, along with Volume 2, get to the meat of the subject.  I personally find getting to the meat of the subject extremely helpful.  This allows me to not only get a particular shot I am looking for with a minimal amount of figuring things out, but it also provides a great stepping stone for me to experiment more and go beyond.  And I personally enjoy his humor.  More than once, I got a good chuckle at some of his remarks.  The looks of the book are nice as well.  Each page gives a wonderful photo example, as well as Scott's take on a particular photographic subject, instructions, and helpful advice.  I own several books by this author, and have not been disappointed by any of them.
B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and prejudice is a literary masterpiece. by the author ,who according to the known biographical research led a very modest and unremarkable existence, but has produced a remarkable novel. It reflects the  social scene of the English society , its behaviour and social customs  which to a degree is a pattern still followed up     in today's world. It is such a delight to see pursuit of love and marriage with honorable intentions and without sexual scenes. The psychological insight makes the reader unwilling to put the book down. The CD follows the text faithfully and the cast performs beautifully. Highly recommended!
037571457X|4.0|Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood and Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return by Marjane Satrapi are very well written novels that effectively describe the author's experiences while growing up in Iran during the Iranian Revolution, the Iran-Iraq War, as well as many other historical events.  I really enjoyed reading Satrapi's childhood account of such dramatic events in Iranian history, and the comic book format made the memoirs even more enjoyable reads.  The innocent and sometimes ignorant perspective of a child is a very positive way of broadcasting such terrible and negatively viewed events in a way that everyone can understand them.  Satrapi definitely does an excellent job of enticing her audience while also giving them an accurate and perhaps new way of looking at history.       I would recommend Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood and Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return to anyone, whether they are students wanting to learn more about historical events in the Middle East, westerners who do not comprehend the many struggles Iran has faced, or just an average person looking for a dramatic yet accurate read.  The historical events that are depicted within these graphic novels are very easily viewed in the eyes of such a mischievous and driven child, and her account is one that anyone can associate with and learn from.  Despite the apprehensive atmosphere created by the mounted unsettlement of Marji and her family as well as the captivating and simple drawings that accompany the text, Marji is always able to demonstrate great strength within her family, and becomes fully aware of the perils of her country through trial and error, just as the reader does when they witness the overwhelmingly inspiring account of a little girl growing up during such a divisive point in history.  After reading such a powerful message, one comes away with not only a greater view of historical events of the world, but also has a greater respect for all storytellers, no matter howmuch of a minority they may appear to be.

B00000J2SO|5.0|Down to Earth captures the spirit of the previous three Rainbow albums and the commercial approach of the soon-to-be pop band version.      I don't CARE if the lead singer for Rainbow's fourth album isn't as good as Ronnie James Dio, I *love* Down to Earth!    Graham Bonnet doesn't have the pleasant sound or the amazing vocal range of Dio, but everything else that made the first three Rainbow albums so enjoyable is STILL here- quality songwriting, amazing guitar playing, lengthy and epic songs, etc.    You have a couple pop songs (that were both the biggest hits from the album- which was probably a bad idea because they give people the impression the band sold out or something).      I really like the lengthy, epic guitar-dominated tracks (\\"Eyes of the World\\" and \\"Danger Zone\\").  They remind me of previous frantic and intense guitar workouts such as \\"Stargazer\\", \\"Light in the Black\\", and \\"Gates of Babylon\\").      Then you also have just really good guitar playing on the shorter songs, such as \\"No Time to Lose\\", \\"Makin Love\\" and \\"Love's No Friend\\".  These songs also contain memorable vocal melodies.   My personal favorite song is the speedy closer, \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" with its soaring chorus and fast-paced guitar playing.    Overall, wow, this is certainly an underrated album.  It's closer to the first three Rainbow albums and therefore rules a LOT.

The Spice Girls couldn't quite carry a tune but the music was fun and carefree, songs I liked: Wannabe, Say'll Be There, 2 Become 1, Who Do You Think You Are?, and Naked. You can say this cd was a guilty pleasure but heck this debut album from the euro pop girls was a lot better than their second album.

Great renditions of You Learn, Joining You, Head Over Feet, I Was Hoping, and Uninvited. There's a cover of Sting's classic, King of Pain and a couple of unreleased tracks. Alanis has a great and unique voice and her lyrics are complexed but straight to the point. Can't wait for her new cd, Flavors of Entanglement!

Berlin's songs are great - \\"Be Careful, It's My Heart,\\" \\"I'll Capture Your Heart,\\" the one about Lincoln and Washington, and of course, the best one, \\"White Christmas.\\"  The story line is cute also (I do love happy endings, and everyone can be a star!), and it just seems a fun picture!.[[ASIN:B000I0QL82 Holiday Inn (Special Edition)]]

B00005JOHC|5.0|This is the perfect comedy series, so far.  It is well written and truly funny on several levels.  Sheen's comedy delivery is perfect, so the Charlie character is fun to watch.  Cryer has a knack for making the audience enjoy and appreciate his character's failures and injuries.  The kid character, Jake, marks the first time I can recall in which one feels no sympathy for a child that is not cute, that is plagued by hereditary stupidity, and who will always be a burden on society.  Instead, he is funny.      I hope the writers will be able to come up with new material and avoid the failure that eventually kills a lot of comedy shows-the eventual replacement of original humor with too much crudity.
B00005LC1H|5.0|LOVE Basil & Sybil Fawlty!  Classics.  Now that I live in Mexico and speak Spanish, I can appreciate more of the banter between Manuel (\\"He's from Barcelona!\\") & Mr. Fawlty.  \\"On these trays\\" \\"Oh, no, Mr. Fawlty!  No 'on these trays, uno, dos, tres!\\"
B000ZLFALI|2.0|OKAY...So many people talked this up to me and said \\"You have to see this movie really stoned or on drugs\\". The only reason that statement could be legit is because for SOME PEOPLE, weed just dumbs you down incredible amounts. But, even weed did not save this movie for me. It's like the script was written by someone who has absolutely no creativity, no depth to their personality (since their characters and plot have none), and absolutely no experience with what real life is ACTUALLY like. The portrayals of people, romance, war, England, being in a band, hallucinating, etc etc were all a complete embaressment!  And then, just becuase they use drugs in the movie, it tricks people into thinking \\"this is one of those really messed up, really DEEP - trippy movies\\" but it's not...I feel like the people who have made it have never used a drug in their life, which is NOT the case with most drug movies...ala Fear and Loathing, Trainspotting, Requiem for a Dream, etc etc etc.<br /><br />The movie attempts to make a statement and emotional impact, but all it does is causes you to laugh at how hap-hazzard and weak it's attempt is. What's the statement? People are at war in the world and it makes people sad? People die and it makes people sad? Why do you care about any of these characters? There is absolutely no depth to anything. How can you care about anything that happens to any of them?<br /><br /> The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile are the segments where they have costumes and settings that are actually semi-creative. Particularly, the segment during the song \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" is probably the only impressive segment in the entire film. Unfortunately, to me, most of the effects-laden segments are just lackluster attempts at recreating the intense presentations we got with MOULIN ROUGE. And the \\"hallucinogenic\\" scene...anyone who has FINAL CUT PRO could create that in 5 minutes. There's absolutely no creative thought put into it. OOOOOOH COLOR CORRECTION - how innovative and worthwhile. NOT. I could excrete a better musical in one sitting. Don't waste your time with this mediocre garbage. Do yourself a favor and watch SWEENEY TODD instead, or ONCE, or even the new HAIRSPRAY.<br /><br />And as far as MUSICAL standards go, C'MON! The songs were for the most part very boring renditions of classics, and the stuff that was going on on the screen was not impressive or entertaining in the least! Barely any synchronization of anything! The coreography was so weak! It was like watching a really bad music video the entire time! A really boring one - that has like some decently talented people in the effects department, but then it's like the person in CHARGE, directing, is mentally disabled.<br />There were a couple really really cool sequences but it wasn't nearly enough to save the movie.

B00151HZME|4.0|What an exciting new album from M83! It seems M83 has decided to mix their futuristic sound with a little bit of the past in this new entry to their catalog. From the album cover serving as an homage to teen movies of the 80's, to the new wave song structures, atmospheres, and synth sounds, you'll get a pleasant mixture of feelings from this!<br /><br />As expected, the album is extremely tranquil and paralyzing, the majority of the time. You'll definitely get the ethereal floating you're probably hoping for as a longtime m83 fan. For those unfamiliar, I would say expect a nice cross between Air and Orbital, with a pinch of your favorite 80's pop on this record.<br /><br />The record opens with a nice therapeutic feeling track, \\"You, Appearing\\", but then bursting out immediately with a swirl of energetic sounds and portrayed colors with \\"Kim & Jessie\\", one of the standout tracks of the album. Next up is my personal favorite song on the album, \\"Skin of the Night\\", which features guest female vocals that are intensely angelic. The track feels like it SHOULD be the theme song to THE LOST BOYS 2 if someone was cool enough to make it this year. Other standout tracks include \\"Couleurs\\" which is the danciest track on the album and is most reminiscent of classic techno like Orbital and the likes. Also, \\"Up!\\", is the other track featuring the same female vocalist who really makes this album the ethereal ride is needs to be.<br /><br />The only weak parts of this album that stops it from getting the higher rating, is that it boasts \\"Graveyard Girl\\" as it's single, which is, in my opinion, the cheesiest and weakest M83 song in their entire history. It's another one of those tracks that is an obvious throwback to New Wave but unfortunately the chord progressions he chose to use will have you feeling like you've already heard this song a million times before, and there's nothing about it that really gives it it's own character or makes you want to listen to the song again. Other than that, the album itself doesn't really flow that perfectly all the way through, it feels more like separate unrelated tracks, plopped together for a release, but you can't always expect perfectly flowing album structures!<br /><br />In the end, a wonderful release from M83! One of my favorite listens of the year so far, aside from the new Portishead, which is absolutely great. M83 is one of the more important artists in electronic music right now and anyone who's not a fan yet should take the time to check it out. Also, listen to 2005's \\"Before the Dawn Heals Us\\" - a wonderful, wonderful album.self doesn't really flow that perfectly all the way through, it feels more like separate unrelated tracks, plopped together for a release, but you can't always expect perfectly flowing album structures!

B0015YDK1Q|2.0|As a real Mana fan I can tell you this is enjoyable. However being objective I find it very hard to recommend this. Mana has become a product venture for the music company. Just look at the track record.  Since the last live album 1994's \\"Mana en Vivo\\". Mana has had 10 cd releases. 4 original material cds; 5 CD versions of greatest hits and 1 Unplugged. This cd will have been a lot better if they applied live material from their last 14 years of original material. A third of the songs for this live album has been done in Vivo. What happen to Corazon Espinado or Angel de Amor. This would have been better if it was a live 2CD set with the latest material (95-87). Instead they rely on nostalgia. The two new songs are not that great either; One is a remake of a song from Marco Antonio Soliz which is a pretty good remake and the other original song was probably a left over from the recording sessions of their recent album. No new ground broken here. I would recommend to get the DVD \\"MANA ACCESSO TOTAL \\" to see the full experience of MANA live.
0786856297|5.0|I just finished reading this with my 12 year old niece and we had such fun.  The author writes in a humorous tone, especially the chapter titles.  Amy was studying Greek gods in school at the same time, so she figured out what the characters would do as we encountered them.      I just ordered the next two in the series....  can't wait!
0060935464|5.0|I never saw the movie. I never read the book until this year. To think what I missed over the years almost makes me cry. The reader gets caught up in the family life of Atticus, Scout and Jem. You root for the underdog. Not a fast paced book, the reader is nonetheless caught up in the intracies of Southern living and Southern morals in the 1930's. It is not a book to be overlooked.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|For fans of the band, another brilliant album that ranks up with their finest. Elegant, intelligent, ethereal...a great album from a great band.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I'm going to keep this short.  If you love Pink Floyd, you'll love this.  If you can't get enough of David Gilmour's amazing guitar magic, you'll love this.  If you liked Gilmour's previous dvd, \\"Meltdown\\", you'll love this even more because Richard Wright is in full display for the entire concert.  Hearing the \\"On An Island\\" material live gives it a whole new feel.  Fresh, relaxing and stunning.  There's a brilliant version of \\"Fat Old Sun\\" that ends with some of the finest lead work DG has played in years.  Oh... and he plays \\"Echoes.\\"  That should say it all.  Buy this or you'll be kicking yourself for letting it rest on the shelves at Amazon.  Just buy it.  End of story.
B00004TS0E|1.0|Maureen Ohara related that during the filming of the original, everyone knew it would be successful because they could sense how much heart was in the film.  Heart seems to be something very difficult to generate in films these days and this remake is a good example.  The film is competent, but heart is replaced with cutesy and smarmy. Hopefully this film will pass into oblivion.  I doubt that 60 years from now anyone will be calling it a classic, that is, if it's still being shown. If your new to movies and heard about how enjoyable \\"Miracle on 34th Street\\" is, they're talking about the originial.
B000UD0ESA|5.0|The best movie/script ever produced/filmed. Everything builds up to get to its climax and cry together with Rutger Hauer/Roy Beatty in one of the last sequences of the film. Remarkable moments are the street pursuit/death of Zhora and the conversation of Roy Beatty with Dr. Tyrrell. To view hundreds of times over and over again. The best performance belongs to Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford´s is probably the best performance ever.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I really was beginning to despair, watching the new seemingly paired-down-for-Yankee-taste version of the old Masterpiece Theatre. \\"Cranford,\\" however, adapted from Elizabeth Gaskill's novel, has restored my faith.<br /><br />By turns comic,  poignant, tragic, and romantic, this series has everything that not only makes one feel awfully good but also keeps one wanting more. With its host of Dames and Baronets--e.g., Judy Dench, Eileen Atkins, Michael Gambon--the cast can hardly be termed 'peerless', but it is, nevertheless, faultless. Ensemble acting at its best!<br /><br />\\"Cranford\\" is a scrumptious feast for the eyes, the mind, and the spirit.
B0000VD04M|4.0|The performances in this movie are all 5-star.  I knocked off one star on my overall review, because the movie just wasn't quite as entertaining as I thought it could have been.  Johnny Depp plays Ed Wood and does a wonderful job in the role, but Martin Landau stole the show with his portrayal of Bela Lugosi.  You forget you are watching Landau and actually start believing you are seeing Lugosi.  The movie is shot in black & white, which I thought would be a big downer, but it didn't detract from the movie in the least.  I forgot I was watching a black & white movie.  Ed Wood struggles and struggles and you keep hoping he will make it big, but you know in the back of your mind that he is never going to.  A lot of people will probably pass up this movie because it's not a big exciting extravaganza.  It's not really inspirational.  It's not funny, other than a couple of light moments.  In many ways I would say that it is a wonderful tribute to a man who never gave up on his dream.  His persistence and his lack of ability to never make a really good movie has earned him a unique place in movie history.  Perhaps not the way he wanted to be remembered, but he is remembered and maybe in the end that's all anyone can really hope for.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|I had high expectations of this film but overall it was dull.  Although different from most other films it left me empty.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna is the queen of pop and I think this album is very good and awesome but the only thing is I think personally is that Madonna is swinging into the hip-hop era mixed into her own pop music which we are not used to. We are used to the pop even some techno from madonna but this cd is very good do not get me wrong. My opinion on the tracks are everything is good except \\"incredible\\" and \\"voices\\" and they are my least favorite but everything else is awesome. She never fails to bring us a little something sweet with a beat and to feel the heat. For people who are thinking about getting this cd and reading these reviews please understand that this is no \\"CONFESSIONS\\"because I have read that this is confessions with a hip-hop twist and I do not hear any techno from Madonna on this album maybe a little on \\"dance 2night\\"but this is no \\"CONFESSIONS\\" this cd is still great though.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|By far the biggest find in all this is the Paris concert for that tour.  Prior to this, the only footage of the Joshua Tree tour is what you see in Rattle & Hum.    The concert is them riding high on that album and their newfound status as biggest band in the world.  For the first time ever you seen on DVD live versions of \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" and \\"Unforgettable Fire.\\"  Both sound great, as does most everything else.  The staging is simple and direct (before all the spectacle of Zoo TV and Popmart), and the sound is GREAT.    The remastered CD sounds pretty much the same; with a bit more kick, a bit more low-end and you can hear certain ringtones from Larry's snare that you couldn't before.    Also cool are the enclosed photos from the Joshua Tree cover shoot, which just beg to be framed and hung somewhere in the house.  The booklet contains the band's observations on this album and what inspired it.    Even if you own almost every U2 thing--and I do--this was yet a new revelation and not the usual repackaging-with-a-bonus-song that most reissues are.  Well worth it.
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|It's a sincere documentary of the era it depicts. Excellent in every respect thanks also to Criterion treatment.
B00005MP58|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing it on youtube. I fell in love instantly. I think this is the best version of Pride and Prejudice film, much much better than the movie version. It captured the book faithfully and the actors (especially Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle) played their roles so convincingly yet so subtly. The movie version is exaggerated too much and the main actors, well, I just don't think they are believable enough.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|One doesn't have to care about the philosophical underpinnings of this visually stunning film (made well before the advent of CGI technology) to be entertained by it, because not everyone looks for anything but entertainment in movies of whatever kind.  Ridley Scott's objective, however, is never simply to entertain, though he does so superbly well, at least in my opinion. His filmography bears me out.
B000YKE87W|5.0|This CD offers arias very familiar to the opera lover, but it is worthwhile because Jonas Kaufmann is a fresh, vibrant tenor voice, equally competent in opera as in the Lieder repertoire. Excellent quality, beautiful diction  and stylistic interpretation. It is  a fine selection of arias in French, Italian, and German from the 19th Century Repertoire.  I recommend it highly.
B000I2KS0C|3.0|Sorry, but this one proved to be not as enjoyable as the earlier release (which I had given to a friend as a gift).  True, the picture quality of the disc is outstanding -- the best I've ever seen on a DVD.  However, there are no extras of any kind on the disc.  No director's commentary -- which for me is a must on a DVD;  no trailers; no making of documentary.  Just the movie itself.  Sorry, but I expected better.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I really enjoy the new album by MADONNA--\\"HARD CANDY\\".  The songs are all fun and dancy with a lotta beat.  I think SHE just wanted us to have fun with this album, kinda like an escape from all the troubles in the world.  I can't listen to it enough and the more I listen, the more I enjoy it.  Thanks MADONNA for another great album.....
B00003CXSP|5.0|This is absolutely the best of the entire Hannibal Lecter film series thus far. Ridley Scott's dedication to making solid films and not movies really pushes Hannibal far to the forefront of anti-hero worship and in the most uncomfortable of ways that just get under every inch of your skin.<br /><br />So when did it become cool to really identify and bond with these villainous anti-hero's like Dr. Hannibal Lecter? Maybe it goes back further than I can place as I write this, but not in modern film and literature has there been such a mesmerizing and indelible character that most viewers just cant seem to get enough of.<br /><br />I can fully understand the brilliance of Jeff Lindsey, who knew that Thomas Harris wouldn't be able to satiate everyone's desires by writing fast enough and picked up the mantle with the [[ASIN:0307277887 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]] series. He successfully reproduces a creepy yet likable murderous psychopath in the vain of Dr. Lecter. If you haven't seen the Showtime presentation of [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter]], it's a must see.<br /><br />As for Sir Anthony, I'm sure that I speak the sentiment of most when I say that it would be good to see him reprise his role once more and it would be equally cool to see it directed by Ridley Scott.<br /><br />The extras on the disc are fantastic for those looking to purchase the 2 disc version. It's well worth the money. Ridley's commentary is fascinating -- he actually states that of all his films 'this one is my favourite'. I was pretty stunned by that as I'm a big fan of Blade Runner. He probably enjoyed making Hannibal, which would be the difference of the two, as most already know, regarding Blade Runner.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is full of great songs, when i first heard 4 minutes i thought if that is the first single then the rest must be of equal or less quality, But I was wrong, the album has 4 Great hits that is way much better than 4 minutes \\" even though 4 minutes is not bad at all\\".  my rating:  1- Candy shop     8/10  2- 4 minutes      8/10  3- give it to me  9/10  4- heart beat     10/10  5- miles away     9/10  6- she is not me  4/10  7- Incredible     6/10  8- Beat goes on   10/10  9- Dance 2night   8/10  10-spanish lesson 6/10  11-Devil Wouldn't Recognize You  10/10  12-Voices         8/10    this album shows the outcome of hard work and talent. even non madonna fans can easily love this album for the sake of great hits.
0385043805|5.0|Very well written. Excellent descriptions. I could not put it down before I finished reading it.
B000VNMMPM|3.0|It is about the noblest man in the world, who saves the life of a chain-smoking, drunk, brutal, compulsive lying angel & how they both find love.  Great cinematography, and a delight to watch.
B00026YO36|1.0|So I was catching up on what Greg Dulli's been up to, (his recent Twilight Singers effort \\"Powder Burns\\" is just great). Well Lanegan as many of you probably know appears quite a bit with Greg and in fact offers a nice contribution with his low gravelly voice providing a nice contrast to Dulli's vocals. As an old Screaming Trees loyalist, it was a natural jump to take a gander at Lanegan's solo projects.    I listened to Bubblegum plenty of times, and while the good contributions he makes to the work of others are present in Bubblegum, there are gaping holes as well, namely the songwriting. The lyrics are fine, the production is fine, but the music is boring, weak, and completely forgettable. Thankfully forgettable. I couldn't find a single track to move me. Unless you can't live without his voice, I'd recommend living without this album.
0743496736|5.0|I don't know what was stronger: The characters, the story itself, the subject matter(s) being discussed or a combination of all of these elements. It's hard to imagine anyone over the age of 15 NOT being able to identify with at least some, if not all, of the characters. This book is not only well told, but well researched. All of the characters were psychologically believable and the actions that they took served to strengthen the haunting ending.

B0013ISU0A|5.0|R.E.M. a mainstay in the alt rock world for over 25 years now do it again with a tremendous album that rocks and doesn't take any tracks off.  Reminding me of the glory days they laid back a couple of decades ago this album pays homage yet is extremely fresh as well.  A must listen for every alt rock fan out there and of course any real R.E.M. fan will have listened to it several times by now.  Can't wait for MSG and Jones Beach to see the fellas again!!!!!
0446577391|4.0|What a fun, fast-paced story! Oliver Stone and the Camel Club are back in their third adventure, which is essentially a continuation of The Collectors. In this installment Oliver's true identity is used to lure out an assassin who is killing former CIA assassins. As I said, the story moves fast, but maybe a might too fast. Many of the chapters are only two or three pages long. You just get into a scene and it's over. However, Baldacci delivers a great story you won't regret reading.
B00005J73X|3.0|Lots of the great songs we want to hear from Bon Jovi, but; when they take snippets from many different concerts and put them on one CD, you end up with too much \\"crowd play\\" for my liking.  It probably was ok for each concert, but when you put them all together I thought too many of the songs had the band playing to the crowd and didn't keep enough to the original feel of the songs.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|This movie was very different, a great musical, very dark and humorous, I think you'll love it!

1430300612|5.0|How often do you get to hear a neuroscientist describe her own stroke?   This is an amazing story on three levels; physical, emotional, and spiritual. Dr. Jill's description of her eight year recovery is both uplifting and powerful. But the spiritual aspect is alone worth the price of admission. (I won't spoil it for you.)    Dr. Bolte-Taylor is not a writer of prose. Her style is that of someone experienced in writing scientific papers; factual, concise and parsimonious. But the content! That is what makes this a great book in my opinion.    A quick read but a powerful story.    Danny
1401216676|5.0|Batman is my comic book. These are the characters I keep coming back to, the Killing Joke is a great stop along the way.<br /><br />The Joker is perfect in this book. He's laughing, joking, even doing a song and dance routine, and he's dead serious throughout everything.<br /><br />Pick this book up. And don't let your kids read it. It gets rough.<br /><br />At the end of the book is a sequence called \\"Innocent Guy\\" and it, too, is worth the price of admission. Alan Moore needs no praise from me, but he deserves every sale his books earn.
1401902197|5.0|I love Louise L. Hay and this book and cd it just great. It would make a great gift for someone who is going through some tough times in their life and they need a little life. The positive messages on the CD are wonderful to fall asleep to.
B000059T00|5.0|We have the original album, but it nice to have it on CD to preserve the old album. Steve Winwood and Eric Clapton! It just doesn't get much better than that! A timeless classic for any rockers collection.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Not being a big Robert Downey Jr. fan, I thought this movie would be bad.  On the contrary.  This is the role that Downey Jr. was born to play!  The movie is not only good it is one of the best action films to come out in years!  Everybody cast was perfect from Terrance Howard as Tony Stark's military friend, to Gwyneth Paltrow as a very sexy version of Pepper Potts (Stark's fawning and overprotective Administrative Assistant).<br /><br />Stark is a wild playboy genius who reminds me of the Mozart character in Amadeus.  After being almost killed by a mine explosion from one of his own company's weapons, Stark becomes a changed man who is more interested in saving the world than creating weapons.  Unfortunately his evil partner and mentor, Obadiah Stane has other ideas.<br /><br />The action is great and Iron Man's suit is very believable.  It is amazing to see Stark dressed by robot helpers and to see how the armor goes on.<br /><br />Warning - Make sure you stay past the end of the credits or you will miss an important few minutes of added story that will set up the movie continuation and also introduce a familiar face.
B000002IRL|4.0|I think that 1990, 1991 and 1992 was a greater years for metal music. many band edited fabulous albums for this years and HORRORSCOPE is one of them.  about the albun, a like to say that is my favorite OVERKILL album. The level of sound, lyrics and instrumental work make it an excellent musical session for metal lovers. Am not an Ellsworth`voice fanatic, but the grandeur of album make omit that.
B000UJCALI|5.0|There are few films that can deliver the same chills and feeling of eminent dread that `The Shining' manages to bestow upon the viewer each and every time it is watched.  Just about every frame is perfectly crafted to entice genuine feelings of misery, fear and anguish.  This is one of those rare films that can stop your heart dead cold while simultaneously causing it to beat louder and faster than it has every beaten before.  `The Shining' is, in all honesty, one of the most effective horror films every filmed.<br /><br />But, thankfully, it's also one of the smartest.<br /><br />Yes, `The Shining', helmed at the capable hands of Stanley Kubrick, proves to be far more than a slew of cheap thrills but in the end becomes a fascinating film, one with enough `hidden' messages and meanings to keep the audience guessing long after the film has wrapped.  I love films that move you to ponder the vision behind it, and Kubrick has always been known as the supreme visionary.  `The Shining' is no exception.  When you look at Kubrick's work you can see his ability to make something deeply disturbing and ultimately `important'.  Just look at `A Clockwork Orange', `Eyes Wide Shut' and the obvious `2001: A Space Odyssey' and you'll see that Kubrick is far from a `simple' director.  So then `The Shining' would no doubt be far from a `simple' horror film.  When you watch and dissect all of the clues and tricks Kubrick places throughout the film (there are whole websites dedicated to this film and that very purpose) then you will begin to see this film in a whole new light entirely.<br /><br />Couple Kubrick with the intensity that is Stephen King and you have the potential for greatness.<br /><br />What I think happened here, sadly, is that many `horror' fans were expecting to see King's novel transported onto the screen; nothing more, nothing less.  Kubrick is not that simple.  If you look at what he did with `A Clockwork Orange' (although he did stay `truer' to that work than this) you can see that Kubrick always makes his films his own.  The same is true with `The Shining', but to a greater extreme.  Stanley Kubrick gave us his interpretation of the novel.  I admire this, adore this even.  Kubrick was a fascinating director who took chances and risks and they almost always paid off.  This is a masterful example of those risks working wonders for the finished product.<br /><br />The film follows the Torrance family; Jack, Wendy and their son Danny.  Jack and his wife have been asked to care for the `OutLook Hotel' for the winter and they are more than looking forward to the task.  It doesn't take long though for this task to turn into a burden when strange things start taking place and Jack begins to descend into the darkness of insanity.<br /><br />I don't really want to say much more about the plot or the events that unfold.  This is a film you really must see to fully appreciate.  What helps elevate this film is Jack Nicholson's flawless performance as Jack Torrance.  I'm going to broach the same subject I jostled around when reviewing Tim Burton's `Batman'.  Jack Nicholson always plays a variation of himself; and I adore this about him.  He's one of our greatest actors ever even if his range is slightly jilted by his overpowering demeanor.  I am the one person in all humanity who disliked his turn as The Joker.  I just thought it was too much.  It was an example of Jack playing Jack poorly (in my opinion)...but Jack Torrance is the supreme example of Jack playing Jack masterfully.  All his eccentricities are here in fullest form and they add so much to the fear permeating the film.  Any other actor would have fallen flat in my opinion for no one else can play Jack like Jack.  `The Shining' may be a smart film, but without Jack it would lose a lot of its chill-factor.<br /><br />When you take a flawless director and take a flawless actor and give them free reign with a flawless script you have a flawless film; no way around it.<br /><br />The other actors in the film have their ups and downs.  Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.  They work off one another brilliantly, and Lloyd effectively carries one of the most spine-chilling scenes in the film (`redrum') and manages to stay with the viewer long after the credits have rolled.  Shelley Duvall is less effective (thus the Razzie nomination).  Her whiney annoyance is a little much to take at times, especially towards the films conclusion.  I won't give her too much flak though for she does prove to be frantically stimulating (especially in that bathroom scene) at times.  When every other facet of the film is perfect you tend to forgive effortlessly the minor faults.<br /><br />In the end I must say that `The Shining' is in a league all its own.  As far as horror films go, there really is no better place to look.  Unfairly snubbed by every awards body at the time, `The Shining' is seriously one of the finest films ever made.  Kubrick was a master of the lens, and this is a superlative example of that very fact.Danny Lloyd us very, very effective as Danny Torrance.  Next to Nicholson, Lloyd is perfectly cast.

B00097A5HW|5.0|This album is simply amazing. After the commercial success of her first U.S. release, LAUNDRY, Shakira went back to her artistic roots with this all-Spanish album. The musicality, lyricism, and tone of this CD puts all of her prior and later work to shame. Even the English VOL. 2, a great album in its own right, pales in comparison. Shortly after its release, \\"Hips Don't Lie\\" (which is not included on the original version of VOL. 2) became a big hit. I don't assume Shakira will ever return to this sort of artistic work, preferring to make millions making mindless pop songs, and who can blame her? At least she gave the world this one resounding triumph of sound.
6304696515|5.0|My adoration of period pieces should have brought me to this film a long time ago, truly, but sadly I had never even heard of this movie until 1999 when a certain `Cruel Intentions' blazed its way into my life (I still kick myself for forgetting to include that film in my top ten of `99).  After expressing my devotion to the beautifully twisted film my cousin asked me if I had seen the film that inspired it.  She then proceeded to tell me about this film called `Dangerous Liaisons' starring Glenn Close and Michelle Pfeiffer and suddenly I found myself experiencing heart palpitations beyond normal.  I just had to see this movie immediately.<br /><br />And I did; that very evening in fact.<br /><br />`Dangerous Liaisons', based on Choderlos de Laclos' 1782 novel `Les Liaisons Dangereuses', finds French aristocrats (and former lovers) Marquise Isabelle de Merteuill and Victomte Sebastien de Valmont weaving their schemes of betrayal and deceit all over 18th century France.  Isabelle and Sebastien fancy themselves with destruction of the people around them, hurting others for their own selfish pleasures and taking pride in their manipulations and conspiracies.  Issues arise though when Sebastien finds himself falling into love with his latest victim, the young and beautiful Madame Marie de Tourvel, and this spark of genuine emotion derails his tryst with Isabelle and threatens to destroy everything in the process.<br /><br />`Dangerous Liaisons' is superbly crafted.  Everything from the beautifully detailed set pieces to the stunning costumes and cinematography to the brilliant script and impeccable direction are all top-notch and carry this film to a whole other level.<br /><br />What really drives it over the edge though is the phenomenal acting on the parts of the three leads.  John Malkovich may not posses the same dashing good looks as Ryan Phillippe but he has undeniable charm and a firm grasp on his character.  The development of Sebastian in `Cruel Intentions' is a different direction than that taken for Sebastien in `Dangerous Liaisons' and so it's truly unfair to compare the two performances for ultimately they are different people all together.  Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning as usual here, but her control and innocence when fleshing out Marie is so mature and flawless that I'm almost tempted to say this is her finest performance to date (but Michelle is so good in everything it's hard to say that for sure).  Taking the majority of the praise and admiration though is Glenn Close who is ravishingly superior in this film.  Her performance is luminous, truly absorbing and commanding and delicious to watch.  She is the ultimate villain; cunning and witty; able to manipulate the audience into loving our loathing of her.  I'm soured by her Oscar loss; but at least she received the nomination.<br /><br />The supporting players hold their weight, especially Uma Thurman who is able to transcend the confines of her character and stand out as memorable indeed.  Swoosie Kurtz delivers strongly here as well.  Keanu Reeves is an actor I detest strongly.  I have never felt he delivered strongly, except maybe in the first `Matrix' film where his deadpan delivery aided in the formation of Neo.  Aside from that though, he continues to bore me with his lack of talent.  In `Dangerous Liaisons' he manages to entertain me slightly, delivering maybe his best performance (thankfully it's not a focal point of the film) and so I'll refrain from attacking him full on here.  He is far from a good actor, but he doesn't disgust me here (I may be blinded by my adoration of the balance of the film though).<br /><br />What I love most about `Dangerous Liaisons' is its ability to expose the dangers of love and betrayal, of wealth and greed and selfishness.  At its deepest point, `Dangerous Liaisons' is a film about the decline of morals and the destructive nature of our own carnal desires.<br /><br />In the end I have nothing but the utmost love for `Dangerous Liaisons'.  If you are a fan of the modern adaptation that is `Cruel Intentions' then prepare yourself for the ultimate treat and rent this masterpiece.  Steven Frears (who should have received the Direction nomination for this) brilliantly crafts a film that embraces its strengths and amplifies them marvelously.  It's a period piece; it's a drama; it's a thriller; it's a black comedy and it's a romance, and it succeeds effortlessly on every account.ptation that is `Cruel Intentions' then prepare yourself for the ultimate treat and rent this masterpiece.

There are so many things to look at, it's well-organized, and includes a little something to read on almost every page.  Some of the things in this book made me laugh, and other pages really made me think about the world I live in.  I guess that's the point.    If you want to get into stencil painting, this book will open your eyes and give you lots to think about.
B000002GC2|5.0|if i'm correct, 'the dude' followed quincy jones' 1977 'sounds'.  and the results are equally incredible!<br /><br />the presence of guest singers includes the great patti austin, james ingram and michael jackson.  the instrumentalists are equally formidable like the brothers johnson, stevie wonder and david 'hawk' wolinski.<br /><br />the greatest plus is that are more songs than 'sounds' 7 tracks.  and a couple of them became identifying songs of the early 1980s like 'one hundred ways', 'ai no corrida' and 'just once'.  there is very little to dislike about this album.  it is foremost in showing off the producer as star. and that is not always a bad thing, is it, mister timbaland?

B000R8YC18|5.0|When I first saw this film, I was literally shocked at the end. De Niro played a lonley, mentally disturb man extremely well. By the end of the film, we see the end result of Travis's mental prison. Travis worked as a taxi driver frequenting areas high in crimes, prostitution, sex, drug, and other oddities of our modern society. Throughout the film, we saw Travis transform from a lonely person who perhaps has communication issues to an obsession to end the life of a candidate. By the end of the film, Travis decides instead of killing a presidential candidate, he would save the life of a 12 years old girl imprisoned by her pimp to a life of prostitution. Armed with a 44 magnum and various other pistols, Travis went to the girl's pimp and ruthlessly, and violently, killed him and all those associated with the girl's imprisonment. At the end of the film, I was a bit confused. Travis is hailed as a hero by the news and everything was \\"back to normal\\" - Travis was back at his job as a taxi driver. The 12 years old girl apparently returned to her parents who thanked De Niro. I read over some theories about the ending and they are all plausible. As with all good endings to movies, it leaves the audience questioning what they saw rather than giving them a straight answer. I applaud the makers of the film for the ending that leaves you asking questions rather than finding answers.     Overall, Taxi Driver was a shockingly, scary movie about loneliness in a big city filled with crimes and other unpleasantness. After watching the film once, I couldn't get it out of my mind. At one point I sympathized with De Niro's character, then by the end, I was shocked at what he did.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I like many of my friends feared that when Madge was working with Pharrell, Timbaland that she would be caving into the hip hop sound. But too my suprise this cd is danceable, FUN, and has many really cool electronic beats.

0670018651|1.0|And why should I care what they think? Turin is a biophysicist and Sanchez is a web critic. In the book's \\"Acknowledgements\\" they thank other online review sites, which is where the authors' reviews belong. This book seems more a vehicle for their self-styled wit than anything resembling objective evaluations of popular scents. Some reviews go so off track with rambling prose that the reader can forget what they're reading. I suspect this book is a vehicle for turning their OPINIONS into cash! If you want to know about fragrances, go smell them. The authors can't convey the essence of scent anymore than you can describe a color. You can only smell for yourself.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Don't believe all the negative reviews written by people who \\"pretend\\" to be Madonna fans not liking this album. On several Mariah Carey message boards, fans decided to do this to make their \\"negative\\" reviews a little bit more legit. How pathetic that Mariah's supporters feel the need to do this to other artists.    In any case, this is an excellent album that is one of Madonna's best albums and it doesn't contain any filler songs. The standouts here are \\"Give it To Me\\" a super wild dance track, and \\"Miles Away\\" a thoughtful midtempo ballad about a torn relationship.    Fans who enjoyed Madonna's first album will definitely like this one. Fans who want Madonna to sing ballads - stay away.
0142004235|5.0|This was recommended to me by a friend because she thought I would enjoy the California scenery and history. This book totally exceeded my expectations. Steinbeck is an amazing story-teller. This novel is woven in such a complex, precise manner, with no excess details, that I marvel at his writing prowess. There is a reason it is a classic. I was bummed to come to the end of the book and I will definitely read more by this author. Why don't more modern writers write books of this quality? After reading this book, I feel like a lot of the more modern fiction I have read kind of sucks. In other words, this book is incredible and others should read it, especially people who intend to become professional fiction writers.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I'm torn on which way to go with this movie. The pace and energy are really good, with some selfish, self obsessed posers getting their comeuppance - always a winner in my book. The 'monster' is interesting, the effects impressive. BUT - the hand-held 'Blair Witch Project' angle was annoying to begin with, and it hasn't improved with age. And even though I'm on the other side of the pond, even I recognised a moment of pure, unforgivable tastelessness when the dust came rolling down the street, a la the 9/11 rip off. Not good. If they hadn't tried to be so 'clever', or cheapen 9/11, I'd have given it five stars. And there's a difference between 'homage' and re-hash.<br /><br />Yours,<br /><br />Baby Cromwell
044024238X|3.0|Sophie Kinsella is possibly the hottest author in Chick Litville - and rightfully so. Her Shopaholic series continually delights and attracts new readers with the lovable yet laughable main character Becky Bloomwood shopping her way around the world and causing many a mishap along the way. The Undomestic Goddess marks her second non-Shopaholic book, yet fans of Kinsella's general style (light on substance, heavy on style and hilarity) will enjoy this as a nice departure in between their Becky Bloomwood fixes.    The story is about a workaholic lawyer named Samantha who has a career meltdown, and in a daze, ends up in a small town where she accidentally gets hired as a housekeeper/chef for a wealthy couple. Along the way she meets a guy, makes friends, learns to enjoy herself, and has many a mishap in and out of the kitchen, and ultimately has to decide whether the simple life is really everything she wants.    I was initially skeptical about the premise providing enough to sustain an entire novel, and I was right. The plausibility of the story was laid on a bit thinly, moreso than in other Kinsella books, and really the focus of the story never felt like it was Samantha's turn as a domestic goddess, it always felt like it was studying the balance (or lack thereof) of the modern employee work/life balance.     I didn't necessarily agree with the turn Samantha made to combat her extremely stress-filled, work-focused life, nor did I completely agree with some of her arguments, and Kinsella makes her characters pitifully two-dimensional which made it hard to figure out what Samantha is - beyond helpless in the kitchen, and unsatisfied with her career. In fact the ending is rather ambiguous because Kinsella herself probably realized it didn't make sense to put a more definite spin on things.    Overall this is a very enjoyable quick read if you're looking for something to pass the time without much thought. If you aren't into Kinsella's writing style or her consistentlyfrenetic pace and lack of characterization, then skip it, but it really is a fun, frothy read.
B000002U82|5.0|Simply said, one of the greatest CD's by one of the greatest band's ever put together.
0307387151|4.0|First let me say, I truly loved the story of this book - which as you've probably recognized, was recently made into a film. Given that most readers at this point will be picking up Atonement because of the movie, I think it's fair to do a fair bit of comparison between the two. Both the book & the film play out in similar ways in that they both possess some shining, outstanding moments of brilliance and clarity, but for every four of those there was one moment that needed some polishing, hence my grade of 4/5 stars.    The story starts in the mid 1930's when a thirteen year old girl named Briony, known for being a bit fantastical and in her head, witnesses a series of events one day and misinterprets them to the entirely wrong, adolescent conclusion, and tells a lie that sets off a rapid chain of events that forever change the lives around her - most notably of her older sister Cecilia and her newfound love interest, their longtime childhood friend Robbie. The story follows the path of the lie and its far-reaching consequences through World War 2 up until the end of the 20th century.     Part of me wishes I hadn't seen the movie - given the very unique ending - but a bigger part of me is glad I had, as it made the book a lot easier to read than I suspect it would be for someone who hasn't seen the film. I was amazed at how good the film really was in its adaptation of the book, in terms of keeping in the majority of major dialogue sequences and accurately portraying the scenery as it is described in the book. Most importantly, it really did a great job of capturing what the book was about, the general feeling and sensations you got from the book were translated beautifully on screen.    The one main thing the book did better than the movie was the delivery of the story itself through Briony, especially her thought process as she witnesses the various events early on in the story. The prose itself is quite well written, although (like in the film) it tends to lag abit and get off track from the core themes during the section set in the fields of WW2. There are excellent themes surrounding redemption and coming of age and lots of complicated moral questions that made the book more enjoyable to read than I had anticipated.     My final note would be that the film did a much better job at revealing its final twist than the book - it was acted in such an outstanding way that you felt the weight of the final revelation that much more, although it was strongly based on the excellent writing of McEwan in these final pages. Recommended for fans of books such as The Kite Runner.
B0013ISU0A|4.0|La primera escucha del cd me ha gustado, mucho más que la de el anterior pero bastante menos que sus obras emblemáticas de hace años. Se echa de menos un bombazo que alegre el disco. Por otra parte, el dvd me ha parecido malo, aburrido y de una \\"modernor\\" inaguantable. Soporífero. Prescindible. Un rosco para el dvd. Saludos campestres.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I had never seen the musical Sweeney Todd but had heard it's different.    Then they announced they were releasing it as a movie directed by Tim Burton and the lead played by Johnny Depp.    I love Tim Burton movies, they are not your run-of-the-mill movies.  They have style and humor.    Then there is the pairing of Burton and Depp.  Burton said himself they fit well together and he is right.    I know Johnny Depp said he has never sang before (not even in the shower according to one of the extras in the DVD) but for not singing he did a VERY good job.  The low notes do lack alittle but more than makes up for it with the higher notes, such as in My Friends.    I think it was a very bold movie to cast people who are not known as singers or who are not singers to be in a musical, it makes it more gritty.    The pairing of the cast is wonderful and delightful to see Timothy Spall, Alan Rickman and Helena Bonham Carter together in a different movie (Harry Potter fans know all three well).    One word of warning, although the blood is theatrical red there is a lot of it so the squeamish may want to stay away.    Kudos for Burton for giving us another delightful movie.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Bon Iver is a stunning artist. The music is based on folk elements comprising of the most soothy of evening sky melodies that bands like My Morning Jacket try so hard to stress upon. I haven't heard any other album by the artist. I was delighted and the charm the music carries is much more than self-congratulating, it stresses further down the river.<br /><br />Re:Stacks - for instance, has the kind of tune which melts away any tiredness that comes from a day in the hack or behind your office rack bending over to get a paper you dropped<br /><br />Flume - This is definitely not a summer song but it's 40 degrees where I live and flume somehow helps. The song has the most irony induced of lyrics.<br /><br />YOU WILL NOT be able to judge the lyrics on the album. You have no option but to like the lyrics. I feel \\"For Emma, Forever Ago\\" is not an album that can be neccessarily be judged because it is what music is. It would be unfair to scrutinize something so poignant and off-shore. The vocalist seems least bothered about the fact that he's singing and this is apparent in every song. Every single sung is with precision and melody. I don't like Wolves too much, not sure what was happening there.<br /><br />Skinny Love brings a smile but is not the best song on the album.<br /><br />You know what, I'm just gonna stop talking about the songs. The album cover could have been perfect because the sound is just delirious and uplifting. Bon Iver knows when to pause and sing. When to sing and then pause. Effortless good music.<br /><br />So far this is my find of the year.<br />My friends think I'm song last king of Hotland for finding this particular artist.<br /><br />The music heals. These songs are here to stay.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry a children's SF for 8-12 year olds written in 1993 is part of a loose set trilogy set in the same imagined world but not necessarily with the same characters. It deals with a world where your life is one of conformity and happiness. The short novel honestly faces why a society such as this would arise with its benefits and essential failure explored. The core of that failure is that...grief is the price you pay for love. Without sadness, can love and laughter really exist?<br /><br />We discover a community of unlimited happiness and good manners set in a green and pleasant paradise of high but largely hidden technology. In this world, only 50 children per community are born from genetically approved placements in birth mothers. Regulations define your clothes, toys and your role in society from your first year. From eight you have to volunteer for a range of community duties so that your life long occupation from twelve can start. We join Jonas as the ceremony for 12's is near for the allotment of his calling.  Much to his and the communities shock he is not allotted a job but is selected to be the Receiver. In learning what this is, he discovers the hidden pain and dark side of unlimited happiness. This sets off a chain of events as Jonas discovers what being released really means. He faces what growing up means,  and consequences whose meaning you have to decide.<br /><br />The book has over 3000 ratings on Amazon.com alone so we are talking popular and critical success (it won the Newbury Medal- the USA children's literature award). Even so, it is banned in several USA State's School and Library systems because of the dark emotional issues dealt with. If you or your children have not read it then you have missed a classic. But if you have read it then you know why it's enjoyable and highly recommended!
B0011NVC9I|1.0|The only reason that I kept watching after the first 5 minutes was to find out how much worse it could possibly be.  I could not believe out of almost 200 reviews, it gets a 3 1/2 stars.  What are people thinking?  I am not against computer generated stuff but this is way too much to digest.  It looked all fake and waxy.  Nothing else.  It's one thing to build a physical set (such as a city wall as in Kingdom of Heaven) then do a bunch of CG around that.  It's totally another to do the whole thing in computers.  I felt so cheated.  This would be the last CG movie I ever watched.  It would be a much better movie with real actors and some real physical sets.  Even a real animation (such as Shrek) version of it would be way better than this.  Two hours wasted.  Avoid at all cost.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Fantastic, almost hynoptic music.  Perfectly complements the story of Christopher McCandless, but stands alone as well.
6303257844|2.0|After the first 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls with little or no dialog-- about the time the super-charged bus made a death-defyimg leap across a freeway chasm-- I figured there had to be a pause coming up. You know the old-fashioned type movie-making when the audience gets a chance to catch its breath and anticipate the action to come. Maybe even a few minutes of human interest. But that pause never came. Then after the second 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls-- about the time the bus blows up the airplane real good-- I figured the pause had to come. But no, it never did. Instead, there was another 30 minutes of non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, and about the time the subway began to get a mind of its own, something really strange happened. I realized I had gotten bored. Now you wouldn't think that with all that non-stop action and hair-raising close calls, a viewer could actually get bored. But I was. Something, I think, about too much of one thing becoming first familiar, then old, and finally tedious. Then when the non-stop action and hair-raising close calls finally did come to a stop, as all things must, I had my final revelation. What I had just sat through only looked like a real life movie. But it wasn't. Not really. Instead it was only a cartoon version of non-stop action and hair-raising close-calls with human versions of those familiar characters the Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote. Unfortunately, the money I spent was not cartoon money.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|One look at the tacky cover of this cd and we're transported back to the time of her \\"Sex\\" book, when Madonna loved to \\"shock us\\". Shocking people with her up-front sexuality was her primary talent. It certainly wasn't singing,although she could be quite good at times,with \\"Ray of Light\\" being her peak. Desperate to stay relevant she became in her career an expert on trend-hopping. So after the fizzy,dizzy Abba-sampled,disco-retread of \\"Confession on a Dance Floor\\"(and just how great were \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\"!)Madonna tries on another producer team, to keep up. If I were a devout Madonna fan(which I'm not)I'd actually be a little insulted by \\"Hard Candy\\". Totally phoned in,this cd sounds exactly what it is,a rushed affair to finish out her contract,and make a few bucks off of fans who would pay to hear her burp. But,the songs here will probably be greasing up dancefloors through the summer cause the djs need something to play and Madonna has certainly,if nothing else,become a brand. I think I'll go listen to \\"Frozen\\".

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Imagine that your whole life, your entire existence was the creation of another human being's mind. What would it feel like to know that your actions were not the result of individual thought but were born of an author's imagination? How would you react if you knew that all of your pains and problems were no more than the whims of an eccentric writer? What if your fate, your world, even your personality were just the invention of another person? And what if your life was about to end and you knew, but had no control other than to accept the circumstances? This is the reality of Harold Crick.    It's not an easy thing to do, telling a story within a story, but in the hands of talented director Marc Forster ([[ASIN:B00007L4KR Monster's Ball]] & [[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland]]) the end result is both profound and entertaining. Will Ferrell assumes the identity of Harold Crick, an obsessive compulsive and pathetically predictable IRS agent, whose world is turned upside down when he begins to hear a woman's voice narrating his daily activities. He discovers that his death is approaching and this knowledge brings new meaning into his neat and tidy life.    With a cleverly bizarre premise like this, you know that there will be a host of quirky but lovable characters and if this film had been directed by anyone else, these characters might have become two-dimensional and dull. But Stranger Than Fiction has a wonderful cast including Emma Thompson as Karen Eiffel, the narrator and writer who decides Harold's fate, Maggie Gyllenhaal as an anarchistic yet friendly baker, Dustin Hoffman as a literary expert who must help Harold decipher the purpose of his life and his story, and Queen Latifah who plays a no-nonsense author's assistant determined to help Karen Eiffel overcome her writer's block. Now this film could easily have become over-the-top and heavy handed but just avoids to do so. It maintains a tricky balance of comedy and tragedy, of intellect and emotion. And this can be attributed to its amazing cast and its confident director. It's not a perfect film (I've never seen one and I don't think they exist) but it is extremely enjoyable.

B000I2JDEY|5.0|I had not been able to find this movie for a long time,not only did I find it in Amazon.com but I recieved it extremly fast and in better condition that described,Amazon.com has always meet and far exced my expectations,Thank you!
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I`ve seen both the English and Japanese version. And I highly recommend that you watch the Japanese version. The English version is an insult to your ability to hear.    The graphics are what you may expect from the creators of FF.  The Story lacks a real plot, but nonetheless it should keep you entertained througout the movie.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This series has gone and blown away the mold of the police drama.  Soars FAR above everything else that is currently out there.  By the time Vic and the strike team are through, police shows will never be the same.  This series is a must for anyone who is starving for unpredictable, unprecedented action/drama/excitement.  It is never what it seems.  The Shield comes at the viewer from so many different directions that it keeps the viewer guessing to the end of each and every episode.  I can only give this series the HIGHEST possible recommendation!
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Rush always has a couple of great songs as a minimum on every album, even the weaker ones from late 80's and early 90's. This album, on the other hand is very very good all around, it might be their best one since Moving Pictures.  Watch them live if you have a chance. These guys are amazing musicians and put on a great 3hr show.
B000QXDED6|4.0|A great STORY (that's what too many people fail to remember) and a great movie.  There is no doubt license has been taken with this piece of history, but as a whole, the film is a fine work.  Bloody and beautiful, 300 delivers from start to finish.
B00009MGGI|4.0|Ian Richardson is perfectly cast in his role of deceit, manipulation, ego, and power.  There is a tradition of quality in British drama and mystery and this production certainly lives up to it.
B000LC3ID8|5.0|This film helps to make the story of Jigsaw even more complex.  A great addition to the franchise.  Nothing is ever simple in the Saw series and this installment is no exception.  Horror fans should be pleased.  These films seem to be very \\"fluid\\" in continuity, film style and feel.  Many other filmmakers could learn from that alone.  Highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|I was concerned that it would be \\"fluff\\", more of the same, etc. in the self help genre. However, I found it to be a wonderful tool for relection, growth in awareness and even in spirituality.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|The only way for their love to see the light is when he (Edward Norton) learns how to make them disappear. It's love coated with magic acquainted with lightly thrilling events.<br /><br />I like the way Eisenheim (Edward Norton) carries himself as a magician and as a lover. He says very little but his eyes and actions speak volumes!<br /><br />I love everything in this movie and I don't mind seeing it again.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Chalk me up as another longtime Madonna fan that isn't impressed with her latest offering.  Some of these songs sound truly cheap, the kind of stuff you hear after last call at the club, when everyone's tired and drunk.  I mean really, why is everyone so jazzed about tracks like The Beat Goes On?<br /><br />The opener, Candy Shop, isn't half bad, but unfortunately things mostly go downhill after that.  4 Minutes, well that's just Madonna having a MTV TRL moment. All over the place, there's examples where her production team dropped the ball.  Take Heartbeat, which starts off promisingly but goes nowhere.<br /><br />The only two tracks I really enjoy are Miles Away and Voices.  Miles Away is Madonna, not her busted-down ghetto sister M-Dolla.  I swear she sounds like Susan Ottavio from Book of Love, at the beginning of the song.  Voices, on the other hand, is a haunting, wistful dirge that is spoiled by distorted voice.  This one is crying out for a goth/synth makeover.  Why not ring that funereal bell more than once at the end?<br /><br />My God, to think that the last time she tried this, we got Bedtime Stories, my vote for her best album ever.  That set of producers and collaborators did justice to the Queen of Pop. With Hard Candy, I think this boxer, ahem, music star should be stripped of her title!!!
B000LC55F2|5.0|Two young ambitious magicians become absorbed in a game of challenge and revenge.    If it's your first time watching this movie, then try to focus as much as you can over every conversation and scene.     At first, many scenes will not make much of sense, but at the end they'll all pull together. The movie's scenario is one of the most complicated scenarios I've ever seen, and that what makes this film special and enjoyable.    If you like science thrilling movies then this movie is for you!
B000VWYNOG|4.0|I had heard all the radio selections such as \\"Domino\\" and \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" but I really didn't get into his music until he came out with \\"Wavelegnth\\" and later (my favorite) \\"Enlightenment\\". \\"Still on Top\\"  rehashes some of his greatest hits but most of these were done on an earlier \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. Again, a good CD to get a a sampling of what you are likely to hear on the radio from him but they leave out many of the songs you want to listen to over and over on his later releases.
B00005K3OT|5.0|In this movie chocolate is used as a symbol for sexual desires at a time when people rarely expressed their inner feelings openly.     Ironically Vianne (Julliette Binoche) opens her shop in a conservative French village at a time when everyone was celebrating Lent, a fasting time for Catholics. She challenged their desires and discipline while they challenged her ambition and patience.     I did not recognize Johnny Depp in this movie. After seeing him in this role I wish I could see him playing \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" or \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\"    Overall this is one of the movies I would like to watch over and over again!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I love this PS3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller because I can feel the action of the game especially in racing car and sport game. If you like to go back to originally controller this is the one. Highly recommended this product to everyone!
0446402389|5.0|In his first time at bat, Smith has hit a home run with Child 44. The plot is riveting, the prose is spot on, the narrative is engrossing, and the characters are fully developed. Smith weaves his tale in such a way that I, as the reader, felt I was right in the middle of all the action with the main characters. Basically, Child 44 is the story of Leo Demidov, a rising prominent officer in Stalin's Soviet Union State Security force during the 1950's. Demidov is a former war hero whose only ambition is to serve his country, to defend the worker's paradise, and to guarantee a secure life for his parents and for his wife. Ideological crimes -- crimes of disloyalty, crimes of thought and crimes against the revolution -- are forcefully suprressed without question. And then the impossible happens; in that a different kind of criminal -- a murderer -- is on the loose, killing at will. At the same time Leo finds himself demoted and denounced by his enemies. The only way for Leo to save himself and his family is to uncover this criminal. From this point on be ready to be unable to get up from your chair until you finish this exciting, extremely well-written story (which is based on fact). If you pay careful attention to the early details in Child 44, I think you will (as I did) be able to guess who the murderer is in advance of the ending. This, however, does not detract from the riveting reading experience that Smith has provided in his debut thriller. Child 44 is one of the best books I've read in a while and I highly recommend it to you. Enjoy!
B00169XU8I|4.0|I was worried when I heard that Modonna's latest album would be a collaboration with Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and Pharrell Williams.  Main reason is because these are not exactly the type of artists that I usually listen to.  I was afraid that Madonna would make a fool of herself by making this album with them but it actually turned out really good!  It is a very enjoyable dance album.    But I was quite disappointed with this Candy Box Special Edition.  Unlike Confessions on a Dance Floor's Special Edition which I thought was a great item to own if you are Madonna fan.  This Candy Box is just a cardboard box with two extra tracks which you can get easily on iTunes if you want.  Of course there's a bag of Starlite Mint candies but I'm really not interested in it.  Plus these candies are made in China (no offense..) and I know I'm not going to eat them.      The bag of candies takes more than 50% of the cardboard box space and the color booklet is 16 pages, but not as exciting as the one included in Confessions on a Dance Floor's Special edition.    I enjoy this new album very much but the Special Edition is just not that special.  Considering the price, it is not really worth it..
B000OZ2CXE|5.0|This soundtrack is great. The songs were perfect in the film and it's like watching it when listening. I have both the cd and vinyl of this soundtrack and love them both (though I love the vinyl a little bit more). The vinyl has a great sound and has red \\"splatter\\" vinyl mixed with the black making me want to display it rather than listen to it. Hearing those songs on vinyl is far better than on cd, so if you've got something to play it on, I highly recommend getting the album. If you don't, get the cd. You won't regret it!
B000058A1G|4.0|Superb seventeen track collection of this mid-to-late '60's mod rocker's repertoire. Surprisingly enough, we get an almost completely different track listing than the one on 'Rolled Gold' (see my review) but do keep in mind that 'Rolled Gold' is a compilation of never-released demos. Didn't they put out like only five 7\\" singles? What's up with that? Must've apparently had a lot of unreleased material in the vault, no doubt. Tunes I was most impressed with were their cover of the Motown classic \\"Land of A 1000 Dances\\", \\"I Love You (Yeah)\\", the catchy \\"Hey Sha-Lo-Ney\\", \\"Baby You've Got It\\", \\"Come On Come With Me\\" and \\"Something Has Hit Me\\". Another case of some of the BEST music you've likely never heard before. Recommended.
B000003C4K|5.0|Well, I wasn't born an English Major. And in younger days, I got bitten by the heavy metal bug really bad. I know I'm in the minority, but I did consider \\"Exodus\\" superior to \\"Metallica,\\" \\"Megadeth,\\" and \\"Slayer.\\"<br /><br />I consider \\"Bonded By Blood\\" to be a strong, powerful, and consisten record. 'Bonded By Blood' is a powerful opener. 'Exodus' cleverly inserts the name of the group. 'And Then There Were None' keeps the pace of the record up. 'Lesson In Violence' is an especially powerful track. 'Metal Command' and 'Piranah' more than keep the record's strength at maximum levels. 'No Love' is alright. The lyrics on 'Deliver Us To Evil' were a tad overdone. 'Strike Of the Beast' ends the record on a high note.<br /><br />Overall, this is a powerful record that defines the hair metal style. It also has strong consistency. Metallica, Megadeth, and Slayer may be the more popular groups, but if you ask me, EXODUS is much better.
B0000524E5|5.0|I love this movie, but then I'm a sucker for anything with a happy ending. And I love getting a bargin, and this CD was wonderful. It arrived very fast and was in prestine condition for being used.
B00004Y6O9|4.0|I'm not the biggest Van Halen fan. But there is no denying that this is an excellent record. With all the records they made, somehow I doubt that I am alone when I say this 1st record of theirs is the best.<br /><br />'Runnin With the Devil' is a great and energetic opener. 'Eruption' is a nice instrumental. The cover 'You Really Got Me Now' has a great sound. 'Aint Talkin About Love' is one of the best songs on the record. 'I'm the One' is a bit weaker, but still good. 'Jamies Cryin' is softer, but still good. 'Atomic Punk' is strange, but interesting and energetic. 'Feel Your Love' kind of goes against my nature, but it keeps the pace of the record up. 'Little Dreamer' is a good moderate blast song. 'Ice Cream Man' has a huge following, but I will decline comment. 'On Fire' is a great conclusion to this great record.<br /><br />Thank goodness Eddie Van Halen and Diamond Dave are FINALLY back together!
B0002ZMJ5M|5.0|Ian Anderson and his crew are in fine form on this 2005 album, which includes many of his long-time band mates and a couple of younger musicians. Tull takes a brave approach with almost all new music, although many classic Xmas themes can be heard throughout.    While lacking the hard edge of many Jethro Tull classics, it is worth savoring and sharing with friends during any time of the year. Likely to remain on both holiday and Tull playlists for many decades to come.
B00002687X|4.0|I'm not the biggest \\"Europe\\" fan. But there is no denying that this is a really great record. While not as hard as \\"Bon Jovi's\\" '7800,' it is a bit harder than 'Crush.' (Kind of upper middle rock.) For the record, I know a nun who really likes this record.<br /><br />'StormWind' is a great powerful opener. 'Scream of Anger' is a good followup; 'Open Your Heart' has a nice gentle sound. 'Treated Bad Again' has an almost thrash metal sound. 'Aphasia' is a good instrumental. The title track is arguably the greatest on the record. 'Wasted Time' isn't my favorite, but it is alright. I didn't much care for 'Lyin Eyes.' but 'Dreamer' is a nice gentle song with some beautiful keyboards. 'Dance the Night Away' is a great energetic song that ends the record on a high note.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good record with strong vocals, good music, and an interesting variation of songs.
B000065PUE|5.0|I think that Doolittle is an important album in the music universe. It's a great work that people can't know.
0143113100|5.0|This is an excellent book that gives you hope, not only through real experiences but through the new brain research developments.  It is easy to understand and read.  At first I thought it was just going to be about case studies but the author gives you research based information in laymen's terms so it's easy to follow and understand.  It gives you hope that today brain injury is not the end of the world.  Love this book.
B000002UTK|3.0|The third \\"album\\" from the Pet Shop Boys was something of a stop-gap release. Two of the songs had already been released as singles (a single mix of \\"Always on my Mind\\" came packed as a seven-inch with copies of [[ASIN:B000002UD7 Actually]] and \\"I Want a Dog\\" was a b-side), adding a cover song \\"It's Alright,\\" and a rejected demo that became \\"I'm Not Scared.\\"<br /><br />Peculiarly, some of the songs here (of the short list of six) are among PSB's most ambitious. That madcap opener, \\"Left To My Own Devices,\\" is a six-minute tour-de-force of both the boys and Trevor Horn. Kind of an extension of \\"It's a Sin,\\" \\"Left to My Own Devices\\" has the classic claim of wanting to match \\"Che Guevara and Debussy to a disco beat.\\" Then the album heads to Miami, where Tennant and Lowe handed the song \\"Domino Dancing\\" over to Lewis A. Martin&eacute;e, the Miami-based producer behind 1980s who was hot with the \\"Miami Sound\\" of the moment. (His biggest hits came from girl-group [[ASIN:B000002VOS Expose]].) This cowbell heavy dance number became PSB's last major US hit.<br /><br />The expanded \\"Always on My Mind\\" wedged a house break in the middle to no great shakes, which seems done only to get a decent 12'inch mix out of the deal (and flesh out the album's running time). In fact, there was a collectors edition of \\"Introspective\\" that was all six songs released in a six-12 inch package (wish I still had that!!!) which pretty much emphasizes what PSB was aiming for. While \\"Introspective\\" doesn't hold together the way their best albums ([[ASIN:B000024QML Very]], \\"Actually\\" - hence the three star rating) do, as a collection of driving dance tunes, it's hard to beat.
0756404746|5.0|This book was an excellent beginning to what is shaping up to be a true epic.  I haven't been this engrossed in a piece of fiction in a long time and look forward to many more hours spent with this author.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|Rats! That is what the folks at Pixar threw at us for the delightful \\"Ratatouille,\\" the anti-Willard of kids movies. Filmed in a sweeping style (the visions of Paris after dark are almost dreamlike in their beauty), the story of Remy, the Rat who would be Chef, is the kind of Disney \\"can-do\\" movie that they've been making for years. But this is easily the best they've done since the original [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story.]]<br /><br />Remy has to overcome his upbringing and his species after he gets separated from his clan. A series of events leads him to Linguini, kitchen help at a famous but downtrodden French Restaurant. From there, Remy and Linguini form an alliance and taste success. But they still have a big obstacle to overcome, food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole, \\"Ratatouille's\\" only celebrity voice-casting). How they manage to warm his heart and save the day is fun and funny, only leaning into mean-spiritedness once or twice. (Unnecessary French bashing, Remy's Dad seems too simple a character).<br /><br />The animation is way beyond average. Remy is fluid and lifelike...conveying more with a shrug or shimmy than most live critters (including two legged ones). His ride down the stream is breathtaking, as are the visions of Paris. (For Purists: there's a disclaimer at the end of the movie that 100% Animation - not motion capture, etc - was used to create \\"Ratatouille.\\") The story of being who you are despite what others expect is positive, even coming from a hoard of Rats. What they have in \\"Ratatouille\\" that gets a bit different is that there isn't any stunt casting, the cast doesn't suddenly break into song, and the language doesn't revert into cliche of the day. It just starts a good story and follows it though to a happy ending. One you can watch with anyone, any age, and likely, for repeat servings.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Omnivore's Dilemma is a wonderfully written book which covers all aspects of food in today's world.  Michael Pollan starts by taking a close look at industrial agriculture from the view point of Corn.  A plant that is tailor made to our mass production, fossil fuel dependent agricultural ways. Corn farmers benefit from government subsidies that guarantee the farmer a minimum price per bushel.  This has led to an overproduction of corn which has further led to corn based products inundating nearly every food shelf in today's supermarkets.  Our farm animals are also raised on diets consisting largely of corn.  Yet industrial corn farming, as the author explains, causes much harm.  The rich fertile soil  in the Midwest is eroding at a rapid pace.  The fast growth of corn requires copious quantities of fertilizer in addition to insecticide.  Chemical fertilizers seep into the streams and rivers and have caused an immense zone deplete of Oxygen in the Gulf of Mexico.  Industrial farming methods have also increased our dependence on fossil fuels.  By some estimates, one calorie of corn requires on average ten calories of fossil fuel before it reaches the consumer.       Michael Pollan discusses how we raise meat in this country.  Take the millions of steaks served all across the country every day. The cattle slaughtered were mostly raised on a CAFO(Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation) on a diet that evolution ill suited them to eat. A diet consisting largely of Corn. The Angus cattle spend most of their lives on lots devoid of grass or vegetation and full of eye irritating dust. They spend their lives ankle deep in their excrement and require antibiotics and anti parasitic drugs to survive until slaughter. They suffer from acidosis of the rumen, an organ evolved to break down the cellulose in grass. The E-Coli that sicken so many Americans every year are of a strain that adapted to survive in the now more acid rumen and which now can survive our acidic stomachs to make us sick.        Michael Pollan contrasts this form of agriculture to a farm in Virginia that raises chickens(broilers and eggs), and Cattle on only grass. The cattle feed on luscious grass kept that way by rotating the cattle from one area of the pasture to another to avoid overgrazing. The chickens feed on the grass and insects attracted to the farm life. The grass benefits by the natural fertilizer these animals provide. The farm is as productive per acre as an Industrial farm yet there are no hidden costs. No animal suffering, fertilizer runoffs, government subsidies, and the carbon footprint is far less.      Although the author does not devote a chapter on health and food, the health implications of how we grow our food is a common theme throughout the book. The organic food industry is talked about in length.  The origins of the term 'Organic' as well as how that term has now been co-opted by large industrial food producers thanks in large part to the federal department of agriculture.  The book slips into the esoteric realm of philosophy of food on more than one occasion, but the forays are usually brief and welcome.      How to grow food for 300 million people is immensely challenging. Especially since we're all so used to such a varied diet year round (strawberries in January).  Yet there are costs to the way we grow our food that are not paid at the supermarket register.  These hidden costs are in the form of environmental damage, governmental subsidies sought by a very powerful farm lobby, and even national security costs in having a food supply so dependent on fossil fuels supplied by foreign countries.  Eating local, the author strongly suggests, could be a viable alternative.  Expenditure on energy for transportation would be significantly cut, and a firsthand knowledge of where and how the food you consume would be gained.  This might seem like a small benefit but the author argues that this could potentially be positivelytranformative in the quality of the food we eat.       Although this isn't a diet book, you can't help but change your eating habits after reading this book.  I learned a great deal. I highly recommend it.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|This album is great in every way. It sounds current, yet familiar as Portishead. Simultaneously they don't rely on repeating what they've done in the past, instead exploring new audio boundaries for great effect. For all the detractors, just don't buy the album, keep listening to the same tired albums you have been for 10-15 years. For all the intelligent music fans, heres a true gem to discover.
0452289963|5.0|Imagine a book different from all others. Imagine recognizing sentences. Imagine the voice inside your head relating to passages written in these pages. Imagine a simple explanation that everyone can really understand. Imagine a book that can, if you are open to it, change the way you live your life. Read this book and experience the real thing. It can put purpose in you.
0446401307|4.0|The plotline was very good, but the shortness of the book left me wanting more of the old Harry Bosch.  I missed the melancholy time in front of the stereo at home pondering the case, his life, the problems with his wife/girlfriend, etc.  This book was a quick slam, bam, thank you reader.  I miss the interaction with his partner - he has a new one this time, but nothing there is developed; it's an after thought.<br /><br />The FBI and LAPD were again at each other and the mystery was worth the read, but I can't help but think that something is up with Connelly.  I felt like a good story could have been even better.  I just missed the the complexities of the previous stories - before \\"Echo Canyon\\".  And with the plotline that he had going, this could have been a superb book.
B000A2W1X2|5.0|I highly recommend this film for men and women.  My husband and I both enjoyed it, though it is not for family, adults only.  It is a wonderful drama of desire and passion placed in aristocratic England, 1800's.
B00006WKY9|5.0|What an amazing recording! This disc took me the longest to find of all of the Scorpions discs, which is amazing, since I believe it is their best studio album. I could argue about how good Lovedrive is, but that was Michael Schenker. Everything aside, Uli Jon Roth hit full stride on this album and then walked away from Scorpions to front his own band Electric Sun, which had at least 3 releases that I know of. Honestly, this disc has stupendous songs and music wizardry. Roth makes his strat talk and at this point had to of been one of the best guiatrists in the world. Rock solid songs on this release include Steamrock Fever, the Sails of Charon and He's a Woman - She's a Man. Those 3 songs rock and I've heard guitarists try to mimic and fail almost everytime. Other than the hard side there are also ballads and slower songs like Born to Touch Your Feelings and We'll Burn the Sky. On a scale of 1-10 I would give this disc a solid 10. My least favorite song is Suspender Love, but it is a good song in its own way. Whether you like it hard, slow or multifaceted [the Riot of Your Time], Taken By Force will take you there. Klaus Meine, Herman Rarebell and the rest of Scorpions, particularly Uli Jon Roth, lead an assualt on your senses and will leave you stunned. If you're my age you will probably wonder why more stations didn't play this in the day and I would wager if you heard it and knew who it was YOU BOUGHT IT!!! That is, unless you couldn't find it. Don't waste $10 on just anything, get something you will cherish the rest of your life. I like it, I like it a lot!!!
0061245097|4.0|After the way the first book ended, I was a little wary on the direction this series was going to take.  But this book met my every expecation and then some.  The story opens 4 years after the first book ended.  Cat now leads a team that hunts vampires.  She has a great life, friends, and is good at what she does.  But even now she still misses Bones, the love of her life.  I don't want to give too much away, so let me just say that this a fun, fast read that will not disappoint.  I think one of the best qualities of this book is the humorous dialogue and situations.  I was laughing out loud at some points, something I never do while reading a book.  Oh, and I'm not all about needing sex included in the books I read, but boy can Frost write a good love scene!  If all writers could write them that well I would be reading a lot more romance novels.  I hope Frost continues this series and if so, I can't wait to see the direction the next book takes!

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I'm a lit-head and I often cringe at how classic literature is portrayed on screen. This rendition of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is excellent and despite a few soap-opera moments of expressed passion, the characters are faithfully presented. I highly recommend seeing this version of the book. But, of course, nothing quite beats the novel.
B000053VAF|4.0|Item arrived quickly and as described. Some damage to the corners of the box but this more than likely happened in transit. Happy with purchase and seller. Reccomended.
1591841992|5.0|An excellent book.  Sometimes the best means of conveying ideas is via a written narrative and other times it is oral.  This book does an excellent job of not only providing very good counsel as to how to present ideas with illustrations but also to develop solutions to complex problems.  I expected a simple book but discovered one with much more helpful, substantive, practical guidance.  In fact, I've added this as one of the 12 business books our company book club discusses this year.

Tony Stark a mulity billionaire war-monger-who see's the light or error of his ways when he is taken hostage by power crazed nomadic rebels.He is nearly killed by one of his own bombs-his life is saved by a local doctor of sorts...with the aid of a battery operated device and geltin substance too contain the shrapnel.By now he is beging too see just what his weapons are being used for& who there really being sold too.Instead of building an ultimate bomb for his captors he builds his first suit of armor.Though quite bulky and rough it aids  him quite well in his escape& rescue.Upon return  he annouces the new path for Stark Industries.Which as too be suspected doesn't make the board happy.For the most part he ignors whats going on around him too construct a new suit of armor-to use against the weapons he built.Meanwhile it is revealed that his kidnappers were suppose too kill him instead,and the baord is trying too buy him or atleast lock him out.too make matters worse the rebels find the remains of the first suit-and begin  too restore it.Meanwhile, someone close to Tony  is pulling everyones strings.Will Stark survive his maiden outing as IronMan?Will he beable too stop his own weapons?Will he be able too stop the new upgraded prototype and its puppetmaster?Find out go see IronMan.  Notes-movie worth 2nd &3rds-Downey is perfect for the part-trial and error sequence  adds a good amount of additional comic releif.Great FX.  Down side -well some parts get a little wordy but thats okay ,the climatic fight well average for this type of movie,the real let down is Starks final sentce.Kinda makes a sequal tricky.
078322947X|4.0|I had not seen Sorcerer since its original theatre release three decades ago. Actually, I had been searcher for the DVD for several years. I am a classic movie fan, and one of my favourites is the legendary 1950s French movie The Wages of Fear, of which Sorcerer is a remake. It doesn't quite come off, and is not nearly as good as the original French movie. Yet it grows on you. The first week it arrived I played it three times! I think it is somewhat mistitled, and that might be partly to blame for why it was such a box office flop. Roy Scheider is topnotch in the movie, and so is Bruno Comer. Indeed, all the actors give a credible performance. The last scene is haunting. Yes, I would recommend this movie - but play it three times before you make a judgement!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a comedy. I would agree that this film is comical, but it is comical for the wrong reasons.     The main reason that it is funny is because it is so uneventful.  When I asked my mom about how she liked the movie she said, \\"It was so boring that I don't even remember what happened. All I remember is a weird boy with strange hair.\\"  Also, while watching the movie with 3 other friends, two of them fell asleep.    This movie is not worth buying let alone watching it. I do not recommend it for any moviegoers.
B000XTCBWS|2.0|But the truth is that it's inferior in every way but the audio to the '53 Krauss. While Keilberth manages some thrilling moments, even making some familiar passages sound fresh, these are far outnumbered by the times the orchestra lacks direction, the miracle sound quality only heightening the disappointment when the notes come unstrung from one another and turn the music into noise. One can hardly blame the singers, mostly the same ones for Krauss, when they lose their way in this haze of mediocre conducting.     The Krauss Ring, by contrast, sounds fearless, vigorous and nimble, Wagner written in lightning. Its praises are sung by a previous reviewer here, although I disagree strongly that the Keilberth's sound quality closes the gap.    The fans who've decided that this is now the \\"Reference Ring\\" are guided by considerations that have nothing to do with the music: Because of its discographical value as an unearthed treasure and now the \\"true\\" first stereo Ring, because the audio is utterly fantastic and even awe-inspiring for 1955, and - more importantly than the first two - because the price tag is extortionate, this MUST be the greatest Ring there is.    More generally, few are comfortable with speaking ill of something so completely and unanimously celebrated by all the critics. What the Joyce Hatto scandal revealed about many fans of classical music is that they're not only obsessed with dragging extramusical considerations into the debate of whether a recording is viable, but they'd rather read blow-hard professional reviews all day before ever trusting their own ears.    Bear in mind, it was this recording that filled Culshaw with a (misguided) conviction that a live Ring recording could never reproduce the experience the way a studio one could. The booklet included discusses the tangled web of reasons why this recording took fifty years to see the light of day, but I really believe that if Decca had been at all impressed by it, it would have appeared longago.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|As an avid fan of R.E.M. for twenty years, I have been throughly disappointed with there last two albums. This album has won me back though. It is a trip back to their roots. It is short and sweet. \\"Hollow Man\\", \\"Houston\\" and \\"Until the Day is Done\\" are all highlights, but it is a complete album.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I grew up with Madonna in the 80's, but during the mid-90's, I lost touch with her. A lot of her earlier hits played on adult listening stations, so I always remained somewhat current and interested. It wasn't until Ray of Light that Madonna truly engaged me and caught my attention. I was about twenty-four.  Her brilliant album 'American Life' truly is genius. I absolutely love when Madonna sings about life experience and social constraints, etc. With that said, her true pop sensibilities blow everyone around out of the water. I never thought she would top 'Confessions' (I attended 3 concerts), but 'Hard Candy'is becoming absolutely addictive. The synth sound, the 80's reverberations,the catcy lyrics all culminate to lift you out of the chair and dance all around. I, too, was worried and skeptical when I heard that hip-hop would influence this album. I actually now have some interest to listen to Kanye West. This album is absolutely fantastic. There are sounds, lyrics, and sensibilities that everyone can own. This is a culmination of 25 years of brilliant song writing, singing, and sounds from one of my generations icons. Madonna never disappoints and always delivers brilliance.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Keep in mind, that when it comes to drama, there's bizarre and then there's bizarre.  This one is the latter of those.  Johnny Depp fans will be thrilled at once with this character portrayal and even moreso when they hear his voice with a melodic charm with the various songs he sings.  Yes, he sings!  The other characters throughout this interestingly different tale, deserve no less credit for their outstanding portrayals of their respective personalities as well.  Not your ordinary musical with the stagefull of singers and dancers, but articularly adept with a modern day aire.  If you are not sure you will like it, but watch it anyhow, you'll likely watch it again and again, each time noticing little parts you missed the first time.
B000K15VSA|3.0|I ordered this with great anticipation.    Put in Disc 1, and it would not play.    I have a standalone SONY DVD Recorder/Player.    If your DVD player is the least bit finicky about what discs it plays, or if copy protection on a DVD prevents it from playing, then DO NOT BUY THIS.    Disc 1 played fine in my Computer's DVD drive, and it played ok in an older DVD player I have.    Once again, Digital Rights Management screws things up for the consumer, when all the consumer wants is to be able to buy a product that ACTUALLY WORKS!!!    I give this package 2 thumbs up for the content overall, but Warner Bros. are guilty of selling an item that doesn't work as advertised.    >:-(
B0015AARJI|5.0|The rumble support its finally here with the DS3 controller, if only Infinity Ward could add the rumble feature to COD4, this product would be a Perrrrfect 10.
B00005JPNY|2.0|Save your money and by the books. This is one of the most fascinating and captivating stories I have ever read. The movie just disapoints and completely leaves out the meat of the story. The movie you create in your head will be worth it. The movie had such potential, adding things that never happened in the book and leaving out key pieces just left me feeling like I wasted $20.
B000YKE87W|4.0|I've taken a different - or at least partially opposing point of view regarding this album than a number of my friends.  Initially, I, must admit I was slightly disappointed, expecting something more . . . but it is fast (very fast) growing on me.  I have to laugh at some public forum comments on this artist as being \\"Male Netrebko.\\"      Most early major label recordings of any artist always feature them in too familiar works pitting them against the memories (real or imagined) of one's favorite singers and the incomparable manner in which they sang such chestnuts.      However, the fact remains that Kaufmann is actually singing some of these roles and I think, ultimately for both voice and career, he is being absolutely wise in his choice of repertoire and keeping the voice flexible, fresh and free.  What a Tannhauser he will make with that sound.  Ditto Parsifal, Lohengrin and . . . well, I'm jumping ahead of myself.      The primary reason I think this album is growing on me, however, is that I absolutely LOVE the rather considerable contrast he brings to roles when compared to more \\"typical\\" Rodolfos, Fausts, des Grieuxs, Marios and Alfredos.  We're living in a magical time for light/lyric tenors but, even despite their distinct sounds and interpretations, they prove to have more uniform timbres presenting less wholly original dramatic spectrum in these roles.  I love the individual stamp that any singer can bring to these roles and for that reason am thrilled that as fine and intelligent singer as Herr Kaufmann is he seems to invest something unusual into each of his assignments.  For this alone, he rises to the top of the current \\"youngish\\" brood.      (For something truly wonderful check out the youtubes of Kaufmann in some of his operetta selections.  Wunderbar!)    To these ears, his French and Italian sound fine, if a bit more idiosyncratic than idiomatic.  Unlike other reviewers, however, I don't think this is due so much to his accenting these languagesin a native German voice, but rather resulting from his naturally darkish hue as well as the substantial weightiness of his voice.  In these Italian and lighter French selections, I have come to adore the sound of this voice - as well as the odd mixture of ease and intensity that seems to come through everything he interprets.        Kaufmann's Rodolfo sounds a bit meatier than we've grown accustomed to - and remains the least successful aria on the  album.  Still, I'm glad to have it as it's aurally intriguing and the likelihood of a studio Boheme with Kaufmann is less than nil, future generations wondering what he might have sounded like get to hear, and (most likely) grateful he ultimately took his considerable gifts into another direction.  Still, I can never get enough of good singers trying their voices out in fachs not distinctly their own, even for the sheer \\"curiosity shop\\" factor of it all.  Kaufmann is no less \\"curious\\" to me.      Soon enough will he be excelling as Parsifal, Lohengrin, and other heroic   German roles.  I'd love to see/hear him as Max in Freischutz, and some other of the Webber arias that just don't get aired enough.  Having Kaufmann in them could probably guarantee some interesting less frequently repertoire choices would sell some seats.  I loved his turn in the new Fierrabras - though the production itself often drove me crazy.  What the hell, I  also want to hear this guy as Peter Grimes - - even if it comes  off as (as Sills used to imitate Koussivetsky) \\"Paeter und Greimez.\\"      I am looking forward to very many more Kaufmann releases!
B000ICL3KG|4.0|Just like the book, very intersting  could open your eyes to whats happening to our world  disturbing.  Dont watch it if you wanna continue living in your little bubble of lies  save our world- GO GREEN!!
B0013FBS20|4.0|This is the 3rd installment in this series. Personally, I liked the 2nd adaptation of this series, \\"The Omega Man\\", probably the best out of the three, but I'm old school. This movie is definitely good on its own merits. I wish the infected were more human like instead of super human that can knock a giant SUV off the pier just from a running start and still get up only for another slam into the giant SUV. Man vs. SUV!!! A little over the top on that one!!! Otherwise, I thought this movie was very entertaining and a good look at what it may be like if our world ever undergoes a chemical attack, be it pharmaceutical, bomb, or otherwise.    One world, one race, The Human Race!!!!
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|Boring, slow moving with no screen chemistry, poor acting, and miserable meaningless \\"music\\". The storyline was poor and unimaginative.  Are so we so used to mediocrity in this culture, we actually believe drivel like this has value? I am afraid so.
B000WT7R6O|5.0|A great show.  The two brothers have superb witty dialogue; the action is exciting and the story-lines keep you wanting more.  These are cool guys doing cool stuff.
B000Y35A94|4.0|The release date in the UK is the 26th, so the 27th should be good here.  For those who can wait, there is supposidly a Blu-Ray version due out sometime after the regular DVD release.  If the US version is the same as the UK, it will be 3 discs, 2 of concert and bonus footage, and the 3rd will be a documentary on the last tour.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|Great Dancing!  Channing Tatum hot as ever, who would have thought he can dance?  Cute little dance movie.  Quite entertaining
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is such a great movie on a very complex subject. Schizophrenia is very misunderstood. To watch this man battle his demons, so to speak, as an every day occurrence was fascinating to watch. Although I had seen this movie years ago, watching it again brought back some things that I had forgotten about. Now, I have the opportunity for many more friends to see the movie and give their opinions. I actually have an Abnormal Psychology student that I let watch it so that she could see some of the symptoms of schizophrenia. She said that it actually did help her understand some of the concepts. Regardless of what type of character John Nash may or may not have been, the movie with Russell Crowe is excellent.
B000060OFT|5.0|This is one of Leo's best.  The combination of 1st: Baz Luhrmann(director), who is more cool than words; 2nd: Shakespeare, need I say more; 3rd: The Cast: De Caprio; Danes, Leguizamo, Perrineau, Postlewaite, Curtis-Hall, on & on.  The language of the times is used in an updated setting.  Except not really.  It takes place in no place in time.  Because there is no such duplicate place on this planet; regardless of language.  If you love Shakespeare, you will appreciate his universal themes and timeless appeal.  A big \\"Thumbs-up\\".
0517118297|5.0|I purchased this book as a gift for my granddaughter, only to discover a whole section of pages missing. When I contacted Amazon, I had a reply, literally within minutes, and a replacement copy was shipped FED EX the same day.  This kind of personal service is rare anywhere these days, and amazing to me for a company the size of Amazon! You are definitley the web site of choice for me! And oh yes, my granddaughter loved the book!
B00006L7MV|5.0|This is one of those DVD's that you put in your DVD player, crank the sound, then sit down and close your eyes. It will take you somewhere else. Chills will run down your spine, and you'll wonder how you ever listened to music in stereo. The stand out tracks are Krwlng, 1Stp Klosr, My{Dsmbr, and P5hng Me A*wy.    If you have a surround system, are fan of Linkin Park, and want to hear something that you won;t forget. Buy this DVD-Audio disc.
B0015I2P0Y|3.0|I love to listen to suffering artists (Tchaikovsky, Brahms, and Bruckner are my favorite composers, and I love the works of Nick Drake and Eliott Smith).  I think that applies to Guy Garvey of Elbow, but the lyrics are very dense. That's why Hip-Hop has overtaken Rock in the USA. Kids want to be fed the meaning in songs and on screen so they don't have to think too much. The meaning behind his words is thick in pathos, but the exact points are not clear at all. The melodies say a lot, and I enjoyed it overall, but I tend to be patient with an artist. Overall, it's a good listen, with On Day Like This being the standout number.
B00005A0N5|4.0|Nightwish are an awesome band, Tuomas is a genius! This one has grown on me. Tarja's vocals seemed to calm down over later cd's. Symphonic/Landscape metal at it's best. Finland does this music the best.
1573921394|5.0|A classic, definitely not an easy read. Keynes brings his economic phillosphies into the light. Not the kindest author but his chapter The Marginal Efficiency of Capital is epic and relivent today. Published in 1936, this book stands the test of time and allows you to develop a mental model of numerous business cycles. Who's reading Keynes? Warren Buffet, he quotes Keynes like everyone else quotes Shakespeare.
B0000549B0|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites. Even Jimmy Stewart said that this was his favorite movie to make.
B00110K62U|5.0|This may be my favorite recording of all time.  Amazing story and simply the best cast.  The performances are absolutely top-notch.  Be aware, though, that this is not the musical in its entirety.  This is a concert performance and certain scenes and songs are omitted.  The quality of the cast and performances is more than enough to make up for it.  And I love the encores.    If you want, try before you buy by checking this out from your local library.
B00005NWRS|5.0|This cd is proof that Adam's is a great songwriter. The bonus cd only adds to enjoyment. Well-worth looking for.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This movie is beyond good. I can not bring myself to spoil anything about it, so just see this movie.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I love this movie.  It makes you feel like you are there or would like to be there. I don't need to just watch this at Christmas time any time is good if you need a pick me up.
0786838655|5.0|I borrowed this book from the library after I heard it won an award.  I was planning to read it to my 7 yr old son and at first I was worried about finishing it in the allotted two weeks.  However, both of us enjoyed the story so much, we finished it in just 2 days!  My son even opted to skip watching TV to listen to the book.  My mother who was visiting and doesn't normally like fantasy books also liked it and often sat with us to listen to the story.  My husband heard bits of it in the car and then snuck off with the book after my son went to bed so he could read the entire book himself.    The story is very funny and moves quickly.  It really gets your imagination going picturing the characters and their adventures.
B00008LOS1|5.0|A classic album that has only been made better with it's re-release as a deluce edition. The best part about this reissue is disc two--we already know what is great about the original album. The April 1971 show in which many of the Who's Next songs were played live for the first time is a breathtaking performance. This is saying alot when you consider that this concert comes in an era of truly great Who live performances. A great addition to the Who remastered re-releases.
B000TGCR38|2.0|My title probably says more than I can put into full sentences. This movie mixed the cheesy, swashbuckling, heroic, sanitized-warfare quality of Pearl Harbor (the bad-guys are all ugly, creepy, uncharismatic) with the sheer darkness of genocide and military occupation of Schindler's List (lots of blood, innocent people getting killed). Instead of blending heroic and tragic qualities, with moments of comic relief, like what usually happens in an epic story, the tone of the movie just periodically jumps back and forth between the two. A Schindler's List-Pearl Harbor mash-up would be another way to describe it. I'm throwing in Pulp Fiction because the good-guys aren't heroic in the traditional sense, their main virtues (especially the heroine's) are being coldly rational, calm and calculating. The good-guys (e.g. resistance fighters) also tend to be flawed in various ways (many of them curse Rachel/Ellis with anti-Semitic slurs when they think she's betrayed them).    And then there are a lot cases of women in weird, sexually compromised situations. This might be a good portrayal of what happens to women in wartime, except that our heroine just plugs along, as if all of these twistedly awkward scenes are there to entertain us, which they kind of are. Carice Van Houten does a brilliant job as the heroine, and I would love to see her in another, less nauseating movie someday.    I also detected political undertones that I frankly found disturbing. One of the rich Jewish women who's fleeing the Nazis at the beginning is reluctant to take off a (flashy) diamond necklace when the boat captain tells her it might glitter and alert Nazi soldiers (she says \\"But I've worn this all my life.\\") Nevermind that this is a pretty believable thing for a person in her position to feel, in my opinion, it felt like the director was just rubbing my nose in a stereotype, like, just to be controversial and iconoclastic.    And then there are the opening and ending scenes of the movie, set inIsrael, where the desert is enthusiastically blooming. The ending scene has invisible gunmen shooting at their kibbutz/settlement (founded with the money of Holocaust victims' families as a safe place for refugees, a sign reminds us). Of course we don't see that there are Arabs around there, just gunfire and the Israeli soldiers shooting back. Not seeing those faces is important, because up to this point, the movie was full of characters with complex, morally-ambiguous ways of trying to survive in wartime (excepting the really ugly, ebil characters, who are just ugly and ebil), and seeing Arab faces there would remind us that, like the SS officer that our heroine, Rachel/Ellis, falls in love with, and like other Nazis and Dutch collaborators, these too are people with their own stories, struggles, and complex motives. Instead, we switch to a totally subjective viewpoint of Jews forever dogged by senseless violence. (Because, unlike the Holocaust, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict doesn't have complex, morally ambiguous causes?) These scenes in Israel are only a few short minutes of a long, long movie, but they are important because they frame the whole story.    Two things that I give the movie some points for: 1) the Nazis repeatedly referring to the Dutch resistance as \\"terrorists\\", and 2) portraying them using waterboarding on captured resistance fighters. This probably isn't a very bold statement anywhere other than in the US, where the government tells us waterboarding isn't torture, and Alan Dershowitz argues that we should use torture, because it worked for the Nazis.    I'm very curious how the movie comes across to Dutch viewers.
B0010358CG|3.0|The CG animation is better then ever (not cell-shaded like the last) and looks fantastic.  Shirow's art never looked so good.  The previous film though, was much better written and a lot less predictable.  Ex Machina has distinct story holes and an overly-contrived setup that makes the whole thing seem forced.  Story that should have been more developed wasn't and plot that should have been trimmed was needlessly stretched.    I enjoyed the art, as I usually do with Shirow's work, and the voice acting wasn't bad either, but don't expect a brilliant screenplay.  With the right expectations it's enjoyable for most any Otaku.
B000VNMMR0|2.0|I don't know who thought up the idea of another Die Hard film, this time with the \\"Mac user\\" kid, but this really didn't work for me.  The formula of the rookie/new guy has been done and done well, but I've yet to see a successful rookie/irritating computer hacker formula in a film (\\"Let me got a shoot things, while you conveniently stay here and hack things\\", etc)  It's been done, and the formula is getting tired.<br /><br />I was glad to see Bruce Willis back in action again, and I'm equally impressed with with Wolverine-magnitude fast-healing factor that almost completely recovered him from his earlier injuries (it looks like he was near death in the earlier Police station sequence... but subsequently he healed... magically!)<br /><br />A surprise for me was seeing Kevin Smith in, amazingly, a likeable roll, and even in the unrated version, not once did the customary f-bomb fly out of his mouth (watching his interviews at things like the LA comicon, you'd think he's replaced the word \\"the\\" with the f-bomb.)<br /><br />Anyhow, this film was completely implausable and ridiculous, but it is one of those films that gets you to wondering how long the world would last without electricity, if some terrorist nut (that vaguely resembled an evil Ryan Seacrest) took over the computers of the US.<br />Then again, who really cares...?
0061020710|2.0|I was disappointed.  I've had Terry Pratchett recommended to me by several people to whom I can usually relate when it comes to books.  It seems by some reviews that his books get better, but after this one I'm really not too sure I want to read more of his work.  To all of you Terry Pratchett fans who are going to get up in arms because I negatively reviewed this, I understood all of the \\"deeper meanings\\" and the humor, I even chuckled a few times.  Pratchett just fell very short of creating a masterpiece.  I love dry humor and social commentary, and I consider Douglas Adams a genius, this just seemed like a very poor attempt to emulate Douglas Adams.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|After much research I decided on this unit because of its construction and price.  I am very impressed with it - very well built w/hardware for all types of installation.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|This one really pushes the implausability meter.  I mean, initially it works, and I'm with it.  But when we get up to to the sequences of \\"jumping off a roof through windows and landing perfectly\\" then the serious doubts start to manifest.<br />Great, breath-taking action and jerky cinematography (but would it have killed them to mount the camera, just once, for just one still scene?)<br /><br />The big payoff at the end was sortof a dud.  I won't give spoilers here but... that's it?  That was the big three-years-of-running, three-film secret?<br /><br />I dunno.  Not much of a payoff.  Now Bourne vs. 6-7 super-soldier guys in hand-to-hand.... that would have been cooler.<br /><br />Thumbs down if you need to, but I bet you thought the same thing...
B000LE1GVW|5.0|Before I bought this album I wasn't expecting much, I had only heard a couple of Pauolo's songs and liked them but didn't know much else.  Well I was more than pleasantly suprised!  I love this album!  Pauolo Nutini Rocks my world!  I would recomend this c.d. to anyone!  Awesome rythm and creative songs, along with a very sexy voice make this the best album I have bought all year!

B000JLSM00|5.0|Sheer genius.  One of the greatest American movies of all time.  Ford was never better, Wayne was never better.  Brilliantly book-ended w/ stunning shots of Monument Valley through the front door.  An absolute must-see for any serious movie watcher.  This is one of the half dozen or so greatest movies I've ever seen and I've seen alot.  It's certainly not PC, but it rings true.  Check out this masterpiece.  It gets better w/ repeated viewings......

B000XTLUW0|5.0|If Brian Blessed were a rock band, you suspect he would sound like Muse. From humble beginnings as a kind of cut-price Radiohead, the Devon trio have flourished into a bombastic, over-the-top rock band. Their most recent album, Absolution, underlines their ambition and their audible disinterest in accepted notions of good taste. It's difficult to tell how far their tongues are wedged into their cheeks, but it's equally difficult not to be swept along by their ludicrous, operatic goth metal. Buy this album!!!

B000PMGS8G|2.0|For me, what made this Flash Gordon movie so special was the music by Queen (though Brian Blessed is great!) and if that's what you remember and why you are considering buying this DVD, then DON'T!<br /><br />The images are clear.  The story as campy and fun as ever.  But the music seems to have been phoned in from Hong Kong over a very bad connection.  For me, this ruined everything.  Save your money.  Better to by the CD of the soundtrack!!  How in this day and with the technology available this DVD ever saw the light of day is beyond me.
1400079179|1.0|It has a picture of Mona Lisa's eyes on it.  And there is some jumbled code pealing up, like a page being turned.

And there is a golden circle that says Now A Major Motion Picture on it.
0812975219|2.0|Wow, what a tough book to read and try to follow the author's line of thought!    I guess the author's main point of the book is to take a different viewpoint of risk.  For example, Black Swan events (10 sigma +) do occur and try to always understand the probabilities involved with any issue.    One chapter is dedicated to criticizing the book The Millionaire Next Door by Stanley. The author claims having a lot of millionaires to study is a product of extraordinary times, e.g. the 1982-2000 Bull Market. The author claims there would have been fewer millionaires to study if the time period was the Bear Market of 1968-1982.    Although the author might be right in there were fewer millionaires by number in the early 1980's versus the 1990's, he is dead wrong about the percent of millionaires depending on the stock markets.  Pareto, the Italian economist, found that only 10% to 20% of the population owned 80% to 90% of the wealth in Italy and England in the late 1800's and early 1900's.  In fact, in the U.S. today, about 10% of the population owns 90% of the wealth.  I'm surprised the author is not aware of the Power Law and Pareto's 80:20 Rule as a subset of the Power Law.  Based upon Pareto's work in the late 1800's which still holds true in the 21st Century, Stanley's Wealth Accumulators have always existed.     Stanley's finding that millionaires lived below their means and invested the difference is no big secret per Charles Dickens (1812-1870) in his 1849 David Copperfield, \\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness. Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six, result misery.\\"    The author also argues that Stanley's studies suffered from survivorship bias. He argues that if Stanley had included all the people who saved and invested in losing investments, the net worth of his average millionaire would have been cut in half. I hate to let the author in on another secret that has been around for 2,000 years: don't put all your eggs into one basket as elegantly said in the Talmud, \\"Let every man divide his money into three parts, and invest a third in land, a third in business, and a third let him keep in reserve.\\"  I disagree with the author saying that all investors ignored this age-old advice to diversify their investments.......and therefore drive Stanley's average millionaire's net worth down by 50%.    I do agree that survivorship bias is an important item.  When comparing actively managed mutual funds to passively managed index funds, one should always remember that only the \\"survivor\\" actively managed funds still exist. If the actively managed mutual funds that died or were taken over were included in the numbers, passively managed index funds would be the actively managed by a higher margin.    I found Mauboussin's book, More Than You Know, to be much easier to read and much more thought provoking than this book.  If you are interested in actionable behavior you can take as an investor to overcome behavioral finance tendencies, I recommend Pompian's book, Behavioral Finance and Wealth Management.      In this age of full disclosure, it can be noted that I am the author and publisher of the book INDEX MUTUAL FUNDS: HOW TO SIMPLIFY YOUR LIFE AND BEAT THE PROS. This book is an introduction to the concept of index funds is and is sold on Amazon.

0823015033|1.0|This book is almost an exact duplication of her 2003 book published by Elvenworks Publications. I already had the Elvenwork book and I thought after five years this \\"new\\" Watson-Guptil publication would have something new and improved. It was nothing of the kind. I felt no need to have two books virtually the same so I returned the \\"newest\\" duplicate version. I was truly disappointed.
B00030590I|5.0|It is really frustrating reading the reviews on this movie.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br />If you haven't watched the movie, go watch it.  If you don't get it because the translations are so bad, then you can come read this and watch it again.  IF you still don't get it, email me...<br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />First of all, this IS a martial arts movie.  For anybody who has spent any serious time study martial arts, martial arts isn't just about kicking and punching.  With particular attention to Chinese martial arts, martial arts is very much more about the lifelong pursuit of peace.  There is a graduation from being the fastest, strongest, most able to destroy, focusing on the narcissistic self, to being a sacrificial humble person who seeks to spread morality through influence rather than the sword.<br /><br />The first \\"mind\\" fighting scene should be a HUGE clue into what's coming.  That martial arts is performed more in the mind than with the body.<br /><br />Next, I read a lot of people talking about the \\"fantasy\\" like aspect of the movie.  This is in tradition of many of the literary novels of this period.  The whole movie is about what is going on in the minds of people.  It is the perfect for that purpose.<br /><br />As far as the \\"Dances\\" and all this, it is so frustrating what I read on the reviews here.  The characters who are fighting with each other, if nothing else, have deep respect for each other.  As the stories are retold, they are being retold with admiration and respect for their peers.  The point of the sequences are one to be a retelling of a story, and two, to speak of those that they respect.  They aren't supposed to be \\"real\\".<br /><br />And for those that hate the ending, well, I guess you haven't seen too many asian movies...  Asian movies don't use Disney endings.  The movies are meant to have impact, not give you a good feeling.<br /><br />Further, for those that think that the last guy standing is the \\"good guy\\" in the movie, you need to start being able to see something and make your own decisions about what is right or wrong despite what you see or is told to you.<br /><br />This is not a propaganda movie either, as history did show, a lot of good  did come from this temporary unity, however its cost was terrible.  Further, the asian audience, for whom the movie is made, know too well the history of this Emperor. Besides most already know about the real life account on the attempted assassination of the Emperor and know that this is not really what the story is about.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie, not just because it is pretty, but because of the message it is trying to show.  I mean, who is the real hero? Who was the most powerful?  Who never got it?  Who DID get it?about what is right or wrong despite what you see or is told to you.

B000050XEI|5.0|Enya is amazing. Her music is so relaxing, but never boring. This album is everything you would want in an Enya album. You can tell she put a lot of time in creating this music. So, if you like Enya and don't already own this album, I highly recommend buying it.
B0015KO52S|5.0|Consolers of the Lonely is different than Broken Boy Soldier and in a good way. They have written songs from several genres and made them rock. Broken Boy Soldiers is a great album in its own right. COTL is a different direction and is great for what it is, as well.They have doen great work with lyrics. There are the tell-tale slides from White's guitar that we all love.Track #14, Carolina Drama, is an absolute masterpiece. Terrific lyrics and masterful guitar blended with a great story. This song will live for the ages.<br /><br />I love Broken Boy Soldiers, but I love COTL for different reasons.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I'm very glad I downloaded that single of the week on itunes. This is a great band, but they aren't for everyone.They have a different sound to them. It's a mix of electronic music and 70's-80's music, but it's fantastic! I LOVE the song \\"Kids\\" and \\"Time To pretend\\". Their music is extremely catchy.
6305388458|4.0|Monty Python's \\"Life of Brian\\" lampoons romanticized interpretations of the Gospels by bringing us the tragicomic story of Brian (Graham Chapman), a man born in the same time and place as Jesus Christ, who lived and died under similar circumstances, though a touch more ironic and a lot funnier. When the wise men come from the East, bearing gifts for their infant Savior, they mistakenly enter the wrong stable, where they are berated by Brian's mother (Terry Jones), before they realize their error. Thus begins the life of Brian, who eventually joins the revolutionary People's Front of Judea to resist Roman rule and accidentally acquires a following who believe he is the Messiah.<br /><br />Though clearly inspired by stories about the life of Jesus, \\"Life of Brian\\" is not making fun of Jesus or the words or actions attributed to him. Jesus is only present in one scene in this film and referred to in one other. \\"Life of Brian\\" pokes fun at those who look to others to determine their values and follow their leaders blindly. The ineffectual People's Front of Judea, with its idle leader Reg (John Cleese) and feminist activist Judith (Sue Jones-Davies), satirizes the leftist revolutionary groups of the 1960s and 1970s. The Romans are mocked as sybarites and bureaucrats, the Jews as primitives, and they are all viewed as barbaric.<br /><br />Though its chief purpose is to amuse, \\"Life of Brian\\" is an equal opportunity offender that offhandedly focuses the audience's attention on what the authors consider the important part of the Christian message by persistently knocking everything else off its pedestal. Maybe this film is serious after all. I don't expect orthodox Christians will like it, because it doesn't treat the Gospels reverentially or take them literally. But liberal Christians may appreciate the laughs and even the lesson. I found Brian, himself, too whiney to be likable, but, otherwise, \\"Life of Brian\\" is a clever parody of human ideologies and idiocies, ancient and modern.
069452378X|5.0|The DVD, novel and audiobook of Brideshead Revisited go together so beautifully--wow.  If you haven't seen the miniseries, you are in for a treat--buy or rent the DVD.  Once you've seen the miniseries and read the book, it is wonderful to get the chance to hear Jeremy Irons read it.  Irons is the central character and narrator of the film, so he is a natural choice to do the narration. He may be the best reader in English on the planet!  Highly recommended.
0670018651|5.0|This book is a very useful mine of precious and interesting information not only about parfumes, but about culture and lifestyle as well. The authors did a huge research, and their considerations are to be kept as new interesting perspectives on the wide, and till today poorly studied, world of essences. I believe many people will enjoy it, will be happy to try new paths out of their traditional habits, and will really find the right perfume. Best compliments!

B00005MP58|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this movie to any lover of Jane Austen. This version is very true to the book, Pride and Prejudice; moveover, the scenery is gorgeous in this movie and the acting is well-done. I also would suggest this movie to anyone who has not yet come to Jane Austen--it serves as sort of the \\"gateway\\" to many great literary experiences!
B0000256VK|5.0|excellent!
B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a charming, funny, brave film!  I love the quirkly, intelligent dialogue.  The theme under all the layers of this story is universal... pure love is pure love no matter what the situation, relationship, circumstance!  I fell in love with the real performances delivered by Ellen Page, Jennifer Garner, Jason Bateman, & J.K. Simmons. Diablo Cody is a talented writer & I look forward to her next screenplay.  All elements of this film make it a MUST see!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is just plain bad.  So many missed opportunities.  The screenplay is undermined by the all too predictable love triangle story.  Love and war tales only mixed well in 1980s network television mini-series.  PEARL HARBOR is too long and too complicated.  Additionally, and  unlike its predecessor TORA, TORA, TORA, the action scenes of PEARL HARBOR rely too heavily on CGI.  CGI is great in science fiction films, but appears as a phony video game image when representing actual aircraft.<br /><br />To their credit, the producers were able to borrow an aircraft carrier, fly actual and replica zero aircraft, as well as assembled flyable P-40 Warhawks and B-25 Mitchell bombers.  Unfortunately these aircraft scenes were fluffed up with computer generated images that removed all reality from aerial scenes.<br /><br />The ship scenes are credible, particularly the extensive recreation of the USS Oklahoma's capsizing.  If history alone carried the story this movie would have had a chance.  However, in PEARL HARBOR history played second fiddle to the romance.<br /><br />In PEARL HARBOR it is also annoying to find the main characters everywhere.  Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) begin their military service at Mitchell Field, Long Island.  Sorry Michael Bay, Long Island does not have any dry khaki foothills.  Here Rafe conveniently receives orders to join the Eagle Squadron and fight the Luftwaffe.  The RAF's Eagle Squadron was not an organization that was eligible for US Army Air Corps orders.  In order to participate in the Eagle Squadron -- or the Flying Tigers, for that matter -- an officer would have had to resign his commission and left the service.  Of course it was the only way to separate Rafe from his love interest Navy nurse Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale).<br /><br />Rafe is shot down by a Messerschmitt and presumed dead thus freeing Evelyn to fall in love with Rafe's best friend Danny.  Danny's squadron along with Evelyn and her nurse peers find themselves shipped out to Hawaii.  Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up. Not only is Rafe alive and well, he is also an ace.  The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor interrupts the romantic debacle as Rafe and Danny put aside their differences take to the air against the Zeros.  After some fancy CGI flying, both pilots return to donate blood for the wounded and rush off to the anchorage to assist with the rescue effort.<br /><br />Rafe and Danny then volunteer to become bomber pilots and join General Doolittle in his raid on Tokyo.  Danny sacrifices his life to save Rafe and resolving the uneasiness between the two over Evelyn.  Thus Rafe is free to return to a pregnant Evelyn and both remember Danny through his son.<br /><br />War and romance do not mix.  ENEMY AT THE GATES was proof of that.<br /><br />PEARL HARBOR  boasts some great supporting actors with Alec Baldwin as General Doolittle, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Dorie Miller, and Jon Voight doing a great job portraying President Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Their roles could have been better had the movie not been crowded with a love story.<br /><br />A lot of work went into this movie.  When I went to see the film I brought a copy of PEARL HARBOR: THE MOVIE AND THE MOMENT to read while waiting for the film to begin.  After leafing through the book I expected much more from the film.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett fans will probably enjoy this film, but military history enthusiasts should snub it all together.Evelyn no sooner swoons for Danny when Rafe shows up.

B00166996S|2.0|SONG: \\"Starlight\\"[[ASIN:B000XTLUWA Haarp]]<br />Yes, it WAS a dark stormy night and I wasn't paying enough attention. True, the song title had HAARP next to it and I didn't stop to think \\"What's that mean?\\" That said, I just want to warn others that if you're wanting the pretty, happy song you've heard on the radio or on PBS commercials.....this a'int it, babe. This is some kind of concert/live version of the song \\"Starlight\\". While die-hard fans of Muse may love this version just as much as the album, the rest of us may want to click the \\"Sample\\" button before downloading this track. Trust me----it'll save you from having a WTF moment like I did. By the way, you cannot download this song alone (I found this out later) you can only get the full album.
B00006F7XJ|5.0|Released in 2002, this is probably the last Camel album, ever (especially since Latimer said so).  It is about 54 minutes long and the sound quality is excellent.      The band is Andy Latimer on guitar and flute (and he plays a lot more flute than usual and it is all beautiful).  The back up muscians are Colin Bass on bass (who has been with Latimer for about 25 years) plus relatively new people on drums and keyboards.      This album goes back to the great progressive music of the early 1970's.  It is beautiful and artistic but interesting and emotional music.  Some of it sounds like classic Camel.  Other part sound like early Genesis, back when Peter Gabriel would play the flute.  Other parts remind of the best of Focus's long flowing movements.      The ablum isn't perfect (but close).  Some of it might be a little bit too whimsical (especially the title and cover).  The three minute instrumental, The Miller's Tale, really adds nothing and could have been left off of the CD.  But those are minor quibbles.      Camel was a progressive English quartet that formed in the 1972.  The only musician in the band with any kind of track record was Peter Bardens who played on Them (Van Morrison's old band).  They put out 4 great progressive albums before imploding for the usual drug problems, artistic differences and the public's changing musical tastes.  Eventually, only Latimer was left and he carried on the band name (although he picked up Colin Bass in 1978, who has been with Camel ever since). In 1990 \\"Camel\\" moved to the US in the South Bay Area (Mountain View, near San Jose).   Peter Bardens had a nice solo career but died in 2001.    There is a very rare live recordng floating about from tour done by a band consisting of Bardens and some of his solo band members and member of Caravan.
B0013ISU0A|5.0|This album represents what REM used to stand for, which is good old fashioned, angst ridden, cleverly phrased protests college rock. I have been an avid fan since 1982. I pickED up my first album at the age of 9 from an friends older brother. This band is the best band in the world and this album signifies a shift from the fluff of the late 90's into the creative and empowering music that they are capable of. Good job Mike and Company. Keep on rocking!!!!

1563523302|5.0|I wish everyone would read this book. You assume someone to be rich because of their car, or clothes. That just proves that they waste more money and probably go into debt for it.     I spent time as a financial analyst for a commercial lending department. Part of my job was to go through people's personal financial statements. My boss, a CPA, recommended this book to me. On of our wealthiest, millionare clients wore sweat pants, had a mullet, and drove an old beat up vehicle. We had another client who was always sporting the latest fashions and drove a Porsche, but was broker than broke and always pleading with us to not return her checks.     The key is to have the self confidence to not spend the money to fix the way people judge you. Would you rather have 10 million dollars and look like crap or be on the edge of bankruptcy and look like a million bucks? I refuse to spend that kind of money to impress someone I probably don't even like or people I don't even know.    Read this book, it will shed some clarity!
B0012IV3RS|2.0|After waiting forever to see this film, perhaps I was too built up. Lots of Fulci fans list this film as one of his best. However I think it's nowhere near the level of City of The Living Dead or The Beyond. Not even as good as House by the Cemetery IMO. You've been warned.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|I don't think this has an exceptional plot. I don't think it's exceptionally thick. I do, however, LOVE LOVE LOVE the fact that it gives me that warm fuzzy Christmas feeling just thinking about the movie. For that I give it an A+
B000002J0B|5.0|A while back, 'Rolling Stone' magazine called Led Zeppelin 'the greatest heavy metal band of all-time.' I have to agree with them. I don't think Zeppelin falls under the metal genre, but they are pretty heavy. I'd say just hard rock, in general.    Anyhow, the 1973 classic sounds just as good today as it did all those years ago. John Bonham's drumming in 'The Ocean' is worth the price of the album alone, and Plant's timeless voice on 'The Rain Song' followed by peaceful guitar from Jimmy is essential.    The whole record is a masterpiece. 'The Song Remains The Same' is arguably the heaviest song the group ever recorded, and 'D'yer M'aker' samples a more reggae sound. Bonham's drumming is slower on this one than usual, but it's still timeless.    Overall, if you don't have this record already, you are missing out. Highly recommended for any Zep fan. A masterpiece.    ENJOY!!!
B00133KFGW|3.0|I really struggled with the rating scale on this one, so I'll break it down a little this time.<br /><br />Music: Outstanding.  Easily a 5/5.  Or maybe a 6/5.<br /><br />Cast: Perfect.  5/5. Keri Russell and Jonathan Rhys Meyers portray their characters quite nicely.  Freddie Highmore does an excellent job as \\"August Rush\\" but I have to say that Jamia Simone Nash stole the show with her larger than life voice (and the fact that she's just adorable). Robin Williams did a nice job in his role, however I didn't enjoy his character (see plot below).<br /><br />Plot: 2/5. The one night stand on top of a building in the middle of the night with two people that didn't even know each other made it hard to feel a strong connection or desire to see them reunite more than eleven years later.  The creepy \\"pimp\\" character (Williams) was more than a little disturbing in my opinion, especially when he controlled a bunch of young children. Also I had a big problem with how the last scene of the movie played out. I do not wish to spoil it for anyone who has yet to see the movie, but the logistics of the entire ending scene I thought to be pretty outlandish even for a \\"fairy tale\\" movie.<br /><br />Message: 4/5. Music transcending boundaries, not losing faith despite obstacles or disappointment, lamenting the fact that you weren't a child music prodigy...<br /><br />Overall enjoyable. You've got to have a little appreciation for music in order to really like this one, as well as a little imagination and ability to overlook some of the outlandish portions of the plot.
B000002LCX|4.0|This is The Smiths's swansong (barring any reunion album, which, sadly, is probably not going to happen), and it generally gets mixed reviews from Smiths fans. I think it's a near masterpiece.  It's not as vibrant as other Smiths' albums, but it's still damn good and there are some magnificent songs that can stand up to any of the Smiths's classics.  The opener, A Rush and the Push and the Land Is Ours, is a beautiful, haunting pop number that only the Smiths can do well.  I like Death of a Disco Dancer, and its extended instrumental break.  It's reminiscent of Barbarism Begins at Home (off Meat is Murder), and it's very powerful.  Girlfriend in a Coma is one of Morrissey's best lyrics, a cutish, poppy song set to a lyric where the protagonist really wants his girlfriend to die (that's so sweet).  Stop Me If you Think... is a great single that gets better everytime I listen to it.  I rather like Death at One's Elbow, even though most people dislike this song for some reason.<br /><br />But the masterpiece of the album is Paint a Vulgar Picture.  It's one of the greatest songs The Smiths ever recorded.  It has a great melody and some of Morrissey's most acidic, acerbic, and brilliant lyrics ever.  The song is also one of his most timely, as when a big dead rock star dies, there's always leeches who come out of the floorboards to claim to have known the real person (the sycophantic slags, as St. Morrissey calls them).  He also berates the record companies for repackaging everything.  How many times has one had to \\"double dip\\" on CD reissues with crappy extra tracks (like rehearsals), or on a DVD?  F***ing greed is all it is, and Morrissey's sings about it with grace and intelligence.  Brilliant man, brilliant band.<br /><br />Even if you're a casual Smiths listener, you should still pick this one up.  It may not be as good as the other albums, but it's still amazing in its own way.
B0015I2P0Y|5.0|I discovered Elbow on itunes a few years ago and grow more deeply in love with them with every album. I began with the song \\"Snowball\\" off a special compilation CD and couldn't believe my ears. After finding more of their songs on itunes I downloaded every album. I fell instantly in love with \\"Station Approach\\" which practically still makes me cry every time I hear it because it is simply just so gorgeous. I love sweeping epic tunes, like \\"Firth of Fifth\\" by Genesis, \\"The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys\\" by Traffic, \\"In the Presence of\\" by Yes, \\"Life on Mars\\" by David Bowie. You can add \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" on that list...and about a third of the songs on this new CD. \\"Mirrorball,\\" \\"One Day Like This,\\" and \\"The Bones of You,\\" mesmerize me to no end. I haven't stopped listening to all three for days. A close second is \\"The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver.\\" I could listen to Guy Garvey's voice for hours and never bore of him. While I want to keep them secret I also want to shout from the rooftops that they are some of the most talented musicians out there (so much more melodic and layered than Coldplay...although I agree with someone else that commented that \\"Yellow\\" is probably one of the more beautiful songs I have heard in a long time as well.) Elbow's newest album does not disappoint and I can only hope that they get their proper recognition...but hopefully after I get to see them live in a small venue like Omaha's Slowdown!

B000B8QF14|5.0|If you are a GreenDay fan this is a must have. The DVD is excellent and the CD is the same as the DVD so you can carry it around on your Ipod.    I love the music and love watching the guys.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|There is too much rubbish on here, and that makes it an extremely inconsistent album. Gone are the days of 'black celebration' and 'violator'. I realy dislike 'john the revelator'. Tuneless and horrid. 'Nothing's impossible' is a meandering, boring mess and the instrumental 'Introspective' is pretty pointless, although it does sound a bit like the eerie music from 'the ring'. 'Sinner in me' is merely ok, with a protracted, unecessary fade out. I am a fan of Gore's vocal tracks, but, while 'Micro' begins well, it soon falters and is still Gore's worst solo spot on any album, since 'pipeline'.  Some of the rest is very good indeed. 'Precious' is classic mode and has an instantly catchy and melodious hook. I like Gore's second vocal 'damaged people', good melody.  Too much distorted voices everywhere. 'Lilian' is nice, but don't like a lot of the effects on the voices.

1591841984|5.0|This book is amazing.  I read one chapter in a bookstore, and proceeded to stay on the couch for 3 more hours.    We all know that Steve Jobs is incredible- this book offers an insightful glance inside the philosophy and strategy that has led to his monumental success.    As an artist and designer, the marketing advice alone is invaluable, not to speak of Steve's creative process and his method for harnessing creativity in others.    Buy this book + study it closely- it will be well worth your time and money.
B00007K02F|1.0|I won't take a long time writting this review. Simply put, this film is horrible in my opinion because (1) it leaves out so many scenes that are vival to understanding Jane's passion, (2) its acting is far from superior, (3) its sets are no better than in the 1983 BBC Jane Eyre, and (4) the film costs as much money as many of the other Jane Eyre versions that are considerably more accurate and better produced.<br /><br />Now, for people who have read the novel \\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte, they realize that a man named St. John Rivers plays an important role in the novel. In this film, St. John and his sisters all but eliminated. The same situation of elimination occurs for many other minor characters. The dialogue from the novel that is kept is combined and changed from classic English to modern American. I am sorry if people have a problem hearing the long discussions Jane and Edward have together. However, for a literature fanatic, this Jane Eyre version is much to short - lacking in intelligence.<br /><br />I personally recommend the 1983 Jane Eyre version starring Timothy Dalton as Edward Fairfax Rochester, and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre. The BBC film keeps nearly all of the dialogue and many of the scenes. The BBC 1983 film is far more intelligent and insightful into the struggles Jane Eyre faces. For those who dislike Timothy Dalton playing Rochester, I recommend the 1973 BBC adaptation starring Michael Jayston as Rochester. It is also a powerful adaptation, and Jayston actually appears quite vulcan-like.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|I was watching an episode of  the Chappelle Show once and in it there was a hilarious skit about him being a juror in an MJ trial and he defends MJ's 'innocence' I think this line which he says pretty much sums up, the magnificence of Michael Jackson and why he will always be the King of pop.<br /><br />I grew up in the time when this album was released, and some of the tunes on this record are still dance hall classics. No matter what genre you belong to, Death Metal, Classical, Jazz, Indie poop, or whatever. Thriller would have touched your musical element at some point in your existence.<br />This album is a classic record, right from Beat it to Billie Jean, Ballads - Human Nature and Lady in my life (MJ goes supernova on this track, whatta love song).. every track on this album is pure gold and am glad to see they are celebrating 25 years in a befitting tribute to this record.<br />This album is a benchmark and i do recommend for you to get this CD.<br />Great Times!
B000784WMW|5.0|This BBC version of Jane Eyre starring Timothy Dalton is the best version I have seen. Now, I must say that I have not yet seen the Masterpiece Theatre version. However, compared with the Miramax 1996 version or 1997 A&E version, this adaptation is considerably better.<br /><br />  What I liked about the BBC 1983 version is that I can picture the characters in their respective roles. For example, Timothy Dalton is everything I imagined Edward Fairfax Rochester as being - smart, sarcastic, cynical, etc. In addition, Zelah Clarke plays Jane Eyre very well. She brings a serious tone to Jane's character. Some television editions of Jane Eyre 'tick me off' by having an older teenager girl (who has no maturity) play this important role. The acting does not convince me and ruins the film.<br /><br />  Now, obviously, the special effects in this 1983 BBC production could hardly be worse, especially the fire scenes. However, if an audience gets over the fact that this is an older film with a low budget, you can overlook this flaw.<br /><br />  Finally, this film appeals to me because it takes much of the dialogue straight from the book. Certainly, there are a few minor scenes from the book that are left out or slightly compressed. However, for the most part, this film is perfectly loyal to the novel. In fact, I probably shouldn't say, but this film is so accurate that you could probably pass a reading comprehension test on the novel \\"Jane Eyre\\" simply by watching this film one or two  times and taking notes.<br /><br />  That being said, I certainly enjoyed this film, found it loyal, found it interesting, and recommend it to anyone who feels good acting and accurate dialogue are important.<br /><br />Also recommended: Jane Eyre (1973)
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|This comes from the latest inductee to the rock and roll hall of fame...Madonna, and it really is the worst album she`s ever released.

B0009W5K0Y|4.0|I was torn between giving this three or four stars. To be honest, it is not the best or even that close to being a favourite of mine, but anyway. In comparison, I think that All We Know... has more rawer feel to it than Riot! does, and this I prefer. Though the lyrics may not be the most varied or topical, they are not bad. Though Paramore are dubbed as pop-punk generally, there are some hardcore elements in there, which I think are lost on Riot!. This is a bit of a shame because it adds an edge to the otherwise lightness of the album. This is evident in the riffage of Emergency, the slight looseness from the formula of All We Know, and the screaming in finale My Heart. Hayley Williams' voice also carries more angst than a pop-punk singer her age would be thought to. I don't think is might be better than Riot!, but it is less polished and has a lot less attitude which for me is a good thing.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|After two careful listens, it's very clear that Portishead was determined to avoid the commercially recognizable sound from their earlier CDs. They succeed dramatically. Do not buy \\"Third\\" expecting an approachable extension to their genre-defining trip-hop sound. Adrian Maben's use of the wah pedal is completely gone, and in fact he's not as heavily used on this disc. There's also absolutely no tying to Gibbons' stellar solo work, which has largely disappeared from the market anyway. Geoff Barrow dominates this disc sonically and very likely in the songwriting department as well. The drum parts are even sparer than previous releases and the mix is deliberately quiet and subtly muffled, although very clean even in the MP3s. The noir vibe is completely gone. This is basically rock music written by Samuel Beckett.<br /><br />In fact, this disc reminds me more of Massive Attack's 100th Window than anything else I've heard from this band - bleak, depressing, and sonically uninviting. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the intention is to take their substantial fan base to a new place and recognize that they've grown and changed as musicians and can't or won't give their ravening public another \\"Glory Box.\\" In that goal, I feel Portishead succeeds only intermittently, because the music on this disc is so resistant to accessibility for the most part.<br /><br />The first four tracks, \\"Silence,\\" \\"Hunter,\\" Nylon Smile\\" and \\"The Rip\\" probably convey a more recognizably Portishead sound than the rest of the disc. \\"Silence\\" produces a fairly balanced sound with the spare but steady rhythm, heavily distorted guitar parts and Gibbons' impersonal wails about another failed relationship (at least that's what the lyrics seem to convey). \\"Hunter\\" provides interesting shifts between distorted instrumental interludes and a dark, stalking instrumental background for Gibbons' haunting vocals, and comes closest to the old Portishead sound. Likely the most accessible track on this disc is \\"The Rip,\\" which applies a nylon-string guitar to establish the basic harmony of the song paired with a gorgeous Gibbons vocal. The tune then steps up with a strong sequencer part echoing the guitar patterns and takes the song in an emotionally moving direction. At this point I was very optimistic for the rest of the CD.<br /><br />Most of the rest of \\"Third\\" is brutally depressing and deeply dissonant at the same time. With the exception of \\"Deep Water,\\" a lovely ode to suicide that almost sounds like a church hymn, there's very little here to grab a listener who loved their previous work. \\"Small\\" uses a cello-like synth part along with two-part vocal harmonies and another dissonant intrumental break. Don't play this stuff at a party. That is, unless the party features lots of aggressively challenging art and perhaps an S&M station or two, or at least some blond bare-chested Germans wandering around in leather chaps. (Now is the time on Sprockets when we daaahhhnce.) DARK is the operating word here.<br /><br />I have a strong suspicion that many people will feel like they HAVE to like this disc, it being what it is and whom it's from. (Sarcasm) No pressure. If you're not sufficiently hip or discerning because you don't appreciate \\"Third,\\" just go back to your meaningless middle-class existence and LEAVE US COOL PEOPLE, DRESSED IN OUR COOL BLACK CLOTHES, ALONE! (/sarcasm) My guess is that attitude would be one which the band itself would reject. I personally think it's pretty cool that Portishead is back working together and wanted to do something challenging to reject the explosive commercialism surrounding their previous work.

B000YENUI6|5.0|The progressive artistic decantation of David Cronenberg through all these years is more than obvious. Since \\"Spider\\", \\"A history of violence\\" and now with his \\"Eastern promises\\"  have become him a true referential director, with a very personal style and absolute domain of the cinematographic language. His films are featured by a distinctive expression without necessarily falling into a \\"commercial label\\". He just leaves besides unanswered questions, like this terrible fact around the presence of the Russian mob in London.<br /><br />Cronenberg makes of the violence not a goal but a device to justify it as a mere surviving mechanism. Two well opposite extremes of an ethic chain like a nurse and a driver of the son of a well known \\"Russian Godfather\\" will involve themselves around a painful circumstance.<br /><br />The entire cast was splendid, but it's worthy to remark the impressive performance of Vigo Mortensen as the cold driver and the absorbing acting of Armin Mûller Stahl (Symeon) one of the ten best living actors in the world , make of this original proposal a must see.<br /><br />Don't miss it!

1416523359|3.0|This is allegedly King's bold experiment in a new prose style.  Wrong.  He began the looser style when he wrote DREAMCATCHER with a fountain pen.  The style was novel and enjoyable then, but it's beginning to be an experiment in tedium.      Let me say for the record: It's a decent book, but I almost quit it a couple of times.  The book doesn't really \\"start\\" for about 150 pages, and the choice to change editors (he decided to use a female instead of his usual--Chuck Verril) was, in my opinion, a mistake.  The book is a bit schizophrenic.  Additionally, the repetitious phrases and ideas are endless and in part attributable to the \\"new\\" prose style.  Again, poor editing.    What bothered me most about this book was that it was supposedly King's first foray into romance, with blurb by Nicholas Sparks on the back cover.  It's not a romance, however, and this attempt to market the book as \\"cross-genre\\" is pandering.  The book is a supernatural love story in the vein of King's BAG OF BONES, but that doesn't make it a romance.      If you're a King fan and can tough out the first third of the novel, you'll like it.  But it's not his best by a longshot.

0618001905|5.0|Anyone who wants to understand the Congo should read two books, King Leopold's Ghost by Adam Hochschild and and [[ASIN:0060934433 In the Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz: Living on the Brink of Disaster in Mobutu's Congo]].  Together, they explain why the last 100 years of bloody tyranny has laid the groundwork for possibly 100 more.<br /><br />I would also heartily recommend both books to anyone studying Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which is too seldom seen as an historic account as well as a literary novel.<br /><br />Hochschild gives us the first half of the century in a grim story told within the larger picture of a world of developed nations gone mad for colonies.  The top of the food chain, England, Germany, and France, are scrambling to lock down markets for their goods and resource-rich lands to supply their bustling industrial economies.  King Leopold of Belgium, a man whose inferiority complex knows no bottom and whose greed no limits, jumps into the feeding frenzy and comes up gripping the very heart of Africa, the vast area around the Congo River and it's tributaries that would later become the Belgian Congo, then Zaire, and today is the Democratic Republic of Congo.  This is the setting for my novel, [[ASIN:1601641575 Heart of Diamonds: A Novel of Scandal, Love and Death in the Congo]].<br /><br />It's easy to focus on the horrors of Leopold's Congo, but there is much more to the story than endless accounts of sadistic whippings and dismemberments, as bestial as they might be.  Hochschild tells us, too, how Leopold was able to pull off this massive decades-long crime through manipulation of the media, well-placed bribes and partnerships, and first subversion and then repression of his critics.  The holocaust he visited on Congo--as many as 8 million indigenous people were killed--could have been the template for Adolph Hitler's.<br /><br />This book also gives us a detailed look at the little clerk who eventually brought Leopold's rule of terror to an end.  He was Edmund Morel, a Liverpool shipping agent was stumbled on evidence of Leopold's crimes and devoted the rest of his life to exposing them.  He became one of the world's first investigative journalists and eventually built a propaganda machine of his own to rub the world's face in Leopold's stink.  Hochschild also gives us a look at black American journalist George Washington Williams, who wrote the first indictment of Leopold in 1890.  Valerie Grey, the protagonist of [[ASIN:1601641575 Heart of Diamonds: A Novel of Scandal, Love and Death in the Congo]], is a TV journalist whose dedication to getting out the truth about what she found in the DRC matches that of these men.<br /><br />There are other striking themes in King Leopold's Ghost.  One is how the terror didn't end when the world forced Leopold to turn Congo over to the state of Belgium.  It had been his personal possession, not a colony originally--and actually, he sold it to his own subjects in a final act of wringing the last nickel out of his prize.  The new \\"owners\\" continued many of the gruesome practices Leopold's minioins had perfected, continuing to suck the lifeblood out of the colony.<br /><br />Another powerful theme is how quickly the world turned its back.  Less than a century later, thousands of visitors to the extravagent monuments Leopold built see no sign that they are drenched in the blood of millions of Africans.  When the colonial era ended, Belgium walked away from the Congo, leaving it with no Congolese engineers, army officers, doctors, or even bureaucrats--of 5,000 civil service positions, only three were filled by Africans.<br /><br />Michela Wrong picks up the contemporary story of the Congo with In The Footsteps of Mr. Kurtz.

I had read a very scathing review of the soundtrack that called it \\"forgettable, \\" which is the exact opposite of what the soundtrack is. I found the music did exactly what it was supposed to do in musically illustrating and complementing the film and setting the mood. The lovely melodies really stuck in my mind and I could not wait to get a copy of the soundtrack. Bravo to Mr. Williams, Yo Yo Ma and Isak Perlman for doing such a superb job of musically interpreting the story!

1400063515|1.0|Taleb claims the book 'practically wrote itself;' what he really means, is that he just lifted some ideas from old philosophers and let Word do the rest.     The Black Swan provides an interested reader with important insights, no doubt, but they are nothing new. Indeed, possibly the most frustrating aspect of this book is how vainglorious its author is. He claims he felt 'vindicated' on Black Monday ... How? All Taleb has done is taken others ideas and repackaged them. While he was correct to believe them in the first place, there is little of the author in the book. Worse still, the author disregards his own rules. Early in the book Taleb claims that with respect to foreign affairs, the best answer is, \\"I don't know,\\" (because there are so many unknowns it's best not to assume them away). A little while later, however, he goes on a tirade against the use of the phfrase \\"Hardened by the Gulag.\\" Taleb claims that the Gulag did not harden the mobbsters, instead it simply selected teh most physically fit (because all others would die), who were also the most aggresive to begin with. Notwithstanding this latter assumption, he also implicitly assumes no psychological component was present; a clear violation of his 'don't assume' policy. While this is relatively minor (although extremely aggrivating given Taleb's hubris and constant patronization) it is a clear example of Taleb's consistent lack of vision. Moreover, he constantly uses inappropriate and verbose language (indeed, it seems the Taleb wasn't honest at the beginning, and instead it was the book, PLUS Word's thesaurus who wrote The Black Swan).    Readers, I implore you, save yourself some money: get some Russel, Hume, and Bacon out from your local library and bookmark an online thesaurus. Whenever you think you may want to read The Black Swan, just take any sentence from the above philosophers, pick AT LEAST TWO words and use the thesaurus to find their synonyms and from those, pick the largest everytime and replace the origional word. Now you will be, for all intents and purposes, reading the Black Swan.

All the tracks are written by Madonna along with cowriters Timbaland and JT on a few tracks.<br /><br />While every track isn't off the hook for the majority of the CD.  Madonna doesn't disappoint with tracks like \\"Voices\\" \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\", \\"Dance 2night (should be next single) to name just a few that could easily be singles.  A couple however i thought were just ok and they are \\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\".  They werent bad or anything its just neither of those tracks peaked my interest.  But out of 12, 10 being listen worthy several times in the future.  I think its an overall job very well done and with different influences in the songs from pop to R&B to Rap and dance.<br /><br />I believe Hard Candy will get anyone into Madonna in a whole new light minus the cd cover which unfortunately isn't all that, but thats a very small hit nothing major.

Compare Hard Candy's art to that of Confessions on a Dance Floor? We go from Glitz and Glamour to complete and utter rabble. The songs are disgusting, the production is uneven and contrived at best. I guess the Material girl is past it and running out of ideas and producers to work with. Come now, there are scores of more capable musicians and producers out there!! Instead of focusing on idle frivolity, \\"Hard Candy\\" would have been better suited to more lyrical material (perhaps \\"Soul Kiss\\" from Olivia Newton-John's failed 1985 album of the same name.) If Madonna insists on hanging on to her youth for dear life, she could have at least made it half way believable \\"Physical\\" anyone?? Alas, this album really is a waste of creativity or lack there of.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|There are only a handful of movies that I can watch over and over. And this is one of them, very close to the top of the list. (Others that come to mind are the 1st Back to the Future and Matrix episodes, Hitchcock's Rear Window, Mary Popins (sans the animated bit) and The Fifth Element.)These films are not diminished by multiple viewing, in fact, it enhances them.<br /><br />Everything works in this film: Will Ferrell's understated acting is in delicious counterpoint to the warmth, and girlish spikishness of Gyllenhaal. Likewise Thompson and Latifah. The dialogue is quirky and quick so that it still surprises even at the 10th sitting. One is constantly being tempted to draw metaphysical conclusions along the way, only to be brought back into the zany reality of the film by the gentle humor of the script.<br /><br />Get it. Unlike many others, it keeps on giving.

The movie scences were proportionately and logically out of whack - which made the movie a bit like reading through a poorly organized comic book.

Gypsies taking a boat to the equivelant of the artic get there in a very short period of time... a blimp seems to get there in half the time...  The freezing snow and ice are only formidable in a couple of scences...      The movie ending seemed designed \\"only\\" to launch a sequel.  Unlike the great movies such as the lord of the rings and the Godfather the ending felt like the director just cut one long movie in half to get people to buy two movies instead of one...    Sorry but this movie should be sold for half price.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Yes, I'm now a fan of Pink. I started out just thinking she was just overblown and junk that my step kids liked. But now that I've given her a good listen I have to say she can rock with the best of them. Yes, I was totally wrong and this is a very good CD to get!    Jeff
0201633612|5.0|unlike the last pattern book i reviewed (see my other reviews), this one has an attractive cover.  i like blue.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Yup REM has come back with just another great piece of work. This just goes to prove that the cream always will rise to the top. And in the case of REM this is never been so true. I've always loved this band and will always. Get this CD!!    Jeff
B000RO9PXC|5.0|Wonderful that these live concerts are being made available.  They're a little \\"rough,\\" but the listener REALLY hears The Doors.  Must have for dedicated Doors fans.  Price, shipping and handling very fair.  A+.
B000K15VSA|5.0|There is no other vertion of theis movie to get. if you are a true fan of Blade runner then you have to own this addition.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|Great that these live concerts are being made available.  Hope there are more coming.  Not for everyone; a \\"must have\\" for the dedicated Doors fan.  Price was fair, as was shipping and handling.  A+.
B000RG1FMO|2.0|The stuff on this album is ok, but it doesn't seem to be anything all that different or that much better than the hip hop or rap from the past. I guess he should get extra points for not promoting the thug life like many artists in his genre do. This sounds like compentent stuff, but I just don't hear anything that's blowing my mind here. Kinda makes me yawn when compared to the old school stuff. I mean, great for him that he's selling tons of records, etc. But so did Britney Spears, so obviously that's not a sure sign of artistic merit on its own.    I can only assume that those who continually use the word \\"genius\\" when talking about West are simply buying into his press hyperbole as much as he is himself.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I watched this series when it first came to DVD, and bought it soon after. Just this past Christmas I bought one for a friend and one for my Dad. The series is absolutely amazing in it's depth. You become very involved with the characters, and understand a little of what they went though during the war. I have watched the entire series four times now, and still find myself watching it occasionally when it airs on the history channel every so often. You will not be disappointed with Band of Brothers.
1416523359|4.0|Over the years, Stephen King has written his readers all kinds of monsters, some grotesque, some beautiful, and some merely silly.  When his books work well, they're terrifying not just because of the frightening central conceit of the story, but because King is absolutely fantastic at projecting normalcy.  His protagonists and their lives seem absolutely authentic, so grounded and consistent and reliable that after the first few pages you're almost convinced that they're real.  And, more than that, you identify with them, you know how they think, it's almost as if they've become a close friend of yours.  Then, King ratchets up the tension, brings in whatever scary monster he's dreamed up, and simulates his protagonists' reaction to them so convincingly that when the protagonists are scared, you're scared too.  In this way, he's able to wring the maximum possible effect out of his storylines.      When all this is combined with a great monster idea - not just a scary-looking dead thing, but a supernatural creature whose interactions with the protagonists dramatizes an ordinary human tragedy, the end result is a scary and emotionally intense novel that explore the cracks and crevices of that tragedy through a supernatural conceit.  In The Shining, for example, King told a story about how alcoholism and addiction can make one a monster to one's own family and friends, even to those one loves above all others through the awfully scary device of a haunted hotel.       Here, King does it again, exploring the process of grieving through the literary conceit of a supernatural world called Boo'ya Moon.  It's not very scary in the way some readers might expect, and it might be difficult to access because of the language, but it's a truly moving account of how Lisey puts her life together after her husband's death. In the last pages, King pulls out all the narrative stops, and it's hard not to be deeply moved.    Of course, none of it works if you just can't adjust to Lisey'scrazy, idiomatic slang, because if you can't stand her \\"voice,\\" you can't possibly hope to make your way through 500 pages of personal narrative.  That's true for pretty much every first-person fictional novel, from Sound and the Fury to David Copperfield.    But, if you CAN adjust, you'll come to understand that the reason Stephen chooses to tell his story this way is to bring you deeper into Lisey's mind, into her life, to make you think the way she thinks so that you can love her crazy sister Manda-bunny despite her weirdness and you can fall in love with Scott despite the scars in his personality left by his torturous past.  That personal attachment is essential to this book, because, after all, this is a book about grief, and it's impossible to fully comprehend another's grief unless you know, really know, not only the person grieving but the person who died.  The tragedy of death in a family doesn't come clear unless you understand what it's like to have a relative who might be weird and might be crazy and might give you hell half the time, but somewhere underneath you love them anyway, and the last thing in the world you want is to have to say good-bye to them forever.     So, I think it's a great book. The only reason I haven't given it five stars is because, even though Stephen wrote some wonderful, moving, intense things in this book, he can never quite resist using a couple of cheap tricks, splashing the blood and gore around a tad more than he really needs to, and being a little more explicit than is strictly necessary.  That touch of vulgarity, I think, keeps even his best books from really deserving a five-star rating.

B0014Z4OQG|1.0|THIS REVIEW HAS SPOILERS.    When trying to think of a movie with worse camera work or a more retarded plot, I simply can't do it.  This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen.  The camera jerks around badly, and if you're subject to motion sickness, you should take something before watching this crapfest.  There is no character development, so when people start dying you end up thinking to yourself, \\"oh well.  Probably had that coming.\\"  And in the end, not only are all the characters dead, but we still don't have any answers like:  What happens to the monster?  At the end of the movie, he's still eating skyscrapers and beating the snot out of the army.      Don't watch this crap; you'll end up wishing that you had your 90 minutes back.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|I have been a fan since I had to beg my parents for the $5.98 to buy her first album (yes, album) in 1983.  Having followed Madonna's musical journey for 25 years has been an amazing experience - and every album she's ever released has been one I've looked forward to with excitement.<br /><br />25 years on, I *really* like this CD.  I think Madonna (and hopefully many of her fans) have gotten past the whole notion of her having to be 'better' on every CD than the one(s) that came before it.  There are lots of enjoyable tracks on this project - the catchy 4 Minutes, Heartbeat, She's Not Me, Miles Away, Spanish Lesson, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You and Voices.  Hopefully the fact that I've listed almost every song on it is indicative of how much I enjoy it.<br /><br />Admittedly, there's a part of me that wishes that Madonna would release something along the lines (creatively) of Ray of Light or Like a Prayer, the latter of which is in my top 5 favorites of all time.  But musically, that's not where we are anymore - like it or not, she has to compete with today's pop machine.  The consolation is that there are few who can beat her at the game she largely invented.
B000YABYLA|1.0|Before getting this movie I read the reviews here. I thought either this movie is going to be bad, or there are a lot of people who want to slam this movie. I was shocked to find out this movie was bad.     First, it is nothing special in terms of performance or script. Juno is the story of a teen girl who gets pregnant. And has the most fun pregnancy ever. Her parents are all ok with her pregnancy, and she even finds a yuppy family to take the baby. Juno herself never seems to deal with the ramifications. One scene after giving birth with a few tears, you can't tell if she is emotional from drugs or what.     But for me there were real man disliking problems littered in the script. They come mostly with the yuppie couple set to adopt the baby. Marc, the husband, is almost confined to a room in his mansion and lives in fear of his wife Vanessa. Vanessa, you see, wants to have a baby and although its clear to anyone that Marc isn't on board with this and is living like a battered husband (hiding from his wife)-- both Juno, Vanessa, and the movie get upset when he dares say what he wants (which isn't want Juno and Vanessa want) and goes for it. They say things like *grow up* but Marc is the only grown up and proves it by standing up and leaving his sham of a marriage before adopting a baby. Vanessa struck me as very shallow and perhaps married Marc not for love, but to have baby. Yet the movie makes Marc the bad guy. It seems apparent that Vanessa knows the marriage is in trouble but will put up with it for fear she won't get a baby without a husband. Juno knows too but wants her child to have the perfect family.     Then Juno's behavior toward her boyfriend is horrible. First she tell him she is getting an abortion and then she barely talks to him. Finally when he asks someone to the prom, she gets jealous and says she is in love with him. That is how the movie ends -- they are so *in love* but please as Marc says at one point in this move to Juno... \\"you are so young.\\" It is hard for an adult viewer to get the all warm and fuzzies about Juno's love discovery. You get the feeling that if her boyfriend (and father of her son) tells her he likes band X -- the relationship will be over.     Mostly it was a boring 90 minutes. I guess someone in Hollywood who is powerful must have produced this movie because it is not good. To even compare it to election... I don't get it. There is nothing witty, funny, or smart here.
074329503X|5.0|Rarely does a personal tale grip the reader as this one does many women--myself included. There for the grace of the luck of an accident of birth, could be me--or you. Caged. Locked into a cage, with no key available to release the power within.<br />Ayaan is the woman whose co-production with Theo van Gogh, resulted in his vicious murder. The production, \\"Submission\\" is available on youtube--a rather tame 11 min. film detailing this one person's perspective. It is only a snippet of what Ayaan has to say about the importance of education for all women--the empowerment of societies through the power of all people.<br /><br />As women go about life--leaving the house without asking permission of another, making decisions without having to ask a man, May I--remember, that living in a cage could have happened to you. To me. To any of us.<br /><br />Must read for any woman, anywhere. Anytime.
1591841984|5.0|If you're interesting in knowing more about how Steve Jobs has been managing Apple or Pixar, this book is for you!    This book is NOT about Steve's crazy, nasty habits like always parking in handicapped spaces (although the book does mention some of his excesses). As a matter of fact, the author is a bit biased about Apple, but that doesn't impact on the reading (it's not like he tries to hide Steve's flaws either).    This book is about how has Steve's personality had an impact on Apple's culture. How did he manage to orchestrate Apple's turnaround when he came back in 1997. How does he unleash innovation at Apple.    As an added bonus the book contains a lot of tidbits about Apple / Pixar / NeXT history.    A great read!
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin is the greatest rock band of all time and this may be their greatest album.  It is very near the pinnacle of rock music.  Buy it and enjoy.
0375701427|5.0|The pivotal events of American Pastoral occur during the Vietnam protest era, and center around the self-effacing protagonist, Swede Levov, a happily married, loving father and husband, and conscientious, highly principled businessman.  Their daughter and only child is the central delight of her prosperous, happy parents until, at age sixteen, she falls in with a group of violent antiwar protesters, and bombs the town post office, killing a beloved local doctor and permanently shattering the lives of her family.  But if, at this juncture, we expect Roth to strip away the glossy surfaces to reveal dark family secrets, we are mistaken.  The Levovs are responsible, loving, unselfish, and attentive parents who provide their child an ideal blend of reason and discipline and who offer her a secure, happy, and useful childhood on their dairy farm in an idyllic New Jersey exurb.  Roth forces us to take a nearly unbearable and uncomprehending look at caring, enlightened parents who unwittingly feed their child's monstrosity, and who face unearned destruction in spite of all their careful precautions.     If much modern work is concerned with dysfunctional families, it is illuminating, if disquieting, to read about catastrophe in a high-functioning one.  Roth credibly presents the Levovs' essential goodness with compassion and thought-provoking insight.  The disaster appears random, and some of the book's most heartbreaking moments concern Swede's fruitless attempts to figure out how he might have averted the tragedy.  American Pastoral is new territory for Roth, and if you have never previously been a fan of his, it would be worthwhile to give him another chance.  This emotionally shattering, powerful book bears comparison with the now-classic Sophie's Choice by William Styron, or going back even further, to Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment.  If you are looking for a worthwhile read that will haunt you, live inside your mind, and wrench you free of smug assumptions, then do not miss this significant, and paradoxically life-affirming book.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Beware! The DVD comes in a crummy paper sleeve likely to scratch the disc itself. What was Paramount thinking? My guess is they weren't. Wait for a properly packaged edition with some real extra features.
0684865130|2.0|Catch-22 consisted of alot of irony and witty sarcasm, and held ideas that seem unrealistic yet comical and incredibly unexpected. I found it understandable that character Yossarian wants to get home without having to die in order to do it, and the other numerous characters and situations made it even more comical and twists the ideas and sarcasm, making it truly unique. But as entertaining as it was I also found it somewhat redundant; the situations and predicaments certain characters were stuck in kept it interesting, but in my opinion there wasn't really a plot. It would jump around to different moments in time unexpectedly and the end of the book was so unexpected and disappointing, it makes the book as a whole seem superfluous.    Irony was a large aspect of the book; practically every situation any character got into was totally ironic, and I think Joseph Heller's use of irony brings out more of the anti-war opinion the book seems to have. It seems like Heller meant for the ideas and situations to be superfluous in order to show that war is superfluous, and I think he portrayed it well in the book. The tools he used to get that point across-- irony, sarcasm, comedy-- I believe were crucial to the ideas and themes, but I also think that seeing it from Yossarian's point of view is crucial as well, and brings out more of Heller's opinions throughout the book.    A good aspect (and one of the very, very few) I found about the book was the fact that it wasn't based on pre-conceived notions of war but based on Heller's own opinion. Heller wrote the book the way he saw war, in a way where it seemed so twisted and unrealistic that it couldn't be reality but in my opinion it was reality. Every situation seemed unbelievable, but I think war in itself must be unbelievable and that was Heller's opinion...it was ridiculous, unbelievable, something one couldn't describe using everyday circumstances. It made all the main ideas stronger and circulated them throughout one another and throughout the book, but that was probably the only good thing about the book. I thought the whole thing was incredibly unnecessary with the way it ended and it was too repetitive with simply describing characters for each chapter; it made it kind of dull.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|Another great album from AFI! I seriously do not think it's possible for AFI to make bad music. I love the way they've progressed in this album. They have a quality to their music that is consistent, yet always new.     As for people who say they've sold out? Just because someone has a song on MTV (and I don't watch MTV) doesn't mean it's a bad song! AFI couldn't be kept a secret (from main stream) forever. They're too good of a band. I think they're music is artistic, in depth and very genuine. But I suppose people who don't like how they've changed- only listen to one genre of music.     Davey Havok has a beautiful voice.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|I've heard the audio of the original Celtic Woman and the Christmas CD, but this is the first video.  Wow!<br /><br />My favorite vocalist was Hayley, though I also like Chloe and Meav.  And what can I say about Mairead?  She is a joy to watch, even on more solemn moments like when she accompanied Hayley on \\"Lascia Chio Pianga\\".  But one highlight for me was Lisa's singing \\"The Voice\\", rivaling \\"Orinico Flow\\" as my favorite cut.  I also enjoyed \\"The Prayer\\", \\"Scarborough Fair\\", the wonderful aca pella arrangement of \\"Over The Rainbow\\", \\"Lascia Chio Pianga\\", \\"Spanish Lady\\", \\"Somewhere\\", and \\"You Raise Me Up\\".
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you like the movie, I'd suggest buying it to anyone.  It's more awesome every time I watch it!
B000UZ4EP2|5.0|This project is nice and relaxing.  My favorite tracks were \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"No One Talks\\", \\"I Will Find You\\", \\"Always\\", \\"Hear My Prayer\\", \\"Many Faces\\", and \\"Gone Are The Days\\", and especially \\"Merry Go Round\\".  That song has taken up residence in my brain, coming to mind on occassion.
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is the best CD I've purchased in a while.  It has all the music from the movie.  Even if you haven't seen the movie, the music is amazing and very worth listening to.  Even if you're having doubts...buy it!  The music captures the emotions and awesome story of the movie.
B000YAFJYS|3.0|During the opening scene in Persepolis we see a taxi approaching Orly Airport in Paris and the air-traffic control tower rears priapically over the terminal building like - well, like a minaret over a mosque - and briefly I thought I might be in for a bit of a treat: a challenging comparison of the unspoken (and hypocritical) political oppression of the West seen through the prism of a refugee from another authoritarian state.<br /><br />No such luck. I suspect the resemblance to a minaret was coincedental, for what then proceeded was a nicely executed, slickly produced, but fundamentally uninteresting account of what should have been a fascinating story.<br /><br />I couldn't help but compare this story - oppressed muslim girl gets out, goes to Europe, struggles with the freedoms of the West - with that of Ayan Hirsi in Infidel and The Caged Virgin, which was altogether more shocking, enlightening, challenging and uplifting.<br /><br />As a result I sat quietly, enjoying the imaginative graphics and particularly the soundtrack, but wondering when the point was going to reveal itself. As the credits rolled (their sudden arrival came as quite a surprise) it still hadn't, and even as I sit here hours later I remain mystified as to why all the effort, all the interesting (if somewhat hackneyed leftie) political and historical backdrop, to provide a backdrop for a pretty unremarkable personal story.<br /><br />Olly Buxton

B000099T2L|3.0|Great first 3 SINGLES & everything else is just AVERAGE!<br /><br />Beyonce is one of the few artist in R&B that seems to have striked an addiction with fans around the world. She is also one of the few acts where i feel people will run out to buy her CD even if your not a huge R&B fan. I do find her as a SINGER to be very interesting and i like her voice and ENERGY. But i dont like her during interviews because she talks really slow and sometimes so SLOW that she actually makes the interviewer forget what question he initially asked her. That's how long it takes her to answer questions on live TV interviews. She is so powerful at answering slow that she can literally throw you off of track from the main topic. WOW!! With that being said i like her as an artist and she has a fascinating & powerful voice. Crazy In Love is beyond ADDICTIVE when it was 1st released and still is to this day when you hear it. With beats & lyrics like that how can you not want to dance? To top off her successful solo debut her 2nd & 3rd singles were amazing. But that was it!!! Every other song on the album is a DUD! I didnt expect a stellar album but she's a commercial artist so i expected atleast 5 good songs on this album. But only 3 were worthy of being mentioned. 3 stars for 3 great singles and nothing else.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I was completely enraptured with this movie right from the beginning.  It is very dark and moody - just exactly how it should be!  The acting is wonderful, the music is fantastic, the costumes are gorgeous...I loved everything about this movie.  I saw it first on Masterpiece Theater, but just had to have my own copy to watch again and again.
B000000WFF|2.0|Spiceworld by Spice Girls is a predictable album and after this album was released I stopped being a fan. The songs are weak and formulatic, this is the final time we hear Geri Halliwell, she left the group a year after the release of this album. Songs like Spice Up Your Life, Too Much, Viva Forever, and Stop have no flavor or edge to them, their debut album was ten times better than Spiceworld. This album is a stinker and even those euro babes knew it too.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|I just recently watched \\"Sunshine\\" on DVD and didn't know what to immediately expect. I like Danny Boyle's previous work so I knew that carried a little weight when deciding whether to pick it up.<br /><br />I won't go so far and say I'm a sci-fi \\"geek\\". I do like sci-fi up to a certain point. I love \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\". I love \\"Event Horizon\\". Hell, I can even put up with \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" if I have enough LSD running through my veins. So explaining that and knowing that I don't have a degree in science fiction physics (as apparently some of the fanboys here do), I can honestly say my disbelief was suspended and I enjoyed the reasons the crew of the Icarus II had for journeying to the sun.<br /><br />\\"Sunshine\\" does not build up with pre-launch shots of them back on Earth. Instead, a soothing voice tells us that the earth is freezing and what the crew's mission is. Good enough for government work I say! While the characters do lack a bit of flesh (figuratively), it still does not detract from the fact that I latched on to a couple and was disappointed when they were killed.<br /><br />I did enjoy \\"Sunshine\\" and I would recommend seeing it despite the flaws. It's pretty to look at, creates a great since of claustrophobia laced with a sense of awe at the raw power of the sun, and builds upon deep seated fears humans have about life and death.<br /><br />EDIT: I've edited this review to remove specific spoilers.
1878424505|5.0|This book is a good read.  The four agreements are very, very useful for anyone.  There is a spiritual underlying theme, but if you are not religious, like I am not....just take the jewels from the book and disregard the rest.    I strongly recommend this book to everyone.  I believe, everyone and I mean everyone in the world should read this book.  If everyone did the  four agreements, there would be a lot less conflict in the world.
B0014KD46W|4.0|This is a great Steve Winwood CD, but all the background musicians are fantastic as well, percussion, flute, sax, bass.  Everyone on the CD does a wonderful job.  Several songs remind you of Blindfaith and other songs blend jazz with rock very well.  A definite 4 star CD with Grammy potential.
B000YABIQ6|2.0|Some interesting writing and acting ruined by use of the tobacco and alcohol drugs. Just as the movies are FINALLY starting to clean up their act with these drugs, this series comes along and almost tries to glorify them. Both drugs are weapons of mass destruction, especially tobacco. I'm sure the tobacco and alcohol pushers are happy with this series!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I originally didn't think that the rumble would be that big of a deal until I didn't have it.  I found myself leaning towards games for my Xbox 360 but now... in the last few days I have purchased 4 games for my PS3 including Grand Theft Auto IV and the new Dualshock Sixaxis is great.  It really adds a dimension of gameplay that is so visceral.      Right now I am playing Grand Theft Auto IV and the game is so amazing.  I am also playing Condemne2: Bloodshot and the rumble adds a lot of depth to the gameplay.  I really didn't think that I missed the rumble that much.  But having it back again reminds me how integral it really can be to true gameplay immersion.     Get on Amazon and by this thing... you won't regret it.
1400049628|5.0|The greatest of truths are told in a joke!...I like survival horror movies, videogames,...anything that shows, dare I say it, the living human organism fighting to remain in existence.  This book was reviewed by many as a laugh out loud comedy and it could be taken as such and in the same breath, this manual has some sound advice all around.  When I want to laugh I will look at Day of the Dead and wonder why they did not have a copy of this and if somthing as horrific as corpses walking the earth trying to eat the living ever happens then this book will be the most valuable piece of literature on the planet, hopefully before it is too late.  Worth every penny! All horror fans should get this book!  I highly recommend it!!
0143034901|5.0|I had not read any reviews when I decided to check out 'The Shadow of the Wind' from the library. What attracted me to the book was its very unique cover featuring an ominous looking man in a foggy street of Barcelona (hardcover version). However, once I started reading the book, I could not put it down.<br /><br />From the moment Zafon mentions the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, I was glued to the book. The plot is a good one and Zafon is masterful at creating a good tone and pace for the book as the reader follows Daniel Sempere as he discovers a copy of 'The Shadow of the Wind' in the Cemetery of Forgotten Books and decides to learn more about its author, Julian Carax. Along the way he encounters a range of interesting characters from the eccentric but loyal Fermin Romero de Torres to the sadistic and evil Francisco Javier Fumero. These characters and the setting of Barcelona, which I know quite well, for me, made this book very enjoyable.<br /><br />From start to finish Zafon will keep your attention. I never thought he overdid certain parts of the story: everything was well-balanced and each segment of the novel played an important role in helping the reader learn more about 'The Shadow of the Wind.'<br /><br />I have a feeling Hollywood might make a movie out of this book, and I will probably see it. But I know that no matter who they get for the movie, it will simply not compare to the book.<br /><br />As summer approaches, I recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining and captivating read.

B0010358CG|5.0|It seems that people either love or hate this revived anime franchise.  I for one, find myself drawn into its post-apocalyptic world of technological marvels and complex political struggles.  The emotional side of this film is much more developed than in the previous installment.  The characters' personalities and flaws are explored on a deeper and more satisfying level.  But not to worry fellow action buffs, there are still plenty of genre-defining fight sequences that take full advantage of the innovative computer assisted graphics.  The influence of the inclusion of legendary director John Woo on the project makes itself apparent in scenes of gun-slinging glory.  Anime fans, show this one to your non-believer friends for a sure convert.  The attention to detail and sophisticated graphic rendering should help displace that \\"cartoons-are-for-kids\\" mentality.  All-in-all, Ex Machina is a welcome amendment to the series.
B000VBIEXS|4.0|Update April 18, 2014.n<br /><br />Alright guys, I gave Brain Salad Surgery another listen.  This time a much closer listen late at night under the right setting with an open mind and no outside distractions *ahem* like awful windy cold weather *ahem* ... and now I enjoy it!  While I do strongly believe the band is showing off (at least on side two) I really do enjoy the instrumental passages enough to recommend the album, and enough to appreciate the experience a LOT better now.<br /><br />Still not in the same league as the classical-inspired superior stuff that the band has done elsewhere, but memorable enough.  There's not really a boring moment anywhere in fact.  The only requirement on the listeners part is to adjust to what sounds like a far-fetched stage show performed in hyper mode.  The band's still quite clearly showing off in a highly exaggerated borderline annoying kind of way instead of their usual emotion-building, pure, honest and easier to absorb kind of way throughout the entirety of side two but again, under the right setting I don't really mind.<br /><br />Unfortunately I still have mixed feelings with the talk-singing type of vocal melodies presented on the \\"Karn Evil\\" suite.  \\"Welcome back my friends to the show that never ends, we're so glad you could attend come inside come inside\\".  Talking or singing here?  But hey the vocals are a short insignificant part of a much greater adventurous type of progressive rock, now I get it, so ignoring the brief points when the vocals appear is becoming easier and easier with every listen.<br /><br />Oh and I should have mentioned the first time around that side one has VERY beautiful and powerful Greg Lake vocals on the shorter tunes along with more topnotch jamming on \\"Toccata\\".  Here's my original review where I gave the album 3 stars at first (now 4 stars out of 5).  I'll leave it up for you to read.<br /><br />To me, Brain Salad Surgery isn't as much of a classic compared to the previous ELP offerings.<br /><br />While there's many keyboard passages that are highly memorable, along with some of Greg Lake's famous angelic vocals, for the most part the album doesn't flow as beautifully as other ELP albums.  More often than not, the band seems to turn obnoxious with their musical ideas, and it does begin to wear thin on the listener after several minutes go by.<br /><br />Greg Lake is such a gifted singer and it's a shame he wasn't given more time in the spotlight.  The entire album has a much different atmosphere from the other ELP albums.  This album feels more like a stage show or something.  The previous ELP albums felt more like an adventure through heaven with their classical influences.<br /><br />Well, it's up to you whether you want to purchase this album or not.  Sometimes most popular doesn't equal best.  This is a perfect example of that.  My favorite song is \\"Still You Turn Me On\\" with its soft pleasant vocals.  I DO enjoy many of the keyboard jams as well, but in my opinion, they don't flow together very well.  You just get the impression the band members are showing off their talents on this one.
B00133KFGW|4.0|This was a great movie... that is, if you like movies that fall into your comfort zones.  And I do... sometimes.  To be honest, I'm generally more a fan of action, horror, teen comedy, etc.  So \\"August Rush\\" does not fit into my ideal of a good movie (and, for examples, I consider movies like The Dark Knight, Blade, Underworld, Oh Brother Where Art Thou, Friday the 13th, and American Pie great movies).  However, this movie was good as far as being a feel-good movie.  I have been stressed out, sick, and just generally sad over the past couple months, so this movie helped to lift my spirits quite a bit.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is unrealistic and the plot depends wholly and completely on tons of deux et machinas.  Everything that happens just happens.  The father of the boy is never actually told that he is Evan's (August) father.  And until that concert in the park, the boy doesn't know that either of them are his parents, and yet he does know (what?).  The timeline of 11 years also does not help to make it realistic.<br /><br />What this movie is trying to get across is that the boy is drawn by the music.  As a musician myself, I can relate to this sentiment.  It is true that music is out there, everywhere, and it controls those of us who listen.  The following line from Led Zeppelin's \\"Houses of the Holy\\" says it best:<br />\\"Let the music be your master.  Will you heed the master's call?\\"<br />That is the idea this movie tried to get across, and it's effort was good, if rushed and unbelievable.<br /><br />Finally, I think this would have been much better as a novel.  At least, as a novel, there'd be much more room to explain much of what seemed like well-planned coincidences and serious and obvious deux et machinas.<br /><br />So why do I give this movie 4 stars?  Because it is uplifting, helped me feel better, and it is a Comfort-Zone Bullseye.
B00003CXBK|5.0|this movie is a classic. the animation is spectacular and the story very well done. I happen to be somewhat into japanese culture as of present, but before i was so into it, and people who i know now who are not into it, sometimes japanese media goes over their heads. the cultures are kind of different and place importance on different things and when a person used to seeing one kind of story or moral repeated over and over in different ways sees something else... well they may not immediately appreciate it (an example of this would be how at the end he doesn't end up with the girl. this happens in almost every western movie because we are very focused on the 'happy ending' fairytale, validating the storyline with the 'kiss at the end', but that doesn't happen in all cultures). however, i found princess mononoke to somewhat transcend this confusion, because the story is so relatable and well told. i found it to be so when i first watched it, which would be late elementary school, and feel this way even more now.<br /><br />the story can be translated in many ways, but the general message i got out of it was the modern attempting to erase tradition. the people of iron town worked hard to destroy the forest because by doing so they could earn a living in the new world making iron. the only way they could do this however was to cut down the forests, which meant that they would have to kill the gods from the old world, who were already dying out. the thing is that the lady osono (or whatever) is painted in something of a bad light as she is cutting down the forest and killing the gods, but she is an amazingly strong humanist and a proactive woman in a time and place where women weren't liable to have that status (the status might help to paint her as a 'bad guy' however, because even though we are making progressions, many people are still very sexist... i would bet you that if not you yourself, someone you know thinks that women are by nature evil or devious... in 2008). So when looking at it in this light osono is opting for humanity. she takes in those lepers, she saves brothel workers from whatever fate they would face in brothels, etc. and yet she's the bad guy. interesting to note at any rate.<br /><br />ashitaka is a great protagonist. a pacifist to the end. he goes on his journey to find something to remove his curse, not for selfish reasons i don't think, but to right the wrong. he's a pretty selfless person. at the beginning of the movie, the reason he got the curse was because his sister was in the way of the boar, so he had to shoot it, but before that he was trying to talk to it. this is basically how he acts throughout the movie. he tries to get things done without violence, but if it comes to it, he will resort to violence to protect himself or those he cares about.<br /><br /> didn't really notice the environmental message when i first saw it. i was more focused on cultural loss. but recently, with the environmental bludgeon the media has been playing around with, i noticed just how 'for nature' this movie was. traditionalism would of course take the stance against industry which would be a way to save the forest, so it makes sense, but i guess i just went into it too symbolically. it does have a pleasant environmental message however, better than a lot of other animated environmental movies.<br /><br />so, to sum up, this is a great movie.hen looking at it in this light osono is opting for humanity. she takes in those lepers, she saves brothel workers from whatever fate they would face in brothels, etc. and yet she's the bad guy. interesting to note at any rate.     ashitaka is a great protagonist. a pacifist to the end. he goes on his journey to find something to remove his curse, not for selfish reasons i don't think, but to right the wrong. he's a pretty selfless person. at the beginning of the movie, the reason he got the curse was because his sister was in the way of the boar, so he had to shoot it, but before that he was trying to talk to it. this is basically how he acts throughout the movie. he tries to get things done without violence, but if it comes to it, he will resort to violence to protect himself or those he cares about.      didn't really notice the environmental message when i first saw it. i was more focused on cultural loss. but recently, with the environmental bludgeon the media has been playing around with, i noticed just how 'for nature' this movie was. traditionalism would of course take the stance against industry which would be a way to save the forest, so it makes sense, but i guess i just went into it too symbolically. it does have a pleasant environmental message however, better than a lot of other animated environmental movies.     so, to sum up, this is a great movie.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I loved everything about this movie:  The music, the backdrop, the acting (I'm not a fan of George Clooney, especially after he ruined Batman, but his acting here is phenomenal, IMO), the script, the humor, the plot... everything is perfect.<br /><br />It is, basically, an updated version of Homer's Odyssey, but it also contains more then enough differences to be completely separate from Homer's Odyssey, the main one being that the movie has nothing Supernatural about it (except maybe \\"The Devil,\\" but then even he was human).<br /><br />There is nothing about this movie I didn't like, and that is why it gets the honor of being my all-time favorite movie.
1853104825|2.0|The book has its interesting parts.<br /><br />Though be aware of the anti male sentiment that revolves through out the piece, it appears that the author was a co-pilot at one time and carries a rather large chip about the past.<br /><br />I am a 36 year actively flying Commercial pilot and do not see the (specifically male issues) that this portrays to be true.<br /><br />Other than that it is a relatively good read.<br /><br />Though there are many many other books written without the bitterness that truly give the facts.<br /><br />Gary
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I am a huge Madonna fan. I am so disappointed Madonna felt she needed to include rappers and Justin Timberlake in her songs. WHY!? Not only that, the songs are just boring, 4 minutes - which is played in the clubs all the time for some reason- is one of the most ridiculous songs I've ever heard, and it hurts to listen to. If you're hoping for anothe Ray of Light, Music  or Confessions you will be very disappointed. Oh well, maybe in 2 more years she'll come out with another great dance album. After all, she came out with American Life, and then a couple years later came out with Confessions, which was one of her best albums.
B0011NVC9I|3.0|Beowulf is a great [[ASIN:0393975800 story]], it would not have lasted over thousand years if it wasn't.  This 2007 all CGI version deviates considerably from the original story's truest and perhaps even its most enduring elements.  The villain Grendel is portrayed as if we have the opportunity to sympathize with him.  I remember upon his first attack in this film thinking that the Grendel from the epic poem would never have been so bold as to attack while his enemies were not asleep.  Never would he come face to face with King Hrothgar on his throne.  He is a cowardly and vile monster.  I also remember studying Beowulf and thinking that this is the ultimate pagan hero.  Courageous even if to a fault, boisterously politicizing himself to the gods by listing off each of his own unearthly tasks, challenging any evil no matter what it may be, even if it looks exactly like a naked Angelina Jolie.  Most of all, he was to be a shining example of pride and honesty.  It's funny, until now I never realized how I may have idolized Beowulf during my High School readings but just like those young pagan lads a thousand years ago listening to tales of the great warrior around a giant bonfire, I guess in a way I did and still do.  The Beowulf we get here is tricked and tormented and his time as king is essentially based on deception.  He is flawed in ways that make him less a hero.<br /><br />There is something to admire in that fearless definition of heroism held up high in the original tale.  Something even more endearing about this ultimate clash between good and evil.  Something got lost in the transition from ancient Anglo-Saxon scribes to the capable pens of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, who wrote the solid but fundamentally flawed screenplay.  Their writing makes for a great popcorn movie but I'm quite sure English scholars are not so impressed.  In fact, this will definitely not and should not be shown by teachers or professors to compliment the study of this epic poem.<br /><br />Still, Beowulf as a film is a back-to-back feast for the eyes.  It is a beautiful film and I also believe its style to be a worthy standard to uphold for other action filmmakers in the years to come.  I was worried right off that bat that Beowulf would be a two-hour video game cut scene, but it manages to transcend that judgement with time.  The characters may be quasi-cartoon but they still hold more spirit than many cartoons have the ability to by far.  Ray Winstone is Beowulf and his demeanor is nearly perfect.  Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, as Hrothgar and Unferth respectively, both shine through their computerized characters more than enough.  Both actors bring the overall performances in this film to attention, as both are just that good at their craft.  Crispin Glover manages Grendel fantastically and the Grendel here is quite visually satisfying considering I've never had a strong enough imagination to picture Grendel myself based on the descriptions in literature.  Angelina Jolie is certainly good enough for her role, as flawed as it may be.  Grendel's mother is actually the character changed most of all, but as a separate villain from the epic poem, the character is not only crucial to Gaiman and Avery's story, but actually quite effective.  Oh yes, and what epic film with bearded warriors would be complete without everyone's favorite brute from the early middle ages, Brendan Gleeson (as Wiglaf)?!<br /><br />Overall, it is a tribute in some ways to the great story but on the other hand the way it sacrifices the purity of its characters just to create a convenient story, a gripping visual style, and a well-packaged blockbuster troubles me enough to only give a slight recommendation.  Also, wait for this on blu-ray if you want it (if it ever comes in that format), I really can't see any reason not to unless you need it right away.

B00008CLNQ|3.0|There are two readily available two CD sets from DG recording Herbert Von Karajan conducting Brahms four symphonies. The recordings on this CD feature clean digital recording for the first three symphonies, but an earlier recording for the 4th. The performances in this set are clean and competent but nothing special. The slower movements border on boring. These would represent acceptable versions of Brahms' symphonies in a classical music collection, but the early recording sold as \\"Brahms: The Complete Symphonies\\" is far superior and is my choice for the best complete set of Brahms symphonies. The recordings are clear and well-engineered despite being ADD. The performances are far more lively.     Do yourself a favor and check out the other version. Chances are you'll find a reference to it as one of the other recordings shown on this page. The preferred version is DG catalog # 289 453 097-2.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is the real deal, numero uno, number one, the absolute best, period.    While many classic albums of the late 60's and early 70's might be showing their age, \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" is just as fresh and demanding as it was when first released in 1972. From Keith Richard's power chords signaling the beginning of \\"Rocks Off\\" to the frantic loud and raucous guitar fade of \\"Soul Survivor\\" Mick, Keith, Charlie, and the boys go for the throat on the Stones most powerful album. The Stones employ all their influences at their best: blues, gospel, country, R&B, and good old garage band rock n roll. The Stones love Chuck Berry, check out \\"Rip This Joint.\\" Next, try some Slim Harpo blues, \\"Shake Your Hips.\\"  If you don't feel totally greased up by now, then get ready for \\"Casino Boogie\\" with Keith and Mick Taylor trading guitar licks sounding like screeching alley cats with Charlie Watts playing a naughty strip tease rhythm on the drums. What would be the end of side one on the LP ends with the great classic hit, \\"Tumblin' Dice.\\"     \\"Exile on Main Street\\" is a loosely structured concept album, in essence the Stones' journey through America. Thus side two, take the listener on a little spin out in the sticks with \\"Sweet Virginia\\" where you'd better be ready to scrape the sh## right off your shoes. For another stab at country music in much the same trippy mood as Gram Parson's \\"New Soft Shoe\\" comes \\"Torn and Frayed\\" the kind of song George Jones or Merle Haggard could only dream of. \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" brings in a little island music sound with its gentle marimbas. Finally, side two ends with the powerful country ballad with Nicky Hopkins, whose piano mastery can be heard on almost every cut on the album, pounding out one of his best piano leads on any Stones album with \\"Loving Cup.\\" Side three opens with Keith Richards' most familiar song, \\"Happy.\\" From there the Stones turn in one of their sleaziest, grungiest, most menacing tunes ever where Keith locks them in a manic rhythm that never lets up from start to finish, guitars and piano playing in total sync as Mick belts out some of the Stones' most mysonistic lyrics ever with \\"Turd on the Run.\\" \\"Ventilator Blues\\" is a show case for Mick Taylor's fine slide guitar playing. The next number, \\"Just Want to See His Face\\" is perhaps the oddest song on the album. It sounds like something coming across an old AM radio late at night from an African American southern church service. The rhythms are captivating. Side three ends with the album's most powerful ballad with some killer horn and vocal arrangements, \\"Let It Loose.\\" After working the listener into an emotional frenzy with that tune, now it's time to start down the album's home stretch with one of the Stones' great concert rockers, \\"All Down the Line\\" with some of the most creative hooks the Stones have ever stuck in one of their straight ahead rockers. \\"Stop Breakin' Down\\" is the second cover of a blues classic on the album. Is it any wonder to this day the old blues masters still perform with Mick and the boys? \\"Shine A Light\\" is a glorious spiritual masterpiece with lovely gospel piano and organ provided by Billy Preston and two of the most memorable guitar solos ever performed in a Stones classic. Finishing up in a mad frenzy on what was a full two album set is \\"Soul Surivor\\" a tune that starts off hot and keeps getting faster, louder, and nastier as the song continues. Somehow the way the guitars keep chiming into a fade at the end gives the listener the idea that the journey continues long after the album stops playing.    It's muddy, it's dirty, but after the 1994 remaster, American listeners finally get to hear the Stones best album in its full glory. The American LP pressings were horrible, tinny and shrill with so much of the details and subtlties missing in action. The CBS release of the first CD was absolutely horrible. Did anybody do any premastering planning? The European record albums were beautiful and the 1994 CD finally gives the listener a chance to hear all the details in the massive wall of sound without compromising the rough and rowdy sound that the album strives so hard to maintain.     There's so much going on with every song. After all these years, it's still growing on me. I've worn out five LP's and two CD's enjoying this album.    No rock music collection is legit without this album, period. Play it as loud as you can handle it.

B00005JPS7|4.0|Jon Favreau ([[ASIN:B00006ADFY Swingers ]] and [[ASIN:B0002F6BRE Elf]]) effectively directs the screen adaptation for the comic book superhero Iron Man.  Favreau has some fine-tuning ahead of him in terms of directing action films but Iron Man is still among the very best comic book character based films so far.  It is about as entertaining as you can get and the few flaws that are present are almost entirely forgivable due to Favreau's knack for developing characters and also understating drama effectively.  It might be important to note that it is hard to contain myself and write an honest review, because in all of my years of reading comics, Iron Man, along with perhaps the Silver Surfer, is my favorite comic book character of them all.  Fortunately for me, unlike last year's [[ASIN:B000VNMMPW Fantastic Four sequel]], this particular film truly delivers in terms of satisfying the little long lost comic book geek-boy dwelling in my brain.  There were actually moments during the film that I looked over to my brother in full wide-eyed geek-mode and said things like \\"that stands for S.H.I.E.L.D.!\\"  The kid in me absolutely loved this movie.<br /><br />Iron Man, for the uninitiated, is really Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), Chief Executive Officer of weapons manufacturing giant Stark Industries (think Lockheed Martin run by Donald Trump).  He is an arrogant womanizing alcoholic who just happens to be an MIT graduate and a technical genius unlike no other man of his time.  It is as if Leonardo Da Vinci was sent into a time machine, given a mansion, several bottles Johnny Walker Blue, and no reason not to celebrate his lust for women.  In other words, this is not Superman.  Stark is flawed and Favreau so graciously provides us an opportunity to watch him grow as a man and as a machine in his ever-evolving nearly indestructible self-made super armor.  In the beginning, Stark is captured by terrorists in Afghanistan and unbeknownst to his enemies, he is shown the error of his ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.  A new man with new motives, Stark develops his suit further and becomes an unlikely but befitting hero.  Look out terrorists and look weapons manufacturers, including you Iron Monger!  I only wish he could've cleaned up that ugliness in Iraq on his way home.<br /><br />One can tell by the promotions that the special effects are great and they are amazing from beginning to end.  However, the screenplay is very solid, especially the humorous, fast, and witty dialogue for Robert Downey, Jr.  The chemistry between Stark and his loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow) works remarkably well and far better than I would've expected.  Jeff Bridges is also great as the villain Obidiah Stane and the rest of the cast is solid all around, with the exception of perhaps Terrence Howard he unfortunately seems to be going through the motions here.  But overall, the magic of this film is the casting of Robert Downey, Jr. in the lead role.  He is perfect for the role in almost every way.  Somehow he gives us a hero we feel compelled to find a reason to root for despite his flaws.  I'm not sure another actor could've pulled it off.<br /><br />This definitely receives a high recommendation from me for pretty much anyone looking for a fun and compelling action movie.  For fellow lovers of the Iron Man comics and other crossover stories (i.e. Avengers, S.H.I.E.L.D.); do yourself a favor and stay until the credits are done rolling, you won't regret it.ways as a weapons manufacturer and begins building his suit as a way to escape his kidnappers.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|I'm listening to this CD again, for the third time, after letting the first two listenings sink in a little bit.  Each time it becomes progressively easier, but I'm fairly certain this is not going to be a disc that stays in my CD player for long at a time.<br /><br />At its best, Portishead can take a variety of disparate noises and turn that raw material into listenable, catchy music.  There are a few songs on this CD that reach that height, but many of these tracks are (unfortunately) wandering, directionless, not-entirely-melodious sound experimentation.<br /><br />Now, having said that, the experiementation they do is really cool.  This band is made up of masters of aural design.  There are no wasted tones (although I do find myself missing the scratching a little bit, heh), no overtly wrong choices.  Everything on here is interesting to listen to, and it demands that you pay full attention to it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Kudos to Portishead.  I really appreciate the artfulness of this CD.  But it's sort of too bad.  After 11 years, I really wanted to ENJOY it.

159562015X|1.0|Total waste of time. Many/most of the \\"strengths\\" they list are contradictory, overlapping or basically unscientific. To determine 39 separate values in a 20 minute test is impossible, and you end up with a mishmash of vague descriptions that in some way could apply to anybody. It got my top strength right on - but then, I could have told you what that strength was. The other four were vaguely worded and not descriptive.

0446677450|1.0|I was assigned to read this book for a class, and while it does make you think about money and how you will prepare for the future, that is about where the positive attributes end.<br /><br />The book overall feels like more of an inspirational speech than an educational supplement.  The lack of fact and teaching makes the advice to invest in real estate and start up companies quite insane, as these are both very good ways to lose a lot of money very fast, and Kiyosaki seems completely blind to that aspect of things, stopping short by acknowledging that \\"more is learned from failure than success\\" and then failing to give any negative examples throughout the entire book (I mean if every real estate investment turned into an $80,000 profit in less than a month, don't you think more people would be on that?).<br /><br />On top of that you have the masturbatory title that makes it sound like there is a grand secret poor parents don't know, when in interviews, Kiyosaki has all but confirmed \\"rich dad\\" to be a figure from his imagination.<br /><br />The only REAL advice gathered from this book is to spend within your means and start preparing for the future early (as the most powerful factor of any investment is time), but honestly... who didn't know that?<br /><br />This book should be avoided in favor of a text that actually imparts knowledge unto the reader, instead of a bundle of feel good financial fiction.

B000PDYVVG|2.0|I had to read this book for a book club and immediately hated it.  It begins with a woman who is so self-righteous that she has the nerve to say that she divorces her husband because she doesn't want to be married anymore.  She goes on to say that she needs a break from life and needs to go to Italy, India and Indonesia.    The Italy section was interesting.  She talked a lot about the country and living there.  India was the most awful thing I have ever read in my life.  I literally skipped half of the section.  What possessed her to spend a third of the book talking about meditating and her mantra?  And then Indonesia was not quite as bad as India.      The thing that really got me about this book is that she spent the whole time getting over her husband and boyfriend.  This book reeked of feminine power and claims of not needing a man to live a happy life.  And at the end, she meets a guy!!!  Excuse me???  I don't care if it happened in real life, don't include meeting a man in your book about how independent you are!  And the next book is all about her wedding.  If I didn't hate her before, now she really ticks me off.    Please, do not read this book!

This is feel good music, it sounds like Fleetwood Mac on Easter Sunday.  They album is a production miracle and Dylan's obvious love for Christ is contagious.  There has never been a better modern example of religious music set to modern rock instrumentation.  This is the secret development of Dylan's career that may never be articulated in public.

The Black Dahlia Murder are without question one of the finest melodic death metal bands out here in the United States today. &#34;Nocturnal&#34; is without question their most brutal, evil, gory, and their best album thus far, and it's also one of the best death metal albums of 2007 as well. I enjoyed BDM's previous effort from 2005 &#34;Miasma&#34; a lot too, but this album blows that one right out of the water. One of the best things about &#34;Nocturnal&#34; is that also possesses more black metal influences than on &#34;Miamsa&#34;. The lyrics on here are very evil and gory, and the musicianship is absolutely top-notch. Trevor Strnad's vocals are just excellent on here. He can alternate from beastly, guttural, inhuman death growls and bellows and evil nightmarish high pitched black metal-esque shrieks that will summon up the devil in you. John Kempainen and Brian Eschbach are both excellent guitarists and they make quite the duo. The riffs are just blistering and bone crunching, and the leads and solos by John (who plays lead guitar BTW) are very technical, ripping, and nicely clean and restrained. Shannon Lucas's drumming is just maniacal, slamming, and pummeling throughout with exploding, splattering, perfectly executed blast beats and wicked double bass slamming. Every song on this album is just great, I love every single song on here. The first track &#34;Everything Went Black&#34; is a great opening track that will immediately get your blood pumping with it's fiery, thrashing riffs, blasting drum work and demonic vocals. The guitar solo around the 1:44 mark is awesome as well. The second track &#34;What a Horrible Night to Have a Curse&#34; is another favorite on here that is highlighted by heavy, booming, thundering riffs that will just crush your bones into dust along with more fast pummeling drum blasts. The title track &#34;Nocturnal&#34; is my personal favorite on here that features pounding, splattering drum blasts and wicked double bass slamming, careening leads, a catchy growl/scream chorus, and a great headbanging solo. Other favorites include &#34;I Worship Only What You Bleed&#34;, &#34;Deathmask Divine&#34;, &#34;Of Darkness Spawned&#34; (which is highlighted by more fast, pounding double bass drum work, beastly growls, wild thrashing riffs, a fast, melodic careening solo, and an awesome mosh pit shout/scream part of &#34;The time to rise is upon us&#34;), &#34;Cimatic Degredation&#34; (highlighted by more fast, shredding riffs, another great ripping solo and more murderous double bass onslaughts) and &#34;To a Breathless Oblivion&#34; (which features two great guitar solos along with more slamming double bass drum onslaughts, and evil demonic growls and shrieks, and there's even some nice acoustic strings near the end).

1405073152|4.0|Ironically, I had picked up Things Fall Apart from the local library just before it happened to be assigned to me for a history class. I suppose I had good, if accidental, foresight. As others have said, Things Fall Apart is a relatively short novel told in a straightforward yet elegant manner. The voice works well for this particular narrative, much of which focuses on the customs and rites of the Ibo people in the village in which the protagonist, Okonkwo, lives.<br /><br />What I find most impressive about Things Fall Apart is the way it renders all perspectives; the book doesn't seem to glorify or demonize any one culture, and it really doesn't pick sides. The book deals with an Ibo tribe as well as a group of European imperialists, and it would be easy to depict one faction as being pure and noble and the other as evil or backwards. However, Things Fall Apart takes the high road by illustrating the complex continuum of both: Yes, the Ibo people have some practices which might seem \\"savage\\" to our modern Western mindsets, but they also have strong senses of morality and righteousness and Achebe depicts this admirably. Likewise, yes, some of the European imperialists seem cruel and dismissive of the Ibo people, but others of them genuinely seem to be motivated by the interest of evangelizing and doing what they believe to be right and noble.<br /><br />While the book itself may seem like a simplistic tale, there are deep, complex issues at work here--issues that lead to questions with no easy answers which Achebe, for his part, does not attempt to supply. That's just as well. Sometimes a book need only ask the questions and allow readers to come to their own conclusions. So what is Things Fall Apart about? Well, ostensibly, the book can be divided into two halves. The first half centres on the life of a man named Okonkwo, his wives, his children, and the practices of his tribe. Some readers will complain, and have complained, that the lack of focused, singular plot in the first half of the novel is a problem. I disagree. I don't believe that all works of fiction are required to have one singular, specific plot route and I believe it was Achebe's intent to set the stage for what happens in the second part of the novel. In the first half of the novel, the readers get acquainted with Okonkwo and the Ibo people.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the second half of Things Fall Apart focuses on Okonkwo's exile and his return from exile. For seven years, he has to leave his village and return to his mother's village (I won't say why here, so as not to spoil the detail for prospective readers), and when he comes back, he finds that European imperialism has drastically altered his own village, Umuofia. This leads to the novel's main conflict. Achebe renders the culture clash in a very intriguing manner, one which left me unsure of how I felt about the various events that unfolded. Because the earlier chapters showed the Ibo culture in such detail, considerable sympathy is placed on them, but a Western reader will also be inclined to agree with some of the Western views (not all, I should hope). For example, in Ibo culture, twins are considered evil, so they're left out in the forest to die. However, when the Europeans arrive, they begin saving twins. Who is right? Is it right to trample on another culture if it means satisfying what your culture considers the greater good? Like I said, this novel asks some difficult questions, and there are no easy answers.<br /><br />Okonkwo is not a typical protagonist. He does not show compassion to others. He can be downright cruel, and he beats his wives and sons when they displease him. Yet, Okonkwo has reasons for what he does (not that it necessarily makes him right, but it does make his perspective understandable); he is upholding what he believes to be an ideal of Strength. In his own mind, he's a hero. And Okonkwo is not totally a monster; indeed, there are times when a hint of human feeling seeps through. I found his wives and children similarly compelling, but painted in brush strokes, such that much of their lives and personalities are not shown. What is shown is enough to whet your appetite for more.<br /><br />I docked this novel one star, and I made this decision for two reasons. The first is because I believe the transition between the book's two halves is somewhat unshaky. I understand the need for a transition, but I think Achebe could've handled it somewhat more gracefully. As it is, I feel he plowed through and forced Okonkwo to leave under fairly flimsy and dubious, abrupt circumstances. The second reason I took off a star is because towards the end, the book stops being so evenhanded, and some of the missionaries turn Evil. At least, this is how I perceived it. What one of the Europeans says at the end of the novel seems almost like a caricature; read it and you'll see what I mean. Before, I thought Achebe was doing such an admirable job of showing the strengths and weaknesses of both sides, but in the end, \\"things fall apart\\".<br /><br />Even so, the book is good and thought-provoking. I recommend it. It's a fast read. Although it is not a happy novel, I never at any point found it oppressingly, suffocatingly depressing. Perhaps the lovely yet simple prose helped to keep the events of the novel from being too overwhelmingly unhappy. Everything transpires as if in a song or a dream. I disagree with reviewers who say that Achebe portrayed the Ibo people as \\"savages\\". If you saw that in the novel, I think it's because you are analyzing them with your own values. I didn't see that Achebe intended that at all. I did not feel that Achebe passed value judgments on the Ibo people, and for the most part, he restrained his judgments of the European imperialists as well.ldren similarly compelling, but painted in brush strokes, such that much of their lives and personalities are not shown.

B0015AARJI|5.0|I always hated the included controller because it felt cheap and weak and certain games that required rumble (The Warriors from PS2) couldn't be played.  Yay.  It's here.  Sucks that I had to spend $55 for a proper controller, but the product itself is great.  The best part is that the rumble doesn't seem to hurt the battery life noticeably.  I've used it and left it unplugged for a day or two at time and the battery life always seems OK.
6305736650|5.0|Outside of perhaps 3 other films this is very likely the most perfect film ever made. The selection of characters--Bogart, Bergman, Reins, Henreid--is absolutely ideal.--it is difficult to imagine any other actors playing these roles, or playing them as well. The acting and the directing are absolutely inspired. Shot in black and white the cinematography is excellent. The music and the plot twists are themselves spell binding--all in all a landmark film.
B000Y7U98W|4.0|Sunshine seems to have been created as part of a contest to see how many genres a director could fit in one movie. It's got its summer blockbuster special effects, its sci-fi atmospheric thriller moments, and even some slasher horror bits thrown in.    If only Sunshine's director Danny Boyle could pick one and stick with it, the movie could have been really good. As it is, though, Sunshine is a jumble. A really good-looking jumble.    The movie starts with such promise. It has a cool back story and enough science to satisfy and facilitate the suspension of disbelief. (The premise, and this is not a spoiler, is that Earth is slipping into an Ice Age due to a weakening and eventual extinguishing of the Sun. Eight astronauts are sent on a rescue mission to create a supernova of sorts -- to set off an explosion in the Sun and create a new star).    The beginning visuals are quite stunning, especially on a nice TV. There are frequent shots of the Sun, Mercury, and the outside of the spacecraft. And while the ship is cool to explore, the viewer begins to get a sense of dread. This is when the movie launches into its atmospheric thriller mode.    Something about space lends itself to the atmosphere of dread. Of course Alien is the standard most atmospheres are compared to, but this movie also reminded me of Descent. It must be the closed-off nature of space (and caves). Again, Sunshine succeeds. I was getting edgy watching by myself. The first time you see a subliminal image, yes, it really is there. I rewound frame-by-frame to see what the picture was, the whole time feeling like I was in a thriller myself, about to be shocked by the horror this freeze frame would contain.    This sense of dread is multiplied a hundred times when the crew is forced to investigate an abandoned spacecraft (the original mission that mysteriously failed seven years prior). I was fully prepared to be creeped out -- not startled by GOTCHA! horror. And that's where the movie begins to fall apart. All of a sudden, it turns into almost a slasher movie, complete with chases through dark hallways and stabbings.    From this point on, the movie spirals a bit out of control, although not terribly so. Chase scenes are interspliced with stop-action blurry shots of who-knows-what. The movie eventually paints itself into an ending you knew was coming, and one that leaves no room for a twist. It is a shame the movie becomes so muddled, because it had a chance to be an absolutely great sci-fi flick. (Something that The Core, for example, gave up two minutes into the film).    Sunshine is worth a see. Just don't expect too much.    Sunshine Rating: 75 / 100  Subratings  Soundtrack: 8 / 10 (surprisingly good, but one of the stranger choices for the end credits)  Acting: 7 / 10 (never felt very attached or invested in any characters, though they are forced to make some tough choices)  Sci-Fi Backstory: 7 / 10 (whole lot better than The Day After Tomorrow)
0714843377|2.0|I was very disappointed in this book after reading the multiple reviews of it on Amazon.    Arden advocates that \\"it's wrong to be right\\" and \\"it's right to be wrong\\", arguing that being right contradicts creativity since you're \\"not open to new ideas.\\"  I heartily disagree with his stance here because people that are searching for the \\"right\\" answer MUST be open to considering multiple points of view and opportunities in order to find the right answer; therefore the very idea that a person has come to a right conclusion presupposes that they are (or at least have been) open to new ideas.    When he talks about being wrong, he presents it as if it were a worthy goal to achieve. This section starts out with \\"Start being wrong and suddenly anything is possible\\".  Pretty erroneous in my opinion, but then again he would probably consider that to be a compliment.   I am sure you could get some benefit out of this book if you tried hard enough, but it would take some concentrated effort as the whole 126 pages contains similar low-content nonsense (like, \\"You don't have to be creative to be creative\\").  I wouldn't recommend spending actual money on this book, let alone taking the minimal amount of time required to read it.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Once is another movie that my friends got me really excited to see. (Previously, I had been told that Reign Over Me was better than a ten point scale could ever express. Big disappointment).    First off, I hate musicals. I say this never having seen an entire one. That being said, this is not the type of musical that has actors spontaneously bursting into song. Rather, it almost seems like a documentary on a songwriter.    By this, I mean that Once really gives an excellent feel of Dublin and its locals. When they are singing, it isn't because they are in a movie that is a musical; instead, it is because they're all... well... musicians. Each time a song is played, it seems extremely realistic.    Therein lies an interesting part of the movie, though. Even though the singing seems very natural, it also serves to develop the story -- not by explaining plot, but by explaining the history and feelings behind characters. This can be tough, because you're almost obligated to try to decipher the songs. As soon as I started just enjoying the music without trying to comprehend lyrics, I thought -- shoot! -- I'm missing dialogue.    The initial meeting of the guy and the girl is awesome. The actors (or musicians) truly click, and the viewer sees what could be the start of any romance in any other Hollywood flick. The not-quite-romance is a joy to watch begin. But, it never seems to get past this initial point.    If one of the movie's taglines is in regards to how often you find your soulmate, then I really wish that point had been pushed harder. While they were cool to watch with each other, I never got the sense that the guy and the girl were meant for each other. For whatever reason, in my mind, I was comparing the couple to the couple in Good Will Hunting. In that movie, I really got the sense that Will would have fought for his girl. Not in Once. Maybe with some expanded run time, this could have happened.    Oh -- I thought of a better example. Johnny Cash & June Carter in Walk the Line. The initial meeting is just as cool as the one in Once, but the viewer really sees the relationship develop into something where both Johnny and June are willing to fight for one another. In Once, honestly, I just feel like the guy and girl are wondering \\"what could have been,\\" instead of pursuing being together. Maybe that was the point of the movie.    All considered, Once is definitely worth a watch. Rather than watch it again, though, I would be more likely to listen to Glen & Marketa's album (which is called The Swell Season).    Once Rating: 79 / 100  Subratings:  Acting: 6/10 -- I realize they are musicians first, actors second  Music: 9.5/10  \\"Feel\\" of the movie: 9/10 -- I really enjoyed the documentary-ish feel of the movie
B00139W3NE|5.0|I love fantasy and adventure stories have read and enjoyed the books by Philip Pullman on which the movie is based.  The movie did a great job of bringing the story to life and giving enough of the background details from the book to keep the story moving without bogging things down. I feel the movie was very true to the books and gorgeous to watch.  The actors are all top notch and captured the spirit of the characters in the book.  Dakota Blue Richards is absolutely perfect as Lyra.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|I hate to give this cd a 1, but its really bad.  I don't know what happened to the creative Madonna that used to put out really good stuff, and every album she made was \\"unique\\" and stood out above the rest.  I am very dissapointed.  Nothing in this album in my opinion stands out.  Each track just makes you want to skip to the next and the next until you realize that the album is over.  The somewhat ok tracks in this album in my opinion are: 9, 11, and 12.  Maybe they will be released as singles with remixes and they will really be more catchy.  Otherwise, please give me the next album, hopefully that one will be better than this.
1401207928|4.0|The book, like the movie, is astounding. But... Perhaps, either too jaded by the movie or not enough of a fan of the graphic novel, there is something missing in the novel that makes the movie so wonderful... I believe that too much is given away in the book at the beginning that is left a mystery until the very end, if ever, of the movie, and with that knowledge the book is somewhat dampened. Still absolutely worth read.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|With the last of the Stargate series, it was good to have one more story with details filling in and completing parts that were left unfinished. I enjoyed it very much and am sorry to know they have completed their mission.  Not much in the way of good Sci-Fi now.    This DVD is worth having in your Stargate collection.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is one of those small low-budget films that can stand on its own without fancy effects or scenery.  It is a beautiful relationship story with a fantastic soundtrack.  I especially enjoyed the scene with the vacuum--you just have to see it for yourself.  The true-to-life relationship reminded me of another great indie film, [[ASIN:B000Z8HI5C Time and Tide]].  The two actors have phenomenal voices so if you need another reason to see this movie, the music should be it.  An excellent choice for your next date!
B00104QSOM|2.0|As a movie, this movie is not any good.  There Will Be Blood is a film about Daniel-Day-Lewis as an oil man who has a son and a bowling alley, but it's not like Vice Versa or like The Big Lebowski.  The story begins in the time of World War I, when gold prospectors and oil prospectors were looking for gold and oil, respectively, whilst real Americans were fighting the Germans.  I don't want to make my review too political, though, because I could go on for days!    Daniel-Day-Lewis plays his part like a game show host, and for all the talk of how wonderful he is in the role, I just don't get it.  He got an Oscar for this?  I think he did not deserve the Academy Award over Clint Eastwood for the Space Cowboys movie.  I know that the Academy probably feels they've awarded Clint too much in the past, but I think that's silly because he's so talented and just because he's always great, doesn't mean a cliched movie like There Will Be Blood should benefit!!    I don't like that the movie is in black and white, although stylistically I understand what Paul Thomas Anderson was going for.  The guy that played the priest was really good, and I was rooting for him to beat Daniel-Day-Lewis in every scene.  This movie might have made more sense if they cut the part about Daniel-Day-Lewis' son--there is such a thing as too much plot!--and focused on the oil parts, since that's what it's about.    I'm not saying that There Will Be Blood should have been a musical, but if the directors had made it a little peppier, it might have been a fun little film.  As it is, it's probably one of the worst things you could ever watch, and when your kids say they want to see it you should make sure to watch it with them because it has strong adult themes.    I believe in America, but I do not believe in this movie.  I love the milkshake part though, because it's so true.
B00005JMJG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time!  I saw this in the theater 3 times and own the DVD.  Although it is an indie drama, I feel like everyone can enjoy this movie.  The plot is very clever and not as strange as it sounds.  It made me laugh, cry, and think--excellent.  Underneath it all, the relationship is very true-to-life and reminds me of other indie love stories like [[ASIN:B000X1Z0BU Once]] and [[ASIN:B000Z8HI5C Time and Tide]].  If you are interested in a thoughtful, funny, and touching movie, you should see this!
B00005JPS7|5.0|I saw it yesterday afternoon.<br /><br />I did something very bad. I should have known better being a comics head.<br /><br />Ya never walk out before the credits are done.<br /><br />Let's dispense with the minor caveats first. Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was a little foppish. He did a great job otherwise, and I wasn't one of those whining about him being chosen for the role. Although if this were twenty years ago, you would have had to give the role to Tim Dalton or I would have called for a boycott. Despite the slight lack of seriousness in Downey's portrayal, I really can't imagine anyone else doing the role justice. He got to the heart of Tony Stark, the conflicted billionaire industrialist with an armored alter ego, even if I would have preferred Downey's Stark to be a little darker. Perhaps we'll get that in the sequel.<br /><br />And the Iron Monger? I think I would have rather seen the Titanium Man or the Crimson Dynamo. Iron Monger didn't appear until way later in the comics and did himself in not long afterwards. However, Jeff Bridges was a fine choice, and held up his end well. If you weren't into the comics, you didn't see his double-cross coming. But when I heard the name \\"Obadiah Stane\\" (now I know how to pronounce it after 20 years), I thought \\"Uh-oh.\\" Which brings me to what really got me into this movie. The foreshadowing...<br /><br />There's a terrorist group called The Ten Rings. Hmmm...The Mandarin wears ten rings, one on each finger. James Rhodes eyes up a spare suit of armor. SHIELD is mentioned. Then there was that little cameo I missed...<br /><br />The creative balance that was achieved also struck me. It's as if the makers were very mindful in creating a film with comics fans, casual moviegoers, and thinking viewers in mind. The changes made from the comics to the screen were necessary, otherwise it would have had to be a period piece and wouldn't have been nearly as relevant. In fact, my distaste for what has been done with Iron Man as of late in the comics, has been neutralized at least somewhat due to this movie. Redemption, in my mind, was one of this film's messages. The idea of war profiteering is addressed. Tony Stark, after surviving capture and seeing what his killing technology (apologies to Voivod), has wrought, decides he will not longer profit from manufacturing weapons. That plot point alone makes Iron Man a more timely superhero movie than any other I can think of.<br /><br />Downey's protagonist and Bridge's antagonist aren't the only stars who shine. Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts really captures the Girl Friday aspect of Potts' character as well as that of someone who's \\"just a friend\\" to a superstar guy. Terrence Howard's James Rhodes also impressed me as he came off as more than just a mere sidekick and straight man. Howard and Downey really had the \\"buddy mojo\\" working. You really believed that these two men from two totally different worlds and lifestyles could be the best of friends just as they are in the comics.<br /><br />And of course the special effects were godly. The armor looked so real you felt as if you could touch it. Iron Man flew and ducked and dove like a half-man/half experimental aircraft. Yet, it didn't seem totally robotic either. The armor had an organic sense to it also, looking as human as a living weapon could without sacrificing the tech.<br /><br />To tell the truth though, I could have done without the missles. Iron Man is not a tank. Repulsor rays are just more elegant, and they weren't neglected. But again, minor caveat. The fights were spectacular. When Iron Man and Iron Monger clashed, it was a cross between two knights battling for virtue and vice and two machines making war for the common good or ill of humankind.<br /><br />So what we have here is an excellent heroic fantasy tale with a touch of James Bond, a swig of Golden Age cinematic romance, and a pro-peace message that takes more than a jab at the military/industrial complex. It's a film that I can effortlessly refer to anyone, lovers of comics and cinema alike. Although it may not have the emotion and drama that the Spider-Man, Batman, X-Men, and Superman outings have had, I believe that Iron Man will go down over time as the most properly executed work in a genre that most filmmakers still have yet to grasp.<br /><br />Respect the source material and the field in which the tales are originally told, and you will reap dividends, creatively and commercially. Let Iron Man be yet another lesson to Hollywood.alike.

1577314808|5.0|The author translates mysticism into understandable language and concepts. He speaks to the man or woman on the street rather than from his ivory tower of vagueness and superiority. He makes happiness accessible and attainable for the average person. Extremely interesting is that all of us have already experienced enlightenment in small doses throughout our lives, but we never recognized this feeling for what it is. Many comments in the book are surprising and amusing, making it a compelling read.  The book also serves a self-help guide for working through difficult situations that are presented in a way that the reader can easily relate and recognize his/her own personal experiences. I found this most helpful.   On the down side, some of the concepts are hard to grasp, even though they are explained in simple terms, but this is not the fault of the author. It takes time to absorb, comprehend and come to terms with some of the things he writes. Also, there is a lot of repetition in the book (plus, many of the ideas in this book are repeated in \\"A New Earth\\"), but repetition is fine with me since many important points need to be hammered into our minds and delivered in different ways to reach different readers.  This is a book that I will be revisiting for a long time. I have read numerous books of this type and find this one to be refreshing and more realistic than others in this genre.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout.  It totally kicks my butt. I have only done Level I 3 times and I am already noticing results. I am getting shredded and in only 20 minutes a day. Wow! I like Jillian's instruction.  I wish she gave a little more instruction on how heavy the weights should be for the different exercises. otherwise, it;s a great workout.. She's very motivating.
0786939532|5.0|Salvatore grabbed our attention with the Icewind Dale trilogy, and one of the heroes of that unlikely group of friends was Drizzt Do'Urden, a drow (or dark elf, as they are often called). To our delight, Salvatore's next project, dubbed the Dark Elf trilogy, served as a prequel, to tell us about Drizzt's past, and to introduce us to the world of the drow.<br /><br />I cannot recall another author who so brilliantly immerses a reader in a wholly foreign world. It is one thing, to describe a world similar to ours, such as Raymond E. Feist's introduction of the Tsurani, yet even that is loosely based on Asian culture. It is quite another to transport the reader into another world so radically different from our own, and do it with a style which keeps us turning the pages at an addictively fast pace.<br /><br />The book begins on the night Drizzt is born, where he is to be sacriced to Lloth, the drow deity, often referred to as the Spider Queen. Yet, as is normal within this dark and twisted subterranean world, his older brother kills the eldest brother. With a Do'Urden male having been sacrificed, Lloth is appeased, and Drizzt is spared. In an interesting inversion, the world of the drow is matriarchal, and family is everything. The head of the family is female, and the holders of the seats in Council (the leadership of the drow city of Menzoberranzan) are all female. Males are, in that world, secondary to females, and are useful only as cannon fodder in times of war, and as donors in the act of reproduction.<br /><br />Right from the start, Drizzt is remarked on as being very different, with lavender coloured eyes. Yet his true difference is inside, for he is posessed with morales and compassion - virtues which are practically unheard of in a drow. Fortunately, his father, Zaknafein, is mostly responsible for his weapons training from the age of 16, where Drizzt is somewhat sheltered from the true nature of the evil drow, as Zaknafein is a kindred spirit to Drizzt.<br /><br />After, Drizzt is sent to the Academy, to further advance his skill at fighting. For 10 years he remains there, learning the true nature of the drow, and battling to hold on to his spirit and morals. If he fails, he risks falling prey to the lies of the Spider Queen, and turning into everything he hates.<br /><br />I'll say no more, for I encourage you to read this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The only thing I'll warn you of, is how very difficult it is to put the book down once you've started! Salvatore does an excellent job in immersing us in the world of the drow, and in better understanding the emotional battles and sacrifices the noble character of Drizzt Do'Urden went through, to mold him into the fighter/ranger he became.o the Academy, to further advance his skill at fighting.

B000002L7R|2.0|In the context of hindsight, there is a reason this one gets overlooked in Prince's catalogue - and that is because it is just not very good.  Amazing that this thing is sandwiched right in the middle of \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain\\" before and \\"Parade\\" and \\"Sign 'O' the Times\\" after.  Amazing because those four albums are so, so good, and this one is so, so bad.  I don't think it's because it follows a blockbuster like \\"Purple Rain\\" that \\"Around the World in a Day\\" gets a bum rap.  It really is because it's just not a good album.  I do think this was done a bit deliberately, to take some of the pressure off after the mega-success of \\"Purple Rain\\".  Just get something out to market, to lower expectations and keep the record company from demanding \\"Purple Rain, Part Two\\".  It obviously worked because the relative failure sales-wise of this one (it hit LP cut-out bins rather quickly) gave him the artistic freedom to then release, back-to-back, two more (really three, because \\"Sign\\" was a double) great albums .    There were two killer singles from this album (\\"Raspberry Beret\\" and \\"Pop Life\\") and those can be found on \\"hits\\" compilations.  Unlike the aforementioned four other albums, the non-single album tracks on this thing are not all that well constructed, sometimes don't really seem to go anywhere, and are definitely a bit noisy and grating at times.  This one has not aged well.  I am not really sure how this one is considered \\"psychadelic\\".  All this album really does is basically take all the worst aspects of Prince's mid-80s signature computerized-electronic-drum sound and stretch it out over the course of a very disjointed album.    The CD packaging also sucks in comparison to that of the 1985 vinyl LP.     Perhaps the original complete album art will be restored SOMEDAY when Prince's catalogue is MAYBE FINALLY REMASTERED (hell, Bananarama's 1980s albums have been remastered (!!!) (was there much demand for that, btw???), why the hell not Prince?).
1591841984|4.0|If you like Apple or Steve Jobs, you should probably read this book. It's got a lot of interesting stories that give you background into some of the most important innovations and inventions of the last 20 years. You learn about the creative, business, product development, and marketing side of Apple that isn't explicitly apparent. You learn about why and how they keep things so secret and you learn about why their team is so good at creating world-changing products.    However, the one negative of the book is the way the author jumps all over the place. Stories sometimes seem to be randomly placed one after another with no logical transition. The author can also get very repetitive, re-introducing certain people such as Jonathan Ives numerous times. It's almost as if he took different magazine articles and put them into his book without removing the introductions. Besides reintroducing people, the author also makes the same points over and over to the point where you feel a sense of deja vu. Finally, I found it awkward when he went on an unprovoked bashing session against HP when discussing why their recent advertising campaign with the hands doing cool things would never measure up to any Apple ad. I thought it was a pretty decent ad.    At first, I felt this was a great book to read. In the beginning, it was very hard to put down. But by the end, I felt a little cheated. Every time a magazine comes out with an article about Apple or Steve Jobs, I jump at the chance to read it. After reading this whole book, I realized that this book is mostly a compilation of all those magazine articles I read. Then again, the author is a magazine editor so what can I expect?
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Let me preface this by saying I am a huge Madonna fan.  I have bought every one of her releases on or near the date of their release going back to \\"True Blue\\" when I was 10 years old.  Over the years I have liked some of her albums more than others (wasn't a big fan of \\"Bedtime Stories\\" although it had some decent tracks and was bored by \\"Ray of Light\\" but really liked \\"Music\\", \\"Confessions\\", \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\").  Hell, I even thought \\"American Life\\" (the album, not necessarily the song about soy lattes, etc.) had its charms.    That said, this release is not just the WORST Madonna album I have ever heard, it is among the WORST albums that I have ever had the displeasure of listening to and/or owning (and I own over 2,000 cds).  This is complete dreck.  Why she would team up with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and The Neptunes NOW (in 2008) to make an album that sounds like it should have been released in 2004 is beyond comprehension.  Granted, Madonna has never been as \\"cutting edge\\" as she has been given credit for being (i.e. \\"vogueing\\" was actually a fad that had passed by the time she released that song, 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\" was a retread of '92/'93 R&B, Vanilla Ice in the \\"Sex\\" book 2 years after he became a has-been was odd, and \\"Ray of Light\\" was about a year late on the electronica bandwagon).  Nonetheless, she always seemed to have some strong music (and singles) to back up being a bit behind the trend-curve and was able to make it work.      This time around, there is nothing to recommend.  The first track is completely insipid and a bit gross when you consider it is a nearly 50 year-old woman singing about letting you eat at her \\"Candy Shop\\" and later on down the line we hear another little ditty about how \\"sex with you is amazing\\" (repeated about 10,000,000 times, apparently in order to flesh out an entire track's worth of music with some sort of semblance of \\"lyrics\\").      The music is just like the album cover - ridiculous, cheap-looking(sounding), unimaginitive, stupid, awful, over-the-hill, washed-up and incredibly meritless.  This woman has been around nearly three decades and has sold tens of millions of albums, and the best she could come up with for a producer was Justin Timbelake and his crew?  If she wanted to have sex with Justin Timberlake, she should have just slipped him some GHB rather than waste an entire album's worth of sessions seducing him under the \\"guise\\" of attempting to make \\"music\\" with him and his \\"producers\\").  (That said, she must be one bad booty call, because from the sounds of this thing, he gave her the leftover rejects of his last two albums.)    Again, I have every CD this woman has ever released, including \\"special editions\\" of some, so I am not coming on here as some Madonna-hater looking to get my rocks off by ripping on her \\"homosexual music\\".  But, this one really is a complete dog.  It is the musical equivalent of \\"Shanghai Surprise\\".        Basically, to sum up, think of it this way -- remember how bad and embarrasing the \\"rap\\" on the song \\"American Life\\" was when you first heard it?  Remember how you felt embarrased for her?  Remember how utterly awful lyrics about pilates, hotties, and not being a \\"christian or jew\\" seemed?  Now imagine that concept expanded to entire album's worth of material.

B00004Z4WR|4.0|I'm a fan of Nicholas Cage and Angelina Jolie so that may have influenced me some along with the fact I liked the rest the cast as well. However, I was never a big fan of the original version. I do like this remake and the storyline is more entertaining and family friendly than the original. More of an \\"Oceans 11\\" version just as that remake is a little more palatable to families today. That isn't to say the originals aren't good classics, they are just a little rougher for some to take. The current version of this movie moves along at a steady pace and although you know the general circumstances you're never quite be sure what may happen next.<br /><br />A great ex-car thief in retirement is running a go-kart track and finds out his kid brother's life is at stake over a fifty car heist, he jumps in to bail his brother out. He assembles his old gang and uses some of his brothers group as well to try to pull off a one night theft of all fifty cars. Meanwhile their actions are being monitored by the police and the local gang that doesn't like the competition. Lots of action and driving cars of all types at high speeds. Fans of car shows will probably like it best, but it will have some appeal to all but the very young. Good quality DVD and plenty of replayability.

0452289963|5.0|This book helped me see the world in its true light. Learning about the ego gave me some \\"aha\\" moments. I thought I knew myself pretty well, but after reading \\"A New Earth\\" I have a better understanding of why I do the things I do and why other people act the way they do. The spiritual references and explanations were helpful and uplifting. The book has an important message. I read it slowly, and even took notes to better absorb what the author had to say. The teachings in this book can provide hope and a map for building a better life.
1416914293|1.0|A friend gave me City of Bones & City of Ashes to read because I am a big BtVS fan. I am so very glad I did not buy them. Both books are unoriginal, dull and have such flowery prose I must have rolled my eyes 5,000 times. Teenagers do not talk like Clary, Simon or Jace in any universe I know.    Reading City of Ashes was like trying to get away from a slow moving train wreck. I wound up skimming the middle bit to get to the end as it was so tedious. Besides the obvious Buffy rip offs, the book just doesn't hold up to muster in the youth genre. I'd rather reread Holly Black or Stephenie Meyer any day of the week, then torture myself with City of Ashes again.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Standards have been rising in the comic adaptation genre, and the new Iron Man comes in at the top of the range. This is one of the best comic adaptations ever, and a very good action flick in itself. It gets the summer movie season off to a flying start - if the rest of the season's movies rise to this level, it's going to be a great year.<br /><br />Effects are everythig you could ask, with lots of explosions, fire, and other good enterainment - but that's the norm these days. Plenty sets this apart from the pack. Acting is way up there, as the star-laden cast would have you expect. Scripting offers a blend of humor, action, sneering bad guys, and simmering romance that's hard to beat. It gives Robert Downey Jr. lots to work with, including an outstanding aide in the form (the lovely form) of Paltrow's \\"Pepper Potts.\\" The main bad guys are the current evil-du-jour, mideastern madmen - so recognizable that they don't even need motives. Heck, even the industrial robots have more personality than the entire casts of some comic flicks.<br /><br />One of the most implausible of plot turns really brought this to life for me: Stark's sudden rethinking of the multi-generation arms business. As an engineer and as one who's tried (not always successfully) to keep my work out of weapons, that exerted more of a pull than there was any rational reason to expect. But that's way too serious for this movie. Even if it jumps the season by a few weeks, it's great summer fun.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B000002MNL|5.0|I was ready to walk away from \\"popular\\" music forever until this came along. Come to think of it I may still, but not without bringing Vauxhall and I. A beguiling collection of songs and possibly the finest of his genre (whatever his genre truly is).
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I was really depressed at the end of this movie.  I'm not sure if it was because the movie did such a good job with its theme or just because it was depressing.<br /><br />Some elements were excellent.  Will Smith had a heavy load to carry in this movie and he is great in it.  His loneliness is palpable -- talking to mannequins he set up in the video store where he checks out the movies in alphabetical order and listening to old recorded newscasts.  The scene where he flips out because one of his \\"friends\\" has been moved shows how close to the edge his loneliness has brought him.<br /><br />I also loved the CGI New York landscape.  It seemed very realistic.  And finally, the animated short stories included in the DVD were quite interesting.<br /><br />I wasn't as fond of some other elements.  The \\"monsters\\" looked too much like Gollum and too much uniformly alike; they would have been better done with actors and more individual makeup.  Also, it was not clear whether they were devolved to a purely animal level or if they still retained intelligence.  That made the scene with the moved mannequin and the rope trap a little confusing.  Did they set the trap or was Neville so on edge that he forgot one of his own traps?  It was also not clear what the infected ate with only Neville left as potential prey.  And if animals could be infected, why was Neville hunting deer that didn't act infected?<br /><br />As great a job as Will Smith did playing his part, the amount of time with just one actor and a dog on screen was too long and the flashback scenes didn't provide enough explanation of how it was that Neville became the last surviving person on Manhattan, much less how the virus killed off most of the world.<br /><br />And finally, a caution for people who still have older analog TVs:  this movie is visually dark and that resulted in many scenes that were just black screens with the music track in the background.  I suspect there was stuff that people with larger digital TVs would be able to see.
B000FVQYYK|4.0|I like this CD. It has a lot of Queen influence in the vocal and music department. It also has a very Art Rock approach in the music. The musicianship is amazing and always interesting. This Cd was recommended in a Prog Magazine as an album of rock with prog embellishments. I would have to agree. I'm not sure I hear the Rush influence as others have mentioned. I hear more Queen and U2. I think they should move away from the U2 and stick with the Queen influence. Whatever the case is, the CD is very enjoyable like a real good Adrian Belew CD.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna usually works with unknown or rising producers.  However, for \\"Hard Candy,\\" she teamed up with r&b/hip-hop royalty (Timbaland, Pharrell); Justin Timberlake even turns up to provide vocals and Kanye West raps.  As a result, the CD feels manipulative and maybe even a tad desperate - one last attempt to remain relevant.  It reminds me of her earlier \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" which featured Babyface and also tilted toward an r&b edge.  Clearly, Madonna wanted to make a CD full of hits.  Fortunately, what \\"Hard Candy\\" lacks in organic-sounding music it more than makes up for with great songs.<br /><br />The first single, \\"4 Minutes,\\" has Timbaland's fingerprints all over it, and Madonna at times seems like a supporting player to Tim and Justin.  However, its marching band opener sounds pretty original and gave Madonna her biggest U.S. hit (peaking at #3) since \\"Music\\" rose to #1 back in 2000.  Impressively, \\"4 Minutes\\" provided Madonna with her 37th top 10 U.S. hit, allowing her to surpass Elvis as the artist with the most top 10 hits of the rock era.  Quite an accomplishment!<br /><br />The second single will be \\"Give It 2 Me,\\" produced by Pharrell.  It's actually one of the weaker songs on the CD, with annoying shouting at the end of each part of the chorus.  However, the break is quite good, with Madonna repeatedly singing \\"get stupid.\\"  Other songs on the CD arguably would be better candidates for release - let's hope that one of these is the third single.  My favorite song is \\"Incredible,\\" which really is.  \\"Miles Away\\" is also terrific - one of the few slower paced ballady songs on the CD with lyrics that may hint at her much publicized marital problems.  Even with a candy gloss, Madonna's lyrics can have bite.  Finally, \\"Candy Shop\\" features some rather obvious innuendo but sounds absolutely amazing - like a bizarre mash-up of Sheena Easton's \\"Sugar Walls\\" and Nelly Furtado's \\"Maneater.\\"<br /><br />Only two songs are duds - the awkward \\"Spanish Lesson\\" (sounding too much like a cross between Justin's \\"Senorita\\" and Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita\\") and \\"Voices,\\" which features Justin too prominently.  Yes, \\"Hard Candy\\" is flavored with artificial sweetener, but much of Madonna's music in the latter stages of her career lacks a certain organic feeling.  Gone are the days of earthier singles such as \\"Like  Prayer.\\"  However, \\"Hard Candy\\" is a worth addition to her oeuvre that reminds us yet again why Madonna is truly the Queen of Pop.between Justin's \\"Senorita\\" and Madonna's \\"La Isla Bonita\\") and \\"Voices,\\" which features Justin too prominently.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Wow, this is the catchiest Madonna album I've heard in years!  I think Madonna really tried to go back to her roots here (\\"Beat Goes On\\" sounds like something from 1983!) while creating something current and hip like \\"4 Minutes\\".<br /><br />There are at least 4 or 5 (or more) hit singles off this album, I think.  \\"Give It To Me\\" is my pick for the 2nd single.  It's a bit different, it's catchy, and it has a sing-a-long quality to it.  Oh and those synths in the chorus are awesome!  \\"Beat Goes On\\" is another hit single.  Like I said, it sounds very 1983 and something that's for the dance floor and is probably closest to 80s disco.  \\"Heartbeat\\" is another hit single that's probably a hybrid of 80s dance and today's pop r&b.  It sounds like a Timbaland-laced groove with 80s synth arpeggios all over.  \\"She's Not Me\\", another early 80s-like groove, is another favorite of mine.  I hate that bridge, though.  The dance floor claps, whistles, and funky guitar are obviously trying to capture the late 70s/early 80s disco vibes...TOOT TOOT! LOL.  \\"Dance 2Night\\" is another dance floor track, complete with Chic-like funky guitars, but more for the early or late crowd in the clubs.  Not a great track, but a nice tune to sway to.<br /><br />\\"Miles Away\\" sounds like something from \\"Music\\", with the synthesized, acoustic guitar sounds and all.  Good song for those introspective days in your bedroom.  \\"Spanish Lesson\\" sounds a bit pointless, to me.  She should've hired Daddy Yankee or Wisin Y Yandel to do a reggaeton vibe instead! It could've been a reggaeton hit. LOL.<br /><br />\\"Devil Won't Recognize You\\" sounds nice.  It sounds like something that Linkin Park produced.  Nice melody, introspective, a bit dark. \\"Voices\\", the last song, is another dark, introspective tune that sounds like it belongs in a dungeon.  LOL.<br /><br />Ooops, I forgot the first song \\"Candy Shop\\".  It's basically a \\"warmup\\" for the whole album. I guess Madonna created it as an introduction for the listeners.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a VERY good album and definitely worth owning!VERY good album and definitely worth owning!
B000YXMMAE|2.0|I've never been a Radiohead fan, but several persons whose musical taste I generally trust have been slobbering all over In Rainbows.  So I actually paid for it, and after several listens, I'm still trying to figure out what people see in this CD.  It reminds me of a collection of the lower end of the Coldplay catalogue.  Maybe you need good headphones or good weed (I have neither) to appreciate this one.  Music is a subjective experience, but for my money, there's much better stuff going on out there.

B000QRIGLC|4.0|As a vet of the military, I have always had great respect for people who join the special forces.  I was very interested in this account, as I had been heartbroken to read the news back in 2005.  The SEALS are a relatively small community and to lose 2 seal teams was a devastating loss.      That being said, I agree with a previous reviewer in that I wish Luttrell had focused more on his buddies that did not make it out of Afghanistan alive. They can never tell their stories and he had such a wonderful opportunity here to do so, I'm disappointed that he didn't take advantage of that opportunity.  This book gives you a detailed account of what it's like to be a Navy SEAL and a very tragic account of what happened up in the mountains of Afghanistan.  The courage of the men who serve in the SEALs is, to me, unfathomable.  What they went through, and that they fought until the very end without giving up was heartbreaking.    Luttrell put too much of his personal political views (alhtough none of which were backed up with any facts)into this book by constantly blaming the \\"liberals\\" for everything that went wrong.  The book could have done without that.  Other than that, I came away from this book more impressed with the men who become Navy SEALs than I was before.  It's a good read, and I think, an important story to get out to the public.

B0013FXWU6|5.0|I went into There Will Be Blood not knowing what to expect other than the presence of Daniel Day Lewis. What I found was a great tragedy painted in greys that edge toward darkness through the course of the story, no recourse anywhere to be found. I first took notice of Day Lewis in Gangs of New York and was deeply moved by his performance of Bill the Butcher; his portrayal of the oilman in Blood was a massive advance in both depth and subtlety. For me, the story is run by the characters - and by Day Lewis' character especially, who is nearly constantly onscreen -which is to say that the particulars of the story aren't important; this is a myth, painted in the dark tones of human interaction. Every ounce of 'false' human warmth is stripped away (and the riveting score assuredly helps with that)to give us a portrait of human greed so essential and to the bone that I, at least, was spellbound. I would almost say horrified, but I think \\"dread\\" is a better word. It's very understandable that many people don't come to movies for this sort of experience, and dislike Blood. Day Lewis shows us an unknowable man - from the start you feel that he may be a terrible man, and as the story unfolds you see that it is true; for me, the oilman's darkness was not far beneath the surface, and the portrayal of this may have intentionally paralleled the movie's ostensible topic - the search for underground oil. Day Lewis' portrayal makes the story that much more painful because we never know why he is the way he is; and we can never truly put a finger on who he is, though we undoubtedly know he is a 'bad man'. Most people like badness nailed down - call it 'evil,' make it obvious, have a clearly 'good' opposition, etc. You'll find none of that here; to me, it's the ambiguity in the face of such utter terribleness that makes this movie profound.

B00005J9M3|4.0|After the lush ad rich singles on [[ASIN:B000002UTK Introspective]], Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe switched gears and made a low-key album that actually was introspective. \\"Behavior\\" tightened up the song lengths, reigned in the sarcastic irony (somewhat) and - to a great extent - made a coming out record. \\"Behavior\\" is almost Steely Dan-ish in its quality, a full-bore attempt to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Which is why starting off the album with the cool, tongue-in-cheek \\"Being Boring\\" is so perfect. Addressing the night-life chaos of the 70's and 80's, Neil fast-forwards to the 90's and the sudden realization that AIDS has wiped the slate of friends and associates....as he wistfully notes:<br /><br />\\"We were always looking back, hoping that<br />you could always rely on a friend.\\"<br /><br />From there, we take looks at the hell of boarding school (\\"This Must Be The Place I Waited Years to Leave\\"), relationships gone sour (\\"Jealousy\\") and the pratfalls of becoming famous (the dance-hit \\"How Can You Expect To Be Taken Seriously\\"). But the overall tone of the album is low-key, and some of the best songs here reflect that. In particular, the aging Russian Writer's lament \\"My October Symphony.\\" It's given the same orchestra power of \\"Left to my Own Devices\\" but loses the disco pulse, as the vodka-sotted writer wonders if all those songs he wrote for his great cause are all just worthless words, since the revolution went bust. It plays with the notions of ideology and creation, and the ethical dilemma of what you compose vs what you believe. It's one of the best songs on the CD.<br /><br />Once Chris and Neil had this out of their systems, they took a brief hiatus. The excellent [[ASIN:B000002UZ4 Discography: The Complete Singles Collection]] was released in the interim, then their masterpiece [[ASIN:B000024QML Very]] three years later. I consider \\"Behavior\\" and \\"Very\\" to be a continual work, almost like a double album, Tenant and Lowe's creative high water mark. Get them both, and the versions with the bonus discs where possible.he bonus discs where possible.
B0013SJ44Q|5.0|Otis Redding had the rare ability to take a well known song and make it sound all his own. The best example of that skill appears on this essential album. He takes the Rolling Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" and transforms it from a guitar-driven rocker to a southern-fried R&B number. By replacing the seminal guitar hook with horns, Mr. Redding turns the Stones' complaint of into a plea. As with many soul singers, Mr. Redding has gospel roots and he covers three songs from the original gospel turned soul singer, Sam Cooke. \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\", \\"Wonderful World\\" and \\"Shake\\" show his versatilty as a singer. The first is a gospel driven tune, the second is pure pop music and the third is a frenzied, rave-up shouter. \\"Shake\\" would become a staple of his live shows and his performance of it at the Monteray Pop Festival and in the film of the concert would help him reach the mainstream white audience. Mr. Redding wasn't just an interpreter of other people's songs, but a solid songwriter is his own right. The album contains the original version of \\"Respect\\" and while it doesn't have the defiance of Aretha Franklin's version, it still moves. \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\" my well be the best song he recorded and it contains one of the most heartwrenching vocals ever put down on tape. Otis Redding's life was tradgically cut short, but he left us with this record as a reminder of his immense talent.  Otis Blue is one of defining soul albums of the 60's and one of the era's best albums period.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I just received the album yesterday. I reserved and was excited to listen to it. Last night, I listened to it and it is fantastic.   Her last album with Warner Brothers proves she has it and will continue with Live Nation.   The pop/dance/techno beats with $ minutes are iconic with JT and Timbalanc providing their best vocals. We only have 4 minutes to do something. IN Spanish Lessons, it is reminsicient of spanish eyes and has a nice guitar. In the Beats Goes on, it is full caliber with Kanye doing his thing and providing the material.   Pharell, also does well on Candy Shop and heartbeat.   She has proven time and time that she is effortless.
B000YABYLA|5.0|What can I say? I've now seen Juno once in the theatre and a number of times on DVD. Every time I've seen it, I'm all \\"faklempt\\" (meaning emotional or choked up for any non-yiddish, speakers out there) by the time the end titles roll. Call me a wimp or a weenie, but this movie gets me every time I see it. But isn't that, what the best movies do? Move something in you, get to your emotions. That was certainly my reaction to \\"Juno\\". You can argue the point, but I think that this little, low budget, indie-style comedy was one of the best movies of 2007.<br /><br />\\"Juno\\" is the comedy/drama story of Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page), a precocious, cocky, wise-cracking teenager, who suddenly finds herself pregnant, after sexually experimenting with her best friend Paulie (Michael Cera). After being put off by a visit to an abortion clinic, Juno answers an ad in the local 'Penny Saver' newspaper for 'adoptive parents'. They turn out to be Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) & Mark Loring (Jason Bateman) a yuppy-ish, childless couple, who have plenty of issues of their own. During the course of the film, we follow the next several months of Juno's life as a pregnant teen and her relationships with her parents, Paulie and the Lorings. What starts off as a very funny, screwball-ish, alternative comedy, eventually evolves into an emotional story, where Juno must find out, that she dosn't have all the answers. The last thirty-some weeks are not just a mere inconvienance, that will soon be forgotten. In the end, Juno must learn to \\"grow-up real fast\\", all while finding out the true meaning of love.<br /><br />Don't be put off, if the above plot synoposis sounds a little too much like an old 'ABC After School Special'. This is as far from the standard, Hollywood mush as you can get. First time screen writer, Diablo Cody and Director Jason Reitman have joined forces with a brillaint cast to create an imaginative, smart, well-written film, which is both funny and moving at the same time.<br /><br />I love the fact, that the script dosn't treat the characters or the audience like there a bunch of dummies. When was the last time a Hollywood film about teen pregnancy didn't make the parents out as a bunch of clueless, overeacting, yelling idiots, the teen father-to-be as a jerk or even wealthy yuppies to be one dimensional. Instead, this film very subtlety reveals different layers of these characters. You get to know these people and find out what makes them tick.<br /><br />Ellen Page as the film's title character is just wonderful. Page gives so much nuance in her performance. Just watch the emotions, that run across her face, when she is forced to reveal she's pregnant to her parents. She put in one of the best performances of the year. Hopefully this young actress will have a brillaint career ahead of her. The rest of the cast is equally good, showcasing stand-out performances from J.K. Simmons, Alison Janney, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Michael Cera.<br /><br />Finally, mention should also be made of the film's energetic music soundtrack, that features the works of anti-folkie, Kimya Dawson, British  alt-rockers, Belle & Sebastion and other various artists. These songs will get stuck in your head and keep you humming for days.<br /><br />This is a great movie, which has its' fill of both big laughs and tears. Highly recommended!t the script dosn't treat the characters or the audience like there a bunch of dummies.

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|Enough has been written about this that anything I can say will be repetition, but I'll repeat that if you haven't seen the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven, you have not seen this movie.  I liked the theatrical edition, but Scott's extended cut redefines the entire film.  The only downside, of course, is that you can't rent it to decide for yourself.  But I, for one, am glad I bought it.  The additional character development makes this film as smart and as moving as it is visually stunning.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Rufus has done it again. This is one damn good cd. Poses and Across the Universe are the best of the show, but the rest are wonderful too. Good Work Rufus , keep it up.....
B001437DMA|5.0|What's not to love about Satch. He's such a visionary, far beyond anyone else doing what he is. A guitarist for guitarists and more!! I have bought every album and dvd he has put out and have yet to get one that didn't make my jaw drop. His technique is flawless. His chord progressions flow seamlessly together while maintaining proper balance throught every song. This can be difficult to accomplish and when done properly the listener will know. Over the years I have watched him grow and mature. He is now a seasoned veteran who has much to teach us if we try to understand what his music says to our souls. I only wish there were more musicians out there like that.
0321544080|5.0|Novice to professionals will benefit from Joe McNally's experience as a photographer with Life, National Geographic, and Sports Illustrated. There are basic photographic tips for those that want to point and shoot with a little more flair. But more, there are very technical tips on how to use professional lighting systems to achieve very \\"unlit\\" natural results. This is by no means a dry step-by-step how-to book. It's written in a very conversational style: \\"oh, you want to know how I took that photo of Michelle (Pfeiffer), pull up a chair and let me tell you.\\" It is an easy read, filled with humor and tales of a journeyman photographer. The first read took me just a couple days at a few pages a day. A few weeks has gone by and I realize that I want to commit many more of McNally's tips to memory, that will take me a couple more rereads. I'm looking forward to it. The book is 50% fantastic photos (of who's who in sports and pop culture) and 50% how to make these photos.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|When this movie came out, it scared the daylights out of the masses. Great White sharks got a bad name and they became the hunted. Thirty years later and some real shark attacks later, this movie is not only still scary and entertaining, it is not far off the mark on how different facets of people really do react.
B00003CXCD|4.0|I love this movie, and that's why I was disappointed when I went to watch it and found that it was in full screen format.<br /><br />I suppose it's my fault for not looking carefully enough at the info here, but I assumed that the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" would be in widescreen - special editions are almost always in widescreen (at least, I've never found or bought one that wasn't).<br /><br />And what would possess them to chop off part of the screen for a film that has such excellent cinematography of Rome?  The movie begs to be in theatrical form.<br /><br />OK, I'm done whining.  Just know that if you buy this version, it's full screen.
B000TENMXO|5.0|I hear older guys always complaining that they \\"don't make music like they used to.\\" They always like to compare today's music with that which they grew up with, classic stuff from the 60's and 70's, where the music was a story, and the band made an album, not just a bunch of singles that were mashed together under the same title.<br /><br />Well, this is an album, not just a bunch of singles, and it is a testament to the history and greatness of both Rock and the British Invasion.<br /><br />Listening to \\"A Northern Soul\\" is a journey, reminiscent of Pink Floyd and the Moody Blues, wherein a story is told over the course of an entire album. Today's music is, yes, a bunch of singles meant to be published on the radio piecemeal by Corporate Radio and its sponsors. But the Verve have captured something far more meaningful than a handful of singles they intended to have sold separately to Corporate Listeners...they captured a feeling.<br /><br />The title track is the best, undoubtedly, but you can't listen to it without the rest, and you can't listen to it jumbled; it has to flow from the first, to the second, to the third, right down to the last track.<br /><br />Everyone knows \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" is one of the best rock songs ever, and certainly one of the best in the modern era, but the Verve are much more than just that one song; they are a story waiting to be told...through haunting guitar and a timeless voice.<br /><br />The Rolling Stones? With all due respect, they can kiss my @$$, because they decided to steal the Verve's well-deserved royalties for Ashcroft's incredible writing. HE wrote the song, HE deserves the credit for it, and the Verve deserve the royalties that THEY - not Mick Jagger and Keith Richards - earned.<br /><br />Listen to \\"The Last Time\\" by the Stones, then listen to \\"Bittersweet Symphony.\\" They're not the same song.

B0012Q732O|3.0|A ridiculous but pleasantly entertaining prehistoric epic by the director of \\"Independence Day\\". Set in 10,000 BC, it starts showing a tribe sporting Rastafarian dreadlocks as they hunt down woolly mammoths. After one of the warriors called D'Leh kills one beast all by himself, he gains as a trophy the hand of Evolet, the beauty of the tribe (played by Camilla Belle, a Lindsay Lohan look alike). But before D'Leh can enjoys his prize, a group of slave raiders attacks the tribe during dawn, and takes Evolet as captive. D'Leh along with some other tribesmen decides to track the raiders in order to free Evolet. In alliance with other tribes, they pursue the slave traffickers down to their home, a civilization building pyramids and ruled by an androgynous ruler that seems inspired by Ancient Egypt. The movie is full of inaccuracies, both historical and geographical (to name just a few, there were no domesticated horses in 10,000 BC, much less pyramids; at the start of the movie, the action seems to be happening in Northern Eurasia, but our heroes find themselves soon in Africa) but that's not the point, but to enjoy a good popcorn movie. Not quite as good as Apocalypto (which was its obvious model) but enjoyable nonetheless.

B000GRTQSE|4.0|Dylan's third \\"lounge singer\\" album improves on its predessors. The slow songs are especially good. Highlights: Spirit on the Water, When the Deal Goes Down, Workingman's Blues #2, Nettie Moore.<br />Also included in the \\"Special Limited Edition\\" is a DVD containing four fascinating music videos although \\"Love Sick\\" is probably a candidate for worst video ever with its background of swaying groovers.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|The other two \\"reviewers\\" have personal issues with Fox. Whatever one may think of the studio and it's bare bones Blu-Ray productions, I suggest it's more useful to actually review the film as it appears in Blu-Ray. I suggest reading this mature and thorough review, in which Master and Commander is given an almost perfect score with a more realistic and open minded appraisal.<br /><br />This is one of the most authentic, engaging period seafaring films ever produced. We may never see the like again. Everything about this film is quality, and that includes the transfer to Blu-Ray. Yes, I wish there had been more extras included. Yes, Fox has disappointed us by being stingy. But you can't fault the quality of the film, the acting, the directing and special effects. And the sound!  Magnificent.
B00144VBBS|5.0|This is an awesome collection of songs from Toby Keith.  The first CD is what made him famous and the second is who he is now.  Not real fond of the Mockingbird song though, but it is sung with his daughter so that's kind of cool.  All of these songs sound great and there are also some extended versions as well like \\"A Woman's Touch\\".  I had not heard this version until now and it sounds a lot better than the radio version.  To sum it up, if you are a Toby Keith fan buy this now and if you are not a fan, well give it listen and you might change your mind.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink's variety of pop/rock/ballad music is just flawless. Her songs are deep, rich, and just simply amazing, what else can I say? She always rocks to the top. She is a diva.    Key tracks: Who Knew, Long Way To Happy, Nobody Knows, U and Ur Hand, I'm Not Dead
0743454537|4.0|Aside from not caring for the writing style this author frequently uses, I did enjoy this book alot.  Its frustrating going from present to past and back again with each character having their own chapters.  I do think the author created an interesting story.  I definitely recommend this book.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I liked the movie, but I didn't like the camcorder-style video.   I know this was done on purpose as an I-reporter's point of view, but the larger the screen, the worse the motion sickness.    I can't imagine what it would have been like to be watching on a 80-ft wide screen.  All I know is, when I watched the movie on my smaller 24-inch tv, I had no problems, being that everything around the TV was motionless with the exception of the video.  When I played the DVD on my computer, sitting closer to the screen, the motion-sickness got more apparent.  I would advise those with a wide-screen HDTV to rent this movie first before buying it.    Overall, good story; I enjoyed the movie.  I just won't play the movie on my computer, that's all :)
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  They follow the book very well and do a remarkable job with such a great story.<br />If you are a Jane Austen fan and like the story to stick to the book, you will love this movie!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I didn't know what to expect when Madonna worked with hip hop producers this time around.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out she maintained the pop angle mixed in with the hip hop influence.  I've been a fan ever since I bought the \\"Borderline\\" single in '84, and always look forward to see what direction she's going to take next.  For me this is my favorite album since \\"Ray of Light.\\"  I enjoy it more with each listen and highly recommend it.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|While the 1st Van Halen record will always be my favorite, I did enjoy \\"Women And Children First.\\" While VH 1 has more of an 80s sound to it, VH 2 has a 70s sound. \\"Women and Children First\\" seems to have a little of each.<br /><br />\\"And the Cradle Will Rock\\" is a decent opener.  'Everybody Wants Some' is one of the most 80s sounding songs on the record. 'Fools' was strange, but interesting. 'Tora Tora' was unusual, but still good. 'Loss of Control' has kind of a strange sound, but it is good. 'Take Your Whiskey Home' is notably softer, but it has a great 70s charm. (Some would probably say 60s.) While also on the gentler side, 'Could This Be Magic' cleverly inserts the title of this 3rd record. In some ways, 'Could This Be Magic' steals the record. 'In a Simple Rhyme' is a bit anti climactic, but still good. Overall, it's a good record.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I mean \\"milder\\" in the sense that it's not nearly as violent or profane as some of their other work--not that I necessarily have a problem with either of the latter as long as it's necessary to the story. That's all.   Anyway...Apparently, the brothers based this screenplay on Homer's The Odyssey, and that makes me wish I had actually read it because then I would have a fuller understanding of what's going on.  Still, I enjoyed the weirdness and unexpected events--the sirens in the water, the one-eyed con man, the little girls singing, the sudden baptism, the camaraderie and chemistry among the three escaped convicts, and the climactic flood.  Minor quibbles:  Holly Hunter's role is so small that many other women could have played it; I'm not sure why George Nelson had to be in the film at all; I don't know if Klansmen really march around in formation and sing the way they do in the film; I remain in mystery as to the fates of Delmer and Pete at the end.  Quibbles aside, if you are a fan of the Coens, you will enjoy this odd, unpredictable, quirky tale.

0684830485|5.0|Robert Jordan is a young American fighting against the fascists in the Spanish Civil War.  He is sent into the mountains to make contact with a small band of guerillas to blow a bridge in support of an offensive.    Hemingway's tremendous strength of drawing characters that the reader comes to know and care about is on full display in \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\"  Jordan falls in love with the young woman, Maria, who is seeking refuge from a world that has robbed her of her childhood innocence.  There is Pablo, the former leader who has seen the futility of the war and cannot face the day without dulling his mind with wine.  There is Pilar, Pablo's mate, who longs for her youth, but has now assumed the role of leader and mother to the small group of fighters.    Robert Jordan and the reader come to know the dynamics of the group quite well.  Jordan wrestles with the necessity of endangering the group of people for \\"the cause.\\"  This book depicts the contrast of war's brutality with the camaraderie of friends.      \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is considered a classic for a reason.  This is a book that has aged well and will stick with the reader for a long time.
B000J10ERO|1.0|You gotta wonder what went through director Bryan Singer's head. After pretty much re-inventing the comic book movie wheel with the first two X-Men movies, he wisely stepped away from the franchise (resulting in the bloated dross that was X-Men: Last Stand), deciding to concentrate on a new superhero film, starring the world's best known hero.<br /><br />And guess what? It's even WORSE than the film he walked away from.<br /><br />For starters, Singer (along with seemingly the rest of the world) seems to think that the 1970s Superman movie, and in particular Christopher Reeve, are the only representations of the DC comic book. What's the first thing you read about new Supes Brandon Routh, what's the first thing people had to say about him? \\"Oh, he looks JUST like Christopher Reeve!\\" SO WHAT? Why is it so essential to stay fixated on those movies? Why do we never hear references made to the Kirk Alyn Superman? Or George Reeves, who (arguably) made an even bigger impact in the tights than his similarly named counterpart?<br /><br />But I digress. So, Superman Returns, then. Taken five years after Superman II (with Superman 3 and 4 being nixed from continuity - hmmm, messing around with continuity and carelessly discarding what's come before it? Yup, it's based on a DC comic, alright), we find that, for no real reason, Superman flew away for five years and let Lois Lane grow both more attractive and several years younger. That was nice of him. And wouldn't you know it, he's not back five minutes and already Lois is in dire peril - how did she survive all this time without him?<br /><br />While we're on the subject of Superman III and IV being wiped out because they were, well, crap, let's get one thing straight; the entire Superman FRANCHISE, including those holier than thou first two movies, aren't exactly perfect either. There are dozens of howlers in those movies, from Superman flying around the world so fast he turns back time (um, why not just do that for EVERYTHING bad that happens?), to Superman kissing Lois and WIPING HER MEMORY (it's Rohypnol Man!). Are we to pretend those things didn't happen as well?<br /><br />Anyway, in this one, what follows is a plot so ludicrous and half-baked you often wonder whether you should laugh or feel insulted. True, Superman is the most boring, two-dimensional character in comics, but even he deserves a better story than this. Spacey, a great actor, thinks hamming it up and yelling is all you need to be a great villain (if we're going to be obsessed with the 70s films, Gene Hackman was a much, much better Luthor), the chemistry between Lois and Clark is non-existent, and let's get to the REAL one-fingered salute to the fans, the franchise and the comic books themselves. If you want to avoid spoilers, look away now..<br /><br />Lois has a son from \\"another guy.\\" Who, after playing piano with the nicest kidnapper in the world, suddenly reveals he has SUPER POWERS TOO. That's right - it's actually Superman's son! Not only would this be a biological impossibility, (wouldn't Clark's Super Sperm, just, you know, blast right through Lois?) but it also kills the entire series STONE DEAD. So, what, are we going to have SuperBoy in the next film (and make no mistake about it, Superman Returns is an obvious attempt at a franchise starter)? So we're basically going to ignore decades of continuity and just make stuff up for no reason?<br /><br />And then there's the fact that Superman isn't exactly, well, Super in this film to begin with. Yeah, he does some (nice looking) stuff like catching airplanes and having bullets bounce off his eyeballs, but when it really comes down to it, all he does it sulk, pick things up, and then get the snot beaten out of him by Luthor. Um.. awesome.<br /><br />It's a mess. A boring, pretentious, worthy mess.

B0000E64TR|5.0|As the title says, this is one of the best rock albums ever.  It's up there with Physical Graphitti, Dark Side of the Moon, Boston, etc.  Highly recommended for the classic rock fan.
B000001DTM|5.0|Out of my whole U2 collection, I'd have to say this is my favorite one. U2 is a band that comes out with albums that never sound the same, but you know it's them. I love this album because it was an area U2 never explored as far as modern rock. Just like Bono said on the \\"Achtung Baby\\" Video, it's the most serious album with the least sounding title.<br />  I love the whole allum, but \\"One\\", \\"The Fly\\", and \\"Ultra Violet\\" are my favorite tracks. Just like any other album they came out with, all 4 band members shine through with they're playing skills. I'm so glad the always do \\"One\\" when in concert. This is A MUST album to get for any U2 fan. I love this album so much, I can never get sick of it!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Well, I posted a review for The Next Generation telling people that deepdiscount.com had TNG for a significantly lower price and now the prices match mostly... So I'll say this: The Original Series is 139.58. Hopefully Amazon will price match it as I prefer Amazon, but have to go with the cheapest price.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I really liked this movie but the truth is I wish I could get it on Blu-Ray! I thought the movie was very well done and offered a nice conclusion to the series cliffhanger.    I am very much looking forward to the next movie in the series: Continuum. That one is slated for release on Blu-Ray and I have already placed my pre-order for it!    This movie is an absolute must-have for SG-1 fans.

B000WCBPOG|4.0|I first saw this movie in April of 2008 (not sure how I missed it when it was in the theater), and was blown away by it.  I love all the renditions of classic Beatles' songs.  The soundtrack, like the movie, evokes such a range of emotions and stands out in the mind as one of those movies you'll never forget (and like an album that keeps getting better with each listen).  It instantly became one of my top ten favorites.  If you're a child of the 60's, this will be a very enjoyable trip down memory lane as you revisit some great songs with an updated flair that does primo justice to the original songs while still making them palatable to a younger audience.  Brilliantly composed and arranged!  Two thumbs up and five stars for the arrangement and quality of presentation!    The album is sequenced in virtually the same order as the songs appear in the film (which I was very happy to see), with the exception of \\"Flying\\", which (in the movie) appears in the final credits.  This CD is also missing two great songs from the film; \\"I want You (She's So Heavy)\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\".  This is partly why the soundtrack earned a 4 star review from me instead of 5.    Apparently there is a 31 song version of this album out there so I would advise looking for that if you want the complete soundtrack.  \\"I Want You\\" was (arguably) one of the most memorable songs from the film and I can't fathom why they would leave it off the deluxe edition.    My only other minor disappointment with the soundtrack (also leading to my 4 star review) is the fact that some of the vocals are a little different from the movie versions, which is a slight disappointment.  For example, on \\"Hey Jude\\", (though the album version is extremely close to the movie version) I loved the harmony part of Jude's mother in the film, but on the soundtrack she is not there and her part is replaced by - I think it's - Jim Sturgess' voice.  It still sounds awesome (as Jim's voice is definitely cool), but Iwish they had kept it in total harmony with the film.  The guy playing the garbage cans is also absent from the track (not a big disappointment there, but if you're looking for a direct likeness to the film, just note that it's missing).  Also, on \\"I Want You\\", the soundtrack misses the strong part of the soldiers singing along with their synchronized marching steps, which was so dramatic in the film.  Without it, the song comes across as much softer on the CD.  BUMMER!  I really missed that in the album version (almost made me want to record it directly off the DVD).  Instead of the soldier's singing, it appears to be Dana Fuchs (Sadie) harmonizing the part.  Again, still sounds really cool (as I love Dana's powerful voice), but I still wish the movie version was there instead (and not to worry... T.V. Carpio's part is still there as it should be).    Aside from these minor drawbacks, the soundtrack is solid and definitely one of my new favorites.  I love Bono's performances of \\"Lucy in the Sky\\" and \\"I Am The Walrus\\".  The vocal sounds of the cast singing \\"Because\\" even top the Beatles in my opinion.  It's beautiful!  \\"I Get By With A Little Help From My Friends\\" also blows the Beatles' version away in my opinion.  \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" follows the original quite well and sounds great.  In fact, all of these songs are excellent arrangements, dare I say BETTER than the originals that they were inspired from - but some will certainly argue that point with me.  I dug the originals but I love these new versions.  The updated versions do not deviate from the original melodies and virtually all of the familiar components of the songs are there with only some slight modifications to the background arrangements.  Whether your a Beatles fan or not, this is a great CD!  There's enough solid likeness to the original songs for fans of those originals, but for those of a younger generation who are perhaps unfamiliar with them these are definitely pleasing to the ear and will keep those classics alive for years to come!    GREAT CD!!!  Worth purchasing, though my only advice is to try and find the 31 song edition with \\"I Want You\\" and \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\".  Be advised, this Amazon-sold edition is missing those two great sounding songs.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|The TV show Firefly got cut too early in it's exciting career, being nominated for several awards and spawning hundreds of thousands of fans, the network cancelled the series before the first season was even completed.  Luckily, Joss was able to get a motion picture done for the fans, Serenity.    No, it's not Star Wars but Serenity is rated as one of the best modern day sci-fi films.  The battle / fight scenes are great, the special effects are excellent, and the story keeps you hanging on thoughout the film.    Every year \\"Can't Stop The Serenity\\" shows this movies in theatres across the US for charity benefits.  If you can, catch it in the theatre also but this DVD is a must for the sci-fi fan.
B0015D3Z4O|4.0|This is my first ever Madonna studio album purchase. We have her other albums here in the household but I did not buy them.    I bought her Confessions Tour CD+DVD album and that's what made me more interested with her. So when she finally released Hard Candy, I wanted to buy it so badly.    I have mixed feelings about Justin Timberlake. Some of his music sounds good to me, but others were just repetitive and annoying. So when Madonna teamed up with him (and Timbaland) for the single 4 Minutes, I was filled with mixed reaction. The song was catchy as hell and good despite Justin having his participation on the song. Still I thought to give the album a chance.    Despite the tacky and cheap-looking cover and booklet, I loved the CD after the first listen. Gone are the songs about the meaning of life, heartbreaks, and clever lyrics in this album. But I think Madonna was aiming more for a dance record with an urban feel and simple lyrics.    Each song is danceable, from the Pharell-penned opener Candy Shop to the Timberlake-written Voices that closes the album. I feel that songs which Pharell worked on are more superior than the others.    Standout tracks are Heartbeat, Miles Away, She's Not Me, Candy Shop, Give It 2 Me, Devil Wouldn't Recognize You, and Voices.    4 Minutes sounds weaker compared to the rest despite it being a good song. And Kanye West makes an uneventful appearance on Beat Goes On.    Despite the few slips and slides Hard Candy is a good album full of dance hits, and a reminder of the early Madonna.
0446677450|5.0|This is the first book that I read that showed me the difference between how the rich look at money, investing and life style vs. the rest of the population. Though lots of effort and hard work I have been able to implement many of the ideas in the book; I am always looking for ways to increase my cash flow.

006135323X|5.0|I am an exec in a medium to large sized company and I found Dan's book engaging, accurate and useful to my business. Behaviorial ecconomics is the new black. There is too little science in modern marketing books which is why my colleagues and I are skeptical of their efficacy and prefer this genre. This book takes an analytical approach to a field prone to pseudo sciences and puts well reasoned arguments to questions of behavior in marketing. It is also a funny book, I would have loved to have been one of his students.
B000006045|4.0|Didn't know this group from Adam.  Bought it for just the low bass to test out my speakers and new subwoofer.  Has some catchy tunes, not a bad CD.
B000077VR3|5.0|This is by far one of the best \\"rock operas\\" ever made (up there with Tommy and Yellow Submarine).  The writers for this film did an incredible job of combining songs together that normally wouldn't (like \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\") along with visually stimulating costumes and sets and people you wouldn't expect to sing, singing (Ewan McGreggor and Nicole Kidman).
0740748475|5.0|Bill Watterson managed in a relatively short time to fulfill something few cartoonist do in their entire careers: to create 2 classic an enternal characters, worthy of a place of honor in the Pantheon of comic strips, right along the Peanuts gang & Garfield.    And then, when he felt he had accomplished the goal set for himself, and had nothing left to prove to anyone, Watterson decided to say good-bye to his beloved hyper-active 6-year old & his inseparable feline accomplice just when they were at the top of their game; free to continue their amazing adventures fueled by the inexhaustible imagination of Calvin, their fantasy world unlimited except for when it's time to go to bed or finish homework--and sometimes not even then!    In this beautifully-crafted box collection resides the entirety of Calvin & Hobbes, from the very first strips that appeared on newspapers in 1986, to the very last sledding trip they took to explore their \\"magical world\\".    Now I know what some of you may be thinking, because I had the same doubts: \\"sure they look nice, but IS IT WORTH IT?\\". Well, in this humble enthusiast's opinion, the answer is a rotund \\"yes!\\".    For starters these books are HUGE. They let you focus on every tiny detail Watterson drew, inked and painted that made this strip stand out from the rest; all the attention and love he used to portray those wonderful dinosaurs, or the woods where Calvin & Hobbes spent so many idle hours together. In fact, the size of the books may be ironically the very single thing I may not like about them, but only because it is kind of uncomfortable to enjoy these jewels if you're already tucked in your bed! No, I recommend instead that you to choose a nice comfy armchair when perusing the alien landscapes of \\"Spaceman Spiff\\", or the heroic deeds of \\"Stupendous Man\\" fighting the evil \\"Mom Lady\\".    The quality of the paper is also of note, along with the printing that managed to capture all the richness & subtleties of the watercolors Watterson enjoyed so much to apply in his work. The man truly believed in the art of his medium and felt his readers deserved nothing but the best of what could come out of him.    So overall I seriously urge you to consider the investment of acquiring this wonderful collection. These books are intended to last a lifetime, and will probably be a matter of protest between your future inheritors--unless of course, you end up deciding you want to be buried with them :-)
B0015D3YX6|5.0|Brilliant reissue, even better than the 2001 reissue. This one adds the previously-unreleased \\"alternate mix\\" of the entire album, which is pretty excellent. Certain instruments stick out more in the mix; it's a bit rougher, more intimate -- definitely a worthwhile listen. The bonus tracks that weren't on the 2001 reissue are alright, not terribly necessary. The ONE THING that is missing from this reissue is the FULL LENGTH VERSION of \\"A House Is Not A Motel\\". There exists a version in which the Echols twin-guitar solo goes on a good 20 or 30 seconds longer than the original album version. However, this lack is a tiny shortcoming. The reissue as pressed is still a five star release.
0060899220|4.0|Kitchen Confidential is a brash, entertaining, and funny look at life behind the scenes in restaurants. The book is a combination of expose, biography, and blunt advice for those interested in working in the restaurant industry.    Bourdain is a talented raconteur and a gifted writer. Some of his prose is hard to resist. For instance (on page 197), he describes the dinner tasting, where waiters at his restaurant sample the evening's food; the waiters \\"...fall on the family gruel and tasting plates like rabid jackals... They tear at the four plates of food, ripping apart the pheasant with their hands, nearly spearing each other with forks as they gouge at the tuna, drag cockles to their greasy maws with bare hands and quickly turn Janine's lovely tarte into a dark smear.\\" It is difficult not to like a book that has a talented writer telling a good story.    Kitchen Confidential also features dozens of great characters. There is the Manhattan restaurateur Bourdain calls Bigfoot; a hulking former college basketball player with a talent for squeezing every nickel out of his restaurant. There is Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, a dysfunctional man who loses every job he takes. After each firing, Adam promptly gets another job because of his special talent for making delicious bread. There is also Bourdain: witty, profane, cocky, knowledgeable, and opinionated.    If there is a downside to Kitchen Confidential it is the fact that Bourdain's world is very seedy, profane, and, in many ways, deeply repellent; the reader becomes weary after a while. Bourdain's boastful descriptions of his profane tirades and drug addiction are particularly unappealing. The locker room atmosphere in which Bourdain chooses to work (no profanity is too vile or too explicit) is sophomoric. At its worst, Bourdain's world makes you feel as though you need a long, cleansing bath.    In spite of its problems, Kitchen Confidential allows the reader to journey to a world that he or she probably knows nothing about. It is a very entertaining book.
0446677450|1.0|The book does inspire, but much of it is just fantasy. If it was that easy to make money, there would be a lot more people out there. The book offers dangerous advice. BEWARE. It is not worth reading.
B00008A7QK|5.0|I've always liked Bolan's songs but have previously only had compilations. Even though I like most of the songs on these collections I rarely played them because as often happens the songs did not fit together well for me.  EW works really well as a whole and is a great listen in its entirety. I have listened to it loud and it ROCKS, then at lesser volume it works well too, with Bolans vocal stylings coming over well. This is a real 'album' that fits together so well with each song complimenting the others and while there is a definite overall sound there is also great variety within it. Interested in T.Rex? Start here. TIP Burn a disc without the extra tracks (burn them onto a separate disc if you like) as the album as it originally stood needs no adornment good though the additions are.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh Groban's Awake Live is nothing short of amazing! His powerhouse voice will give you chills and goosebumps, and the passion with which he sings will bring you to tears!

This is absolutely a must have! I own six copies!

B000BB1MI2|4.0|After reading a number of negative reviews on the web by 'movie critiques', I stayed away from the film for years. Finally, I was channel surfin and locked into this movie.     Well, I really enjoyed the movie. Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka like Jim Carrey would. Somewhat exaggerated and silly, but very very funny. There were a number of comical scenes which made me giggle and there were enough of them to keep the viewer engaged (notice all the Umpa-loompas are the same guy--even the office lady!). Although, I have to say the scene of eating worms was totally uncalled for, especially for a children movie. One suggestion for improvement is adding closed captions for the lyrics sung by the Umpa-loompas. It was very hard to understand what they were saying.     While the old version by Wilder did not have too much psychology involved, this version had plenty of it. For example, we can better understand what motivated Willy Wonka to be the best Chocolatier in the world when he had flashbacks to his unhappy childhood. Also, the bratty children showed mature acting when they really oozed out vicious attitudes towards each other (competing to be selected by Wonka). Funny, a 10-year-old (?) kid displaying such competitive behavior and playing politics of backstabbing just like adults in the office. The movie seems to suggest the evilness of adults already start at the tender age of youth, unless they are well raised and educated to be a good person.
B0015UKX7Y|5.0|Last Shadow Puppets is a UK duo comprising Miles Kane of the Rascals, and Alex Turner of The Arctic Monkeys. Their album has already hit #1 in the UK and their lead off single \\"The age of the understatement\\" has hit the top 10 so I guess Alex has another band to fall back on should he have to give up the day job.<br /><br />Their sound is similar to that of the Monkeys (Arctic Monkeys, I mean) but less jagged, more mellow, and more symphonic, thanks to the presence of a 22 piece orchestra, resulting in lush pieces like the horn sprinkled beauty \\"Meeting place\\" or the almost jazzy \\"My mistakes were made for you\\".<br /><br />They also do upbeat very well; \\"The age of the understatement\\" and the theatrical \\"Only the truth\\" (with a horn-filled coda) both have a galloping feel and could fit into a Western epic, while \\"Seperate and ever deadly\\" has a marching band feel and raging guitars.<br /><br />Other standouts are the swinging \\"The chamber\\" (with a symphonic coda), the similar \\"Calm like you\\", the sunny, retro sounding \\"Standing next to me\\" and the closing tender acoustic ballad \\"The time has come again\\" with a dreamy sounding chorus.<br /><br />This is a very lovely album, think of it like a symphonic Arctic Monkeys.

078322611X|5.0|I just watched \\"Field of Dreams\\" for the very first time tonight on cable.  My Dad died this past November and for whatever reason, I felt compelled to watch this movie tonight.  Now after doing so, I know I will be ordering it from Amazon.com.  What a beautiful, moving movie this was!  People talk about it like it is about a son and his Dad.  But it can just as easily be about a daughter and her Dad ... like it was for me.  I remember when it first came out; I wasn't interested in seeing it as it was just a baseball movie.  I found out tonight that it is so very much more than just that.  Check it out and be sure to bring a big box of kleenex!

B00139XZF4|5.0|After being disappointed with several Blu-Ray titles and nearly regretting ever buying a player, this title excels with clarity that I demand. You really see the detail with the 1920x1080p resolution (on a 1920x1080 LCD). Every strand of hair and snow particle was absolutely clear (even when not in the center of the screen) and defeats the theatrical experience.     I saw this movie five times in theaters, but when I viewed this on Blu-Ray, I noticed two new details. They also perfectly cleaned up the 4-5 seconds of graininess of when Lyra enters the conference room at Jordan that was horrid in theaters. The only minor complaint I have is the added grain during the New Line golden company intro (the first 3 seconds). Any other grain during the film was absolutely minimum. That was surprising considering the numerous dark scenes.    The content of the movie itself is as amazing as it is charming. My girlfriend and I quote the movie all the time. We dread the possibility of the studios not doing the sequels. If they can complete the trilogy with the same quality as this one, I will hail it as the best trilogy ever. That's not a small feat as I defend the LOTR trilogy as the best thus far and likely the best in my lifetime.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is soooooo darn good....my teeth hurt.   Madonna again evolves...and stays with the times.   This album is very Urban and very Now.    It is like nothing she has done before and yes it is sticky and sweet.   Some of the usual haters have come out don't listen to them.  Get Madge's album it is fun and fresh, at least Madge is not afraid to try new things. Madge's album is really Hard Candy meaning it is sweet but with some of the most brillian lyrics she has ever written that are hard hitting.  Pick up a copy you will totally love it.    This album is smart pop at it's finest. Thanks Madge!!!!
0061474355|4.0|Sabriel looks forward to her father's rare visits to her boarding school in Ancelstierre, but when he fails to come during her final year, she knows something is wrong.  An important and powerful necromancer called the Abhorsen, her father has many enemies, and it is of dire consequence that he be rescued.  So Sabriel, along with two companions, sets off into the dark and terrifying Old Kingdom to find him, and on the way, she discovers the truth of her own destiny.<br /><br />Garth Nix's writing is impeccable, and he has a gift for description.  There are times when reading this book causes you to forget reality completely, so submersed are you in Nix's highly imaginative world.  However, the first three-quarters of the novel are lacking in tension that would have made the plot itself riveting -- parts of the novel are tedious, but not from excessive, flowery writing.  It is simply difficult to connect with the characters and the action.<br /><br />Having said this, readers who either are not troubled by this minor failing or who persevere will be fully satisfied by the ending, which is fantastically gripping.<br /><br />Over all, this novel is an astounding achievement, and will without doubt be enjoyed by adults as much as by teens.  It is the first of a trilogy.
B00003CXC7|5.0|Another great classic!  Grace has such style and class.  Jimmy Stewart is fantastic.  Great rolls for both of them and great chemistry!
157912626X|2.0|But I found her irritating in this book.  Overall I'd summarize it as a rather interesting, if dry, story. I was interested in the basic storyline, but the characters were utterly flat and did very little to peak my interest. I seemed to recall I used to like Agatha Christie, but that was a long time ago, back when I was...younger. I would say her story are okay for a quick, light read, but if you really want depth and good character development, steer clear.<br /><br />Also, Miss Marple doesn't hold a candle to Poirot!
B000BRIAUE|3.0|Weirdness reigns supreme. This is the one that separates the sane from the schizoid. You think you're up for the title track, a twenty-four minute pseudoclassical suite? Or \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", thirteen minutes of a roadie commenting on his breakfast? If the answer is \\"yes\\", then have a blast with this one. But if it's no... well, I suppose you can always keep it around to end parties you think have gone on a couple hours longer than necessary. In truth, I like bits of the title suite - Gilmour's blues guitar playing is fantastic whenever he chooses to whip it out, there are some cool organ sequences, and I like that part where the choir chants about random foods - but there ain't enough for twenty-four minutes, that's for sure. Actually, there's enough good material for five. And \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", other than the pretty classical guitar passage, is more or less a waste of time. But sandwiched between these two pieces are three actual, full-blown songs, and they're good! None of them are classics, but I like them! \\"If\\" rules in its acoustic introspective goodness; \\"Summer '68\\" is a solid Paul Simon imitation; and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" is a pretty good soft blues. Again, it's hard to love any of these three (other than maybe \\"If\\"), but they're certainly solid, likable, unpretentious material. If they had made an entire album out of songs like those three, now that could've really been something. Sadly... they screwed it up with the two psycho songs. Oh well.
B000005HLV|3.0|the music and atmosphere on this thing is very cool/cold/bleak/spooky/raw/snowy... however, i really think the vocals are very dumpy & hacked.  i like the review the one guy on here wrote that \\"the vocals sound like a homeless stoned bum kicking a can and making fun of black metal singers\\".  after hearing a demo/studio version of \\"freezing moon\\" w/ dead on vocals (off the nordic metal tribute cd) i have realized that if he hadn't killed himself & went through w/ doing the vocals on this record, it would've been one of the greatest black metal albums of all time.  period.  i'll settle for my burzum albums instead of this.  burzum is the greatest black metal force ever.

0451528018|2.0|I expected to find it a little dry, but overall likeable. Instead, I found the story a little too far to the supernatural, and Sherlock Holmes turned out to be one of the most unlikable characters I've read in a long time! I really felt for Watson, who did not come across as the dumb, stumbling sidekick. I had a hard time slogging through the book, and it didn't make me want to pick up any more Holmes anytime soon. I guess I expected a little more \\"Basil of Baker Street\\" from The Great Mouse Detective.
B000002UA5|5.0|Definitely the best album of Floyd's \\"transitional\\" period - that is, those few years after Syd left and before they really became Pink Floyd. This is also their first, and in my opinion best double-album. The first LP is live, and it's fantastic. \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\" is one of Floyd's best songs ever, a haunting, psychologically manipulative masterpiece that slowly, carefully builds its way to a blood-curdling peak. It'll make you feel that nine minutes is the perfect song length. This version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is good too, though the group sounds kind of bored singing it. Still, when they get to the jamming... whoa. Minds get blown. I'm pretty sure a lot of people baked pot brownies, cookies, and cakes and ate them while listening to these instrumental bits. And you know what? I've never so much as taken a bong hit in my life, but it's pretty clear to me that Dave and Rick especially had taken several before playing this song. Fans of the trippy will also appreciate the awesome synth noises found on this version of \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\". While the studio version of that song was, without question, the best song on A Saucerful of Secrets, I like this take more myself. It plays up on the Far East elements found in the original, and really gets intense as it goes along. And they turn \\"A Saurcerful of Secrets\\" itself fantastic, upping the emotional ante astronomically so it really does sound like a battle being fought and the aftermath of said battle. Best example of live Floyd in a second! The studio stuff isn't anywhere near as good, but it's still interesting. Basically, the group decided they'd give every group member half a side of material to do their thing. These sides are controversial, but I find them at times captivating. Wright's avant-garde keyboard solo \\"Sisyphus\\" is great, and the majestic, all-acoustic \\"Grantchester Meadows\\" blows me away. Its lyrics are simple, but laden with evocative imagery of a meadow by Cambridge University. And \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered In a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\\" is funny! Yes, it is pretty avant-garde. Meanwhile, Gilmour plays some solo acoustic that could put Steve Howe to shame on the first part of \\"The Narrow Way\\", though the weird noises are rather distracting. They hadn't quite gotten good with weird noises yet, see. That would come later. The second part is an interesting proto-industrial guitar solo, and the trippy third has odd lyrics. As for Mason, he contributes the unique percussion showcase \\"Grand Vizier's Garden Party\\", and like the rest of the album it's unlike anything else you'll ever hear in your life. This is a fantastic album. Not recommended for starting fans, that's for sure, but it definitely is worthy of investigation. By the way, \\"ummagumma\\" is supposedly Cambridge slang for \\"sex\\".

B00006EXL5|5.0|I bought this cd last summer and am still enjoying its content.   This cd is wonderful for people who like hard fast rock, and want something interesting to listen to. It has interesting, deep lyrics that will leave you with much to think about long after you listen to it. I wouldn't recommend this cd for someone who was attracted to My Chemical Romance's music because of The Black Parade, because the styles are very, very different. However, I would recommend it for people who were attracted to them by Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, because the style of the music is much more similar. This is an awesome cd and it will keep you entertained for months.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|Well considering that I don't have the product it will be pretty hard to review it.  This would be the third time I have written you regarding the fact that I paid $120+ for two copies of Planet Earth on DVD, and I STILL DON\\"T HAVE THEM!!!!!!!!!!  Is there no one there?  Is there a human at the other end of this computer who could possibly send me my two copies of Planet Earth on  DVD.  You really don't want my review of your service at this point!    Thank You
0646418432|4.0|The plucky little Belgian is in fine form in this old-fashioned whodunit, gleaning clues where there seem to be none.  Unlike other Agatha Christie mysteries, I'm not sure the reader is really given all of the information to be able to deduce the solution themselves.  You could guess, true, (though I did not) but there weren't the concrete clues left lying about for the reader to grasp and assemble into a coherent scenario.  Still, it was an enjoyable old-fashioned mystery, and I would recommend the Poirot stories to all mystery fans (Miss Marple, on the other hand, grates on my nerves).
B0010358EE|5.0|If you saw the original Apleseed, you will definitely enjoy its sequel, Ex Machina.  The characters are back in unbelievable visual and audio quality.  Excellent plot as well; highly enjoyable to any anime/sci-fi fan!    Now that HD-DVD is going the way of the dodo, you can get a great deal on this movie if you already own a player.
B0011ZNAIC|2.0|As much as I love Jerry Seinfeld's jokes, this movie is flat-out disappointing. It's really fun to see a bee talk to humans in \\"Bee Movie,\\" but something in the interaction goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />First of all, the movie tries to show a romance between a bee and a woman. It gets even weirder when the woman has a human boyfriend. Okay, maybe it's interesting to have those relations with humans, but it just seems weird to think about those things when the main characters have different physiologies.<br /><br />Second, near the end of the movie, the touching ending gets way too overblown and unrealistic. Think about it--a humongous batch of flowers to save the world from a lack of food. Bees saving the airplane carrying the batch of flowers. Sorry, the bees carried it to the airport. Somehow they developed superhuman strength. I don't understand how on Earth this is supposed to happen.<br /><br />Worse still, the film gets ridiculous with the court scene between the bees and the human corporations. I like Seinfeld's jokes, but are humans really going to take bees seriously? They're bees. They can be squashed by humans. In fact, they get sprayed too. And they die in court. Isn't there something completely wrong with this?<br /><br />This is a confusing movie that is supposed to teach kids about the importance of globalization. Globalization. The sharing of resources among nations. Kids are really not going to understand the message of this movie. \\"Bee Movie\\" really could have been like \\"Ratatouille,\\" which was a story about a rat becoming a star, even though he was a hated pest by humans. Instead, \\"Bee Movie\\" falls flat on its face with too many problems. Do kids a favor and show them \\"Ratatouille\\" instead.
0143039830|5.0|This is the first book that I read by Paul Auster.  I had heard of him for years, but I always assumed that he was another New York Writer.  In order words, stuffy and primarily writing for \\"intellectuals\\" and the Pulitzer Prize or the National Book Award. I could not have been more wrong.  These three loosely connected short works contain some of the most gut-wrenching emotional writing that I have laid eyes on.  It hit me almost as hard as John Steinbecks \\"East of Eden\\".  Don't get me wrong, these books have nothing in common other than a willingness on the part of both authors to let dark things come to the surface and then not just explain them away.  (Actually, there is a bit of self reference in Steinbeck's book as well, but it is merely a mention and not the intense existential experience that Auster's book is.  Anyway, this is merely an aside.)  Auster's Trilogy takes the form of detective stories, but this is only the most rudimentary framework for these incredibly powerful explorations into the nature of identity and the disappearance of one's self or the many selves that one man possesses.  I'm not going to tell anything about the plot, but suffice it to say that this stuff is pretty dark.  Don't be fooled by the cartoonish cover (done by Art Spiegelman of \\"Maus\\" fame), this is not a fun genre exercise.  It is art.
0312330871|3.0|This book came free with the PC game of the same name (it was originally titled Ten Little Indians) and even though playing the game (specifically, playing the end trailer) does give away the mystery, it was still a good solid read.  Though you don't see as much into each of the characters as you might expect, I don't think story is hurt by it.  I hesitate to say that it's not a character driven story, because in a way it really is, but the main focus is how the characters interact with one another - not... who they are on the inside, if that makes sense.  And though I disagree with a lot of the utterly sexist clap-trap spouted in the book by the male characters, well, you have to remember that it's a much older book!  Times have indeed changed.  I wouldn't say this tops my list of Agatha Christie books, but it's not bad.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|As soon as I heard the song 'Love Song', I had to find out who sang it, & buy her cd.  Sarah Bareilles is an amazing talent, & the cd is one of the best I've ever found.  I love finding true 'artists' - in addition to her unique voice, she writes her own music & plays the piano.  The cd is a great mix of fun songs & bluesy sad songs.  My favorite is still 'Love Song', but I also love 'Fairy Tales', & honestly, I love the rest of the songs too.  I can't wait to see her as the opening act with Maroon 5 & Counting Crows in Jones Beach in July!
0446691437|5.0|I am probably the last person on Earth to read, let alone praise a \\"you can do it\\", \\"just try your best\\" self-help book. But this one surprised me.<br /><br />The author clearly has faced down the demons of doubt and distraction that plague most aspiring writers. I was shocked by how much of the book rang true for me.<br /><br />This is an excellent work that just might help get you off your feet and on your butt so you can finally get some writing done. It certainly helped me. I'm a published author now and I have to give a little bit of the credit to this fine book that I might have arrogantly condemned (without reading) once upon a time.<br /><br />The text is tight so it's a quick read. At times the author gets a bit too hocus pocus for my tastes, but that's okay. He makes strong points and offers invaluable advice.<br /><br />Read it and start writing, today!<br /><br />Guy P.

B000IJ79V6|5.0|You can probably count on your fingers the number of movie series (comic book or not) where the second movie holds up completely to the original. (Star Trek II, T2, Spider-man 2, X2, The Rescuers Down Under, etc.) It can be debated as to whether Superman II outshines the original, but what can't be debated is the fact that it is at least in the same league as the original, whichever one you may personally feel is above the other. That's something that can't be said of the third movie. And it's just insulting to try to compare Superman IV to any of the others at all.<br /><br />Of course, even if you do feel, as many do, that this one is a better movie than Superman: The Movie, you have to acknowledge that it wouldn't be that way without the first one. It relies too heavily on the first movie, as a continuation of certain plot points introduced there. Not the least of which is the introduction and imprisonment of the Zod Squad.<br /><br />In fact, both scripts were developed at the same time and the movies were being shot concurrently. In fact, after the first movie came out and Richard Donner was fired as director (long story) and they brought in Richard Lester to finish up (and reshoot a few scenes) Gene Hackman never actually worked with Richard Lester. All of his scenes were shot before Donner was booted.<br /><br />Terrence Stamp is perfect as Zod. He creates a wonderfully ominous air about him. You can easily see how tiring it is to Zod to have to reassert his superiority every time these piddly little humans try to fight back. His restraint makes the character forebodingly threatening, since you never know just when he will snap and show his full power. That's refreshing to see in an age of so many over-the-top villains.
B00132D808|4.0|Let me start by saying that I never played \\"Fever\\" in heavy rotation.  However, I (like many Panic! fans) loved the wit, danceable rhythyms, and crunching guitar from the last album.  Certain tracks from that album, namely \\"Time to Dance,\\" \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies,\\" and \\"Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks\\" are still in my 25 most played songs list.  Regardless, I love the fact that the band has fresh, new material to offer.  This album is basically the band's second breakthrough, and I couldn't be happier with the direction the band has taken.    Simply put, \\"Fever\\" was NOT as original or musically complex as many have claimed it to be.  A solid album, but Panic!s distinct sound became muddied when played next to similar bands like Fall Out Boy, All-American Rejects, other \\"emo-punk\\" acts of 2005-2006, etc.  With the release of \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" the band has shown that they are capable of versatile musicianship and superior songwriting, something entirely different from the wildly commercial success of \\"Fever.\\"    This album will undoubtedly confuse or disappoint die-hard \\"Fever\\" fans at first.  Trust me, I had to force myself to listen to the album about 5 times through before I could accept its uniqueness.  There is simply not another contemporary album out now that sounds like it.  If you give the album some time, and listen to the songs for what they are worth, it just might grow on you (that's a note for Panic-haters from the last album, also!) .    \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" is an excellent single to transition into the new sound.  It sounds almost like the more jangly, swinging tracks from \\"Fever\\" (\\"But It's Better If You Do\\") with a hint of 60s psychedelia thrown in for good measure.    \\"Behind the Sea\\" definitely represents the \\"Odd\\" of the album, but has a Beatlesque charm to it (lyrics like \\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,\\" vocals meander like McCartney singing \\"Lovely Rita\\").  Make no mistake, this is a catchy song, and stands out among the rest for theuse of its eclecticism.    \\"Northern Downpour.\\"  Wow, where do I begin?  This is easily the most frequently played song in my library over the course of the last 5 weeks.  I started out listening to it 6-8 times a day and could not get enough of it.  Now when I play it, I can't help but sing along: the lyrics are gold, clever and touching.  The complementing acoustic chords, and subsequent piano are exactly the right support to the vocals.  By the time the second verse kicks in, melody is attacking your ears from at least six different directions as the electric guitar joins in to pay homage to George Harrison's background-harmony-riffing.  Toward the end of the song, it's impossible not to sing with the chorus: \\"Hey moon, please forget to fall down / Hey moon, don't you go down.\\"    Only one thing kept me from giving this album 5 stars: all of the songs are so different from each other that they sound like they may as well be  pulled off of a greatest hits album.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but for picky fans like myself a little bit of album cohesion is appreciated. I like songs to flow together, and I like not having to skip tracks that I feel are weaker than others.  A little bit of personal preference there, and surely not enough to discredit the originality (dare I say \\"classic\\" status) of the album.    Long story short, \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" is not \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"  It's not even close.  It's a whole different style, a whole different genre, and a whole new maturity for the band.  Bands evolve, sounds evolve.  There is no music industry rule that says a band must stick to their old-school sound.  Panic at the Disco have completely surprised me, and everyone that I recommend the album to.  Think and listen beyond past prejudices here: this is a fresh start, and the only way to appreciate the music is to accept the new direction that the band is taking.  Personally, I would be just as happy if this was Panic at the Disco's breakthrough debut, instead of \\"Fever.\\"  And in a way, it is.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I received a copy as a gift today, and I wish I could exchange it like I would a bad tie. I am giving Madonna two stars for having the \\"ba**s\\" to release something this vapid and mediocre. It's tuneless machine driven crapola worsened by the involvement of the overrated Justin Timberlake and whiner no talent Kanye West,who don't understand what made Madonna popular in the first place. Madonna is trying to appeal to kids and keep up with artists 30 years her junior...why? She has nothing left to prove. I love Madonna, but this album is borderline self-humiliation and parody. The songs are so meandering and boring that one may speculate that  Madonna couldn't afford to hire some good songwriters,or perhaps doesn't care since this release fulfills the contract with her current her record company...she should have gone out with a bang instead of a whimper.
B00005AG7K|1.0|If you have an old VHS or DVD from the movie of the Beatles \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\", keep it with you. Certainly it must be better than this one for sale on Amazon Web site.   I say that because I have an ancient version from the middle of the 90's that I supposed it needed an upgrade. So I decided to buy this  \\"remastered-release\\". It's simply awful, the picture is dirty and fuzzy. In addition, there's no subtitle nor special bonus on the menu. I really don't understand how Amazon can sell a product so bad like that and the Apple Corporation allows exposing the image of The Beatles with no control over the quality.   So, if you haven't bought yet the Magical Mystery Tour DVD, don't do it now. Wait at least until there's an official release like Help and A Hard day's night DVDs. Avoid this pirated copy. By the way, is it permitted in the USA?
B000J10EQU|5.0|Finally, a return not only of the man of steel, but of movie makers who know what makes a superman movie great. No more billionaire Luthor wannabes. No more lame solar-powered superman clones. No more women getting inexplicably assimilated with silver circuit boards all over their faces. This is just a good-old-fashioned Superman adventure with a little humor, a little sexual tension and a whole lot of Superman doing what he does best.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is a bit heavy on the soap opera at times, but that is mainly because they have to be sure to re-introduce the characters to a movie-going audience that hasn't seen them on the big screen in 19 years. And not in a *good* movie for 26. But even with the soap-opera aspects present, this is a great follow-up to the first two movies, conveniently pretending that Supermans III and IV never happened. (As do many of the fans.)<br /><br />Spacey is wonderful as Lex Luthor. Gene Hackman played up Luthor's charisma and self-importance superbly. Spacey, however, creates a Luthor that can truly scare you with a glance.<br /><br />Superb movie, and I can't wait for the follow-up.
B000002KHY|4.0|James Taylor Greatest Hits is a good retrospective even though at twelve songs I think it's a bit too short. They should have added a song or two; but what we do get is excellent material. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is tastefully done.<br /><br />\\"Something In The Way She Moves\\" has a very pretty melody and the guitar and James' singing carry the bulk of the melody. This song is a sweet one that has traces of folk music in it; and the string instruments are very well placed into the musical arrangement. \\"Carolina In My Mind\\" features James Taylor front and center--and that's OK with me! The melody is very solid and James sings this with all his heart and soul. Excellent! James' voice is very rich and full of masculine warmth; his uncanny sense of timing enhances his performance even further.<br /><br />\\"Fire And Rain\\" tugs at my heartstrings whenever I hear this torch song; it's all very beautiful and James sings this passionately. James carries this tune well and the piano works well for this love ballad. \\"Country Road\\" again places James right in the spotlight--and he doesn't waste a minuet! James delivers \\"Country Road\\" with panache and this impresses me greatly. The slight twist of folk and country music elements enhances the natural beauty of \\"Country Road.\\"<br /><br />\\"You've Got A Friend\\" is probably my very favorite song on this CD; James delivers this flawlessly and the emotion again tugs at my heartstrings because James sings of unconditional and undying love and friendship. The guitar carries the melody well but the other instruments help out, too. James also handles tempo changes effortlessly--although we know that it really wasn't so easy; James could make it seem easy because he is so talented.<br /><br />\\"How Sweet It Is (To be Loved By You)\\" has a pop music flavor to it; and I can never tire of hearing James Taylor singing this fine tune! The melody stuns me with its beauty and there's no wonder why this was a huge hit for James. Great! \\"How Sweet It Is (To be Loved By You)\\" is clearly a major highlight of this album. In addition, James Taylor does a great job on \\"Shower The People;\\" this touching love song stresses the importance of showing your special people just how much you really love them.<br /><br />The CD also ends very strong with James Taylor performing \\"Steamroller.\\" \\"Steamroller\\" is a live track that James carries perfectly and his adoring audience loves every minute of it!<br /><br />James Taylor fans will want this CD if they don't already have these songs in their collections. Because this album is so short it may be best suited for the casual fan who doesn't care to delve too deep into James Taylor's work. I have to take off one and ½ stars to make this a three and ½ star review because the CD is just too short to be called a \\"greatest hits\\" collection.To be Loved By You)\\" is clearly a major highlight of this album.

B00139B39E|5.0|First, I have to comment on another review that I read. They basically say that a compilation like this doesn't do the music justice because it takes away from the story of the full albums. Would you then say that when DT plays a concert they should only play sets that are put together like a full record? No... it's about hearing the different songs that you love from one of the greatest bands ever!!   That being said, I would have liked to have seen this include such songs as \\"The Mirror\\", \\"Burning My Soul\\", \\"Take Away My Pain\\", \\"The Way It Used To Be\\", \\"Under A Glass Moon\\", \\"Blind Faith\\", \\"Constant Motion\\", \\"This Dying Soul\\" and maybe even the previously released live versions of \\"Fortune In Lies\\" and \\"Another Hand - The Killing Hand\\"   But I guess we can't have it all. A collection of all b-sides and unreleased songs would be a nice treat though!!!  Overall, it's still 5 stars. There's not a single bad song on there.
B000059Z8J|5.0|You would be hard pressed to come up with a better introduction of Superman to the big screen. Under the direction of Richard Donner, Superman flies not only on film, but in our imaginations. This is not the first attempt at a live-action Superman, and it is far from the last, but with a lot of work, it was the first realistic portrayal of the man of steel's powers. They knew going in that sub-par effects work would kill the magic of this movie, which is why they spent more R&D on making Superman fly than on any other single element of the movie. In the end, the tag line in the advertising boiled it down succinctly: You will believe a man can fly.<br /><br />Superman speaks to the most basic part of the human imagination. He is what we all wish we could be, both in body and in spirit. He is perfectly good as well as perfectly formed. But if we couldn't believe in his powers, we would never be able to be pulled completely into the fantasy.<br /><br />A perfect hero, however, requires a perfect villain. Gene Hackman brings the right amount of charisma to the cruel and villainous Lex Luthor. You know he is planning the deaths of millions, but there is a part of you that almost roots for him because you just love to watch him berate his underlings.
0375420525|5.0|This book, if you'll let it, will consume you. I still have trouble staying inside sometimes (I finished the book about a month ago), and if I think about it enough, I'll get chills.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|**Warning - May Contain Spoilers**<br />This is a great thing for anyone who considers themselves a student of film making. This is an alternate edit of the classic second movie in the Superman franchise.<br /><br />Now don't get the wrong idea about this version. Just because it is labeled \\"The Richard Donner Cut\\" does not mean that this is the way the movie would have looked had Donner not been fired after shooting roughly 75% of this movie. There would clearly have been some changes made. For instance, the scene where Lois forces Superman to reveal his identity  was never actually shot for the move in this way. The footage they use here is from Margot Kidder's screen test for the original movie which was done in one camera shot originally. By interspersing reaction shots from Christopher Reeve that were taken from other actress' screen tests, they are able to create a more polished feel, but they are unable to do much more than that. (They had the scripts for both movies from the beginning and had actors try out with scenes from both.)<br /><br />Another big complaint that many have regarding this movie is the ending. It comes off as too repetitive after what happened in the first movie. The fact is that the \\"turning back time\\" ending was originally intended for the end of the second movie, but was placed at the end of the first one instead. Donner did not get the chance to shoot the kind of ending he would have wanted once the original ending was moved. Had he been able to finish the movie, he would have doubtless had something else entirely.<br /><br />But it is refreshing to see how two people can take such different approaches to the same basic concept.<br /><br />If you get this, be sure to watch the special features where Donner explains a little about why he made many of the decisions that are shown in this version of the movie.
0425188809|5.0|The cutest most intelligent dog you could imagine. The most relentlessly vicious mutant monster. And the monster that created them both. Add some average people and it makes for quite a story.    Some 20 years ago this book helped to turn me twards Libertarianism. Thanks Mr. Koontz.
B000S0GYRU|1.0|I just finished watching this movie 5 minutes ago, and without a doubt it is the worst horror movie I have ever seen.  How can ANYBODY find this movie interesting?  Let's ignore for a minute that the special effects were awful and that the acting was terrible.  There's so much wrong with this movie, I don't want people to discount my criticism simply due to the era in which the movie was made.  The plot was fragmented, choppy, and unbelievable.  The characters were stale and uninteresting.  And that damn song they use to build suspense was more overplayed than the Macarena.    I found myself laughing through 80% of the movie.    Save your money people.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Lots of bugs, monsters and acting. The best I've seen this year. The plot moved along quite well. The book translated well to screen and all the actors were believable. Not predictable and kept me wondering how the hero would save his followers.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I'll forgo reviewing the actual movie since it's been covered adequately by now.  After viewing the special features, I can't recommend watching them.  The alternate ending is not significantly different from the theatrical ending.  The deleted scenes did not reveal anything and were not that entertaining.  The commentary is absolutely painful.  The director blathers on and on about how the handi-cam made this and that possible.  And then continues to say this every few seconds.  It would have been nice to actually hear a commentary on the events that are happening, otherwise, he could have just released a podcast.      Watch the movie and forget about everything else on the disc.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Sorry, this movie had all the trapping for a good sci-fi, but fell flat on it's face. We fast forwarded through most of it to catch glimpses of the monster, which was really good when it was visible. Filmed like \\"Blaire Witch Project\\", we are forced to watch a group of bumbling idiots being recorded by a person with a nervous disorder. Over and over, we are forced to watch as the actors scurry away from the monster, not watch the monster. Each scene is drawn out to boredom.
B000JIHP88|5.0|We just love this mobile, and baby does too.  I love how it not only spins but the leaves go up and down.  The rain forest sounds are adorable too.  It was a breeze to set up and attach to the crib.  The only two negatives about this mobile is that it has about a 10 minute timer and then it shuts off which I wish you could change or at least make it stay on a bit longer than that.  The other thing is that our baby also has a Fischer Price aquarium attached to her crib and when using the remote it turns that aquarium on and off instead of the mobile!

0743216458|5.0|One of those books; I can't seem to put down. I'm thankful I have watched the movie, Band of Brothers, for I could \\"picture\\" everything that was happening though all these pages. This Regiment was truly remarkably determined and proud to be a participant in this long relentless war. How do you understand anything, unless you were there and have gone through all the circumstances? There are so many things we don't realize or understand and this book almost took you there to see what they had to experience. To be so proud and honored is an understatement for men like these and for all of our Military.
B000F4LPJ6|5.0|This film is to be described as the single most groundbreaking film in the history of Chinese cinema, and as I'm sure that many of your heads just exploded, because you believe this to be a Japanese film.  Well let me tell you it's not.  I'm Chinese and I know things, I know many things about China and our history, and this actually happened in China.  That's why it's such an important film for our country.  We've erased this from our history but it's good to have a retelling of the sweet past in which children roamed the streets like dewdrops and sugarlillies.
031286504X|4.0|Great content, the story is fantastic, but short.  Don't spend a lot of money on the book because you will have finished reading it in a couple of days!  Definitely worth reading.
B0016HNOXQ|3.0|I simply dont understand why they went with a lo-fi sound when they can produce amazing beats to complement the vocals really well.  This album perposely makes speakers/headphones crackle, and it just doesn't sound good.  I can understand minimalism, but at least make it sound crisp.        That said the album is made Portishead, so it still manages to be good, it's just you cant compare it to the production masterpieces that are the first two albums.  Standouts include Silence, The Rip, Machine Gun, and Magic Doors.
0061245097|5.0|This book is even better than the first book and I hope another one will be released soon.
B000001FTJ|5.0|I used to love this album in the late 80s and early 90s, but recently started listening to it again after a long hiatus (my wife hates TW, it ended up).  Let me say this album is something of a minor miracle.  It's hard to describe how evocative it is, but there is something about the coupling of the musical production and the lyrical imagination that is pure magic.  When Waits creates the character of the American soldier on shore leave, who talked baseball with a lieutenant and shot billiards with a midget until the rain stopped, who bought a razor and some gum and knife and a t-shirt with horses on the front, the ambiance is enhanced by the clinging cowbells, thumping bass and other musical innovations that bring this scene to an almost theatrical life.  Unlike today's iPod culture which encouraged the consumption of &#34;singles&#34; and &#34;favorite hits&#34; without any kind of extended context, this album should be consumed and enjoyed in its entirety to get the full effect.  &#34;Frank's Wild Years&#34;, &#34;Gin Soaked Boy&#34;, &#34;In the Neighborhood&#34; etc certainly hold up on their own, but as an ensemble they are tantamount to major artistic achievement.
B00003CWLF|3.0|The special edition is, in fact, anamorphic widescreen. I originally ordered a copy of this movie which was labeled as widescreen, but the DVD itself was full screen. I ordered another copy and it was indeed anamorphic widescreen.      I had to edit my original review--but I can't change the original rating!  I give this movie 5 stars.
B00006GA4C|5.0|I've been a fan of this album a LONG time--since i was about 12(I'm 50 now) and I don't find it dated at all(great music is never dated).GFR (in the early days anyway) was always about one thing--rockin' out--which they do at their best on this album. \\"High Falutin Woman\\", \\"Mister Limousine Driver\\", \\"Got This Thing On the Move\\"--all great tunes. This is my favorite Funk album overall.

1416563156|4.0|This Lost Journal is essentially a small coffee table book that's made to look a cross between a diary and a scrap book. It's very pretty and any Indiana Jones fan will enjoy it immensely if they have no misconceptions about what it is.    What it is NOT is a diary prop. The simulated leather cover is nice enough, but the effect is spoiled by a colorful Indiana Jones logo that's printed on the spine and a very unauthentic sticker with the book's description glued firmly to the back. The book is replete with inserts -- photographs, news clippings, documents, maps, etc. -- but they are all printed, which gives it a very stylized appearance. Granted, actual loose inserts would have driven up the price significantly, but the kind of person who is likely to buy this would probably pay extra for the added realism. Many of the pages have an annotation (shaped like a business card) by \\"The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation\\". These annotations add nothing to the journal and the fact that they're written in English ruins any intended feeling that this is a recovered document. Clearly, writing them in Russian would have been useless for most people, so they should have just left them out and let the journal contents speak for themselves. Lastly, the contents themselves are just random snippets and souvenirs arranged chronologically. There's no sense of direction or purpose, which is what makes this a scrap book rather than a journal, despite the attempt to make it look like the latter.    Even with all these little complaints, it's a fun little toy and well worth the $25. In fact, it's cheap enough that one could buy a second copy to cut out various inserts to create or supplement a realistic Jones journal.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|These four young men who met at art school in Glasgow lay claim to an unfairly forgotten lineage of Scots post-punk pop. A timely conflation of snappy art-funk and spiralling guitars, Darts of Pleasure, the best three-track debut single since Suede's The Drowners, narrowly missed out on a top 40 placing last month. January's follow-up, Take Me Out, will almost certainly take the band on to Top of the Pops.
B00004R99U|2.0|Like nearly everyone else, I was not impressed with this movie at all. My nearly 3 year old loves Pocahontas and will sit thru the ENTIRE movie over and over but was bored within 30 minutes of watching this. To be honest, I was over this movie from the beginning. In the first one, Pocahontas spoke normally and in this one she sounds like she is just learning English. That just annoyed me throughout the whole movie. The ending was disappointing as well.
B0016CS0IK|5.0|The music is very relaxing if your having a bad day. I would totally recommend it for almost everyone. I have never here of them before and I glad I have found them.
0307265730|5.0|I always enjoy this author's work.  This was a nice change of pace to have several shorter stories to read each night in bed.
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|I will admit that I enjoyed this movie.  I have watched it multiple times and I notice a little more detail every time.  I thought the acting was great for what it was, the cinematography was excellent (probably my favorite aspect of the movie), The direction was intriguing, and the story was overall decently solid and thought-provoking.<br /><br />The only problem I had with the movie was its tendency to become a bit full of itself.  By this I mean resorting to being a bit melodramatic at times and jauntily wacky at other times.  The flow was a bit odd.  The tendency for politicos to latch on to this film as if it were the all-encompassing life giving teet of the one true god has tarnished this movie for a lot of people in the same manner that goth out the bum tweens ruined The Crow. As long as you ignore the crazy fans, this movie fills the empty hole left by terrible romance comedies and \\"underground\\" films that should have stayed underground... preferably under three tons of cement, 20ft of sewer, and hundreds of feet of skyscraper.<br /><br />It was fun, pretty, interesting, and worth my time.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|It seems like a lot of people were expecting Portishead to pick up right where they left off over a decade ago and produce an album which would fit in nicely with their previous offerings.  Thankfully, they didn't.  Like a lot of people who zealously loved the band over ten years ago, I've grown up and changed.  Portishead have done the same.  And as this album attests to, they've done a much better job at maturing than I have.  The new album is recognizably Portishead thanks, in large part, to Beth Gibbons' distinct voice.  The music itself still retains much of the band's earlier style: it's languid, dark and vaguely sinister.  However, this album places much more emphasis on eeriness and at times it sometimes seems downright ominous.  It also lacks a lot of the pop aesthetic of the earlier albums...you can't really sing along to any of these new songs.  But \\"Third\\" is a brilliant and complex work with the music swaying from jarring and shrill to uneasy and serene, sometimes within the same track.  In many ways, it's the perfect musical accompaniment to the precarious and spastic world we inhabit today.  Sure, it would be nice to go back to the era of \\"Dummy\\" but those days are long gone.  Portishead has realized that and one could theorize that \\"Third\\" is their creative reaction to the world of the early 21st century whereas the previous albums were, likewise, reactions to the world of the early 1990s.  A lot has happened since.  So if you can't bear the thought of the band significantly changing after ten years, then you're probably not going to like this album.  But if you can accept that this isn't going to sound like their first two albums, then give it a whirl.  It's well worth it.
B00005JPS7|5.0|Up there with Indy 4 and Prince Caspian, Iron Man was one of the top movies I was looking forward to this summer. And thankfully, I was not disappointed. In fact, just about every aspect of the movie impressed me.  As I expected, Robert Downey Jr. captured Tony Stark better than anyone else could have.  The wit, charm, and intensity he brought to the character incorporated everything essential about the billionaire industrialist. He's a playboy, eccentric genius, with a drinking problem. But when Stark discovers that his own company's weapons are being used by terrorists, he decides to live a life of purpose and make some big changes.<br /><br />Donning several versions of Iron Man suits, Tony Stark goes through as much transforming as his inventions. Iron Man is an origin story, but still allows for plenty of depth and character development without letting the story suffer. The supporting cast exceeded expectations: Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane, Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, and even director Jon Favreau himself plays the small role of Harold Hogan.<br /><br />The special effects and technology also blew me away. From the testing of Stark's armor to the final showdown, viewers will be impressed at the amazing visual effects and plenty of big explosions.  With plenty of humor to lighten up the scenes of intense suspense and action; Iron Man is sure to be entertaining enough for the whole family. And after the credits roll, there's a fun little clip that fellow Marvel comic geeks will enjoy, hinting towards a sequel with some beloved characters.<br /><br />The summer blockbusters have certainly started out with a bang!
B0000VCZKM|1.0|I was so dissapointed in this film when it was released, as were many fans of the stage show. The casting was perfect but the re-written plot and overdone direction helped to prove that musicals could not be made well anymore, thank god now for Chicago and Sweeney Todd! The Disney TV version was so much betterm it really captured the feel of the original stage play.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|My favorite Jane Austin movie. I've watched it over and over again. Paltrow does a fabulous job blending coy with intelligence.
074356619X|5.0|Great audio book.  I loved all of it, and bought one for each of my friends.  Kandice
B000AP04OM|5.0|We love this movie. Such a classic. My kids love it too. They don't make musicals like this any more. This was a fun edition because it had the anniversary interviews with some of the actors. They're much older now but it was fun to see them back together again talking about the movie.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|Most people have said all there really is to say about this film.  I liked it very much, in spite of what I considered to be excessive blood and guts, but my one true complaint is the casting of Helena Bonham Carter.  She can't sing -- even remotely -- and she doesn't even have the talent to talk her way through a song, a la Yul Brynner in \\"The King and I\\" or Rex Harrison in \\"My Fair Lady.\\"  It really doesn't work to cast a completely tone deaf person in a musical role, and that brings down the entire production.    Tim Burton would have done better not to cast his girlfriend in his film.
B0015YGA0Y|3.0|The track listing is wrong, the new bonus songs are not on the video.    Actual Track Listing:  1. Dejame Entrar    2. Manda Una Senal    3. Labios Compartidos    4.

Things that could have been better:  1. Only three songs from Amar es Combatir with most of the songs from previous albums and therefore with live versions available elsewhere.  2. NO subtitles.  I don't speak spanish very well so I Loved it how on Acceso Total I was able to watch it with Spanish subtitles (to help me learn the words better) and with English subtitles (to help me figure out what it all means).  None of that here.  3. No bonus materal at all.  This is just songs from the conert.
B0010VD7EO|3.0|I've heard complaints about the \\"overproduction\\" of this album, but that doesn't bother me.  After all, overproduction has a long tradition in rock going all the way back to Phil Spector.  Many of the \\"progressive rock\\" bands, like Yes and the Moody Blues, specialized in multi-layered opuses. Even today there are bands that are heirs apparent to that style, like Flaming Lips, Polyphonis Spree, and Arcade Fire.  This band does \\"overproduction\\" quite well, and they definitely put across the image of a neo-hippie, hedonistic lifestyle.  Just watch their hyper-psychedelic video of \\"Time to Pretend\\" and you'll know where their heads are at, as they used to say back in the `60's.  That leadoff track gets the album off to a joyous start, and even if you don't subscribe to the drug-culture lifestyle they seem to espouse (sardonically or otherwise - this song is probably one of the factors that earned them an \\"explicit lyrics\\" label), you have to admit it's a fun and freewheeling track.  In fact, there's a lot of bohemian fun and loose song structure throughout this album, infused with some often \\"retro\\" engineering tricks.  Another standout track is \\"Electric Feel\\", where they lay down one of the funkiest '70's-style grooves I've heard in some time.  The energy level seems to flag a little in the latter half, but overall it's an enjoyable, if rather lightweight album, the kind you'll like to play on your car stereo on a warm spring day with the windows down.
0767821629|5.0|I watched this on TV before purchasing it for my library.    The Thirteenth Floor implies ghosts, goblins & spooky stuff.  Nothing could be further from the truth.    It's a FANTASTIC virtual reality film!     I recommend it totally and have watched it more than once.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Nikki Sixx finally tells about the dark side to rock-n-roll. These are very good songs.I was pleasantly surprised on how good it was.Finally,Some rokin' songs. Nikki's band is excellent. I can't wait to see them at Crue Fest.We need more rock and less Crap(Rap). No Rappers or wannabes,Just rock. We are all happy Nikki is still with us.I hope the next generation gets the message from his experience and songs. Drugs suck!! Life is beautiful. It took a serious illness for me to see it. I hope everyone out there gets it. You need this one. It's a must have.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Its the music that you hear in the movie. Very well put together. I personally love listening to it on my ZEN. Some of the songs are quieter, so you may have to turn the volume up in the car. Good to listen to in the car if your drive a lot.
B000VDDWDS|1.0|Fox Blu-Rays are the worst on the market. Bare bones and picture quality is B.S. See Predator for picture Quality compared to other Blu-Ray releases, terrible.

0679805273|5.0|I love this book.  It is honest but hopeful.  I have 2 copies of this book.  One for my son and one for my daughter.  Neither of them know about them.  I have been having their teachers sign a little message to them at the end of each school year and will give it to them when they graduate from high school.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is my favorite U2 album.  I saw them on their legendary, amazing Zoo TV tour (at the World Music Theater in Tinley Park, Illinois, more on the show later).  This is a wildly creative, ambitious album.  It's not the work of idle artists, but vibrant ones.  U2 has managed that rare feat in rock and roll to keep exploring and pushing themselves without sounding self indulgent (except for Zooropa).<br /><br />The opening track, Zoo Station, is a favorite, and the song they kicked the concert off with.  One is one of their best ballads, and I absolutely love Until the End of the World.  It was written for the Wim Wenders film, and it's one of the best things about Wenders's film (which, honestly, is a bit of a mess).  The single Mysterious Ways (replete with a belly dancer during the show) is one of their best singles ever.  I love the CD booklet as well, which has some amazing photographs and is one of the best examples of making a great CD jacket.  It's like a great album cover, which is quickly becoming a lost art.<br /><br />When I saw this concert, one of the best things was when Bono called the local police (honestly).  The sound system that U2 was using was for huge arenas, and the World Music Theater, while a large outdoor arena, wasn't a huge one, but the sound system didn't know that.  The Tinley Park police department received many complaints about the noise, so Bono called them on the third show they did in that venue to complain about the noise.  Us in the crowd cooperated with Bono to let the police know that there was too much noise, if you know what I mean.  It was a sensory overload type concert, with many monitors, lights, and even a car hanging above the stage (or a fake car).  It was a very memorable concert, one of the best I ever saw.  And this is my favorite U2 album....

1416914293|2.0|I checked out City of Ashes from my local library. Unlike City of Bones, which I bought to see if I could use it in my classroom (I couldn't), I was just reading City of Ashes for my own pleasure.     There are a few good things about City of Ashes and many bad things about it. I will discuss the positive aspects first. (Be forewarned I am going to be discussing major plot points of this novel (i.e. SPOILERS), if you have not read City of Ashes, then I suggest you SKIP my review).     I must say that in this book, Ms. Clare's characterizations are somewhat better. Not a whole lot better, but improved, at least most of the Star Wars references are gone. For example, I really enjoyed the characters of Alec and Magnus. In fact, they are the only reason I gave this book 2 stars instead of one. Their love story is bold, interesting and different. I hope Ms. Clare will expand on their relationship in the third book. For me, Alec and Magnus were my favorite part of City of Ashes.     Now onto the negative aspects of the book. First, the book starts out with a bang with Valentine showing up. Then, we get 6 chapters of BORING, slow-paced nonsense. Unfortunately Ms. Clare doesn't seem to know how to write a fast-paced sequel that can keep the reader awake with drama and action. The end picks up, but by then the casual reader may have just discarded the novel.     Another negative aspect is that once again Ms. Clare is drawing from other source material for her characters (i.e. Buffy, the Vampire Slayer). In chapter one, when Clary and Simon are watching the movie Dracula, I figured out that by the end of the book Simon would turn into a vampire - and guess what he did! There was no surprise to this revelation. Now I know the book is being targeted to 14+, but that plot point was so obvious a 6 year old could have seen it coming.    Lastly, what is up with the promotion of an incestuous relationship between Clary and Jace? I understood that in book one, the two did not know they were brother and sister and had feelings for one another, but in this book they clearly know they are related and yet continue to kiss and discuss their romantic feelings ad nauseum. (At one point, Jace states he wants to be with Clary, no matter if they are related or not, Clary nixes that idea, but by the end of the book, she is okay with it?) I am not getting it. This book is geared towards young readers, so why is the author pushing an incestuous relationship onto her audience? I have my own ideas about why this is happening and will see if they play out in book 3, but for now that plot is just morally wrong. Brothers and sisters should not be thinking of making out or having sex with one another.     Overall, I cannot say I liked this book. On my hand it had some great aspects (Alec and Magnus), and then it had some downright awful things (incestuous plotline, slow pace). So, what I am recommending is that if you liked the first book, but are unsure of wanting to buy this book, then check it out of the library. Save yourself $[...].
B0013J30XG|5.0|I thought this was a great movie;a feast for the eyes!!!  I will admit I have NO idea what the plot was(corperations bad/racing good?)but I don't ever recall watching the 'toons for plot either!!!  I was blown away by the visuals and my inner child was made VERY happy!!!  An enjoyable way to celebrate my 41st birthday!!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|I never write reviews, but I just had to on this one. Let's be clear, either you \\"get\\" Sigur Ros or you do not. If not, that's fine, just move along.    Every song one this CD are either ridiculously beautiful and soaring (Hoppipolla, Saeglopur, Andvari, Glosoli) or are simply stellar (the rest of the CD). There is absolutely zero filler here. Some of the songs almost make you want to cry.    If you like Radiohead, Flaming Lips, Muse, Bjork, then this CD is right up your alley!
B0013D8LOK|1.0|Let me tell you where I stand before I tell you where I sit. I enjoyed the Lansbury stage version, I usually like Burton, I almost always love Depp and when I originally saw the trailer, I was excited to see it. Having said that, I was incredibly disappointed. Depp and Carter couldn't sing and the dialogue was so muddled it was difficult to understand. I know I'm in the minority here but this was the hardest movie to watch that I've seen this year. I rank this right up there with Batman Returns as one of the rare Burton movies that just didn't work for me.
B00006LLNU|4.0|The material on this CD is some of thier sparser, slower-tempo, morose, moody, darker material compared to, say, Takk. As such, this CD requires a few more listens to get under your skin. Some of the tracks, such as four, and eight, have a prog- space-rock vibe going, languishing at a slow burn, evocative of early-seventies Pink Floyd or OK Computer/Kid A -era Radiohead.    This CD does lack the warmth and emotion, again, found on Takk, but if you prefer atmosphere and mystery, then this album has lots of it.
B000MGATTE|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved the characters, the language and the premise.  I will admit that it was slow going the first chapter or so but I am so glad I didn't give up on it.    It is the kind of book that you'll want to read again when you are done to absorb what you may have missed the first time.    Great read.
0425223523|4.0|In 1806, naval officer Frederick Wentworth is on leave as he knows he must return to duty with the Napoleonic Wars ravaging the continent and threatening England.  In Somerset to visit his brother, Frederick meets and falls in love with Anne Elliot.  She feels as strongly as he does.  They become engaged, but heeding the advice of her godmother Lady Russell, she persuades Anne to break off with Frederick the next day.  Stunned and outraged the now acrimonious sailor returns to sea no longer innocent in affairs of the heart.<br /><br />Eight years later, affluent Captain Wentworth has come home to find a bride who shows the slightest deference to the navy; any female except Anne.  However, when he sees Anne for the first time since she informed him she changed her mind, Wentworth knows he still loves her.  He does not want to pursue her, but cannot help but chase after her.  Anne regrets her error as she never stopped loving Frederick, but fears it is too late for them.<br /><br />Her second diary historical romance (see MR. KNIGHTLY'S DIARY) is an engaging second chance regency romance told mostly by Captain Wentworth in a log like manner.  The story line breaks into two periods in which the audience sees the young unsure Anne and the gentle Frederick fall in love but split and the more mature couple still in love.  Readers will appreciate Amanda Grange's fine tale.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

Although, compulsive and a bit \\"different\\" his passion for life and curiosity with the world around him were remarkable.  His wit and wisdom along with stories of his antics and general mischief acted as a magnet pulling me to the next page.  This book was hard to put down and reminded me to remain curious throughout life.  Well worth the time it takes to read, I will be reading other books by Mr. Feynman.
0345495004|5.0|Having visited Fallingwater three times now, I'm a big fan of Frank Lloyd Wright. He was a creative genius who had a huge influence on American architecture. When I read a second review praising Nancy Horan's book, I decided to get it. She has done a superb job of imagining Mameh's thoughts about her life and the complications of her affair with Wright. It was a bonus to read about the \\"Woman Movement\\" in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century when Mameh translated Swedish books for the American market. Since I'd forgotten the ending of their affair, I was dumbstuck by how it unfolded. Horan is an excellent writer.

1572815108|3.0|The product dimensions in the description makes it sound as though the cards are the larger size; they are not! The measurements given are for the box, and the box is much bigger than the cards! Who measures a box? The colors are somewhat drab compared to the deck I work with now, which is an older version. Every person interested in tarot, however, should own a Crowley deck. The images will bring about a better understanding of the cards. This deck is reasonably priced, and as another reviewer stated, the smaller size makes it easier to spread the cards. I bought this deck so I could frame my other deck, and that has worked nicely for me.

Probably 3 or 4 books a week since I learned how.  This is simply my favorite book of all time- for too many reasons to tell.  I haven't ever met anyone who DIDN't like this book.  I can't wait to read it to my children- its well worth your time and money- even if you've already seen the movie.

B00003BDXG|1.0|I agree with a couple of points only. No, this not a typical robbery and killing spree movie. Its filled with satire and parody on everything you can think of. If you watch this movie be expecting an extreme satire using hardcore violence and black comedy. I myself wasnt warned and I expected something near a pulp fiction or a resivoir dogs type move, NO.. you getting a \\"saturday night live\\" skit thats a couple hours long, only difference is they include hardcore violence. The rest will have you falling asleep, not much of the storyline through dialogue makes any sense at all. Dont waste your money!! I would rate this with right up there with the \\"scary movie\\" parodys.
6305313687|5.0|I vaguely remember seeing the trailer for this movie when it first came out. I spoke to a friend of mine in 2001 and he told me that it was good so I looked at him like he was crazy. I decided to see it in 2005 and was blown away by how good it was. Now, look if you can handle extremely harsh racial rhetoric you're about to hear then you can find out that this movie is a gem with great performances and a good look at racism and its effects on people's lives.<br /><br />Plot/spoiler: Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is a well-known white supremacist who just received jail time for a carjacker. In jail he realizes how wrong-headed he has been and sees how fellow white supremacists don't even follow the \\"morals\\" they set(add to that another incident I wont give away to anybody who hasn't seen it). He befriends a black inmate named Lamont(Guy Torry). He drops his hateful ways, is released from jail and comes home to find his brother Danny(Edward Furlong) going down the same destructive path. Danny Vinyard has a dilemma also. His professor, Dr. Sweeney(played by the underrated and underused Avery Brooks) is not happy on the report that Danny wrote on the views of the most notorious killer in world history(I wont spoil that for you either), so he has him write his report again so Danny writes about his brother and their life growing up.<br /><br />Opinion: This is the best movie of 1998 and I'll go out on a limb and say that this is one of the most important films in history. Edward Norton gives an excellent performance as the prejudiced Danny Vinyard who lives his life through hate only to realized how misguided and confused his hatred was. I've always hated Edward Furlong(since the god-awful Pet Sematery 2) but he gives a good performance as the brother who goes down the same sad path of his brother. Beverly D'Angelo is in top form as the mother who has to put up with the pain her son causes with his racism. Avery Brooks is great as Dr. Sweeney and Guy Torry is his usual goofy but funny self as Lamont. The story is well-written and well acted without coming off as pretentious. You really believed that those characters thought that way. American History X tackles a most feared subject in America without trivializing it and the movie itself was not made to teach hate. It was meant to tell a story of a man filled with hate but later realizes the error of his ways and tries to stop his brother from making the same mistake. This movie will stand out as one of the best things to come out of modern cinema. Two thumb WAY up.lf as Lamont. The story is well-written and well acted without coming off as pretentious.

And they do it very, very well.<br /><br />4.5 stars for the jaw dropping moves these kids are able to do but a mere 2 stars for everything else, so let's round that to 3 stars shall we.<br /><br />Though it's been said over and over again about other movies of this ilk, there has to be more to a movie than the dancing and as far as Step Up 2 the Streets goes, the other stuff just doesn't really cut it.<br /><br />The film chronicles - did I say chronicles? - sorry, no, this movie doesn't chronicle anything, it's about a young street dancer named Andie (Briana Evigan). She's beautiful, out of this world talented and certainly doesn't want to be shipped off to Texas which is where she's headed if she doesn't stop getting into trouble.<br /><br />Andie gets accepted into the elite Maryland School of the Arts (MSA) where she attempts to widen her dancing scope to more classical styles. Her street dancing crew the 4-1-0 - all but one of whom does not know Andie is now enrolled in the school - become sick and tired of the excuses she gives as to why she isn't able to attend practice with them and they eventually kick her out of the crew.<br /><br />This is where I find the character flaws in the movie to be really apparent...these kids are obviously in their late teens and 20s, however they spend all day dancing in the streets, Have they no jobs?? No responsibilities?? How do they pay for the cost of living? Don't they even take a break to make some deals or turn some tricks?? It's not just that they are sooo devoted to dancing and preparing for a dance battle called \\"The Streets\\", the writers make it seem like they genuinely solely exist to practice their dancing 24-7. No one has to go home because their baby-mama is always nagging, no one has goals or dreams, their only purpose in the film is to dance...and still with all that practice they still don't have what it takes.<br /><br />Fortunately, all these annoyances are seasoned with superbly choreographed and exceptionally performed dance numbers that make the knot in my forehead relax until the plot gets back underway.<br /><br />Andie decides to put together her own crew made up of static, clich&eacute; outcast kids that go to MSA. There's the Asian girl who thinks she's \\"down\\" but you can't understand a word she says, the tall-loner girl no one hangs out with, a guy who's supposed to be the nerdy guy, but this isn't really developed, a few others not worth mentioning and the other main character, Chase Collins (Robert Hoffman).<br /><br />When we first hear of Chase, we are immediately led to believe that he is MSA royalty but living in the shadow of his older, more talented MSA faculty brother and also that his dancing skills have given him a sense of entitlement making him something of a playa with the ladies. This would be all well and good, for Chase would be a well-developed character and even have opportunities for growth as he tries to redeem himself from his philandering ways and woo our heroine Andie. However, as soon as we get to know Chase, he's not like this at all, in fact none of the earlier descriptions of him are mentioned again or developed at all - he's just a regular boring guy with nothing extraordinarily good or bad about him. But, like everyone else in the film, he's great looking...and man, can he dance!<br /><br />Alright, so the \\"plot\\" eventually brings us to the ultimate street battle called, no less, \\"The Streets\\" between the new crew and the old crew in a rain-soaked climax I won't ruin it for you (really, if you have to ask who wins you just don't get how formulaic this film is). This dance-off is well worth the wait as the choreography is spot-on. The scene could not have been shot with more skill, you can see how fluid the dancing is, nothing is chopped up which leaves the viewer in awe at how many laws of physics are shattered by the moves these kids are able to do!<br /><br />Another thing worth mentioning is the supposed-nerdy kid named Moose (newcomer Adam G. Sevani) who befriends Andie at MSA, he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves. He makes the most of the character given him and probably saves the story that falls flat in between dance numbers. Maybe, just maybe, one day he'll be the Jason Biggs of a new generation.<br /><br />In summary, don't get me wrong, when I left the theater I was smiling and wishing I had those mad skills. You just have to know what to expect before you see the movie or you may wind up being too disappointed to really appreciate how superb the dancing is. Thus, if dancing is your thing, do lower your expectations as regards plot and characterization and do cop this disc and you too will be wowed and blown away by the dancing as these kids Step up 2 The Streets.he's a kid who we see is stuck in the wrong major once we see his entertaining freestyle moves.

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|Madonna is one of the few artists who consistently delivers new styles (musically and physically) and refuses to release anything that rehashes its predecessors.  \\"Hard Candy\\" is certainly no exception to this icon's ever-changing repertoire.<br /><br />For the most part, \\"Hard Candy\\" is entertaining and well done.  Only a couple of tracks (\\"Candy Shop\\" and \\"Spanish Lesson\\") really make you run for the Skip button on your player.<br /><br />Even Justin Timberlake and Kanye West can't seem to pull their tracks up from the dreaded \\"that was just okay\\" territory.  But that's not to say there aren't some exceptional tracks.<br /><br />For those of you who would prefer to buy your albums song-by-song, please note that \\"Heartbeat,\\" \\"Miles Away,\\" \\"Voices,\\" and \\"Devil Wouldn't Recognize You\\" are definite hits amongst an album of almost-but-not-quite songs.<br /><br />Yet even these handful of addictive songs never quite reach the musical brilliance of Confessions, nor do any have the stunning emotional depth of Ray of Light.  Nevertheless, this is not a throw-away album and is still worthy of a good spin.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Genius Loves Company (2004) was Ray Charles' last album, a collaborative affair with various musicians and singers handpicked by Ray himself. Liver cancer would end Ray's life before the album was released to great commercial success and won eight Grammy Awards. The album's Grammy Awards were in part sentimental, and I must admit that my five star rating is, too. Sentimentality is what Genius Loves Company is really all about. It's by no means Ray Charles at his peak as a performer. In fact, he's not in good health, way past his best days and just doing the best he can to keep up with everyone else. And that's just fine with me. The singers here all feel incredibly honored to be chosen by Ray to participate in this special project, and each one knows that in his prime Ray Charles could outperform all of them put together. The atmosphere is almost like a celebration or a party to honor the beloved legend. It's schmaltzy and sentimental, and everyone is celebrating and complimenting (in quotes in the liner notes) the great Ray Charles.<br /><br />I really went into Genius Loves Company determined that I was going to like it, no matter what. And even though Ray's worn and tired vocal performance produced a few shakey moments, by the time I got to the end of the album, I did like it. I also had a tear in my eye, and a new level of love and respect for who Ray Charles actually was, the legend that he is, and how he overcame the odds like he did.<br /><br />Here We Go Again (w/Norah Jones) opens the album and sounds wonderful (it won a Grammy for Record Of The Year). It's followed by the fun of Sweet Potato Pie (w/James Taylor) and the uneasy blues of You Don't Know Me (w/Diana Krall). The haunting Sorry Seems To Be The Hardest Word (w/Elton John) is a favorite of mine here, and the orchestrated arrangement highlights the song perfectly. The funky and jazzy Fever (w/Natalie Cole) and the country meets jazz Do I Ever Cross Your Mind (w/Bonnie Raitt) are both winners, and Ray's soulful, but subdued singing is still a joy to listen to as the old spark returns here and there. Ray's old and close friend Willie Nelson joins him on the heavily orchestrated It Was A Very Good Year. The song is perfect here and is sort of a turning point for the album. Knowing what good friends these two were for so many years makes it even more special. Of course, Willie didn't come to the party empty handed. He brought Trigger (his trademark and beat up old guitar) with him and you can hear it in the arrangement. B.B. King brought Lucille (his famous guitar) with him, too, and joins Ray for what's probably the best song on the album, Sinner's Prayer. With Billy Preston providing the organ and B.B. playing his guitar, Ray and B.B. belt out the blues, and Ray sounds better and more comfortable in this setting than he does anywhere on the album. Heaven Help Us All (w/Gladys Knight) is a gospel flavored highlight and quite an emotional and beautiful piece of music. Hey Girl (w/Michael McDonald) and Somewhere Over The Rainbow (w/Johnny Mathis) both work well and fit comfortably with the album's reflective spirit. There's also a good live version of Crazy Love (w/Van Morrison) from the night Ray inducted Van (by Van's request) into The Songwriters Hall Of Fame.<br /><br />Genius Loves Company will pain some who don't want to be bothered with hearing a legend way past his prime sing his songs anymore, but I quite enjoy hearing this man giving it another shot, holding his own with some of the world's greatest singers. Ray Charles deserved this album, he more than earned it, I'm glad I own it and it makes me proud to listen to it.

0670034711|1.0|I am a 22 year old woman and I do not understand why this book is so popular amoung women my age and older than myself. I mean is this what so many women really like to read? I would consider myself an avid reader and I got this book from a good friend of mine. It seemed like a very interesting book about a woman who discovers who she is while seeing and experiencing different cultures and ways of life through travel. I was surprised to see that this was not the case. The author, Liz   goes to Italy India and Indonesia after expieriencing a painful divorce. The funny thing about this is that Liz makes the painful divorce the catalyst of the story, yet she never explains why she wanted to divore her husband in the first place. She says she does not want to go into details about this. BUT IT IS THE CATALYSTE OF THE STORY. Yet in the following chapters while traveling she goes into wordy and sometimes excessive details about other people and things that happened to her,all the while never really getting to any point about any of them. Yet she ironically decides to be vague about why she wanted to end her marriage. Did he beat you, was he emotionally abusive? I think that this woman was just bored, restless and too self absorbed.              And did anyone notice that she hints that she cheated on her husband with David while she was still married? On page 124 in the India section she writes  \\"It was only a month after my first night tearfully begging God for answers that I found mine, having walked into David's apartment and encountered a photo of this stunning Indian woman.\\"  And in the beginning of the book she says 6 months after she cried and prayed to God on the bathroom floor, she had the strengh to leave her husband. I don't know if the writer did this on purpose, but either way it undermines her credibility.     I found this book boring mainly because the book doesn't go anywhere. The author is whiny, self absorbed and has superficial wisdom. Her insights werenot very developed for her age and she does not seem to really progress at all. I mean all she did in Italy for 4 months is eat for goodness sakes! She even admits that she never once visited a museum. She did not seem interested in learning about the the details of the culture , history historic places. She was not interested in anything but eating. She does learn Italian but who wouldn't when you are sorrounded by it all the time. She seems to wonder aimlessly with no purpose or destination other then to try different resturaunts. She seems to learn very little about the country, its rich history and people overall. And thus wastes alot of time. She could of done so many more useful and constructive things with her time that would  cause her to learn much and grow; which would of made a much more interesting read  as well.    The India section was the worst part in my opinion as it was basically rambling and whining about her not being able to calm her mind. Of course she couldn't she was so stuck in her own head. I bet she barely even noticed that She was in India. Probably never thought about the poverty and the suffering of the people there. Probably never thought or cared to learn much about the culture, except for what was thrown in her face and of what she could not avoid.  I found myself skipping pages just to get to some sort of point. It seems as if Liz could not progress because everytime someone tried to give contructive advise , she was on the defensive. I really think the you could of switched the sections of India and Italy to make India read first and it would not have made a difference to the story. Much of the book was non sequential rabbling, with no begginng , middle or end. I felt like I was reading the diary of a teenager except that it was a 34 year old woman.      The section of Indonesia was somewhat better as she started to talk more about the people and the culture instead of her own obsessive thoughts. I laughed when she met a Brazilianman named Filipe who she falls in love with. The author is the anti-thesis of the strong modern woman. The author's quest was supposed be be about her being independent and growth, yet at the end she is at the same place she was before, with a guy. There is nothing wrong with having a boyfriend, husband or looking for love in a foreign country. But the author wanted to be independent, yet is incapable of being on her own for longer then a year. She even admitted to having been in costant romantic relationships from the time she was a teen and had never lived by herself before untill the onset of this trip.     I would not recommed this book to anyone. The author is an embarrassment to hardwoking modern women everywhere, whether they be mothers, wives, single women, ect. I can only wonder if the author will learn someday to really LOOK outside of herself and see that suffering is part of the human experience. Perhaps then she will find her mind and life more at peace and balance.
0440243661|5.0|Once again, Lee Child has produced an excellent Jack Reacher novel. I couldn't put it down, and I couldn't resist writing a few lines to give it the five stars it deserves. If you like thrillers with an edgy, intelligent, and rugged lead character, then Reacher is your man. Enjoy!
B000002GKT|5.0|Humble Pie Performance Rockin' The Fillmore is the first best-ever live album to come out of the double lp live albums of the seventies.  This album is pure rock and roll ecstacy and is without peer.  Bob Seger's Silver Bullet Band album sounds like a bunch of pansys next to this masterpiece.  Peter Frampton's Frampton Comes Alive would never have happened had it not been for Rockin' the Fillmore, on which he played a vital role.  This is rock and roll at its best.  Powerful guitar, powerful singing, and a rock solid and powerful band.
038551123X|3.0|I usually don't read crime novels, but I'm a big fan of the Showtime series \\"Dexter,\\" and I wanted to read the novel the show is based on. \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is the first installment of Jeff Lindsay's series about Dexter Morgan, a serial killer with a conscience. Dexter routinely kills and dismembers people in and around Miami, but unlike other serial killers, Dexter has a strict moral code that he struggles to adhere to: Basically, he only kills bad guys. Dexter struggles to keep his dark side under wraps by working as a blood spatter analyst for the Miami Metro Police Department, hanging out with his foster sister, and even having a girlfriend. However, he always succumbs to his \\"Dark Passenger\\" and cannot suppress the urge to kill. When a new serial killer begins preying on Miami hookers, Dexter becomes intrigued by his new colleague and is intent on connecting with the murderer, even if it means exposing his own dark secrets.<br /><br />This book was pretty good. Unlike most crime novels, which I usually think are very poorly written, \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" is composed of a blend of dark humor, intense drama, mystery and suspense, and good old-fashioned blood and gore. I was pleasantly surprised by how much content from the book was used in Season 1 of the television series \\"Dexter.\\" There are some big differences between the book and the TV show, though. The \\"Tamiami Butcher\\" is referred to as the \\"Ice Truck Killer\\" in the TV show. The characters of Angel Batista, Vince Masuka, and James Doakes are relatively minor characters in the novel and are featured much more prominently in the television series. Migdia LaGuerta (who is called Maria LaGuerta in the show) is a supporting character in the novel, but is even nastier in the book that she is in the series, if you can believe that.<br /><br />There are several other plot differences between the book and the novel, and overall, I think the television series is actually much better than the book. All of the characters are much more interesting in the show, and there are more intriguing subplots in the series as well. Also, I thought the ending of the book was extremely rushed, especially the part detailing the relationship Dexter has with the Tamiami Butcher. Hopefully that aspect of things is explored more in Lindsay's other novels, but I don't know if it is or not.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the show \\"Dexter\\" or simply enjoy the crime novel genre, you'll probably find \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\" to be an interesting read. However, don't feel like you absolutely need to read the novel if you're a fan of the Showtime series.

The film also stars Timothy Dalton, Kenny Baker and Richard O'Brien, this a delightful and colorful epic that i loved since i was a kid and still love.

As an opera lover myself, absolutely loved the Karoeke of O Sole Mio! We were totally surprised about the \\"Impossible Dream\\" dvd of the making of this \\"historic\\" video. It is worth purchasing solely based on the historic nature of this concert. It was really beyond our wildest expectations. The price is well worth it.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|This album is the best indie album i have every heard , the entire thing is captivating and very moving , at first i hated soul meets body but i bought this album on a whim and i love it , its one of my favorites. give this a try , take a few listens and then judge.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|It also constantly made me wonder, despite its opening \\"this is fiction\\" disclaimer, just how much of this is real.  It's a spy story set in 1980s East Germany, at the height of the Stasi era, about spying on \\"the lives of others,\\" hence its title.<br /><br />The characters were extremely real, and the best stories must unfold from that.  We also have loyalty puzzles to solve, a gripping plot, political realism, a fast pace, and just intelligence from the writer and a desire by everyone associated with this film to make something great.<br /><br />I've just recently learned about downloading movies from Amazon, which would be a major boon if we could do it from outside the US as well.  But this is a DVD that was meant to be owned, because you'll want to watch it again.  It's a keeper.
B00009V7OL|3.0|A tribute to 10cc's song \\"I'm Not in Love\\" is made at the climax of the film as Mery Elizabeth Mastrantonio quotes to dying Ed Harris the \\"Big Boys don't cry\\" line, soon followed by the word 10cc.    Not bad deep water sci-fi. Good performances all around and impressive special effects. The dialogue and word play gets a bit too hammy and the ending is way over the top, which kind of spoils an otherwise good lead up to the climatic finish.    Could be considered an underwater \\"Twister\\" sort of movie. Heavy on effects, that takes plenty of liberty with reality. And relies much more on fiction even though it's portrayed mostly as science.    Recommended as a popcorn movie, but don't expect groundbreaking, thought provoking cinema.
B00139W3NE|2.0|I had high hopes for THE GOLDEN COMPASS. The cast. The special effects. The story. It promised to be a dazzling cinematic experience. But the dazzle fell into Dudsville as Philip Pullman's magical novel got off to horrible start.<br /><br />Before I get started, however, I think it's noteworthy to mention how ridiculous I found the claims surrounding the persecution of Christianity and The Church with regards to this film. You might be able to draw parallels between atheism and some of what was seen. But it could also represent Nazism. I know that Pullman WAS an atheist, but to say his books (and this film) represented that view is simply untrue. With the release of [[ASIN:B000E8M0VA The Chronicles of Narnia]], Christianity has nothing to fear. Which is also why this review is tough for me.<br /><br />I don't prescribe to any particular faith (you might even call me *gasp!* an atheist), but I don't go to movies in order to reinforce my beliefs. I go to be entertained. And, as I've said many times before, entertainment starts with a good (or great) script. And The Golden Compass' start was exceptionally unimpressive.<br /><br />Jumping around like a child with A-D-D, The Golden Compass lacked perspective and a unified focus. The story is SUPPOSED to focus on Lyra (Dakota Blue Richards), a young girl who's parentage is in question on a parallel world where \\"beasts\\" (see Animals) are part of ones being. They tag along beside you and are basically your soul (Oh my God! Christians Unite! *Whoops! There I go!*) Each person has a different animal/beast and young people's animals can change from one to another until they settle on a shape as they approach adulthood. Lyra's uncle Lord Asriel (Daniel Craig, [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale]]) is a scientist who goes against the grain of this parallel world and its leaders. He's found that \\"dust\\" from other worlds is flowing into theirs and he wants to discover what this dust is all about. But the powers that be want to stop him.<br /><br />Enter Marisa Coulter (Nicole Kidman, [[ASIN:B00005JPCF Happy Feet]]), a dangerous player within a government that seeks to control everything, including Lyra. Marisa fraudulently befriends Lyra and takes her on a trip North, but not before Lyra receives a magical golden compass from a high councilor at the school where her uncle worked. The compass, it is said, is the last of its kind and can tell the truth and possibly the future.<br /><br />Encounters with giant polar bears, flights in massive zeppelins, child prisons in the far-north, all culminate to form ... a disaster. And I don't mean a disaster for Lyra, but a disaster for the movie-watcher.<br /><br />The canvas is simply too broad to be a coherent whole. Multiple side stories are mentioned and then never seen again or quickly wrapped up with little-to-no understanding. The script obviously was very choppy; perhaps [[ASIN:B000031WD9 American Pie]] director Chris Weitz wasn't the best person to write it?<br /><br />The only upside to the film is the incredible special effects. Most of the scenes were pure ga-ga for the eyes. Which means that The Golden Compass is more fluff than substance. By contrast, The Chronicles of Narnia was exceptionally well put together with a few duds in the special effects arena. But Narnia held together extremely well, while The Golden Compass didn't have a direction.ulter (Nicole Kidman, [[ASIN:B00005JPCF Happy Feet]]), a dangerous player within a government that seeks to control everything, including Lyra.

B000YCLRBA|5.0|I dare to say that this production was the MET last year major achievement. Even though a stupendous singers set was gathered for this performance it did not necessarily guarantee it´s amazing success. This dreamed cast is formed by three of the most talented singers of our time: Dmitri Hvorostovsky, Renée Flemming and Ramón Vargas.     The staging is minimalist however absolutely accurate and tasty. By adding different intelligent elements the drama flows both naturally and flawlessly, in other words impeccable. The Russian Maestro Valery Gergiev conducted the MET orchestra with full commitment and passion.  The Siberian baritone Dmitri Hvorsotovsky is enormous as Onegin completely understanding the character and making it his own. Needless to say he is at his best here, both vocally and dramatically; I don´t see anyone at this moment to be a match for him in this roll.  Renée Flemming is tremendous as Tatiana, she is simply perfect. Her acquaintance with Hvorostovsky is impressing.  Ramón Vargas as Lensky is memorable, precise and passionate confirming his position as one of the more reliable tenors of his generation. His \\"Kuda, kuda\\" was performed effortlessly with real suffering and pain.  Elena Zaremba portrays a charming Olga with no less intelligence and knowledge of her role.  The secondary roles are covered more than efficiently.    Needless to say, that this is truly a \\"must have\\" for every opera fan and especially for Mexican Opera Fans, not only for the price, but for the achievement.

0061245097|5.0|This series just gets better and better! I love that Cat and Bones can't get enough of each other and they have great chemistry..I am not sure if she is writing more books, but I am praying she plans on writing like 12 more books! This book they introduced more important characters and Cat gets to finally meet her dad, meet him not kill him, but I am praying we will see him again in the future. I love the scenes with Cat and Annette fighting over Bones, cracked me up!! Keep them coming Jeanine!!!
B00005NKK8|5.0|I ordered this item for my sister who just loves the Forrest Gump movie.  She was looking around for the soundtrack because she enjoyed the music in the movie alot.  She was very pleased with this item.
B00005JOA0|5.0|I watched this movie because I love many of the actors, especially Rupert Graves(Forsythe Saga,Room With a View),Toby Stevens(Chamomile Lawn, Jane Eyre)and Tara Fitzgerald(Chamomile Lawn,Frenchman's Creek). My greatest and most wonderful SURPRISE was to discover JAMES PUREFOY (HBO/\\"ROME's Mark Anthony)playing Helen's brother, Gilbert! This CD definately goes into my \\"Favorite Movie\\" cabinet. Excellent story, great casting&acting by all involved in this production.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've never seen a Broadway musical, but I love the CD's!!  Especially this one--what can I say?  The music is amazing, the singers are incredible...it is just the most enjoyable thing to listen to.  My favorite thing to do is read the plot synopsis on Wiki, then listen to the whole CD and imagine the story in my mind.  If you like Broadway, this is a great, great CD.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|I was very concerned when i learned portishead was making a new album... the thoughts kept racing through my head- \\"will it sound like portishead?\\" \\"i hate to think they will rehash their previous success.\\"   \\"how do you progress from something so unique?\\" well....i have my answers. if this is what i have to look forward to every ten years in their ouvre, i will sit patiently by and wait. this album is amazing. phenomenal. when i buy cds, i always worry that there will be a string of weak tracks that i feel i've wasted my money on. but i buy the cds because they're from artists that i love and i must continue to collect just to have the entire collection of an artist. there is not one work track on this one. and thank you portishead for keeping it fresh and interesting.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Haven't ever owned a Fleetwood Mac album although I play a D tuning version of \\"Never Going Back\\".  I bought this CD to bring an order for something else up to $25 so I could get the shipping charge waived.    Glad I did.  This is a really nice sampling of their best songs and I find myself enjoying most all of them.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I recently purchased a Playstation 3 and a high definition TV and bought 'Planet Earth' to judge for myself just how good high definition is. I was totally in awe after I watched this series. The BBC has ushered in a new dimension in documentaries in high definition with each episode delivering incredibly beautiful footage of the earth and its wildlife. If you ever wanted a reason to buy a Blu Ray player, this is it.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|This film is definitely not for everyone.  If you hated 'The Blair Witch Project' then you'll probably hate this as well.  The entire film is shot on hand held cameras so if you're prone to motion sickness, you should steer clear.  Personally, I really enjoyed this movie. It was original and completely different from your average horror/monster film.  I thought the cast did a good job and the film felt like it was unraveling as you watched it in real time.  The special effects were very good and the director's use of the low light levels and the \\"less is more\\" monster shots were extremely effective.  Even when you did see the monster clearly, you couldn't really wrap your brain around it.  I think Clover may go down as one of the coolest looking monsters ever.  If you are a fan of monster flicks then you will probably enjoy this but keep those camera shots in mind.
0307237702|5.0|I recently walked the way to and from my car, to and from work while listening to the audio book version of \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\" Obama proved to offer hope and inspiration to get through things, the kind of hope and inspiration the United States is in need of these days. Hearing his voice throughout the chapters offered the comfort that aggressive talk lacks, the kind that the political campaign sometimes misses.<br /><br />In \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" Barack Obama makes me want to be the voter that I still am not (I am not yet a U.S. citizen). He helps me dream of a better United States, one that is not an impossibility but a very plausible country where leadership is in contact with the priorities and hopes of the people and the world.
0689865384|5.0|With three months until Tally Youngblood turns sixteen, she sneaks into the pretties world to find her best friend. He is glad to see her but shocked that she is there. Uglies and pretties never mingle. She will return after her surgery to make her pretty and then they will resume their friendship. Emergency sirens and spotlights speed her exit from the perfect society. While waiting for her birthday, she meets Shay who shows her a world of blissful imperfections. Shay invites Tally to stay as she is and escape with her to a world where appearance is never seen as ugly.<br /><br />I have to admit, I held off reading this because I thought it would be a new version of an old Twilight Zone episode. Although the initial concept is there, it does not follow the same plot line. UGLIES explores the depth of the pretty-making-process and the unseen damage that is within the realm of acceptable failure.<br /><br />Mr. Westerfeld's writing is superb. The reader is swept into his world as if it were their own. The pace and timing are spot on with no sluggish moments and the tension builds perfectly.<br /><br />Although UGLIES is set in a futuristic world, the setting is not far removed from reality. There is never a distanced and cold feeling, except when Tally jumps into an icy river. The characters are believable and enjoyable and portrayed as intelligent teenagers who still face the awkward transition into adulthood.<br /><br />All elements for a good story are here and told in an enjoyable fashion. Scott Westerfeld has easily become my favorite YA author.<br /><br />CarolASpradling.com  author
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This Cd by John Mayer was everything I had expected.  Good listening and thoughtful.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Why this movie won any Oscar is beyond me. It has no plot. It is unconscionably long. It has the most irritating soundtrack I have ever heard. Basically it is 2 1/2 hours of Daniel Day-Lewis chewing the scenery (with a John Huston accent). Waste of money.
B000OQF6N6|3.0|Smashing Pumpkins-Zeitgeist ***<br /><br />I must say this album had a lot of potential. But being as it only contained two of the original members of the Smashing Pumpkins (there for this does not constitute a SP reunion) maybe that is why this albums sounds, feels, and did as bad as Corgans own solo/Zwan albums.<br /><br />Smashing Pumpkins have always been like Led Zeppelin for me in the sense that at times I am really into them and play their albums constantly and at other times I refuse to listen, read, or watch anything that has anything to do with them.<br /><br />I though this was going to be a great album, as the lead single 'Tarantula' is nothing short of fantastic. It is easily one of the very best songs that Corgan has ever written. 'Doomsday Clock' which opens the album is a bit pretentious but is none the less timely, is actually a really good opener. 'Bleeding The Orchid' and the tender 'That's The Way (My Love Is)' are actually pretty good if not boarder line cheesy. 'United States' could have been better though. 'Zeitgeist' which maybe the best song on the album sadly only appears on certain versions of the album. As for 'Neverlost' it is boring as is 'Starz' but only because it is something you would expect from a lesser act, even the spelling, spelled disaster (pardon the pun).<br /><br />What is sad is like I said it had great potential. The majority of Corgans lyrics are great even though some are so cheesy they make the guys from Boston look like poets. The guitar playing is also great through out. Jimmy Chamberlain is most impressive because his drumming is really the highlight of the entire album. But with all that promise the album still is going to fall in the delete bin of life next to Millie Vanillie, and Roger Clemens, as it should.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I don't know how to even put how much I loved this movie in words.  Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins did an incredible, and I mean INCREDIBLE job.  I never would have thought that a movie about death himself wanting to experience life could be this moving.  This movie will make you laugh and bring you to tears.  You have to watch this movie!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I began by actually watching this DVD before I started doing the program and really thought that the exercises looked \\"too easy.\\"  I will admit that there is nothing \\"easy\\" about this DVD, other than taking it out of the box and putting it in the player!  I started the workouts approximately a week ago and am amazed with the changes I have seen in my body thus far.  I have lost several inches around my waist and my arms are more \\"cut\\" then they have been in years.  I have also increased my strength and am able to do more than 10 pushups in a row...that for me, is a feat in itself.  I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who has a schedule like mine (working three jobs and involved in volunteer work) and is unable to spend time at the gym.  Jillian is an amazing trainer who motivates you each and every time you turn on the DVD.  I only wish I could have her in my home to kick start me in the mornings :)
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|More than \\"just another\\" REM record--as if that were a bad thing anyway.  A lot of political undertones, reminds me of Automatic for the People coming out before the 1992 election, only more obvious.  I don't always like that, but I respect the criticisms and challenges to the status quo that are peppered throughout.  The overall performance is energetic and as high quality as you'd wish for from these fine performers and musicians.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|Britney may be crazy but she makes music which never disappoints.  This CD was quite different from her others and had a few greats in it. Break the Ice is a song I cannot get out of my head and have to listen to every day.  If you were ever a Britney fan or still are go ahead and get it.
B000RZIGYU|5.0|With a cast of John Travolta and Nicholas Cage, you won't find a movie full of more action and suspense. This movie has a very unique story that will keep you coming back for more. The HD Picture is amazing. You can definitely tell they took the time to go back over to make the picture as clear as possible. A+ in my book, although I'm a big Travolta & Cage fan.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Just received this in the mail yesterday. Couldn't wait to get home and watch it last night, and it was everything I was hoping for!  I saw him on the AWAKE tour last year, and it was like re-living it again but better; the venue I saw him in wasn't as nice as Salt Lake.  I have all of Josh's DVDs and this one is by far the best!!!  He just keeps getting better and better with experience!  I will definitely see him again in concert!   Josh can do no wrong when it comes to that awesome voice; there's just no one to compare!  Can't wait for his next CD!
0374530718|5.0|This is my first philosophy book. I'm no 14- or 15-year-old, but I was so delighted and intrigued by the way an abstract subject is explained with such concrete examples, occasional good humor as well as the story within story technique used to illustrate some of the contemporary philosophical ideas towards the second half of the book. As a result, I've gone on to purchase my second philosophy book. And looking forward to learning more through more books and discussion with others.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this to anyone (young or old, male or female) who's new to philosophy and wants to learn it in a relatively painless way. By the way, the story (or history) is long, over 500 pages. And the book makes no pretense (in any way) to be literature. The subtitle says it all: A Novel About the History of Philosophy.
B00144VBBS|3.0|Back in 1993 the music industry was introduced to a new album from a man named Toby Keith.  The album, self-titled \\"Toby Keith,\\" didn't give the singer a look that screamed \\"star,\\" but the songs sure did.  The album produced four hit singles and was solidified platinum.  And a star was born.  Since then Keith's accomplishments in the music world have been phenomenal.  He's had numerous number one hits, and all of his CD's have sold gold, with most going platinum.  Not only did Keith become one of the biggest country singers in the music industry, he became one of the biggest singers in the music industry PERIOD!  Now, I'm a big Toby Keith fan, but ever since establishing his own record label Keith has been releasing a new album every year.  On top of that he's been in movies, TV specials, and contributed to soundtracks.<br /><br />While this may sound great, his CD's have been...let's say, mostly sub-par.  Yeah there is at least a couple of entertaining tracks, but if you took all the hits he's had since his last greatest hits album you'd have a decent album.  Not a great album, a decent album.  Which makes the inclusion of a third greatest hits CD a mere four years after the previous one puzzling.  Acknowledging that Keith hasn't had too many \\"real\\" hits since then is what most likely contributed to this being a career spanning hits album instead of a standard hits album.  So what is on this career spanning collection?  Well for starters it contains all the songs that were on previous greatest hits albums (as far as I can tell), so longtime fans who pick this CD can throw those two CD's away (or bring them to a used music store).  So \\"Dream Walking,\\" \\"I Wanna Talk About Me,\\" and \\"How Do You Like Me Now?\\" are all here.<br /><br />Some of his weaker \\"hits\\" like \\"Mockingbird\\" and the Willie Nelson duet \\"Beer For My Horses\\" even makes the cut.  Since these songs are making third or forth appearances I'll skip those songs and look at what's been added.  From what is (arguably) his weakest album, \\"Honkytonk U,\\" \\"As Good As I Once Was,\\" and \\"Big Blue Note\\" all make the cut here.  For me these are all poor songs...with the exception of \\"As Good As I Once Was,\\" and even that's not a particularly memorable tune.  From the brilliantly titled (though still very underwhelming) album \\"White Trash With Money\\" we get \\"Get Drunk and Be Somebody\\" and \\"A Little Too Late.\\"  \\"Get Drunk and Be Somebody\\" is a no-brainer, as I feel it's one of his most fun songs in years, and \\"A Little Too Late\\" is also a good song, so it's good to see them here.<br /><br />It's a shame that \\"Crash Here Tonight\\" (which was also featured on the \\"Broken Bridges\\" soundtrack) didn't make the cut.  No songs from Keith's Christmas album or \\"Big Dog Daddy\\" are here, so either those songs are being held off for the next greatest hits CD, or neither album produced any real hits.  The sole new song is \\"She's A Hottie.\\"  And I have to admit, it's pretty bad.  Now keep in mind, if this song was on an album filled with new material this wouldn't be an issue, but since it's the only new song on a collection of previously released songs, it stands out as a bit offensive.  I'll get to why in a minute.  So now here's the question: Should I buy this CD?  If you are a new fan, or have never listened to Toby Keith before, then the answer is yes, yes, and yes.<br /><br />While listening to the full albums will (naturally) provide a more complete and fulfilling experience, this is a great start to one of the best singers on the market.  Hardcore fans though...well, not so much.  Now, chances are if you are a hardcore Toby Keith fan you'll be buying this collection regardless of any review.  I understand, I bought this too.  That said, it's too soon for another greatest hits collection.  The fact that they had to combine these songs with the old songs proves that there wasn't enough new material to make a new CD.<br /><br />On top of that, the new songs included are fairly uninteresting,\\"She's A Hottie\\" is a lousy song that shouldn't have been released on this collection.  It's amazing to think that Keith knew he was only going to put one new song on this CD, and that this was the song he chose.  Was this the BEST he could do?!  Really?  I hope the extra workload doesn't cut into the quality of his songs in the future, but if this song is a glimpse into the future then I'm a bit worried.  Still, despite the questionable nature behind the release, this is a great CD for new fans of Toby Keith.  Old fans might want to stick with their current CD's.ouldn't have been released on this collection.

B0015XASFS|5.0|Josh Groban is the only singer that has every moved me to tears. His vibrant voice goes deep in your bones. You can feel his musics energy as if you are part of it. This live dvd gives you another glimpse into the passion behind his music. He moves you to tears and then to laughter. Well worth the money. Check out the Internet Edition [...] . You will get your moneys worth
B00005JPS7|5.0|This is a comic book brought to life.  This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.<br /><br />To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.<br /><br />I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.  All I can say in the way of a hint is \\"what happened to the reconstructed prototype suit?\\"<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them.
B0016HNOXQ|2.0|because you will more than likely fall asleep.    boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring boring     first off : i am a HUGE fan of portishead! i have eagerly waited for this cd to be released...what a disapointment! there are about 3 songs total that i can listen to without skipping halfway onto the next song.  i really am trying to give it the \\"ol college try\\" but it has become increasingly difficult..   i only gave them that extra star for trying to be different, albeit horrible.    sorry portishead...nice try...hopefully the remixes will be more on par of what we know & love of you!
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I don't know why, but I cannot stop watching this film.  Granted I think I like the Japanese with English subs version better, it is simply a breathtaking film.  It truly does justice to the franchise.  The extra goodies in this box set are awesome, especially the script.  The extras on the DVDs are great too.  Buy it!
B0018J2QB8|5.0|This has got to be the best series ever. At first I was a bit squeamish to watch a show that glorified a serial killer. But after the first seaon I was hooked. Through training from his foster father, he became a \\"dark defender\\", ridding the world of, well, killers. He lives by a code and never wanders from that path. He will never harm the innocent. This show explores the mind of a serial killer but at the same time looks into the psyche of us \\"normal\\" folk.    The show is very well written, at times giving Dexter a sense of humor, albeit dark. The twists and turns of the second season had me so enthralled, I had to watch all the episodes in a 5 day period. I just couldn't wait to find out what happened next. In fact, I ended up cheering Dexter on as he was able to perform his \\"craft\\" while being employed by the police department as a blood splatter analyst.    The show has made me wonder... If there was a person out there like Dexter, would it really be so bad?
B00127RAJY|5.0|Then you are checking out the best DVD for great fitness in a pinch. I have done workout DVD's before that state how in only 20 mins or sometimes even less you can drop weight and get back in shape. MANY of those DVD's have no clue on how to approach an actual doable approach to fitness than what Jillian has done. This DVD will have your heart rate up and muscles burning. If your like me and want a real 20 min workout to actually be effective then buy this DVD.   Now a quick little background on the DVD. The very beginning can be forwarded but then Jillian starts to discuss the workouts and you cant fast forward that. That is really my only gripe with this DVD. Jillian's workout plan is a 3-2-1 approach. 3 mins of Strength, 2mins of Cardio, and 1 min Abs. And believe me you each move Jillian incorporates into her routine is effective. There is no marching it out and having your heart rate drop so low that you feel like your cooling down rather than get revved up for another bout of cardio. Jillian does modify a few of the moves to make it simpler but if there is no need to cut back on anything. She won't. Her no nonsense approach makes me feel like I might actually change myself physically within a month. Thats pretty darn good. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for real results and real sweat!!!!
0446672653|1.0|An Ivy League Psychiatrist turns psychic. That is what this book is all about. Most recently, neuroscientists coined an explanation on the function of dreams. It was very similar to Sigmund Freud's explanation. Dreams are the ways our sub conscious minds resolve conflicts that arise daily in our lives. After multiple follow ups on many subjects scientists explained that most of our dreams are bad -traumatic - and that all this dreaming is aimed for us to bring resolution to our internal emotional conflicts. When you wake up during a dream it is usually a nightmare. Therefore, nightmares are dreams without an ending. An unfinished emotional turmoil. That is why we remember those more vividly. Sometimes those bad dreams repeat themselves many times before they are resolved within our minds. Here comes this Ivy League graduate of Psychiatry and turns science upside down to give us his mythical version of dream therapy. He claims that regression therapy is the way our souls talk back to us from many previous lifetimes in order to teach us lessons in love. He becomes a guru instead of a doctor and applies his version of Hinduism, past lives, psychiatry to his unsuspecting patients. Did you have a recent family loss? Don't worry, they will come back and meet you in another body. Did you help your girlfriend to have an abortion? Don't feel guilty, the soul attaches itself after birth or even sometime afterwards. HA!! Funny bologna!! Did you have a divorce or a break up with someone you thought was your soul mate? Don't worry, that soul mate has not awakened himself or herself to you yet!! It might happen in another lifetime. Is your shoulder unexplainably hurting? The reason: in a past lifetime someone stabbed you in the back!!The list of nonsense goes on and on!! Yes, after multiple regression therapies, the passage of time, and thousands of dollars later, these people moved on with their lives, overcame grieve, loneliness, insecurities, lack of confidence etc. Similar towhat would have been achieved through our nightly dreams and sufficient passage of time without the intrusion and manipulation of an overpaid illusionist.Our guru doctor simply added a touch of hope by replacing their reality with a dream of immortality. That made them feel safer. Helping these people to face mortality and admit and take responsibility for their own mistakes with the acceptance and knowledge of their human nature would have been too much trouble for this doctor. That would require honesty and having to convey his Columbia University learned knowledge to his patients. Apparently, this knowledge does not attach itself as easily as the body leaping souls that he \\"commands\\" during his regressions. Whatever works, I guess. Personally, \\"I would rather take the awe of understanding over the awe of Ignorance, anytime\\" - Douglass Adams. By the way, this book is written very poorly, it is very sketchy, aimed at an audience with the comprehension skills of sixth graders. The very gullible to whom this pseudo psychiatrist prefers to sell his baseless rhetoric.
0452289963|5.0|I have read a few of the reviews on this book and do agree with some of what has been said. I do feel that the writing in this book is a bit much but it really reminds me of going to college. You know when you sign up for a class how complicated it might be dependent on how far along the teacher has gone in their education. This is just my experience but I digress now. I do admit that Oprah's continued emphasis on this book in most of her shows 'guided' me to purchase this book. I feel that this book is not for everyone. There are some who will view this book as absurd and ridiculous but I think the simple message that is being portrayed in the book becomes obscured by \\"our\\" own view of the world much of what Eckhart would say of course would not make sense if someone approaches the book with a closed mind. I feel that after reading this book many of his interpretations of what the Buddhism beliefs are...Catholcism and Christianity, seem to simply a message that is so often turned upside down when attending church or trying to interpret these religions books on your own. I feel this book brings a simple and clear message on how to live your life. I don't think that someone should be on their death bed in order to achieve that sort of higher consiousness that takes place when one is about to cross over. Granted there are some chapters that dont seem quite clear to me but I regard those chapters as information that is not relevant to this stage in my life. I am a 24 year old woman living in Las Vegas with no children and am only dating. So some of this points will not really resonate with me. I feel some of the messages he states is to simply be. Inevitably you will have to think about the future for saving money...plans for a family. And the past will often times come into play when trying to move ahead in life. Past mistakes and lessons. But I feel that the past is done and the future has not yet begun and we only have right now. I can plan for the future, but to spend my entire day and every single minute dwelling on what I am going to do at my future wedding or who I am going to marry or what kind of kids I want to have or how is the stock market going to look or whatever the case is takes up SOO much energy. Focusing on past mistakes and dwelling on events that I can not change is also a waste of energy. The big message from this book is all we have is right now. Live for right now. This message is no different from people who have stared death right in the face and can live to tell the world. Or people who have everything they own taken away but still have their lives and their family. Like I said before why wait for death to come knocking or some majoir catastrope to jolt one's life into an abrupt awakening when simply keeping an opened mind and reading this book can bring to a greater awareness of whats real and important. I do highly reccommend this book and I also recommend going to Oprahs website and listenig to some of her classes on each chapter. Now these classes are a bit long but they do help to clarify some of Eckhart's more 'enlightened' writing style. People from all over the world come to discuss and ask questions. Many questions asked by people with similar conflicts with the book that the people here who give it low ratings have. So enjoy the book with an open mind. Go to Oprah's website to get more clarification. And if nothing works then keep on doing what your doing.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|The truly shocking thing here is that those (like me) who know every note of the oringinal TSRTS soundtrack will instantly notice that this is NOT a remaster.  Many of the songs are completely different performances.  If you were a novice listener to original soundtrack, you will likely not notice any difference.  But for the expert, the differences are readily apparent throughout.  Many little nuggets are now gone ...     I would have preferred them keeping the same performances.  But it is still beyond great.  Beyond REALLY great, in fact.  And they added so much more material not originally included.      Bottom line:  BEYOND AWESOME.  I am a hardcore Zep fan from wayyyyy back.  And this is my favorite Led Zep album of all time.  Yes, it is that good.  It deserves six stars.

B0000026VZ|4.0|The CD itself is a great collection!  I loved Toto when I was a baby and still do!  So I've been a fan for about 27 years.  I bought this CD and was excited because I honestly had thought about getting a Toto Greatest Hits for a Loooooong time.  When I opened the CD case up, the disc read \\"Suicidal Tendencies\\" and was an album by the same band...  I decided to pop it in the CD player, and it turns out Toto was just mis-labeled.  Did anyone else have this happen?  It's weird, but freaking hysterical.  That's the first time that's EVER happened to me.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Probably my favorite VH album. The first 6 albums of theirs are really must haves. But this one is different. From the cover art to the lyrics.  Eddies guitar solos are very cool here. A lot of other reviewers have summed it up pretty well. Highly recommend this record.

B0000028RR|5.0|Just look at the cover photo & the name of the band. One of the best records of all time. Different, inventive, fearless, revolutionary, sincere, solid, art at it's best. This is what rock & roll is supposed to be all about. Tom Morello is the most inventive guitarist since Van Halen. Love this band. Highly recommend all of their stuff.
B000YAA68C|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  It made me laugh and made me cry.  However, there aren't enough scenes with the delightful Gerard Butler.  He's very entertaining, and I wish they would have used him more.
B000000993|5.0|My soul must be iron... This record was so refreshing in 93. A band of true artists. The music is everything. This record rocks. Weird, arty videos that don't show the band at all. A frontman who is not a typical frontman. Performing Live, he is a shadow. Again, because it is the music, not the personalities or looks. I love that about this band. Buy it.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|This was a cute little romantic comedy set in beautiful Provence, France. The story follows a selfish and callous London stockbroker who inherits his deceased Uncle's vineyard. He has every intention to quickly unload the burdensome property for the largest profit possible, yet when he returns to this place of his childhood summers, it grabs a hold of him. There seems to be something magical about this place and it comes through clearly in this visually stunning film. Along with this magnetic setting, he also happens upon a charming and lovely young lady in the way of Marion Cotillard, the combination of which compels him to have a sincere change of heart. Throw in a newly discovered American cousin and the goofy French couple who take care of the estate and you have an entertaining little story.<br /><br />This tag team of Cotillard and French countryside is what really drew me in. I can't decide which one is more lovely, but I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a right-minded man who could resist the combination. Apparently, Russell Crowe was the star of this film but I didn't even notice, entranced as I was with the aforementioned duo. OK, I kid. You can hardly miss Crowe who is the main protagonist, and I think he does a good job in this brief departure from his usual role as a tough guy. I was also surprised to see that Ridley Scott was the director, as I am used to seeing him involved strictly in action-packed blockbuster type films.<br /><br />Some reviewers have said that if you love wine and France, you will love this movie. While this is probably true, I'm not into wine, and I've never been to France, yet I still found this to be an enchanting little film. Frankly, the story is a bit cliched, and there is nothing really original or earth-shattering here, but I found myself enjoying it nonetheless. A nice, pleasant movie to enjoy with your sweetheart, or just your lonely self. Four stars.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I don't know how many of you were teenagers when this came out but let me tell you the first time you heard this coming through the speakers it was a whole new sound and experience. Who the F#@% are these guys? Changed everything. Don't even hesitate to buy this.
0131479415|5.0|Mike takes agile planning to a new level with this one of kind book.  Its a pretty simple read, not to high level but enough detail to get you through in the weeds of your day.
1932907009|5.0|I bought this book recently and enjoyed it a lot. It made a good companion to a few other screenwriting books I have. I am an aspiring screenwriter working on my first script. I am a writer by profession but mostly marketing materials, proposals, and policy papers (so you can say I am a seasoned fiction writer already!). I recommend this book but as a companion to:    [[ASIN:0440576474 Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting; A step-by-step guide from concept to finished script]]    [[ASIN:0060391685 Story: Substance, Structure, Style and The Principles of Screenwriting]]    [[ASIN:1582973903 Writer's Guide to Character Traits]].     Happy writing!
B000ICLRIE|4.0|The only thing preventing me from giving this five stars instead of four is the fact that Fox opted to omit the two discs worth of informative supplemental material that they released with the four-disc regular DVD.  This blu ray version is a no frills, bare bones edition.  That said, this movie is amazing on blu-ray.  Ridley Scott has championed another great epic.    This is the extended director's cut too and not the substandard theatrical cut of the film which played in theatres.  If you saw this film in theatres and didn't like it, give it another chance with this version.      Again, the only thing missing is the treasure trove of supplemental material from the Regular four-disc DVD, which I'm finding out more and more that Fox is doing consistently with a lot of their blu-ray releases.  Bad form, Fox.  You better NOT do that with FIGHT CLUB, that's all I can say.    For those of you who never watch the featurettes and trailers and such, this version is tailor made for you.  It's a great film and looks fantastic on blu-ray.
B0016HMYEQ|2.0|The person controlling the \\"creative\\" aspects of Cloverfield should be beaten with the piece of rebar he impaled one of his characters with. People don't run around after being impaled on rebar for several hours. Helicopters don't fall fifty stories and then have three survivors emerge from within to run around waiting to die. For this and many other implausibilities that go beyond the realm of suspension of disbelief I take away one star. I award a second beating with a piece of rebar to the side of the director's face for trying to be artsy and I take away a second star because the stupid, idiotic and nauseating camera technique did NOT make the story any better, it made the film hard to watch instead.
0446343129|5.0|You have to read a certain section of this sometimes boring narrative to get the awesome part - what giving up sugar CURED!  I believe the author should have given the shocker first, then followed up with dry facts that the reader needs.    I've given copies of this book to five people who I care about!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!  I wish I could forget all the other Batman movies, even the ones that Tim Burton directed.  Although Michelle Pfeifer was pretty hot as Catwoman.  If only ALL Super Hero movies were done like this movie.  In my opinion this was even better than Spiderman. Even women that I know who don't like super hero movies love, that's right, LOVE, this movie.  It is basically a character driven drama with action.  And for once, the villains don't upstage the main character as they did with ALL the previous Batman movies.  If you are looking for a Super Hero movie that has it all, look no further.  THIS IS IT!  I can't wait to see the Dark Knight this summer!!!

B000JVT09C|1.0|When I saw Superman Returns in the theaters, I had hopes that it would be Superman with a more realistic edge to it (to reflect the darker Superman suit), basically a character driven drama with action in it kind of like Batman Begins.  What we got was more of the same campy, unrealistic, nonsensical approach that produced Superman III, IV, & V and the last 2 Schumaker Batman movies that almost killed the franchise.  I actually heard people groan several times DURING the movie and afterwards there was DEAD SILENCE.  I haven't heard that kind of lack of response from a packed theater for a Super hero movie since I saw the last Hulk movie.  To put it bluntly, IT STUNK!!!  AND now I'm hearing that there is another one in the works?  I would tell anyone who is interested in this not to waste their money, unless, that is if you like campy movies and a good laugh.  Buy either the first TWO Superman movies (both are on blu-ray), or better yet, buy BATMAN BEGINS (coming to Blu-ray in July) and see how a REAL super hero movie SHOULD be.
B000ETQPYM|5.0|I just finished watching the movie and it reminded me of how much I loved this story.  While the movie was good on it's own, when compared to the book, the movie is lacking.  I thought the story was well written and I loved all the hysterical situations Holly and her friends got into.  The entire story is relatable no matter how old you are, single/married, male/female.  I laughed, cried and on many occasions did both at the same time.  This was a great debut for Cecelia Ahern.

B00005JMJG|4.0|I've been a fan of Jim Carrey since I saw Ace Ventura as a kid... but I always knew he was capable of doing MORE. He's an amazing actor with a wide range of skills, and although he's great at comedy, it's nice to see him do something different. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind does have its funny moments, but overall it's a serious film. I really love it.<br /><br />As for the story itself, the main characters meet and have a rocky relationship because they're so different, but still very attached to each other. We've seen that before, right? But Carrey and Winslet still execute it beautifully... and then things stop being so predictable when Clementine (Winslet) decides to erase her boyfriend from her memory. Completely.<br /><br />From there, it becomes an emotional rollercoaster ride. I'm not convinced that anyone could play the parts better than the actors who did. This is really a great movie, especially if you're looking for something more than your average romance film.
0760700451|5.0|A wonderful Jane Austen book. This is one of my favorite books for the time period and the wit that is spoken through out the whole book. Of course the book gives so much more detail than the movie so I definitely say read or listen to the book before watching the movie!
B000BT97AO|4.0|I bought Mirrormask on a whim, mainly so my order would be over $25 so I could get free shipping. I wasn't expecting much out of it - but I was pleasantly suprised. It's a beautiful story, and it's not a plotline that has been done to death like so many recent movies. Basically, it's about a little girl whose parents own a circus, and she wants to \\"run away and join real life\\" - quite the opposite of most kids, who want to run away and join the circus - but instead she gets caught up in a dream world, full of strange creatures from her own artwork, that is infinitely more mystical and unrealistic than her life at the circus.<br /><br />Because it is a Jim Henson Company production, I was really hoping for puppets, but there don't seem to be any. All the creatures appear to be CGI. However, in the dream world, all the humans wear really great costumes and masks. Still, the movie was not disappointing, and I've recommended it to several of my friends.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I know this is not a new movie, but I only recently purchased it.  This is one of my all-time favorite Jane Austin novels and the movie lives up to the book in every way!  What I love about Austin is her ingenius plots and think about it: you don't realize she's hooked you completely until the end of the movie/book when you're on the edge of your seat.  Now THAT is brilliance.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
0312932081|5.0|I first read Ender's Game in highschool, when a friend passed me an old, worn-out paperback copy of it.<br />I instantly fell in love.<br />I've never been heavily into science fiction, and you don't have to be to understand Ender's Game. There are no complicated scientific or unbelievable things going on. It's all about the characters, the story, rather than dazzling you with things that would translate into over-the-top special effects. It's beautifully written, without being confusing. How could you not love Ender, the brilliant yet lonely kid who is being trained to save the world? His emotional and mental struggles are very real and I easily identified with him.<br />I was absolutely ecstatic to find out there was a hardcover edition out. I still have the old, torn-up (and slightly mildewed...) copy my friend gave me years ago.<br />The hardcover edition is definitely worth a few extra bucks though, especially for long-time fans. There is a new foreward by the author himself that gives some insight into how the story was born and what it was like for someone to write their first futuristic/sci-fi novel.<br />I definitely would recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading.
0757307272|5.0|Teens will definitely relate to this book. Healy and Canfield have done an excellent job in writing about the things teenagers need and want to know about succeeding in life. The book is filled with real-life examples, amusing illustrations, and space for writing one's personal challenges. This book is like a mentor for teens.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|Before I bought the movie, I read the reviews on it. I have to admit, after some of them I was scared to buy it fearing that it would be a total disappointment. However, I went for it anyways! And I am SO pleased that I did!! It was incredibly sweet and appealing! The actors did a terrific job of putting you in the moment, especially through the tension and sadness of the events. In fact I love this movie so much, I am now back on the amazon.com site to buy a copy for my mom for mother's day!    ... Yes! It's that good!
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|This album has all the greatest hits, but the reason I gave it a 4 star rating is because it is targeted toward a country music audience.    For those who like the rock sound in Shania's albums (like me), you may be disappointed.  For example the song \\"That Don't Impress me Much\\" is missing its famous guitar solo in the background, and \\"From this moment on\\" is missing the vows in the beginning.    The new recordings are great, but are pure country, in content and style.  Personally, I prefer the depth of Shania's mix of rock and country like in her hits of \\"Ka-Ching\\" and \\"Man, I feel like a woman!\\"  I'll be waiting for her newest album release.
B000002KLZ|4.0|I caught them on the way back from the Asia portion of the Tusk tour that was the basis for this live album in Mar 1979. Lindsay's performance on I'm So Afraid left me in awe in a way that has been hardly breached since. The performance on the album doesn't quite compare to live, but that is engineering and ambiance. It does capture the power and energy of the band at it's peak and in the raw, unlike the crisp productions in the studio.    BTW, I was also fortunate enough to catch Clapton on the Slowhand tour about the same timeframe. Dates are a blur, but the music resonates. Also Bob Marley, Blue Oyster Cult, and some other notables.
B00169XU8I|1.0|Where do I even begin? It's so lame, a huge difference in price from the standard edition, and all you get is a bag of cheap peppermints. Two extra songs, but nothing special about the book, and no lyrics! Trust me it is not worth the extra SIXTEEN bucks. Get the standard edition and buy yourself a nice bottle of champagne and chocolate to have while you listen to it.
B000001E3V|5.0|I hate to reveal my age, but I saw Derek and the Dominos at the Fillmore East, during the late show, when some or all of this was recorded. It was EVEN SOLD OUT, because only those who read magazines like Circus and Rolling Tone knew was Derek was. There was NO marketing.<br />I was thrilled to see that the concert was as good as I remember.I saw Clapton several times before and after, but NOT like this.<br /><br />What a fantastic, high energy tight band. I have never heard Clapton play with the kind of high energy that he played with for this concert. It is truly amazing. He starts jamming for a few minutes before a song starts and they were long, tight, incredible high, high energy jams, with a fantastic tight live band. Truly, the best band that Clappy has ever played with.<br /><br />He was very inspired, really by the longing in his life, as well as this was the first time he was the front man for his own band !! He also was so tired of the idiotic idol worship that was going on and wanted to have his own band, play his music and through Derek, he learned that he could front his own band.<br /><br />At many of their tour, the late, great Duane Allman was there as well, but not at this show, not that it mattered at all. In fact, it may have been a plus to hear Clapton really at a level of energy that he has never played with again.<br /><br />He also was doing lots of jamming at the time with the Allman brothers, who were at the TOP of their game. Their Live at the Fillmore CD at about the same time is one of the greatest live CDs ever made. They might have a 20-30 minute song, just jamming away.<br /><br />This is part of what inspired Clapton on this.<br /><br />I am SOOOOO glad they found the original tapes from this show.<br /><br />It is a must, must, must.<br /><br />I wish it could have been a three CD release, but sssh, don't get greedy, for finding what they found and creating the quality of the release, is really a miracle.<br /><br />Rockin Eric with his great, great band. I think most of the band has passed away unfortunately.<br /><br />Jon<br /><br />I havtunately.    Jon      I hav
B000Q6GUTI|1.0|I wish I could tell you if this was a good movie or not. /there is always a risk buying these used, or foreign generated DVDs. This one never played for us. I actually just bought it again at the local Target, as I felt bad for my Dad about the other one. It was a gift he was never able to enjoy!
B0015XASFS|5.0|I have watched this DVD two times since buying it yesterday and I must say it is by far THE BEST of all of Josh Groban's DVD's! The entire concert is excellent, but it is worth the price alone for the live version of the song \\"Awake\\"! If you are a Josh Groban fan, this CD/DVD is an absolute must have!! It blows his other DVD's away!
B000W4D94I|5.0|What about the outbreak of tornados in the same area depicted in the film a week ago? 40 tornados over the same area in the span of 10 hours: that makes this movie look like a picnic. Still say it's not possible? There are people in tornado alley that will beg to differ.
0307265730|5.0|Being critical and judgemental, I am usually moved to write a review when I think a book is being over praised. In this case, overpraising is impossible. While lacking the elusive, magical dimension of The Interpreter of Maladies, these stories may be even better in their depth, warmth, and maturity.    As is usual in Lahiri, the stories focus on people raised in two cultures, Bengali and American, and not feeling fully a part of either. An additional theme of this book is withdrawal and withholding from others, failing to make a vital connection. This is illustrated often by withholdoing information. In the title story, an aging, widowed father withholds the secret of his new found independence and love affair from his adult daughter while on a visit to her home where he bonds with his grandson. In \\"Only Goodness\\" a wife withholds the secret of her brother's alcoholism from her husband until it is almost too late. In a third, part of a linked series of three stories, a family withholds the knowledge that the mother is dying from the family that shelters them in American. In this case, the secret deepens the bond of the son and daughter of each family.    I did not want this book to end. I wish she would write more.
0060254920|5.0|According to the characteristics of picture storybooks, this is a high quality book. The text and illustrations equally convey with the storyline. The shape and size of the book is rectangular and does not have page numbers. It includes all of the literary elements. The book's strength is its illustrations. The book received a Caldecott Medal for its illustrations. The author does a nice job of telling the story through the illustrations. The illustrations get larger as Max's imagination grows and start to decrease in size as he returns home. The colors in the beginning of the book are duller than the end of the book. As Max's feelings and mood change, the pictures get brighter. The book's reading level is 3.4 and geared toward a lower grade interest level, however, can be enjoyed by older ages. One concern is that there are monsters in the story even though it is a children's book. Introducing this book to primary students may lead to questions and misconceptions. One instructional activity to handle this situation would be to talk about the monsters. Ask Were they scary? Did they change? Show the pictures of Max being carried by the monsters and the way they dance and play. Talk about feelings and emotions (the monsters and Max were not sure about each other at first, but then they grew to like each other and play together). The students can then draw monster faces depicting an emotion.
1932100660|2.0|Do your research before accepting this as proof that a Vegan diet is the solution. After chapters touting his credentials, Campbell glazed over his research to try and prove that a Vegan lifestyle is the most healthy. Many of you may know unhealthy Vegans and like me find a conclusion that Vegan is the most healthy diet hard to believe at face value. So I did a review of those reviews that gave this book 1 star. C. R. Moulis \\"Christina Moulis\\" thankfully went through some effort to review the real research. Read her review.    I give this two stars because of the research and thought it has sparked me to do since I read it. And I applaud any Doctor who is willing to research Nutrition and try and identify what is \\"healthy\\". However we unfortunately live in a world of advertising and I feel that this book is more of an advertisement than giving the whole story. He mentions a study using rats and animal protein, or casein (milk protein). But we never know if these were powders or raw milk from healthy animals. Or if the animal protein talked about is from a plant grazing animal or one that is  fed in a feed lot with the cheapest food available.    After reading,[[ASIN:0967089735 Nourishing Traditions:  The Cookbook that Challenges Politically Correct Nutrition and the Diet Dictocrats]]   I felt enlightened. The notions and diet suggestions make sense. If we lived in a culture that still raised our own dairy (raw) and meat, we could be more healthy. And we would probably reduce the intake of meat because of the difficulty and unpleasant job of butchering and cleaning. However, most Americans are not able to live this way. And many must be careful because of the number of individuals with dairy allergies. But I can't accept that God didn't intend for us to eat cheese, yogurt, and even ice cream. I'm not suggesting an abundant consumption but in moderation it is just a food that can't be evil due to the pleasure it provides our palate.    For the summer months when one can plant a garden and eat fresh without spending a fortune I have no doubt that a Raw Food Diet would be ideal. [[ASIN:0974896306 Living on Live Food]]    But in winter when fruits and vegetables are in short supply we need to augment our diet in order to sustain good health. [[ASIN:1600850219 The Food You Crave: Luscious Recipes for a Healthy Life]]    However I do believe that more research will soon find that high animal protein diets are not healthy, they just don't make much sense. Even Whey and Soy Protein powders just don't seem right. Humans were not created to drink powder. I feel like a pirate on Davy Jones' crew when my food is turned to powder. Eating that way just is not pleasant, food was created to satisfy and fulfill our natural cravings. But in order for the cravings to be more natural you must detoxify.     I look forward to the day when we can get the real story, that is not tainted by lobbyists and propaganda. When Nutrition, Health and Medicine can congeal together so we can have a healthier society. For now I will continue to search and use my own gut instincts to help me find truths from falsehoods.
B0018CA996|3.0|First, does anyone else get a weird whiff of Emerson, Lake and Palmer from this record? I don't know if I mean that in a bad way or not.     Second, I like the fact that this record helps me to understand what I like about Portishead in the first place--they took hip hop and made it sound like it was invented by crazed, prescient studio musicians after a Dionne Warwick recording session in the mid-60s. It's not time-travelling hip hop any more; now it sounds like the crazed, prescient sidemen were tuning in, I dunno, Joy Division. No matter how dismal and cold it may be musically, I think that sonically it has an warmth, or maybe an organic feel that I just don't hear very often any more.     As much as I like the way it sounds, I don't think it is a great set of songs. But I'm not completely sure about that; I am listening for the third or fourth time, and some of them are growing on me.
B000002B7O|5.0|That's right folks, this album not Master of Puppets, not Paranoid, not ZOSO, not Machine Head, not Back in Black, is the greatest metal album I've ever heard in my life.  Why?  Because this is the fullest extent of the heavy metal experiment, an experiment started in the late 1950s to today.  It isn't about how heavy the album is, how ridiculously virtuosic the guitar solos are: it is about mood.  This album is the epitome of metal; it has both crazy thrash your head metal music and dark oh my I think I'm insane music.  The definition of the heavy metal album.

The journey takes him to a magical land, Stormhold.  Upon arrival at the site of the fallen star, he discovers that it is actually a celestial maiden, Yvaine.<br /><br />Unknown to Tristan, there are others who want the star.  Lamia, one of the three ancient sister witches, seeks to capture this star as it contains a \\"fountain of youth\\".  And, nothing will stand in her way.  Meanwhile, a dying king sends out his sons on a mission.  Whoever finds a ruby becomes the next king.  The sons race out for the ruby, killing anyone who gets in the way, even if they are their own brothers.<br /><br />Once Tristan and Yvaine realize what's going on, they're on the run.  While fleeing, they soon find attraction towards each other.  Eventually, they get help from an aerial pirate, who has a secret of his own.<br /><br />What can I say?  Wonderful fantasy, filled with love and magic which will have you cheering for Tristan and Yvaine to flee for safety.  There are no cheesy factor, which makes this movie all more endearing.
B00005JPS7|5.0|I believe one of the best things to happen to the big screen was when they started filming Marvel Comics. Honestly, I'll go see an action-adventure or science fiction fantasy film on the big screen over any other genre. And the Marvel classics translate very well to film, particularly if you have a writer like Peter David doing the novelization.     The story in brief:  when Star Industries CEO and wunderkind engineer Tony Stark (Downey, Jr) is kidnapped by terrorists, he builds an Iron Man suit to escape rather than creating the missile they demanded.    Back at home, he decides to convert Stark into a more politically correct company and 'make peace instead of war.'  He hadn't reckoned with the terrorists re-arming and deceit from his own camp.     The acting's great. I think Terrence Howard (Colonel Rhodes) is going to be the next Denzel Washington.  He's a good actor and easy on the eyes. Jeff Bridges broke out of type and served as a pretty amazing Obadiah Stane.      The imagery is fabulous. Scenes from Stark's capture were gripping.  His fellow captive, Yinsen (played by Shaun Toub) was an interesting and sad character, such a waste of a brilliant man.      The soundtrack is particularly good with strong, evocative musical images. Okay, I wish they'd used Black Sabbath's version of \\"Iron Man\\" for the soundtrack, but that's already been used by both \\"Detroit Rock City\\" and \\"Lords of Dogtown.\\"     Best of all, for a vertigo sufferer like me, there was minimal monkey cam.  I could follow almost all the action without a problem.  Both my husband and I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Iron Man\\" and may well see the film again before it leaves the big screen.

B000063JZQ|1.0|I purchased this with the intention of showing it to my senior English class,but when I previewed it, I decided that I would NEVER put my students through the torture of watching this ridiculous version of Shakespeare's Macbeth.  From the beginning it was boring, but I thought I would give it a chance.  About the time I got to the part where Macbeth goes a second time to see the witches and they were old, saggy and naked - I was done!  What a waste of money!

B0013FSXT6|5.0|Being a fan of Kubrick's movies, this movie is not the best of the bunch, but strangely this movie grows on me everytime I see it. EWS is like movie no other. I haven't seen another movie like it, mostly because of it's dreamlike quality. Seems like many people don't like this movie and I think it's because the pace is slow. As a matter of fact when I saw this in theatre, there was a person who commented the movie most the time saying \\"this is boring\\" etc.     I recommend this movie to people who wants to see something different...if you have seen it, watch it again...maybe it's better on the second time.
B000YABYLA|1.0|If fatherhood is NOT an important consideration in your life or our culture you will love this 'adorable' movie: It has everything the Hollywood crowd loves.    Because I am a father and I feel fatherhood is as important motherhood I forced myself to watch all of it.    In a few words, this movie is horrid and a sad commentary on the American society.

B000ASDFJU|5.0|OK, call me shallow, but I loved this show, which I think should have been called: Shoes and the city.     The perfect female fantasy: 4 good friends, eating, shopping, looking for love, complaining about men... and then the best part... after 6 seasons, they morphed into Dangerous Housewives--yep the same formula with a great dash of mystery.    Whoops, back to Shoes and the city. I've watched every episode. I love these women!
0060935464|5.0|A friend in New York called to say, \\"I just listened to To Kill A Mockingbird on tape. There's a lot of funny stuff about education and John Dewey. I wouldn't have understood it if I hadn't read all those articles on your site.\\"<br /><br />Now I had to order this book. I had avoided it all these decades because it was such a Teacher's Pet; kids are made to read this novel because it says all the right things about racial injustice. Well, I read it, and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's good history (Alabama, 1935); good sociology; and good story-telling, lightning in a bottle, actually.  But you probably know that. So let me mention a funny irony. Public schools make kids read TKAM, but TKAM is a tough critic of those schools.<br /><br />My friend exaggerated; the bits about education hardly add up to three pages. But they are delicious! The set-up is that the narrator, Scout Finch, age six, is off to her first day of school on page 15, with this thought: \\"I had never looked forward more to anything in my life.\\"<br /><br />But there's a problem: she can already read, at a high level. The teacher, discovering this fact, looked at Scout \\"with more than faint distaste. Miss Caroline told me to tell my father not to teach me any more, it would interfere with my reading...'It's best to begin reading with a fresh mind. You tell him I'll take over from here and try to undo the damage...Your father does not know how to teach.'\\"<br /><br />That's so pretty, you might want to cry. An entire cosmos of educational stupidity is right there. Scout goes on: \\"I mumbled that I was sorry and retired meditating upon my crime. I never deliberately learned to read, but somehow I had been wallowing illicitly in the daily papers.\\"<br /><br />At lunch Scout tells her brother she wants to quit school. He reassures her, \\"Don't worry...Our teacher says Miss Caroline's introducing a new way of teaching. She learned about it in college...It's the Dewey Decimal System.\\" According to Scout, this consisted \\"of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed `the,' `cat,' `rat,' `man,' and `you.'\\" That, of course, is Whole Word; and we are still fighting this crabgrass 70 years later.<br /><br />Scout is bored so she writes a letter to a friend. Miss Caroline catches her and says: \\"We don't write in first grade. We print. You won't learn to write until you're in the third grade.\\"<br /><br />You can see what a deft touch Harper Lee has. It's sweet, and sly, and scathing. Melvil Dewey, by the way,  created the Dewey Decimal System. That little inside joke is one example of what I mean by \\"sly.\\"<br /><br />As for Professor John Dewey, he has caused a lot of trouble. I like to think that Harper Lee and I are in total accord about this guy. Discussing Miss Caroline's origins, Scout notes that the teacher was from a part of Alabama that was full of \\"Liquor Interests, Big Mules, steel companies, Republicans, professors, and other persons of no background.\\"ted \\"of Miss Caroline waving cards at us on which were printed `the,' `cat,' `rat,' `man,' and `you.'\\" That, of course, is Whole Word; and we are still fighting this crabgrass 70 years later.<br /><br />Scout is bored so she writes a letter to a friend.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love friends, the acting, the actors, the plot, the humor, the friendship, the lifestyle--everything about this series.  I also really like the way they joke around, joke about each other--the way true friendship should be. The whole show is hilarious. And every episode would reflect a real life event. I not only love Friends, but I learned a lot--especially about American culture.    So, yes, if you have not seen it, get it.
0517118297|4.0|I just ADORE Jane Austen's book (well, perhaps not all the novels in the same way...) and I can find just a fault in this book: it's too heavy to read it at bed!<br />By the way, the quality of the paper and the binding is poor, but the book is cheap and the ratio is, all in all, good.
B000000Y2F|4.0|I really want to adore this CD.  After all, it features two of my favorite musicians.  And there they are. Monk being inventive and playing his angular style of piano.  Coltrane as smooth, fast and inflective as ever.  Both instantly reconizable and remarkably their uniquely genius selves.  But, after repeated listenings I keep coming away from this collection feeling a sense of detachment.  Coltrane is better, way better elsewhere.  And McCoy Tyner or Bill Evans lay me out cold accompanying him on piano.  And Monk too is more the distinctively Monk and better on other efforts. And most shocking, Charlie Rouse (gasp!) sounds way better to me playing with Monk than Coltrane does.   Yeah Monk & Coltrane, like so many dream team combos, is a great concept, but in this case the result just doesn't shiver my timbers.  Sure its good.  It almost has to be with these two giants involved, but its not great like so many other examples of these guys' work.  But hey, maybe some new Monk Trane session tapes will surface and those will be the ones!  Boy, I just can't wait!
0756404746|5.0|I read a great deal, but few novels move me to write a review.  This debut novel from Patrick Rothfuss prompted me to do so.  Let me tell you why.    After reading the 1st installment of The Kingkiller Chronicles, and checking to see when the next was due, I ran to the local store (sorry Amazon, just couldn't wait) to pick the 2nd novel up, only to find that I misread the release date, scheduled for April 2009.    I can speak to the developed characterizations, the fine plotting, the intriguing world-building etc...instead I simply point out that I was the first one on line (apparently) for next year's release.  Draw your own conclusions.
B000059ZLH|4.0|Not a bad DVD. I think I may have hyped myself up to expect more than what it actually was, or something a little different than what it is, but even though it wasn't what I anticipated, it's still good - it's still Dream Theater.<br /><br />I think I expected more of a straight-forward live coverage of a concert video (like the way LIVE AT BUDOKAN was shot), rather than so much multi-angle inset shots with all kinds of video effects to give it different feels of psychedelica and what have you.<br /><br />I did like the film noir portions that helped illustrate the story, and this is what I expected more of, since the METROPOLIS tour/concert was a complete performance of the enitre epic concept album from start to finish. However, I really expected more theatrical content, be it actors and props on-stage (all there was of that, was one actor reading the spoken parts of the Therapist), or more video footage on a bigscreen backdrop (more \\"film noir\\" and less \\"psychedlica\\").<br /><br />I was only going to give this video 3 stars, but I decided to give it 4, cos I am sure once I watch it a few more times, I will come to enjoy it more, despite it not meeting my expectations. I may even wish I had given it a full 5?<br /><br />WTW
B00005JPS7|5.0|With each decade, the dark heart of Comic Book Adaptations beats a little faster. Ever since Tim Burton made his version of [[ASIN:B000B5XOY8 Batman]], super-heroes have made our nights in the theater all the more exciting and thought provoking. Now, with Marvel Comics' taking the studio reigns on \\"Iron Man,\\" they've done something totally new. \\"Iron Man\\" is the rare comic book movie that stands apart from its origins, a movie that could have been made without a back-mythology, and a film you can go see without previously knowing anything about the source material.<br /><br />A great deal of this has to do with the casting. Robert Downey Jr, as billionaire Tony Stark, brings enough snarky humor to his conflicted billionaire playboy genius that you totally fall for the act. As his rival Obadiah Stane, Jeff Bridges obviously relishes getting to play baddie. He's all oily charm and malevolence, and watching is descent into the Iron Monger is a marvel (pun intended). Speaking of Iron Monger, the suits, oh the suits. When Tony Stark perfects the second Iron Man outfit (with the help of his AI companions), it really will make you believe he can fly. Even with the CGI, the suits look realistic and hot.<br /><br />The suits do battle and it's better than the [[ASIN:B000VR0570 Transformers]] fights (which were both done by the same company). The other \\"training exercise\\" shots, like the one with the fighter planes, are pulse-racing fun. The gadgets are worthy of a Bond Film, and the humor that slides in helps give the movie balance. (Like Stark's commentary to his robots during suit tests, for example.)<br /><br />Balance is also achieved by the rest of the cast, including Gwyneth Paltrow as the loyal Pepper Potts and Leslie Bibb as reporter Christine Everhart. Terrence Howard (who is underused) plays Stark's best friend Jim Rhoades. Stan Lee makes the obligatory cameo, and the assorted bad guys are, well, the current middle eastern terrorists du-jour. (It is worth noting that the ultimate evil-doer here is not a foreigner...)<br /><br />All in all, a great Good Vs Evil night at the movies, down to the Black Sabbath finally popping up in the credits. And was it me, or did the end credits pay homage to [[ASIN:B00005OCMR Tron]], a movie Jeff Brides just happen to be in?  I also have to - as everyone else here has stated - remind everyone: stay through the credits. \\"Iron Man\\" kicks the summer blockbuster season off with a bang.oer here is not a foreigner...)

0452289963|3.0|A New Earth is a book that I believe is worthwhile as it has created so much hype, and is changing people's lives. I didn't finish the book, and I will try to do that. Some of it went over my head, but I do encourage folks to read it if you are trying to become a better person with a life more fulfilled.    Coming out of your own egostistical self and learning to understand your true purpose in life are things that take time and to have the will to challenge yourself to that degree is commendable. However, for me, I must get back into the book, try to understand it more and maybe I will be able to move further.    The author's efforts are noteworthy.

In the news, I would hear how the tabloids and the royal family would speak about Diana.

B000002KET|4.0|Despite what the blurb above says, Black Sabbath cast off some of their gritty bombast to produce a more measured and experimental effort with Sabbath Bloody Sabbath. The killer riffs are still there, but a little of the high-volume was replaced with some high-fidelity. I initially found this disappointing - it is nowhere near as viscerally exciting as the Paranoid album for example - but it was necessary to make space for the plethora of other instruments & ideas to take hold. As such the listening experience is more complex and more interesting, but with less raw energy.    Others have done the detailed track analyses & I don't intend to repeat them here, but I would take issue however with the claim that the track \\"Fluff\\" is a misstep: far from it. Apart from being a worthy musical contribution in its own right, it provides a wonderful counterpoint to the heavier material on the album. They did a similar thing with \\"Changes\\" on Volume 4, and these quieter interludes have become a feature of Black Sabbath's releases. Not only is Tony Iommi the ultimate riffmeister of his generation, but he is also aware of the overall listening experience, providing a kind of aural intermission. This album-oriented approach is typical of a lot of 70s records where singles success was spurned in favour of a more wholistic musical goal.    The 70s influence of prog-rock really comes to the fore here too, with some of Sabbath's most interesting and experimental material. As is the nature of prog-rock, some of it is a little challenging, but it's fascinating to hear them try. And who could be a better partner in this endeavour than Yes boardsman Rick Wakeman? How I would love to have been a fly on the wall during these sessions to see the creative process at work.    An album of its time, and one that stretched Sabbath to the outer reaches of their creativity, and arguably to places they have never revisited (except perhaps briefly on the follow-up Sabotage). One of my favourites.

0141187379|5.0|Not long after George Orwell wrote HOMAGE TO CATALONIA, a famous friend of his remarked to him, \\"You've turned what could could have been a good book into journalism.\\" Orwell, who could take it as good as he could give it, agreed that this was the case, but added that if he hadn't been thinking journalistically when he wrote it, it never would have been written at all. In an essay called \\"Looking Back on the Spanish War\\" he later admitted that his motivation for writing HOMAGE was not to relate his experiences as a volunteer foot-soldier on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, but rather to blow away the fog of lies which surrounded the conflict and tell the unpleasant, politically incorrect truth: that the Loyalists, darlings of the political Left and supposed champions of freedom, were nearly if not equally as villainous as the Fascists, and were, even as Orwell was writing, murdering in large numbers many of the foreign volunteers who had come to help them fight, merely over a difference in political orthodoxy. HOMAGE was written objectively as possible, but also in great anger. If it is journalism, it's muckraking of the very best sort.<br /><br />HOMAGE begins with Orwell, in Spain to cover the war for a Leftist newspaper, abruptly deciding to throw in his lot with a Loyalist milita group called the Party of Marxist Unification, or P.O.U.M. In the early stages of the civil war, the democratic government relied very heavily on militias formed from the ranks of the Spanish trade unions to supplement its regular fighting forces (most of the Spanish Army had sided with the Fascists), but its relationship with the militas, were Socialist, Anarchist or Communists in persuasion, was strained and uncertain. Sent to the front at Aragon, Orwell quickly discovered that the mistrust of the government was preventing the militas from being properly equipped - he describes them as virtual rabble, lacking uniforms, sort on rations, and using outdated weapons. On leave, he also discovered - a recurring theme not only in HOMAGE but all his later writings - that there was a substantial difference between what was actually happening at the front and what was being reported both in and out of Spain. Objective truth seemed to be fading out of existence; each political faction, including all of those on the Left, had its own version of what was really happening, with actual events being rewritten or ignored depending on one's leanings. When his own group, the P.O.U.M., fell afoul of the government, Orwell was appalled and infuriated at how quickly Leftist university professors in England declared everyone fighting for it to be a Fascist spy and refused to be persuaded otherwise. He saw cowards lauded as heroes, heroes denigrated as cowards, major battles reported where there had been no fighting, and heavy fighting subjected to complete historical blackout. The idea that a completely fraudulent history of the war was being written frightened him, but not merely so much as the idea that an \\"accurate\\" history was not going to be possible, because regardless of who won, the winning side would write only lies, and those lies would, to the future generations raised on them, become the truth.<br /><br />HOMAGE is partially a battle memior, but Orwell's fighting experiences, which included being shot by a sniper, were secondary to the grinding realities of trench warfare on a neglected front - lice, cold, hunger, exhaustion, and boredom. He paints a vivid picture of war on a shoestring budget, but the book is most notable for his description of the Loyalist's suppression of the P.O.U.M. by force, an act which led to street fighting (a civil war within a civil war) in Madrid and very nearly cost Orwell his life. Slipping into journalism mode, Orwell tries to trace the causes of the fighting and the motivations of the government, while simultaneously documenting his own desperate struggle to escape the police and get out of Spain alive. Theatmosphere of political orthodoxy, hatred, lies, hypocrisy, privation and terror he experienced during this time were fuel for the fire that later became \\"1984.\\"<br /><br />HOMAGE isn't a perfect book by any means, but it is classically Orwellian - tactless, penetrating, honest, thorough, and decent. It provides the reader with a depressingly clear picture of how petty political rivalries on the Left helped to hand victory in Spain to their worst enemies, the Facists.olitical orthodoxy, hatred, lies, hypocrisy, privation and terror he experienced during this time were fuel for the fire that later became \\"1984.\\"    HOMAGE isn't a perfect book by any means, but it is classically Orwellian - tactless, penetrating, honest, thorough, and decent.

B000YABYLA|5.0|Juno is a masterpiece; there really is no other way for me to put it. It is, at the same time, one of the most witty films, fun, and emotionally draining films made within recent memory. How is it possible NOT to like this film? Everything about it is done with such heart, honesty, and realism that every second glows and shines with brilliance. Along with the great film [[ASIN:B000FVQM2Y Brick]], Juno is probably THE best independent film ever made (well, at least that I've seen).<br /><br />The story starts out with Juno, a likable, sarcastic, awkward high school teen who has just discovered that she is pregnant. She decides, instead of having an abortion, to have the baby and give it up for adoption once it's born. She is far and away the best part of this film. The plot may be a little reminiscent of [[ASIN:B000TZJBPQ Knocked Up (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] but it doesn't rely on cheep comedy to drive film forward; instead it utilizes its extremely likable and believable characters in a way which sets this film above most others of its kind. Juno, her father, step mother, boyfriend, best friend, they all play a critical role in the film and present viewers with a realistic portrayal of everyday American life in a small town with nothing to do. Despite their obvious problems and character flaws, despite Juno's flippant remarks like calling her baby a \\"sea monkey\\" that she \\"needs to let cook in the oven (her womb) a little longer\\" before she can give it to the adoptive parents, they just become more and more likable as the film progresses. The relationships that are developed and elaborated upon during the film, in their subtle ways, build tension better than any action movie could ever do.<br /><br />If there is a movie in 2007 without a flaw, that film will be Juno. Not only one of the most quotable films I've ever seen, but one which captures the atmosphere of small town conflicts in a most realistic manner. Do not go into this film looking for deep hidden messages, unique film techniques, or dramatic over acting; simply enjoy it for what it is, a slice of life in a small town. Why on earth did I decide to see Rambo 4 in theaters instead of seeing this gem of a film?<br /><br />Replay value; VERY high.film techniques, or dramatic over acting; simply enjoy it for what it is, a slice of life in a small town.

B00008PC2O|5.0|What a great film to get at such a low price. There was a real fast delivery. This Extreme edition of T2 consists of  disc 1 featuring extended edition of the film in obviously different better transfer than on ultimate edition and disc 2  featuring two short documentaries and T2 High definition which is not playable outside US and Canada. I'm from Europe  and cannot obtain some kind of a license for playback of the HD portion. This extreme edition is worth having because of the  sharper image of the extended edition of T2, but those fans who seek documentaries and interviews better look for Ultimate edition.  In my opinion a true Terminator fan must own both editions. Also the packaging of this edition is much better than of  the ultimate but it's a shame that there's no booklet. I guess you get what you pay for, but still this is a must-have.
0393316041|2.0|Although Mr. Feynman is undoubtedly a smart man, with many things to credit to his name, this book seemed like nothing but his attempt to show how smart he was and is.  However he comes off as extremely arrogant and pompous, the problem being that his anecdotes are ruined by his comments on how stupid others are compared to himself.  Almost every other paragraph is a story in which he felt he outsmarted someone, but in reality, his accomplishments seem very exaggerated and insignificant.  The way he talks about not being considered a sissy by struggling against his frat brothers, outsmarted the waitress with dumb puzzles, and outwitted his frat when stealing a door are NOT impressive in the least, and I feel that a average person could accomplish the same things.  The fact that he writes about it in a manner so that he tries to make himself some child genius is what ruins the book and makes him seem stupider rather than smarter.  I'm sorry Mr. Feynman, you may be a great physicist, but you must be joking if you think you're a writer, and a clever one at that.  I may not be able to solve physics problems like you, but I can assure you...I am much more clever if compared to your life stories (and that's not saying much).
0061245097|5.0|I loved the first book in this series but I have to admit the ending left me a little worried. The author could have easily ruined the series by continuing along a pointless self sacraficing, give up the love of your life and whine about it the whole rest of the book senario. For some reason authors love to do that and it drives me crazy. But nope, Frost proved she has the talent to take a great first book and keep it going the way a good writter should. Cat and Bones still kick butt, and the storieline continues to evolve. Jeaniene Frost is quickly moving her way up my favorite author list and I think her books are going to end up with a permanant place on my \\"keeper\\" shelf. Can't wait for the next one!

0593057023|2.0|I have actually `met' Lee Child at two different book signings and had the book signed. I have read all the Reacher novels and enjoyed them.  But, I'm with the previous reviewer on this one. This book was difficult to get into. The storyline is getting a bit too familiar. How many bottoms can Reacher kick and how many beautiful 30 something's does he meet and bed? It's just that the storyline wasn't that interesting and the ending was a bit too far-fetched.  I was on a bit of a tear re-reading chronologically the previous Reacher novels, and was up to Persuader when this came out. So I feel I am well placed how this fits into the oeuvre. It is one of the lesser Reacher novels, and I have rated it on that basis.  Maybe it's time to look at Reacher from a different angle, maybe his life growing up and early years in the Army. Or how about meeting up with Jody Garber again? In England.  Random thoughts. But what do I know.
0385338724|4.0|Sophie Kinsella's [[ASIN:0385338724 Remember Me?]] reveals how changes to one's life can be bad, as well as good. The novel centers on a young businesswoman, Lexi Smart, who wakes up in a hospital after a car accident and cannot remember the last three years of her life. The last thing she remembers is that it is 2004 and she was out with friends at a local bar the night before her father's funeral, having fun before she fell down a set of stairs.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert***<br />Lexi wakes up and her mom is the same she ever was, but her sister has grown up into a teenager. Lexi cannot believe her eyes; her little sister has grown up and is a sarcastic, budding criminal. She also finds out that she is married to a hot stud, who happens to be a millionaire and knows how to drive a speedboat. This part of the description cracked me up. Why would it matter if he can drive a speedboat, but I guess it does to Lexi who is obsessed with all things material. She also discovers that she is now the director of her department and is a total B**ch boss who has lost all of her friends, including those she remembers from the night at the bar in 2004.<br /><br />She struggles to remember any part of the last three years, including her time on a reality television show, much like the Apprentice. But she cannot remember a thing. To help Lexi out, her hot husband, Eric, gives her a \\"marriage manual.\\" The manual spells out how often they have sex, how they have sex, how she greets him, how they say goodbye in the mornings, how they initiate foreplay, etc. It is a step-by-step process to their relationship and marriage. A bit overwhelming for a woman with amnesia, but beyond that the manual makes their marriage seem more like a business transaction.<br /><br />Throughout her re-acclimation to her \\"new\\" life, Lexi learns that she also was having an affair with Eric's business partner and architect, Jon. Jon, who claims that they are in love and were on the verge of telling Eric, cannot believe that she does not remember him. Moreover, Lexi must return to a job that she does not feel comfortable performing and cannot imagine ever being capable of performing. Worse yet, her subordinate, Byron, is after her job and wastes no time putting her down when she returns from the hospital.<br /><br />Despite her best efforts to save her job and her marriage, Lexi fails to save her department, but in the process finds her inner businesswoman and learns how to be independent and self-sufficient without injuring her friends. The part that is the most accurate in the book is that she fails to fully regain her memory by the end of the book, though there is a glimmer of hope.<br /><br />***End Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this journey with Lexi Smart.

There is a significant disconnect between the woman she was in 2004 and the woman she became into 2007.t remember him. Moreover, Lexi must return to a job that she does not feel comfortable performing and cannot imagine ever being capable of performing. Worse yet, her subordinate, Byron, is after her job and wastes no time putting her down when she returns from the hospital.    Despite her best efforts to save her job and her marriage, Lexi fails to save her department, but in the process finds her inner businesswoman and learns how to be independent and self-sufficient without injuring her friends. The part that is the most accurate in the book is that she fails to fully regain her memory by the end of the book, though there is a glimmer of hope.    ***End Spoiler Alert***    I thoroughly enjoyed this journey with Lexi Smart. She may have changed her life in the three years she cannot remember, but she changes the most in those months following her car accident more profoundly than she did after her father's death.    I'm not sure I would want to remember myself if I had changed so utterly in those three missing years.

0060775858|5.0|This item of psychedelic literature appears charming at first, with its depictions of traditional Anglo-American décor and its rhythmic treatment of a soothing bedtime ritual. But closer inspection reveals subtle dangers for the young mind.  This is not just the story of a rabbit-child going to bed, saying goodnight to everything he sees.  This is the story of a mind on edge, of the dissolution of temporal reality.  What is there is not necessarily there, like the red balloon that disappears in the middle of the book, only to reappear at the end.  Or the socks on the drying rack, inexplicably gone.  Or the painting of  the moon-jumping cow; sometimes we see a mailbox there, sometimes not.  The number of books on the bookshelf changes, throwing the very notion of objective perception into chaos.  If one cannot be sure of where one is or what is in front of him, how can he be sure that he is anywhere at all?  \\"Cogito ergo sum\\" offers little comfort in a world where the self has no ground to stand on.      But the ultimate threat to the unsteady mind is on the rabbit's nightstand, where a copy of Goodnight Moon rests ever so humbly.  Imagine: a book within itself, within itself, within itself, to infinity. What tricks this could play on a young reader who, sitting in his room alone, mind dimmed with fatigue, only wanted to say goodnight to that lovely bowl of mush!  Oh that tasty, tasty mush.  Just like mom makes, with the raisins and the brown sugar.  Or you always thought she made, but now you can't be sure.        Highly recommended as a sink or swim test for curious young minds.  Also consider Common Psychological Disorders in Young Children for parental reading.
B00004SYWZ|5.0|I owned the first 3 a-ha albums and enjoyed every song. But a-ha seemed to drop off the face of the earth in the 90s.  Then when I read on the internet that a-ha was putting out a new album in 2000, I was estatic. But the only way to get it in the USA was to import it, Thank God for Amazon!  I must have played this CD continuously for a year.  It's a good album, but like all albums it has it's weaker tracks. But if you are an a-ha fan even the weak ones sound good if it has the chemistry of the three members of the band.
0143038419|1.0|I was surprised at how disappointing this book was.  I lived in Italy for over 5 years and was really looking forward to reading a book that might capture the essence of living in and experiencing Italy.  I agree with other reviews that the author's insights are actually annoying, cliche, \\"pat\\" (used this way: so glibly plausible as to seem contrived [...], cloying, superflous, shallow, and just fake.  I have read better books by expatriates of true Italian experiences, insightful, inclusive, with depth and true self-discovery and growth (the book, \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", by Frances Mayes (long before the movie came out) or \\"An Italian Education\\" by Tim Parks.  And yes, I'm only reviewing the Italian section, because its something I know about, and its as far as I can get.  BAD READ!!

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Madonna cranks it up with her hottest dance album since \\"Erotica\\".  Talk about re-inventing yourself.  Madonna is the queen of trend and don't u forget it.  She's always got her hands on what's hot, a lil bit ahead of her time everytime.  \\"Candy Shop\\" is near perfect album with all of it's production value.  It never misses a beat, all of the dubs and breaks are in the right place and it even does a little overtime just when u think it's over.  Madonna was in good hands with the writers and the producers, they took her music to the next level and it works.  This cd is one of those that grows on you, it's hooky, bouncy and intense and Madonna gets waaaaaay into the groove.  M' fav tracks are \\"Dance 2Nite\\", \\"Incredible\\", and \\"She's Not Me\\".  Here is my complete breakdown of each song:    Candy Shop: 5/5  4 Minutes: 3/5  Give it 2 Me: 4/5  Heartbeat: 5/5  Miles Away: 4/5  Incredible: 5/5  Beat Goes On: 4/5  Dance 2Nite: 5/5  Spanish Lesson: 2/5  Devil Wouldn't recognize U: 2/5  Voices: 3/5
0321525655|5.0|Most books on using presentation software seem to start with the assumption that the software makes sense and that organizing content is the secret to a good presentation. Here, Garr Reynolds strips away those assumptions and asks you to think of presentations as they truly are--visual stories. They're more like movies than books and Garr opens up the possibilities through a radically different approach to designing slides.<br /><br />The book offers many beautiful examples and an engaging and reflective style that inspires you to create truly impactful presentations. These principles are particularly important for government communicators.
B000R8YC18|3.0|I can see why people love this movie and why others hate it. Taxi Driver is a mixed bag for me, parts of the film I find interesting but there are some slow and boring sections for me as well. Robert De Niro is a fantastic actor, this is his defining role. Jodie Foster is also good as well, she plays a young streetwalker and De Niro's character tries to save her from a life on filth and suffering. The ending is pretty good but I still unsatisfied with the whole film, it's an unique flick but not a classic, I prefer Raging Bull instead.
0765348276|5.0|Easily on of my list of the top 5 sci-fi books of all time, Old Man's War is sublime.     The sci-fi elements are top notch with a somewhat unique (and not unfathomable) twist on the \\"supersoldier\\" theme generally used to great effect in books like Armor and Starship Troopers.    The story made me care about the well-developed characters and interesting missions. Scalzi really drew me into this universe. No character was the whiny \\"Here is the emotion you should be feeling\\" person used by lesser writers.     The following two books, Ghost Brigades and Lost Colony, are excellent. Ghost Brigades has excellent action sequences and Lost Colony has a more political feel to it.     This series should be a \\"must read\\" for any sci-fi fan.
0061139378|4.0|Super creepy! For some reason it reminded me of  A Fine and Private Place by Peter S. Beagle, but even more macabre. Gaiman knows how to create dark, foreboding settings like in his  Neverwhere and he delivers the same in this story, which seems to be marketed as a children's book, but adults would definitely enjoy it.
B000H5TVKI|1.0|there is nothing HD quality about this in any way. Your better off just gettin the DVD. I looks like they've edited some swearing /gore etc. Very dissapointing!!!!!!!

0385338724|4.0|Frizzy haired, jagged toothed Lexi Smart has an accident and wakes up in the hospital to find she has forgotten the past three years of her life. To confuse the matter more, she is now thinner, perfectly manicured with gorgeous hair and teeth and married to a handsome millionaire. She's the boss at her company, lives in an amazing flat and drives a fantastic car - but she has no idea how she's come by any of it!    Lexi is determined to fit her old self into the new life she has been given, but as she struggles to put together the missing pieces of her memory, she finds that things aren't as perfect as they first appeared. She must decide not only how to live the life she created for herself, but learn if she really wants to.    I enjoyed this book and thought it was a cute story about being true to oneself. Though it was not as humorous as some of Kinsella's other work, Remember Me? is a fun and entertaining novel.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I just saw La Fille Du Regiment two days ago at the Metropolitan Opera and the music hasn't stopped playing in my head. After having seen Natalie Dessay as the tragic Lucia Di Lammermoor, it was amazing to see her comedic performance as Marie, the mascot of the regiment. The lyric beauty of her voice is as astonishing as her Chaplinesque routines. She is the Tomboy daughter of the regiment, ironing their clothes, peeling their potatoes while singing of her love for her adopted \\"fathers.\\" In addition to Dessay's breathtaking coloratura arias, Juan Diego Florez's effortless nine high Cs make this opera a veritable showstopper.  The melodies are glorious, the singing and acting are flawless. Donizetti must have had a ball poking fun at his own tragic operas. My only disappointment was the unimpressive set design, which did not detract from my overall enjoyment.
B000WC3AKI|1.0|I don't know if I would've forgiven this movie more if I hadn't had an amateur meteorologist with me when I saw it or not.  But I did.  And his constant interjections of \\"that would NEVER happen\\" got so annoying that I finally had to say:<br /><br />\\"Hey, I never went to Weather School but I KNOW that couldn't happen!\\"<br /><br />My hopes were also high since Michael Crichton's name was on the screenplay.  But then again, so was his wife-at-the-time listed as a screenwriter.<br /><br />But what really got me was that this Hollywood monstrosity had an opportunity to use the best sound and state-of-the-art visual effects to show the raw power and terrifying danger of a real tornado...and they instead chose to pay endless homages to THE WIZARD OF OZ.  Have you ever been in a tornado?  I have.  Nobody's pausing to calmly and safely watch barnyard animals float by.  This movie totally trivialized that stark terror.<br /><br />Whatever tires were on that pick-up truck that Bill Paxton drove around with Helen Hunt and Jamie Gertz had to be magic: somehow houses and tanker trucks could be tossed around like crazy--but not that pick-up truck!<br /><br />Storywise, you can also see everything coming from a mile off.  I'll bet everyone can guess how the relationships will end within the first 20 minutes.  Characters are so broad that I wondered if the two groups of scientists were in this movie or if they were the two competing summer camps in MEATBALLS.  Of course the bad scientists--and they're bad because they drive new black vehicles--are going to suffer the most at the hands of nature.  Of course the leads will have their happy ending.  Of course the tornado will strike the drive-in movie theatre when Jack Nicholson sticks his face through the door in the clip from THE SHINING (I knew that was going to happen as soon as they showed the movie marquee).<br /><br />If this movie had Jerry Bruckheimer or Michael Bay's name in the credits, I wouldn't be able to be so critical.  I just expected more from Michael Crichton.
B000286RKW|5.0|Along with the recent Oscar winner \\"The Departed\\", Scorsese has given us 2 great gangster thrillers along with his seminal \\"Mean Streets\\". Ray Liotta will probably never have a greater role than this since he has since fallen into doing B-movies or straight to video features. And Joe Pesci's Oscar performance as a psycho hood ranks up there with the best of Cagney. A little long perhaps but filled with juicy details of the mob and of course, DeNiros excellent performance. Also the HD DVD version of this classic adds a certain sheen to it all, though on Casino, it's even better
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Cloverfield doesn't promise much and delivers an enormous amount. The conceit of the film, dubbed \\"the first great horror movie of the millennium\\" by one critic, is that the destruction of New York as seen, more or less accidentally, through the lens of a hand-held video recorder. A gaggle of irritating Yuppies have come to bid a fond farewell to one of their friends who has accepted a job in Japan (home of Godzilla, natch). The idea of a hand-held camera, brutally beaten to death in The Blair Witch Project a few years ago, works very well here, as the lens is small enough to capture only parts of what is happening as the Big Apple gets chewed, making the audience's imagination do all of the work. And, as the early Universal horror films used the horrific memories of the maimed and tortured from World War I, Cloverfield uses the memories of the destruction wrought by 9/11. The conceit of the amateur video---no music, just stark reality---brings immediacy to the proceedings that really work. If it is the job of a horror movie to entertain and scare the bejesus out of an audience, Cloverfield succeeds beyond its wildest dreams.
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Hard to believe that as a 45 year old I am only just discovering how great Led Zeppelin was!  The funny thing is that way back when; when the music was being played for the first time and garage cover-bands were doing their best to capture LZ's essence at pool clubs, I thought Plant's voice was as annoying as a cat being strangled!  And now!  Wow, I am so enjoying \\"getting my Led out\\".  For their time they really were pretty revolutionary.  Spiritual, psychedelic, demonic, and violins too!!  If you don't already have all their music on CD or if you're only just now becomng a fan then this collection is for you.
B00005MP58|2.0|The bBC A&E production is the longest and most lavish of the Pride and Prejudice films I have viewed. It fleshes out Darcey's character, which is helpful. The production is accurate in its recreation of dances, songs, etc., as well as being precise in its details in showing the contrast between the Bennetts and Bingley's higher society companions. The actress Jennifer Ehle (Elizabeth) brings a sweet and fun quality yet she appears much too old to believe that Lizzie is \\"not yet 1 and 20\\". Though Ehle was 24 at the time of filming, she is a very mature 24 and would have suited playing a much older character, someone in her thirties. Colin Firth displays the right combination of emotions and you delightfully follow the subtle yet apparent changes to his behavior and character.<br /><br />The biggest criticism of the production is the overall too mature ages of the main characters as well as a lack of distinction of accents between the classes of characters. Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Darcey would NEVER have spoken the same accented English!
B000WTNCYA|4.0|A few songs are a bit Norah Jones-ish (not that there's anything wrong with Norah), but some have a really great sound that's mellow and cool.
B000VZGK4O|4.0|This is probably a milestone in Leonardo DiCaprio's acting history!! Outside of this being his second film with Scorsese, the film marks a definite maturity in his acting that I haven't seen even in their first colloboration, the flawed \\"Gangs of New York\\" (though Day-Lewis was superb in it). Especially in HD DVD, the scenes are glitzy and the sound is phenomenal especially in the near fatal plane crash of Hughes which the director filmed to perfection. If you loved the era of the 30's and 40's (I'm sure Scorsese does too), you'll love the details in this off-beat bio.  Cate Blanchette is superb also in her Oscar winning role as Katherine Hepburn. So 4 stars for cast & director and 5 for the HD transfer. In total 4 and half stars!! Also take note of how Scorsese changes the color transfer from old 2-strip Technicolor to the more conventional color scheme of today--this is meant to quell people who complain of his use of color in their criticisms of this fine film.
B000WMFZNS|2.0|Samuel Bronstein's El Cid is the epic to end all epics Released in 1959, it tells the story of the famous 11th-century hero who fought to unite Spain. Clocking in at just over three hours, it is sumptuous beyond description the cities and plains of Spain---with lush costumes and an even lusher  Miklos Rozsa score, it becomes almost too much of a good thing. With Anthony Mann directing, the audience is given not only the enormous spectacle of history parading across the screen, but also Mann's incredible ability to capture the intimate and personal drama of every day life. The drawback, and the only thing that makes this less than a perfect movie, is the two stars. Charleton Heston and Sophia Loren may be lovely to look at, but 180 minutes of alternately bad (read: wooden) acting gets a little tiresome. More than any other film genre, epics require special handling, as filming larger-than-life creations frequently bleaches all life out of the character. This is very much the case here, where the two leads are simply not equipped to deal with the scope or the reality of the characters. The supporting cast, including Herbert Lom, Raf Vallone and Hurd Hatfield, is quite wonderful---or at least serviceable. This new \\"Limited Collector's Edition\\" ---clearly grammatically challenged, or how many \\"Limited\\" collector's do you know?---comes chockfull of commentaries, still galleries, filmographies, trailers and \\"bonuses\\"  reproductions of original souvenir programs, comic books and window cards. The only thing missing? A good leading man and woman.
B000Q6GXW2|1.0|An admission: I couldn't watch more than 10 mins or so of this, so this review is clearly an unfair one on that level. But . . . this is rubbish. Got it \\"free\\" with the Toshiba player, and I am sure there are thousands of copies out there for cheap. Don't waste you money. Gratuitous violence, ultra pretentious, and the most stilted acting you have ever seen. This sort of movie would be great for proponents of censorship. Not because censorship is a good idea or anything like that, but just because if this movie were to be banned the world would be - fractionally - a better place.
0757302661|5.0|This book originally was only available when you signed up for the classes. Hence, why you see class referenced a lot. It is a great start, but will not replace going to the classes, which are not only invaluable for practicing relaxation, but in life as well. All good books always reference seeking additional information \\"from a professional\\", including all the baby books that you have been reading. My recommendation: buy the book; read it; if it makes sense to you, then sign up for the classes. You will be a part of a changing movement in Western birthing practices!
B000X5SPBI|5.0|the third season of supernatural is awesome and definitely the show is getting better and better as time passes....its got everything: horror, suspense, mystery, action and most definitely humor...can't wait to see how the season ends...  also its great to see how far the characters have developed...I'm glad there weren't any crappy episodes (no thanks to you WGA)  ghostfacers!!  (haha that episode alone makes me want to buy this season)
0380730367|4.0|...or I'll have to quit you now...it's the admirable hallmark of british mystery writers not to hurt the cat (or dog), or your readers will depart. Of course, please spare the children too...but still, when I encounter cruelty to animals in fiction  the whole experience is marred and lessened. Yeah, it's a real gotcha for sympathy but a cheap shot.    Otherwise I totally agree with the brilliance of the story and pacing, plus the audio reader is sublime.
B00138JBMG|5.0|AFTER RANDY'S DEATH THIS WASN'T A BAD ALBUM. OZZY WAS JUST TRYING TO FIND HIMSELF. THERE WAS A LOT OF GREAT SONG'S ON THIS ALBUM ANYWAY. ESPECIALLY THE RIFF'S THAT JAKE E. LEE CAME OUT WITH WHERE GREAT RIFF'S. SHOT IN THE DARK WAS A MELLOW BUT HARD HITTING SONG JUST LIKE LIGHTNING STRIKES AGAIN. YOU CANNOT FORGET THE HEAVY GUITAR PLAYING ON NEVER KNOW WHY ESPECIALLY THE SOLO ON THE END OF TRACK. AND THE LAST SONG I'M AM GOING TO TALK ABOUT IS THE ULTIMATE SIN, THIS WAS A GREAT SONG TO OPEN THE ALBUM OUT WITH BECAUSE IT HAD A LOT OF GREAT DRUM BEATS ON IT ALSO GREAT GUITARING. SO IF YOU ARE A FAN OF OZZY I WOULD BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
0307388840|5.0|One of my favorite novels ever, I read it before it was made into a movie. The story is so romantic and engaging, two lovers that have only a few minutes together to share in their whole lives because of a person's false accusation, three lives destroyed due to ignorance and childish egoism. I loved both the part in the Tallis' family house before the dramatic change of events and also Robbie's efforts to reach Dunkirk (that was almost lost in the film). I couldn't see the end coming... I think that final twist in the story is what made this great book brilliant. I absolutely love Mr Mac Ewan's way of writing, so fluent, so natural and efficient. He is one of the most talented authors today as far as I am concerned. I hated Briony and at the same time I could get into her mind and understand why she acted as she did. I have been urging many of my friends to read it ever since, and those who did, have all thanked me! I read On Chesil Beach lately, perfect writing as well. I like that Mac Ewan's novel get you into the process of thinking... all those \\"what if's\\"... you're not done with his books even when you're through them, they stay in your mind, in your heart. Don't skip it just because you saw the movie, this book's just perfect.
B00140PK6O|5.0|Cranford aka the Cranford Chronicles, based on Elizabeth Gaskell's story is a stellar production. It is a lush period drama and is very authentic in its portrayal of people living in a little hamlet called Cranford. The sets are beautiful as are the costumes, and of course the production is elevated to a level of excellence by its impeccable casting.<br /><br />Writer Heidi Thomas does a wonderful job of adapting Elizabeth Gaskell's story [purportedly based on Gaskell's own hometown] and though liberties are taken, the stellar cast more than makes up for whatever deficiencies there may be in the faithfulness of the adaptation. Dame Eileen Atkins [Miss Deborah Jenkins] and Dame Judi Dench [Miss Matty Jenkins] portray two spinster sisters in 1842 who live in the little town of Cranford. Far from being a quiet little hamlet, this little town hums with activity and village gossips, especially a Miss Pole [Imelda Staunton]who flits around from one hearsay to another, avidly passing on any little nuggets of gossip to the other inhabitants.<br /><br />Cranford is set aflutter by the arrival of a new doctor, Dr Harrison [Simon Woods] who is young, handsome, single and very much into trying new methods of treatment, to the initial consternation of the townspeople. Dr Harrison finds himself attracted to a beautiful local lass, Sophy [Kimberly Nixon] though he inadvertently attracts the romantic affections of other single women in Cranford.<br /><br />But the story does not merely focus on romance, as there are other more serious themes underlying the series. For one, there is talk of a railroad being built that would go through Cranford, and disrupt the idyllic life in the village, giving rise to the inevitable battle between modernization and the desire for things to remain unchanged. The local rich lady, Lady Ludlow portrayed by Francesca Annis is very much opposed to change, and not only opposes the railroad but also any form of societal change, such as literacy amongst the lower classes [she refuses to hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].<br /><br />There is also the theme of lost love, death and grief. Miss Matty Jenkins[ Judi Dench] finds herself recounting the tale of her lost love [played by Michael Gambon]. This is what makes Cranford such an engaging viewing experience - the absurd [the story of the cat swallowing an anitque lace and how the lace is retrieved] is interlaced with tales of poignancy and everything unfolds leisurely. It is a tale that we wish will never end, and hope to revisit again and again.o hire a maid who is literate, saying the girl's parents did her a disservice by teaching her to read].
