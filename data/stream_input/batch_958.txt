B002Y5210G|5.0|this album has a good beat and wonderful songs, perfect for a fan of hers. i loved it and its a little bit more speeded up then her last album  As I Am.
B002YMNI9W|5.0|Waiting and waiting for an uncensored version of the single disc \\"The Fame Monster\\" to come out on its own, I kept my eye out for the import versions of the 2-disc set and noticed that MOST of them have two bonus tracks, Disco Heaven and Retro Dance Freak, that aren't on the US release (why does the US release always get cheated???). So I figured, I might as well go for it and get the import version. Got the best price on the Korean edition.<br /><br />Sadly, this isn't going to be the place to get the uncensored version of the songs on the absolutely awesome \\"The Fame Monster\\" CD. What's SO weird about this situation is that first of all, the included lyrics in the CD booklet have the explicit lyrics printed in them. Not to mention, the songs on \\"The Fame\\" do NOT censor explicit words, so it's not like the record company was trying to make the release more `kid' and `family' friendly.<br /><br />As for \\"The Fame\\" CD, the first thing you'll notice is that the order of the songs are slightly changed up in comparison to the US release. But no big deal for me. As for the bonus tracks on The Fame, \\"Disco Heaven\\" is a fresh break from her standard radio hits, which all follow the pop electro/house formula. This one is a bit funkier, almost disco, but with an 80s-vibe as well. Retro Dance Freak is more of the same! It actually reminds me somewhat of early Prince.

B000002MG1|5.0|When this album first came out in the Fall of 1992, it was a clear masterpiece from front to back. It flowed throughout and impressed with each additional listen. It fit the mood of the early 90's and was a great soundtrack driving in the car, as background at a house party, or listening alone at home.     Looking back now, it doesn't have the same resonance that it once had for me, but after 6 more R.E.M. albums, it still stands as their best work. Strangely or not though, when compiling personal best of REM CDs, songs like \\"Hairshirt\\" from Green, \\"Welcome to the Occupation\\" from Document, and \\"Country Feedback\\" from Out of Time rise well above everything here except for \\"Find the River\\", which is easily the best song on the album. \\"Nightswimming\\" is a close second. As a complete album though, it is R.E.M.'s best, and is worth whatever the cost.

B0002YJ29O|4.0|Invaluable info and opinions have already been given, with which I largely agree.  And of course I bought the disc for the Bach, which did not disappoint in the least.  Here's what I have to add:<br /><br />The Mozart K521 (duet with Argerich and Kissin) has always struck me as pretty trite.  But these two play the hell out of it, and it is truly fascinating to watch their technique up close as well as their cheerful interaction.<br /><br />The camera-work is at times overly busy, but mostly quite a good balance of tasteful and interesting.  They showed me quite a bit of what I wanted to see, which is no small feat when navigating 4-8 pianos.<br /><br />I'm afraid Lang Lang doing seemingly everything in his power to get more attention than his 7 costars (by sheer theater) was rather nauseating.  Thankfully, he is completely absent from the serious works on this disc!  He only plays in the big 8-piano arrangements.  I much prefer the humble approach taken by... well, everyone else on stage.  They are consummate professionals.  It's really fascinating to watch their faces as they respond to their own and others' playing; it's like a mini personality survey of the major players in the piano world.<br /><br />The Rossini, Wagner, Benjamin, Gottschalk, and Rimsky-Korsafov offer no surprises and little value beyond the novelty, unless you just love background music, medleys of bland popular melodies, Lang Lang, and that sort of thing.<br /><br />However, the Morton Gould \\"Stars and Stripes Forever Suite\\" (arranged by Michael Rot) was a delightful surprise!  Musically, again, nothing to write home about (though more substantive than the pieces I just mentioned), but here's where the camerawork and the ensemble dynamics really came together.  When I think of the unique texture and visual possibilities of a piano extravaganza, this is what I imagine.  For example, lovely shots across the four keyboards aligned on each side, showing eight arms at once (or sixteen in a gimmicky but effective split-screen shot) in synchronized/syncopated movement.  And lots of technique to wow at, since Gould/Rot demands quite a few pianistic tricks, which are accomplished with zeal and joy.<br /><br />So I'd hazard to say if you are looking at this page in the first place, you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of the disc.  One last thing:  I actually found a clip from this concert (from the Bach) on youtube before I even knew the DVD was available.  Poor quality of course, but a great way to see if this stuff will strike your fancy.nchronized/syncopated movement.

B002QGUFWE|1.0|I love music, I live for music, I have a serious audiophile set up, but when did popularity = music?  Has anyone actually listened to Lady Gaga's music.  It's terrible.  I wouldn't even comment on her dumb looking hair cuts, strange clothing or virago voice.<br /><br />I've seen a bunch of teeny bopper singers and one-hit-wonders become popular, but can someone please explain to me how this talentless repeating record ended up becoming popular.  I mean seriously, compared to today's other top selling album by Susan Boyle, at least Susan has a background in musical training and a voice that doesn't sound like Joe at the loading dock with blaring subwoofers.  Does repeating an annoying beat endless times, over and over and over make for good music - is this part of the strategy of the promoters to drown out her rash voice?<br /><br />I just don't get it and refuse to get on the populous bandwagon.<br /><br />What ever happened to Deborah Harry \\"Blondie\\" at least she had talent and a repertoire of songs that all didn't have the same muffled and endlessly repeated reverb.<br /><br />I'll pass on this no talent phenom and count the days until she just disappears...
B002RSDW80|4.0|Julie & Julia is a film about the parallel lives of two very different women who share a similar hobby. Julia Child is a expat in 1960's Paris with modest origins who develops into a world-famous chef. Julie Powell is a lost Gen X-er living in present-day NYC desperate for an outlet in her life. She stumbles onto Child's enormous Mastering the Art of French Cooking and begins to write a blog detailing her life and luck as she goes through every recipe in the book (yep, that includes aspics- ick). The two storylines are quite different but share similarities, as Child tries to improve her cooking skills and get the cookbook published, and Powell gets more consumed with what was once an innocent hobby in the hopes of being taken seriously as a writer. That's the gist of the film, which is very fun and great to look at but not offering much else. Meryl Streep, of course, is a standout, in a performance that is by turns mannered and lived-in. She elevates the film to a higher level by her lighthearted presence and careful optimism. Amy Adams, on the other hand, comes right out of the Eat, Pray, Love school of aimless NYC women with a slightly sophisticated way with words. In the end her enlightenment is nice enough, but is ultimately bland. Still, the film is highly entertaining, and is as light and enjoyable as any dessert available in Child's book.
B00275EGX8|1.0|Do Not Buy This Movie ! What a waste!! Three reasons to avoid this film: 1. It was directed by a clueless woman. 2. It only grossed 12 mil at the boxoffice and 3. The never fails, dead give-away for lame movies: The critics liked it. They could have been honest by putting those perennial losers Julia Roberts and Jennifer Anniston in camo bdu's, surrounding them with the usual cadre of beta-males and having a good \\" Hope and Change\\" cry-in under a humvee. If you're looking for a good military/war action movie...this ain't it. This chopped-up, silly and altogether useless story is an affront to every member of our heroic military. What else can you expect from hollywood. Three strikes...they're out.
044654146X|5.0|Beyond Clusters: Review of Dan Senor & Saul Singer, Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle (Twelve, 2009).  Ari Applbaum  December 2009    I wrote my first business plan in high school. The two-page plan (perhaps an overstatement) was promptly filed and forgotten instead of pitched to investors. The concept of offering free internet access to attract an audience for highly targeted advertising was later \\"stolen\\" by California-based NetZero, a company once valued at three billion dollars. This type of Chutzpa, a teenager's audacity to think he could reinvent the way people connect to the Internet, is not uncommon in Israel.    But why? Why does Israel produce \\"more start-up companies than large, peaceful and stable nations like Japan, China, India, Korea, Canada and the United Kingdom?\\" Why is it that \\"after the United States, Israel has more companies listed on the NASDAQ than any other country in the world?\\" These are the questions Dan Senor and Saul Singer set out to answer in their short and intriguing book.    Senor and Singer begin by asserting that the answer \\"it's simple - Jews are smart, so it's no surprise that Israel is innovative\\" will not suffice as it \\"obscures more than it reveals\\". Instead they offer a thesis based on the Cluster Theory of Harvard Business School professor Michael Porter. Porter's clusters are \\"geographic concentrations of interconnected companies, specialized suppliers, service providers, and associated institutions in a particular field,(1)\\" in Israel's case, high-tech. The closeness and interconnectedness of such institutions help foster innovation and economic growth. The authors demonstrate throughout the book how Israel serves as a cluster, if not The Cluster, of high-tech. The three main players that form this cluster, in addition to the business sector, are the Israeli government, universities, and military.    The government encourages immigration and investment in research and development. The investment isboth ample (per capita, Israel spends more than any other country on civilian R&D) and smart. The authors cite for example a 16-year old, government-funding program which incentivized investors and effectively gave birth to the country's startup boom in the 1990s.    Israeli universities are world-class scientific research centers which create scientists who naturally find a home in the business sector. In 1959, with the creation of Yeda - the Weizmann Institute of Science's technology transfer company - Israeli academic institutions pioneered the practice of commercializing academic discoveries. This is a particular strength of Israeli universities today.    The unique element in the cluster might be the military. Senor and Singer explore the IDF's significant role in producing innovation. Elite intelligence and technology units train many of the next generation's entrepreneurs. Combat units empower Israelis to make split-second decisions and both assume awesome responsibilities and challenge -rather than blindly obey - their superiors. Compulsory military service is where future business relationships are made and reserve duty is where they are maintained. CEOs don't turn up their noses but seek out veterans and value their experience. The authors survey the birth of Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) as a case study highlighting the security industry's role as a growth engine for other industries, and how security technologies often migrate into the high-tech industry.    This cross-pollination between government, academia, military and the business sector greatly contributes to Israeli innovation. But the heart and soul of the cluster is Israeli society. The interconnectedness between these institutions works primarily because of Israel's small size and close-knit society. Israeli startup veteran Yossi Vardi's statement that \\"everybody knows everybody\\" in Israel is a cliché but not without some truth. But there's more to it than size.    \\"The greatest contribution of the Jewish people in history is dissatisfaction,\\" Shimon Peres tells the authors. \\"That's poor for politics but good for science.\\" Peres notes that when a new shipment of the latest technologies arrives from the U.S, within five minutes Israelis are taking it apart and trying to improve. This is true throughout Israeli society. Israelis are constantly inventing and reinventing, thinking and rethinking, trying to improve themselves and everything around them. Additionally, Israelis are not afraid to fail, and most possess the right balance of personal ambition and an individualistic drive with a spirit of collaboration and sense of community. These are all critical success factors for a healthy startup culture.    Try as they may to steer clear from the \\"Jews are smart\\" theory, Senor and Singer end up recognizing that the unique conditions of Israel as a Jewish State and Israelis' unique sense of purpose that results are the core of Israel's success as a startup nation. The personal and professional journeys of Israelis Shai Agassi and David Frohman are prime examples. Had Shai Agassi stayed in California, he would have likely been appointed the next CEO of SAP, one of the most lucrative and sought-after jobs in Information Technology. But Agassi, whose story is told in great detail in the book's introduction, decided to help free Israel and the world from oil dependency. An ardent Zionist, he launched Project Better Place, the most ambitious electric vehicle project in history, and chose Israel for his pilot site.    David Frohman helped build Intel from the ground up in California. The obvious career choice for him was to stay put and benefit from Intel's growth and success, yet Frohman returned in 1974 to the Jewish State to realize the then improbable vision of turning Israel into a world leader in chip design. During the 1991 Gulf War, with missiles falling on Israeli population centers, Intel instructed Frohman to \\"do whatever you must do.\\" Why did Frohman keep Intel's plants open? And why would Intel employees choose to continue showing up to work, as the authors note, \\"the more brazen the attacks, the larger the turnout?\\" Senor and Singer answer in a single word - davka, a unique Hebrew word loosely translated as to spite'. Israelis possess a sense of purpose that drives them to thrive davka in the face of security threats and adversity.    After 242 pages of an easy and enjoyable read, one realizes that the answer to the authors' question was hiding in the book's title all along. Israel does not just produce startups, it is a startup. Israel is a young, entrepreneurially spirited, small yet fast-growing, fast-paced, nimble, impatient, risk-taking, anti-hierarchical, creative and - perhaps most importantly - successful startup. If Zionism was a daring two-page business plan (with Herzl as a starry-eyed entrepreneur knocking relentlessly on doors of European venture capitalists), then Israel is its equally unimaginable successful outcome. Today, \\"The new pioneering Zionist narrative is about creating things,\\" entrepreneur Erel Margalit tells the authors. Startups are not grown in a vacuum; they need the right breeding grounds, an incubator, if you will. And what better country to serve as a startup incubator than a country that is a startup? Therein lies the author's main revelation.    Senor, a former Deputy White House Press Secretary, and Singer, a Jerusalem Post writer, and are first and foremost excellent storytellers. What makes the book a must-read are the dozens of anecdotes and case studies. The authors' two comprehensive rolodexes translate into more than 100 top-quality interviews. They spoke with senior Israeli officials such as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres, met with chief executives at Google, Cisco and Intel, and interviewed military experts, Jewish historians, and some of the key figures in Israel's venture capital and high-tech scene, including Erel Margalit, Chemi Peres, Yossi Vardi, Jon Medved and many others. The outcome is fascinating. The authors' access to industry experts also brings to light lesser known tales, such as the account of a power struggle between Intel Haifa and Intel Santa Clara, which may be the highlight of the book. Senor and Singer unveil a 2003 drama, little known outside the semiconductor industry, in which Intel Haifa managed to save the company and perhaps the entire industry from an almost certain downfall by thinking out of the box and using Israeli chutzpa to relentlessly force senior executives into a paradigm shift.    It is not clear who the target audience is for this book. First and foremost, the authors hope it will become the ultimate playbook for CEOs, a compilation of lessons American executives can learn from Israelis about innovation. Senor and Singer quote HBS Professor Jon Kao, who says that the United States is \\"rapidly becoming the fat, complacent, Detroit of nations.\\" The authors repeatedly state that America has much to learn from Israeli innovation but struggle to find exportable lessons and end up focusing mostly on what is unique to Israel. Consequently, their recommendations seem forced and not completely hashed out. They derive from the Israeli experience, for example, that mandatory service - either in the military or in some sort of national service - could help foster innovation. But what would this system look like? How would this affect the deeply-rooted capitalist ethos of American society? These questions remain unanswered. Perhaps the book is meant for business students. It is certainly not academic, but Senor's HBS background and investing involvement are apparent through the use of business jargon and academic theories. It is not implausible that a chapter would be used by professors in the field of business innovation, but more than that is unlikely. Most seriously, the authors touch upon but do not offer an adequate explanation of how to take startups to the nextlevel and create larger, viable corporations that thrive over time. Israel may have the same problems.    The book clearly tries to appeal to Zionist audiences. The Jewish authors are unabashedly Zionist and are clearly ideologically motivated. Singer dedicates the book to his brother, an officer in the IDF who was killed in Lebanon. Senor dedicates the book to his father who helped start the Weizmann Institute's pioneering solar energy research program. While the authors need not completely distance themselves from the subject matter in such a book, at times it reads like a Ministry of Foreign Affairs or an \\"Invest in Israel Hasbarah\\" (Israel advocacy) book. Their juxtaposition of Israel with Gulf States is helpful in highlighting why growth without civil liberties, creativity, and an engaged population cannot build a cluster of high-tech innovation. But the authors seemed to have too much fun with the analogy, as if to say \\"look what Israel can do and its Arab neighbors cannot.\\" As a Hasbarah piece, it is indeed the long-lost, mature, sophisticated and beefy cousin of the Israel21Cs and \\"Israel invented the Cell Phone\\" burgeoning positive messaging resources, but that's the problem: by definition it isn't a Hasbarah project.    The average business student might enjoy the book as light reading, but it is not likely to be assigned as an academic textbook. CEOs might read it to learn lessons from the stories told, but it falls short of becoming \\"a playbook for every CEO.\\" There is too much technological jargon for non-techies and at the same time it is probably too journalistic for industry insiders. And for those interested in innovation outside the Jewish/pro-Israel community, the book's Zionist focus might be too hard hitting.    It is impossible to understand Israel as a startup nation without examining the many components that make it so. While there is something for everyone in the book - academic, businessperson, Zionist, technologist and story lover, it is the possibly rare reader who combines all of the above who would take greatest pleasure in the book. That may imply a narrow readership - although I can think of at least one now-post high school business plan writing Israel advocate who thinks it's a must read. There may also be seven million other potential readers, Israeli entrepreneurs who fuse many interests to form an entrepreneurial spirit. But if the authors are right in asserting that all those interested in innovation could stand to benefit from following Israel's entrepreneurial model, this book may be a good place to start.    i Harvard Business School - Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness Web Site - [...].
B00008BXJG|5.0|This album should get 20 stars , one of the best hard rock albums ever made. Every track is a winner. Sure this album was a bit more radio friendly than all that came before it but it`s still the same balls to wall stomping AC/DC with clearer background vocals and much better production thanks to Mutt Lange. Back In Black was an incredible album due to what the band had to endure to make it but Highway To Hell is AC/DC finest moment.
B002VECM4K|5.0|So much praise has been lavished on this film, all of it justly deserved. From the opening scene until the ending, the movie holds you in its relentless grip. You will not see another film like this one this year or any other year for that matter.<br /><br />First the actors-- to a person they are superb and totally convincing from Gabourey Sidibe as Precious to her mother Mary (Mo'Nique)to Mariah Carey as Precious' social worker Ms. Weiss to Paula Patton as Ms. Rain, her instructor at the alternative school. Someone or two will get awards for these performances. The young girls in the alternative school-- Precious has no idea what an anternative school is when her perceptive male teacher sees the good in her and sends her to one-- in their smaller roles are perfectly cast as well.<br /><br />So many things could have gone wrong about this film, but it works on every level. The subject matter, the statements it makes, its ultimate truths hit you in your face: poverty, incest, teenage pregnancy, welfare abuse, child abuse but also survival and hope and the belief that education can help pull a lost soul out of the depths of despair and degradation.<br /><br />I have been unable to get this film out of mind days after seeing it, a sure sign that I have witnessed a simply fantastic work of art.
0307408833|1.0|I received this dessert cookbook for my recent birthday and thought that the recipes sounded delicious. I do not have celiac disease, but cooking gluten free and just having more vegan dessert recipes was welcome. Several months passed and finally my wife and I decided to try one of the recipes and the red velvet cupcakes caught our eye, along with the vanilla frosting. After buying everything we needed, much of which was expensive, we proceeded to make the frosting and cupcakes. Tasting is believing, and now I believe this may possibly be the worst cupcakes I have ever had. The cake was dry and did not have an appealing taste. The frosting did not become creamy and had an unappealing texture. The remaining cupcakes and frosting went into the compost bin; we wasted our time and money.     Doing a little exploring and searching, my wife discovered that other people also did not enjoy this cookbook and that the recipes did not match what is actually made at the bakery. This is shameful and a pity. We are not going to try any of the other recipes in the cookbook.    We have never had a problem making the awesome cupcakes from Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, which I recommend completely. Some of the recipes need a little adjusting depending on your tastes, but the cupcakes have all been amazing and the ingredients are simple and much cheaper.

B00000J2SP|5.0|This album is rock and roll it's just not a harder edge type of hard rock. It's more rock with some heavy pop overtones.  And on that level it excels. A band can make different types of rock and roll and do it well.  So if you take this on that level and say: \\"is this great rock and roll of it's type? hard rock with a pop edge?\\" then yes! and I don't find fault with it all.  I do like the earlier rainbow albums alot and they are really well done but they are  a different type of hard rock generally.  This disc had hit singles and they were all good rock and pop rock songs. The best of them is: \\"It can't happen here\\"  which is in many ways a classic rock song that was a hit by any standard. The song could be the soundtrack for every disaster movie and real disaster facing mankind since the seventies. because 'were using up the future!\\" as it points out. Plus we still face possible nuclear war due to rogue states such as Iran although at the time of this ablum we faced the Soviet communist empire and total destruction.  This song could fit well on any rainbow cd as far as I am concerned.  I like every song on this disc as well; even the poppier ones. And The lead singer can really sing which is another benefit that some of todays hard rock just lacks sadly.  So if you like survivor , night ranger and other bands then you will like this one.  And although the earlier rainbow stuff is different it's well worth a good listen too as well.

078322737X|5.0|The year was 1962. The British Invasion, Rock and Roll and the horrors of Vietnam were just over the horizon. John Kennedy was still president. 1962 was the lull before the storm. American Graffiti brilliantly portrays that brief moment of innocence in American history.<br />This film kicked off George Lucas's directing career. Every viewing of the film is a revelation. I have seen it many times and have always thought of it as having been filmed in Modesto, Lucas's hometown, but as The Making of American Graffiti, the superb documentary included with this DVD reveals, it was actually filmed in Petaluma. Many acting careers began with this movie, including those of Richard Dreyfuss, Ronny Howard and  Harrison Ford. American Graffiti set a precedent for wall to wall music in films, which was copied by many that followed. All the music was selected by Lucas. Be sure to get the soundtrack album, which is on two CDs.<br />This American classic is worth another viewing, but don't miss The Making of American Graffiti, which is the model for how bonus features should be made. It features interviews of the filmmakers and actors in the film and reveals Lucas's unorthodox casting and directing style. Many takes were filmed and Lucas often kept those where mistakes occurred.

Otherwise I thought it was very creative...you never knew what was going to happen next!
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|The marketing portrays UP as a lighthearted comedy adventure. It isn't. While there are certainly funny moments, on the whole it's the most depressing movie I've seen in years, and the contrast between the expectation and the reality is shocking. I love dark movies, but the way UP is presented borders on deceptive. I almost wonder if this film was intended as a psychological experiment.    I saw UP in the theater. Seated in the row in front of me was a family of ogres who'd spent the day stomping an orphanage flat. They'd brought a box of kittens to snack on during the movie. Within 10 minutes of  the start of the film every one of them was bawling uncontrollably. I'm a stone-cold heartless monster myself, and *never* cry in movies... until UP. Hey Pixar, here's a tip: tears ruin the 3D effect.    Presumably the intention was use the death of the old man's wife as a starting point for an ultimately uplifting (no pun intended) story. Unfortunately, it casts such a dark shadow on the rest of the movie that the funny bits don't even begin to make up for it. Dug the dog is the brightest aspect of the movie and a hilarious character, but doesn't balance out the cascade of tragedies great and small that befall the old man. Seeing the old man tied to his house like a pack animal and being forced to drag it through the jungle is one of the *lighter* moments. WTH? The happy ending really rings hollow, and isn't worth the journey it takes to get there.    I considered not mentioning this next point, but I'm going to go ahead and do so anyway. My mother-in-law died a few months before UP came out, and my father-in-law was, as one would expect, devastated. My wife and I both separately came to the conclusion that if he'd seen the movie he absolutely would have gone home and eaten his shotgun afterward. I know that I used hyperbole earlier in this review, but on this point I'm being completely serious and not exaggerating.    From a technical standpoint, UP is superb. The animation, character design, vocal performances, etc. are all top notch, just as you would expect from Pixar. However, I would only recommend it to emotional cripples, psychopaths, and people who have never experienced the loss of a loved one.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|The XX have crafted a brilliant album and a refreshing new take on music.  This is definately not a \\"mainstream\\" type album, and its all the more enjoyable because of it. There are dark overtones projected here, with midnight phone call relationship vocals on top. Like a mash up of Tricky, early Cure, New Order/Monaco, Interpol, and some Sade sprinkled in. Great chill music for late at night like most of the reviews have said, but I found it to be compliant for trips to and from work as well. I was pleasantly surprised to find all the songs are repeat worthy except for Fantasy.  (Fantasy is the only dud on the record in my opinion.)  The Intro song is awesome, just wish it was longer!  Other than that I thought Infinity, Nighttime, and Shelter were the best tracks on the album (if I had to pick the top 3).  Definately worth getting if you want to unwind and help support original young artists.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite Christmas movies.  Tim Burton did a bang-up job with this one.  As a fan of Tim's, I must say that I fell in love with this one almost immediately.  While some may not appreciate the mixing of Halloween and Christmas, I think that the moral of this story is great.  Using comedy and stop-motion animation, Tim illustrates that people need to be themselves.    The animation is great and the songs are well-written and sung.  I find myself singing bits and pieces of the various songs throughout the year!  To say that it annoys those around me would be an understatement!    My only gripe is that the Digital copy will only work with iPods or devices certified for the Microsoft PlaysForSure program (meaning that my Microsoft Zune is incompatible).    I highly recommend this one!
B001VLXNLU|4.0|When I first started reading this I wasn't thrilled and thought it was dumb.  I put it down for quite awhile and decided to pick it up a few months later.  After reading for awhile I couldn't put it down and read the series in a week.  I became a HUGE Zoey fan and can't wait to see what she becomes.
0805091742|5.0|I am not in the medical field, but I found this book relevant to many fields. It describes how complicated things can be managed more effectively through an approach that combines intelligent adherence to protocol with mandatory communications among team members.  I also liked learning about how checklists are created and tested:  it's not easy to create a checklist that works consistently under high-stress conditions.  Dr Gawande's description of how checklists are tested, refined, then tested again in diverse field conditions makes one realize how important it is to identify the absolutely critical checkpoints and then gather lots of input from different team members.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I loved this film, I did not see this at the theater, but I wish I had. Every actor played their role prefect. I f you want a good laugh Sandra Bullock and Betty White make this hilarious.    I highly recommend this movie.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Everyone in the world should see these videos.  BBC does the best.  All schoolchildren should be shown these so they can be a part of changing our world, THEIR world.  Videos were perfect, which has not always been our experience in ordering videos.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Wow!!! Tv shows are often hesitant to do a movie version of the show, just as they were with this one, but I don't think it could've done any better!!    I loved the series and was also sad to see it go.     As a fan of the show, and a woman in general, I loved loved LOVED this movie, and cried about 17 times! But in all fairness, the movie showed a few break-ups, a few reconciliations, a wedding, a surprise miracle pregnancy, new year's, valentine's day AND a BEAUTIFUL walk in closet!!!! Many reasons to tear up, mostly with joy however!    A really feel-good movie overall, even though there are sad moments too.
0060920084|2.0|I was a big fan of Bryson's book, A Walk In the Woods, which detailed his (somewhat truncated) journey along the Appalachian Trail. So it was with a sense of optimism that I opened his much older tome, The Lost Continent, seeking some insight as to life journeying through small-town America.    That is how the book bills itself, but it's very misleading. I've identified several problems:    (1) The book really does not discover small-town America or describe it at all. I found myself hopeful at several points when Bryson encountered odd small-towns in far-flung locales, but he never gives this anything but superficial treatment. This would have been much better if the focus of the book was Bryson's awkward interactions - say, at a little league game, or at a church fundraiser - with locals. I can't recall a single instance of that, except for his half-misogynistic descriptions of coffee-shop waitresses and the cheap banter between the two. In short, I didn't learn much about small-town America at all.    (2) As to point (1), the book really focuses on a lot of big cities or obvious tourist attractions (e.g., downtown Philadelphia, Mt. Rushmore????) with superficial descriptions that could have been lifted from an encyclopedia. This was not what I expected or paid for.    (3) Bryson traveled...alone. Is it me or is this just plain weird? In A Walk In the Woods, Bryson's interaction with his hiking companion made the book. Here, Bryson comes across as a fat, angry, loner recluse who talks to no one in the 38 states he visited. Sorry. The weirdness factor irked me.    (4) I'm not sure there was a point to the book. Like I mentioned earlier, if this was a book about trying to find the perfect small-town in America (and eventually, say, finding it), then the book would be compelling and interesting. As it stands, the book is little more than a sarcastic version of a Mobil Travel Guide from the late 1980s.    The only reason I give this two stars is that Bryson is funny.He delivers a few one-liners and zingers that are ones I'll remember. Many people, though, will find his humor arrogant. However, even this is not enough to make up for a book that is little more than one man's random (and increasingly angry) dictations along America's highways.
0395492815|3.0|A little pricey but it was a christmas rush item.  Would have been nice if book came with it.
031606792X|1.0|It's laughable, but days after I finished Breaking Dawn, I'm here on Amazon looking at other reviews so I can cope with this terrible ending to my beloved Twilight.  I adored the first three books, flaws and all, but this last book just turns my stomach, and I'm relieved to find I'm not alone.    I won't recap what's already been said far more eloquently, but I had to let my voice be counted among the others that felt disgusted by the creepshow birth, puzzled by the breezy vampire transformation, and depressed by Jacob's imprinting.  But the fatal flaw has to be the lack of romance between Edward and Bella.  The three books before this are packed with gooey pledges of adoration and burning kisses that make your stomach flip over itself. The romance in this book drops off a cliff the moment Bella becomes pregnant.  Bella and Edward's all-consuming love is the series' motor, without it, the whole thing sputters out and then careens into a ditch.    For me Twilight series now ends with Eclipse, when Bella and Edward have to heroically sacrifice things they care about in order to be together, but that's the point---they have each other, and that's worth any price.
1563899426|4.0|I must admit I didn't get into this novel as thoroughly as I had expected. The back story is interesting and the concept is novel, but the dialogue and characters seemed, at times, too expected. All personal bias, I freely admit.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|While watching tv one day last October, nothing was on so I decided to check out ON Demand on Comcast.  I decided on FX as I had been pleased by another nice surprise, Damages, starring Glen Close.  Sons of Anarchy, starred Katey Segal, a favorite actress of mine going back to Married with Children and Futurama.  FX was running the second season.  I saw enough of the second season to make me very curious about what transpired during the first season, so I ordered the DVD.  WOW! The Sons are the Sopranos in leather and on bikes.  Two things caught my attention and made this series enjoyable [after all it is tv - please God]: Katey Segal's deep and disturbing role, Jima, as the matriarch of the clan and the character Jaks who while professing his love for the botherhood is all the while searching for a deeper meaning and a better path for Sam Crowe.    Great writing and acting!  Come on Season 3!
0446364495|5.0|Love this book.  Have read it many times and watched the movie over and over again.  You CAN fall forever in love in a short amount of time!  I would have loved for Francesca to leave with Robert!  The first time I read the book I cried until I had the snubs reading it!  Then I read it aloud to my husband.  He loved it as well. Here we are 15 yrs later still loving it!  The scene of Robert standing in the rain in the middle of the road was heart breaking!
B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9 was one of several big 'sleeper' hits in 2009. Made on a relatively modest budget of $30 million, it made more than six times its money back at the box office (a success that even the mighty Avatar has not yet quite replicated), despite featuring no star names and being made and set in South Africa with a large amount of subtitles. The movie's origins are also unusual. Director Neill Blomkamp had previously been hired by producer Peter Jackson to work on the Halo move adaptation after producing several imaginative short adverts for the Halo 3 promotional treadmill. Blomkamp and Jackson's work on the film was at a fairly advanced stage when the movie was put on hold due to concerns over its immense budget. Having enjoyed collaborating together, Jackson and Blomkamp decided to fill in the spare time with a new project, a (relatively) low-budget expansion of Blomkamp's earlier short film Alive in Joburg. Given the film's immense number of high-quality effects shots and the heavily action-driven last act, it is even more impressive that the movie was made for such a small amount of money (only a little more than 10% of the budget of Avatar, for example).    District 9 is a curious beast. Much of its opening half is filmed from the POV of various camera crews, news footage, documentaries and so on, introducing the aliens, their spaceship, MNU and Wikus himself. After the incident in the slums when Wikus is infected this approach is scaled back in favour of following the action in a more traditional manner. This transition is a little awkward (with Wikus asking someone to shut off a camera after a good 15-20 minutes of the story being completely told using the documentary approach and then the action continues to unfold) but aside from that this mix of approaches does work quite well. With Sharlto Copley as Wikus being on screen for pretty much the entire movie, his performance is key to making the movie work, and fortunately he is an excellent actor. He improvised most of his dialogue to keep the film feeling authentic and real despite its SF premise, and he is aided by some great prosthetic and make-up work. Jason Cope takes on the role of 'Christopher', an alien plotting to escape Earth who becomes Wikus' only ally as the story proceeds, and like Andy Serkis in The Lord of the Rings trilogy performed his role in-camera only to be replaced by CGI later on. Cope does a fantastic job, giving Christopher (clearly some kind of technician or higher-caste creature than the other, rather unintelligent aliens) real character and presence.    Broadly, District 9 is a successful and 'different' SF movie, with a clear parallel being drawn between the treatment of the aliens by humans (black and white alike) and the treatment of the black population of South Africa during apartheid. The movie's title and premise are based on the 'District Six' situation of the 1970s, when an area of Johannesburg was declared 'whites only' and the black population was forcibly moved to another location. The South African setting gives rise to a very different SF movie to what you may have expected in an American or European film. Violence is commonplace, the killing of aliens by MNU personnel or humans by the aliens is largely unremarked on (shrugged off as one of the dangers of the job) and corruption of the MNU and the law enforcement company they have hired is endemic. This bleakness is present throughout the film, and although occasionally wearying, does make the film feel authentic. The fact that the aliens have been around for twenty years and no-one is really shocked by them any more also gives the film an interesting air of realism in spite of is highly fantastical premise.    The CGI is excellent throughout. Not quite as breathtaking as Avatar, obviously, but the constant integration of the CG aliens with real human actors in real locations is clearly challenging and they pull it off pretty much flawlessly. It's so good, in fact, that you forget that these creatures, weapons and in a couple of cases weapons are not actually there at all, which is of course the point of good visual effects, supporting the story without diverting attention away from it.    One flaw I've seen noted by critics is that the movie's intelligent side, notably the exploration of the apartheid-like relationship between the aliens and humans and possible further exploration of the aliens' backstory, is largely abandoned in the third act in favour of an extended running action sequence. I didn't have a huge problem with this, as Blomkamp was clearly uninterested in making a vast epic and wanted to get in, say some interesting things, deliver an entertaining picture, and then get out again, which is fairly laudable in an age of needlessly swollen running times. Whilst there's some logic problems in the final act (the alien mecha suit that plays a large role in the climax seems to go from being invulnerable, heavily-armoured and sporting powerful weapons to being fairly fragile and unable to take down a small number of opponents in the space of a couple of scenes) it's also fairly compelling, with some great moments building up to a somewhat ambiguous ending. The movie is left open-ended for a possible sequel or follow-up, but the movie as it stands has enough closure to be satisfying.    District 9 (****½) is a short, sharp and clever motion picture combining great visuals and some interesting thematic elements with excellent performances. The film is available now on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).
B002M9WW30|1.0|With all the whining about preorder pricing in the reviews, there isn't enough attention being paid to the fact that this is one of the worst blu ray transfers to date. Obviously Rocky isn't going to fare well compared to UP! or Transformers, but it looks bad compared to the blu ray versions of most older movies as well. In general, even if an older movie isn't going to blow you away, it can at least pull off a crisp, clean picture that looks noticeably better than an upscaled DVD. This is where the Rocky Blu Ray collection fails miserably.    In the early movies, probably 3/4 of the scenes are incredibly soft and look no better than an upscaled DVD. The other 1/4 of the scenes are up to the mediocre standard of the typical older movie and do look better than DVD. If the entire films were up to that mediocre standard I could give a good review, but sadly they aren't. My complaints aren't even about things like film grain, which is a perfectly acceptable stylistic choice. There's just a tremendous lack of detail and definition, and uneven picture quality throughout. One dark scene will look acceptable, then the next will be incredibly washed out with regions that are supposed to be black showing up as light gray. In Rocky 2 there are even odd white dot artifacts that are incredibly distracting and weren't in the DVD if I remember correctly.     The later films do look better...Rocky Balboa is obviously fine since it was an independent blu ray release. But most of the Rocky movies that are available exclusively in this set look absolutely atrocious. If you already have the DVD set, stick with that and just buy Rocky Balboa on Blu Ray.    fyi: I have a highly calibrated Pioneer Elite plasma and 120 blu rays. The only other ones I have that look close to this bad are Robocop and The Fugitive.
B00007GZR5|1.0|I read the book when it first came out and have re-read it thru the years, as it's one of my all time favorites.  I always thought it would make a wonderful movie and waited for years until this one finally came out in the late 90s....I was so excited when I heard that it was finally going to be made into a movie...until I saw the movie.  I don't believe I have ever been more disappointed in my life in a book-to-movie movie.      They took way too many liberties with regards to changes in the movie that it almost made it seem like a totally different story.  By killing off the children (which did not happen in the book) it made it seem like the grief Ann would have felt at losing Chris would not have been life shattering enough.  THEN they killed him off.  The point of the whole story was the closness between Chris and Ann...THEIR bond...which was stronger than anything else in their lives.  That was the point of the story.  And while I love Robin Williams, I felt that his portrayal of Chris bordered on silliness.  Hollywood even had to change Chris' profession...I guess him being a writer wasn't acceptable enough.....they made him a doctor.    To say I was highly disappointed in the movie is an understatement.  I don't blame Richard Matheson for being disappointed as well..... \\" I was disappointed in it, because it changed a good deal of my story, and I thought by their desire to have the two children die before him - they did that because they felt that if she committed suicide and left children behind, the audience would not like her, which, you know, may or may not be true - but it made for terrible complications, I thought, especially when they decided not even to identify them in the afterlife but to have them disguised as various other people.\\" Richard Matheson - quote.    Well, said Richard.  I guess Hollywood felt that they knew more about your book than you did.  Evidently not because the movie, in my opinion, was AWFUL!!!!! I do give credit to special effects, though......without them, the movie was a disaster.    FORGET THE MOVIE..........READ THE BOOK!!!!
0802798225|5.0|After being forced into being Chemistry partners Alex, the tough Mexican gang member who intimdates and frightens everyone at Fairfield Highschool, and Britney the golden girl who everyone wants to be find they have more in common than either of them wants to admit.  After spending time together working on their chemistry project they find they are beginning to have feelings for eachother.  These feelings grown into intense love which is placed at risk when Alex is forced into a drug deal for his gang.      I absolutely loved Perfect Chemistry. It is written in first person with both Alex and Britney taking turns with the narrative.  The author pulled this off flawlessly.  You grow to love the characters, they actually come alive and you care what happens to them.  The story itself is amazing, a realistic plot that is put together with a creative touch.      I recommend this book to everyone who is a romance reader, young adult or not this book will entertain.  I have read it more times than I can count and recommended it to all of my romance loving friends.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Hans Zimmer explodes into adventure with his highly entertaining and very unique score to Sherlock Holmes. When I first read that Hans would be doing a Guy Ritchie film I became a little curious. Ritchie is known for using mostly songs and little to no score in his films. So, why would he hire a composer who is known for making music stand up and take charge in the narrative? I don't know why, but I'm glad it happened. The score is incredibly fun and is a concoction that only Zimmer and his featured soloists could have come up with.<br /><br />Hans says the score took inspiration from Irish and gypsy music. So the tunes are off key in places and utilize uncommon instruments such as the banjo or the custom hybrid \\"Experibass\\". It has the swashbuckling waltzy feel of his theme for Jack Sparrow yet all the instrumentation and attitude of an Ennio Morricone western score. In other words, it brings what you see on the screen to vivid life. The track \\"Not In Blood, But In Bond\\" showcases one of the many amazing soloists in a hauntingly beautiful track. This track plays over the slow motion sequence of the wharf bombing and will honestly give you chills. Yet you will have a ridiculously goofy track like \\" I Never Woke Up In Handcuff's Before\\", which has a Middle Eastern flair accented by an accordion that eventually weaves the main theme in.<br /><br />The film itself is hugely entertaining and there is not a dull moment in the entire score (or the film). The highlight is of course the 18-minute track titled \\"Psychological Recovery . . . 6 Months\\". It's practically all the music from the final act of the film and it's one helluva ride. The structures and sounds bleed Zimmer and will keep you riveted and smiling all at once. Hans is still the only composer I know who knows best how to create these grand emotional ascending arcs that continually build and build and then erupt, which is exactly what the final act of the score does.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes was a great way to end the year. It was like getting a summer action score in the winter when usually all we have is the \\"serious\\" stuff. Hans Zimmer continues to go out of his way to try and not tread over old ground. He continually creates emotionally driven music that lifts the films he scores to new heights. I still love the fact that he can do all this crazy and innovative instrumentation and the sound is still unmistakably Zimmer. I also love the \\"Black Hawk Down\\" strings that come in at 10:35 into \\"Psychological Recovery . . . 6 Months\\". If there are any Modern Warfare 2 players out there they might recognize it. I don't know if Hans or Lorne is responsible for that one, but it made me smile.s like getting a summer action score in the winter when usually all we have is the \\"serious\\" stuff.

B002PLALCO|2.0|Everything was great with ordering the DVD (Amazon was even the only place that we could find it).    While watching, towards the end the DVD skipped over several chapters and no matter what we tried we could not get to those chapters.  We had ordered one for us and one for a friend so we tried the second one with the same result.    We have not received replacements yet, but so far Amazon has been very responsive in handling the return.    Will update when issue is finally resolved.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|First off, Steve Vai is easily in the upper echelon of guitar players   whom I truly admire!  He, the late great Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic, and   Jimi Hendrix are the ones who made me first pick up a guitar and say   \\"Hell Yeah!--I wanna do that!\\" (-:   This amazing 2007 concert, done in Minneapolis is simply brilliant!  Steve's virtuosity as well as his diversity and fluid dexerity   are the stuff of legend!  This man is a true genius in my eyes, and this 2 disc DVD showcases   that fact perfectly!    The better question would be what couldn't Steve Vai play?   He's seen them come and go, he's played behind everybody from   Frank Zappa to David Lee Roth and more and hasn't lost any of his   inventiveness and fire along the way!  From experimental electric forays to brilliant acoustic pieces...  all of them will have you rewinding it again and again and asking yourself  \\"How Did He Do That?\\" or \\"Did He Just Do That?\\"  If you've never had the opportunity to see him live...  this is the next best thing!  Master Steve Vai, I forever bow at your axe altar!! (-:  Guitar players, (or good music lovers) you gotta get this one here!  If I could only recommend 2 Guitar Player DVD's for 2010, it would be  \\"It Might Get Loud\\" featuring Jimmy Paige, The Edge and Jack White   and this amazing concert DVD here for sure!  (-:  Enjoy!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Unless you have been living in a cave, you're probably already well aware of the remarkable fairy tale story of Susan Boyle - of the frumpy-looking Scottish woman who wowed the crowds (and Simon) with her impeccable and soul-stirring rendition of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\"    At the center of this fairy tale is Susan's beautiful voice - which is showcased in this excellent CD.  I've listened to it 2-3 times already, and I have been moved each time I've heard it.  Not only does Susan have a crystalline voice but her diction is impeccable, her intonation and inflection flawless, and her ability to emote superb.    Susan especially shines on songs such as \\"Wild Horses,\\" \\"I Was Born To Be,\\" \\"Amazing Grace,\\" and her signature tune, \\"I Dreamed a Dream.\\"  What I really appreciated was the diverse mix of musical styles, including the Martin Luther King Jr. tribute, \\"Up To The Mountain.\\"  Even though she is slightly out of her element with \\"Daydream Believer\\" and \\"End of the World,\\" she still does an excellent rendering of both covers.    The linear notes in the CD are also very good, with Susan giving a brief explanation after each song why she chose it and why it had particular meaning to her.    The only disappointing part of the whole album was her take on \\"How Great Thou Art.\\"  Even though she does a beautiful job on the chorus (which she repeats 3 times), I would have loved to hear her sing the verses as well!    Otherwise, like the Ugly Duckling who became the beautiful swan, and like Cinderella at the ball, Susan's \\"Happily Ever After\\" is culminated in this CD, and one I would highly recommend.
B000068FXR|4.0|I like Crisis? What Crisis? the best of all Supertramp albums.  It has proven to be the dark horse of their catalog (not counting their first 2 pre-classic period releases), probably because of the lack of overt hooks and the presence of only one hit song, \\"Ain't Nobody But Me.\\"  But partially for these reasons, the album becomes more rewarding and reveals greater depth with repeated plays.      Kicking off with the early-morning, sleepy sounding \\"Easy Does it\\" nicely seguing into the beautiful sitar intro of \\"Sister Moonshine\\", the album's second deserving hit, Crisis immediately delivers its knockout punch.  \\"A Soapbox Opera\\" continues Hodgson's penchant for character based songs (much like \\"Rudy\\" from Crime)while contrasting is Davies' upbeat and funky \\"Another Man's Woman.\\"  Both are stronger entries in the early Supertramp catalog, full of personality and instrumental complexity.     Side two is not as solid; \\"Lady\\" is a fun Hodgson ditty complete with the group's trademark keyboard sound introduced in Crime (see \\"Dreamer\\") and running throughout their popular era.  \\"Poor Boy\\" is cabaretish in it's use of horns and Brighton Beach whimsy.  Here and on \\"Just A Normal Day,\\" Davies and Hodgson trade vocal chores, something that would become sadly obsolete on upcoming albums.      Unfortunately, Crisis closes on one of it's weaker moments, \\"Two of Us,\\" with Hodgson straining both his chords and sentimentality.  It comes across a bit too syrupy, somewhat akin to the atmosphere achieved in the hit \\"It's Raining Again\\" from years later.  But overall, Crisis triumphs in it's ambition and wide musical range, even if not overly appreciated among their other 70's releases.  Roger cites this as his favorite Tramp album.
0451450523|4.0|The Last Unicorn is a 1968 fantasy novel by Peter S. Beagle. The eponymous unicorn sets out with several human companions to find the rest of her kind and to confront numerous obstacles, including the monstrous Red Bull.<br /><br />Beagle writes beautifully and charmingly, almost poetically, and The Last Unicorn is worth reading for that reason alone. The novel is humorously anachronistic in places, and it's sprinkled profusely with little literary delights: a turn of phrase here, a choice of word there. It's delightful just to read Beagle's sentences.<br /><br />But the story itself is less than compelling, which can make the novel too easy to put down. While The Last Unicorn is filled with emotion and imagination and post-modernistic self-discovery, the events that transpire aren't particularly remarkable. They're the kinds of things that fantasy storytellers make up as they go along. It does seem that Beagle is more interested in raising what he obviously feels are important questions about existence and self than with engaging the reader on the basis of plot. And there's nothing wrong with that, but it's not the kind of thing a lot people like to read, nor is it something that many readers often come to fantasy fiction for.<br /><br />The Last Unicorn is not for everyone. People who think of it as Beagle himself does are likely to find it profound; others may find it shallow. But anyone who appreciates excellent writing will find it well worth his or her time.
0385736002|3.0|THE ALCHEMYST is the first book in the \\"Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel\\" series. The book introduces the story of a pair of fraternal twins (Sophie and Josh) who find themselves thrust into an epic and perilous struggle for ownership of a magic book of world-changing secrets, recipes, and prophecies. Nicholas Flamel, an alchemist (yes, I'm using the modern \\"American\\" spelling of the term), has lived for several centuries, protecting the book and using its recipe for the elixir of life to live forever. Now, Dr. John Dee seeks to usurp the book and its secrets for darker purposes.     The main plotline is fast-paced and fairly direct. Occasionally, with fantasy literature you come across books with complex, multi-threaded plots with so many characters, places, and events that the story becomes cumbersome and difficult to follow. In THE ALCHEMYST, Scott keeps the story uncomplicated, and even when the book darts between multiple locations and character perspectives, these diverging threads are still strongly linked to the central plot involving this \\"Book of the Mage.\\"     The author employs a writing style that is easy-to-read, but also contains flashes of sophistication in word choice and imagery. It's a style that actually seems to parallel the juxtoposition of modern and magic in the story. One of my only complaints is that some of the \\"flashback\\" passages, where the author describes a character's history to provide insight into his/her thoughts or emotions, seem to be inserted rather clumsily into the story. Many of these nods to a character's past are just interjected abruptly in the middle of the main story's progression. I would have liked to see more thought and organization put into their presentation.    My other real beef with the book is that the ending is too much of a cliffhanger. There is very little closure for the reader, and I don't really think the book can stand alone as its own story. With all of the loose ends left after reading the finalpage, it's basically mandatory that you read the next book to see what happens next. I suspect this is a theme that continues until the final book.    History buffs will either love or hate the many references to historical figures, ancient mythology, and legends. The author puts his own twist on all of the references he incorporates into his book. Even main characters, such as Nicholas Flamel and Dr. John Dee, were real people in history. I personally thought that the references were fun, if a bit hokey at times. I will say that the author's knowledge of all of these people, philosophies, customs, and locations mentioned in his book is rather impressive.     Overall, I found the book compelling with lots of fun twists on historical references, but some of the clumsy execution and lack of resolution at the end of the book holds me back from giving it a higher score.
B000A2WF3S|5.0|Now here is a disc for classical aficionados to thrill over.  Latvian virtuosso Gidon Kremer's lifetime study and performance of Bach's eternal compositions comes to fruition in this dynamic, unique and breathtaking recording.  As others note, it is different but different in a good way.  I found myself immediately drawn into these sometimes thorny works to novice ears and taken deep into their mysteries and profoundness.  Not that I can explain the drawing - it was just that I kept playing the recordings over and over.<br /><br />Normally many cannot listen to an entire disc of such solo violin in one sitting, but with Kremer's probing interpretations, it seemed easy and satistfying in a unique way.  While I admire Rachal Podgers sunny suites and appreciate all the historic recordings and fresh new recordings by the new generation violinists, there was something powerful about a lifelong student of Bach putting his final mark on some of the most profound compositions for violin ever composed.  Same can be said about Milstein, Szernyg and other past greats, but I was draw more to Kremer's readings. Bewitching quality to them and showing a brilliant mastery of the instrument which is by the way a powerful Guaneri del Gesu (the \\"Ex-David\\") made in 1730.  The journey of such an ancient, legendary instrument from the Italian workman's shop in early 18th century to Gidon Kremer in the 21st century is truly amazing to consider.<br /><br />Part of the draw is the truly powerful and amazing sound quality of the ECM recording which is one of the best I own out of 1000 discs.

B0015DYIH2|5.0|this was my favorite book. Eventhough the Jacob part was boring all the stuff in book 1 and book 3 in breaking dawn were very good. i could not put the book down i finished it in a week.
0810979772|5.0|I order this book for my granddaughter for Christmas. She loves it! I was pleased at the low cost offered by Amazon.com and the free shipping with my order.  I placed my order two weeks before Christmas and received my order within one week!  Thanks Amazon!!
0786838655|5.0|So I must admit, when I first thumbed through this book at the store, I rolled my eyes and put it back on the shelf. Skimming the first few pages gave me the impression that Mr. Riordan had simply conjured up a whiny, sarcastic child who would fumble and stumble his way through an impossibly epic legacy, and I would be pissed reading about it. I was not about to waste time on something like that. And even though my sister raved about the series, I almost made it a personal quest to never read these books.    Thankfully, my sister ignored me and included this book among her Christmas gifts.    In this first book of the series, we meet 11-year-old Percy Jackson, a good-natured boy who has been plagued by bad luck and bad circumstances as long as he can remember. At a school field trip to the museum, Percy faces off against a teacher who wants to inflict more than just the pain of detention. The resulting fight for his life puts Percy on a path to discover his special heritage and the responsibilities that such lineage bestows.     I won't pretend that Riordan's first book here isn't, first and foremost, meant for children. The narrative voice, the characters, the plot expositions and twists, these are all decidedly aimed at a youthful audience. Percy is as impetuous and innocent as any 11-year-old, and his sidekicks are not much older (though thankfully, they are oftentimes much wiser). Camp Half Blood, where Percy eventually settles to learn and train as a demigod, is filled with children preparing to fulfill their destiny as the offspring of the Greek pantheon. It's every kid's dream--to have special gifts and talents that set you apart from your peers.     But it's also a dream that adults share, albeit on a more worldly, cutthroat level. Perhaps that is partially the source of universal appeal this book seems to have. We live vicariously through Percy's adventures as someone with greatness on the horizon, mammoth challenges to overcome, and loyal, lovable friendsto help along the way.    Reading THE LIGHTNING THIEF is an indulgence much like watching a Hollywood blockbuster at the theater. It's a story that's not meant to invoke any paradigm shifts, nor does it stir you to action or call you to repentance. But it's a delightful, fast-paced tale that delivers in spades the entertainment and warm fuzzies we all crave. For so masterfully meeting that objective (as well as inspiring me to brush up on my Greek mythology), I can't help but give this book top honors. Call me a sheep. Call me as corrupt or brainwashed as the Academy Award voting body. I don't care. :)
B002X20W2E|5.0|I love this album so much it's really great and all of the songs are really good. I'm sure it's not for everyone (it's called Rated R for a reason) but I like all the songs so much that I could listen to them all day. Rihanna is an extremely talented singer.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This could have been a great book.  But...he must have asked his intern write some long, out of place rants about how true the bible is.  Why justify the lack of clarity in the bible?  Didn't the press from the religious protestors help sell the previous books?
0767834739|5.0|4.5 out of 5<br /><br />The Umbrella Corporation needs to know what happened at the Hive and why it was sealed up afterward, so a team is sent down there to open it. Unfortunately, when they do, they unleash an army of the undead and the T-virus is unleashed on the world.<br /><br />Alice (Milla Jovovich) wanders the streets of Raccoon City, now under quarantine, blasting the heads off of anything dead that moves. Soon she saves Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and crew and the group is quickly contacted by Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris) whose daughter, Angie (Sophie Vavasseur), is still in the city. Umbrella Corporation scanners show her at the school she attends. The deal: if they save his daughter, he'll guide them out of the city and past the perimeter Umbrella has put up to keep the T-virus in. They have to do this before sunrise otherwise they won't make it out before Umbrella nukes the entire city, erasing any trace that the T-virus existed and reanimated the dead.<br /><br />Oh, and the Nemesis Project is online, and it's on the hunt.<br /><br />Usually sequels fail after the first, or if they succeed, it's only by a small margin. Well, Resident Evil: Apocalypse is even better than its predecessor and brings another haul of thrills and chills along with it. In this one the post-apocalyptic feel hangs thick on the air. Raccoon City is in ruins. Cars are overturned and on fire. Bodies and blood litter the streets. Guns are going off in the distance.<br /><br />And zombies are everywhere. Good and gruesome zombies. (I particularly liked the ones featured in the cemetery; the level of rot and decay on those things was exquisite.)<br /><br />In Resident Evil style, dark things lurk in the shadows and the suspense and tension built in this movie is awesome. I jumped I don't know how many times. Even the parts where you go, &#34;Okay, something's going to pop out . . . NOW!&#34; make you jump. Very cool.<br /><br />The fight between Nemesis and Alice was cool along with her other wheelings and dealings with the undead. Her super solider-esque, Matrix-like fighting techniques was a treat to watch.<br /><br />That scene in the school with all those zombie kids? Truly creepy. Adult zombies got nothing on these little terrors.<br /><br />The movie serves as a nice in-betweener for the first and third. The epic scale of storytelling is terrific, and this is one zombie saga I'm eager to see go on, especially when part four (Resident Evil: Afterlife) comes out in 2011.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

0385504225|2.0|It's a good read but it's not what i would call a masterpiece. i expected more from Brown after reading Da Vinci Code.       A good third of the book, if you don't pay close attention can lead to information indigestion. It felt like I was sitting in a lecture during the first 23 chapters or so.    It touched on Noetic Science but i never really saw how it fits in the whole chase. The notion of Noetic Science virtually disappeared after Malakh blew up Solomon's lab. There's a number of anticlimactic scenes.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I just saw \\"Die Hard\\" for the very first time a few months ago and enjoyed every second of it. After watching this movie I became a huge Bruce Willis fan because he's amazing in this movie. The man does all of his own stunts and is a 1-guy arsenal of power and strength. The movie is total action from the moment it starts until the second it ends. Bruce plays his signature character John McClane, a New York cop who comes home to LA to visit his estranged wife for Christmas. When he stops by her office to surprise her little does he know that the entire building is about to get sky-jacked courtesy of a gang of money-hungry German terrorists. What I enjoyed the most about Bruce Willis in this film is that he never gives up and he never backs down to the enemy. Even when everyone else is against him and thinks he is a nut he still doesn't give up. If you have any interest in action pictures you must see \\"Die Hard\\" because it truly is the very best. I have since seen all of the other \\"Die Hard\\" sequels and enjoyed them all immensely because Bruce Willis stayed true to his character throughout every single picture.

1933771690|5.0|I had just finished a halarious read of Cash Peters' Gullible Travels and wanted to do a complete 180. So I picked up this brilliant work about a subject I had no knowlege of, except that I have read many books about quantum mechanics. I didn't say I understand it. I just read about it and tried.    But the good Dr takes a different perspective that slowly buidls a solid foundation for perspective observations/a new kaleidoscopic view of the Alice In Wonderland World/ \\"consciousness/quantumiouss\\". It is a depth detailing of experiments in cosciousness/wave-collapsible/oberservations.    The explanation and journey do take a book. So pick this one up and step through that looking glass once again. This time through you'll find a very convincing case that THE observer is absolutely critical to collapsing to wave function to enable... \\"reality\\".    Fascinating approach. Very convincing. The questions now have a observable spin. Now I wonder about an inverted holographic version. Of course I don't get it. But if you read this this book, it definitely provides another piece of the puzzle for your \\"wonderland\\" looking glass.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!
0393337170|5.0|Wide ranging and written with exceptional clarity. This is by far the best lay man's book about game theory I have come across. A worthy successor to \\"Thinking Strategically.\\"

B002XTBEDI|2.0|I loved the original \\"Cranford\\" on Masterpiece Theatre and have read the book \\"The Cranford Chronicles\\" (which you should all read!).  I have the dvd and have watched it often and find something new in it each time.  The story ends with many story lines tied up but also, some options for future story lines as the characters age and grow.  Brilliant story and cast.  Then comes \\"Return to Cranford\\".  I won't spoil the story for you but while beautiful to look at, the story is shallow and meaningless and except for a few moments, you really won't care (everyone is against the railroad but no one has ever RIDDEN a train, soooooo).  Most of the original actors are there but it seemed to me it was done out of pity for those of us who loved the original and wouldn't want to see new people in these roles or (horrors!) for the money.  Stick to the original and imagine the future.
0307454541|5.0|This is not my normal type of book, but I couldn't put it down. I had to read this for my book club and I finished it in 2 days. I wasn't ready to say goodbye to the characters so I went out and bought the second book and finished that one and can't wait til May when the last one comes out. I had to understand what happened to Lisbeth Salander to make her the way she was. Great Read, I highly recommend this book and the The Girl Who Played with Fire .
B002JTHFV2|4.0|Many U2 fans consider \\"Fire\\" to be the band's crowning achievement.  Indeed tracks like \\"Pride In The Name Of Love\\", and \\"Bad\\" rank right up with the very best material the band has produced.  On the other hand there are a few clunkers to be found here.  Songs like \\"Elvis Presley And America\\" don't really work and a few other tracks come across a bit clumsy as well.   The re-master sounds really good for the most part although it does appear to be highly compressed which is the trend with new albums these days.  Some people find it more annoying than I do, but it is noticeable.  The re-master also includes a 2nd bonus disc of tracks left off of the album, alternate versions and live tracks.  None of this is essential U2, but it is all worth a listen.  \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" is certainly one of the band's best albums and is highly recommended for U2 fans.  Whether or not the deluxe remaster is worth the rather lofty price tag will depend on the listener.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Sometime I like reading just for the entertainment and I feel Mr. Brown does a great job. Having known him since his first novel I found TLS a perfect third episode of Mr Langdon adventures, a modern Indiana Jones lost for the first time in a US City: yes in this book DC is not less fascinating then Paris or Rome and off course you don't have to deal with the absurd exchange rate for the Euro. I don't want to spoil anyone but the only real change in the script is the absence of an attractive young woman for Robert to seduce with his unlimited knoweledge other than that it's pure Dan Brown from head to toe.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout video is great. It is not really for beginners, which I am a complete beginner, but you can do the modified exercises and do it every other day or every two days with one day off to work up to it. Jillian has almost literally kicked my butt with this dvd. I am only on level 1 and man is it tough. BUT, if you want to actually make a difference this is the way to do it. Just be sure to push yourself but not too hard. I already broke a blood vessel in my calf from going past my limits, this is a combination of that and not eating right. Be sure to get all your nutrients, especially vitamin C. All in all, great workout DVD, motivating and very challenging.
B001FB4W0W|2.0|I have read all of these books and really enjoyed them, especially the first 4 or 5.  I recently started a re-read and after having watched the first season of this show, I just have to note how disappointed I am!  I know the novel series is no great body of literature by any means (the term \\"brain-candy\\" comes to mind) but it was certainly smarter than this show!<br /><br />WARNING: If you have not read the books or seen this series, this review is filled with spoilers.<br /><br />First of all, Anna Paquin is NO Sookie.  Her expressions and mode of speech (no, I don't mean the obviously faked accent) are not indicative of innate intelligence.  Just the opposite.  While Sookie had never been to college or had any form of higher education, she was smart.  To escape the bombardment of peoples's minds, she spent a lot of time reading and \\"storing up\\" information for future contemplation.  This Sookie doesn't show any of this.  She's extraordinarily blunt, simple, snappy, has a bad attitude, and is way way way overly dramatic.<br /><br />Secondly, what is with Bill?!  He's supposed to be a Southern gentleman, not a creepy, Ted Bundy-ish flu sufferer!  He's so much colder and withdrawn than the Bill I remember from the books.  That Bill dressed modernly, didn't prefer dark clothing, and was always clean-shaven.  He was respectful and protective, if a bit dense at times.  I could NEVER be comfortable with this Bill.  And he's NOT the one who staked Long Shadow!  Eric did!  And NO penalty was ever shown, let alone a sentence of making a fundamentalist Christian girl into a vampire.  And there is NO such thing as a vampire trial in a junkyard.  Come on, that's totally out of keeping with the feel and intention of the book!  Another gripe - Bill never asked Sam to look after Sookie.  He brought in \\"Bubba\\" to stay in the woods when he went to get his investigator position, NOT to be punished by a vampire court in a scrapyard...ugh!<br /><br />Sookie's grandmother - she was a well-kept, proper Southern lady who took pride in her house.  She was a tiny, slender, well-spoken woman.  She was NOT meant to be a dumpy, unkempt, loopy, slovenly dingbat!  Sookie DOES NOT clean her blood after she's murdered, her grandmother's friends do that.<br /><br />Jason is even more sex-crazed than in the books.  Come to think of it, there is nothing really sexy about the sex in this series.  It's unnecessarily gratuitous, vulgar, filthy, and prevalent.  I love romantic interaction and great, well-orchestrated sex scenes.  These are just gross.  There's nothing there to pique my interest.  Why do men like women to wear lingerie?  Part of the fun is what they can't see, and what they imagine and anticipate.  AND, where the HELL did Amy the psychotic hippy come from?  Jason had dated an Amy Burley who was killed, but she was barely mentioned as a possible replacement at Merlotte's for Dawn Green.  Jason didn't shack up with her and kidnap a vampire they later stake!  Jason never tried V.  He wasn't a drug user of ANY sort.<br /><br />Lafayette was a minor character.  He was flamboyant and comfortable with himself, and he liked wild parties, but he wasn't violent and deeply enmeshed in various, underground ways of making money.  V was a minor part of the book.  No one was dealing it except the Rattrays, and no one was taking it.  Drugs were a minor part of the book.<br /><br />Eric is unattractive and nothing like a Viking.  His accent is nothing like what an ancient Viking would have sounded like.  He sounds more like a putzy neanderthal.  Plus, he was MUCH more concerned about Sookie in the book than in this show, if for no other reason than he's intrigued by her and needs her psychic abilities.  And Pam is WAY too old!  She's supposed to look like a perky cheerleader and be a ruthless, yet wry, vamp.<br /><br />Where the HELL did Tara come from?  I know Sookie had a friend named Tara who ran Tara's Togs the clothing shop.  She's also a minor character.  Did they decide they just needed someone sassy to the point of *ANNOYING* to spice up an already well-beyond-the-most-extreme-of-Indian-cooking-seasonings-out-there style show?  And WHAT is with the back-woods fake exorcisms and the alcoholic, demonic mother?  This is just WAY out there, even for the book series.<br /><br />Sam should be strawberry blond, a WHOLE lot sweeter and more supportive of Sookie, and genuine competion for Bill.  Sam is attractive, alluring, mysterious, and kind.  He's a good boss, he's patient, and he is NOT violent and creepy!  When he goes home with Sookie, she wakes up the next morning to find him in bed, but she doesn't freak out.  She's always interested in Sam, and they have a good relationship.  Plus, he helps her to clean her house the day she's afraid Bill was burned in the vampire nest.  He's there to support and help her.  When Bill rises that night from the graveyard, Sookie is looking for him, not there to drop flowers on his grave, believing he's dead.<br /><br />Andy Bellefleur isn't so openly antagonistic.  He certainly isn't trying to keep Jason in jail after they find Rene is the killer!  He's a good cop trying to do his job, he is just paranoid about anything supernatural.<br /><br />Rene does not attack Sookie in the bar.  She never gets in a car with him.  In the books, he comes to her house, they run through the woods and the graveyard, and she stabs him after he has inflicted various injuries on her.  Sam doesn't save her, Bill DOES NOT rise in the SUNLIGHT to try to help!!!  She takes care of herself in the books, thank you very much.  She realizes he murdered his sister from his thoughts alone, there is NO investigation of a mystery woman she sees in his head a few days before!<br /><br />Bon Temps is supposed to be way more homey.  It's like people from New York got together and said \\"what is your impression of small-town Louisiana?\\" and decided it should be dirty, whory, violent, and suspicious.  These people can be vicious and cruel, but some a genuinely nice.  No one in the show is actually a nice person!<br /><br />And the Maenad with the razorback hog is in the SECOND book!  She wants tribute from Eric.  She DOES NOT know Sam, she only makes direct contact with Sookie, and she is not in the habit of appearing as a social worker to take in people who have gone astray!  WHERE did all this junk come from???<br /><br />I know this would be hard, if not impossible to set up, but I missed \\"Bubba.\\"  That's a part of the book I really got a kick out of.  I wanted to see \\"the man from Memphis\\" in his very bittersweet new \\"life.\\"  And I wanted to see J.B. du Rone too.  Come on, couldn't they find anyone attractive enough who could act that sweet?<br /><br />So many scenes and events from the book are played up to the level of ridiculousness to try to get more of a reaction from the audience.  And shouldn't the show have been produced because people admired the written series?  Ok, so why then do the producers, writers, etc. think they have to throw in SO much extra drama and conflict and so many events that were never even hinted at in the book?!  Have the people of HBO ever, EVER heard of overdoing it?  If not, I refer them back to their own show.  Can they throw any more f-bombs in too?  The f-bomb is the f-bomb because it has impact.  It looses a lot of *oomph* when it's used in every other sentence.  These people are all so violent!  They fly off the handle over EVERYTHING.  Who acts like that, really?  These books were not about sex, drugs, and violence.<br /><br />I just can't relate to any of these people.  I could see things to understand in each person in the series.  I could sympathize, I saw their deeper, nobler sides.  Of course there was violence, depravity, and cruelty, but this show just takes it beyond the limits.  I was told at University while working towards my English major something along these lines: one can write the impossible and get away with it, but not the improbable.<br /><br />I was so excited about this show.  I couldn't wait to watch a series of books I had enjoyed come across my t.v. screen.  I know movies and television can never do literature justice, but this falls well below my standards.  I am terribly disappointed that the world Charlaine Harris's writing built in my head was tainted by watching these.!    And the Maenad with the razorback hog is in the SECOND book!

B001LPWGE6|5.0|I agree with the other reviewer that said opening the box was a challenge.  They should put a sticker on the front of the box.  Quality was excellent.  Picture was a bit better than the regular DVDs however the sound was much better.  All three movies are extremely entertaining.   Can't wait for Bourne #4.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|This film was a nice little surprise.  I missed it entirely when it hit the theater and only rented it because I saw a review on the web.  Shot for only 5 million, this is a nice science fiction thriller.  For the Transformers crowd, there are no big explosions or lasers.  This is a character driven story with the only face you really see is Sam Rockwell.  A few faces appear on monitors, and you get the voice of Kevin Spacey(very HAL).  It is hard to describe the movie without giving anything away.  Earth has exhausted its resources, but on the moon they can mine Helium-3 which is a great energy source.  Sam is alone on the moon for the last 3 years overseeing the automated mining operation.  He is two weeks away from going back home.  But then things start to go wrong and questions arise.  Really a good performance by Sam, especially considering he had no one else to play off of.  There were a couple of little plot holes that I noticed, but it takes away very little from a wonderful story.  Anyone interested in a character driven story with a sci-fi touch, then this a great movie to pick up.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|This has to be among the best nature documentaries ever filmed.  The multi-part series takes you around the globe to places you likely will never visit and animals you otherwise would never see outside of a zoo.  The footage the videographers captured is simply awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Originally, I purchased the DVD version.  I enjoyed it very much, but the video quality was somewhat subpar when upscaled on my HDTV.  Eventually, I picked up the blu-ray version with the intent of selling my DVD set.  The blu-ray looks magnificent; one of the greatest transfers I've seen.  This is clearly the way the filmmakers intended the series to be watched, as they used HD cameras to capture most, if not all, of the footage.<br /><br />However, I now find that I cannot sell my DVD set because all the wonderful extras on the DVD, including an extra disc with a bonus three-part documentary is missing from the blu-ray version.  The blu-ray contains no special features.  Zip.  On the DVD, at the end of each segment, the filmmakers included a 10 minute \\"how they filmed a scene\\" piece, which I found fascinating to watch, as it showed the difficulties they encountered in capturing some of the most amazing footage.  This is noticeably absent from the blu-ray set and really shouldn't have been, even if they just included the special features in standard definition.  I've subtracted a star for this.<br /><br />If you already have the DVD and have a decent sized HDTV, I think the upgrade in visual quality is worth the price, but hold on to your old set for the extras.  If you have neither version, I would recommend the blu-ray set over the DVD because, although it lacks the special features, the video quality has to be seen to be believed.  Either way, this series is a must watch.  I have yet to find someone I personally know who didn't enjoy it.

B000WQWPKA|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray version of the movie.  I've found that the video quality is significantly better than the DVD.  However, it is important to keep in mind that this movie was made in 1996, and some of the effects that looked cool then are less impressive in high-def.  The sound is also wonderful.    As to the film itself, if you haven't seen it, it's a typical Roland Emmerich summer blockbuster movie.  A lot of landmarks getting blown up, unlikely everymen become heroes, etc.  The are plot holes aplenty, which are glossed over by a rising musical score.  The characters are thin and many are nothing more than caricatures.  Regardless, it's amusing and impressive in parts and is a good \\"popcorn movie\\" that offers 2 1/2 hours of mostly mindless entertainment.    Some reviews have complained that the blu-ray disc does not have the \\"extended version\\" on it.  This is true, and normally this would upset me.  However, I've watched both the theatrical and extended cuts on my DVD, and I firmly believe the theatrical version is the better cut.  It's better paced and doesn't get lost with storylines relating to minor characters you really don't care about.  The extended edition simply feels bloated.  Also, on the DVD the scenes added in the extended version are of a noticeably lesser quality than the remainder of the film, which is distracting, so I really don't miss not having the extended cut on blu-ray.
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas because we are both huge Tarantino fans. Also, Brad Pitt helped confirm that I, too would like this movie.    It was very good, well written and well acted, but not what we expected.     Whenever I see a Q Tarantino movie, I brace myself for lots of brutal violence (ie Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction etc) We thought this movie would be about \\"killin' Natsees\\" as the commercials showed.     SPOILER ALERT:    There was only one scene of the actual group of Jewish Soldiers, led by Pitt, \\"killin Natsees.\\" Most the film takes place after Hitler has already heard about \\"the bastards\\" and Hitler's need to have them hunted down.     Also, although I don't mind a good subtitled movie at all, I didn't expect FOUR different languages from Tarantino. (English, German, Italian and French.) All but the English subtitled and the German and French used extensively. I am a FAST reader, and we had to rewind the film a few times, so I could pick up the written dialogue. My poor husband almost gave up and let me narrate, and then he didn't care for that, so we just keep rewinding, because the dialogue was very realistic and rapid fire.     The plot was very complicated, and with the Babel of languages, I really think we HAVE TO watch this film a second and even more times just to get the jist of it.     From what we did get, it was very well done. The cast is larger than I thought it would be, and there were several plots going on at once.     This may herald a new phase for Tarantino. More substance and less violence. More well developed characters and......less violence. Not that there wasn't ANY violence, no, this film was violent. We'd give it a 7 on a scale of 10, with Reservoir Dogs a 9 and Pulp Fiction an 8. He may have left his \\"heads exploding, ears being cut off, people being set on fire while alive and needles plunged into hearts\\" in his past for more substantial work.     As usual the story was very well done. The \\"Historical Inaccuracy\\" (which some people were quite bothered by) didn't bother us, as Tarantino often dabbles in some nearly paranormal or alternative material (what WAS in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction?) in his movies.     All in all, good film, just be prepared to READ (meaning more than one reason to have the kiddies busy with something child oriented in an other room or asleep when you put this DVD to watch.)
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Another wholly original film from Tarantino, and special kudos for his screenplay.  Extremely entertaining with 3 powerhouse performances (Waltz, Laurent and Kruger), but the whole cast is great.  I don't place this one quite as high as Pulp or Kill Bills, but I look forward to watching this again.
B0015UKX7E|5.0|This DVD is highly recommended. It is very entertaining, the  music, the whole team of musicians,the singing, the choreography, the dancing was AWESOME! The other artists in the concert (Lenny Kravitz-American Woman),(Maceo Parker-great sax player), Rosie Gaines, Morris Day & the Time, also the legendary bass player Larry Graham and of course the great, very hot Prince himself. It was a great show. 132 minutes of tremendous entertainment!!!!!!!!!!!   Well worth the money!!!!
0470477237|5.0|Socialnomics is a great book for anyone who wants to understand the impact social media has on our world today. It covers not only how businesses can utilize it effectively, but also how consumers are using it and why. And understanding the \\"why\\" of the audience will help any business successfully leverage social media's benefits. But what I really like about the book is that while it explains this on a higher level, it uses interesting and easy to relate to examples to illustrate the point and bring it to life. This allows the reader to easily correlate it to their own real world experiences. You don't have to be an expert in online marketing or have an MBA from Harvard to understand this book - it is really for every business person who wants to learn what social media means to them, their business and this world.
B00280LYIC|5.0|this book is full of action adventure and mystery   i encourge anyone who loves mythology and history in a fun and action packed way to read this book  rick riordan is a fanominal writer  if you like this book you should also try the other 4 in the series the second book is kind of slow but if you can get throught that one they just keep geting better and better as you work your way throught this awesom series. defiently worth all five stars.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This is the best Alicia Keys album yet. I always like several songs on Alicia's albums, but except for Diary, more than half the songs seems to be just fillers. However, with this album it is the first time she has had so many great songs on one album. This is how an album should be. 2-5 and 9-14 all great songs. And even the others are good fillers. Talented singer as we all know, but with this album also great producers.
0786939532|4.0|In Homeland, R.A. Salvatore introduces us to Drizzt, drow and secondboy in the 9th house of the city of Menzoberranzan. It is the story of Drizzt's early life, his journey from birth to adulthood, as a member of an evil society of dark elves ruled by a dark Spider Queen deity.<br /><br />I am not a role-playing game girl, and am unfamiliar with \\"Forgotten Realms\\" - the game on which the Drizzt books are based. In fact I never would have read this at all if not for my husband. I don't even read a lot of science fiction. So I was caught completely by surprise when I actually enjoyed it.<br /><br />The story is complex, and compels the reader to continue turning pages to see where it will lead next. The setting is intricate and deliciously dark, illustrating the malevolent culture of the dark elves. With great artistry, Salvatore describes the Underdark, and the reader can see it as if it were a wicked painting passing before his eyes.<br /><br />Rich in detail and heavy with an unexpected and deep emotional connection to the characters, Homeland is an excellent fantasy novel. It is an astonishingly well-written introduction to The Legend of Drizzt. I will definitely continue reading this series.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|The turntable works great and is so easy to use. Plug in the power, plug in the USB cable, install the software on the CD, push record and start playing and it records the music. Then comes the slow part, the conversion. It takes forever to convert after you're done recording so be patient!<br />One nice feature is the automatic new track sensor. The software can tell when one track stops and another starts and will automatically start recording a new track for you. After recording, you only have to type the artist and album names once, then you just type in the track names and bam it goes in your iTunes all nice and organized. Sound quality is as good as you can expect from vinyl.
1416550542|3.0|I liked the Forgotten Garden -- and it reminded me so much of the books I read as a young girl -- all the hours spent devouring the Anne of Green Gables series and beyond, that feeling of falling into a book and not wanting to crawl out -- and I did not suffer the problem noted by other readers of the speakers and the eras changing.  However, I found myself somewhat disappointed at the end of the story.  It all started so well and with such strength to tumble so predictably towards this ending.  I found myself with WAY too many questions when it ended, and all of them having to do with all the loose ends the authoress (the actual writer, not the created one) threw in the mix -- perhaps to confuse the reader but to the detriment of the end of the LONG story!  (For example, what was the brother/husband/father/uncle character all about???  Creepy, but in what way and why?  And the boyfriend at the end -- never really fleshed out that story which could have been much more involved.) Otherwise, I do recommend it and did enjoy the story, but even more I liked the way it made me feel -- like a young reader again.
B002TIWQNK|3.0|The Pet Shop Boys are my all time favorite group, however, this CD was somewhat of a dissapointment.  Not only did it only have 5 songs, 2 of which are the same song, but different versions, only one of them was what I consider a Christmas song.  The only redeeming value of the CD was their version of \\"Viva la Vida\\" by Coldplay which I really love.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This mini series is absolutely amazing in blu ray and on a HDTV (it is great on a standard tv too!).  I love to watch this program with my kids and answer all their questions about nature.....I hope they make a Planet Earth 2.
B000002ADT|3.0|So What and Freddie Freeloader, for first offs, never have grabbed my attention.  I can appreciate the subtle beauty in Blue Green and All Blues, but I don't find  modal miracles here (and I admit to not really understanding the modal concepts).  Davis and Coltrane are steady but not animated or creative enough here to deserve the overwhelming accolades.  I'll keep giving it a chance every 5-8 years, however.
B002VH6V9O|5.0|A perfect film , not to be missed ! Romance, Royal Spleandor with a perfect balance of drama and comedy and beautiful music and lovely costumes.
0790737345|2.0|This movie is a pale, watered-down imitation of Wim Wenders classic \\"Wings of Desire\\". See \\"Wings\\" instead.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|One of the most exciting, well written, sit on the edge of you seat series I have ever completely watched. So much of the story lines can be paralled to today's politic and politicians. I've watched it 2 times now back to back.  Make sure you see the director's comments in \\"special features\\".   Well packaged, great design. A keeper. A must see series
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I wasn't familiar with the Baker Street robbery that took place in London in the early '70s and provides the source material for this British picture.  The \\"Bank Job\\" has a lot to really like, but at the top of my list was the amazing recreation of 1971 London --- from the streets of the city to the styling of the clothing and hair of the characters.  This amazing attention to time and place, along with the stellar ensemble cast of petty criminals,  immediately sets the tone for this movie and transports you back to the time of post-60s disillusionment.<br /><br />Unlike other suspense films, \\"The Bank Job\\" doesn't have so many twists and turns that it leaves you confused and frustrated trying to piece together an elaborate jigsaw puzzle.  Perhaps this is because it is based on a true story and the screenplay remains true to the real life events.  I'm still surprised that these petty thieves were able to get away with such a preposterous bank heist.  \\"The Bank Job\\" is an entertaining, fast paced and engaging movie that is well worth a viewing.
0452284392|4.0|Mathematicians, social webs, ecological webs, the internet, cells, financial markets, corporate boards of directors -- they're all a lot alike and we've just discovered that.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I loved this movie.  The fast talking, cut-throat women in this movie were very entertaining.  It was hard to believe there wasn't a single male character in the whole movie but the whole movie was all about men.  Norma Shearer was a new, welcome addition to my old movie library and Joan Crawford as \\"the other woman\\" couldn't have been cast better.  This movie is chock full of leading ladies, each one more interesting and funnier than the next.  The very last scene was rather dated and silly but the overall movie was just plain enjoyable.  My favorite scene was when Norma Shearer's character has a conversation with her mom about her cheating husband.  Her mother's response really dated the movie and made me shudder and laugh at the same time!  All in all, this is a great Saturday/Sunday rainy afternoon movie.
B001G0MFOM|5.0|*** SPOILER'S ALERT *********************  *** SPOILER'S ALERT *********************    I love how no one could figure out who killed Jenny. I blame our school system.    Clues:  1) Nikki got dragged out of the bushes by the cops, while the rest of the girls were sitting quietly in the living room.    2) Nikki said, in the manner of a guilty confession \\"Guys, she was keeping all of you prisoner in this house!\\"  3) Shane ordered Nikki to shut up, probably to prevent Nikki from implicating and incriminating herself.    The killer appears to be Nikki, so much so that I didn't expect anyone to ask about the identity.  That's why Nikki was dragged out of the bush -- she shot Jenny then hid in the bushes.
B001UV4XUG|1.0|It was like watching one long 2 hour conversation between two people.  If I wanted that, then why would I watch a whole movie about it?
B0026P3G12|4.0|A great, solid first album. It leaves a little wanting from the pure,raw performance she first gave on Britain's got talent, but the vocals are amazing with great control. Well worth the purchase to support a dream.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout kicks my butt! I never imagined that 20 minutes could make me sweat so much! The first time I did level 1, I had to stop several times for a breather and a drink of water. I could barely walk for two days! After about a month of doing level 1, I can feel it getting easier, but it's still a really hard workout. I just started level 2 and it is definitely a challenge.    I really like how you can turn off Jillian's voice because she gives a lot of instruction that you only need the first few times. I also like to mute it completely and use my own music. My only complaint is that you can't skip though the introduction and get straight to the workout. It's information that you really only need to hear the first time, but you have to listen to it every time.    Warning: This workout involves a lot of jumping! It is not easy on the knees. It also involves going from the floor to standing quite quickly. I've found myself getting a little bit lightheaded from all the up and down.     I am already seeing and feeling a difference after a month. I definitely think that this workout will help me get the results that I've been looking for!
B000IOM1RI|5.0|This is a great sound track that anyone who liked the movie will enjoy listening to. It has all the tracks played in the movie, plus a few fun extras. The sound quality is very good. The music is great, and the lyrics are hilarious. The parental advisory warning does not lie. There is just as much horrific language on the soundtrack as there is in the movie. But I do mind mind the language that much, I feel it adds to the quirkiness of the lyrics. So, if you enjoyed the movie, you will love he soundtrack. It has all the fun of The Pick of Destiny to go.
0525951113|4.0|Daemon was the first book I ordered for my Kindle.  Wow-what a great premise: a Bill Gates-like genius creates a computer program that begins when he dies.  It is almost like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein in that an inanimate object becomes real and defies death.  The daemon offers it's designer the chance to live forever.  The truly frightening aspect of this story is that it is already happening to an exent.  Take iTunes or any retail website...you order a song/shirt/toy and the program reacts to your request with suggestions for more purchases based on what it perceives to be your interests.  Daemon just takes that program to a whole new level and causes death and ruin to anyone that attempts to stop it's program.  One domino falls after another and you race through the pages wondering if anyone or anything can stop it.  Trust me on this, it is a hard book to put down.  It grabs your interest on page 1 and doesn't let go.  The only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5, is that the ending was weak.  In my opinion, there were character threads that were not resolved.  It was almost if the author thought that he had written enough and just put \\"The End\\" on the page.  The story is anything BUT done by the last page.  I was left in limbo and with questions that were not answered.  The story needs a part 2, if you ask me.    But, the story as a whole is exciting, surprising and unfortunately, very scary in today's computer age.
0385504225|2.0|The first 300 pages should have been only 30, enough to set the scene. The other 270 pages were just fluff.    The next 150 pages were very well done, exciting action, surprising revelations and creative twists, with a satisfying conclusion.    And then there are 50 pages of New Age preaching....reminded me of \\"The Celestine Prophecy\\".
0439023491|5.0|I read this book immediately after the first one.  At first, I was not happy with the way the book was going... didn't know if I could survive another hunger games!  But it was equally as enthralling at the first one for me.  Now, I just have to wait for the third one, which I am eagerly anticipating.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|The book is much more philosophical than Bladerunner, but is very interesting in its own right.  Don't read it expecting Harrison Ford's Decker.
0439023483|5.0|I had read the excellent reviews so I had high hopes for this book.  I was not disappointed.  It really kept me on the edge of my seat, and up too late.  I read the first and second books back-to-back, and can't wait for the third.
0375704027|3.0|This novel is suffused with death.  Various characters flirt with it, and the main character knows several people who have committed suicide.  Whether he is trying to describe a \\"lost generation\\" of Japanese young adults is unclear.    I do like the flat, affect-less tone, the almost deliberate avoidance of cultural markers (except for place names like Shibuya, Shinjuku --  all great shopping districts with congregations of young people).  All the young women are obssessed with death and sex.  The young man at the center (I was about to say \\"heart\\" but changed my mind) is apparently irresistible to the ladies, as he can always find someone willing to sleep with him.  The young women are as casual about their bodies as the young man is about his affections.    Several times, his women friends tell him he has a \\"unique\\" way of thinking. This usually follows a line of his dialogue.  That makes it funny:  the line comes off flat, but the female response is almost always admiring.  Hence, the comedy.    I have no idea what the main protagonist looks like, but in spite of his self-deprecating ways, assume he must be magnetic.      The student protests are so much window dressing.    My favorite parts of the novel are the sanatorium scenes (the landscape is described with very plain language, but still manages to be evocative, don't ask me how Murakami manages to pull this off) and the scenes of Midori's dying father in the hospital.  I also like the other chick magnet, Nagasawa.    If the evidence of this novel is to be believed, many Japanese women have a certain \\"je ne sais quoi\\", a kind of laissez faire attitude that young American women can only hope to emulate ...
B000VDDWE2|3.0|Well this is another disaster film, but just not as good as most out there. Compared to Twister, The Core, Deep Impact, and even some of the TV flicks its pretty pale. The idea is kind of clever, but really there isn't much scientific proof to back it up, yes i suppose if the current was messed up by to much fresh water being poured into the ocean from melting polar ice caps we would have a problem. But this is really something we would never see in our life time, as he says in the beginning of the film. Dennis Qaid is a fine actor, not great but good, also Jake Gilenhal is decent, but this film just takes itself to seriously and the script it just pretty bland. Much like a made for TV movie it plays out the same, and the actors pretty much just run through the motions of reading there lines. As usual, like Independence Day no one really believes whats going on, and the politicians are all scarmbling to figure out what they should do about the crisis. Been there done that. Well since this movie came out in 2004 we have had a few more similar movies, but nothing special, The Core i felt was actually more original, but much less plausible than this film. And the acting was also a lot better. Onto the effects, well on blue ray they look well, clearer, and sharper. I wouldnt put them up there with a film like 2012, War Of The Worlds, or even Twister for that matter which was made back in 1996, but they are good for what they are. Debri looks good, and most of the weather looks pretty convincing, but probably the worst part of the film is the water, most of the flooding doesnt look that realistic, as it consumes Manhattan Island and the Statue Of Liberty as well, this has been done a lot of times, this being the worst. The tornadoes look pretty tv-ish when they hit L.A, except for certain parts when they hit building, as i said the after math and things flying through the air look pretty good. I would say the high light of the film is at the end when the Statue Of Liberties arm and torch are sticking up out of the snow, and most of the city is buried in it. So all in all The Day After Tomorrow(which spawned The Weather Channels) It could Happen Tomorrow doesnt really leave a good or bad taste in your mouth after viewing it, its just kind of there, so basically you watch it, say enh not bad, and move on to something else. A decent C+ or a disaster movie sure to rip through the late night features on TV, which the movie looks more like its made for anyway. Could have went straight to DVD actually.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot! Meryl Streep is perfect as Julia Child in a performance that never seemed anything less than reverent, and she alone is worth the price of admission. Amy Adams is good as the blogging Child devotee who takes on the task of recreating every recipe in Child's seminal cookbook, and together these two actresses deliver a very nice treat of a movie.<br />The movie criss-crosses back and forth between Child's years in France and Julie Powell's years in Queens and the similarities are fascinating. Dual story lines only work if they are woven together to make a greater product, and so it is with Julie and Julia.<br />Underscoring the storyline regarding Julie's daunting undertaking are the twin relationships of the ladies. Streep and Tucci (both are always so good) bring such a warmth and believability to their supremely supportive marriage. On the other hand, Adams and Chris Messina as her husband Eric, do a good job of showing a different albeit equally loving marriage, strained at times by the mania of Julie's increasingly self-absorbed lifestyle.<br />As in so many movies, however, Streep is the reason to check this out. But beyond her Oscar-worthy role, there are funny, sweet, endearing, and beautiful moments in this hard to resist movie.
0786838655|3.0|I've heard a lot about this book and series, enough that I was concerned it might not live up to my expectations. Pleasantly, though, I was (mostly) not disappointed. I liked that the main characters were fairly well-written. None of them were complete saints or pure evil, which happens far too often in books for young readers. That said, the book felt a little too crammed for me. It introduced so many characters and places that I didn't feel like I got a chance to enjoy seeing some of my favorite Greek myths brought to life before the book was on to the next allusion. I wish there had been one or two fewer cameos, but I guess that could have slowed the pace of the book down too much. Overall, I think I'm intrigued enough to continue with the series.
B001U7FWM8|2.0|Grizzly Bear has made a gorgeous, haunting, evocative album -- unfortunately, that album is called Yellow House and was released three years ago.      The hype surrounding this release was that the band had perfected their sound and created a masterpiece.  I have strived mightily to enjoy this recording.  However, this is largely an OK album that has some good moments and a very few great ones.  The best moments are those that sound nothing like Yellow House -- the worst sound like pale imitations of it.  Of course, Grizzly Bear has the talent to break free from Yellow House and make another incredible album.  This one is not it.       Obviously some people love this album.  Despite really, really wanting to like this, I find it boring.  I have given it five full listens and can't imagine playing more than 3 or 4 selected tunes from it again.  Yellow House created an expansive atmosphere that was impossible to resist.  This album holds you at a distance and seems to want to be admired.      An earlier review mentioned this is Grizzly Bear's In Rainbows.  To that, I say, Sir, I know and love In Rainbows, this is no In Rainbows.      Given the talent and originality that emerged on Yellow House and some other side projects, hopefully these guys can let the idea of Grizzly Bear get out of the way and make beautiful music again.
B0021L8UPS|1.0|Normally a movie like this would make the audience question if the child really is evil or if the recovering alcoholic mom grieving her stillborn child is losing it, but not Orphan.  No, the audience immediately finds out that Esther is absolutely evil.  There are few surprises in this contrived plot.  Most disappointing was the \\"chilling alternate ending.\\"  There's no context for the scene, so while it might be \\"chilling\\" under some circumstances, there's no way to know what crimes Esther has committed before this ending.
0812973992|4.0|This book is beautifully and brilliant written by Colum McCann.  Colum takes you on a journey through a wide variety of interlinked characters in New York City on the day Philippe Petit dares to walk between the Twin Towers.     Colum's goal is to place the reader inside the shoes of people who walk the wire on a daily basis.  The reader feels and hears the thoughts of: several different prostitutes who live in poverty and whom cling to each other to survive, a monk who struggles with living out the oath he took and living like Christ in the poverty stricken slums of New York, and a recovering junkie who wants to shed her past lifestyle.  All of these characters along with several more, make one day in NYC seem like a lifetime.
B000X107GI|5.0|5 batteries as advertised and the picture shows it. Great buy for the price and free shipping. You just can't beat it. Highly recommend.
B002X02V02|1.0|This album would have 5 stars from me if it was not censored. Too bad. Why even bother putting the F word in a song if you're going to bleep it out? Come on! Amazon needs to mention SOMEWHERE that this is censored...I would not have bought it. I understand that parents don't want their kids to hear \\"bad words\\" (actually, I don't really understand it-like they don't KNOW what the real lyrics are), but for adults, this is absolutely stupid. THIS is why people download bootlegged versions of things: Not because they are cheap, but because they don't want an INFERIOR product.
B001CDLATE|5.0|Spectacular.  There's no other word for it.  There's not very many titles I'm going to re-purchase on Blu Ray; however, this is one, and it is well worth it.  The transfer is stunning.  I can't believe how awful the dvd version looks to me now.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I love this case.  It's incredibly easy to get the ipod in and out of.  It hooks to the arm band very easily and comes out to hook on your pants just as easily.  I've even dropped it several times, and my ipod was protected.  It doesn't interfere with any of the workings of the Ipod ie. camera, earphone jack...

B00275EGX8|5.0|One of the most subtle threads that runs through every battlefield encounter is how the chance reaction of one person effects the lives of others.<br />In the opening scene, the TeamLeader dies because Eldridge hesitates to shoot the man with a cellphone detonating a bomb.<br />A current political point: The soldier who fails to shoot (and hence doom Thompson, the team leader) would have been severely punished had he shot in error. This is the same scenario created for our current Security People with Racial profiling, civil rights and every other sympathizer-effort to support the rights of those trying to kill us, while our agents are threatening with termination should they make an error.<br />This is a one-of-a-kind movie as far as the depth of Sgt James in his obsession is concerned, and it is pulled off beautifully, intelligently and in a manner that never lets go of the viewer for a moment. I will be watching for future efforts by the writer and director.
0786838655|3.0|This is the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians Series.  There has been a lot of hype for the book and the previews for the movie look awesome, but I have to say I was disappointed.  It's not Riordan's fault, I just went in with unrealistic expectations.  There were too many things that reminded me of Harry Potter (2 boys 1 girl, the set-up of the schools, even security named Filch) I found myself constantly comparing the two and The Lightning Thief didn't create the same connection for me.<br /><br />The connection was my biggest problem.  I didn't feel connected to the characters.  I didn't care if they lived or died.  The book, however, remained a page-turner because the story was so interesting I couldn't wait to find out what happened.  I just didn't care if the bad guys beat the good guys.<br /><br />Aside from that and each chapter being written like a mini quest where Percy would have to overcome an attack of some kind, it was a good book.  I wish it was around when I was little and needed to learn about Greek Mythology.  It is exciting to think that so many kids are interested in these books and can learn about something that I never really took interest in when I was a kid.<br /><br />My hope is that I will feel more connected with the next book now that I have gone through an entire book with these characters.  Although, even if I don't, I am sure I will finish the series because I can't wait to see how it all ends.

076532413X|3.0|I have been watching the television series that is based upon this book, so I figured I would check it out. The concept is great and had a lot of potential to become something wonderful, which the television series is. This book is one of the few instances where the on-screen version is much better than the written counterpart. The series is more compelling and suspenseful, with more characters that the audience grows more attached to. The book was quite wordy at the wrong times, mostly with nonsense, and left me painfully trying to finish it. My advice would be to skip this read and just watch the series.
0783225482|5.0|Many people say this is a mocking of Hollywood stereotypes but little did Mr. Zemeckis and the writers know that barely a decade later we would have become as vain as we ever have. This is a satire of society in general anymore. As someone who works in the \\"plastic\\" industry and sees what people do their faces and bodies in their effort to stop/stall the aging process, this movie really ought to be on network TV like Wizard of Oz is every year! Perhaps people would see that aging is a badge of honor in itself and they shouldn't be so hard on themselves. Anyway, back to the movie: it is so funny and the stars are so good! Bruce Willis is practically unrecognizable at first. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I don't have Showtime, and don't really watch all that much TV.  But I am completely hooked on Dexter.  Just finished watching the 3rd season, and loved it as much as the first two.  I would recommend this series to anyone.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I'm going to be honest when I first saw a preview for Avatar it looked like just a regular movie with great special effects.   So i'll start by saying my friends had to convince me to go see this movie on opening weekend we went Saturday night it was sold out. I had interest in the movie but was just going to wait till it hit dvd. I left the theater blown away by what I just saw and told my friends that Avatar is my favorite movie ever made and im pretty sure they agreed with me by how we talked about it. I can't reccomend another movie at this level i've seen thousands of movies over the years and for what I thought this was going to be compared to what it was is just stunning. Amazing special effects, great story, taking the best from all the top movies out there and making it even better. For a movie thats 3 hours long I could have been there for another 2 before I started hurting lol, I could keep watching and watching this movie it's just that damn great. The previews do this movie no justice I can't wait to have this in my blu ray collection. Go see this in theaters it's the best place too see this movie.
1904920209|5.0|I recently started making my own bread, beginning with a sourdough starter from San Fransisco. I made a few loaves which tasted fair and looked poor.  My wife dutifully tried them and said nothing.     A few weeks later, she gave me this book for Christmas.  I started easy with the first recipe in the book, a white dough fougasse.  The wife was hovering near the oven before the bread even came out because it smelled so good.  She had some in her mouth within 2 minutes of it coming out of the oven and exclaimed \\"this is the first good bread you've made! It's wonderful!\\"    The DVD is enormously helpful in figuring out how to \\"work the dough.\\" By my third batch, the dough was ready to rest in under 10 minutes of \\"working\\" so it is not that hard to pick up.    Since that first fougasse, I have made a few more batches of the white dough and made more fougasse, some baguettes, and some small rolls. All of them have turned our marvelously!  Beautiful crust and nice airy crumb on the baguette.      I cannot recommend this book enough for a beginner.  It makes baking easy, fun, and exciting.  I find myself looking for an extra hour so that I can run to the kitchen and make some bread.
0307408833|1.0|I've been making delicious vegan baked goods for a while now, thanks to cookbooks including Vegan with a Vengeance, Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World, and The Joy of Vegan Baking. I received the Babycakes cookbook as a gift, and was excited to try some new twists on vegan recipes for desserts. I opted to make the red velvet cupcakes with vanilla frosting. After blowing probably $25 on ingredients I wouldn't normally use (coconut flour, soymilk powder, coconut oil), and after following the very detailed (maybe a little preachy?) instructions both in the recipes and in the beginning of the book, I ended up with bland, dry cupcakes and a container full of oily sludge flecked with coconut.  I composted the whole batch and will not be trying any other recipes in this book!  Specific criticisms include: 1) The recipes are not gluten free.  I am not gluten intolerant, but if you're going to scroll 'gluten free' on the cover of your cookbook, that's a pretty serious statement for people who ARE gluten intolerant!  Not something to mess around with... 2) Coconut oil comes in various varities, such as virgin, extra virgin, etc.  No where in the cookbook is the question of which type to use addressed. 3) Coconut oil is solid in the jar.  When a recipe calls for, say, 1/3 of a cup of coconut oil, how should one measure it out?  Melt it first and measure it as a liquid?  Or fight to chip it out of the jar and then pack it down into the measuring cup? This is another issue that wasn't addressed anywhere. 4) Coconut oil tastes like, well, coconut.  The vanilla frosting was way too coconut-flavored for my tastes, thanks to the coconut oil and coconut flour. 5) After poking around online, I've seen lots of comments claiming that the vanilla frosting recipe used at the bakery is not the same as what's in the book.  I can only really think of 1 reason why the original recipe isn't shared here.  If you don't want to give away your trade secrets that's fine, but then why go on to pretend like you are?      As for me, I'm sticking with Isa Chandra Moskowitz's and Terry Hope Romero's cupcake recipes.  So soft, moist, decadent, flavorful, cute.... everything cupcakes should be!  And, Isa's and Terry's cookbooks are entertaining and readily accessible to all... no celebrity endorsements required!
006176759X|4.0|This novel by reality TV starlet Lauren Conrad chronicles the lives of Jane Roberts and her best friend, Scarlett Harp, as they move to LA and become the stars of a reality TV show. The book, which is based loosely on Conrad's own life, is a little slow in the beginning, but picks up a bit once Jane and Scarlett are discovered at a club by a TV producer.<br /><br />From that point on the two, though a little hesitant at first, decide to audition for the show and their lives change drastically.<br /><br />While Jane takes to the cameras being around easily, Scarlett is not so excited and wonders what she got herself into.  Throw into the mix two other cast members, Gaby, a total ditz, and Madison, a total witch with a nice girl facade, and things get even more complicated.<br /><br />When Jane starts dating Jesse, who happens to be the best friend of her friend-slash-major crush, Braden, things spiral out of control quickly and the jealousy of someone Jane thought she could trust ruins her life in an instant.<br /><br />With lots of run-of-the-mill Hollywood cliches (blondes, drugs, cosmetic surgery, etc), L.A. CANDY almost fails to deliver an original storyline. In addition, in pretty much every single chapter, Jane and her friends are drinking (usually vodka soda for Jane) making it seem to the unknowing person who has never been to LA that you can't have any fun in Tinseltown without being drunk.<br /><br />It is a quick and light read that would be great for the beach or a day when you don't need any actual depth in what you're reading. However, the ending is a cliffhanger and leaves you wanting to know what happens to Jane next.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Angela S.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|I didnt get to see the movie at the cinema, however I bought the DVD in December 09 , when I first started playing the movie I wasnt in the mood and didnt initially get what Baz wanted to do with this project and his particular interpretation of the story. After 20 minutes I turned it of (that December night) and revisited the movie again last night. My wife wasnt keen to try and watch it again however I mentioned to her (and reminded myself) dont forget how Baz makes his movies. Afterall his style is unique and sets him apart from many other filmmakers.<br />I loved Moulin Rouge (infact I've probably watched it more than any movie I've ever seen), so to the review, the love epic that is 'Australia' has it all, a great opening, spectacular scenery, fantastic actors, an enjoyable story line, engaging chemistry between the two leads, and a whole lot more.<br />The critics were very unkind to this movie, disgraceful infact that it was so pilloried by so many. Why should relationships between people be depicted as perfect in any movie, afterall the notion of a perfect relationship is ridiculous, some gentle escapism, entertainment on a grand scale, love, pathos, action and some emotional spikes<br />are all aspects of another Baz Luhrmann movie success. I hope he continues to create movies in his style, he doesnt need any tall poppy criticism, just support and love for his craft.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Some bands material just gets better with age.  High Voltage shows not only what was to come but much furhter beyond other bands AC/DC were in 1976.  Angus already had his chops well rehearsed and Bon was already a force to be reckoned with.  Sad that he was headed on a path to final destruction and death.  This album is chalked full of classics destined for constant radio and LIVE rotation with T.N.T., Live Wire, The Jack, and Its a long Way to the Top
B000005H4H|5.0|Excellent album. You probably know what you're getting if you're getting this, so on to the details. This is not a 180g album (and is not advertised as such) that is a 2008 repressing. On the back of the cover it says \\"Mastered from the analog masters by Ron McMaster.\\" Plenty of 'master' in that statement. The good news is that if you're buying vinyl to get analog sound then this is it.<br /><br />Further, the cover apperars to be the vintage-looking style from original release complete with blurbage from Herbie and Nora Kelly with the addition of the most current FBI warnings. Manufactured in USA by The Blue Note Label Group - [...].<br /><br />The CD that comes with this is inside the cover (not the sleeve) in it's own sleeve (not a jewel case). The album had plenty of sleeve dust on it which I removed with my handy microfiber brush. The ...ahem... maiden voyage of Maiden Voyage was fabulous. Played great, sounded great.
B002M27QQK|4.0|So much's been said about Lady GaGa this past year, her provocative fashion, desire to shock and uncanny ability to create a killer hook which included five US Top 10 singles by now. Then there was the comparison to Madonna, Christina Aguilera and Gwen Stefani.<br /><br />The truth is Lady GaGa makes darn good electropop music and she is not ashamed of it. There's no hiding behind the art or talk of being eclectic. The Fame Monster is not so much a breakthrough but a showcase of GaGa's talent of creating catchy songs. Bad Romance, while unfairly compared to some of her past hits, is a stomper, the sort that belongs to a fashion runway. The big chorus and somewhat erratic vocals speak of the joys of a bad romance. Other standout tracks include the celebrity-name calling Dancer in the Dark with all its electronic stutter (and we haven't heard such stylish name calling since Madonna's Vogue). Then there's the insidiously infectious Monster and So Happy I Could Die where GaGa sings about loving that lavender blond and touching herself. Of course, Beyonce pays a courtesy call on Telephone, a sort of a followup to their collaboration Video Phone, but ten times more danceable and catchy. Then there's the sole emotional ballad, Speechless, which by the end, would have left one wondering if GaGa had sung about brokenhearted self.<br /><br />The Fame Monster continues where The Fame left off. I only wish it were longer especially when this is the deluxe edition. Including her videos and live performances would have been great given that the printed visuals are stunning.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I've had the X41 head set for a little while now and it really does perform well. I'll break this down into a few parts:    Overall feel: On your head these are pretty comfortable for my big round head. They feel light wight and pretty well balanced even for a session of long use. The mic boom seems a little oddly positioned, and the rotation on it is very stiff so much so that I worry about accidentally grabbing the boom and breaking it. Make sure you rotate from the base of the boom, and the arm itself.    Ease of use: Pretty straight forward for use. Plug-in the USB cable, and optical cable into your XBOX, stick in the batteries and turn on. Done.    XBox Live: You are still tethered to your controller. I think this is more a function of what MS provides developers than anything else. This is frustrating if you want to leave the room for a moment but continue a conversation with other players. You have to drag your controller with you too. Just be aware of this. I new it going in, but some folks may not realize it. If you are not using the mic, then you don't need to be tethered.    Sound quality: The most difficult thing to rate since everyone's hearing is so different, and their impression of quality varies so widely. I will say that the sound is very good, maybe a little tinny at times, but that may very well just be the games I've played. No it is not a high definition sound system, but it is very acceptable if not better than most basic all in one systems. These are night and day better than any built in TV sound.    Issues: The minor issues as noted elsewhere. There is often a very slight hiss. This is more often noticed when tethered to the controller, so I would surmise that the cause is thusly related. An even slighter his is sometimes present even without the tethering, but it is so faint that it become imperceptible with any other sound in the room or from the XBox. The cracking and popping. Yes, this does exist. I would guess that I average it happensmaybe once or twice in a couple of hour session where it is annoying. Nothing to bad, or loud, but disrupting if you are in the heat of battle or some such game event. There are slightly more frequent tickles as as opposed to an actual crack/pop. In my case this too are rare, but do occur. I have this device just about 3 feet from a wireless n access point, and actually have several access points thorough out the house. If this is the cause it is minor enough to be acceptable.    Overall: I purchased these for two reasons. I wanted a better sound experience than my Samsung sound bar for playing FPS games online. The sound bar is fine for most things, but not so much for positional awareness. These helped immensely. The second reason I bought these is because I can't stand the default Xbox headsets, or any other I have seen. I even more so can't stand wires. Especially those strung across my clean living room. The MS wireless headset is atrocious both in form and comfort. No thank you. 5 min with that thing it I was glad I never bought one. I would purchase these again, but probably wouldn't recommend them to a friend mostly based on price. Most people I know don't care about wires or not, so I just can't say it is worth it for the people I know.
B002Q9MZF6|3.0|This was everything I expected and hoped for from a singing and acting perspective; however, I am a little disappointed with the directing.  First of all, I don't think the original libretto implies that Mimi and Rodolfo became intimate before leaving for Momus at the end of Act I.  Also, especially given the fact that no libretto or synopsis is provided, it would have been helpful for those not familiar with the story if a \\"caption\\" had been placed at the beginning of each act, stating its time setting.  Unless one knew otherwise, there is no way to know that Act II is on the same evening as Act I, nor that Act III is a couple of months later.  On a positive note, I thought the \\"final shot\\" was both inspired and effective.    David Ferland
0805091742|5.0|This book was very helpful to me. I edit a newsletter.  We have circulation 1700.  This book gave me things to consider in the beginning of the process and along the way.  He talks about the construction business.  You need to extrapolate a little.  He talks about operating rooms.  He says there are 2 things you need in complicated situations: 1) knowledge, 2)the correct application of the knowledge.  He tells you what that means.  The book is at a big discount (see Amazon).  You should have a look.
0805080120|5.0|The book provides a fascinating description on the birth and history of human languages. On top of the bare facts, the writer's remarkable teaching and story telling talents capture the reader. Anecdotes and facts are combined perfectly and the book is easily readable without compromising intelligence.  It left me hungry for many other linguistics books, hoping they would stand up to this level of interest.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|While the big movies often come with a lot of CGI and heavy promotion, this one flew under the radar. I read some reviews and rented it first and decided this is one worth owning. You don't have to have grown up in the 80s to get into the characters or story, but if you did, you will pick up a lot of details that give this movie some inside extras.     From main to supporting rolls, the work is great and as the movie develops you start to understand the depth of character development, not only in the main but also supporting characters. It is a movie that makes you laugh and think, it stuck with me after it was over which is what a good movie should do.
B002QS5OQ4|1.0|I love Star gate sg1 and Atlantis but SGU is a big pile I hope it is a short lived project.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Had the limited edition brief case version on DVD for some time and decided to get the HD box set now I have a Blu Ray player.    It's great to have the movies in HD but unfortunately the extras including the Dangerous Days documentary are in regular 480p (DVD resolution).    Secondly mine came with no copy of The Final Cut, instead the Work Print version was contained on the first disc. I am currently awaiting a reply from Warner Home Video as to weather they can send me a replacement.    Thirdly, as other people have mentioned in their reviews the packaging and presentation is inferior to that of the DVD release.
0061339202|5.0|Amazon already did a good job summarizing Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's Flow, so I will instead focus on evaluating its content.<br /><br />The book is set up in a way where the first few chapters concentrate on defining and analyzing the intricate relationship between human consciousness and happiness. Once this is firmly established, Csikszentmihalyi goes on to introduce the concept of flow, its physiology and its conditions.  All subsequent chapters then examine flow in various aspects of our lives and the last chapter focuses on the philosophical implications of the concept and whether it relates to finding \\"meaning in life\\".<br /><br />It has been said in science that any researcher should have the ability to explain their theory clearly and concisely to a layman. I felt that Csikszentmihalyi's style of writing is very true to this statement, as he puts in a particular effort to make his book accessible and very easy to read for just about anyone.  I would even say that he is overly simple to a fault - using a philosophically-conversational tone at the expense of a slightly more rigid \\"literature review\\" style that predominates more modern pop sci books. Despite this, the author is still capable of conveying a decent amount of science and methodology behind his discovery and analysis of the optimal experience model.<br /><br />To me, the most powerful chapters were really the first five where, as I discussed earlier, Csikszentmihalyi really puts the meat on the bones of his theory of flow and masterfully connects everything together. Some passages just made so much sense that I had to put the book down and seriously contemplate about what is being said and how it relates to my entire understanding of life. To use the author's own language it put me in a very deep and enjoyable \\"flow of thought\\".<br /><br />The book does have a small blemish in the fact that it gets a bit repetitive when it goes into listing the occurrence of flow in everyday settings. I don't have anything against the discussion of applicability of the theory, it just seems that sections containing very similar messages could have been condensed.  Perhaps 240 pages (not including notes and references) is a bit much for this type of format and ideally it should have been closer to 200 pages. However, I want to emphasize that this small fault does not in any way make the book a \\"drag\\" and some people may find this \\"extra\\" information rather useful.<br /><br />To conclude, I found Csikszentmihalyi's lifelong research, his findings and the overall message of his work extremely compelling and powerful. The theory of flow does an excellent job describing many aspects of our lives and most importantly sheds light on the conditions of happy and meaningful existence. I would honestly recommend this book to anyone. It is rather short and very readable and guaranteed to make you analyze your life and the life of your friends and family through the lens of the theory of flow.on of applicability of the theory, it just seems that sections containing very similar messages could have been condensed.

B002OEBMN4|5.0|This is the best Slayer CD since 'South of Heaven'. I like it more than 'Seasons in the Abyss'. I wasn't expecting them to put this type of effort together this late in their career, but this is some great thrash! Anyone slamming this CD is crazy or not a thrash fan. The production is PERFECT for Slayer -- the guitars, the drums, the vocals...perfect. The songs are varied and interesting and I can't believe I am giving them 5 stars. Even though 'Reign in Blood' and 'South of Heaven' are better, I still gave them 5 stars for being my favorite cd of the year.
0920668364|2.0|I never read this book as a child...I first encountered it at a used book sale with my three sisters and my niece and nephew, ages 5 and 3.  Apparently, my younger sister's father (my former stepfather) used to read it to her when she was little and she wanted to buy it for sentimental reasons.  We all looked at it (it has a reasonably cute cover of a boy pulling toilet paper off the roll), and immediately burst into shrieks of laughter.  Crawling across the floor to your kid?  Driving across town?  With a ladder?  To break into your adult son's window and cradle him like a baby?  Even my 5 year old niece thought that the mother's stalkerish behavior coupled with the mantralike lullaby was so creepily unrealistic that it was just downright funny.  We ALL had a real good, loooong hearty laugh about this book.    I have seen the book numerous times at used book sales and stores, and it has come to be known in our family (especially among the children) as the hilarious and funny creepy mommy book.  We don't try to treat it as realism--I guess it all depends upon how you contextualize things for your kids.  I never even noticed the Freudian over/undertones that some of the other reviewers were mentioning.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I received my Beatles in Mono set yesterday, and have already listened to everything (and there is a lot here).  Al I can say is that I am extremely impressed.  The sound quality is better than I have ever heard the Beatles, and subtle differences in the mixing are usually for the better, despite my having grown up with the stereo mixes.  For me the song \\"Taxman\\" was the best example of why you need the Beatles in Mono set.  I love this song, but even after 37-years of listening (when I discovered the Beatles) I never knew there was a cowbell in there.  Of course I never knew it, it isn't on the stereo mix.    All of the albums have such gems, and while there are a few songs in which I prefer the stereo mix, on the whole I imagine I will listen to the mono albums more often (I bought both sets).    As other reviewers mention, the sound quality is so much cleaner, but that is also true of the stereo set.  Paul's bass and Ringo's drums get the biggest boost, but overall everything is cleaner and most distinct.    What was off-putting is the lack of sound stage, which I expected.  There are just some sounds that I've become accustomed to hearing from the left or the right, and that are now, with everything else, in the center.  Of course, songs like \\"I Am The Walrus\\" lose a lot of their mysticism when the stereo effect is taken away, but for the most part the superior mixing of the mono versions offsets any disadvantage.    Its like I was just introduced to The Beatles again, yesterday, and now I get to start obsessing over their brilliant music all over again.
B001P22HK8|5.0|This book is awesome.  I had no idea what I was in for when I started reading it.  I was totally expecting something... well, something less exciting.  I was certainly surprised!  It's a great techno-thriller, jam packed with action, suspense, mystery, and emotion.  And even better, the sequel (Freedom) is out now! Don't miss it!!!
B00275EGX8|5.0|This movie is a must see! The action is very realistic! Don't miss this one.....
B002OFWG7O|5.0|If you are looking at this CD, you are probably doing so because either (1) You like the Foo Fighters, but don't own much of their music, or (2) You own several cds and are wondering whether you need to buy their greatest hits cd as well.<br /><br />The answer to both questions is simple: buy the disc.<br /><br />Although I don't consider myself a die hard fan, I have acquired all of their cds over the years.  Most of their cds are very good, but there are a number of throw away tracks on each and I always find myself hitting the skip button on the cd player at least two or three times per cd.  This Greatest Hits collection is well assembled and features damn near all of the songs you could hope for from a Greatest Hits package from them.  Additionally, the inclusion of acoustic version of Skin and Bones and Everlong are fantastic (and will keep you from having to buy the Skin and Bones acoustic cd, which is good, but whose only stand out track is included here).<br /><br />The new songs of the disc aren't great.  \\"Wheels\\" sounds like something they recorded a few years ago, but wisely decided not to include on any other cd.  It is very boring rock, and always reminds me of something a lesser band would have recorded (although Dave Grohl's vocals almost save it).  \\"Word for Word\\" is standard Foo Fighters fare and would have fit perfectly on pretty much any Foo Fighters album.  The song is strong, but not as good as the greatest hits collected here.  It is worth a dozen listens or so.<br /><br />The real reason to buy this disc is the bonus DVD, which includes (as far as I can tell) every, or nearly every video the Foo Fighters have ever made (plus a few live performances).  The DVD is strong, and easily makes this set worth purchasing.<br /><br />Altogether, a great collection.
B00275EGX8|3.0|3.5 stars<br /><br />The Hurt Locker might be a masterpiece for some, and seem realistic (if not to those who actually did this job in Iraq: see the low-starred reviews here). But it felt way too slow for me, and disconcertingly unwilling to address anything beyond the minutiae of each defusing event. I never really got much chance to care for any of the characters, though there was some nice ironic humor. Mostly I wanted to be involved beyond the obvious will-it-blow-up tension, yet rarely was.<br /><br />I sure couldn't wait to see it, and rented the blu-ray the day it came out. It looks good, and Bigelow has a nice eye. But somehow it all felt oddly prosaic. No doubt this is a brutal job, and it's an interesting topic for a film, yet I never felt like I had a chance to get to know anyone here enough to care much about them. Perhaps that's the point?<br /><br />I was interested by the comments on the one and two star reviews here, and on other boards. Apparently a lot of EOD experts find this film annoyingly innaccurate, while many film fans point to that as unimportant; \\"film can take any liberty needed to tell its story\\". Agreed, but this sort of film seems married to technical accuracy, indeed prides itself on it, and it felt strange to see so many lives risked, American and Iraqi, by hotshot tactics based on the need for a thrill. Is this what it's really like? Army guys risk each other's lives all the time just to cop a rush? The little speech about that was one of the few times this film really gripped me, much more than the many isn't-this-a-tense-moment scenes, which wore on far too long. They felt overdone and trite, in fact.<br /><br />One thing that others liked, THL's apparently opjective tone, felt off to me. Yes, this is how these guys do this job (or is it? The EOD reviewers giving this low stars say it ain't, and they might know best). But this job only occurs when we decide to send our troops to other countries, and some of the people there don't want us around. Examining the details of defusing bombs while ignoring the reasons for those bombs being made seems somehow dishonest in a way. You can't separate those details any more than you can separate a cow's role in a hamburger, and completely ignoring why we're in Iraq felt forced and fake in spite of all the attempts to make this seem real.<br /><br />Maybe that's why this movie is so beloved; it absolves the viewer from thinking about the subtle issues in Iraq, and focuses on the life or death moments, stripped of the entire context for their coming into being. It's much easier for us to see Iraq as a job for our soldiers than ask ourselves: if we really love these soldiers, why are we putting them in the line of death every day, and what have we gained from their sacrifices? Instead we get a film that makes all that seem extraneous.<br /><br />You're telling me these disposal guys never discuss the reasons for their being there? I don't buy that. I felt more for the innocent Iraqi strapped with a bomb than I did for the guys trying to defuse it. They volunteered for this, and are getting paid for their service; no one made them enlist---the draft is long gone. Whereas the Iraqi is just dying for no reason at all. So who's the hero? One of the basic points of a good war film is that it's not whose side you're on that makes you a good guy; it's whether you are a good person, apart from your country's motives. This was touched on to some degree here, but ignoring all the War On Terror context didn't make sense to me, and made this film feel contrived in many ways.<br /><br />The low-starred reviews here tend to be from military personnel, and their thoughts are very interesting to read.<br /><br />Perhaps I need to watch Hurt Locker again. But on first viewing it just didn't grip me the way it did most everyone else. I wish it had! Apocalypse Now and a number of other war films are among my favorite movies, and I was hoping this one would be too. But there's not one character here that I really cared about, one way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films. I appreciated Bigelow's craft, but it didn't move me as it did others. Doesn't mean it ain't a great movie, just that it ain't my idea of a great movie.way or the other, compared to my feelings about those films.

B000QUCNP4|5.0|Zodiac is an excellent movie that is successful on many levels. First, it tells a true-life crime story about a sensational serial murderer that galvanized the public, and was ultimately never solved. Second, it tells how the author of the book upon which the film was based was caught up in trying to solve the case while working as a cartoonist at The San Francisco Chronicle. Third, it tells the devastating effect this had on him and his family, and also on the police and reporters and their families. Fourth, it questions the role of media in cases like this--does the press coverage reward the killers with fame and notoriety? Does the press help or hinder the police? Fifth, it shows the need for different police jurisdictions to collaborate and share information.<br /><br />To accomplish these various goals it had a tight ensemble cast led by Jake Gylenhaal as Robert Graysmith; with strong performances from Robert Downey Jr. as Paul Avery, a reprobate reporter; Mark Ruffalo as Dave Toschi, a police detective assigned to the case; Chloë Sevigny, as Graysmith's long suffering wife; Jimmi Simpson (Lyle the Intern on Letterman), as one of Zodiac's surviving victims; along with Anthony Edwards (ER), Dermot Mulroney (The Thing Called Love), James LeGros (Bad Girls), Candy Clark (American Graffiti), and John Carroll Lynch.<br /><br />Special effects were used unobtrusively to enhance the film without distracting from the story, for instance, when they were unable to film on a particular street in San Francisco, they filmed on a soundstage, but dropped the actual street in as background, blending it flawlessly. Another establishing shot shows the Transamerica Pyramid being built with time-lapse photography. Though some special effects were used, they never got in the way.<br /><br />The film had a very realistic look. Scenes in the Chronicle were exactly as I remembered the place. All the locations looked totally accurate. As the film was based on real events, there was meticulous attention to detail. Though the friendship between Paul Avery and Graysmith was fictionalized, there is a disclaimer that informs the viewer of that fact. From that I gathered that most of the other details, the ones that pertained to the Zodiac murders, were very accurate. This is so important in this sort of true crime story because  a man is being accused of murder. The filmmakers are presenting a case, though largely circumstantial, that a man is guilty of multiple murders. The temptation for the filmmakers is to fabricate evidence, in the name of poetic license, or just to make a more compelling film. All the loose ends must be tied up before we can roll credits.<br /><br />------------------------------<br />Robert Graysmith: Just because you can't prove it doesn't mean it isn't true.<br />Dave Toschi: Easy, Dirty Harry.<br />==============<br /><br />Graysmith also wrote a book about the unsolved murder of Robert Crane. That book was also made into a movie--called Auto Focus, and directed by Paul Schrader. That book also presented a suspect that the author believed had done the crime, though in the case of Robert Crane there was finally a trial where the man Graysmith suspected was charged. After so many years, it was hard to find evidence or credible witnesses. He was found not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. As for Zodiac, you'll just have to watch the film, as I am not about to spoil the film by revealing the ending.<br /><br />The bottom line is Zodiac was a very good film that accomplished what it set out to do. It didn't dwell on the violence, but showed just enough to tell the story. It presented a very solid case for the identity of Zodiac, but didn't seem to manufacture evidence out of whole cloth. The story was just as much about what Graysmith, the reporters, and the police went through to keep their families together and not go insane as it was about the puzzle of solving a murder mystery. It also raised provocative questions about therole of media in reporting crimes. That it managed to do all this wisely and fairly and still be entertaining is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />-------------------<br />Robert Graysmith: I... I Need to know who he is. I...

B002BFBAUG|4.0|3.7 stars<br /><br />Very pleasant, occasionally quite funny, and with more smarts than its typical coming of age brethren, Adventureland is a good one for teens and anyone who longs for those times, or the mid-80s (as if we thought that was possible back then!).<br /><br />I related to a fair bit of this, as I also got out of high school at that time. The Madonna fashions, big hair, etc. are a time trip, but what makes this worth watching is a good, believable script and solid performances from all of the principles. This has cult written all over it. It's also full of funny cigarettes, so parents beware: this could be the gateway movie that ruins your childrens' lives completely.<br /><br />Bill Hader takes a nice cameo, but Wiig is woefully underused; she's the funniest comedienne out there, Hollywood: give her more to do!

0812973992|5.0|I was given this book from a dear friend of mine and did not know what to expect. I almost stopped reading this book half way through it but I am glad I finished it.  I grew up in NYC in the 1970's and many descriptions of what was going on in the City are accurate.  I was lucky enough to see Philippe Petit walk the tighrope that day. The first half of the book describes the underbelly of the City and many of the bottom of the barrel characters, prostitutes, drug dealers, street hustlers, etc.  In my view the book slowly turns into a modern day version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\".  The title of my review is from page 339.  If we reflect on our life how many unopened envelopes does each of us have and if they were opened where would it have led to and how different would our lives have been.  I will not high brow this nor summarize the book, many others have done it before me.  This is a highly recommended book and make sure to read slowly and savor the last third of the book.

The stories are good if slight and I would only recommend the book for devoted Harry Potter fans.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Quentin Tarantino isn't high on my list of directors.  I've always had a difficult time watching most of  his films, losing myself somewhere in the gore and inaneness.<br />Inglourious Basterds changed my perception of Tarantino as a director. I found the movie visually appealing and the story line  believable.  The Basterds brought to mind The Dirty Dozen on steroids with severe anger management issues but,as we all know, war is ugly.<br />Tarantino film displays this ugliness with a talented ease that was both graphic and detailed.  Pitt portrayal of LT. Aldo Raine, with his snide and cutting commentaries and his basic he** with the rules theories, is excellent.  Christopher Waltz as Col. Hans Landa made my skin crawl from his first appearance, stealthy and as cunning as a snake, all while he mentally examines his victims for weak spots.<br />All and all, if you can handle the gore, this is a fantastic movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B001G55JEK|4.0|It is difficult to judge a film that was developed in 1922 without understanding the evolution of film-making. Therefore, when viewing this film it is easy to make a judgement that the techniques are primitive, which they were by today's incredible film-making standards and technologies. It is as a historic work that this film is most interesting and should be judged since the story line is greatly simplified and the acting style of all the actors is over the top, which would make sense for a silent film. That being said, there are some haunting subtle images in the film such as the images of the dark ocean as Nosferatu travels from Translyvania to Germany. There are some images that are also striking in their simplicity, such as shadows of Nosferatu creping closer to victims. I found the film interesting and relatively fast moving since it is only one hour long.
0711986746|4.0|I must admit first off that I am not a die-hard Freddie or Queen fan. I do, however, really enjoy his work and the music he produced. I was looking for a book that provided a more insightful glimpse into Freddie's life to better understand the man behind the music. Although this book does not contain information on Freddie's early years, it does give a very rare glimpse into the last 12 years of his life as seen through the eyes of Peter Freestone (Freddie's personal assistant). Some of the details (very detailed description of Freddie's home in London) went on for a bit too long, but the rest of the book was tolerable. The book also contains a few pages filled with photos from Peter's personal album.  I would highly recommend reading it.

0553208845|5.0|Well, what hasn't been said. I'll just say I hit the public library a lot and this is one of those books that reminds me of the bible, but in a novel and one that takes a story to tell a message of enlightenment. But it's more than that. It's a story of self discovery, stories really. If you can read into them they are reflective of our everyday lives. After finishing this book I found myself coming back to it over and over within the course of a year to reread certain passages and words of Siddhartha. Sort of like words of enlightenment. being a Christian, i found this helpful in my everyday battle with self awareness of the spirit and mind. to put it simply, as a new dad, one of those books I will want my daughter to read when it is time. Simply beautiful and a book that left me at peace when i was done and still makes me smile.

1591841992|3.0|The text is awesome, and the explanations are very clear. However, there too many letters and too few graphics to support the \\"visual thinking\\" issue, which is supposed to be the \\"soul\\" of the book.    Another little \\"complaint\\": the main part of the drawings and graphics are too small. It is sometimes very difficult to see them without phisically getting nearer to the pages.    As a final comment: the idea is fantastic, and the development the author carries out is simply REMARKABLE. In my opinion, if the author raises the number of drawings/graphics and makes them bigger, the book would be sincerely UNBEATABLE (I would buy the new and augmented edition ¡¡¡)

0312360266|5.0|Marked, the House of  Night, was a book that I almost passed over in the book store. To say that I am sick of vampire stories is a huge understatement. Once I read the first two pages of Marked, I was absolutely hooked. The book centers around 16 year old Zoey Redbird who finds herself being marked as a vampire in the hallway of her high school. Once you are \\"marked\\" there is a crescent moon shape on your forehead which signifies that you are beginning the process of becoming a vampire. To continue the process, Zoey must immediately pack up her belongings and head to the House of Night, a vampire boarding school which focuses on vampire education and experiences. Once Zoey arrives at the House of Night she meets her country bumpkin roommate, Stevie Rae, who quickly becomes Zoey's sidekick. Zoey soon discovers that she is one of the most powerful fledgling vampires and that she has a strong connection to the goddess, Nyx. As Zoey struggles to adjust to her new life she learns to embrace the powers that were given to her. What is great about Marked is that it is a different take on vampires. The authors inject a lot of humor into the situation as well as drama and darkness. There are so many wonderful characters such as Zoey's grandmother who shows her the unconditional love that Zoey's own mother never shows her. Despite the fact that I am a full grown adult, I loved the adventures of a 16 year old Zoey. I am  now reading the fourth book in the series.  Don't pass this book up. It is a gem and highly addictive. Enjoy.
B00280LYIC|3.0|After watching the trailer for the upcoming movie adapted from this book, my husband and I decided to read it together for fun. Although we knew it wouldn't be literary genius (it is a teens/children's book after all), we figured it would at least be entertaining. And it was, for a while, until the last half of the book slid into some cheesy and predictable territory. We found ourselves rolling our eyes through most of it and were both able to figure out who the betraying friend would be almost as soon as the prophecy was made. What we were hoping for was another Harry Potter, but I'm afraid Percy Jackson is just a shadow of his wizarding boy-hero predecessor. That said, I am sure that this story would have great appeal to its intended audience, which is why I'm giving it three stars. We will definitely give the second book a try to see if the story improves.
B000BB14YY|5.0|I was just browsing around Amazon and saw that this version of Ran had finally been discontinued. I was thinking about writing something after seeing Lionsgate was publishing the Blu Ray after the problems last year. In all my DVD ownership I've owned every version of Ran from the non-anamorphic Fox Lorber, to the botched Masterworks, and Criterions usual superlative double disc edition. The Blu has a good list of features but nothing as packed as the Criterion DVD.<br />The film itself is one I'd consider my favorite film of all time. I saw it fifteen years ago aand could get behind the epic nature of the warfare and violence. Every time since then its one of those films that reveals a different thing that I'm amazed about. If you somehow have never heard of Ran, know the main thing is the movie is an adaptation of King Lear as a feudal samurai drama. Hidetora has decided to live out his life under the care of his sons, one of whom He makes warlord. Upon the news one son insults him telling him the honest truth and is banished for his efforts. To make it simple the wife of one son is part of a family who was conquered by Hidetora and sets out to turn the family against each other. Hidetora seeking to maintain some type honor retreats to a castle where the remaining sons attack his entourage and He goes insane being rescued in a field by a loyal vassal and the Japanese version of a jester in Kyoami and theres more.<br />Outside of the story everything in the movie is perfect to me from Kurosawas staging that reminded me at times of a more play-like presentation (especially in the famous castle burning scene where a mad Hidetora marches out on castle steps with two types of warriors parting, something in the scene reminded me old Met operas that were broadcast on Public television). Kurosawa also scored big in the casting with Mieko Harada being the main choice as Lady Kaede who uses her sexuality to gain the upperhand against men. My favorite character though is Kurogane played by Hisashi Igawa who starred in the remaining Kurosawa films. Here Kurogane is the type of character Toshiro Mifue would have played- not to take anything away from Igawa. The character is a loyal soldier, second in command who finds himself at odds with Lady Kaede. He supports Lord Jiro in his betrayl of Hidetora but as Jiro pulls away from his leadership He finds himself sabbotaging Kaede's efforts. Basically He's struggling to be honorable to his leader, and He does get the best scene in the movie. When you see it you'll know what I'm talking about.<br />Like I said the Criterion so far has been the best version of the film. The image was greatly improved over the Masterworks edition which also had a problem with the audio. But the features were stacked with an inciteful commentary from Stephen Prince, a video interview with Sidney Lumet and all of the trailers for the film on the first disc. The second has the bounty of the disc starting with A.K. a documentary on the making of the film (its on the Blu). Theres also the usual It is Wonderful to Create program that comes with almost all of the Kurosawa films, this one focusing on the making of the film, a piece Ran through artwork done by Kurosawa and a video interview with Tatsuya Nakadai. And as usual theres the Criterion inclusion of an extensive booklet.<br />Anyway this is the definitive version of a true film masterpiece. And I love the film so much its inclusion to Blu-Ray is enough to make me finally upgrade to the format (fourth time for the movie) even if Criterion made the more superior product.layed by Hisashi Igawa who starred in the remaining Kurosawa films.

B000FC1RCI|4.0|I just received my Kindle for Christmas, and was sent on a mystery-reading frenzy sparked by the recent Sherlock Holmes movie. I started with the Holmes stories, and have made my way to Agatha Christie, whose books I have never read. The first I downloaded was And Then There Was None. I started reading it late last night and immediately continued this morning. Since my husband was out running errands, I found myself in the house alone right when the book was reaching its climax. I was so scared that every little noise in the house made me jump. I was quite literally on the edge of my seat! I have to say that it's probably the first time that a book has made me react in such a way. I cannot wait to read more, and will hopefully be diving into the Miss Marple series next. So, in short, this was a great afternoon read for any mystery lover!

B001TH8UUA|5.0|I bought this cable to work with my samsung tv and home theater system.  The box says it complies with HDMI 1.3b.  HDMI 1.2 and 1.3 provide conformance to the requirements for CEC.  Other, more expensive cables are NOT worth the money, check out Samsung's website or CNET if you do not believe all of the comments posted here.  Installation of the cable was easy but had problems obtaining full CEC capacities. After hours on the internet I found that unplugging both the TV and the home theater for ten seconds fixed the problem.  I now have full CEC capacities.

While the 3D process is anaglyphic for home viewing instead of RealD, this is still quite effective and you will find yourself ducking out of the way as various objects are hurled at you.  The 2D version looks incredible and the soundtrack is powerful and very good indeed.  The movie is pretty basic FINAL DESTINATION stuff but does manage to work up some suspense in a couple of scenes, in particular the beauty salon sequence.  The cast is attractive and does a great job with the material and the film moves at a brisk pace.  The disc includes several short deleted scenes and some standard making of documentary material.  All in all, this is a good disc and a good movie.  I had a great time with it.

0316044938|1.0|The beginning was catchy. It's the reason I was debating between one stars and two stars. (As you can see, I finally went with one.) I admit, I thought I was falling in love with the novel. I was ready to neglect the fact that Susie, a fourteen year old, sounded as mature and educated as a woman who'd just graduated from college and was aiming for a Master's. Turns out, I couldn't. She was too grown up for her age; she didn't sound like a teenager at all, and I hated that. I couldn't fathom how smart Susie sounded, because if she was such a genius, why the heck would she be interested in a house that was practically inside a hole? (Or something like that.)    As I kept reading, more things started to irritate me. Like the sloppy order, for instance. Susie jumps from her life in heaven, to her past, to her present, and back to the past again. She'll be telling the story of her rape one minute and about how different life on heaven is the next. She'll be talking about Lindsey in her teenage days and then go back to the days before her own death. The constant flashbacks annoyed me. I'm not saying chronological order is what works best, because there are books that go backwards (Rewind by Laura Dower) that really work, but this novel here? It makes the corners of my mouth twitch--and not like I'm about to smile, either.    I hate the injustice of the situation. Not only does the murderer get away with all the crimes he's committed in the previous years, but he dies in an accident. Accident. It's like saying he didn't deserve to die; he was merely in the wrong place at the wrong time. Of course, others would argue that it's just karma kicking some ass. Nonetheless, I wished he could have been caught. I expected him to get caught. I wanted Susie's body to be found, but no, the author had to torture the parents and her readers with just discovering a piece of her charm bracelet. Certainly, this moment points out the harsh realty: it's not uncommon for bodies to never be uncovered in a homicide, but this is a story. I want my dose of justice. I'm not even being conservative when I say I want good to triumph bad. It's just how it is: good vs. evil and good wins. Not in this book, not in that sense. The murder doesn't even have to go to jail. He doesn't even have to repent. (I'm not optimistic to believe that all criminals see the error of their murderous ways, but I expected it from a book!) He just dies. For a man who's raped and killed on more than one occasion, I'd liked to see something happen to him that doesn't result in the word \\"accident\\" being used.    I hated the portrayal of the mother. I never understood that photograph, but then again, I was never compelled to re-read that nauseatingly long passage with descriptions about her eyes that didn't particularly make sense and sounded lame anyway. Apparently, that picture was important because it showed a hidden side to her mother that the girls knew nothing about. And apparently, it explained why the mother needed to commit adultery of (with the police man, of all people!) and then run away when the going got tough. She's a real role model, girls. Anyway. I just don't think it's a very honest account of something that could happen. She might have felt suppressed before Susie's death, but wouldn't losing one daughter remind her that she didn't want to lose another? So where's the logic if she runs away? No logic, I tell you. Also, I just thought the adultery bits were disgusting. It wasn't the idea itself, but that Susie was watching them. Who the heck does that? And it was completely uncalled for when Susie said she understood why her mother did what she did. Given the situation, dead or alive, I would have panicked, screamed, and rat her out on the spot. I wouldn't be able to comprehend anything like Susie did. The ill-logic and outrageousness of the situation just completely baffled me. But, my ranting doesn't just end here. There's also the complete lack of depth in this character. I never understood why she did what she did, or what she thought at all. She just \\"looked\\" lost in that photograph and apparently, was suffocating by being a housewife all this time. Great. Where's the explanation?    Quite unexpectedly, I've formed a love-hate relationship with the father. I truly admired his determination and his \\"gut instinct\\" that led him to believe who the killer was. (At this point in my review, I have already forgotten the neighbor's name.) I was proud of the father figure that was willing to sacrifice everything so his deceased daughter could obtain peace and justice in heaven. At the same time, however, it was that determination that drove me insane. He was too stubborn for his own good. Furthermore, spying on the neighbor didn't get him anywhere. It just got on the police's nerves and turned his wife away. At points, it frustrated me that he was so oblivious to the real world and that his family needed him, instead focusing his attention of proving that his suspect was guilty. And in the end, while everyone believed him now, he'd lost things. Like his wife. I hated how dependent he became on her, to the point where he didn't care that she'd cheated on him and even confirmed that he was falling in love with her all over again. You'd be surprise how much cringing that moment took from me.    There was no plot. At first, I thought the story would be about how Susie \\"helped\\" the people on Earth find alarming clues that would lead to the arrest of her murderer, but that didn't happen. So then, I thought it would be about life on heaven. But that didn't happen either. Instead, it was just a long account of what Susie saw of her family and friends while she was in heaven. BORING. Things happened, but nothing really happened. There wasn't one greater conflict that strung everyone together. There really wasn't a resolution. There really wasn't a story. It was more about emotions. And life. Together, it just made up a really long novel that seemed to be about everything but truly, was about very little.    Ray, Ray, Ray. How to say this? Completely UNREALISTIC! He does not think about Susie every day for the rest of his life since their first kiss. He shouldn't be that much in love with the girl in the first place. It just doesn't happen. They were fourteen, for God's sake! How much love and raw emotion do you expect? But, it was more of an agonizing torture and shock when they had sex when Susie was in Ruth's body. First of all, HOW does that even happen? Second, WHY would he even believe something like that could happen? And third, WHO even screws (excuse me for being blunt) with another girl while she is trapped in another's body? That was simply revolting. And Ruth let her? I wanted to vomit. Not amount of \\"ghost-sighting\\" will make me give up my body to a ghost so she can have intercourse with a boy in my body. The situation is so wrong that no amount of fancy words and feelings can turn it into acceptance. Excuse me while I go and gag some more at this atrocity.    Let me just say that before this book, I've been adequate at book skimming. Post-The-Lovely-Bones however, I'm a certified professional at skimming. I'm being honest when I say I read word for word in the beginning. But towards the middle and the end, I'd mastered the art of skipping through lengthy passages filled with irrelevant descriptions. It was such nonsense to read through repetitive emotional scenes that I've encountered pages before this. Basically, by the time you get to the middle, everything is expected and familiar. Nothing new happens. You already know the gist of things. You're just waiting for the author and the protagonist to figure that out. And when they don't, you'll have to tag along for a long ride that does not guarantee full refund. Well, unless you're smart and you escaped earlier in the novel. Then, congratulations.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Like all Trekkies, I couldn't wait to see this latest version of the saga. While I was in the theatre, I couldn't wait to get out. Did the writers ever see Star Trek before, or at all? Pike was Kirk's captain, but did not get injured the way it was portrayed (BEEP-BEEP). Secondly, the crew did not come together for some time (McCoy & Chekov were not part of the original crew). MOST of all, Kirk did NOT start his Star Fleet assignment on the Enterprise. You can try to wuss it away by using timeline excuses, but it doesn't wash. Even the Romulans looked like something from the Road Warrior rather than Romulus. On its own, as a sci-fi movie, it was enjoyable and could stand on its own, but as a \\"continuation\\" (pre-quel), it falls flat. Resistance is not futile! I got the same reaction from hundreds leaving the theatre. I guess you'll have to make up your own mind (pun intended). Live long and prosper; \\"To thine own self be true\\"!
1595141715|3.0|If you think this is anything like Looking for Alaska, you're wrong. Okay, so the basic suicide issue still remains, complete with a protagonist who's somehow involved (more romantically than not) with the girl who committed suicide, but that's about it. If you think you're going to get a character as intriguing and genuine as John Greene's, think again. Clay Jensen is a good boy, but man, he is such a whiner: \\"Why am I even on this tape? I didn't do anything to Hannah Baker? Why am I on this tape? Somebody tell me!\\" Yup. That's the basic gist of it. Well, Clay Jensen: why don't you just stop complaining and listen to the tapes already? And if you think Hannah is anything like Alaska, well, ditto. The entire time, I kept screaming: \\"You committed suicide because of this??! You might as well be the walking definition of succumbing to bullying! Where's your girl power? Where's your sense of taking down high school?\\"    Yes, I have this weird habit of talking back to characters that annoy the heck out of me. You have no idea how many \\"paper-stupid\\" characters I encounter monthly, where I want nothing but to scream and bite their heads off for being so inconveniently stupid. Excuse my violent tendencies if you will; I am not like this in real life at all. Only towards fiction. (And I do know that one cannot \\"destroy\\" high school hierarchy, only choose to be completely ignorant of its existence.).    So. While I liked the premise, I did not like the execution of the story or the characters. But really, it's not just because they don't match up to John Greene's. It's because Clay and the others who contributed to the 13 reasons Hannah killed herself were just annoying. Why did Hannah feel the need to send out those cassettes? Obviously, she wanted some sort of revenge, even though she repeatedly tells people that she's on the verge of forgiveness and that she knows it's not their fault? Oh yeah, you are sure showing that forgiveness the right way: by trying to tear into everyone's guilt, even when some had no idea they'd done something wrong. I mean, come on. Is it that realistic? This is high school we're talking about. Heck, drama happens everywhere, from the start of elementary school to whatever nursing home your grandchildren will put you through. Bitchy things are said to another a hundred times an hour. Do we have ESP? Are we supposed to know that our comment will contribute to one of the reasons why someone decided to commit suicide? I just think Hannah's ulterior motive is never explained, or if it can be guessed, then it's a disoriented guess. Do the reasons she states not seem superficial and juvenile or what? Like with the first guy, Justin. What did you think was going to happen after you kissed him? Of course he's going to tell people. Of course he's going to brag. It's human nature. Are you going to get all hypocritical about human behavior when you're most likely to brag about doing things with your boyfriend at a slumber party?    Ah, the ending. This is the part where the author tries to stick some morals up our nose. After all, Clay makes a point of talking to an outsider, so we led to presume that we must talk to \\"losers\\" to avoid another suicide from happening. WRONG. The execution of this message should have been neater. Talking will not help. (Okay, it will, but come on, that drastically?) How about going after the people \\"connected\\" to Hannah's suicide? Or, I guess if you don't like revenge (or the idea that revenge backfires, which totally does happen) at least make it less cheesy than ending the book with the guy running after a girl to talk. It just seems completely random.    And I would think that Clay would destroy the cassettes. I didn't think he was going to keep passing them around, because honestly, the right thing to do would be to take the tapes to the police. I mean, a guy raped a girl, and the witness is on tape. Aren't you at least going to trial the guy for rape? What kind of atrocity is this?You don't just keep on pretending nothing has happened with all this information you know. It's just not right. So there is it, the single most annoying thing I have ever read. The plot is totally unjustified.
B00005JNS0|1.0|Yes, your kid will be drawn to it like if he were hypnotized, and yes he will not blink for the entire duration of the film, and yes you will have some peace... momentarily.   But just wait... when he starts pushing everyone out of the way like if he were in a race car, imitating the bad guy of the story, when he talks back to you using words such as \\"moron\\" and \\"idiot\\", when he runs blindly running over everything in his path like a race car, and when his creativity is null, only playing to repeat the movie, finding all other forms of play unappealing, and when he throws tantrums because he wants to see this film over and over and over and over like if there were nothing else in life, you will want to throw this movie as far far far away as you can, and as I did.
014241493X|4.0|Let's just say that if you're feeling down or wanting to get all critically philosophical on life, this book is for you. Identity, adventure, friendship, romance, and intellectual conversations--it's all in here. Forget Looking for Alaska because Green's latest is much better.    I loved the protagonist. Such a romantic, such a dreamer. I wish everyone could see the world for its simplicity instead of its complexity, like Margo did the latter. But I realize that the world's too messed-up for anyone, except innocent kids (even they are becoming not-so-innocent at tender ages), to see it as the absolute picture of life.    Despite being brutally honest in Margo's perception of herself and the people around her, she was truly awkward in both her actions and language. A girl who was as interested in profound poetry would have had a clearer \\"thinking\\" head than to spit out phrases that didn't resemble her collectiveness and controlled manner as a character. She was the \\"enigma\\" of the story, but I always knew she was the attention addict who soaked it up like a sponge did to water; and frankly, I thought she tried too hard. She had moments that made me roll my eyes at her \\"mysterious\\" gestures.    While I enjoyed reading and laughing and thinking with my critical eye, I wasn't too pleased with the pace. Let's just say some parts were so excruciatingly long that I wondered whether I'd finish the book any time soon. I just felt like the clues were too forced and scattered to make sense to anyone (mostly, me) but when pieced together in the final round, I was just glad they could hop into the truck and find Margo already. By the time they reached her, I felt like strangling Margo myself for making the journey so complicated and being such an a-hole to them. Being an essential part of the story and all, she basically ruined it for me. However, I won't forget that confrontation with Q at the end. Such an honest look on oneself. If we could all see ourselves for the person weare instead of the person we try to be . . . well, we'd all be in a better place.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|This movie is not as good as the other Harry Potter movies. It did not seem to have a major plot to it nor did it seem to connect from the beggining to the end. It could have been more detailed in the plot. If you are a true Harry fan like my family, you will buy it and watch, no matter what. For the price I paid, I do feel I got my money's worth.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I ordered these based on the great reviews, and I wasn't disappointed.  These are made out of plastic that looks and feels just like the plastic on the stock controller buttons.  They snapped on perfectly the first time, and don't come off unless you drop the controller and it lands right on one.  The plastic is thick and virtually unbreakable.  I couldn't ask for more for the price.  In a time where so often products disappoint, it was a real pleasure to get something that does what it is supposed to do and at a low price.  On top of all that, it gives great accuracy and keeps fingers from slipping off during a sweaty tense situation.  This is especially good during some of the FPS games I play where you are holding down like 5 different buttons and having to hold them to keep from falling off a building or something of that nature.  You can't go wrong with these!<br /><br />- Durable construction<br />- Matching color<br />- Easy, solid attachment<br />- Keeps fingers on the buttons
B000LB7G00|5.0|Purchased Space Navigator through Amazon and use it daily with Blender 3D and Adobe Inventor.  If you use hotkeys for 3D modeling routines (and you should), you need this.  Even if just used for simple rotation, translation and scaling, it is a time saver.  I use it in addition to a digital tablet.  It is not replacement for a mouse but will increase your productivity by concentrating a bunch of functions into one device.  Pros:  Big time saver (after you get used to it).  Did not slow my computer (with Inventor and Blender and Google Earth).  Excellent customer service - failed unit was quickly replaced, no questions asked.  Cons:   Heavy if you carry it around in a bag with other items (like a digital tablet).    A little fragile - mine failed after about 5 months possibly from note being stored in a case.  I now store mine in the plastic bubble case it came in.  Make sure that the application you want to use it with has a driver, some are not supported (POVRay, Rhino3d).
B001U6YI92|2.0|Short Version of My Review:  MOVIE - 5 Stars  Blu Ray - 1 Star    I have seen this movie MANY, MANY times, and it is one of my favorites!  I grew up watching this movie; first during a TV broadcast, and then many times off of a VHS recording of the broadcast.  A few years ago I bought the DVD, but because I can't find it, I bought the blu ray version.    Because I have seen this movie so many times, I can remember almost every sound effect and every line of dialog.  Because I had watched this movie over and over on a 19\\" tv with the audio playing out of the tv's tiny speakers, I looked forward to watching this movie on my modern home theater setup with all of the great music in the soundtrack and great dialog of the script!    Despite a review I had read discussing the shortcomings of the provided soundtracks, I bought the disc...I guess I was just jonesing to watch blondie and tuco!  I am sad to say the review I read was dead-on and I reiterate their sentiments...the audio options are horrible!!!!  There is an English DTS HD track, English mono, Spanish 5.1, French 5.1, Portuguese 5.1, German 5.1, and the original Italian mono track.  So many tracks, none of them what I want!!!!!  Each of the English tracks substitutes these ridiculous generic gun and cannon fire sound effects for the original sound effects.  Every time they shoot, instead of hearing the authentic sound effects, you hear a cheesy 80's TV cop show gunshot sound effect.  It is so annoying!!!  How hard would it have been to get an old gun, get some bullets, shoot it, and record the sound?!?!?!?!  Imagine watching Top Gun, and whenever there was a scene with jets, they played car engine sounds!  Wouldn't that be ridiculous?  Well, it's almost as bad as that would be.  And the rest...well...they aren't in English!!!!  I found myself watching the movie with remote in hand, constantly switching from an English track to hear the dialog I know and love, and then switching to the Italian track to hear the original gunfire sound effects whenever there was shooting (which is quite often!).    Okay, okay...my grandmother is from Mexico so on the odd chance that she comes over and randomly wants to watch this movie, the Spanish track will come in handy.  But adding a French, Portuguese, German, and Italian track but not the original English track...C'MON!!!!!!!    I would have been very happy watching this movie on blu ray with the original English mono track converted to 5Ch or even 2Ch stereo by my receiver.  But instead I have this crappy disc with it's crappy options!    Unfortunately this movie isn't the only movie where the wrong sound effects are used.  One that stands out in my mind is the Italian Job, where when the guy rides up on a Ducati, they use the sound effect from a 4 cylinder bike.  The sound of a Ducati is unmistakable!  I would let it slide if they had used the sound from another V-twin bike, but a 4 cylinder?  Are they that clueless?  Oh yeah, the same thing happens in Transformers, the dude rides an Aprilia Mille (another v-twin) yet it sounds like a 4 cylinder bike.  I guess somewhere on a computer they have a \\"motorcycle\\" sound effect recorded and they use it for all motorcycles.  It must be the same computer where the \\"gun\\" sound effects they used to make this blu ray are stored!!!!  Maybe someday they will hire actual knowledgeable human beings to do sound effects for movies and not just some clueless monkeys!!!  Maybe they can expand their portfolios not to just include \\"gun\\" sounds, but maybe even \\".44 magnum\\" and \\"9mm semiauto\\" and \\"m4\\" sounds!!!!  I can only hope, until that day you can be assured that there is someone somewhere shaking his head in disbelief or even pulling out his hair out of frustration because Hollywood didn't do their research.  Damn you, soundtrack guys!!!!!!
B002S8AH00|5.0|OK, first of all I want to start with this: This movie is one of my all time favorite movies. PERIOD. So five stars is what it gets even with the complaint I am about to mention. Julia, Heath, heck everyone is perfectly cast, and writing and directing are perfection. Music = Genius. All that said I already had this DVD since day one of the original release. But I prayed for a Criterion release, unrealistic though that was, or OK, so maybe just a \\"Special Edition\\" with deleted scenes and a making of feature. Along comes this new 10th Anniversary release announcement and I am beyond excited. Jump to now... sigh.... \\"Making of\\" featurette: CHECK. Deleted scenes: huh? Where? No? arrgghhhh!!!!! I searched everywhere. Every menu. Not even an \\"easter egg\\" to be found. So I come here and see a recent review pointing out that the \\"deleted scenes\\" were actually part of the \\"making of\\" featurette!!! So actual full on deleted scenes, maybe even with director's commentary?: NEGATIVE!!! To paraphrase Yoda: feeling ripped off beyond belief I am. So great movie and a load of horse hockey for extras as listed. Again... sigh...
0689865384|4.0|This is one of those books that I have kept putting off reading, and now that I've read it, I have no idea why it took me so long! The one good thing about putting it off is that the series has all been released already. I don't have to wait for the next one!<br /><br />They are YA Science Fiction and I swear that I think every teenager should be required to read these books! They are set in our world, but about 300 years in the future. The characters live in a society where you are either an ugly or a pretty. Uglies are normal people, mostly kids, and when you turn 16 you get MAJOR reconstructive surgery to be the ideal pretty. The main character, Tally, meets a girl named Shay. They are just about 3 months from their 16 birthdays and Tally is just counting down the days until she can become pretty. But Shay has a different perspective on things. She likes the way that she looks right now. Why does she have to have surgery to become pretty?<br /><br />This series really delves into issues that face all of us every day. It did take a little bit for me to get into this book, and that's the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  But once I did it just grabs you and holds on until the last page. Then once you've read that last page you have to race out and get the next one!<br /><br />As a side note, for those of you who enjoy audiobooks, this was a great one. Some of the voices that the reader used for some characters took me a bit to get used to, but it was overall a great audio book series!
B001UV4XUQ|4.0|It's hard for me to see through the rose-tinted glasses of Zooey Deschanel, her beauty, and the eloquence of her voice; Joseph Gordon-Levitt is also a solid actor.  This movie had some well executed designs; jumping back and forth through 500 days of a relationship was artfully done, hooking me without utterly confusing me, as can often happen. There's a dance scene of Gordon-Levitt's that's just priceless; Zooey sings and--as always--my heart melts.<br /><br />I like this movie, don't get me wrong, but I don't LOVE this movie, and it's not because it's not the ending the audience typically wants. Minka Kelly is no booby prize; I'd quickly embrace her if scorned by Deschanel, and go on to live a long and happy lifestyle of frolicking through IKEA stores.  It's hard to point out the gap between me liking this movie and me loving it, and in the end comes down to individual interpretations of aesthetic qualities.<br /><br />But it's a hilarious movie--at times I knew the witticisms couldn't be more spot on; it's an emotional movie--at times the romance is so potent my eyes water.  Worth a watch definitely, just don't expect it to be your average romantic comedy.
B003204MQS|2.0|If you did not like 'The Blair Witch Project' you probably will not like this one either. It's an agonizingly slow burning candle if, like me, you're an empiricist and don't believe one iota in an unverifiable supernatural world. In fact it will quickly seem contrived and quite silly. In fact, the relationship between the two principals was more interesting than all the boogieman stuff. Their 'partnership' was downright annoying. It struck me as uncomfortably modern, without real affection and fraught with the certainty of future dysfunctionality. You will probably hate yourself the morning-after if you spend money to watch this decidedly unscary effort.  Lary9
0307454541|5.0|This novel is really three stories about two people who are connected in the most dramatic way.  We start with a journalist who is fed misinformation so that he will destroy his own credibility.  We have a heroine who is the most unlikely (and unlikable) person in modern literature.  He can be naive in the ways of the non- literati world, while she wants nothing to do with the 'real' world and enjoys spending all of her time in the Web.<br /><br />Three mysteries are brought together under one roof when the journalist is hired by the head of a well known industrial family.  Under the cover of writing a family biography (Mikael Blomkvist) is asked to look into the disappearance of a sixteen year old girl in 1966.  It's a type of 'locked room' mystery but brilliantly presented by Larsson.  The second mystery is who has been sending him a birthday a very specific type of present every year for the last forty-two years.  The third mystery is related to Mikael and how he got into his problem in the first place.  In addition there are some great sidelights of how to get revenge without getting caught.<br /><br />Larsson originally titled the book, \\"Men who Hate Woman\\" and this gives the book it's 'raison d'etre' but doesn't seem as interesting as the current one.  The book is a very modern take on the Swedish community and how it relates to modern Europe.  The polemic of the book deals with the ongoing violence against women in Sweden that seems to be ignored like the proverbial elephant in the closet.  The drinking problems in the Scandinavian countries are well documented but the total unconcern related to domestic violence is eye opening.<br /><br />The eponymous young lady's story is a polemic on how the 'cradle to grave' society of Sweden doesn't always protect those that need to be protected, nor catch those 'aberrant' personalities if they have money.  Some of this will seem familiar to readers of Henning Mankell, Jo Nesbo and Helen Tursten.  There is even a 'red herring' dealing with the support for Nazism in Sweden during the second world war (which Larsson doesn't follow up on).<br /><br />This is not just a mystery/thriller/ whatever, but an astonishingly literary novel. There are loads of referrals to other writers and Swedish contemporary politicians and television and news personalities.  Many kudos have to be given to Reg Keeland  (Steven T. Murray) for his translation.  I wonder how much better the translation has made this book or how much was lost.  When reading I never felt that I could be missing anything because the translation contains a fair amount of 'colloquialisms' that can't mean the same in Swedish or even have the same connotations.  It is though an 'English' translation and can therefore be confusing to some Americans who haven't read much contemporary English mysteries.<br /><br />Fabulous job.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitzhe support for Nazism in Sweden during the second world war (which Larsson doesn't follow up on).

B001AUEMFS|5.0|There's a reason this song was so popular.  Not only does it have an incredibly memorable melody, it also has some danged fine lyrics.  The song talks about being at the top of things and realizing what a weak foundation things were built on.  Great song!
B00275EGX8|3.0|I watched this wanting an experience like Black Hawk Down I didn't get that with this film. I don't know how or what would have salvaged the script it started out promising but to me quickly fell flat. For instance, fairly early on with the main character I didn't care if he got himself blown to bits or not and there was no one else to connect to. IMO it's watch able no question but I never got caught up in the story line or any of the characters so it's nothing I'm going to run out and buy.
1594481784|5.0|So I've been looking forward to reading the last chapter of Nick Hornby's brilliant novel all night. I read several pages after work in the parking lot of my office building but thought I'd save the last few pages for the couch, for tonight, for now.  I just realized that the copy I own is missing the second to last page!! Bloody hell! I got the copy from my neighbor's yard sale last year--it was 50 cents and I didn't check every page to make sure they were there--and I would go over and pound on their door begging for a refund or the missing page if they still lived there.     Anyone know of a pdf version floating around cyberspace? Don't know if I can hold off to go to my local library to check out the book. Pages 321 and 322 in the Riverhead Books paperback would be extremely helpful, the one with the day-glo orange cover. Or a scan of the last chapter that begins with, \\"Before the band comes on...\\"  would suffice. I'm gonna post this on IMDB and a Hornby fan's blog too.  Please reply here or at my own blog at [...].  Thanks and cheers. If you come through, I'll make you a mix tape.

Someone very close to me is in charge for Disney media marketing & distribution for the western half of the United States. This individual told me that they don't plan on releasing Finding Nemo till 2012.....so we all are gonna have to wait. I will tell you it might be worth the wait because this is truly one of the best disney movies!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I really like the way this study bible functions on my new Kindle.  Purchased it to use in a bible study class at my church.  Going to and from the notes is very easy.  Overall it is very easy to navigate.  As far as content goes I think it is a pretty standard study Bible.  With this class, this is the first time I have actually read the Bible.
1594488878|5.0|Hornby, as usual, does a superb job at mixing contemporary themes and the complexities of modern relationships.  He just gets 'it'.  This book is enjoyable from the first page to the last.  The audio recording is also a superb production.  You will find yourself googling Tucker Crow by the end of the book.  I loved it.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|I did like the movie however it wasn't as good as i expected. Even though it wasn't a 90 minute movie it still felt short; again they've turned a book into a movie and left out so much information and interesting parts that the readers expected. I still enjoyed the movie and I'm still a fan, especially when you see the actors grow mentally and physically in front of you. Maybe the problem is also that i feel it's taking so long to do all the stories, while reading them only takes a matter of weeks or months(depending on what kind of reader you are).Because I'm still a fan and i still liked the movie I give it 3.5 stars;higher if it were longer and truer to the book. Still watchable and worthy of adding to the collection.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|I loved the first two installments of The final destination movies. Possibly because when those came out I was a very young adult and more related to the actors maybe. I don't know but that's my theory. Also the first two movies seemed more plausible. Maybe. In the first movies death didn't \\"play\\" with you as much.They were simple and to the point. Now death seems to take it's time. It's like all your actions no matter how insignificant they are death will use them to work against you to kill you. Killing you in a weird, freakish way. Also the special effects looked very fake and cheesy. Overall , I still had fun watching it but I'll stick to the first two.
0316044938|4.0|I had very high expectations for this novel. They were mostly met except for the conclusion, but I'll get to that later.<br /><br />The entire novel was heartbreaking. I felt the pain of every single character and it tore me to pieces. Though the story is taking place through Susie's eyes, we only get to know her though other people and flashbacks. Every character dealt with the loss of Susie in very different ways. Kids of school gossiped, her Dad tried to make sense of it, her sister ignored everyone, and her mom tried to move on without letting it sink in.<br /><br />The whole concept of the novel was really amazing. To think that there is an \\"in between\\" place where you can watch your family and even have a little bit of contact is amazing. Every situation was heightened because we knew the dangers that were coming. We got the emotions of every character one at a time and Susie on top of everything. I have to admit, at times it became a little overwhelming.<br /><br />One of the most unexpected character for me to feel bad for was Susie's murderer. We got to see some of his past and get to know him as a person instead of just a killer. Of course I hate him still, but I don't see him as a cold hearted person.<br /><br />I expected the ending to be different. Of course there was no way for it to be entirely happy since Susie was still gone, but at least some emotional issues were resolved. Even as I finished the last page I wished that it was different. I wished that Susie could be alive. I wished for closure. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a bit of suspense and a good cry.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This was my favorite movie of the year and wasn't sure how much I would like it going in...saw it because I like the next gen show and movies.
1416914307|4.0|The third book to The Mortal Instruments Series definitely lived up to my expectations. For some reason the book made me feel all cozy inside knowing that the Downworlders and Shadowhunters were working togther against Valentine.<br /><br />But that is just about all the cozy there was. Just like in City of Ashes there is a lot of betrayal. To this day I pretty much hate the Clave. They seem totally power crazy and think they know how to handle everything by torturing people and putting them in jail. I mean poor Simon. He didn't even want to go to the City of Glass, and now is being punished for what he can not control. Another not about Simon, I'm glad he wasn't as whiny about Clary in this book. It was becoming a bit annoying.<br /><br />There was just so much information and action packed into this book I couldn't stop reading. I can't tell you much more because I might spoil some surprises and false identities....but I really liked this book. The ending was very well done and made sense. You know why everything happened and why. It was nice to get some sort of explanation to our unanswered questions. If you haven't checked out these books yet, you should!
B002WCLG48|5.0|Ok so I might not have the best title for this, but I for one can give at least a small reveiw for this in general because I've been watching these on Halo Waypoint.        Anyways Overall this may or may not add to halo ( Some fanboys get upset due to contradictions, while others (like myself) enjoy this for the addition to the halo universe).  As far as each invidual episode goes, they are each made by different producers much like the other person mentioned. That being said, it really brings a whole new take on halo. The art styles alone on some of the episodes are just great.     Overall I'd can personally suggest anyone who enojoyed halo should buy OR at LEAST rent this.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|District 9 is a landmark science fiction film that tells a story of incredible originality. On the surface is it about a man who is forced to grow close to an alien once he has been infected with their DNA and is running afoul of the authorities. It is also a parable for the South African apartheid that is so caustic to different races there- it's not coincidental that it is set in Johannesburg. Allusions are kept tucked away in the background, though, and what you get instead is great storytelling. The film moves like a freight train and is always inventive in its plotting and structure. It is aided by seamless CGI effects, populating the rusted shacks of the ghetto with agitated creatures that are as scared of man as they are willing to destroy them. Also of note is the film's very fine performances and screenplay. It takes a pretty special hand to make you grow empathetic to seven foot-tall lobsteresque things, but by the end of this one you'll be rooting for the alien dad's little guy. Here's hoping for a sequel.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|Great quality and sound. A huge improvement over the previous releases of some of these songs. Someone said about a third of the content on these CDs is unreleased and I think that's about right. Hearing the whole run of these shows in their entirety is very cool too.
B002WY65UQ|5.0|Ok, we aren't talking Shakespeare here. The comedy is broad and a little crass BUT it's done so well and with such a sense of fun that you're drawn into it for an enjoyable romp. Rupert Everett handles the Miss Fritton role just as well as Alastair Sim over 50 years earlier.<br />Well done and a lot of fun. Aw come on! Have a little guilty fun!
B001P3SA8U|2.0|I hated Cadillac Records but I stayed with it for the soundtrack and the hope that it would get better. Len Chess isn't the only paternalistic thing about this film. A mishmash timeline of race cliches and lazy storytelling, Cadillac Records can't even be bothered to get it's facts straight. Saving it from one star are the performances of Columbus Short, Mos Def and Eamonn Walker, all of whom are far better than the material deserves. The film provides about as much context as a 1950's Looney Tunes featuring celebrities of the day. Even if one allows for the need to condense a large story into a short time frame, have some continuity of character inside the abbreviated version. Disjointed, relying on race role tropes instead of characterization, Cadillac Records is a lazy film that does a disservice to all whom it portrays.
B001HBX8NC|5.0|This is an exemplary disc on many levels.  The singing is top-notch with Nucci a standout.  All the acting is effective and suits the music.  The best part is, unlike many other blues, the visual aspects are great: no awkward editing, strange cuts, unusual camera placement or inappropriate camera movement.  The background characters and extras are directed well.
1401323820|4.0|Perfect for what it is, I mean. For a mystery novel based on a TV show, this is very well done. It's a nice little mystery book and also exactly the sort of thing the TV character would have written based on the other characters from the show. As a tie-in to the show and an almost-joke/promotional stunt, it is exactly what it should be. I enjoyed reading it as much as watching an episode of Castle. Which is pretty much exactly what I expected.
0553801503|1.0|This is a novel full of cliffhangers to a story that will never be finished. I've been waiting 3 years now on the supposedly finished (at the time) other half of the story. Do yourself a favor and read Steven Erikson instead.
B0009A40ES|5.0|GREAT movie, GREAT cast, GREAT acting, GREAT soundtrack! If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly suggest you buy it. It is FANTASTIC! Just make sure you can handle gore. Christian Bale does a fantastic job!
B002QGUFWE|1.0|Its a great addition to an already great album, but this CD is Censored! even the original tracks.<br /><br />I don't understand why the law requires labels to state when a CD is the original and contains explicit language but they don't have to inform you if the CD you're buying has been modified (censored) from the original.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|The Swivel Sweeper I purchased only picks up very small things and often will pick things up and spit them back out. Not worth the money.
0670021652|3.0|I loved Eat Pray and Love.  This book is quite different.  I found the history of marriage very interesting.   There are sections that one has to work through, there are also gems along the way that are worth the read.  I like that Ms. Gilbert had the courage to write something different, and true to her experience.  I also like that she is true to herself without apparent worry about being politically correct.  I am certain she will get lots of complaints about her view from folks who feel otherwise.  I for one, admire her courage to stand for what she believes.
0307269981|4.0|I really liked this edition, once I picked it and the story began to take off, which was somewhere around the one hundred and twentieth page or so, it proved to be very difficult to put down. There were many, many twists and turns as the plot began to unfold, and you discover what really happened to land her in the foster care system, mind you this is Sweden and not America. How her mother came to pass, that she is not an only child, and what is most curious is who her father is and how her relationship with him developed and in general her disdain or love for him grows. It is her relationship with her father, her friends and Blomkvist, how these relationships play out and mature. She is after all on the run and in hiding for being an accused murderer, and as you read, you will discover much about her history and the people that she has come to respect and admire.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|I think I enjoy the soundtrack even more than the movie! Energizing, engaging, mysterious, powerful. very interesting combination of instruments, styles, yet it all comes together in a powerful swirl of action and intreique.  I listen to this album when I feel I want to get something accomplished during the day.
B0010V4TZU|1.0|Wow...this is bad. Wanted to like it after hearing an interview with the band..cool guys..crappy music.Allowing so called college radio to decide what's talent is a greater sin than allowing 13 year old teenage girls to decide who's the next \\"American Idol\\"
B0000524E5|5.0|Graced with a velvet voice, 21-year-old Violet Sanforn heads to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a songwriter only to find her aspirations sidelined by the accolades and notoriety she receives at her \\"day\\" job as a barmaid at Coyote Ugly. A new nightclub with a twist, Coyote Ugly is the hottest spot in town, featuring a team of sexy, enterprising young women. Lil is the savvy and tough proprietor with an autocratic reign over her girls, including the ever-flitarious Cammie, headstrong and antagonistic Rachel and top tip earner Zoe. Coyote Ugly. It is a very fun and exciting movie. There is also extremely good music in the movie, and also has a great soundtrack. This is a very good movie.
B00008AWON|5.0|First off I would warn against comparing this album to other releases for the sole reason that this is it's own album! So many people have said \\"Oh it's not Without You I'm nothing or Black Market Music.\\" DUH!!! This is a step in a different direction. That's what good bands do, they explore and experiment. Placebo is no different.    With that said, I have to admit this is my favorite record by Placebo. From start to finish nothing but beauty escapes the speakers. It is very diverse, almost eclectic, but very \\"together\\" at the same time. The album is laden with synths and drum loops, yet you'll find more than a couple rockers reminiscent of earlier Placebo here as well. Sleeping With Ghosts is never boring. It's a journey that takes you through many highs and lows alike. The signature sound is still here, sex drugs and eyeliner, yet it feels more mature. The mood of this album is just perfect. Every track is a standout, and if you asked, I wouldn't be able to say which is my favorite, or even narrow it down to a top three. If you like Placebo, or just good music, then do yourself a favor; BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00005S6K8|5.0|The daughter of a wealthy family's butler leaves for Paris an ordinary girl, but returns a beautiful woman, much to the delight of the wealthy family's oldest son. This is a lovely movie. I loved every minute of it.  Julia Ormond is just stunning in this movie, and Harrison Ford also. Watch this movie it's totally worth it.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|The season was awesome and it arrived before Christmas. thank you for that. i didn't have a lot of money to work with and it was for my mother. thank you for getting it to me before Christmas and it was in perfect condition. she loved it. thank you again and you are true to your word.
B002GHHHL0|5.0|In her efforts to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease, Dr. Susan McAlester implants human brain tissue into sharks. The experiment backfires, producing a horrifying species of killer sharks with the capacity to think like humans. This movie has action, suspense, horror and serious gore. The visuals are amazing and the movie was only made in 1999. A superb movie, it's not Jaws even better.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|HBO's Southern Gothic marvel, \\"True Blood,\\" may never reach the hallowed heights attained by \\"The Wire\\" but that doesn't mean that it isn't first-rate television.  \\"The Wire\\" was amazing for lots of reasons, but it is my all-time favorite show because it was so deeply rooted in the real-world hell that is modern Baltimore.  This show reveled in its humanity as it indicted virtually every aspect of society, from the political to the religious to the educational system to journalism to the police to the citizens of the city themselves.  No other great HBO series has been so grounded in the real world while offering such riveting entertainment.    \\"True Blood,\\" on the other hand, is pure fantasy set in the Bayou Country of Louisiana.  This series, just like \\"The Sopranos\\" or \\"Deadwood,\\" is as out-of-this-world as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" despite being set in the United States.  The township of Bon Temps, Louisiana, is one of those hole-in-the-wall burgs where, despite a classic Southern diet full of beer and crawfish, most of the leading characters could have just stepped out of a racy lingerie catalog.  Our heroine is Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin of \\"The Piano\\" and \\"X-Man\\" fame), a charming Southern belle who is cursed with telepathy - not the best superpower to have when you're a gorgeous waitress slinging pitchers of beer wearing hot pants and a clinging white T-shirt.      Sookie's life is already strange enough, what with her telepathy and the fact that vampires now live among humans, allegedly thanks to a Japanese invention of synthetic blood that eliminates the need for vampires to treat humans like cattle.  (Anyone who believes that this has tamed the vampires, well, stand on your head.)  Sookie's brother Jason is the town boy-toy - all muscles and libiido, even when the women he's toying around with start showing up dead.  Her parents are dead (killed years ago in a flash flood) and has been raised by her charming grandmother.    And then Bill shows up, and things get really strange.    For Bill is a vampire - a Confederate soldier who is now all smouldering sexuality and chiseled physique.  The mutual attraction between Sookie and Bill is palpable, and their soon-torrid romance is the talk of the town between both humans and vampires alike.  (For those of you who first saw Ms. Paquin as an adorable cherub in her earlier films, be advised that this series is as raunchy as anything HBO has ever filmed.)      As with all great HBO shows, there are too many intriguing supporting characters to mention.  Just when you think you're getting a handle on the storyline, a new character pops up or an unexpected revelation forces you to see an older character in a whole new light.  Thanks to some excellent writing, this tale of vampirism, voodoo, racism, sex, and that certain mystique that makes Louisiana the most romantic state in the country stays just on the good side of ridiculous.    This is not PG-13 stuff, so I cannot say it is fun for the whole family.  But it's darn fine television and is sure to work its magic on you.
B00000JMOJ|5.0|Set in a totalitarian society. Ben Richards is a cop who was blamed for a massacre which wasn't his fault. He would be sent to prison and breaks out with some other inmates. He tries to escape but the woman whom he dragged into his plan turns him over to the authorities. Damon Killian, who is the host of THE RUNNING MAN a game show wherein convicted felons are given the chance to run to freedom but have to elude the stalkers; men who hunt them down and kill them in gruesome manners. Of all Arnold's mid-'80s movies who would have thought that most relevant today would be The Running Man. A chilling and surprisingly realistic tale of reality TV gone mad. It may have been far-fetched back then but not so now. Not when you think about it. Watch this movie and see for yourself.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I consider this one of the best albums of the 00s.  Never much of a Wilco fan before, these songs really speak to me and the melodies are beautiful.  The songs are more upbeat and catchier than anything else I've heard from Wilco.  Can't recommend highly enough.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|We love Norah, and this CD does not disappoint.  A great mix of slow and upbeat tunes, wonderful listening.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|This is such a fun read! I definitely recommend it. I was laughing throughout the entirety of the book--I kept getting weird stares from the people near me. If you're an American and you've ever traveled or lived abroad, you'll appreciate this book. It's highly entertaining! I read it on my Kindle, and it was formatted well. It does not have the text-to-speech option, however, but I don't really use that. I just wish more of his books were available for the Kindle.
B0012GMZMW|5.0|Journey is back, this is a great CD.  Bought for my wife, but we are all enjoying it.
0670021652|5.0|People who were hoping for another round of EPL, well, go back and read EPL again. (I did. In fact I think there could be a lively book club of people who have read that book twice.)    Committed is a lovely look at the natural history of marriage (if you like Diane Ackerman, you'll enjoy this book). And it's a perfect and appropriate approach to telling the story of the next phase of her new life. Sure, I'd love to know more about her relationship with \\"Felipe,\\" but that would be just prurient nosiness.  And we really don't need to hear more about her calling out her own name, do we?    Committed makes me very happy I'm single. Not because I'm against marriage. I'm not even a marriage skeptic. But I'm a marriage independent. And now I have good reasons why. And maybe one day I'll be peacefully independent within a marriage. But if not, that's okay too.

B000A7S4B0|4.0|Black Rebel Motorcycle Club started off playing hard rock influenced by British bands such as Led Zeppelin, but on this their third album the band show other sides of themselves, with several songs similar to those of the young Bob Dylan.<br /><br />The acoustic guitar is the most dominant instrument, which gives the numbers a crisp sound and the music in general a softer sound.<br /><br />The songwriting is mostly very strong, and the album contains many very fine tracks with inspiration from many different musical genres, such as folk,  blues and gospel.<br /><br />The opening track \\"Shuffle Your Feet\\" actually contains elements from those genres, and and works fine as the starting point for the rest of the album.<br /><br />The title-track \\"Howl\\" is a very British sounding number - slow tempo with organ and very hymn-like. Nice number.<br /><br />Almost pure acoustic folk are the songs \\"Devil's Waiting,\\" \\"Fault Line\\", \\"Restless Sinner\\" and \\"Complicated Situation\\" - all fine tracks,  probably with the latter as the most memorable. Bob Dylan must have been part of the inspiration for these songs.<br /><br />\\"Is No Easy Way Out\\" is a number that could well have fitted into Led Zeppelin's third album, which was also very folk-inspired.<br /><br />Other songs sound very inspired by Marc Bolan and T. Rex - this applies for example, \\"Weight of the World,\\" \\"Sympathetic Noose\\" - two of the album's very best - and also the final track \\"The Line\\"<br /><br />The very melodic side, almost ballad like, shows on numbers such as \\"Still Suspicion Holds You Tight\\" and \\"Promise.\\"<br /><br />A different BRMC album, but perhaps their most durable.
B00005QXDD|2.0|2 1/2    TD's debut might be the only bit of Yankovician music I can appreciate, but even with a few songs that completely outshine their comedic confines, the album becomes a chore to sit through by the time it has finished.
0226264211|5.0|This is a very important book, but was hard for me to read the first time I tried.  I put the book down and read Thomas Sowell's Basic Economics (which is also excellent) and then after learning more about Milton Friedman and watching his 1980 Free to Choose documentary (on Google Video), I came back to this book with more motivation and found it easier to read.     In order for Milton's ideas to be robust and widely applicable, he presents them in a more abstract language than I'm used to.  I would put this book in the philosophy, economics and political theory category.    I'll likely read parts of this book a second time.      Milton Friedman is my favorite economist - Thomas Sowell, Russ Roberts and Eric Hanushek are some of my other favorites.      I believe Milton is on par with Thomas Jefferson in his accomplishments and communication skills, and this books is one of his greatest political works.    I highly recommend searching YouTube and Google video for Milton's interviews and debates.
1416583408|4.0|This book is for dog lovers what Alton Brown's Food Network show \\"Good Eats\\" is for food lovers - if you like to understand the *why*(I do) and you're a dog lover (I am), you'll love this book (I did).    For 40+ years I have had one or more dogs in my life. I can't imagine having a home without a dog, and always thought that I more or less understood the dogs whom I've lived with. I was wrong. In the 2 or 3 weeks since I finished reading this book my relationship with my current dogs - Lou and Serge, two young adult dachshunds who are integral members of our household - has been richer and more enjoyable than I thought possible, both for me and, I think anyway, for them.    Through a nice combination of hard science from her job and anecdotes from her personal relationship with her dog, Ms. Horowitz creates a basis for a real understanding of how/what *your* dog is communicating to you, and how/what you're communicating to him/her. She shares what scientific examination by her and others has revealed about the vocabulary that dogs use in their communication with one another, and she lenses that through her own personal experience as a dog person to provide insights into what it might mean for those of us who are also dog people.    If you have wanted a book to help you better observe your dogs, interpret what they are \\"saying\\" to you, and use the knowledge to be closer to your pet and interact with him/her with greater understanding, you will want to read this book!
B000SJHNB2|3.0|I purchased my Behringer Ha400 headphone amplifier in November of 2008, and it died in December of 2009.  It was never abused; I never used more than two headsets at a time, and never operated any of the controls (whichever stereo channel I had the headphones plugged into) at more than 50% volume.  Yet at around one year of infrequent use it began to lose volume, then stopped working altogether, though the green power light continued to work.  I went back through my old Amazon orders thinking perhaps it was still under warranty but alas, it had only a 1-year warranty, which was . . . expired.    It did however work quite well . . . for a year.
B001NLKT60|3.0|While it has its moments, this book is nowhere near as good as the first in the series.  The middle of the novel plods along and then, finally,  the author races too quickly to an unsatisfying cliffhanger conclusion.
0962477060|5.0|My first guitar instructor, \\"Bob\\" turned me onto the CAGED system by handing me a photocopy of a page from the book, \\"Scales & Modes in the Beginning\\" by Don Middelbrook. I loved that book because it taught everything from a pattern point-of-view which made soloing easy & learning all the scales WAY easier.<br /><br />But I still didn't fully understand the concept of the fretboard & WHY it was laid out the way it was. That is until I bought THIS book, Fretboard Logic!<br />  T<br />You know that proverbial Eureka! that everyone jokes about? It came on in my head when I began to study it because it took the CAGED system & made it accessible to me. I already knew how to play the CAGED system because I'd already learned the patterns BUT I was wholly inept at explaining why the system is laid out the way it is. \\"Bob\\" just couldn't explain it to me in laymen's terms even though he was a welder by day & guitar instructor by night.<br /><br />The section on Diatonic Lead Patterns really helped me understand the need for vertical runs & how they're achieved. Yeah I knew you cold take a few of the CAGED patterns &/or Modes & connect the dots & root notes but again, you're talking about dexterity & proficiency versus deeper understanding. I feel once you grasp that deeper understanding, then the rest is WAY easier! Why? Once you know the why & how of it, then all you need to do is spend time practicing the scales, licks & leads so you can gain the finger dexterity.<br /><br />Do I consider myself a musician? No. I'm just an afternoon plunker but I can still hold my own with just about anyone in any key & that's where I'm happiest. I can jam with just about anyone & stay in the melody & yet solo when I get the nod.<br /><br />I seriously suggest you spend the little money this book costs & set aside an hour each day to study it thoroughly THEN practice it religiously. By doing so, your understanding & grasp of music (an abstract thing I might add) will begin to nudge you towards the Eureka! or epiphany like I had. Will it come overnight? No, don't kid yourself. Mine didn't either BUT I promise you it WILL come if you're diligent & persistent.<br /><br />I rate this manual 5 out of 5 stars for ease of understanding, completeness & layout. My only gripe is that I wish it were bound on rings so it would lay flat on my music stand. (Hint, Hint!) I'm thinking about taking my copy, cutting off the spine & having it bound in wire rings so it can do that. I hate paperback & hardback music books because they don't lay flat on the music stand.I had. Will it come overnight? No, don't kid yourself.

B002T9H2MO|5.0|Sam Bell (Sam Roackwell) works on the moon for a company called Lunar Industries. In the distant future, the Earth's natural resources are all used up. Lunar Industries has decided to farm the dark side of the moon for He3 which is then sent back to Earth to use to run the planet. Sam Bell's job is to make sure all the equipment is running well. At the beginning of the movie we join Sam, who has 2 weeks left on a 3 year stint. The only source of comradery that Sam has, is his robot GERTY (voiced perfectly by Kevin Spacey), who seems to be a distant relative of HAL from 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. The only way Sam can communicate with his family, wife Tess (Dominique McElligott) is through video postcards.     during one of Sam's ride in his moon rover, he gets in to an accident. After blacking out we are taken to a few days later when Sam wakes up in sick bay. Sam doesn't remember what happened or why he is in sick bay. GERTY tells Sam that his boses have said for him to rest and they are sending a rescue ship to fix rover and collection vehicle that Sam crashed into. After a few days, Sam is able to talk GERTY into letting him outside, and he visits the crash site. Upon looking in the rover, he finds a body there. Sam brings the body back to homebase, and the person he finds is, Sam Bell. The viewer doesn't know if one of the other is a clone, or a figment of Sam's imagination, or a dream.     Duncan Jones (who also directed and is the son of rock legend David Bowie) and Nathan Parker co-wrote an amazing piece of cinema that makes the viewer think. You're not sure if everything you've seen is real, and that's the way it should be. You can see that Jones and Parker have been influenced hevily by 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, from GERTY, to having classical music playing when Sam goes out to walk or drive around on the moon, to the lonely worker.     Sam Rockwell does an amazing job of acting only against Kevin Spacey's voice and himself. This is essentially an actors movie. Ifyou are looking to see how to be a great actor, Rockwell's preformance is one to be seen. It's a real shame that this movie was released in the summer, during the time of the blockbuster, because this is certainly a movie that should be seen by everyone.     4 1/2 out of 5
B000QRIGLC|1.0|Horrible- just horrible.  A complete waste of a book and a worthy subject.  Horrible.
B000005RU2|3.0|I won't repeat what others have written - I love the band and have great memories of the LP so I jumped for this import remastered version hoping it would have the same impact and dynamics of the LP.  It doesn't.  I have a new and really nice audio system and ordered $200 or so of cds, ordering only those version rated highly in the sound quality/remastering category.  This one was a disapointment to me.  Not very dynamic and a bit shrill.  I'll keep my out for the DCC version which I know will sound great but the price is crazy at over $100.
0670021652|3.0|\\"Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage,\\" though not without its merits, reads more like a project than a page-turner, the latter what one expects from the bestselling author of \\"Eat, Pray, Love.\\" More significantly, \\"Committed\\" manifests as a vulnerable, somewhat apologetic discourse about marriage that's informed by the author's research on the fly and a growing desperation as she and her lover Felipe travel through Southeast Asia on a very limited budget and under emotional duress.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert, more the journalist this time than memoirist, explores the institution of marriage after she's told that if she wants to live with her Brazilian lover in this country, they're going to have to get married. As if to prove they're serious, Homeland Security/matchmaker arrests Felipe at a Texas airport, handcuffs, jails and deports him. This single event is a book all in itself, especially since Felipe has been doing business in the United States for a very long time. Felipe's life with Gilbert will never feel secure after this experience and the book, one assumes, must never offend Homeland Security.<br /><br />Gilbert and Felipe, though they've taken personal vows and exchanged rings in a private commitment ceremony before Felipe's enforced exile, nonetheless express a vehement disdain of the legal institution of marriage. Their private vows confuse me, especially since these vows are a mirror reflection of the act they so despise. And what is marriage, really, but a vow of commitment made legal. Commitment in this society at this time is on shaky ground, regardless of legalities. The divorce rate is at 50 percent. When this couple signs a pre-nup agreement, their questions about marriage lose vitality or approach something very close to moot.<br /><br />Gilbert has a right to question marriage. Her first ended in a bad divorce and she's paying alimony now. Felipe's marriage also ended badly. And, as Gilbert shows so well, women who marry have a lot to lose and men have a lot to gain. She doesn't want to marry, even if what she's saying is she doesn't want to be forced to buy into a system that subjugates and even punishes not only her but her mother, sisters, grandmothers and beloved friends. Fine. I get it. But, as you find out, the couple has no choice. A book seeking a rational way to think about marriage, given the problems she has with marriage, seems beside the point under these circumstances.<br /><br />After Felipe is arrested at an airport in Texas and deported, Gilbert commences on a study of marriage while she accompanies Felipe on a nearly yearlong sojourn around Southeast Asia, where living is cheap. Exiled and demoralized, Felipe cannot even regain access to his business records and his inventory of jewelry and gems, all of which remain in the United States. It takes months of legal wrangling and reams of paperwork, but eventually Homeland Security allows Felipe access to the United States as long as he and Gilbert marry.<br /><br />Gilbert is candid.<br /><br />\\"Do I sound like I'm trying to talk myself into something here?\\" she writes toward the conclusion.<br /><br />\\"People, I am trying to talk myself into something here.\\"<br /><br />Candor is not effective defense. And her roundabout journey of discovery, which leads her to conclude that marriage is a subversive act, leaves something to be desired.<br /><br />There's a frantic moment toward the end where the author races, trips, races, in chaotic retreat to her hotel in Cambodia. Children are chasing her and she becomes increasingly flummoxed. Something about this scene speaks to the forced nature of the book, the actions of the two lovers, and perhaps, something about the precarious nature of marriage. Sometimes you just need to stop, admit the realities, and bite the bullet. The alternative is some kind of off-kilter exercise where one might trip up.<br /><br />Rae Francoeur's book \\"Free Fall: A Late-in-Life Love Affair,\\" comes out in April.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Without getting wordy, I think this was a great book. Easy reading, not a lot of details to remember, a dog is narrating the story and I didn't think this was weird. I felt many emotions while I read this book. I loved it. You need to read it too.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Color me surprised, but this movie was downright fantastic.  I really expected something so much less than what I received.  Instead, what I found was a deeply moving, completely engrossing, totally organic and convincing portrait of the grit that is the life of crime AND the life of those who try and prevent it.  With comparisons to `The Godfather' and `GoodFellas', `Donnie Brasco' is the type of film that really had to deliver in order to make any sort of impact.<br /><br />Personally, `Donnie Brasco' blows `GoodFellas' out of the water.<br /><br />Based on the real life memoirs of Joe Pistone, `Donnie Brasco' centers around the world of Joe (or Donnie), an ambitious undercover cop who infiltrates the New York mob scene when he gets placed under the wing of Benjamin `Lefty' Ruggiero, a `made man' who takes a liking (almost paternal) to Donnie.  As Donnie gets deeper and deeper into this world of which he is trying to expose, he finds his personal life slipping away from him.  Soon, his family is torn in two as his wife begins to resent him for his involvement and before he knows it, he has become the very thing he has sworn to destroy.<br /><br />I have made it pretty clear that I personally feel Al Pacino has wasted his talent pretty much as soon as the 70's ended.  He is one of those actors who was SO good and then suddenly became nothing more than a clich&eacute;.  He is nearly irrelevant today.  That said, his performance in `Donnie Brasco' is a work of genius.  I just cannot believe that this is AL PACINO.  He really reaches back to his glory days and delivers an outstanding portrayal of a man intent of surviving yet never so much that he loses touch of what makes him human.  Watching Lefty interact with the ruthless people around him brings an odd fascination.  Lefty seems almost like an outcast.  He is strong and certainly authentic, but he feels almost too warm at times, which adds to his character's remarkable development (such a superbly crafted sympathetic character that never grates on clich&eacute;d manipulative sentiments).<br /><br />I've also made it pretty clear that I consider Johnny Depp an overrated actor.  So many consider him the `it' guy today.  It is very cool to like Johnny Depp, but personally he hasn't delivered a strong performance for me in many years.  I was hesitant to watch this film because I am not a fan of either Pacino or Depp, but I must say that this may be Depp's finest performance to date (I adore him in `Benny and Joon', but the depth he brings to Donnie is completely remarkable).  There is a loneliness that Depp captures, perfectly depicting the descention his character is making into that dark hole that is his profession.<br /><br />Like I said, color me surprised.<br /><br />With outstanding supporting performances by Anne Heche and Michael Madsen, not to mention a memorable turn from Bruno Kirby (so underrated in his day as a supporting player), `Donnie Brasco' is an acting triumph.  Not just that, it is marvelously scripted to completely engage the audience.  The film has so much grit and realism.  You can really see both sides of this world, and the film makes no attempts to glamorize of paint this `life' as something jovial.  Mike Newell's direction is stellar, completely capturing the emotional as well as the visual impact of the subject.<br /><br />I don't think enough words can be said in complete praise and admiration of this film.  It is simply outstanding in all respects.tes on clichéd manipulative sentiments).      I've also made it pretty clear that I consider Johnny Depp an overrated actor.

B00009MGGI|5.0|At long last I have finally gotten the chance to sit down and watch the trilogy of miniseries's known simply as the House Of Cards trilogy. Based on the novel trilogy by UK author Michael Dobbs the three miniseries's (House Of Cards, To Play The King and The Final Cut) detail the rise and fall of Francis Urquhart, a politician of the UK's Conservative Party played by the late, great Ian Richardson. To help you the reader decide if you'd like to purchase this DVD box-set here are reviews of all three parts of the trilogy.<br /><br />House Of Cards:<br /><br />I'm a sucker for both British television and political thrillers in general. So having heard much about this miniseries, the first of a trilogy of miniseries's, I have been looking forward to seeing this for some time. Having seen it, I found that my expectations have not only been reached but surpassed as well. House Of Cards is one of the finest examples of the political thriller that you are likely to see anywhere.<br /><br />If there is any single element that makes this miniseries as much of a success as it is, it is lead character,  Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Richardson plays Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of late 1980's or early 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III. Urquhart is a  man who,as  the Chief Whip who feels unappreciated by the Prime Minister he helped to elect, sets out to bring down the Prime Minister, and then take the job of for himself. Like Richard III, Urquhart does this by laying out traps, rumors and blackmail while all the while delivering soliloquies to the audience relaying them to us the viewer. For all intents and purposes, Urquhart is a man we should hate as he does all of those things. Yet it is Richardson makes this work incredibly well and makes Urquhart a man who is ruthless yet immensely charming and likeable nonetheless. It is a compliment to Richardson and his skills that he can make it all work, especially the soliloquies, while being evil yet charming all at the same time.<br /><br />Backing Richardson is a fine supporting cast  as well. There's Diane Fletcher as Urquhart's wife who, like Lady Macbeth, pushed her husband and his plans along which makes her a character that is almost as fascinating as her husband. There's Susannah Harker as the young, attractive reporter Mattie Storin who begins using Urquhart as a source before they start going in a dangerous direction which leads to an incredible finale. There's Miles Anderson as Roger O'Neill and Alphonsia Emmanuel as his girlfriend Penny Guy who both end up snared by Urquhart's traps and end up victims of that. There's Colin Jeavons as Urquhart's protege Tim Stamper who has a marvelously sleazy feel to him. Last but not least there's David Lyon as the targeted Prime Minister Henry Collingridge and James Villiers as his brother Charles, who end's up being part of  Urquhart's plans. Theses are only a few of those amongst others in what is a fine cast backing a great leading man.<br /><br />House Of Cards is also blessed with fine production values as well. There's some fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from the Houses of Parliament, 10 Downing Street, press rooms and beyond. There's the cinematography of Jim Fyans and Ian Punter which brings a fine sense of atmosphere and shadows to the world of the miniseries. There's also the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. All of this, under the direction of Paul Seed, makes for some fine production values to the miniseries.<br /><br />Last but not least is the script. Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs novel into a fine political thriller about the effect of power on one man and how far he will go to gain power. There is a definite Richard III vibe running throughout the entire miniseries as Urquhart decides to seize power and begins to lay plans to do so. As a consequence, the plot can get fairly complex at time with Urquhart playing numerous plans at once which will require the viewer to pay just a bit more then perhaps they usually would. Also, Davies knows how to write fine dialogue especially for Urquhart including the famous line \\"You may think that, but I couldn't possibly comment.\\" The script never fails to deliver right up to the shocking finale.<br /><br />House Of Cards is a fine example of what the political thriller can be. From the performance of Ian Richardson as Urquhart, the performances of the supporting cast, good production values and a fantastic script as well. It is a complex story with a complex protagonist that takes a look at power and its ability to corrupt and how far one will go to achieve it and is a fine one at that.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />To Play The King:<br /><br />Francis Urquhart has risen through the ranks of Britain's Conservative Party and its political ranks to become Prime Minister. Now a new King is being crowned who stands opposed to everything Urquhart stands for. What happens when a liberally minded King and a conservative Prime Minister meet head to head in a battle for control of the UK's political life? That is the question that lies at the heart of To Play The King, the second miniseries in the House Of Cards trilogy.<br /><br />Like its predecessor, if  there is any single element that makes this miniseries as much of a success as it is, it is lead character,  Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Richardson plays Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of early 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III as much as he did originally. Urquhart might be at the top, but he's determined to stay there at whatever cost as he tries first to use and then do battle with the King. Yet we begin to see the human side of this man as he haunted by the events at the end of House Of Cards and must face the possibility of treason by those closest to him. Once again, Richardson makes all this work incredibly well and makes Urquhart a man who is ruthless yet immensely charming and likeable nonetheless. It is a compliment to Richardson and his skills that he can make it all work, especially the soliloquies, while being evil yet charming all at the same time.<br /><br />Opposing Urquhart is the new King played by actor Michael Kitchen. Kitchen's King is a  likeable, charming liberally minded monarch who wants to use his place in the nation to help improve his country. When any and all of his ideas are tossed aside, the king is forced into a head to head confrontation with the Prime Minister. Kitchen plays the King as a man of principle who is really a simple man. In fact it his the King hopes that right equals might in taking on Urquhart that makes him a perfect antagonist and a worthy opponent indeed.<br /><br />Backing both Richardson and Kitchen is once again a fine supporting cast. Returning from House Of Cards are Diane Fletcher as Urquhart's wife plus  Colin Jeavons as Tim Stamper, who finds himself increasingly compromised and frustrated by Urquhart, who both give strong performances. Kitty Aldridge joins the cast as Sarah Harding who becomes a communications aide to Urquhart and while she gives a good performance, the relationship between her and Urquhart pushed believability in my mind. There's also Nicholas Farrell and Rowena King as the King's aides David Mycroft and Chloe Carmichael, respectively, who both find themselves having the help the King do battle and face becoming causalities themselves. There's also Nick Brimble as security man Corder and Bernice Stegers as the estranged Princess Charlotte who leave quite an impression with their brief appearances. Not forgetting Susannah Harker as Mattie Storin who, while only appearing in sound and film clips from House Of Cards, still looms large over the events that unfold. Like its predecessor, this miniseries is blessed by a fine cast backing its two leading men.<br /><br />There's the production values as well. Many of those who worked on House Of Cards returned to this miniseries and their work is just as good here. Once again there's fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and beyond. There's also the cinematography of Jim Fyans and Ian Punter which once again brings a fine sense of atmosphere to the world of the miniseries. Last but not least here is once again the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. All of this, once again under the direction of Paul Seed, helps to make the miniseries stand up against its predecessor well indeed.<br /><br />Which brings us to the script. Once again  Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs novel into a script that is less a political thriller then a political parable if not satire at times. Davies looks at what happens when the two opposing mind sets of a liberally minded King and a conservative Prime Minister meet head to head. The result is a battle of wits as the two men attempt through their various lieutenants to help their cause come out on top. It is a story about the modern process of media control and how that can clash with both the idealistic and the cynical alike. It is also a story that looks at how power effects those who hold it as Urquhart is haunted by the events at the end of House Of Cards and must face the possibility of treason by two of those closest to him. There's also a fair bit of satire as well covering the scandals of the royal family in the early 1990's and the media's reactions to them as well. The result is a script that isn't quite as gripping as House Of Cards but more thought provoking.<br /><br />To Play The King is a fine successor to House Of Cards. From the performances of Richardson and Kitchen in the lead roles, a fine supporting cast,  good production values and a well written script as well. While it is not the thriller the original was and is somewhat less gripping as a result, To Play The King works as something else instead. It is a parable about what happens when the liberally minded and the conservatively minded face each other head on. The result is thought provoking indeed.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />The Final Cut:<br /><br />Having risen through the ranks of the United Kingdom's Conservative Party in House Of Cards and having consolidated power in To Play The King, Francis Urquhart (played once again by Ian Richardson) is on the verge of becoming the longest serving Prime Minister. Yet the pieces are slowly moving against him for last game of power politics. The stage is set for The Final Cut, the final miniseries in the House Of Cards trilogy.<br /><br />Like its two predecessors, the miniseries's success lies in its lead character Francis Urquhart as played by actor Ian Richardson. Urquhart, who has served as Prime Minister for approximately a decade, is making plans for his eventual retirement while seeking a fitting legacy. Yet the skeletons of the past aren't quite as quite as dead and buried as he might think though as things slowly come out to threaten his very political existence. Richardson continues to play Urquhart as a modern day (modern day being an alternate version of mid to late 1990's UK) version of Shakespeare's Richard III but there's a more human element in this last act as well. Here's a man whose played numerous power games and finds himself risking more and more in one final play for power and, in this case, a fine legacy as well. In a way this may well be Richardson's finest performance in the role of Urquhart.<br /><br />There's also another major player who deserves mention. Diane Fletcher, who had largely been on the sidelines in the two previous miniseries, gets her biggest role in the trilogy as Urquhart'swife Elizabeth and this is as much her series as it is Richardson. Her she is revealed to be just as cunning and manipulative as her husband as she helps to set up the Urquhart Trust and watches her husbands final power plays with increasing worry. Also of interest is Elizabeth's hinted at relationship with security man Corder which brings a new dimension to this series, especially in regards to the ending. All of this gives Fletcher a chance to show off her skills and makes The Final Cut as much hers and his.<br /><br />Which brings us to the supporting cast which is a bit mixed. On the plus side are Paul Freeman as Tom Makepeace, the Conservative party politician who grows increasingly wary of and eventually becomes the one who may finally be able to bring Urquhart down. There's also Isla Blair as Claire Carlsen who rises within Urquhart's ranks while being involved with one of the PM rival's. Last but not least is Nick Brimble as Corder who gets a large role in the proceedings and the aforementioned relationship with Urquahrt's wife as well. On the downside are Nickolas Grace who gives a sleazy and annoying performance as Geoffrey Booza Pitt and Joseph Long as the rather bumbling and  ineffective Cyprus President. The supporting cast overall is a mixed bunch which dampens the success of The Final Cut somewhat.<br /><br />The production values hold up well for the most parts. Once again there's fine production design by Ken Ledsham who creates the worlds ranging from 10 Downing Street, Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament, and beyond though somehow there seems a very low budget feel to the scenes set in Cyprus. There's also the cinematography of Ian Punter which once again brings a fine sense of atmosphere to the world of the miniseries. Last but not least here is once again the music by Jim Parker, especially with the main title and end title pieces which serve as a perfect start and closing to the four episodes of the miniseries. Sadly what seems to be lacking is the direction of Mike Vardy who makes this final part seem to be both very sleazy (including unnecessary nudity especially considering the lack of it earlier in the trilogy) and snail paced throughout. The result is, like the supporting cast, something that dampens the success of this final part.<br /><br />Last but not least is the script.  Once again Andrew Davies adapts Michael Dobbs (who is uncredited as the novel's author due to creative conflicts with the makers of the series) novel into a script which takes a look at a seasoned politician and his last grasps at power. Urquhart seems obsessed at times with the shadow of predecessor Margret Thatcher (who appears to have died just before the beginning of the series) and him staying as Prime Minister longer then she was and securing a fitting legacy to his tenure. Yet there are ghosts of the past that begin to haunt Urquhart more and more. Here we learn more of Urquhart's past including his army tenure in Cyprus and how it now threatens to bring him down. There's the machinations of those in his government as well including Makepeace who prepares to challenge him for power as well. Together the script offers us a look at the fall of one government, the effect of that on the man in charge of it and the rise of its successor. That's not the say that this is a perfect script though as there are some decidedly sleazy and improbable aspects to the story as well, including the rather unsatisfactory ending which seems a rather convoluted way to end the trilogy of miniseries's. Maybe those are the faults of the novel rather then the script but there is something not quite right with this final part of the House Of Cards trilogy.<br /><br />The Final Cut proves to be the last, if unsatisfactory, part of the House Of Cards trilogy. While there's fine performances from Richardson and Fletcher plus much of the supporting cast the issues with other members of the supporting cast, some low budget feels, direction andscript issues weigh this part down significantly. The result is a good but overall unsatisfactory conclusion which seems rather a shame.<br /><br />3.5/5<br /><br />Overall it's a fine set of miniseries's. There's three fine performances from Ian Richardson which alone make this set of stories the success that they are. Though the final part of the trilogy is rather unsatisfactory the first two parts are highly successful and highly entertaining. It's also a remarkable look at the rise and fall of one ambitious man and his government. If you are a fan of either political thrillers, British television or both look no further then the House Of Cards trilogy.t is not the thriller the original was and is somewhat less gripping as a result, To Play The King works as something else instead.

B00005JKNF|5.0|The more I chew on `Gosford Park', the more I'm convinced that it may very well be Altman's best film.  Sure, I haven't seen a lot of his films, and some of them I'm not really all too keen on (his style as a director and screenwriter is an acquired taste, and that said style doesn't work all the time), but this film is really, truly impressive all the way around.  The best thing about this film though, is that it ages very well.  The first time I saw this film I merely liked it, but as time goes by the memory of this film only gets better, and with recent viewings it has become apparent to me that this particular social commentary only gets better and better with time.<br /><br />When `Gosford Park' is mentioned, usually the first conversation hinges on the cast, more specifically the large female cast.  I'm going to save them for last.<br /><br />It is 1932 and we are at a large (very large) country house in England.  A group of sophisticated socialites have gathered together for a shooting party, and almost instantaneously the distinctions are made and the parties divide; the wealthy to their lackadaisical meanderings, the servants to their countless duties.  With a twist of `Clue' proportions thrown in, a man (a very prominent figure) shows up dead and just about everyone is suspect.<br /><br />For anyone who has delved into Altman's work, the layered texture of this films script will not come as a shock to you.  From the very beginning of his career, Altman has built his films on a brisk yet complex interchange of dialog.  For me, this film may be the best fit for Altman's use of words, and his ability to capture so much from a mere glimpse of individual communications.  As the LARGE ensemble cast confine themselves in corners, whispering knowledge of one another and trying heartily to solve the mystery themselves, Altman paints a profound and engrossing study of humanity.  As some have mentioned, this film really sinks into the layers of human complexity, fleshing out the motives to our actions, to our words; the very inner workings that move us to action.  It pains me that some dismiss this film without ever really giving it a chance to sink into their minds.<br /><br />I almost did.<br /><br />I'm thrilled that Oscar handed out their screenplay award to this film, for it really is a very complex yet attainable work of art.  The way that Altman breathily moves from character to character, just as the camera swoons in and out of each room, is just breathtaking.  He truly creates real people, and he does so with a tightly woven yet briskly realized collection of conversations that relay the fragility of human frailty without ever losing the earnestness (and humor) needed to create something fresh and entertaining.<br /><br />And now, we get to the ladies.<br /><br />I'm going to start by listing them off.  Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren, Kristen Scott Thomas, Kelly Macdonald and Emily Watson.  Those are just your big names, or recognizable faces, but they really do make the biggest impact.  Mirren and Smith were both Oscar nominated, and they were both outstanding in their respective roles.  Mirren is, without doubt, the better of the two.  Her tortured yet commanding presence perfectly reflects not only her character's social standing (her servitude is very reminiscent of Hopkin's astonishing turn in `The Remains of the Day') but also her inner soul; her person removed from manipulated impressions.  I love what Smith does here (her sudden burst of laughter on the couch is especially pristine) but I never thought she particularly deserved an Oscar nomination for it.  In fact, the fragility of Macdonald's naivety or the inner rumblings of Watson's guilt were, in my opinion, much more deserving of mention.  That said, the only actress here that really can tango with Mirren is Kristen Scott Thomas, the jilted wife and fiery staccato of a woman.  I love the coldness she brings to her every movement, and that sensual awkwardness (there is a lanky stiffness to her movements that I adore, for they instantly create naturalness within her character).  She really understood how to make the most of her screen time.  Now, while she doesn't actually have the emotional punch of Mirren's character, I still feel that Thomas's performance has the slight edge.<br /><br />I would watch her pace a room before I'd watch anyone else.<br /><br />So, in the end I highly recommend this.  I know I toted this as Altman's finest (and I know that the devoted Altman fan may totally fight me on this) but coming from a man who is not an Altman supporter in the definitive sense, I'd say that that statement is pretty solid.  I still fall back and forth between this and `Short Cuts', which is sheer brilliance, but both films are SO different that it is really hard to compare and or judge.  Personally, at this very moment, if I had to chose between the two (as in which film I'd rather sit down and watch right now), I'd go with `Gosford Park'., for they instantly create naturalness within her character).

B00005QBUK|2.0|I can't wear the normal ipod ear buds -- they hurt -- no matter what the brand.  These are great.  They stay in the ear and provide excellent volume and sound.  If I need to wear them unobtrusively, I place the part that normally rests atop the head under my chin.<br /><br />It's the first set of ear phones that my granddaughter was willing to use with a DVD player -- a necessity on 6 hour car trips.<br /><br />They are flimsy and lightweight and disposable when they cost less then $10 a pair.  But at the price now greater than $150, they are not a good buy for the money; they're a waste of money

1401323820|5.0|If you like Castle, you will like the book.  Follows the same format as the show other than name changes and a little more chemistry between the two main characters.  Good read.
0451230620|4.0|If this book isn't one of the features in the book 100 One-Night Reads, it should be. It's a relatively brief novel written near the beginning of King's writing career. King wasn't well known for horror and had even less qualifications for sci fi, yet he does amazingly well at envisioning the sort of \\"Reality TV\\" that could develop in an increasingly jaded and bloodthirsty world. I could not put the book down until I finished it. There aren't many books I can say that about. Contrary to what a few reviewers thought, I enjoyed the movie about as much as the book, and reading the book beforehand didn't seem to dim the excitement for me. A very suspenseful story that grabs and doesn't let go.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|After watching this movie in theaters I immediately wanted to get the soundtrack. The music was wonderful. I came out of the movie recognizing several distinct themes. Of course, the soundtrack was there to show me those themes. In this score Horner does an excellent job of producing music that is deep, emotional, and powerful. Songs like \\"You don't dream in cryo. . . .\\", \\"Shutting down Grace's lab,\\" and \\"Destruction of Hometree\\" were filled with sorrow and depth. These kinds of moving songs are the kind that I look for in a score. When someone can make music that can move you like that, that person deserves recognition.<br />  The songs have a lot of vocal in them, sounding almost foreign. The movie, of course, takes place on another planet so the music reflects something foreign in design, but full of power and sound. I recommend this score heartily by giving it the five-star rating it deserves. If you like variety and emotion in a cd, then this is definitely the soundtrack to get.
0385504225|3.0|First a comment to Gavinstomp-Does something have to be factual and a \\"real science\\" to be in a work of fiction?  Yes, the Institute of Noetic Sciences does exist.  Yes, they are doing on-going experiments.  But there isn't a Katherine Solomon.  Nor is there a lab at the Smithsonian dedicated to such experiments.  You must have really hated the Da Vinci Code because that to was a work of fiction based on a few real people from history!    Ok, now my review.  This was a decent read.  Some parts were better than others, I did find myself wanting to read more in some parts and other parts of the book were a let down.  It did seem like there were parts of the book that just dragged on.  And some parts of the book were typical Dan Brown, the running here and there, getting to a location only to find out they needed to be somewhere else.  But all in all, an enjoyable read.  A bit of a diversion from every day life.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I cannot really add much that hasn't already been said.    It seems to me that a lot of the bad reviews on this CD are people who have forgotten how to just listen and enjoy.  They are too intent on analyzing the thing to death and picking it apart.  It seems that they are not content until they find something they don't like.    I loved 30STM previous CDs because they were so angsty.  I love this CD because is exactly the opposite.     My advice is to close your eyes and just listen.  Absorb it as a whole.  If you don't get chills at least once, there is something wrong with you.
B002VPE1AM|4.0|The movie Avatar is just amazing. In a nutshell it's James Cameron's view of what things look like when a militarily powerful planet (country), earth, discovers a needed commodity on a unsophisticated and relatively peaceful planet-moon (country), Pandora.  This is one of the new generation of movies which feature both live-action and animation in a pleasing mix, and the 3-D goes a long way to enhancing the feel of the action as well as disguising the fact the movie is largely an animated cartoon.  If a critical examination is needed it must start with the recognition the story itself was already old when David v Goliath was written but that hasn't stopped the likes of Shakespeare, James Fennimore Cooper, J.R.R. Tolkein and many others from adding to the pantheon.  Cameron himself directed another version of this same theme in his 1986 Aliens.  Speaking of which Signorney Weaver's and for that matter Giovanni Ribisi's performances here were shadows of their former selves (which is not surprising since their scenes were acted out well away from any 'action' that was later or previously created by the cgi techs), and at least two of the principle characters/voices admitted in interviews they'd taken acting lessons from 7-10 year old nieces and nephews.  Weaver cited her Diane Fossi role as `good training' for her own dual role as an actress and a voice.  In retrospect it is clear Cameron borrowed heavily from his own former work as well as from Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings trilogy and other similar movies.  So what's all the buzz about?  Well, to answer that question one needs to get off the critical high-horse and remember what it felt like in the theater. For my part I had to use my sleeves when my tissue got too soggy, and while I'd probably not be interested in becoming one of the Na'vi and sharing their life on Pandora I heartily applauded Jak Soo Lee of the Jarhead Clan's decision to do so.  `Nother words, Cameron managed as he so often does to weave together a great little story that plucked all the right strings.<br /><br />It must be noted here that I'm reporting on a movie experience, not the dvd version.  I watch movies at 'early bird' matinees during the week which means I usually have the auditorium, the big screen, and the sound system all to myself.  Like having my own, very expensive, private screening room.  I watch home movies on my laptop so the dvd experience is bound to be different.

B002HWRZH0|5.0|I've finally received my copy after pre-ordering in September! My first set got lost in the post but Amazon customer service has been fantastic. They refunded the original delivery cost as it was late then sent me another one, upgraded to priority shipping at no extra cost. This took 3 days to arrive at my door from my email to customer services and meant I didn't have pay any tax or customs charges to import to the UK!    Now for the set. It's fantastic. The quality of the Blu Ray is eye popping and the movie is, of course, awesome. The replica Enterprise is exquisite, a real quality (and heavy!) item. Beautifully machined with a sumptuous brushed finish and subtle black shading to accentuate the details, it has pride of place on my desk. It would be nice if the certificates were numbered, as others have mentioned, but I'm still very happy with my purchase. Well done Amazon.
B001OQCV60|4.0|If one is expecting to see Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's gentleman detective and reluctant side-kick when one attends a showing of Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes they'll be sorely disappointed.  If one has held the view that Doyle's creation was best portrayed in movies by the suave and droll Basil Rathbone and the fumbling, slightly fussy Nigel Bruce, do be prepared for a bit of shake up.  If, however, one has been prepared for a Guy Ritchie extravaganza by viewing Lock, Stock, and Two Smokin' Barrels, or Snatch, then what greats the eye and ear here will be neither shocking nor disappointing.  Casting the smarmy/sleazy Robert Downey Jr. (Natural Born Killers/U.S. Marshals) in the title role, and the always-underplayed Jude Law (Road To Perdition/Gattaca) as the amiable Dr. Watson is one's first clue things are not going to be Doyle-esque, and from the opening scene little doubt can remain.  All of the usual rough stuff one expects from Ritchie is found here, but to his credit the detecting craft which forms the core of a good mystery is not only present but used to a degree guaranteed to keep one's interest through the intermittent smashing-and-bashing scenes. Excellent eye-candy is provided by a pair of femmes, fragile and fatale, with Kelly Reilly taking the former position in the role of Dr. Watson's fianc&eacute;e and Rachel McAdams taking the latter in a role that will keep some guessing to the end (though true Doyle aficionados will early on recognize the man who seems to employ her).  Mark Strong turns in an okay performance as the evil Lord Blackwood and Eddie Marsan does a credible job as the bumbling Lestrade.  The Baker Street Irregulars are notable by their absence.  I can't say anything about the mystery, or more correctly the mysteries-within-mysteries, involved here without revealing too much other than to say this movie ranks high in the 'keep 'em guessing' category.  I'm looking forward to the dvd's release so I can watch it again and again.
0439023491|4.0|After reading The Hunger Games I had really high hopes for Catching Fire but at the same time I was weary. I was right to be, but just barely. The problem lies in that from the very beginning of The Hunger Games to the very last page it's completely 100% action-packed. There's hardly anytime to gain your barrings, you start reading the book one second and the next you're thrust into an adventure that keeps you turning the pages until there's no more pages to turn. Catching Fire isn't like that, it's slower, with a steadier pace that eases you into the story instead of throwing you into it.<br /><br />Most of Catching Fire is information, mostly about the characters that were left back in District 12 when Katniss went into the Games; her mom and her sister, as well as Gale and his mom, and Peeta and his parents. We also learn a lot more about the Capital, the President, Game rituals, as well as how controlling the Capital is of it's citizens, even after the games. This is what the beginning and the middle of the book are made up of, and then the end comes and it's like you've just been shoved off a cliff. There's a huge twist, that is almost predictable, and then directly following there's one that you'd never guess.<br /><br />Catching Fire fell short of the glory The Hunger Games came into but only barely. It's an amazing follow up that still left me turning page after page wondering what was going to happen next. The action is mostly reserved for the last fourth of the book, but it's still very present in little bity pieces throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Overall, it doesn't quite live up to The Hunger Games, but it's still a strong and amazing sequel that left me wanting more and praying for August to get here faster.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|LOL...this was more a comedy than a horror. The guy in the movie cracks me up while the girl is a horrible actor.  The only reason people get scared in this boring movie is because you are constantly left staring at the screen...looking for something to happen....waiting....waiting....hoping not to miss a shadow or a door move.  They try to get you more with anticipation than with horror. I mean, moving doors and scary sounds...big deal? The whole flour incident is stupid. I mean, why would this demon leave footprints, yet remain invisible?  There are 2 cool parts of the movie that are a little surprising and well done as a way to shock you. Besides that, its like watching an after school special on ghosts.  I dont hate it, but its for sure not scary.
0439023483|5.0|When I first heard about The Hunger Games I wanted to read it, but then everyone was reading it, and everyone was liking it, and that scared me. Usually when something is really hyped I tend to pick it apart so much that I can't enjoy it, so I usually just stay away from it. However when I won Catching Fire on twitter, I took it as a sign that I should probably read this, sooner than later. So I went out and bought it, I read it and it was by far my favourite book of 2009.<br /><br />There is not one bad thing I could say about The Hunger Games, it's mostly (a little less if you consider the Gladiatorial Games) completely creative and unique idea that is followed up with one of my favourite leading main characters, with some of the most fantastic writing. What makes The Hunger Games so unique even when taking in the Gladiatorial Games into consideration is the world built around the Games and their \\"players\\". The world building in the Hunger Games is absolutely beyond amazing, other than the fact that where each district is actually located is a bit confusing to me, you can still see them all, and by the end of the book I can almost guarantee you'll even know each districts main source of income. The technology presented in The Hunger Games was in no way available back when the Gladiatorial Games were around, as well as the ever changing arena's the \\"players\\" are faced with. Suzanne Collins writes with the ability to keep you on the edge of your seat by giving you little by little, while still giving you so much. I was constantly wondering what was going to happen next, what was going to pop out around the corner, and whose face was going to show up in the sky each night.<br /><br />Also, as mentioned before I think that Katniss is probably by far one of my favourite female protagonists, ever. She has the ability to be stubborn, smart, strong, vibrant, all at once, as well as flawed, which is something that a lot of authors tend to leave out when writing strong willed females. None of us are without our flaws so it makes no sense to read about a character who is flawless, and in that way you end up loving Katniss even more for her flaws. A big debate among the The Hunger Games and Catching Fire fans is Team Peeta/Gale, and while I have forever put myself on Team Gale, it's hard after reading The Hunger Games to not swear your devotion to Peeta. He is a very kind and gentle person with a strong resolve and a heart of stone, he is the perfect countering character for Katniss, they very much complete each other.<br /><br />Overall The Hunger Games is an absolute thrilling ride of a completely unique idea, with amazing characters and some of the best writing I've had the pleasure of reading.of us are without our flaws so it makes no sense to read about a character who is flawless, and in that way you end up loving Katniss even more for her flaws.

B001P06GX4|3.0|got this game due to all the great reviews, but i dont recall reading anything about how much fun its not with only 3 people, youngest still at home and we still enjoy playing games but not to happy with this one with only 3 players, you need to use all 4 colors splitting the last color between the 3 of us, and its just not as fun as it is for 4, and we dont always have that 4th player, so while only 3 are going to be playing, we go to some of our other favorites.

B001USHRCK|4.0|I received this as a Christmas present because I've always been a fan of the Lego Castle sets, at one time owning many of the original \\"Knights\\" sets and Lego-women and men figurines. But as a little tyke, I threw my toys around and usually separated pieces from sets and combined them with others to make godless monstrosities that I'd play with in the bath tub. And then I just flat out lost most of those sets because I was very irresponsible at the age of 7. Now as a 22-year-old man-child, I can appreciate great Lego sets, like the Star Wars Death Star, to name one.<br /><br />This set was comprised of many small pieces, separated by size, which left it confusing to search for the right piece among building pieces from different instructions. I started on book one, and most of the pieces it asked for were in bags with pieces for book two, which left me searching for one specific piece for uhh..maybe? an hour! I finally had to organize pieces by color and shape (4+ long blocks, red in this pile, 3-2 block pieces, red, and many other colors-following, these separate piles) until I was able to really start on the construction. I guess I'm spoiled by the Lego sets that come organized by what section of the whole construction you are doing (numbering on the bags) where only these pieces from this portion of the construction are in this bag and as follows. A little discourteous that Lego can't follow one piece-organization technique...<br /><br />This set is very durable on the upside, just as long as you're handling the final product. The individual bags and combination of pieces in these bags were a nuisance. I, was thankfully, able to transport the final product down to my basement without it falling apart, so the buildings and mercantile stands all have a sturdy design. And the set finished looks extraordinary as a set piece for a room or various other methods for display. You also get quite a few limited edition characters, like the squire and the two lovely lady figurines. Even livestock like chickens, a crow - which isn't livestock, neither is the chickens - and cows! Overall a great set, just a hassle to put together, even so more than the kingdom set.estock like chickens, a crow - which isn't livestock, neither is the chickens - and cows!

B00275EGWY|5.0|The Hurt Locker opens with a quote; \\"the rush of battle is often a potent and lethal addiction, for war is a drug.\\" Kathryn Bigelow's film is probably the most acclaimed film of the year, ending up on many critics' top 10 lists, with Roger Ebert going so far as to call it the 2nd best film of the decade. When a film receives such monumental acclaim, it's hard to imagine it living up to expectations and you will find those who have already called The Hurt Locker overrated and disappointing...I was skeptical, I'll admit, but The Hurt Locker delivers.    Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are part of a bomb-defusing squad in Baghdad. In the beautifully filmed, poetic opening scene their sergeant (Guy Pearce) is killed when a bomb goes off. SSgt. William James (Jeremy Renner) is brought in to replace him. Sanborn and Eldridge notice immediately that James is more reckless than their previous technician and he has no reservations about it. He's not cocky, but he knows he's good at his job...Even when he's putting both himself and his team in more danger than necessary.    Some familiar faces pop up for brief appearances, actors like David Morse and Ralph Fiennes but the film is owned by Renner and Mackie. The acting in this film has been raved about, but this acclaim has been muffled with more focus being cast on the film as a whole and its female director. This is unfair because both Renner and Mackie carry the film and they both give terrific performances. The acting here is subtle; these are not powerhouse, fishing for an Oscar-type performances. It's the subtlety of the performances, the tapping into real people rather than characters that make these performances great. Renner, especially, nails his role as the adrenaline junkie. Here's an actor that once made Jeffrey Dahmer a sympathetic character and here he really brings you into the mind of James, showing how he thrives on his job rather than just presenting this to you. Bothactors breathe so much life into their characters, they rarely let you in on the fact that they are acting...Their performances seem real.    In the film industry, the most celebrated directors are almost unanimously male. Kathryn Bigelow has now made her presence known amongst her male colleagues (notably her ex-husband James Cameron, who has also been celebrating the critical and financial success of a \\"small\\" film he made), showing that a woman can handle challenging, powerful material that is typically left to male directors. If she were to win the Best Director Academy Award that she will inevitably be nominated for, she will definitely deserve it.     The Hurt Locker works as an action/suspense film and a character study/human drama simultaneously. It's remarkable that Bigelow has managed to balance it out so well, making a film that will appeal to different people for different reasons. Aside from getting into the mind of its main character, it has some intense scenes of heart-racing action; made even more effective by the very real setting...The film was shot in Jordan, at times only three miles from the Iraqi border. Cinematographer Barry Ackroyd deserves his share of credit, using frenetic, yet coherent filming techniques that adds to the realism without making the film hard to follow. Not being a Hollywood production, The Hurt Locker benefits even further by not being afraid to enter darker places that would have been ignored and/or glossed-over to conform to Hollywood standards.     I've never been big on war movies, but The Hurt Locker completely exceeded my expectations. It's a great film, easily one of the best of 2009 and it's hard to imagine another film about the Iraq war topping this in scope, entertainment value, or relevance. This film is not just a flash in the pan either and I think that it will continue to gather more acclaim as the years pass. It's a true masterpiece; poetic, exciting, and memorable.    GRADE: A
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was a cross between of a margaret atwood novel and the gladiator movie. Katniss is just like any other teenage girl but hunts and feeds her family- her mom and sister. It is in the future after a great war has occurred, and there are 12 districts ... well 13 actually, before the rebellion. Every yearthe Capitol hosts the hunger games, a gruesome game of survival andtrust. A boy and a girl are chosen from each district between the ages 12-18. Till only one is left standing, all 24 of them fight to survive. This year is different, her sister Prim is put into the lottery of entering the hunger games, and she gets picked. Fortunately Katniss can tak eher place. As you enter the world of the hunger games your heart will race and your palms will sweat. After this, you`ll be hungry for more.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|I was incredibly charmed by Norah Jones' 2002 debut album \\"Come Away WIth me\\", which seemingly came  out of nowhere and took a lot of people by surprise. Since then, not so much. Despite claims then that she wanted her next album to \\"rock out\\", 2004's \\"Feels Like Home\\" was all-but a carbon copy of the debut album, and 2007's \\"Not Too Late\\" was also in the same vein, stagnant, period. However, since that album, Norah broke up with her long-time boyfriend (and bassist and co-writer) Lee Alexander. So this is the \\"break-up\\" album, which features a new band, and a new attitude.<br /><br />\\"The Fall\\" (13 tracks; 46 min.) starts off with an immediately catchy \\"Chasing Pirates\\", which is followed by an equally fine \\"Even Though\\" and then \\"Light As a Feather\\" (co-written with Ryan Adams), perhaps the best tune on the album. What a great 1-2-3 punch to start the album. After a couple of low-key tunes, \\"It's Gonna Be\\" kicks it up a notch. A rueful \\"You've Ruined Me\\" follows, leading eventually to the other stand-out track for me here, \\"Stuck\\" (co-written with Will Sheff of Okkervil River). The album drags a bit towards the end for me and it would've been better served by cutting 1 or 2 songs.<br /><br />But in all, this is easily Norah's best album since \\"Come Away With Me\\", reminding me at times of Fiona Apple and Miranda Lee Richards. That said, to those reviewers that call this a \\"rock\\" album, really? Kings of Leon are rockers, Norah is not. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but let's keep it real. I saw Norah in concert in 2002 (opening for some other band), just as \\"Come Away With Me\\" was getting bigger and bigger. Where have the years gone?
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon is not a band for the casual listener.  They're not something you can throw on while you do your homework.  You need to listen, pay attention, explore the depths of the music with your mind.  All of the tracks on Crack the Skye are amazing when they stand apart, but if listened to in order, at one time, they become something otherworldly.  I didn't even know it was possible to create such an emotional atmosphere with music.  They draw on the intelligence of classic rock from the 60's and 70's, while still keeping the music heavy and harsh enough to satisfy their heavy metal crowd.  But expressing Crack the Skye as some kind of balancing act aimed at crowd pleasing would be a mistake.  This album is and always will be the epitome of Mastodon flexing their personal creative muscle.  The riffing is almost as if Pink Floyd or ELP were to mash with classic heavy metal like Black Sabbath or Dio.  It's psychedelically trippy at one moment and then crunchy and harsh the next, and none of it seems phoned in.  Brent Hinds and Troy Sanders use harmony and vocal switches to keep the singing fresh, and Hinds comes in with some screaming blue-inspired guitar solos at peaking moments in songs.  The songwriting itself is also Mastodon at their best.  While the lyrics in Blood Mountain did a good enough job of conveying imagination and fantastical situations, their disjointed nature wasn't exactly the best for telling a story.  That has all been fixed.  The lyrics in Crack the Skye are fluid enough to convey the story while still ambiguous enough for your own interpretations to factor in.  Everything just reeks of perfection.      So I say again: sit down (preferably with the lyrics handy), make sure the songs are in the right order, and let her rip.  One sitting, whole album.  You'll be glad you did.

All anyone heard was a splash, and that was good enough for everyone!!!  I mean, come On!!!  How hard would it be to find a body in a quarry!  This blew the entire thing for me. This goes beyond suspending disbelief. This is just stupid writing, and it shows laziness, as well as a lack of respect for the intelligence of the audience, but after seeing how many glowing reviews have been posted, I realize that they must have assumed correctly.
0385523904|5.0|\\"Nothing to Envy\\" is a book I'd like to force any American who mouths off that the US is or is becoming a dictatorship and that Obama (or Bush before him) is ruining or has ruined the country.

The level of suffering that the North Koreans endured makes me think of that which the city of Leningrad suffered during World War II during the epic 900 day siege by the Nazis.<br /><br />The only thing that's missing from the parallel situation (widespread starvation, brutal regime, unbelievable agony and repression) is that the North Koreans have inflicted all of this on themselves.  No one was shooting at them.  But instead of that burden, the North Koreans get to endure the psychological one in which --even with people dropping dead in the streets-- they are repeatedly told that they \\"lucky\\" to live in the paradise of North Korea.<br /><br />All of the ordinary lives that the author chronicles are compelling.  I think the ones that are particularly wrenching are the ones of the woman who Demick calls \\"the true believer\\" because she was such a committed Communist despite the mounting horror that became everyday life during the \\"Arduous March\\" (the euphemism for the famine) and the young man and his girlfriend who met and fell in love amidst all the darkness they were in.  I'm glad that all of them made it out, and I can only pray that the rotten, evil, criminally incompetent \\"paradise\\" of North Korea crumbles into dust some day.<br /><br />***<br /><br />I will close this review with a comment similar to Zola's \\"jaccuse\\" I accuse the American left with being completely AWOL on the plight of the North Koreans.  Every morning, I listen to Pacifica Net radio when I drive to work.  The station features the topic of oppression and tyranny all the time.  But I haven't once heard them (or anyone else in the American progressive and leftist camp) condemn what's been going on in North Korea.  Instead, I just hear the occasional bleating that \\"we must engage with the North Koreans,\\" something that people on the left scorned when the Reagan Administration promoted a policy of constructive engagement with the Apartheid regime in South Africa.  And I hear a lot of metaphorical tears shed for the Palestinians in Gaza, but I hear very few shed for the North Koreans.  Maybe it's because North Korea is such a grotesque caricature of what people on the left hold in esteem...that it's embarrassing to talk about and more fun to attack allies of the United States instead of enemies.of North Korea crumbles into dust some day.    ***    I will close this review with a comment similar to Zola's \\"jaccuse\\" I accuse the American left with being completely AWOL on the plight of the North Koreans.

B000DWMN2S|4.0|I've yet to read the book (of the same title) by Jonathan Safran Foer, but I found this movie adaptation directed by Liev Schreiber (who has been in several Holocaust-themed dramas, such as \\"Jakob the Liar\\" and most recently \\"Defiance\\") to be engrossing and entertaining with a blend of both the comic and tragic. This is quite impressive considering the movie marks Schreiber's directorial debut.<br /><br />The story centers around a young Jewish man, Jonathan Safran Foer (played by Elijah Wood) who has a penchant for collecting things in little ziploc bags, ranging from the ordinary to the truly bizarre(his grandmother's dentures). This obsessive collecting is due to his fear of forgetting the past, and when his dying grandmother passes him two keepsakes that belonged to his deceased grandfather, Jonathan decides to travel to Odessa, Ukraine in an attempt to discover his grandfather's past. One of these keepsakes is a picture with his grandfather Safran and a young woman who apparently saved Safran from the Nazis during WW II.  To aid him on his quest, Jonathan hires two guides, Alexander Perchov (Eugene Hutz in a brilliant performance) who is obsessed with Michael Jackson, and his grouchy and anti-Semitic grandfather (Boris Laskin who also delivers a powerful performance). Grandpa has a psychotic dog named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (go figure) and the trio proceed on their journey - destination is Trachimbrod, which used to be a Jewish shtetl.<br /><br />Most of the movie focuses on the road trip and is quite hilarious, especially in watching the dynamics of three very different people travelling together. Grandpa's virulent anti-Semitism is softened by Alex's creative translation efforts (since Grandpa only speaks Ukrainian, Jonathan relies on Alex to translate for him). I could not help but laugh out loud at Alex's overzealous attempts at speaking English - \\"Do you repose?\\" he asks Jonathan, eliciting a sort of \\"huh\\" response until  Jonathan figures out he means \\"sleeping\\"!  The last third of the movie focuses on what happens to the trip after they finally find a home in the countryside where an old woman (Laryssa Lauret) helps Jonathan find some closure. There are also some interesting twists in the story at this point, with some startling revelations.<br /><br />I found this a refreshing Holocaust-themed drama. The Holocaust by its very subject matter is hard to depict on screen without resorting to the usual depictions of stomach-churning brutality (as evidenced by dramas like \\"Schindler's List\\", \\"The Grey Zone\\", \\"War and Remembrance\\", and \\"Holocaust\\", amongst others). In \\"Everything Is Illuminated\\" there is a balance between the tragic and the comic, and even the flashbacks to the past involving violence is subtly done. The focal point here is not so much the horrors of the Holocaust but of people searching for closure and making peace with events of the past. The strong cast makes this an above-average film, delivering credible and compelling performances. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the lush beauty of the countryside. The DVD itself contains no bonus worth mentioning (just some deleted scenes and a trailer). Final verdict - compelling and engaging drama.d of the movie focuses on what happens to the trip after they finally find a home in the countryside where an old woman (Laryssa Lauret) helps Jonathan find some closure.

B00005JLKB|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />\\"Smallville\\" is the first superhero science fiction show I actually have become enthralled with to the point of watching every week.  A creative spin on the world-famous \\"Superman\\" legend, it expertly mixes fantastical elements with realistic coming-of-age themes and storylines and boasts one of the finest young casts on television.<br /><br />In this first season of the CW series, the principal cast is comprised of Tom Welling as Clark Kent, Kristin Kreuk as Lana Lang, Michael Rosenbaum as Lex Luthor, Sam Jones III as Pete Ross, Allison Mack as Chloe Sullivan, Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, and John Schneider as well as Annette O'Toole as Johnathan and Martha Kent, respectively.  Additionally, a very important recurring guest star this season is John Glover as Lionel Luthor, Lex's cold, controlling and monstrous father.  Throughout this season the cast works well together, with the possible exception of Eric Johnson whose character struggles to find an interesting season-long storyline.<br /><br />Michael Rosenbaum's Lex Luthor is worth the price of admission by itself.  From an acting standpoint, Mr. Rosenbaum's performance would be worthy of an Oscar if he were on the big screen. Additionally, the writing for Lex is exceptional, as in the \\"Smallville\\" storyline he is a best friend to Clark Kent, but doomed to become his blood enemy.  The creativity and emotional complexity surrounding the Luthors and their relationships to themselves and others gives this series suspense for many years as well as an angle of storytelling maturity.<br /><br />The pilot episode of this series is one of the best pilots I've ever seen of any show.  It introduces characters, and sets events in motion on a huge scale with a catastrophic occurrence which reverberates for the rest of the series.  The special effects are cinematic, and announce that the show intends to divorce itself from the well-meaning cheese that doomed previous attempts to bring superheroes to the small screen.<br /><br />\\"Smallville\\" displays maturity, class, and truly compelling storyines.  Pick up this first season if you have not given it a shot.

You hate the guy so much it is heartbreaking to see him continue on, but I guess that says a lot about Ms Hobb's ability to create a despicable character.  I find myself taking the book a little too seriously.

B0000A02TZ|4.0|Animal House is the kind of movie that nearly everyone can laugh at - many against their will. The humor is far from sophisticated but proudly so - and just watch those who normally claim to turn their proverbial nose up at such things struggle to contain laughter. The film is so well-known that it certainly needs no introduction from me; suffice it to say it is one of the few mega hit comedies still as funny as ever after three decades.    It is also significant for many other reasons, not least in being the launching pad for many people and things. Animal House was the first National Lampoon film, establishing a franchise that remains successful despite perhaps never equaling this. More obviously, it was the first successful film - or even the first film period - for nearly everyone involved:  actors, director, writers, producers, etc. Most of them have gone on to notable and varied careers, but Animal House remains among their high points. Everyone rightly praises John Belushi's work here, and this is the movie that made him a household name, but to me the standout performance is John Vernon as the Dean, which is one of the great comic portrayals ever. The movie had an enormous influence on later comedies in every aspect from the college setting to the music, which was a radical departure in being fully serious. Animal House has been often imitated but, fans agree, never equaled.     However, the most notable aspect may be how vividly and realistically this portrays the college experience for many, especially men. The film was released in 1978 and is set in 1962, but its spirit crosses generations. College freshmen today can relate nearly as strongly as those originally targeted. It always makes a great gift for a college student and has strong potential to bring various generations together. Aside from those who just do not like - or will not admit to liking - the humor, some may scoff that the film sanctions traditionally immoral behavior and glorifies fraternity boys, hardly the proverbial role models for ever-tormented youth. However, we must all realize this is after all a comedy and meant in good fun. Besides, who can deny its general accuracy? The truth is always valuable, however much we may like to deny it.    The various reissues have a very generous amount of bonus material, making a purchase worthwhile even for those who have seen the film many times. Standard material - comments, trailer, cast/crew biographies, etc. - aside, there is a roughly thirty minute mockumentary featuring much of the original cast in character. It is a hilarious \\"Where Are They Now?\\" spoof following up on the final segment showing where many of the characters ended up. The comedy is very much in the spirit of the film, and long-time fans will love it. There is also a lengthy straight documentary featuring interviews with the actors as well as much of the crew. It gives much interesting information about the inspiration behind the movie as well as the making of it, reaction to it, and aftereffects, while also managing to be frequently entertaining. Make sure the edition you buy or rent has these; the Double Secret Probation Edition does, as does the 30th Anniversary Edition. This lets those who have long loved the film appreciate it anew, while those who still have not seen it have even less excuse than ever for continuing to wait.
B0030LLAFU|5.0|All around Goemon is SUCH a thrill to watch. I was still thinking about it days after I saw it. I'm actually really excited to show all my friends.    The story of Goemon is actually that of folklore, and one that doesn't really give too much information about his life. There are some Japanese (I believe) plays about him, but this movie gives a whole new viewpoint on the Goemon lore. I don't wanna spoil it because half of the fun is the story itself.  This movie, on a viewing level, is INcredible! The special effects look superb (a little more superior than in Casshern), the action is well-thought out, the camera angles and directing are clever and fluid, the costumes and backgrounds really put you in the mood of the given scene and overall movie, etc.    I haven't seen such a good movie in a while. Definitely worth adding to your collection. The acting is top notch, and the visuals keep you attracted to the movie all the way to the touching end (and it won't be anything you would expect). I thought the movie ended 5 times over (i'm exagerating) before it actually ended, so I'm guessing it was about a 2 hour movie. PLEASE check it out and spread the word. Great movies like this should be more known.    I don't know what a \\"prefect\\" movie is or would be...but I have to say there was nothing wrong with this movie in my mind and I wouldn't have changed a THING! 10 out of 10 points for me! Enjoy.
B00011CZRE|4.0|Seven is one of the best cinematic thrillers, especially of the last few decades - almost a blueprint of how one should be. Where nearly all of them fail, becoming clichéd, predictable, and implausible, it succeeds. It continuously defies expectations - in a good way -, subtly making us think it is going one way then going another. This quickly becomes clear, as the opening premise seems distinctly hackneyed - a veteran, retiring detective gets a cocky upstart partner for his last case, which turns out to be by far their most difficult. This has been done so many times that it hurts, but this is something different. What could have easily been unbearably banal turns out to be surprisingly and refreshingly interesting, as the relationship develops with unexpected subtlety.    What really makes Seven stand out from all the films with similar premises, though, is the villain - easily the most disturbing cinematic killer since The Silence of the Lambs. His methods and motives are unusual and deeply frightening - painstakingly methodical and sadistic. Even more interestingly, he is deeply, self-righteously, and thus hypocritically religious and plans his mayhem accordingly.    This brings up one of the film's true strengths - Andrew Kevin Walker's script. One of the freshest screenplays in modern film, it continually surprises without being contrived. Walker's work is really quite tight; those looking for plot holes will have an unusually hard time, and any that can be found are minor. The dialogue is also above average. Having the killer base his murders - nay, his whole existence - on the seven deadly sins is a novel and perversely fascinating concept. More importantly, it leads to many theological elements and aspects of religious history throughout all aspects of the movie. One would be very hard-pressed to find a thriller where such weighty issues are so seamlessly integral to the plot. Those unfamiliar with such elements will learn much, especially as the script fortunately never becomes preachy or overly didactic. Even more impressive are the litany of literary references. Nearly every movie seems to throw in a Shakespeare reference or something to seem intelligent, but this is actually well done. There are about as many allusions as a mainstream film can get away with, and in contrast to nearly every movie that tries to do such a thing even with far less ambition, it never seems forced. The allusions are important to the plot and spice up the dialogue while giving viewers some substantial meat to chew between all the suspense.    This raises an important question - just how good is the script? How serious and how ambitious? That Seven currently ranks #27 on the Internet Movie Database's list of the 250 Best Films of All-Time strongly suggests many see far more than just a thriller. It is certainly true that Seven raises numerous important issues, from theological niceties to practical aspects of crime fighting. It also dramatizes many important themes, including modern crime, urban decay, institutional and individual responsibility toward society, apathy vs. activism, youth vs. age, experience vs. emotion, etc. Some weighty philosophical issues are even brought up and, more to the point, we see much about the often vast gap between theory and practice. Seven vividly dramatizes the ticklish problem of applying hard-won wisdom to the modern world's cold reality. Most noteworthy to me is the acidic religious criticism that nearly everyone, including the film's biggest fans, seems to have missed. Seven is a vicious shot at hypocritical religious self-righteousness and does much to expose Christianity, especially its historical bases, as hollow. If the many who have seen this film - especially the many who seem to think it a masterpiece - realized this, the world might have been slightly bettered. Unfortunately, as all too often in such cases, it has not even been ignored but simply gone unseen.    The regrettable situation hasundoubtedly arisen because the movie is essentially a thriller; heavier elements work within this framework rather than the reverse. Many go into it expecting a thriller and see just that - and it is quite good on such terms. However, this can easily make them fail to see the weightier elements. Those alive to them will quickly see that, while they move the film above a mere thriller, the genre's inherent limitations keep it from true greatness. There is a sense, then, in which Seven is overrated. It is certainly not one of the thirty greatest films, and I am unable to imagine how it acquired such a status. This is unfortunate, really, because it is very good on its own terms and more than respectable per se; it would truly be a shame if people were disappointed because they expected a masterwork. If the more substantial elements were actually the core and all thriller conventions were dropped, this could truly be a masterpiece. That it limits itself in this way should not necessarily be held against it; Seven is about as good as a film can be that is not trying for true mastery. This may disappoint those looking for the transcendentally great, but the discerning among those who expect only a thriller may well be pleasantly surprised.    The daringly dark ending is the clearest sign of how Seven refuses to limit itself to thriller conventions entirely. An essentially happy conclusion is one of the main thriller conventions, something most viewers want and expect. No matter how many close scrapes protagonists go through, they are supposed to triumph. Seven crushes this cliché with a highly pessimistic ending that is gut-wrenchingly shocking yet inevitable; it refrains from a cheap twist and is certainly without trite sentimentality. It is sad but unsurprising that New Line wanted to change this. Several alternate endings were proposed, all inferior mainly because they made the players act out of character or otherwise introduced implausibility. The cast and crew fought for the original ending and thankfully won; Seven's status as something more than thriller would be highly compromised without it.    Masterpiece or not, several Seven aspects are clearly excellent. The most obvious is the acting. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman do a thorough job of portraying the detectives and work well together. Some have questioned the former's job, especially toward the end, but their real problem seems to be with the character. One may not like Mills or his behavior, but this is hardly the fault of Pitt, who is more than adequate. Freeman meanwhile performs with his usual excellence, vividly portraying a character with a lot of depth and even somehow managing to make him very likable. He is almost like an African American Sherlock Holmes. However, Kevin Spacey's as the villain is the true highlight. It is doubtful that anyone else could have pulled off such a brilliant portrayal. His John Doe is fully detestable - twisted, vain, hypocritical, and more - yet we can see the great, if perverse, intellect and talent behind the evil. Spacey pushed to have his name kept from the opening credits, and his late appearance is indeed exhilarating. It was all the more notable given his recent, Oscar-winning role as a villain in The Usual Suspects. That was a rightly proclaimed performance, but this is even better - one of the more astonishing depictions in recent memory. As for Gwyneth Paltrow's small role, I have heard that she was not interested in it and had to be convinced to take it. I can see why; she is simply not believable as a fifth grade teacher and worried wife/expectant mother. It is perhaps not her fault exactly; she is who she is and was wrongly cast. One can understand why Pitt would want his then-girlfriend to play his wife, but a better choice could clearly have been made. However, this inadequate performance in a minor role does little to mar what is otherwise an excellently acted picture.    Director David Fincher does a good job inall areas, particularly cinematography. Seven is very atmospheric without resorting to film noir clichés; the ambiance is so strong that much of what would normally need to be explicated in dialogue can remain unsaid. Fincher keeps the suspense riding high, milking the mystery for drama but not letting it go dry. The film seems to have a slow start, but we soon see this is deliberate and right. The various red herrings are also well-done - effective without being cheap. Finally, the music is commendable and does a good job of setting the mood. It is easy to see why this made Fincher's name as a director.     In summary, Seven is at least worth a rental to those who still have not seen it. As for which edition to buy, the single disc version is truly bare bones. Anyone wanting extras should seek out the various expanded editions, but those who just want a permanent copy will be fine with the single disc, as it does not cost much more than a rental. Whichever route one chooses, the film comes quite highly recommended.

B000005RFQ|4.0|After Ozzy Osbourne was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979, Ronnie James Dio of Rainbow took over the job of lead vocalist for Black Sabbath.  After his departure, Deep Purple's Ian Gillan was hired and the end result was the only album from the Gillan era, Born Again (1983).  This album has gotten mixed reviews over the years, but it's a solid album.  While Gillan's lyrics aren't as dark as the band's earlier lyrics, this album does manage to have a dark sound on most of the tracks.  Gillan does a great job as lead vocalist.  Some people think his style of singing is almost blues-like on this album, but I find that his voice fits the music well, especially on the title track Born Again.  Tony Iommi provides some of his best guitar work on this album.  This album has some good tracks.  Keep It Warm is another favorite of mine.<br /><br />If you're open minded when it comes to Black Sabbath without Ozzy as their lead singer, then listen to Ian Gillan on Born Again.  I personally think it was one of the band's better moments.  I highly recommend this album.
B001FB55I0|2.0|This review is for the unrated extended blu-ray version. Plenty of spoilers so read at your own discretion. Although, my expectations for this movie were pretty low to begin with, since the movie wasn't directed by James Cameron and T3 wasn't as good as T2, I was at least expecting something that would extend the terminator storyline and mythology from the television show The Sarah Connor Chronicles (which was an excellent TV series) and from the comics. Unfortunately, the people who wrote the script for this movie and the director, McG are completely ignorant and clueless when it comes to the entire Terminator canon. Nothing in this movie makes any sense when you consider the previous three films. It's like these people just threw out everything from the first three films and then started making up stuff as they went along without any thought into what came before or the history that Cameron created.     First, in this movie the machines all know who John Connor is which makes no sense if you follow the history. The audience is so used to the idea that Skynet knows all about Connor that this error usually passes over them without any thought, but what they forget is that only the machines from the future know who Connor is and only because of what he WILL accomplish in the future. He hasn't done ANYTHING yet. All the terminators from the previous films were from the future while the machines in this movie are in the present. The machines have just wiped out most of humanity and now sees them nothing more than a bunch of insects to finish exterminating. Connor at this point is just another insect so this idea that he is somehow important to them is ludicrous. Don't give me this crap about him being seen as a prophecy or messiah either.    Second mistake is that the machines all know who Kyle Reese is which provides one of the biggest plot holes in this movie and goes against even common sense. The entire purpose of the first movie was that the machines didn't know who the father was so their only alternative was to terminate the mother which is why they built the damn time machine in the first place, in order to wipe out his entire existence. In fact information about the father was so secretive that not even Kyle Reese knew it. If the machines know who Kyle Reese is then why the hell would they even bother building the time machine when Connor's very existence depends on it? How the hell are they going to explain that in future sequels if there will be one? This is a massive disaster of a plot hole that can't be overlooked and can't be explained. It's idiotic. And don't give me this crap about alternate timelines or other theories on time travel that's different from the one used in Back to the Future. The rules of time travel and the theory used from the first trilogy have already been in place which is the Back to the Future scenario so you just don't make up new rules and change the canon to suit your logic. That's similar to that idiotic scene from AVP Requiem when the Predalien lays eggs inside pregnant women for the sole purpose of increasing the alien infestation. Only the damn queen lays eggs, stupid! And that still wouldn't explain why Skynet builds the time machine in the future either!     Third plothole is when Skynet captures Kyle Reese they don't decide to execute him right then and there but instead have some kind of elaborate plot in order to lure Connor to execute him. Does this make any sense? What the hell was McG (what the hell kind of name is this) and the writers thinking when they came to this scene? Forget about your stupid theories on time travel when you can't apply it here (see second plot hole). This is so blatantly stupid that words can't describe the idiocy behind it. Who writes this stuff and not see the inherent problems with it?    Fourth problem was when Connor arrives the T800, instead of breaking Connor's neck decides to play ball with him by throwing him around. I thought T800s have detailed files on human anatomy and how to efficiently terminate humans. You'd think that having their biggest sought out target within their grasp they'd kill him as quickly as possible and with a gun instead of a naked unarmed Arnold.     Fifth problem comes at the end when they need to do a heart transplant on John, using Marcus's heart. This scene was supposedly changed due to leakage of the original script but it still doesn't excuse it's sloppiness. This scene requires that Marcus is an acceptable donor, plenty of immunosuppressive drugs, a heart surgeon and a team of anesthetics and not a veterinarian, and a sterile environment instead of the open desert. I was cringing at this scene and thank God it didn't last very long.     Now as for the movie itself, if you are completely ignorant of the previous three films this movie would be somewhat entertaining for the action scenes alone which were very thrilling. But the audience doesn't really care about any of the characters except for maybe Marcus so the movie become nothing more than one action set piece after another. There's really no character development or insight into who these people are and why we should care about them. What made T2 and other movies like it so successful is that we get to know the characters where the audience have an emotional investment so we are concerned about them and anxiously curious about what will happen next. The action is there to supplant the characters not drive them. This movie should have been about how John Connor becomes leader of the Resistance and help humanity come back from the brink of extinction instead of this goofball storyline filled with plot holes. I won't bother going into the special features on the blu-ray or the deleted scenes which have already been discussed. I'll just add that the video transfer is impeccable and the audio is excellent as well and is what is expected from blu-ray by now.     In conclusion, if you are expecting forgetful mindless action, explosions with killer robots, and don't necessarily care about character development or plot then this movie is adequate. But if you are a fan of the terminator franchise then you will be sorely disappointed from the glaring plot holes, mistakes, and literal lack of respect for the mythology and the fan base. It's comparable to George Lucas using midichlorians to explain the Force. Much like having top tiered actors in The Phantom Menace, not even Christian Bale aka Batman can save this turkey. Time to terminate this franchise or return it back to Cameron.

B002QH2NUA|4.0|In July 2009 Paul McCartney took to the stage to open New York's Citi Field and for two and one half hours showed that he can still work his magic. Playing with a five member band he worked his way through some new material, quite a bit of the Beatles catalogue and a few Wings staples.    Some may quibble that Sir Paul has used auto-tune software to smoothe out his voice. This may or may not be the case but the show is not to be missed. The Beatles played Shea Stadium in 1965 and this show is a return engagement of sorts at least as far as the music was concerned.    The DVD is packaged with a two CD recording of the full first night show. For less than twenty bucks this is one concert experience that should not be missed.
B0000A1HQP|4.0|Yes, sadly, I did laugh a great deal.  The slapstick and buffoonery were spot on.

Perhaps all sharp lessons should be delivered this cleverly.
B002UNMWAG|4.0|...have no idea why we all love em so damn much.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to see 'All Saints Day' in the theater, it was on a limited release and luckily they did not forget the mid-west fans all together.<br /><br />Did the movie have some plot issues, yes<br />Did the movie have some acting and directing issues, yes<br />and finally was it the best movie I have ever seen...no<br /><br />However, it was a funny, entertaining, enjoying, sometimes beautifully done movie that I would have loved to see more on the big screen. At today's prices, having to drive 40 miles one way and it only being there for a short run kept me from going back a few more times.<br /><br />I cannot comment on the BluRay as it has not been released as of this writing, few months away yet. My best advice is for you to buy, rent, steal the first movie and after you watch it you will know which side of the fence you are on.<br /><br />I look forward to the outtake reel and seeing how many nods to other greats I missed, Spike Lee and Tarantino being two I remember catching.

B0031BAQ5Y|3.0|Inglorious Bastards is funny, fun, exciting, slick, graphic, suspenseful, calculating intense scenes, very politically correct, and gruesome...typically Tarantino stuff. However the movie enters the very, very ludicrous speed in fictional B-movies.  Unfortunately it projects the usual stigma that all Germans during the period were Nazis, without remorse and deserved to die cruelly, unless of course if they were killing German soldiers. Then they die in the movie anyways. Interestingly, the movie does briefly touch upon the doctrine of Social Evolutionary Darwinism which the Socialist Nazis were basing their Reich expansion and cleansing on. This is discoursed in the beginning of the movie as an SS Officer explains it to a French country man who was hiding Jews.        However I can't wait for Tarantino's next Inglorious Bastards installment. The movie has a squad of surviving family members from 911 who joined the U.S. military and are a part of a merciless crew who go into Afghanistan and Pakistan killing any Taliban and Al Qaida they find. The special squad not only scalps the enemy but they rip off their beards. The movie ends when they get to burn to death Osama Bin laden and many of his leader Jihadists but only after spraying them with pig entrails.
0765356147|3.0|If I could choose, I'd perhaps rate this close to 3.5 stars. As a whole, the entire Mistborn series is probably a 4.25 to me. This is because the first book and the universe that it creates is outstanding--Sanderson has borders on genius with his realm creation, and does pretty good with a lot in the series.    However, the last two books have been rather unsatisfying.    I kind of felt like there was too much of \\"stumbling through\\" the plot. At this point in the series, I feel as though most of the mysteries regarding how stuff works in the universe should probably be revealed, and the book should focus more on narrating an exciting adventure. Instead, I felt like reading through the book had a lot of simply getting by pages to understand what is going on, rather than solve whatever it is that needed to be solved.    Randomly selecting a few things that I found problematic: Sazed's religious crisis is a stretch, and didn't seem in-character. While there was some interesting insight in it (realizations regarding hope, trust), it was mostly smothered in the less enjoyable stuff. Also, SPOILER: what happens to Marsh? I'd like to see some resolution here. And why can't we ever find out what the last 2 allomantic metals are? We never find out what makes a boy or girl kandra. I'm not sure I found TenSoon's little romance with the newer generation \\"girl\\" kandra believable. Oh, and it also doesn't make sense that he killed OreSeur, seeming to be one of higher moral integrity (I know thats from book 2).    And I wish that the book was a little less dark. (Not a reason to rate it lower, just a preference)

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I adore this film.  Independent films take chances that mainstream films aren't as willing to do.  Some people are disappointed in this film and find it dull or boring.  That is because it is being promoted as a romatnic comedy and that makes people think it falls in that specific genre and it does not.  Sadly, even on the blu ray case it describes the film as a romantic comedy.  Then one expects the typical boy meets girl, boy looses girl with a very happy ending.<br /><br />The film is actually a deep character study of a man and a woman who meet, form a relationship and the emotional ride they both go on.  It studies very honestly how people have expectations in relationships and that two people can be having very different experiences.  SUMMER named in the title is actually the female role played by Zooey Deschanel and the film very creatively flips from various days in the 500 the couple spend together one to another.  It sounds hokey but it magically works and you will find yourself emotionally invested in these two characters and will relate more to one than the other depending on how you look at love yourself.<br /><br />For me the truly shining piece of this film was Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  He has proven himself a gifted actor with a long list of independent films as well as many mainstream.  He creates a very strong character here, a man who is desperately seeking his soul mate and believes he finds it in Summer.  Following his ups and downs emotionally is a tour de force for Levitt.  Deschanel also shines but the character played by Levitt is more front and center.<br /><br />So this film is not the typical light romantic comedy fare a couple may go to the movies to see on their first date.  This film is a boy meets girl, boy gets girl and boy looses girl film and it is ok to know that for the film is about the emotional journey both characters go through as each of their perceptions of love and relationships are tested.  There are many true laughs here but the situations are funny because you can relate.  So this film is, as I stated, a true character study that delves deeply and honestly into two characters who fall into each others life and learn much about themselves.  I found the film unique, heartfelt and original very creatively put together in a way that better illustrated the emotions being seen.  Kudos to the actors, writers and director.<br /><br />The blu ray version is a delight with beautiful picture displaying vibrant colors and crisp clarity.  The audio is also of the highest quality.

B000YPUF9W|1.0|This is one of those movie series in which it becomes progressively worse with each installment. Not much I can say, but the women are atypical stereotypes of the aggressive females; long on angst and short on acting skills. Laughable plots and more laughable are the actors trying to reach out \\"acting\\". If you like sci-fi action flicks (there are boring sequences), this is pretty good. But don't ever expect Oscar performances in these movies. I guess no one really does.
0930289234|5.0|--for crissakes it's so cold in my office. You'd think we were living back in the days of Dickens. I swear I'm going to put my scarf and gloves on in about ten minutes.<br /><br />Just finished reading Alan Moore's \\"The Watchmen\\" and it far exceeded my expectations, even the lavish praised heaped upon it by the most intelligent people I know, who've urged me to read it for years. One wonders what the world of \\"literature\\" is coming to when you've got to turn to comic books to read something truly edgy, intellectually challenging, and creatively uncompromising. As publishers fill up every inch of available shelf space hoping to make millions with Dan Brown knock-offs--when Dan Brown himself was never worth reading--and an unchecked infestation of paranormal vampire romances spawned by the long-ago success of Laurell Hamilton, it's left to the geeks who write comic books to actually write stuff worth reading.<br /><br />Maybe its because comic books are written (and largely read) by misfits like myself who see the world from the margins, being ourselves only marginal. Well, whatever the reason, \\"The Watchmen\\" is simply a terrific book, a summation, in some ways, of the last half of the 20th century in which concepts such as heroism, patriotism, good and evil, the sanctity and meaning of human life were tossed into the blender and turned into a viscous, stinking goo.<br /><br />Moore does a kind of post-modern critical analysis of the comic-ethos even as he's writing a comic-book. His superheroes are deeply flawed--sometimes downright criminally insane human beings--but they also embarrasedly aware of the absurdity of running around the city at night in cape and underwear catching bad guys. This is just one example of Moore's genius: \\"The Watchmen\\" becomes all the more realistic because the charaters themselves realize how ludicrous it is to truly believe any of it.<br /><br />To say the heroes in \\"The Watchmen\\" are more anti-heroes is true, but it doesn't go quite far enough. They aren't anti-heroes in the same fashion that the updated and more morally ambiguous Batman is an anti-hero. Moore's \\"heroes\\" often lack not only goodness, but grandeur. They're petty, mean-spirited, greedy, opportunistic, and, in one instance, they even smell bad. But not-so-oddly enough, they are trying to do good in their own often wrong-headed way.<br /><br />That, too, is what makes them so real.<br /><br />They are more like the old Olympian gods of Greek mythology in that sense, bickering and scheming, as caught up with their own in-fighting as they are with the human world they are supposedly overseeing.<br /><br />All that aside, Moore's storytelling technique is impressively innovative, as is the layout of Dave Gibbons' visuals. This is graphic storytelling at its finest...well, the finest I can remember seeing. And Moore is obviously a really intelligent guy. His references are broad and his influences eclectic. This is a substantial piece of work that gave me several days of real pleasure--well worth the $19.99 I paid for it.<br /><br />I think I'm going to go outside and warm up.

0446402389|4.0|The first half  of this historical thriller was an amazing bit of enlightenment.  It was totally engrossing, well plotted, believable, and informative.  The characters authentically revealed through art what it is like to be human under certain conditions.    Somewhere in the second half I felt as if I had a flat tire.  The journey which began so smoothly as superior literary art, began to get bumpy, overly co-incidental, and then superficial.  As I closed the final page I felt huge disappointment.  Not for a second do I  want to say the writing is not clever in its unfolding, but it lacked the depth one had experienced in the beginning of the story.    The use of objective pronouns was often a mess.  Maybe I missed the sense of style that the author was communicating, or the tone, but I found the traditional grammar mistakes to be annoying.  Where was the editor?  I admit this may have been a literary device used to communicate something about the characters, but I believe it took away from the flow.      As a first novel, nevertheless, this is a tome worth reading, even with its flaws.  This reader looks forward to more work from this artist, and hopes for continued insight about living behind the Iron Curtain in Russia.      THOMAS PATRICK HULL, CHICAGO
B002HWRYJE|5.0|When the advance publicity declared that this was \\"not your father's Star Trek\\"--or, what's more likely, your mother's (my experience with media fandom being that it is dominated by females)--it was spot-on.  From a very early point in the story, as an infant James Kirk comes squalling into the Universe barely seconds before his Starfleet father is killed crashing his crippled and evacuated starship into a Romulan miner, those of us who know the original series, and remember that Kirk had a brother, realize that something we don't yet understand is going on here.  The fatherless Kirk (who apparently acquires a stepfather at an early point) is a wild, rebellious youngster (Chris Pine) who doesn't enter the Starfleet Academy till he's 22, but when he does he makes good on his boast that he'll ace the four-year course in three.  (He also sabotages the Kobiyashi Maru test and meets its designer, a half-Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto), while going through his training side by side with an older and just-divorced cadet, a young medical doctor named Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban), on whom he bestows the nickname of \\"Bones.\\"  Assigned to the new-minted USS Enterprise under Capt. Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood), he almost loses out on the voyage because of his test-diddling, but gets McCoy to smuggle him onboard--and it's a good thing he does.  I won't spoil the story for you by trying to describe the complex and headlong plot, but let's just say Kirk and the viewer are both in for some surprises.    The Malaysian release of this film was subtitled \\"The Future Begins,\\" and that may well be what its creators had in mind: with the inevitable aging of the original cast (and the deaths of at least two), plus the lack of a current TV entry to the franchise, going back in time may be the best chance Trek has to keep itself in the public eye.  Though Pine doesn't (to me) look very much like a young William Shatner, both Quinto and Urban bear an uncanny resemblance to their original models, and Simon Pegg (Scotty), John Cho (Sulu), and Zoe Saldana (Uhura) were also cast with an eye to the possibility.  The designers of the film have had the good sense to make it look as much as possible like the TV series, but the effects are, of course, about 1000 times better, the action scarcely lets up for a minute, and Michael Giacchino's thunderous music track is absolutely stupendous (don't miss the CD [[ASIN:B001Z920NA Star Trek]]).  At the close we find ourselves wondering whether Kirk and his youthful crew (Anton Yelchin, though he doesn't much resemble Walter Koenig, is a delight as the 17-year-old mathematical whiz kid, helmsman, and Transporter innovater Chekhov) may find a way to go forward in time and change certain aspects of what is now their past.  I'll certainly be watching for future entries in the series.

This is not just a great love story (which, by the way, it is), but an outstanding YA book.

Great dialogues, and the characters are not left behind.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My husband usually finds nature shows to be boring but whenever I would sit down to watch an episode of this series, he was immediately drawn to it. The material was interesting, exciting and beautifully filmed. It was hard to pace ourselves and not finish the boxset within just a few days, although we will definitely be watching the series again and again.     This documentary is moving and makes you look at our amazing planet in a new and different way. You will see animals, many of them rare, doing things never caught on film before. Sometimes this took the film crew several weeks or more to capture. They were very passionate and dedicated to the series and it was fun to watch them at work in the \\"Dairies\\" section after each episode. I now want to share this with the rest of my family because I know they will enjoy it too. For those who have children, it would be an excellent way to educate while entertaining.    We have a horribly outdated television set, but the picture was still amazing. My only gripe was in the first episode, I had a hard time hearing David Attenborough's narration over the loud music and had to turn on the subtitles. I do not think this is any fault in the program, it's probably just the pathetic speakers on our hand-me-down TV. We didn't have a problem with sound in any of the other episodes.

Because the rabbi himself felt that his time was near. Hence, Mitch wrote about life's greatest lesson with him. The quote that really made me memorable from the story is  \\"When you come to the end, that is where God begins.\\" Said Rabbi<br /><br />Of Pastor, it was the story about his struggle to preach the homeless and lived with the hole in the roof church and his story when he had been a drug dealer. The best lesson that i learned from his perspective is  \\" God will not forget his children\\" said Pastor Henry Covington<br /><br />Well, to be honest, this book is a must have for those of you who are curious and confuse about what's life for?

B0000AM6IY|4.0|A classic for almost 50 years, this retelling of Shakespeare's tale of star-crossed lovers is also oddly relevant in a day when street gangs go armed with automatic weapons and mow down innocent bystanders with abandon: the Anglo Jets and Puerto Rican Sharks, who carefully arrange their battle for an isolated location and agree to what amounts to a duel of two champions, seem far superior to their modern analogues.  Riff (Russ Tamblyn), leader of the Jets, has become impatient with the repeated incursions of the Sharks onto his gang's turf--it may be small, but it's theirs, and he plans to keep it that way.  Making up his mind to challenge the Sharks' leader Bernardo (George Chakiris) to a rumble to decide the issue, he asks his friend and foster brother Tony (Richard Beymer) to serve as his backup.  Tony has given up the gang life and gotten a respectable job helping out at Doc's candy store, but he can't say no to Riff--and what's more, he feels that \\"something big\\" is about to come into his life, something he may find at the upcoming dance where Riff plans to issue his challenge.  What he finds is Maria (Natalie Wood), Bernardo's sister, whom he's brought up to New York to marry his friend Chino (Jose deVega).  From the moment the two set eyes on each other, they know their destiny.  But just as the Capulet-Montague feud of 16th-century Verona doomed the original Romeo and Juliet, so ethnic hatreds stand in the way of Tony and Maria's love.    The plot is skilfully adapted from Shakespeare's original, with most of the elements still in place and a couple (particularly the characters of Anita (Rita Moreno), Maria's friend and Bernardo's girl, and Anybodys (Susan Oakes), the crop-haired tomboy who longs to be accepted as a full-blown Jet) added to great effect; even if (like me) you think love at first sight is hooey, you find yourself sucked into the world of the impassioned pair and wanting them to make it out though you know they can't.  But of course the best part of the movie is the songs--the yearning \\"Maria,\\" \\"Somewhere,\\" and \\"One Hand, One Heart,\\" the sardonic \\"America\\" (though I personally think the original Broadway lyrics were better) and \\"Gee, Officer Krupke!,\\" the soaring \\"Tonight\\" (in two versions, a Tony/Maria duet and an intercut ensemble), and the street-smart \\"Jet Song\\" and \\"Cool\\"--and the lively balletic dance numbers (the establishing Jets/Sharks scuffles, the dance at the gym, the Puerto Ricans' mini-fiesta on the apartment roof, and the rumble itself).  This is a true classic of Hollywood musicals and one every fan of the genre should know.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Synopsis:  The movie is set in an alternate history during World War 2.  Shosanna Dreyfus (Mélanie Laurent) retreats to Paris after her family is brutally murdered by the Nazi SS and their leader, Col. Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz.)  She assumes a new identity as a movie house operator when she attracts the attention (and interest) of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Brühl), who wants to use her theater to show a movie filmed about his heroic exploits in the war to high-ranking German officers, including Adolf Hitler himself (Martin Wuttke).  Though she is forced to go through with it, she does so while planning to extract her revenge for her family's murder.  Meanwhile, Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) watches over a group of Jewish-American soldiers who do everything possible to torment the Nazis with their brutal tactics (including scalping the dead and carving swastikas in the heads of survivors.)  They eventually get intelligence about the movie and go to France in an effort to cause mayhem for the Nazis.  Will Shosanna extract her revenge, or will the Nazis figure out her past?  Will Landa and his men thwart the Basterds, or will they succeed in doing their business... which is killing Nazis?    Here's the deal.  I went and saw [[ASIN:B001TUZG4K Valkyrie]] and was disappointed because while the story was one that deserved to be told, it was basically a bunch of American and British actors running around going \\"Oh look, we are ze Germans!\\"  This movie, on the other hand, was a fake story that had casting that was beyond remarkable.  Without the cast that this movie had, it would have either suffered horribly or simply not have made the splash that it made.  I thought Waltz was the perfect choice for the movie's chief antagonist, while Pitt was brilliant as the comedic relief in what would have been an otherwise dramatic film.      In the end, you have the typical elements that successfully make a Tarantino film:  A strong heroine who's getting her revenge, a story broken upin chapters/vignettes, and a combination of acting and cinematography that makes the impossible seem possible.  This one is just as good as any of his other films and I recommend checking it out.

0061689246|4.0|A book of pure fantasy, nice to read, but a little too weird sometimes. There is a movie (Stardust, 2007) which is perhaps not as imaginative, but it softened the sharp edges of the characters, and put a happier ending (hey, this is just my opinion!). Though the story is definitely less predictable and more original in the book, that's for sure. But anyway, Yvaine is too cold, I don't really see how she and Tristan fell in love, and the relationship between  Tristan and Victoria is strange too. However, the fantasy is the one thing that defines the book for real. The ending for the witches was more epic in the movie, but more interesting (stylish?) in the book. And I loved the market scenes and the search for the fallen star.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Two months ago I didn't know this show existed.  Now I'm utterly addicted (and I don't even own a TV--that's hard to do!).  I can't believe Firefly was cancelled after only one season.  The guys who run Fox--or at any rate the ones who made that decision--are demonic morons.  CHECK OUT FIREFLY NOW!!!
B001FB55HQ|1.0|As much hype as this film got, especially the nonsense with Christian Bale berating a lighting guy for causing him to fluff  his dialogue during a scene, it didn't even come close to being half way  decent.    The high hopes Halcyon had for this film fell way short and actually caused their demise, disappointing fans that have eagerly awaited the future war for over twenty years.    The only way this franchise will ever survive is to get back to the original plot basics, bring Cameron back on board, much like Ridley Scot has just done with Alien and give the die hard fans what they want.
817224164X|3.0|First of all I think everybody should read this book. Putting it on a list of forbidden books in many countries will have the opposite effect of the one law makers wanted. If people read the book then the chance of Hitler's fantasy never repeating itself is greater then if people don't read it. For one thing it's a chilling read. It's also not very well written and doesn't show any intellectual brilliance of the author. And the third argument to read it is that it's a part of recent world history, weather we like it or not. As far as the translation goes, some people state it's sloppy and bad, well I disagree. In Poland, where I live there is a Polish translation available and this is sloppy and quite unreadable. I was looking for an English translation for quite some time, but none was to be found in Poland and all Amazon branches didn't ship the title abroad. This year however I managed to order from Amazon.com (Amazon.co.uk still doesn't allow international orders) despite it stating on the page that this item can only be shipped to the continental US. So for international customers, an important info, it is shipped to countries where buying and owning the book is legal (like for instance Poland) it probably is not shipped to countries where it is not (like for instance Germany).
B000YPUF9W|5.0|Alice (Milla Jovovich) wanders the Nevada desert alone, flying under the radar of the Umbrella Corporation.<br /><br />It's been five years since the deadly T-virus outbreak. The world is all but in shambles. Alice believes that only Alaska is the last safe place on Earth. An old journal she found with a six-month-old radio transcription told her so.<br /><br />On her journey, Alice comes across a small caravan of survivors headed up by Claire (Ali Larter) that also happens to be carrying along some old friends: Slater (Matthew Marsden) and L.J. (Mike Epps).<br /><br />She convinces them to head north to Alaska, and so they embark, fighting off the dead at every turn, even undead crows that have been transformed from feasting on zombie flesh.<br /><br />Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen) wants Alice back under his control as he focuses on perfecting her as a weapon against the undead. Except, once Alice catches on, she manages to disable their system of control over her and escapes with Claire and the others.<br /><br />All hope lost, and having been bitten by one of the dead himself, Dr. Isaacs uses the antivirus on himself .  . . but in a different way, creating a result neither he nor Alice expected.<br /><br />It's ultra crazy good and suspenseful action horror in this third installment in the Resident Evil series.<br /><br />Wow. I mean, man oh man, I love this movie. So, so good. I'm a sucker for roadside horror and sleepy towns. This movie has both. The zombies? Pure gruesome since most of them have been rotting for five years as they wander around devouring the rest of the living.<br /><br />The zombie crows were a nice touch. So, so many of them. Swarms. That's the thing I always tell people about zombies. One zombie's not so bad. Get a whole mess of them together and they're scary as all get out. Same for zombie crows. There was enough here to turn the sky black. Freaky.<br /><br />The development of Alice's powers was cool and though her telekinesis might seem kind of outlandish to some, it's portrayed well here and done with the utmost seriousness and not used as a cop-out to get her out of a jam.<br /><br />I felt bad for her as well when she saw all those clones of herself rotting out in the desert sun. That'd be heartbreaking, upsetting and angering for anyone. I'm glad she gave Dr. Isaacs his due.<br /><br />The ending raises a ton of questions for the forthcoming Resident Evil: Afterlife. I'm eager to see how they deal with that army of Alices without it coming off goofy or repetitive.<br /><br />This movie's score was also spectacular, the hard beat of the drums and dark, raunchy guitar giving it a very awesome grittiness that adds to the whole post-apocalyptic feel.<br /><br />Check this flick out. It's hardcore, loaded with gore and just down right fantastic.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P. Fuchs<br />Canister Xt used as a cop-out to get her out of a jam.

B000IMVMFM|4.0|I'm writing this review based upon seeing this Blu-ray release on a Blu-ray player that wasn't mine and I wasn't able to really put the release through the paces. What I did see impressed me, however. I'm awaiting the arrival of my order from Amazon UK. From what I've personally seen in person and what I've read in various locations online the transfer of this film to Blu-ray makes it better than the original DVD release even though things would have been better if it had been remastered the. The DTS audio is a huge plus. The one downside is that they didn't add any new extra content whatsoever. I'm fine with that, however.<br /><br />The Crow has always ranked on my list of favorite movies. All the subsequent sequels were garbage. The darkness of the movie, Brandon Lee, the music used, etc, all make it a great experience for the viewer. Rating this movie for content and the story is an easy 5 but it's one of those movies that people either love or hate. I've never met anyone who had an opinion in the middle.<br /><br />Finally, I am not ordering this from Amazon US since they don't carry it. I never had the chance to since it's supposedly been discontinued according to Amazon. I ordered my copy from Amazon UK for $16 including shipping. I'm buying the Region B Blu-ray which means it won't play on a North American Region A player. I don't have to worry about the region issue but most people in North America do. I don't want people reading my review and then buying the Amazon UK version only to find that this Region B release won't play in their Region A Blu-ray player. I've warned people so I take no responsibility for people who don't heed my warning.<br /><br />I'm rating this a 4 because it's not a perfect Blu-ray release. Getting the Blu-ray release required extra effort and the ability to play Region B discs, it lacks new bonus material while it is labeled a Collector's Edition release, and it wasn't remastered which would have made it better. For those negative points I subtracting 1 star. Because The Crow this is a great movie, and from what I have seen of the Blu-ray release it is worth having in a Blu-ray library, I'm giving it a 4.<br /><br />EDIT: I have now received my Region B release of the Blu-ray and watched it. I'm more than happy with it. There's no extra content but I now have it added to my Blu-ray collection and it's better than my original standard DVD release. I see that a few people are now selling the item through Amazon US since I posted my initial review. The prices are simply ridiculous. I strongly recommend people who can play a Region B Blu-ray disc to just buy the disc new from Amazon UK. I paid all of $16 including shipping from the UK to the US. The three people selling it through Amazon US are marking it up simply because they can. The guy asking $9999 is a clown.

B00005RG6M|5.0|Excellent album, the surround effects are excellent too, every song is good enough to let it play one after the other and then repeat the entire disc, i have nothing else to say than: if you are looking for hi-fidelity dvd-audio demonstration, this will do it very well.
0670021652|5.0|This book is less like EPL and more like Gilbert's Last American Man.  It wonderfully weaves the historical, the sociological and the personal into a compelling narrative in a way that few authors beyond Gilbert and Bill Bryson can accomplish so skillfully.  It will undoubtedly have detractors who feel it is either too much or too little like EPL, but I thought it was a great read and would recommend it highly.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|I have always liked this movie. Bought it for my 4 year old granddaughter and she loves it, watches it almost every day.
B001GCUO52|2.0|Well guys, look at it this way. The Final Destination Series has now made its fame in the horror movie world: the gory accidental deaths, the premonitions leading up to each, the shattering conclusions. We get it... Final Destination. And if anything, this better be \\"The Final Destination\\". How many installments have we endured already? Oh right, 4. I forgot since we have had so many fly our way.<br /><br />I very well enjoyed the first movie. It was original, it had a cool concept that we hadn't seen before, good acting, some good gory deaths, and also some good aspiring actors that are still in movies today. The second one I enjoyed, but not as much, but I still enjoyed it. And hell, I'm man enough to even fess up to enjoying the third one, even though it was slightly retarded, but I still liked it- it had that kid from the opening scene of The Ring 2, it solidified my fear of roller coasters (I don't think I'll be going on The Mind Bender anymore or going tanning after seeing it), Had lots of gore, and that (choose their fate) thing was fun to play with.<br /><br />And then I saw this one. I missed its 3D theatrical release which is something I regretted. But recently tonight I sat down and watched it in 2D on Blu-Ray, and I guess I don't regret missing it in 3D. This movie is pretty much a confirmation that the series is pure straight dead in the water (no pun intended).<br /><br />The movie begins with the four principal characters: One's a guy named Nick that looks like my friend Nick, two are sexy chicks: Lori and Janet, and another guy, named Hunt, who has hair that is but a hint to how big of a douche bag he is. They are all gathered at the speedway for a bit of the ol' Speed racing... in a VERY OLD speedway. After smuggling Jack Daniels into binoculars (*makes JD smuggling plans for the coming U2 concert*... OK!!! I'm joking!!!! God, take a joke, will ya?), tampons as ear plugs, and an obnoxious racist redneck behind him, a car crash is caused by a flat tire, and the guy's car basically collapses on the speedway, and... well... its parts shoot out towards everyone! And furthermore... *dramatic music*... the speedway collapses!...<br /><br />...oh, well, it was just a premonition. So like in the other movies, our heroine, Nick saves everyone... except one who escaped! Anyways, so after. Basically, there's a memorial at the speedway after it actually happens, and thus like in the other movies, a bunch if far-fetched deaths and other stuff happen, and Nick tries to \\"rip up Death's list\\", yada yada yada. And I don't need to summarize the rest because you hae seen the other three (or at least I hope you have), and so you basically know the turn of events.<br /><br />Now let's take a look at the movie in general. It's called \\"THE\\" Final Destination. The \\"the\\" is emphasized for a reason: it's THE Final Destination. Thankfully it is. At 80 minutes, this movie goes by fast. Thankfully it does- the movie is an 80 minute re-hashing of movies 1-3, but with more deaths and gore, more of everything basically. More nudity, more douche bags, more hot girls, more... need I continue?<br /><br />See the problem with this movie is that as virtually plot-free as it is, it's also criminally BORING. Maybe it's because of the nausem of the first three movies. But there's nothing new, nothing exciting here. This is basically just the entire series in autopilot mode- with nothing but more deaths and gore. You can basically say this movie is The PERIOD Final Destination, but then again you could say that for the others too. And Ellis tries to fill in the void with some CG, but even that fails, because it is virtually fake looking and cheap.<br /><br />Also, despite this movie being THE Final Destination, the ending leaves the gates open for a fifth movie. But why I would want to sit through a fifth installment after an arse-numbing 80 minutes of a fourth installment is beyond me. But then again, a completist, my inner hypocrite will see the fifth movie. Who am I to break up a series?<br /><br />So basically, by skipping this movie, you aren't missing anything. Just what you saw in movies 1-3 again, and what you will continue to see for years to come.<br /><br />IN TOTAL:<br />Entertainment: 4/10- wasted potential<br />Sex: 3/10, and NOT of the good kind (more like the douche bag kind)<br />Violence: It's a FD movie, okay?/10<br />Gore: I'm keeping my *eye* on you/10<br />Jerk hair: 10/10<br />Death by pool drains: Will have exhausted outdoor pools for months to come<br />Car Washes: Well, there's a new definition of \\"suddy water\\"<br />Seen it all before: 10/10<br />Superfluous dreams: Holy crap!

B0033TJATW|5.0|I am so happy that they are finally releasing this movie on dvd for a reasonable price.    I remember this movie from my childhood. My father bought it on VHS when it was first released (and still has it)!    It is a great movie for the family, and touches on the important topic of drugs.
1421532255|2.0|As mentioned elsewhere, this is an alternate version of movie 3.  Personally, I really liked the 3 live action movies, as well as the manga and the anime.  I enjoyed \\"Deathnote: Another Note,\\" the book by Nisioisin, and thought I'd give this book a try as well.  Unfortunately, I was tempted not to finish it, simply because the writing is nowhere near the level of either the manga or \\"Another Note.\\"  (I only finished it because the cat was sleeping in my lap, and I couldn't reach another book.)  Scenes are a choppy page and a half each, there is absolutely no character development, and the writing is not what I would consider as being on a professional level.  (Sorry, M, whoever you are.  And that said, there is certainly a lot of stuff published that I also don't consider to be on a professional level.  Perhaps I'm too picky.)  Read this pretty much only if you are a rabid L fan, and have to read everything associated with the Deathnote universe. Otherwise, I'd recommend giving it a miss.
B002T9H2MO|5.0|\\"Moon\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: It is the near future. Astronaut Sam Bell is living on the far side of the moon, completing a three-year contract with Lunar Industries to mine Earth's primary source of energy, Helium-3. It is a lonely job, made harder by a broken satellite that allows no live communications home. Taped messages are all Sam can send and receive. Thankfully, his time on the moon is nearly over, and Sam will be reunited with his wife, Tess, and their three-year-old daughter, Eve, in only a few short weeks. Finally, he will leave the isolation of \\"Sarang,\\" the moon base that has been his home for so long, and he will finally have someone to talk to beyond \\"Gerty,\\" the base's well-intentioned, but rather uncomplicated computer. Suddenly, Sam's health starts to deteriorate. Painful headaches, hallucinations and a lack of focus lead to an almost fatal accident on a routine drive on the moon in a lunar rover. While recuperating back at the base (with no memory of how he got there), Sam meets a younger, angrier version of himself, who claims to be there to fulfill the same three year contract Sam started all those years ago. Confined with what appears to be a clone of his earlier self, and with a \\"support crew\\" on its way to help put the base back into productive order, Sam is fighting the clock to discover what's going on and where he fits into company plans.    The cast led by Sam Rockwell (in a career-best performance as Sam Bell) is excellent! The directing by Duncan Jones (who also wrote the story) (who also directing the upcoming \\"Source Code\\" (2011) is brilliant! The story by Jones & the screenplay by Nathan Parker is brilliant!    The music by Clint Mansell (who also did the music to \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" (2000), \\"The Fountain\\" (2006) & \\"The Wrestler\\" (2008), which were directed by Darren Aronofsky) is brilliant! The cinematography by Gary Shaw is brilliant! The film editing by Nicolas Gaster (who also did the film editing to the upcoming \\"Welcome To The Rileys\\" (2010) is brilliant! The casting by Manuel Puro & Jeremy Zimmerman is brilliant! The production design by Tony Noble is brilliant! The art direction by Hideki Arichi (who is one of the set designers to the upcoming \\"Robin Hood\\" (2010) & Josh Fifarek (who also did the set decoration to \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" (2001) is brilliant! The costume design by Jane Petrie (who also did the costume design to \\"28 Weeks Later\\" (2007) is brilliant!    This is a brilliant and impressive sci-fi thriller that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat. This is a brilliant debut for Duncan Jones and a career-best performance for Sam Rockwell, thus far. The visual effects are impressive. This is one of the best films of last year.

B000025XKM|5.0|With all these new bands hustling together and releasing songs with auto tuning or otherwise busy and unnatural music, it is good to listen to this CD because the simplicity of all the songs is really fresh and draws you in. The only two things you hear on this CD is Nick Drake and his beautiful acoustic guitar, with the exception of a few bars in the song \\"Pink Moon\\" where a piano actually comes in. Certainly, Nick Drake is what I would call an acquired taste and not for the mainstream audience. However, that does not make his music bad at all and in my opinion makes it even better. I like the CD because it's short and you can listen to it all in one sitting easier than most CD's out there. Not to mention most of the songs are 2-3 minutes long.    My favorite songs on the CD are Pink Moon, Place To Be, Road, and From The Morning. This is a 5 star CD for me.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|This is an interesting and thoughtful character study of a lonely man on a lunar mining outpost.  He finds out after a while that.....spoilers ahead...............<br /><br />he is simply one in a long line of clones of the original Sam Bell, who apparently died some time ago.  The clones are of course not supposed to be aware that they are clones, nor are they to know that there are many more just like them.  This is the central conflict.<br /><br />More could have been done with the emotional complications that would ensue if any of us discovered multiple copies of ourselves. We would feel threatened and frightened.  Sam shows some of this, though not quite enough.<br />Still, this is a fascinating look at loneliness and corporate exploitation.
B00005KK4P|5.0|B&ouml;hm's Schubert cycle has outlasted many of its rivals on record--and deservedly so.  B&ouml;hm's approach to this repertoire is admirably direct, unpretentious, and vigorous (despite tempos that might strike some listeners as slower than ideal).<br /><br />In the early symphonies (1-4), B&ouml;hm does not aim as much to charm the listener as to convey a salutary toughness that reveals the youthful Schubert's debt to Beethoven.  Those who prize Beecham's inimitable brio and elegance, or Abbado's quicksilver lightness and intimacy, might find B&ouml;hm a bit too serious by comparison; on the other hand, listeners who have found early Schubert insubstantial will welcome B&ouml;hm's classicist priorities--including his decision to take minuets at a stately tempo rather than converting them into one-in-a-bar scherzi.<br /><br />B&ouml;hm brings added warmth and spontaneity to the two transitional works (5 & 6), without any slackening of discipline.  The B-flat symphony glows with a radiance similar to Bruno Walter's cherishable recording.  Beecham brings an infectious sparkle to this symphony, and to the C-major, that no other conductor has ever quire matched (at least in my experience), but B&ouml;hm is not far behind.  In fact, I find B&ouml;hm's choice of tempi in no. 6 far more congenial than Beecham's, particularly in the finale (which Beecham, for all his charms, tends to drag). Indeed, B&ouml;hm's is the only recorded version of the stylistically inconsistent \\"Little C-Major\\"  that I find fully convincing.<br /><br />The two mature masterpieces (8 & 9) flourish under B&ouml;hm's direction.  The \\"Unfinished\\" combines dramatic tension and tenderness in just the right proportions.  Neither the famous secondary theme in the first movement, nor the yearning theme which dominates the second is allowed to languish; B&ouml;hm lets the expression emerge effortlessly and naturally from an unbroken and unselfconsciously lyrical line.  Perhaps others have conveyed a greater sense of mystery or moment in the first movement's opening gambit, but once again B&ouml;hm convinces by keeping everything in proportion.  Classical virtues predominate in his outstanding realization of the \\"Great\\" C-major as well.  In all four movements B&ouml;hm conveys the sense of a great occasion, even majesty, without undermining the crucial sense of forward movement.  Few conductors on record have gotten this balance right.  Only Furtw&auml;ngler surpasses B&ouml;hm/BPO in this work (I haven't heard B&ouml;hm's later version of this symphony with the Dresden Stadtskapelle which some critics have found superior).<br /><br />Throughout the cycle, the BPO plays with outstanding virtuosity, character and involvement, as we would have expected.  The recording is beautifully balanced--clear, solid and natural (like the interpretations).  Given the bargain price advantage, this set could be a first choice for novice collectors.  It certainly should be in the collection of anyone who values the best of \\"old-world\\" interpretive traditions.  In this sense, B&ouml;hm's is and remains the classic Schubert cycle.  Avid Schubertians will also want to own the (also fine) Marriner/St. Martin's set on Phillips, if only to hear Brian Newbould's stunning \\"realizations\\" of Schubert's fragmentary sketches for several symphonic works (including the forward-looking \\"Symphony no. 10\\" which clearly anticipates both Bruckner and Mahler).ambit, but once again Böhm convinces by keeping everything in proportion.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|This review also applies to [[ASIN:B002BSHXJA The Beatles Mono Box Set]].  It took 22 years, but with the newly remastered stereo and mono box sets, The Beatles' music finally gets the treatment it deserves!  Kudos to the EMI Abbey Road team for doing a terrific job with the remastering.  I'll try not to duplicate what others have written, but here is my review of the remasters, based on a disc-by-disc comparison that I did against the original 1987 CDs a couple of months ago:  PLEASE PLEASE ME, WITH THE BEATLES, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, BEATLES FOR SALE:  These first four albums were originally issued as mono CDs back in 1987, though many of the stereo mixes later appeared on the Capitol Albums box sets and other compilations.  Actually, only four songs make their global CD stereo debut here:  &#34;Misery&#34; and &#34;There's a Place&#34; from PLEASE PLEASE ME, and &#34;I Should Have Known Better&#34; and &#34;You Can't Do That&#34; from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  George Martin did not want the twin-track mixes of the first two albums issued on CD, and insisted that the mono versions be used; for the second two albums, recorded on 4-track tape, Martin wanted to remix those two for CD, but was informed by EMI that it was too close to the release date deadline, so four mono CDs were released in 1987.  There is not a whole lot of difference between the 1987 and 2009 mono versions, though the new ones are cleaner and less muddy.  The stereo versions, however, blow both mono sets out of the water, as far as I am concerned.  NOTE:  The &#34;fake stereo&#34; versions of &#34;Love Me Do&#34; and &#34;P.S. I Love You,&#34; which were issued on the original stereo vinyl album, were replaced with the standard mono versions on the new PLEASE PLEASE ME CD.  For those who must have the fake stereos, they are available on THE EARLY BEATLES CD, included in THE CAPITOL ALBUMS, VOL. 2 box set. NOTE: The 2014 reissue of THE EARLY BEATLES (available separately, and included in the new THE U.S.ALBUMS box set) has the true mono mixes of the songs, just like the 2009 versions of PLEASE PLEASE ME.  HELP!, RUBBER SOUL:  Because he was not satisfied with the original 1965 stereo mixes, George Martin did remixes of these two albums for their 1987 CD release.  The remastered stereo CDs use these remixes, and while they sound considerably better in 2009, my preference is for the original 1965 stereo mixes, which appear alongside the mono mixes in the mono box set.  The monos are good as well - in fact, they sound better than the 1987 stereo CDs, though not as good as the 2009 stereo versions.  American listeners may find the mono mixes to the soundtrack (first) half of HELP! a little strange-sounding.  This is because the mono version of the Capitol album (available on THE CAPITOL ALBUMS, VOL. 2) is a &#34;fold-down&#34; of the stereo mix - that is, the two channels of the stereo master tape are combined onto one track during the disc-cutting stage. UPDATE: The 2014 reissue of the Capitol HELP! ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK CD has both the original U.K. mono mixes and the 1987 stereo remixes.  REVOLVER:  My favorite Beatle album (next to ABBEY ROAD). Both the mono and stereo versions of the new CDs are far superior to the 1987 stereo version.  Save for &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34; and &#34;Eleanor Rigby,&#34; which have appeared in mono on CD singles, the mono mix of REVOLVER makes its global CD debut in 2009.  It's a shame that American fans were denied the full 14-song version of this album until vinyl imports became available in the late 1970s; three of John Lennon's best numbers (&#34;I'm Only Sleeping,&#34; &#34;Doctor Robert,&#34; and &#34;And Your Bird Can Sing&#34;) were issued on the &#34;YESTERDAY&#34;...AND TODAY album in America, leaving the U.S. version of REVOLVER with just 11 songs. Both of the latter two titles were released on CD in 2014, as part of THE U.S. ALBUMS box set, and as individual CDs.  SGT. PEPPER:  A magnificent album, in both stereo and mono, and again far superior to the 1987 CD.  Although I generally prefer the stereo release, the mono version has its virtues as well, particularly on &#34;She's Leaving Home,&#34; which is at its original speed on the stereo version, but sped up in mono to make Paul sound younger (per Bruce Spizer).  Also, the laughter at the end of &#34;Within You Without You&#34; and Paul's scat vocal at the end of the &#34;Sgt. Pepper&#34; reprise are much louder in mono.  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR: Because the original six-song double EP (released in CD format in 1992 as part of the COMPACT DISC EP COLLECTION) was not viable in the U.S. market in 1967, Capitol Records added the group's five 1967 single releases to create an 11-song LP, which was ultimately released in the UK in 1976.  The newly remastered stereo CD, like its 1987 predecessor, is based on the 1971 German LP issue, which contained all 11 songs in full glorious stereo.  The original Capitol album had the last 3 tracks in simulated Duophonic stereo, as well as different (earlier) mixes of &#34;I Am the Walrus&#34; and &#34;Strawberry Fields Forever.&#34;  Strangely, when Parlophone issued the album in the UK in the 1970s, the cassette version (Parlophone TC-PCS 3077) used the all-stereo German master, but the vinyl (Parlophone PCTC 255) reverted back to the original Capitol version with the Duophonic mixes.  The remastered stereo CD is the clear winner here.  Although all of the mono mixes have been issued on the EP and SINGLES COLLECTION CD box sets, this is the first time that the actual mono album has been issued since Capitol deleted it in early 1968 (and, according to Beatles historian Bruce Spizer, the surplus mono albums were sent to Brazil, of all places).  THE BEATLES (THE WHITE ALBUM): Of all of the remastered albums, the White Album is the most significantly improved.  The original 1987 CD was flat and lifeless and had three indexing errors:  when the songs &#34;Wild Honey Pie,&#34; &#34;Rocky Raccoon,&#34; and &#34;Cry Baby Cry&#34; were programmed to play by themselves, the intros of the next three songs (respectively, &#34;Bungalow Bill,&#34; &#34;Don't Pass Me By,&#34; and &#34;Revolution 9&#34;) are heard as well.  These errors have been corrected on the new remastered CD, and the entire album sounds fantastic.  The mono version is also quite interesting because it was not originally issued in America, although the mono versions of two songs (&#34;Helter Skelter&#34; and &#34;Don't Pass Me By&#34;) were issued on the Capitol RARITIES album in 1980.  While the mono version is fascinating, the stereo is much better.  YELLOW SUBMARINE:  This is the original soundtrack album, with six Beatle songs on the first half and the seven-song George Martin film score on the second half.  On the original LP, &#34;Only A Northern Song&#34; was mixed only in mono because of technical limitations at the time; a fake stereo version appears on that LP and the original 1987 CD, but the previously unissued mono mix appears on the new CD.  The mono UK release of the YELLOW SUBMARINE album was a &#34;fold-down&#34; version of the stereo.  Although Martin's score sounds magnificent, as does the rest of the remastered CD, listeners who purchase the CDs individually are advised to purchase 1999's YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, which contains 15 remixed versions of the Beatle songs in the film, including the first-ever true stereo mix of the &#34;Only a Northern Song&#34; master.  An alternate stereo take of that song appears on the ANTHOLOGY 2 album from 1996.  ABBEY ROAD: The Beatles' recording swan song (though the next-to-last release, and, if you count the HEY JUDE LP, the third-from-the-last release in America).  My favorite album (George Martin's too), and a magnificent presentation that is leaps and bounds over its 1987 CD predecessor.  One minor beef: at the end of Side One of the vinyl LP, the song &#34;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&#34; has a closing instrumental riff that abruptly cuts off, creating a dramatic effect.  On the original CD, &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34; begins just a few seconds later and this effect is lost.  On the remastered CD, there is only a one-second break between the tracks.  It's too bad that the engineers didn't add a one-minute band of silence between the two songs, which would have restored the original effect.  LET IT BE:  This is the much-criticized Phil Spector &#34;reproduction&#34; from 1970, and the sound quality of the remaster compares favorably to the 2003 release, LET IT BE...NAKED.  Though NAKED is the better version, the lack of quality is not all &#34;Crazy Phil's&#34; fault; the songs themselves were not up to normal Beatles standards, probably because the group was not getting on well at the time.  Actually, I prefer Phil's mix of the title song.  The group wisely reunited later in the year to record ABBEY ROAD; they obviously wanted to finish out on a positive note, and certainly did.  PAST MASTERS/MONO MASTERS:  Originally issued as two separate CDs (VOLUME ONE and VOLUME TWO) in 1988, the two PAST MASTERS discs have been combined into one set for this remastered CD release.  All 33 of the group's original non-LP tracks are collected here, and four songs that were issued in mono on the 1988 version are in wonderful stereo here - &#34;From Me to You,&#34; &#34;Thank You Girl,&#34; &#34;Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand,&#34; and &#34;Sie Liebt Dich.&#34;  The sound quality on all of the other tracks is a significant improvement over the earlier version, as well.  Interestingly, &#34;Thank You Girl&#34; appears in its original stereo mix for the first time (at its natural speed and without the echo effects that appeared on THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM version).  Disc one of MONO MASTERS (included in the mono box set) has the same tracks as PAST MASTERS, but all in mono; disc two is similar, but replaces &#34;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&#34; &#34;Old Brown Shoe,&#34; and the single version of &#34;Let It Be,&#34; which were only mixed in stereo, with the mono mixes of four songs from the YELLOW SUBMARINE album - &#34;Only A Northern Song&#34; (also found on the remastered YS CD), &#34;All Together Now,&#34; &#34;Hey Bulldog,&#34; and &#34;It's All Too Much&#34; (unique to this compilation).  These mono mixes were intended for a YELLOW SUBMARINE EP that was prepared in March 1969, but never released.  The mono mix of &#34;Across the Universe&#34; originally donated to the World Wildlife Fund, was also intended for that EP; it follows the mono UK single versions of &#34;Get Back&#34; and &#34;Don't Let Me Down&#34; on this CD.  A stereo mix of &#34;Universe&#34; with bird sound effects was prepared for NO ONE'S GONNA CHANGE OUR WORLD, the World Wildlife Fund charity album, in late 1969.  Interestingly, these same bird sound effects (at the beginning and end of this song) are also on the mono version.  NOTE: Because no stereo mixes exist for &#34;Love Me Do (Original Single Version),&#34; &#34;She Loves You,&#34; &#34;I'll Get You,&#34; and &#34;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number),&#34;  those four songs appear in mono on both PAST MASTERS and MONO MASTERS. (Although a reedited and extended stereo mix of &#34;YKMN (LUTN)&#34; was prepared for ANTHOLOGY 2 in 1996, the original has only been issued in mono).  The stereo CDs are packaged in digipaks with expanded booklets with original liner notes and new historical and recording notes.  A modified version of the 1987 SGT. PEPPER booklet is included, as well as the complete MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR booklet.  The YELLOW SUBMARINE booklet has the U.S. Dan Davis liner notes, as well as the U.K. Tony Palmer/Derek Taylor notes.  The mono box set, manufactured in Japan, has the CDs packaged in mini-LP sleeves with resealable outer sleeves, complete with the original inner sleeve LP dust jackets, static-free rice paper sleeves for each CD, and such amenities as the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR booklet with the Capitol logo, and the SGT. PEPPER cutouts.  Each CD has its proper period label:  the gold-and-black Parlophone label for PLEASE PLEASE ME, yellow-and-black Parlophone labels from WITH THE BEATLES to SGT. PEPPER; the original Capitol rainbow label for MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR; and green Apple labels for the last four albums.  PAST MASTERS and MONO MASTERS have the yellow-and-black Parlophone label on disc 1, and the Apple label on disc 2.  The Mini-Documentaries DVD (included with the stereo box set) has a red Apple label.  The mini-docs (also included as QuickTime files on the individual stereo CDs) don't have a lot of new material, but are a nice touch nonetheless.  If you can only afford one set, get the stereo box, but if you can afford it, get the mono box set too, as well as the Capitol Albums sets, YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, LET IT BE...NAKED, and LOVE.  As they say in &#34;Mr. Kite,&#34; a splendid time is guaranteed for all.
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|So glad I purchased the SB-900.  I've read reviews stating the pros and cons but personally have no problem with the overheating and subsequent shut-off that has been reported.  I purchased the 8 cell PowerexMH-C801D Charger and their 2700 Powerex rechargable batteries.  On the conditioning mode the charger rejuvenates and cycles the batteries through a charge , discharge, and slow recharge that can take up to 14 hours..but the batteries run cooler when they are all equally charged and I have had very good luck   The flash itself is wonderful..much smarter than the photographer and my candids look as professional as my studio work

0783225482|5.0|Plot summaries abound in the reviews currently listed, so 'nuff said about that....this is just to confirm, for those who haven't seen this modern-day should-be-classic, that it is well worth your time.  The imaginative plot is enhanced by the terrific special effects, and the cast plays it to the hilt.  Ms. Streep, fittingly, has been applauded by just about everyone on the planet and her work here justifies that. Sure, she can break your heart in \\"Sophie's Choice\\" and countless other films, but the woman is funny, too. Really funny. And well-matched with Goldie Hawn, whose own comedy chops are justly famous---they create a seamless, hysterical     love-hate relationship. They're both beautiful (at least, part of the time) and it's easy to see why they want to hold onto their looks. Bruce Willis fans will hardly recognize him in his his role as the spineless Ernest. I'm not really what you'd call a fan, but darned if his comic timing doesn't keep him right up there with his costars. The three of them seem to be having a wonderful time in this romp, and the mood is infectious. Excellent job, Mr. Zemeckis. Give this a look, and you'll probably want to buy the DVD.
B001RIY49C|4.0|The pros on this is that for serious collectors, it's a must have. Although it is plastic, it looks real cool.   The cons; Easy to scratch! Sound effects are crappy and I didn't like the fact that the eyes only turn on and off with the sounds. But I re-wired it so the lights stay on with a seperate switch hidden within. I was dissapointed tht there was no \\"Collector's Book\\". Seems like it would be appropriate for an edition such as this.  The dvds themselves have all been released already so nothing new there. But If you are a serious \\"movie memmorabilia\\" collector like myself, then get this edition. This Endoskull is by far one of the coolest in my dvd sets.  4 out of 5 stars only becuse there was no book or film cell or certificate, etc.
B00026WUAU|4.0|Bob Dylan has produced a body of work that firmly places him among the great performing artists of the twentieth/ twenty-first centuries. Dylan's work has transcended the genre of rock music to include strains of rockabilly, swing, country, folk, and blues music. However, on his often overlooked 1978 release, Street Legal, Dylan and his band deliver a collection of songs within the rock vein. Not the \\"ragged\\" electrified music of Live 1966 or Hard Rain (released 1976) or the polished sound of Live at Budokan (released 1979), but somewhere in between.   While the electric guitar is featured as a rhythm and lead instrument throughout, it is the tenor and soprano saxophone work of Steve Douglas that provides Street Legal with its unique sound (reminiscent of the way Scarlet Rivera's violin become synonymous with Desire). Douglas provides the verse ending riff on the lead track- \\"Changing of the Guards.\\" Driven forward by the warm tones of a Hammond organ, the aforementioned saxophone, and soulful background vocals, \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is rife with powerful images. The \\"palace of mirrors\\", Jupiter and Apollo, \\"renegade priests and treacherous young witches\\", and a \\"beloved maid\\" all make appearances in this surrealistic tale. The bluesy \\"New Pony\\" finds Dylan occupying his time with a new addition to his stable (double entendres abound). \\"No Time to Think\\" and \\"Baby Stop Crying\\" complete side one of the original record.  \\"Is Your Love in Vain?\\" opens side two with Dylan offering his thoughts on fame and the qualities he finds most appealing in a female partner. The foreboding \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\", one of the few songs from this album performed live in recent years, takes the listener on a strange journey into hostile territory with an unknown conclusion to the events described in the song. \\"True Love Tends to Forget\\" and \\"We Better Talk This Over\\" hint at the need for reconciliation and dialogue between Dylan and the party that has been offended. The final track, \\"Where Are You Tonight (Journey Through Dark Heat)\\", is another great story song; loaded with disparate images. Dylan concludes this track with wonderment at his ability to survive.   Street Legal received mediocre reviews upon its initial release; however, I must agree with a later Dylan lyric and ask, \\"Have you ever done the opposite of what the experts say?\\" On Street Legal we see Dylan \\"shedding off one more layer of skin\\"; an artist always in a state of becoming.
B000SEHG5U|4.0|I found Dawkins book very informative. He laid down the argument in each ordered chapter and backed up his argument with many facts. He even uses the Bible as a reference by quoting some of the more irrational verses that people cling to who might now even know the verses where in the Bible to begin with.    One thing I would have to say that the book is lacking in is that Dawkins focuses mainly on the Judaic-Christ-Islamic Religions and doesn't discuss Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism and their negatives. However I do understand that the religions not mentioned don't make up the most of the majority of world religion, and have less horrific treatments of those who don't believe in their ideologies.     Overall the book was very informative and did not mislead from the truth. At times it seemed that Dawkins was trying to just inform the public. He also tries to show another perspective to the people that blindly follow the teachings of their own religion, trying to get people to see their religion in a different way, a way of applying reason and understanding, asking questions rather then just follow blindfolded.         Shake off all the fears of servile prejudices, under which weak minds are servilely crouched. Fix reason firmly in her seat, and call on her tribunal for every fact, every opinion. Question with boldness even the existence of a God; because, if there be one, he must more approve of the homage of reason than that of blindfolded fear.

0061537969|5.0|Both my husband and I loved this book.  We listened to it on CD, so Enzo, the dog, really did talk to us.  It is laugh-out-loud funny at times and extremely sad at other times (we almost had to pull off of the road at one point while listening in the car since we were both crying.)  I highly recommend it.
1401323820|4.0|This is a knock off of the TV series, Castle. The book \\"Heat Wave \\" is the product of the research of the character, Richard Castle, a prize winning writer into the NYPD, mainly through his association with homicide detective, Kate Beckett. Nikki Heat, the heroine of this book, is Castle's heated up image of Kate, who is already sizzling. If you enjoy the TV series, you will certainly enjoy this fast moving novel, which follows a murder investigation and a multimillion dollar art robbery. The book answers the question of what would happen if the two characters on the show were allowed to get closer together. There would obviously be a \\"Heat Wave\\".
B0027BOL4G|5.0|this movie was one of the most shocking things I have ever seen. I knew that animals were treated badly, but didnt think it went to this extent.

I would also recommend the film \\"Blue Gold: world water wars\\" it uncovers the problems of our mass use of water.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I've always thought that the L2 and R2 triggers on the PS3 controller were always a little small and curved the opposite way that I'd like them to be.  These dual trigger controller additions add just the right amount of surface area and curvature that I would've wanted by default.  One thing I was worried about was the possibility of the triggers not being able to fit well enough on the buttons that they would just slip off during play.  I'm relived to say that this is not the case at all.  When you fit them correctly, there is a satisfying snap that you get when attaching.  Sure, if you put a lot of pressure on them on purpose, you can snap them off (like a previous reviewer mentioned), but I'm not one of those angry gamers that squeeze their controller really hard or throw it across the room when I lose.    All in all, these are an inexpensive way to add that extra control that you need on the PS3 controller.

0307266303|5.0|Author Christopher McDougall starts off this carnival of endurance by asking a simple question: Why does my foot hurt?  From there the story jumps off the line and delves into cutting-edge science and medicine, tribal customs, insane ultramarathons (100-mile footraces), philosophy, psychology and stories which seem to blur the lines between reality and fantasy and convincingly show that everything you know about running is wrong.<br /><br />For instance, the startling revelation that high-priced, ultra-cushioned running shoes have actually increased the number of running injuries or that our ancestors once hunted by simply running animals to exhaustion.  McDougall blends investigative journalism with a mix of rich storytelling, slowly revealing to the reader a fascinating thesis, that humans may indeed be born to run.<br /><br />Much of the book revolves around a secretive and primative tribe of Indians tucked away in the walls of Mexico's treacherous Copper Canyon.  These evasive natives are known for their ability to run for days without stopping, up and down the steep canyon walls with nothing more than sandals made from tire treads and a little pinole and homemade alcohol.  They are also known for their deep suspicion of outsiders, making McDougall's journey to understand their methods and eventually organize a race with them, even more incredible.<br /><br />Aside from the Tarahumara, we are introduced to some of the greatest ultra-endurance runners the world has ever known...and a bizarre cast of characters at that.  We hear their stories and share in their agony and extreme bliss.  People like Seattle's Scott Jurek, who ran the 153-mile Badwater Ultra (Death Valley to Mt Whitney in 130deg heat) in 24hrs 36min, or barefoot Ted, the chatty millionaire who discovered the secret to pain-free running when he threw away his shoes, and a wild young hippie girl named Jenn who drinks beer before races then demolishes the field, including all the men.<br /><br />This book is an interesting blend of science and art.  It questions some basic assumptions and uncovers a host of improbable discoveries about exercise and human nature.  You are left with a desire to more deeply share in an understanding known only to a select group of people, mainly that the human body is more capable than we ever dared to believe.f science and art.

031606792X|3.0|So I am not going to be so harsh on Breaking Dawn. I liked it... for the most part.I liked the fact that Bella got married to the boy of her dreams, i liked the fact that Jacob got to be apart of her family in the end, even though it was slightly strange how it all worked out. I even liked the neatly wrapped ending of no one dieing and Bella riding off into the sunset with her huby and daughter in hand. I liked all of that, but what I will agree with (as far as complaints go) are: on the sex thing... Three books have been leading up to this honeymoon night between Bella and Edward and it sooooo falls flat, it just doesn't happen. I am not asking for a playboy moment here, just more then gazing lovingly into each others eyes. the first book (twilight)had more steam then that. the second thing that i will agree with is the non-action at the end of the book. waiting for a battle that doesn't happen is just sad. meyer leads you to the field of battle, sword in hand and then, like a cruel joke, says 'just kidding' just wanted to see how you would react to having your life and your whole family's life threatened. come on, really? For me that was like the most important seen to just not have happened. So in the end if your willing to use your own imagination on two of the really important parts in the book.. Meyer gift wraps the final book for you nicely.
B002NHIK1E|3.0|i've been a HUGE fan of this series since i was 14. i was incredibly worried about the changes that were made to the original series... many of the characters, the plot points, and even the name of the town are very, very different there, and i'll always prefer the original three books. that said, the writing is pretty good, there are some interesting plot twists, and there are a few moments that make me squee. not simply because i'm a fan of the original series, but because they are interesting, humorous, and well written.<br /><br />there are some obvious, glaring flaws, such as elena being far too passive in this version and the love story between her and stefan being a little bit rushed... everything between the two of them happens just a little too fast, including the breaking up and then back together thing that seems to keep happening. without the love triangle in the books, damon's reason for being in fell's church and his character altogether suffer. he's a little bit too cruel at some times during this version, or that may be because caroline is so freaking adorable. in the books she was a typical bitchy, manipulative high school queen, and elena was nearly as bad, but here she's just ditzy and insecure and i want to hug her. maybe we'll see a bit of his softer side later in the series... his idea of bringing catherine back seems contrived and unworkable, but again, this may be fixed if we find out more about the way magic works in this world.<br /><br />the show also has a habit of giving us interesting new vampires and then immediately killing them off before they get much screen time. once is fine, twice is a bit odd, especially when they were so close together. the third time, i winced. either decide to introduce new characters or use what you already have, please. it's too much, and it's becoming too obvious and losing it's emotional impact, like when captain kirk had a girlfriend and you immediately knew she would die.<br /><br />i don't know how to bring up the oddest flaw without sounding insensitive to the matters of race, but... bonnie is supposed to be descended from people living in salem village at the time of the witch trials who were not persecuted, but decided to flee in case something happened to them. the only family recorded to have lived in salem village at that time who may have been the shade of brown her entire family seems to be were charged with witchcraft. it may be that she was mixed, but it still bothers me slightly, especially because the original story had her being a white descendant of celtic druids, which would have slid easily into that time period. bonnie's ancestor is a servant. she looks black and is living in the time of slavery, but apparently is not a slave. although the civil war is mentioned several times, no mention of slavery at all is ever in the show... it just seems... odd to gloss over something like that. i know it's not integral to the plot and there wouldn't be a huge plotline about it or anything, but it somehow comes off as a weird glossing over of racial issues.<br /><br />i like this series, and with a little work on the part of the writers and actors, it has the potential to become awesome. i look forward to the second season to see if it fulfills that potential.flaw without sounding insensitive to the matters of race, but... bonnie is supposed to be descended from people living in salem village at the time of the witch trials who were not persecuted, but decided to flee in case something happened to them. the only family recorded to have lived in salem village at that time who may have been the shade of brown her entire family seems to be were charged with witchcraft. it may be that she was mixed, but it still bothers me slightly, especially because the original story had her being a white descendant of celtic druids, which would have slid easily into that time period. bonnie's ancestor is a servant. she looks black and is living in the time of slavery, but apparently is not a slave. although the civil war is mentioned several times, no mention of slavery at all is ever in the show... it just seems... odd to gloss over something like that. i know it's not integral to the plot and there wouldn't be a huge plotline about it or anything, but it somehow comes off as a weird glossing over of racial issues.     i like this series, and with a little work on the part of the writers and actors, it has the potential to become awesome. i look forward to the second season to see if it fulfills that potential.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am loving this CD more and more. Listening to it on my way to and from work. I love the soothing sounds with great arrangements. Received it from my daughter for Christmas.Sometimes her voice sounds like Bonnie Rait, sometimes Cindy Lauper. Most of the time polished  occasionally a little hoarse, just a little. Wonderful all around. Keep up the good work. I look forward to her next CD. Please don't let this be her last. She is definitely filling a gap for many of us. I really loved the song written for her  I Am Who I Was Meant To Be. Much love and hope.
B002U4UZUE|5.0|I'll admit, I've been a Dire Straits 'fan' since I first heard this as a vinyl record back in the late 1970s. The combination of a tight four-piece ensemble playing music that they loved and were extremely good at, and the very high recording quality proved to be a winning combination. Obviously I wasn't alone as this record made an impression on many other music lovers and 'audiophiles' and has been used as an audiophile 'demo' recording for over thirty years. Now, we can rejoice in a true audio delight, that comes along all too rarely.    I've had the original Warner Brothers LP, as released here 'stateside', and a collection of British 'Vertigo' label pressings (that until now have been my first choice for the best sound) and a 'Super Bit Mapping'(SBM) high-resolution 'audiophile-quality' CD. And even a couple of Japanese LPs(the world's \\"quietest\\" vinyl). THIS version is easily the finest recording of this Dire Straits classic that I've EVER heard!!!!!    I sat in ecstasy yesterday afternoon totally amazed hearing subtleties and nuances in every song that I'd never heard before. The cymbals had a \\"shimmering\\" quality in the very air they were resonating in. Mark Knopfler's breathing and fine vocal intonations and inflections in his verses had a human 'presence' like he was right in the room with me. The sound of the felt-covered kick-drum foot pedal could be clearly discerned striking the stretched skin of the 'kick'(bass) drum, no longer being 'masked' sonically by the bass guitar's notes. It was like hearing it all fresh and new again and my skin had \\"goosebumps\\" with the total thrill of the experience. And this, mind you, is from the original ANALOG audio tapes, mixed as ANALOG, and made into a wonderful, flat, quiet 180 gram ANALOG vinyl record by a few people that care enough to exercise the care and techniques necessary to show off the capabilities of this older, \\"mature\\" technology.    IF you love Dire Straits and if you have a decent turntable, tonearm,and cartridge combination capable of resolving the 'magic' in the grooves of this record, RUN to the closest source of records in your neighborhood and BUY it NOW! You WILL NOT regret it. THIS new recording from Warner Brothers is truly 'World-Class' and the new 'reference standard' that every other version of this 'classic' recording will be compared to from now on. FIVE BIG BLAZING STARS for this one !!!!!    Added Note:  The  cover 'artwork' that amazon.com has accompanying this review is for the Warner Brothers Re-Master of the COMPACT DISC version. The album jacket that this Warner Brothers Re-Mastered 180gram LP record comes with is the 'original' LP record cover artwork with only the painting illustration and the name DIRE STRAITS across the top left of the record jacket cover.

Felipe has been frequently visiting Gilbert in the U.S., using up the maximum three months allotted to his U.S. visa, flying back to his home, and then flying back to the U.S. to visit the author for another three months. Because of his frequent visits, the U.S. Homeland Security becomes suspicious and detains Felipe on one of his flights back.     After lengthy interrogation, the U.S. Homeland Security officer warns Gilbert that if she wants Felipe to stay with her in the U.S., they must marry. To complicate matters, Felipe is deported and Gilbert hires an immigration lawyer to work out their case in the U.S., while she flies to Vietnam to join Felipe in their seclusion.     Most of the book focuses on Gilbert's view about marriage, compartmentalized into sections like \\"Marriage and Infatuation\\" or \\"Marriage and Subservience.\\" Interspersed throughout Gilbert's analysis of marriage (its history, gender inequality, state repression, personal memories, etc.), is an account of her and Felipe's travels, while waiting for things to get sorted back in the U.S. In Vietnam, Gilbert interviews some Hmong women from a local village about their marriages. Afterwards, she and Felipe travel to Laos, where Gilbert observes Laotian monks and hires a tour guide. Further travels include Cambodia, Thailand, and Bali where Gilbert and Felipe settle down into Felipe's old home.     Overall, I found this book to be a combination of a travel memoir and a book about marriage. As a reader and a fan of Ms. Gilbert's, I enjoyed the accounts of her journey with Felipe more than the academic parts about marriage. Nevertheless, I did find the predictable ending satisfying, as it ties up Gilbert's and Felipe's relationship, as well as the book's theme of marriage. For those careful enough to read the Acknowledgements at the end of the book, when addressing Felipe, Gilbert briefly summarizes the state of her relationship with him after the events of this book.
0882709194|5.0|i don't see why this book has gotten such bad reviews. its only a dollar and you get the revolutionary origin of species and 50 free pages of toilet paper, sure the toilet paper has some non-sensical scribbles on it by ray comfort but it will wipe you ass just as good.
0812973992|4.0|The rapturous praise that has been heaped on \\"Let the Great World Spin\\" puzzles me.  It is a good book, a very good book, but the best of 2009?  I disagree.  The totality of a great novel should exceed the sum of its parts.  For me this book fell short of that standard. Somehow it was structurally hollow at its core.  A series of vignettes, each exquistely depicted and remarkable in its own right, but collectively failing to deliver a seismic impact. McCann, like Philip Petit, the tightrope walker who inspired the novel, struts his stuff high in the air.  His writing is beautiful: it demonstrates abundant skill and sensitivity.  It enthralls.  But strangely the totality fails to deliver an overarching emotional or intellectual impact.  In the final chapter McCann attempts to tie together all that has come before and provide it with current relevance but, jarring and ineffective, it doesn't work.  A very good book. But the best of 2009?  If it had been set in Cleveland and didn't implicate the World Trade Center would it have merited that plaudit?  I have my doubts.
B002SJIO5E|4.0|District 9 arrived with little hype or advanced marketing but turned out to be the best action or sci-fi movie of Summer 2009. The story actually starts 20 years after the aliens have arrived in their dinged up ship. The alien ship hovers over Johannsburg, RSA while the aliens who piloted the ship are sick and malnourished. Fast forward 2 decades- their human hosts have lost interest in their plight, especially as humans are unable to exploit the aliens advanced weapons technology. This weaponry is actually linked to the alien DNA which of course we don't have. In a sign of hate and derision, the humans refer to the aliens as \\"Prawns.\\" The aliens have become just another bothersome minority to the people of Jo burg. 'District 9' refers to the special urban (slum)zone they live in. It is in this context that the main character, Wikus van de werwe, a quiet unassuming bureaucrat, stumbles upon secrets of the alien technology, including the advanced weapons. The movie is filmed documentary style with great effect.     When I first heard of this movie I doubted that it was going to be good. The plot at first seemed vaguely reminiscent of the 80s goofball sci-fi movie 'Alien Nation.' I never could believe the premise- that Aliens advanced enough to build and pilot an interstellar ship thousands of light years to earth could then be pushed around so easily by human authorities. But this movie is nothing like that flawed and gimmicky movie- District 9 is creative, has a fresh script and great special effects. And the interaction between van Werwe and his Alien friend and young son seem genuine. It was enjoyable from start to finish, a worthy addition to any sci-fi fans movie collection.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|The mother Lisa has the most poignant line in \\"Ponyo,\\" saying the equivalent of \\"When you find yourself surrounded by magic and wonder, you don't try and understand it you just enjoy it.\\"<br /><br />To me, that is the theme and lesson of \\"Ponyo\\" (\\"Gake no Ue no Ponyou\\" or \\"Ponyo on the Cliffs\\"). After dabbling in darker themes and more adult-orientated fare like [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]] and [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]], Miyazaki has returned to the lighter, simpler themes of the magic and mystery of childhood as found in his groundbreaking [[ASIN:B002ZTQV8Y My Neighbor Totoro]]. One can always tell the target audience for a Miyazaki film by the age of the main character: \\"Spirited Away\\" was made for 10-year olds, \\"Princess Mononoke\\" was made for teenagers. The lead characters in \\"Ponyo\\" are 5 years old.<br /><br />Like \\"My Neighbor Totoro,\\" \\"Ponyo\\" is a film based on a childlike sense of joy and imagination. There is no need for a \\"villain\\" or some arbitrary conflict or threat for the children to overcome. Like Satsuki and Mei, Sosuke and Ponyo are pure at heart, and open to exploring the wonders around them. They feel their emotions without cynicism or thought, instead living in the moment and experiencing its joys, sorrows and fears.<br /><br />Which is not to say there is no depth here. In \\"Ponyo,\\" Miyazaki has blended two unlikely sources; Richard Wagner's pounding opera [[ASIN:B00092ZAOA Die Walkure]] from [[ASIN:B000QFBW6K Der Ring Des Nibelungen]] and Hans Christian Anderson's melancholy fairy tale [[ASIN:0786803835 The Little Mermaid]]. The essential set-up comes from \\"Die Walkure,\\" where the god Wotan holds the goddess Freia captive, and is also the possessor of the Rhinegold Ring which grants vast magical powers so long as one gives up all possibility of love. As a nod to this, the name Ponyo is giving by her father is Br&uuml;nnhilde, one of the Valkyrie who feels the power of the Ring and must make the choice between love and paradise. This story is skillfully blended with Anderson's \\"Little Mermaid,\\" about a sea creature who must win the love of a human or be reduced to soulless sea foam.<br /><br />Miyazaki essentially presents two movies. The front film is basic, colorful and easy to understand for children. The animation in \\"Ponyo\\" is some of the best that I have ever seen, with Miyazaki personally drawing much of the underwater and ocean scenes, utilizing the influence of classic Japanese ukiyo-e pictures. Miyazaki has said that \\"Ponyo\\" is his most technically complicated film, using more unique images than any previous film.<br /><br />The second, deeper story is something that can only be assembled from fragments and snatches of conversation. For example, the wizard Fujimoto, Ponyo's father, was a human being who fell in love with the ocean goddess Gran Mammare, and struggled for centuries to burn away his humanity and become consort and protector for the entity he loved. More than anyone, he understands the sacrifices and struggles awaiting Ponyo when she loves someone not of her world. These story/sub-story elements are one of the things I love so much about Japanese film, where more expectations are put on the audience to read between the lines and to give thought to the unspoken as well as the spoken<br /><br />I am not sure how much of this deeper story survived the translation into English, as I watched the film in Japanese. There are some nuances that probably went missing, and I am curious as to how some of the scenes were handled, such as when Lisa sings Sosuke a part of the theme song to \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\" to cheer him up when his father is not home. Some other things, such as the significance of tunnels in Japanese folklore (considered the realm of female Mountain Gods who are prone to jealousy, it is assumed that the tunnel would not take kindly to a water deity passing through. However, outside the tunnel is a statue of Jizo, the protector of children, which sends a visual clue to the audience that Sosuke and Ponyo are going to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.<br /><br />Miyazaki proved in \\"Ponyo\\" that he is still the greatest director of animated films alive. I am so thrilled to have seen this movie, and I know I will watch it again and again.oing to be alright.) also might pass unnoticed or appear confusing to Western audiences, although every Japanese person would inately understand this without needing to be told.

0307394549|5.0|Love this book. The cookies are yummy and I find most of the recipes easy.
0307454541|5.0|I didn't know what to expect from this novel.  While it has been ahuge success worldwide, the synopsis didn't wow me.  Luckily for me, the book did.  I sped read through this extremely well plotted epic with interesting unpredictable characters around every bend.  Sweden unfolds around mystery and intrigue and I thought I was there.  I'm now rushing to get the next book.  Great stuff!
0385523904|5.0|Quick comment to say that I'm reading it on the Kindle and it's been great. Naturally, like the other reviewers, I am thoroughly taken in by this book. I can't stop reading about it or talking about it. Demick's ability to create North Korea, as well as her ability to balance history, along with cultural and personal POVs, is a skill she deserves kudos for.      I haven't had my Kindle long and I worry about the difference between reading a book book versus an e-book but the e-book has been great. So if you're considering this book and you have a Kindle, download it today. You won't regret it.
B002OB9KPE|4.0|To the surprise of many, progressive rock supergroup Transatlantic decided to re-unite after a long hiatus in 2009 to put together their third studio album \\"The Whirlwind\\".  The band consists of Neil Morse (Spock's Beard), Pete Trawavas (Marillion), Roine Stolt (The Flower Kings) and Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater).  The album definitely has influences from all of the individual member's parent bands and is similar in style to the two previous albums.  \\"The Whirlwind\\" is basically one hour long track divided into 12 parts.  The material seems to lean heavily towards Neil Morse's writing and lyrical style, but all of the members have contributed bits and pieces here.  The lead vocals are probably 50% Neil as well, although all of the others take turns on several tracks.  The album's lyrics defiantly reflect Morse's Christianity in spots and may be too blatant for some tastes.  The instrumental passages on this album are very good, and it is especially cool to hear Pete Trawavas bass standing out throughout the album.  This may be his finest recorded performance.  Roine Stolt's guitar is also golden as his patented smooth style weaves its way in and out of the proceedings.  Overall I don't like this one quite as much as \\"Bridge Across Forever\\", but it is a good progressive rock album that should appeal to the band's fans.
0316001821|2.0|** SPOILERS**     I usually write reviews about books I have enjoyed reading, but I was so disappointed with this book that I felt compelled to write a review. First of all, those that liked the book have to keep in mind that not everyone is going to buy into the hype and be completely taken by it.  It was the movie trailer that sparked my interest in the book. The book started out promising but half way through it was nothing but drivel. I didn't like how she jumped from one character to the next. Susie's mother seemed like a bored housewife that decided to change her life by leaving her family for a few years. I can deal with the fact that they never found Susie's body, but having her killer die in such a pathetic way and not bringing him to justice was the most upsetting thing for me. I found it lame and trite and don't recommend it.

B0025X4P24|5.0|I have always been a fan of Vanessa, and this CD is definitely like the title says, \\"The Real Thing.\\"  This CD shows the maturity in her style. After doing R&B for so long, this is such a refreshing change. This CD shows the versatility of Vanessa. Not only is she a great actress, but also a great vocalist as well. Keep up the great work, Vanessa.
0385504225|5.0|I am not a literary critic, nor am I a college lit major, so I will not comment on the quality of the writing or editing. If it wasn't good, I didn't notice. I was captured by learning about the existence of noetic science (which studies the power of thought); I was excited by all the the new age themes including unity consciousness, numerology, astrology, and the passing down of secrets since the days of the pyramids in Egypt. I also liked learning about the free masons. I really appreciated the insights into the hidden meaning of the buildings in my nation's capital (check out William Henry's website and his DVD: FREEDOM'S GATE: DECODING THE SECRETS OF AMERICA'S TEMPLE OF ASCENSION for a visual journey through all of this information).  Best of all this novel supports my belief in the duality of humans (soul as a separate entity from the physical body and brain) and the possibility of humankind being able to create a better world using the focused thoughts of our mind. This book is a nail bitter, and I couldn't put it down for long. I highly recommend it to the new age crowd.
B002OHDRF2|3.0|Lots of action, but terminator2 still the best. T1is a classic action film. Ok but not as great as previous terminators.
0307269981|1.0|Amazon, please give reviewers the option of a 1/2 star-rating for those readers who have the sense to leave a bad book unfinished.
B002HWUU1I|4.0|Amazing followup collaboration from Glen Hansard and Marketa Iglova (the couple commonly referred to by tabloids as Glenketa - okay, not really). The album achieves momentum with lots of strong, soulful songs and beautiful musicianship.  Both the songwriting and the singing are so good.  I'd read in an interview that Glen and Marketa had ended the romantic aspect of their relationship (I can't imagine how intense it must be to collaborate in such a creative and beautiful way), but the songs on this record aren't bitter, awkward, or phoned-in.  Rather than feeling like a contract obligation, it's a brave example of life after romantic love and is every bit as \\"real\\" an album as anything either musician has ever done.    I do hope this effort doesn't delay Glen's participation in another Frames album, though!
0393312836|4.0|Highly entertaining. Infinitely better than the movie. It has some political viewpoints related to government interference into the lives of citizens for 'the better good'. Tis better to live in hell than to be chained in heaven. Only thing I didn't like was no annotation on the made up language which became tiresome after a bit.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter for Christmas.  It is light and upbeat as other reviews have noted even about love and heart break. It doesn't annoy me because I don't like listening to music that makes me feel all sad and depressed.  Heck I have enough of that in real life so this album is a nice emotional escape.  This CD is great for teens!  We will definatley buy more CD's from Taylor Swift in the future.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Seeing this movie again recently as an adult after fondly remembering it as a kid, it hasn't lost anything over the years. It remains a very charming, entertaining movie that fans of fantasy movies will enjoy regardless of their age. Starring a young Jennifer Connelly and David Bowie, the cast of characters also includes a diverse group of puppets from Jim Henson which are brought to life. The story is straightforward, but the characters make the movie very heart-warming and interesting.    Sarah is a teenager forced to babysit her brother who has a rich imagination, reading and acting out parts from a fairy tale which she then accidentally gets herself thrust into. When she wishes the Goblin King would take away her baby brother, he comes and does just that. In order to get the boy back, she must travel to the castle inside the center of a large labyrinth and confront the Goblin King Jareth within 13 hours.     Along her path in the labyrinth, Sarah encounters many different creatures. First she meets Hoggle, a dwarf whom she later discovers is acting under orders of Jareth to sabotage her efforts. Hoggle develops a fondness for Sarah however, and is torn between a desire to help her and his fear of Jareth. Learning that not everything is what it seems, she trusts and befriends Ludo, a giant beast who is actually quite gentle. Finally, she befriends Sir Didymus, a small knight who looks a little like a fox and uses a dog as his steed. There are many other fascinating characters discovered along the way, who are not always friendly.     In addition to the various characters, the movie also features several fun songs from David Bowie. Each song is well-suited to the situation and worked into the movie. Bowie himself is great as Jareth, the menacing (but not exactly scary) Goblin King. The goblins themselves are often silly - though they don't intend to be - and make you laugh. Jennifer Connelly is good in her role, but I think Bowie and the cast of puppets steal theshow. Overall, it's a very enjoyable, fun film.

0439023483|5.0|Every year a boy and a girl are chosen from each district to compete in the televised Hunger Games. Only one person may win the Hunger Games, by eliminating all of the competition. When Katniss Everdeen's sister is chosen to compete in the Hunger Games, Katniss comes forward to take her place. Katniss must make some incredibly tough decisions which I certainly do not envy.<br /><br />What can I say about the Hunger Games that hasn't already been said? I think Collins has hit on such an original concept. We've all read dystopian/post-apocalyptic novels before (HELLO 1984), I think Collins breathes some fresh air into the genre.<br /><br />I love that towns had to sacrifice their future, children, as tributes to the state. I mean if you can give up your kid to a televised bloodbath battle royale, clearly somebody must have a ridiculous amount of power over you.<br /><br />In all honesty, the Hunger Games made me feel ashamed of myself. I am a reality show addict, I can name most of the contestants from the VH1! of Love shows, VH1 Charm School, America's Next Top Model, and the list goes on. I wasn't a huge Survivor fan, but if there was something like the Hunger Games broadcast on TV, I would probably watch it. I mean, not if kids were really killing each other, but yeah. I know, that is horrible.<br /><br />Another thing which was fantastic about this book was the pace. I felt there was never a dull moment. I liked that the protagonist, Katniss, could hold my interest the whole way through. Plus she was kick-butt. It wasn't all about a male saving her. It was about her being a strong female. I appreciate when a YA book has a main female character who doesn't let people walk all over her.<br /><br />I definately recommend this book to anyone looking to be engrossed.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Incredible.........just incredible! I haven't been blown away by a movie in a long, long time. Do not wait for this film to come out on DVD! You gotta see it in the 3D format at the theaters! Miss it and you're missing something great and revolutionary! 10 out of 5 stars!
1595141979|5.0|Folks, I am absolutely not going to post the synopsis for Shadow Kiss by Richelle Mead, as it will spoil Frostbite for you. Let me tell you right now up front, if you want to read these books and be surprised by what happens and not spoiled absolutely do not read the synopsis for the books past Frostbite on Amazon. They will give away crucial plot points, which is pretty messed up for a synopsis.<br /><br />Anyways, Shadow Kiss picks up exactly where Frostbite left off. Holy hell. This book was an emotional roller coaster for me. We've got way more Rose plus Dimitri. We learn much more about Rose's ability. We see more of Adrian. There's more about Lissa's specialty.<br /><br />Let me say this book devastated me. It took my heart and ripped it to pieces. I just felt so much sorrow after reading this. I guess I really empathized with the character. It was so easy to slip into Rose, and feel the way that she feels. I will say that being in a committed long-term relationship really lent to my emotional heartache while reading this, because I know what it's like to be so deeply in love and can imagine how much it would suck to have someone ripped from me.<br /><br />Oh my god though, after finishing this, I wasn't sure if I wanted to move onto Blood Promise, as this book really did trample me and I'm nervous about the direction Richelle Mead is moving in. Also, that being said, there are certain scenes in Shadow Kiss which are pitch perfect, one of these scenes may contribute to this book being challenged by schools. Whatever. It's awesome. I would say Shadow Kiss is my favorite out of all of the VA books so far and absolutely worth a read if you want to go on the emo-coaster!
B001C08RHA|4.0|- Lots of action.  - Not too complex of a plot. This cost it a star in my book.    Overall, enjoyable.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|From my wife Sarah: Here's a review with an adult perspective. Having seen just about every movie playing in theaters, my girlfriend and I decided to catch this movie. It was very charming, full of laughs, and plenty of cuteness. I think that other adults will enjoy this film.<br /><br />There was plenty of laugh out loud humor in the story, and ultimately a very uplifting message about how important it is to work hard for your dreams, but to balance your life, putting love above everything.<br /><br />The music was beautifully composed, and Anika Noni Rose has the voice of an angel. When she sings, you feel all the emotion that goes with it, and her voice is so special. It's worth seeing this movie just for the music alone. Another show stopper was the song sung by a Cajun firebug named Ray. It was really lovely. I think some of these songs will become classics.<br /><br />The animation was often so beautiful that many a time I wished I could buy the film cells to put the still images on our walls. There were also times when the animation became flat and much less interesting. I'm not sure why they did this, but I'm sure most people won't notice it.<br /><br />The movie reflected the culture of New Orleans from the architecture to the food. This was certainly a new twist, and something I've never seen in an animated movie.<br /><br />One thing that people should know is that there's a lot of voodoo used in the story line. Not only was the evil character using voodoo, but the \\"fairy god mother equivelent\\" character was a voodoo high priestess who used voodoo to put things right. I personally wasn't thrilled with this. There are also demonic characters that the very sensitive might find scary.
0307454541|2.0|I have numerous complaints about this book, but the most salient is that it just wasn't that suspenseful. As a mystery, it nearly failed. That alone is a reason for me to not recommend this book.<br /><br />There are several other reasons to skip this book:<br />1) The author does what some people call 'core dumps'. Instead of piecewise revelations about the characters, there are 5+ page dumps of their life history, shoved clumsily into the middle of a scene. It was as if Larsson was frustrated that he had so many notes and details on his characters, and since he couldn't include the main characters' entire history in the actual story, he just wedged it in where it was handy. None of it helped the plot at all, it was mostly useless for understanding the characters, and it broke the narrative flow.<br />2) The Sweden of this book is populated with a sizable minority of sexual sadists. I, for one, could have done without some of the graphic descriptions of sexual violence that, as with the core dumps, added little to the story.<br />3) This book has two mysteries, unrelated except for the fact that a main player in one is tapped as the investigator in the other. It could have been two different books. It should have been two different books. Instead, we stop halfway through the business/financial mystery to solve the murder mystery, then clumsily stumble back into the business/financial mystery.<br />4) The author seems to enjoy having his characters participate in odd relationships. The male main character's relationship with his boss, for example, is complex and, as with many other things in this novel, more of a distraction from the story than actually relevant.<br />5) The female lead forgets who she is for the last chapter or two. Everything we know about her is thrown out the window as she reaches an unlikely conclusion, decides on an unlikely course of action, confronts something that she not only already knew but shouldn't have been terribly troubled by, then reacts in a way that made no sense.<br />6) The author has a habit of giving the full technical specs of computers. Again, totally irrelevant, and distracting.<br /><br />Had the murder mystery been riveting, i might have been able to ignore or forgive some of these problems, but it just wasn't. I guessed the resolution fairly early on. This book not only fails to live up to the hype, but just isn't very good.sense.   6) The author has a habit of giving the full technical specs of computers.

0743298039|5.0|Synopsis: Margaret Lea occasionally writes biographies of obscure figures in history, and works in her father's rare book store. She lives a lonely and solitary life haunted by a devastating loss that has shattered her family. One day she receives a letter from Vida Winter, a bestselling author who is known for telling a variety of versions of her life story, none of which are assumed to be true. Ms Winter requests Margaret to come to her home and write her biography, and promises this time to tell the truth. Margaret can not resist this offer and travels to Ms Winter's home for what she thinks will be a short stay and simple write up of the story. What she finds instead is a mysterious and compelling tale of family, ghosts and tragedy that draws her in and changes her irrevocably.    This is not just a good story, it is a homage to stories, the ones that are invented and the ones we invent about our own lives and hold to be true. It is multi-layered with stories within stories within stories. Ms Winter's truth is revealed slowly, with the mystery unfolding at just the right pace to keep me interested and wanting to read just a little more before turning the light off and going to bed. I had a few late nights with this book! I have read other reviews that state the mystery is easily solved and obvious, but I didn't pick it, and when it was fully revealed, and Margaret's story is fully revealed I was deeply moved. I thought about this book long after I had finished it, and needed several days to let it all sink in before I was ready to move onto another book - not something that happens to me very often. This is a perfect book for cold winter nights or rainy days snugged up on the couch. I am really looking forward to her new book which I believe will be released this year (although I can't find any information about what this book is called or what it is about).
B000N2HCM4|5.0|When I downloaded the sample chapters of this book on my Kindle, I was expecting a yawn. Either it was going to be a lawyer's autobiography (overly analytical and dry) or a politician's (self-agrandizing and repetitive). It is far from either of those! The revised prologue by then candidate Obama explains how he was ambivalent about its re-release, and he himself re-read it expecting to cringe, but apart from a few parts, he would still have written the book the same ten years later.  The body of the book is superbly written. It steers clear from soapbox rants and generalizations, and in a very disciplined way, follows the path of the author's development, social, emotional and intellectual. He is uncompromising in his self-evaluation, often very hard on his own setbacks and lack of understanding. What I most appreciate is his clear-eyed view of race relations, with intimate appreciation for different people's perspectives and experiences, fears and desires. He is unflinchingly direct and fair on a topic that is, at best, touchy.  His prose is remarkably lovely, well-crafted and exacting in its vocabulary. People, himself included, are viewed in all their complexities, contradictions and limitations, with care and concern for each. He strikes at the universality of the human experience even as that experience forms a wedge between them, and follows his own path as a dreamer facing the ugly realities of life. A book I truly savored and cherished reading.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I was really confused in the third season and about to give up on the series, but I stuck with it and WOW, the fifth season is the best ever.  I can watch each episode at least twice in a row and sometimes 3 times to catch everything.  These collection of actors are superb and are their finest performances to date.  Terry O'Quinn is fantastic as always and just such a joy to watch.  Love Jorge Garcia's funny scenes.  Anyway, a great collection to have.
0786838655|5.0|Percy Jackson is about to be kicked out of yet another boarding school.  But before that can happen, his algebra teacher attacks him and he overhears a conversation where he is being discussed.<br /><br />While those things are weird, they are nothing to what happens when he gets home.  A weekend away with his mom turns into a run for their lives as Percy learns an amazing fact about his father.  Soon, he is given a quest.  With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, can Percy find the lightning thief?<br /><br />Yep, I'm one of those people who picked up this book because of the movie coming next month.  But I've got to say I am glad I did.  This is a fun story from start to finish.  Yes, parts feel borrowed from Harry Potter, but then again Harry borrowed from what came before as well.  This book also takes plenty of great twists of its own.  And I really loved Percy and his friends.<br /><br />Granted, the plot could have been better.  I figured a few things out early, and it did get bogged down a little before Percy gets his quest.  Even so, I was so engrossed in his world that I really didn't care.<br /><br />I am going to have to get the rest of the books in this great series.  And now I really can't wait for the movie.

I TRULY LOVED this book, but then again - I adore Ozzy and it's PURE OZZY at his most bare and truthful (and witty)! What a rare treat inside his sweet and crazy mind! I only wish this book could have gone on forever!
B00275EGWY|3.0|I was looking forward to watching this after a mild-mannered friend couldn't stop talking about it. This is someone who rarely talks about anything so if he mentions that a certain movie is real good, then I will listen carefully.  Of course there are a lot of good reviews from paid critics as well. After seeing this, I can see why the critics love it. The acting and the nature of the story playing out on screen is superb. There is a lot of good war movies out there and the approach here was different in a good way, but I wouldn't say it's the most entertaining. I don't think it's a must-see movie. I agree with most of the reviewers about how gritty and raw the film-making is but if you watch a movie to be entertained, then I don't think this thrives in that category. I'm glad I watched it as it was worth my time and money but I don't think I would be missing out on a whole lot if I didn't. It's a GOOD movie, not a GREAT one. That's all I'm saying.
B001XRLWPQ|4.0|I love snappy dialog, and Castle has it in spades. For the Nathan Fillion/Firefly/Serenity fans out there, welcome home. But don't overlook Stana Katic. She is a very capable actor who really knows how to act with expressions without being melodramatic about it.     Each episode gets better and better. Each show is totally stand-alone, but you want to watch them in order because Castle and Beckett grow and mature as individual characters and as a dynamic duo. The result is that the show starts out very formula but adds depth with each episode until the season finally when the game Castle and Beckett have been playing all season steps over a line and becomes stops being a game.     As a mid-season replacement, there are only 10 episodes in this \\"Complete First Season\\", so know that going in. But considering that I think each episode is worth two of most other series out there, it is still a bargain. The initial episodes have expired off the hulu server, but you can get them on iTunes or possible here on Amazon. So if this first season DVD set is your introduction to Castle, then you can get your next fix immediately with the episodes of season 2 released to date to get you fully up to date with the series.
0743277465|5.0|This book is a Gem. It is one of those books that any intelligent or serious person will learn something worth remembering from. Josh succeeds in telling the way his mind works, the way he has reached greatness without any pretentiousness. As he knows, along with everyone really talented that overconfidence, pretentiousness, dishonesty hinder performance. Has the potential to be a truly life changing book. Someone with no knowledge of chess may have to let a few things go over his or her head. Without any knowledge of tai chi before hand everything he wrote about it made perfect sense to me.
B0019LY5IM|1.0|I collect LOST box sets since day one, loved the way they looked, it was the most fancy good-looking boxes in my 400+ dvd collection. Why change it now? Two seasons to the end? Was it REALLY necessary? BE AWARE, this box set does not have that vivid plastic box glove that made this series to be the most beautiful on the shelf. It comes in that cheap low-quality small-cost old-looking cardboard box.
B002BU0DPE|3.0|Overall these are decent headphones but I have few little niggles that many of the other reviews have already noted.  I bought these primarily for my son, so that he wasn't blasting the the big system all night long. After using these a few times I picked up a set of Tritton AX pros for myself, as these just weren't up to snuff in my book, although my 12 year old loves them.<br /><br />  I can't really compare sound quality as my primary surround system comprises of Marantz Preamp and amp coupled to Martin Logan electrostats, my gaming headset are AX Pros, and my music headsets are Grado reference. You can't compare apples to figs, but I suppose they do sound OK for what they are. The amp gain noise of these is pretty atrocious though, magnified 10x when you turn on the sound expander.  The mute button is difficult to negotiate in the middle of a heated battle.  Chat boost seems to only be a gimmick and there is no discernible difference with it enabled or not.  After calibrating to reduce mic echo these are pretty decent being used only for communication.  The ear cups are quite comfortable and outside sound passes through fairly well, useful if you wish to use them for communication only.  The mic boom feels quite flimsy and I'm afraid that my son will break it, but only time will tell.  Overall build quality is ok, I can't say on par for the price, but it is just ok.<br /><br />Those that claim these to be surround, these are 2 channel. Those that say that these are the best around have not looked around.  These do the job for the price, but that's about it and there are better for the same price.  Be prepared for mediocrity.  I've compared these with a neighbor's [[ASIN:B002P77432 Tritton Universal Gaming Headset]] and the trittons are leaps and bounds ahead of these and about the same price.

B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I have already tested this mic out and it is perfect for my needs. I am using it with my Kodak Zi8.  I use it in retail locations and at trade shows and this mic is great!  It offers great sound, the long cord is very handy, good battery life and is so small and easy to stow that it just adds to the ease of use.  I haven't found anything not to like about this mic.  For the buyer who complained about the audio level using his Kodak Zi8... adjust the mic volume level on the settings menu of your camera before you record. Clear sound, long cord, great price.  I found this mic through a blog and was happy to give him a hit by using his link.  See what he has to say about it too as his test was what originally warmed me up to the idea of purchasing. [...]

B002HWRYJE|3.0|This first time I saw this flick was in a theater and I fell asleep at some point and, upon awakening, understandably couldn't make any sense out of it.  I decided to  give it a second chance on DVD now that I have a large screen at home.  I then picked up on one of the things that bothered me about this picture:  the camera work.  I realized that the cinematographer went out of his way to make it look as if he were using a hand-held camera.  The picture constantly jerks one way and then the other and it's obvious that it's being intentionally done for dramatic effect, which is both pretentious and annoying.  All it accomplishes is to make you aware of the camera when you're supposed be aware of the characters and the story and not the camera.      The choice of players is pretty good.  Kirk portrayed as a little kid comes off as the world's worst brat whose ability to maneuver a car at that age is completely unbelievable.  The story is generally engrossing and the special effects are what you would expect these days.  The pacing of the film makes it resemble a sci-fi version of a Bourne film with no shot lasting more than 1.2 seconds.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This series can stand proudly beside \\"The Shield\\" in terms of quality. The acting is great and the episodes are driven by the characters who are all walking that very thin line of good and evil. Katey Segal as the mother is my favorite, you truly believe she would bite the head off her young without hesitation to preserve the legacy of the Sons of Anarchy. The story whips along with zinger one liners, graphic violence and macho posturing - all adding up to one great ride.
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning being Metallica's 2nd studio album and their 1984 release is truly an incredible album. The album has produced some of the best thrash metal that I have ever listened to. The songs that I especially like are \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls \\" and \\"Fade To Black\\". All the lyrics are included in the book along with some photos of the band. We also get a list over whom plays what. The album was met with rave reviews by the critics. Allmusic and Kerrang! both giving the album very high marks in their reviews. 5/5.
B002E01LL6|3.0|The main problem with a film like 'Fighting' is the expectations that come with the obvious - fighting, or fight sequences. Although the movie centers on fighting, it seems like attention was spent elsewhere. In other words, the filmmakers did not conceptualize intricate fight sequences that would leave Bruce Lee breathless. On the contrary, the fights here are very low brow, meat and potatoes, bare knuckle, anything goes kind of brawl, which I'm not opposed to whatsoever. Personally, every now and again, the over-orchestrating of fight sequences can be a bit too much for me, but the minimal aspects here lend quite nicely to the main character's plight to survive.     As you've probably read the other reviews, the story surrounds the nicest small-time drifter once could ever hope to meet (quite a stretch I may add). He holds doors for strangers, pays fair prices for goods and aside from the funky smell & shabby clothes, you'd be proud to bring him home to mother for Thanksgiving dinner. Although money is the object of his desire, he struggles to keep the only thing he's got going for himself - his pride. Something from his past that has made him run but must soon face head on. Howard stars as a small time conman with connections but in his older age, he represents the road Tatum could be headed. He takes him under his wing, primarily for the potential of making plenty of dough but soon realizes that a life without dignity isn't worth much. For example, to Howard, throwing a fight seems like smart business-making but for Tatum it means letting go of your most fundamental values as a person.     I enjoyed the movie for what it was worth although I could clearly see the potential for a deeper, more soulful searching between the characters. Although it failed to deliver the latter, it was consistently paced well. If you have some time to kill, not expecting to see anything remotely close to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you like Terrence Howard or Channing Tatum (or dare I say like both of them), have washed your hair twice in one evening already and finished that 1500 piece jigsaw puzzle, then do give this a watch. I have seen better but I have definitely endured worse.     On a minor note, I believe someone mentioned the love interest's mother as cliché'; I definitely agree although it was indeed her grandma, not her mom.
0061914177|5.0|I loved this book.   Only improvement that can be made is elaborating on developing a personal brand, beyond just \\"do what you love\\" statement. More Gary V's insight to adding personality to business, creating an amazing customer experience, managing time/brand as it picks up speed etc.
0670021652|5.0|Reading Liz Gilbert is like savoring a long letter from your smartest, coolest girlfriend.  Committed is a departure from her previous book (and she's written several other successful books, which allowed her to make the adventure-filled and healing voyages she wrote about in Eat Pray Love).<br /><br />People generally have strong feelings about Eat Pray Love - they love it or they really don't love it.  I first spotted a recommendation for it in Philadelphia Magazine and was later given a copy by a friend who thought I could use it at the time.  Boy, was she right.  If you can't relate to Liz's struggles and triumphs, you have probably not ever been divorced.<br /><br />Liz is now fully recovered from her divorce, well, she would say, as recovered as you can be, though it took years.  Committed is part sociology and part-autobiography, an explanation of how she ended up married again after swearing off matrimony forever, as did her new partner.  She deals with setbacks not only by traveling but by researching - in this case, a good sifting of marriage customs throughout history.<br /><br />The parts about the women in her family are fascinating examples of what women in different generations have had to deal with as feminism blossomed in the twentieth century.  If you have not read Stephanie Coontz's book Marriage: A History (which I keep meaning to), you will find this an eye-opening challenge to common beliefs about marriage, and you will learn how many of them evolved, when the church became involved in marriage, and what amazingly tolerant customs exist in other countries, such as Iran.<br /><br />Some interesting tidbits: As soon as people stop marrying for pragmatic reasons (such<br />as family mergers, economics, and community pressures) and start marrying for love, divorce rates soar.  Second marriages are not statistically doomed after all.  A Rutgers study listing the seven features enduring marriages have in common will have you taking inventory of your current and past relationships.  Surprisingly, one element that does not improve a marriage is having children at home -- the study found that higher-satisfaction marriages involve children who are grown or no children.<br /><br />Another survey noted that the quality young women most want in a husband is his ability to \\"inspire\\" them, whereas the wished-for qualities in the 1920s were more commonly \\"decency\\" or the ability to provide. And have you heard about the Marriage Benefit Imbalance?  It's not good news for women, since marriage statistically puts them behind in terms of health, wealth, happiness, risk for violence, and life expectancy, while doing just the opposite for men.  So why do so many women want it so much?  The author attempts to answer this too.<br /><br />Thank you, Liz, for pointing out the common sense reasons for legalizing gay marriage.  That only made me like her more.<br /><br />I enjoyed the unusual format of non-fiction mixed with personal story and look forward to seeing this author at the Free Library.  I think I would enjoy anything by Elizabeth Gilbert because of her warmth and wit, her ability to admit her own failings, and her creative ways of tackling both interesting subjects as well as life's challenges.current and past relationships.

0446567337|4.0|John Tyree is a sergeant in the Army on leave when a chance encounter with Savannah Lynn Curtis changes everything he knows.    Sparks has long been the author of my favorite book ever, A WALK TO REMEMBER, and I've kind of been on a Sparks hiatus for a while. His books always bring me to the brink of every emotion and DEAR JOHN was no exception. I picked up this book because I wanted to read it before the movie came out; however it's been sitting on my shelves since 2006 when it was originally published.    Sparks is an author who created characters that breathe life to the pages of each book and add such dimension and beauty to the story being told. I finished this book within 24 hours and I haven't done that since I read HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. John and Savannah's story was beautiful and rich and honest. Sparks writes an emotional tale about what true love really means, and I am glad that I found my way back to this author.    This is definitely a tissue read as most Sparks books tend to be, but not only for sad and lonely reasons, but for way that he chose to close his story.
1560100842|5.0|Preston Blair, The original animator of Mickey Mouse!  This book is fun, informative, thorough and well organized.    Most animation students buy, \\"The illusion of life,\\" by Ollie Johnston and Frank Thomas,  But Preston Blair's, \\"Cartoon Animation,\\" is without a doubt, the definitive precursor to such a textbook.    He explains in detail, how to create the illusion of 3d on a 2d cartoon, how to lip sync, and how to design a character's unique movement patterns.   All in all, if you're looking to be an animator, this is the book for you!
B001HN69AO|4.0|Are you ever in the mood for something fresh and original? Are you tired of all the safe movies designed for the masses? Well, take a trip through the mirror of Doctor Parnassus. Terry Gilliam is a love him or hate him type of director, but for some reason I'm more of in the middle. I like half or so of his films and just don't get the appeal of the others. In this case, I loved just about every second of it.<br /><br />Most people know that this was Heath Ledger's last role and that he died during the filming process, but what surprised me was how much he is actually in the movie. I would say around 50% of it. His performance is really good here as expected. He totally dropped the Joker influence completely and showed us once again that we were looking at a guy who had just begun to scratch the surface of his talent. Christopher Plummer (Doctor Parnassus) and Tom Waits (Satan) both turn in equally excellent acting showcases. Even newcomer Lily Cole does a good job and is very nice to look at to boot. Verne \\"Mini-Me\\" Troyer is not the best actor in the world, but he seems to be trying hard and is given a couple of good lines. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell fill in the gaps that Ledger could obviously not. Depp gets the least amount of time, but all three bring the right amount skill to each \\"tribute\\" version of Ledger's character. Since Ledger was able to film all the reality parts before his death, his ever changing look could easily be explained in the fantasy realm.<br /><br />The visuals and music are wacky as can be, but in a good way. It's nice to see so much imagination and unique storytelling in modern cinema. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is not for everyone, but I think most who give it a shot will find themselves lost in the the mind of one stange filmmaker.
B001E75QGG|4.0|Despite my deep geek side wanting to, I resisted the temptation to go see Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull at the \\"12:01\\" screening. I decided that I had waited 19 years for a new Indy, I could wait 'til Thursday morning. So when I was talking to a friend about it at 12:15, his response was \\"I heard it sucks.\\" An odd thing to hear about a movie that had been out for about fourteen minutes and really had probably not even started yet when you consider the trailers. I pointed this fact out to him. \\"Oh but the reviews are bad,\\" he said. The reality again is that the reviews, while not stellar, have not been bad. The movie has floated between 77-80% freshness on RottenTomatoes, and that percentage has been increasing, not declining, as it opens nationwide.<br /><br />  But people \\"hear\\" it'll suck. Indiana Jones 4, it seems, exists in a new era of franchise films. A post-Star Wars Prequel movie going climate. The era of negative buzz. Indy 4 is being assumed by the pre-viewing audience to be something that will suck. It's bringing back something we loved from our childhood, and surely they can't do anything good with that. \\"This movie will suck.\\"<br /><br />  But it doesn't suck. Far from it in fact. Watching it today, and thoroughly enjoying it while I did so, I found myself wondering exactly what kind of movie people are expecting it to be. Because of course Crystal Skull is not going to be this year's The Departed or No Country For Old Men. It's Indiana Jones! It's a summer blockbuster action film at its heart, and it lives up to that promise with great skill. It is in no way a black mark on the Indiana Jones series, and fans of the original trilogy should have no problems setting it on the shelf with the other three.<br /><br />  It isn't a perfect movie. I think they try a little too hard to explain what has been happening in Indy's life during the interim, wedging in exposition when unnecessary. And there are some convoluted moments, sure, probably the two biggest involve a nuclear explosion and Tarzan-like vine swinging. But all of these movies have convoluted moments, giant boulders, mine car chases, zeppelin dog-fighting. And as the secrets of the titular Skull is revealed, some might roll their eyes and think \\"lame.\\" But I ask Indy fans, is it any less a stretch of the imagination that a mystical Ark, when opened, will melt all who don't look away? Or that a man can rip someone's beating heart out of his chest and have it burst into flames when he falls into lava? For the water from the right cup to heal wounds while the wrong will melt a Nazi good? I say no. Indy doesn't do \\"realism.\\"<br /><br />  What Indy does is fun action, with a little humor mixed in. I'd say the vast majority of the action in this movie works, with only a couple of \\"oh come on, really?!\\" moments that briefly take you out if the movie (see previous reference to Tarzan.) The crux of which is the caravan chase slash fight slash jump from vehicle to vehicle sequence that is basically the staple of the franchise, having been used in every movie save for Temple of Doom. It does not fail to entertain in this film just as it hasn't in the previous two.<br /><br />  And Ford delivers. One of the biggest \\"it's going to suck\\" complaints I have heard about the movie is that he is too old. This *might* be a valid complaint if it weren't for the fact that Harrison Ford has been putting out action movies on a somewhat regular basis, the most recent being 2006's Firewall. And he's also the exact same age his Last Crusade co-star Sean Connery was when he made The Rock. There are a couple of moments in fight scenes where a shadow on Indy's face suggests maybe Ford wasn't doing the stunt himself, but for the most part it is clearly him, and I also welcome the occasional stuntman over the CGI mess that most action movies today feature.<br /><br />  The supporting case is strong, Karen Allen is a welcome return as Marion, and Shia La Beouf does not usurp the focus of the movie from it's rightful place on Indy. I'm always happy to see John Hurt and his crazed professor is a much less malicious and intimidating character than his V For Vendetta Adam Sutler. And the Soviets do not make any less of a quality villain than those Nazis, especially with Cate Blanchett at the helm. Oh and Scrubs' Janitor, Neil Flynn is in it!<br /><br />  It's hard to really make an official judgement call on where it ranks among the Indiana Jones series, considering I have two decades of nostalgia built up from the others, but having only seen it once I would say it falls somewhere behind Raiders and Crusade, but is better than Temple of Doom. All four movies continue to keep me as a fan, and if it could be as good as this one, I would gladly go see a fifth.rightful place on Indy.

B002SR2PKG|4.0|\\"It\\" is the third Stephen King novel I read (after The Shining and The Stand).  Although very long, it makes for compulsive reading.  I couldn't put it down during the year-end holidays.  The story is very good.  A small city in Maine is periodically purged by an unseen evil that is often associated with the presence of a grotesque clown.  A group of child \\"Losers\\", outcasts for various reasons, manages to escape this redoutable presence and after a quarter century returns (with some attrition) to finish the job they started but neglected to finish.  Members of the group are very well fleshed out and the interplay between their youthful and adult personae is diverting.  The horror is also very well rendered and there is continuous suspense.<br /><br />I have just a few quibbles.  The sex bit, to which I won't refer in order not to spoil the reading for others, is unnecessary and very creepy, not horror-book creepy but real-life creepy.  It seems tacked on the rest of the book, does nothing for it and rather tarnishes it.  Although the Turtle is hinted at early in the book the scenes featuring this character are unsatisfactory.  More detail would have been nice.  If there is only one It in the entire universe and it has always resided in what would later be known as Derry, Maine, it doesn't make any sense of the Ch&uuml;d Ritual to come up in a Nepalese scroll (how would the Nepalese have known about It?).  Also the scenes concerning this Ritual do not match what the Ritual supposedly was about (joke telling, laughing, etc.).  Even though elements of horror story elements may be ridiculous in themselves the conventions of the genre require that they be taken entirely seriously for the story to hold together.<br /><br />This is not to say the book was unamusing.  It is spellbinding, almost Proustian in its remembrance of the joys of childhood and full of popular 1950s culture details (music, TV programs, slang, movies) that give a certain weightiness not normally present in horror books.  And, as a horror book it is very good.  What better antagonist than one that may look and act like what each person fears the most?  And what place is scarier than the tubes and ducts that are the modern equivalent of catacombs?<br /><br />If I were allowed to rate the Kindle version I read I'd give it 1 star.  The software they used to copy the printed version into Kindle format still needs a lot of work.  It misreads many letters and punctuation symbols, sometimes to hilarious effect.  Of course it is fairly easy to read through these mistakes, but they slow the reading down and spoil it a bit.  Horror stories should be read breathlessly so that one forgets the act of reading and is totally engrossed in the story.  I recommend to whoever is responsible for these things to pay someone to proofread the books before they're sold over amazon.com.

As much as I do very much want to see that movie, based on a book by Neil Gaiman, who I consider to be perhaps today's definitive master of fantasy, I was sidetracked by a listing of a special showing going on in at the same theater.  That would be the phrase \\"Jim Henson's Labyrinth.\\"<br /><br />  My heart indeed skipped a beat when I saw this.  With all due respect to Mr. Gaiman, Stardust will still be playing in theaters next week, but a special screening of a Jim Henson movie is not to be missed.  I will say that I have long felt that the loss of Henson is one of the truest tragedies of the modern creative age, everything the man did was full of such odd twists and turns, taking things to levels of originality and imagination far outreaching the majority of his peers, and Labyrinth is a prime example of that.<br /><br />  I was apprehensive at first going in, almost even deciding to see Stardust instead, feeling that maybe it would be better to see something new than risk tarnishing the memory of a movie I had not seen in well over a decade.  Well the call of muppets cannot be denied and so I ended up taking the risk and I'm glad I did.  While the usage of synthesizers and the presence of a very-era David Bowie certainly date the movie, they don't distract from the enjoyment of it, and I even remember why I had such a massive crush at one point on Jennifer Connelly.<br /><br />  I'm a big fan in general of the Muppets and Fraggle Rock, but what impresses me about Labyrinth and its predecessor, the Dark Crystal, is the ability to take the same level of imagination directed towards those worlds and channel them into an entirely different universe, with a magic all its own, a place where Kermit the Frog and crew would be entirely foreign concepts.  Labyrinth creates a world where a glam rock idol rules over an army of goblins, goblins who use weapons which are made up of other goblins.  A world where a giant Yeti monster controls summons rocks with his yell because they're his friends, and where a noble fox with an eyepatch rides a dog into battle.<br /><br />  With all the above mentioned insanity, it seems like it would be hard to point out something that sums up what makes Labyrinth such an amazing piece of film.  However, for me, it happens in a scene about midway through the movie. Hoggle, the cowardly little creature who leads heroine Sarah through various parts of the labyrinth is searching for her and is interrupted by Jareth the Goblin King, but first passes a piece of stone that is shaped like a face.  As he moves past the face, we see that it is in fact three separate pieces that form one single image when seen directly in front of the camera.  This face is probably visible on film for a matter of seconds, if that, and is then broken apart as the angle moves away from the rocks.  Yet Henson and crew found this detail important enough to spend time cutting material, designing a set, and placing the rocks in exactly the right spot, hoping that at least one viewer would catch ithich are made up of other goblins.

B000MXPE88|4.0|This movie got very interesting reviews that some people like and some dislike. I'd like to interpret it anyhow you should get some kind of strong impression after watching this film which is either good or not. Only I can say is it was worth watching.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|I went to a movie the other night. It had been a while since I had been to one because of all the good stuff life brings (job, bills, the overall daily rigamarol). As it was now a rare occasion to go to the movies, I wanted something that truly exemplified a summer movie experience...and no, I'm not talking about Iron Man (while a great movie in its own right, I'm gonna say its slightly overated...so nyah ;). I'm talking IMAX time, folks. And I'm talking Speed Racer!<br /><br />  Now, I know, I know. \\"Rotten Tomatoes has it at 35% rotten!\\" and \\"It looks like it's a kids movie!\\". Raspberries all around! Pffffffffffft!!! Yes, Speed Racer is a family flick. And yes, the reviews (of which I follow almost religiously) have panned the movie mercilessly. Yet, it seems as if it is a movie that Hollywood and the viewing public just threw out in lieu of other things...other things not as amazingly trippy.(see What Happens In Vegas review by Rye Silverman.)<br /><br />  I am not a fan of Speed Racer. I have seen a few eps during my youth and thought they were aight. Yet, I knew the film was magic because I believed in the Bros. Wachowski (even if Larry got that sex change operation, they're still the bros to me), the masterminds behind Bound and Matrix. Yes, I believed in their revolution, even if I didn't believe in their Revolutions. Sometimes, one has to trust in the imaginations of others. Even though the last two Matrix installments blew chunks pretty Speed Racer Christina Riccimuch, the Wachowskis could never be considered lacking in the imagination department. They are mavericks like Tarantino, Rodriguez, etc. People who are trailblazing...and bombing at the box office on the regular (see: Grindhouse...no, seriously F%C#IN see Grindhouse!)<br /><br />  Audiences must not have been aware of the radical departure from the norm Speed Racer is. It is long, with an over two hour running time, yet you can't really feel it because you are too busy seizuring out on the floor, your eyes melting as your body turns to gleeful mush. It felt like what it was like to be a kid again and first go on the \\"Gravitron\\". It felt like the first roller coaster. It felt fresh for once, not phoned in like so many other blockbusters these days. I almost fell to the floor when I stood up to leave, but it was a good dizziness, and an exhalted nausea!<br /><br />  So, I beg and plead with you. Here my inept cry (caw!...cough...caw!): this is a movie that anyone can see (except those with vertigo) and smile. It takes you into the first live action cartoon, with a blending of HD tech and a layering effect never before used. The acting is well done, the plot is serviceable, and the experience...the experience is pure cinematic gold.<br /><br />p.s.- I have gone around my job hyping this film in hopes of saving it from its crappy box office. I now sound like a mad lunatic who has taken one too many tabs of acid. Well, I never took acid, I took Speed, and it was the best movie experience this year.<br /><br />p.p.s- There's a monkey in the film who's ACTUALLY funny! See it already!!!s your body turns to gleeful mush. It felt like what it was like to be a kid again and first go on the \\"Gravitron\\". It felt like the first roller coaster.

B001BLSEIW|5.0|Lots of reviews on this one so I wanted to add this is the best available sound quality I have found on a cd of this name to date. I of course have the previous Japanese release which while very good in fidelity as cd's go, does not possess the same level of detail and 'air' about it. Not that the difference is obvious, it is however significant to me on my speakers and headphones with careful listening. While I cannot say for sure it is the touted SHM coating and/or the mastering and/or just extra care in manufacturing, it is worth the additional cost over the regular cd if this is one of your favorites and/or if your a dedicated audiophile. (For me it is both a favorite vintage album and I am a dedicated audiophile)  Audiophile- Someone who is always searching for higher quality sound reproduction.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|The last Wes Anderson movie, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, was the one that began to elicit a few cries of lost magic from former die hard fans turned burnt out turncoats.  It was certainly the broadest reaching of his works, an episodic plot featuring turns including pirate attacks and what ultimately proved to be an untrue father-son reconciliation.<br /><br />  The Darjeeling Limited has had its share of haven't-even-seen-it-yet detractors who also claim that Anderson has lost whatever it is he used to have.  Others have suggested that his work continues to show its seams to the audience, that it is a cinematic mad-lib of artistic cinematography combined with highly strategic music.<br /><br />  I agree with pretty much everything about that line of thought towards the Anderson movies. He has shown himself by this point to be essentially a one-trick pony.  With the exception of his debut Bottle Rocket, his movies have dealt exclusively with the longings and emptiness of the lives of over-privileged white people, typically selfish yet endearing in a quirky way, with a soundtrack that was clearly planned before dialogue was even written, and apparently an appearance by Bill Murray and Angelica Houston.<br /><br />  But the thing is, it works.  Perhaps I'm something of an apologist, because despite knowing all of the above, I still continually find myself sucked into the world he paints, I connect with his characters and I even find myself searching iTunes for the soundtrack.  And so it is safe to say Darjeeling Limited had me as soon as I was introduced to all three of its main characters, the Whitman brothers, played by Owen Wilson, Adrian Brody, and Jason Schwartzman, three rich American brothers riding a train across India.<br /><br />  The Darjeeling Limited, despite it's road movie backdrop, is likely the smallest, most claustrophobic of Anderson's movies to date.  It maintains such a close portrait of its three main protagonists, who are so rarely separated from one another that even when the boys are kicked off the train for fighting, or the worlds apart the characters seem from each other at times, the movie never really feels like it leaves the close confines of their shared cabin.<br /><br />  So while watching an Anderson film is an experience of familiarity with his previous works, to me it never comes off as redundant. It feels very much like looking at a series of paintings by the same artist during the same period of his life, looking deeply for a level of truth in slivers of the same image, with only a few slight variations, that when pondered more seem to make an immense difference.at even when the boys are kicked off the train for fighting, or the worlds apart the characters seem from each other at times, the movie never really feels like it leaves the close confines of their shared cabin.

B001GAPC1K|4.0|Iron Man is a character that I never in my history of comic book fandom cared about. When talk first started circulating about an Iron Man movie, my thought was \\"I guess they're hitting them all eventually,\\" considering that we've already been subjected to Ghost Rider and Daredevil/Elektra. Especially now that Marvel has founded their very own studio so that they can produce movies themselves instead of selling the rights and points on the back end to others, it seems fairly certain that their catalog of heroes isn't going to be closing itself off to the multiplex any time soon.<br /><br />  But after seeing Iron Man, I'm sort of ok with that. Provided of course, that the movies they make are more like Iron Man and less like the Fantastic Four franchise. It isn't that Iron Man is any amazing special film, but it isn't terrible. In the spectrum of superhero movies, it falls somewhere maybe slightly behind the first X-Men, but well in front of the awful third one. It isn't Spiderman II, Hellboy, or Batman Begins. But it certainly isn't Daredevil.<br /><br />  There is one thing and one thing alone that makes Iron Man such an enjoyable movie. Robert Downey Jr. The script is ok, and Jon Favreau does a pretty decent ass job in the director's chair for it too, but it is Downey that carries the weight of the movie on his metal clad shoulders. He plays Tony Stark with such a flair for delightful bastardness, yet does not fall short at the moments when he must also show real emotion, real conflict as his character realizes his place in the world.<br /><br />  Downey brings to the table the most enjoyable performance in a popcorn movie since Johnny Depp set sail as Captain Jack Sparrow in the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Despite Stark's personal conflicts, he is the least angst-ridden super hero in recent memory, delighting in every moment he spends refining and eventually kicking evil ass in his suit. It is an interesting twist on the paradigm of the costumed hero that Stark is more weighed down by the impact on the world he has created as a normal person, albeit a larger than life normal person, than he does as a costumed crusader. His joy in being a superhero reminds us of something often forgotten in many of the overly dark failures in comic book adaptations the last few years, the reason so many little kids want to be superheroes in the first place: it looks kind of fun.weighed down by the impact on the world he has created as a normal person, albeit a larger than life normal person, than he does as a costumed crusader.

B00005QGAT|5.0|i love this album.. I grew up listening to Michael jackson and I was born when he was at the height of his career in 1982... Everyone in my family wanted to meet him and wanted to be him.. I think this album was probably the best album he has ever done. Although thriller took him to the next level but on this album he has a lot of classics and a lot of soul to it.I remember hearing stories about when michael and his brothers came to houston for there tours and it was the best concert u could have ever seen.. I wish I was born during the 70s just to see him in the height of his success. but he will live on through his music and the changes that he has made to the music industry in the 80s because that is what made him happy, Loving music and his fans!!!

B001YV502C|4.0|Imagine being famous for nothing more than your age. Do your parents even know how old you are down to the minute? Imagine the entire world knowing.<br /><br />  Children of Men takes the audience on a wild ride with a somewhat downtrodden hero named Theo, portrayed by Clive Owen.<br /><br />  On the run from an English government that persecutes individuals of any other nationality and an activist group that wants to claim an unborn baby as their own, Theo is thrust into a game of deceit and betrayal orchestrated by a society obsessed with a hope for new life. With the help of a handful of selfless individuals, Theo strives to save the unborn child. Through his adventure, without knowing it, he begins to revive something inside himself that has been dormant since the death of his own son.<br /><br />  Steadicam shots and hand held camera movement bestow a documentary style on this film, which is set 20 years in the future. In some scenes the audio track becomes a character of its own, guiding the audience through long shots absent of dialogue. Dark, dirty scenes create a feeling of despair that is mirrored in the characters on screen. Still the actions of those characters, allow the audience to see current ideologies in the not so distant future, which brings to light many of our selfish ideas.<br /><br />  As the sounds of the playground faded, the despair set it,\\" a nurse accompanying our hero on his mission says as the two wander the deserted classrooms of an dilapidating elementary school.<br /><br />  Beautiful long camera shots pull the audience into the world through Theo's eyes as he tries to understand why he is adamant about involving himself in something that will most likely end with his own death. Raw shots, a constantly moving camera and point of view angles maintain a look and feel that at times seem almost entirely too real.<br /><br />  At the emotional conclusion, the movie leaves the audience with a sense of hope when, if only for a moment, the sound of a baby crying changes the behavior of not only a handful of people, but multitudes.<br /><br />  Overall, Children of Men is a fast paced story told by an innovative director (Alfonso Cuaron) that leaves the viewer wondering about the path of humanity and acknowledging the good and bad we are all capable of.und of a baby crying changes the behavior of not only a handful of people, but multitudes.

1416955070|4.0|I have to disagree with the reviews that state that this book is like any other teen book or movie. For me, I determine whether a book is decent or not by whether I can put it down when it's time to go to bed. At first, I admit, I could put it down. But half way through the book it picked up quite a bit and the next thing I knew it was 4:30AM. I read the other two sequels,also, and look forward to reading Simon's story.     It would seem logical then that Simon was one of my favorite characters, but I do have to say there was something to intriging Jace. I think the characters were fleshed out enough to establish their own identities and the story line was not specifically like anything else I have read unlike the Twilight wanna be's that have come out lately.

B000YIGNKE|3.0|I agree with many of the reviews that the last 10 minutes went horribly wrong.  That said, this was a very watchable version.    Make no mistake though- This does not hold a candle to the Amanda Root/Ciarin Hinds version.  I don't care if Root and Hinds had been twice the age that they were when they made their version- They were both far superior in their roles than Hawkins/Penry-Jones.  Cirian Hinds in particular wrapped up the definitive take on Captain Wentworth.    BTW, I'm assuming that all of the comments on what a hunk Penry-Jones is are coming from English viewers.  Penry-Jones is not by any means a bad looking fellow.  However, I think he could only be labelled a \\"hunk\\" by English standards for physical attractiveness.  Good looks or not, he simply did not have the \\"gravitas\\" of Hinds (IMO).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing the 30 day shred for the past 4 days and I must say this is hands down the best exercise dvd I have tried.  The first day on level 1 was a bit tougher than I was expecting and lets just say that the next morning getting out of bed was just as difficult.  I have never had such a quick and effective workout as this one.  With a two-year-old, a husband and being a full time student, a 20-minute workout is very doable. Thank goodness for a dvd that kicks your butt in under half an hour. Everyone has 20 minutes to spare!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|It's been awhile since a great score has been produced for a movie. The only complaint I have is that it sounds a little like the works James Horner has produced before, specifically Titanic and Braveheart.<br /><br />The beautiful use of a choral blends well with the tranquil string and French Horn solos. All the songs are great except for \\"Quaritch\\" and \\"Scorched Earth\\". These two songs are too bland. \\"Jake's First Flight\\" and \\"Iknimaya-The Path to Heaven\\" are great choral pieces and make your heart feel heavy with adventure. The \\"Bio-Illumniescense of the Night\\" and \\"Becoming one of the People\\" are very mysterious and have great string parts with a great blend of brass. Lastly, the song \\"I See You\\" will grow on you like you wouldn't believe, and Leona Lewis did a great job with it. I just wish she wouldn't use as much vibratto in her singing.<br /><br />Overall, a great album, and a must buy.
B001MW0J2O|3.0|Where's my freak-genius utterly-independent band that put out 2005's masterpiece Feels? Well, the influences abound in MPP. A lot of Beach Boys and The Mamas & The Papas, a smattering of Flaming Lips and XTC, and a dash of Lindsey Buckingham/Fleetwood Mac? This album will be re-evaluated in the future, and, unfortunately, downgraded some, though it still retains an unusual self-assuredness, especially at the 'coda.'

6305882592|5.0|This is a film about a young man running toward death and an old woman running toward life. They run into each other and a fine film results. The three main characters, Harold, Maud, and Harold's father, are exceptional and make the film highly entertaining through the tensions between Harold and Maud and Harold and his mother. Ruth Gordon is such a fine actress that she makes this film soar. Her approach to this eccentric character is warm and life affirming.  Bud Cort is superb as Harold, looking all of 17 years old throughout the film. Vivian Pickles is also superb as Harold's mother.  Maud is a mentor and muse for the somber Harold and through adventure after adventure he opens up to the life experiences around him. There is one scene which summarizes Maud's wisdom. When she is being taken into an emergency room on a stretcher, Harold says: \\"But Maud I love you.\\" To which Maud lovingly and serenely answers: \\"That is wonderful Harold, now go out and love some more.\\"  The simplicity and truth behind this short exchange struck me to the heart. The film is totally life affirming and the dark humor helps make it more so.     Because the film makes fun of the fashion of the times, the fact that it was made in 1971 does not date the film but rather seems more like a sly commentary on the hair, jewelry, clothes, and cars of that period. Cat Steven's soundtrack is joyful and a perfect compliment to the 1970 feel of the movie and its themes.     The film is now almost 40 years old and has become an American classic; primarily because the themes explored around the tensions, the push and pull, between our desire to live and our desire to give up are so perfectly portrayed in the film.
0783225881|5.0|How many men get to pursue their dreams? \\"Field of Dreams\\" is one man's quest to realize his one big moment. However, unlike most sports movies, the main character (Kevin Costner) isn't a star athlete, but rather a farmer who puts his faith in a mysterious voice from above. He goes around the country trying to figure out the connection between baseball and life - until he realizes it was all within himself. For sheer originality and creativity, the film is an easy 5-stars. The movie keeps you guessing and never fails to surprise. You certainly don't have to be a baseball fan to enjoy it - but you do have to accept that there are a bunch of baseball ghosts wandering around Iowa! Probably the best sports movie I've ever seen.
B00169N0BK|1.0|I bought the Colormunki to calibrate my Samsung monitor to my Epson Photo R1900 printer.  From what I read and from the Colormunki training DVD, this was supposed to be a simple, fool proof process for getting printed output to match what you see on the screen.  My experience says don't waste your money.  It has not worked.  You can get just as good results by using the custom profiles created by Epson for this printer. And X-rite's technical support is almost none existent!  They take days and sometimes weeks to respond and they're not very helpful when they do.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|While i dont think any terminator could be as good as the first 2.  This one comes pretty close.  You know how in the the 1st one it kept going to flashforwards to the future and how scary it was.  well in this movie youre in that enviroment the whole time.  Skulls all over the ground, people living underground, terminators lurking around every corner.  Its awesome bc i always loved those scenes in the first one.  the story is about a guy in jail who got the death penalty and hes signs to give his body over to science, but instead later in the future he wakes up to realize hes a terminator.  he meets up with john conners dad kyle reese, who is younger than he is, as they try to get away from the terminators.  Later kyle convinces the terminator guy (i forget his name at the moment) to meet up with john and they also meet up with a beautiful woman and they fall for each other.  when they finally meet up with john and he realizes the guy is a terminator he has trouble trusting him and locks him up.  but the woman rescues him and then to prove hes a good guy he tries to help find kyle reese who gets kidnapped by the bad termiators.  anyway you must see it if youre a fan of sci fi movies or the terminator movies, and who isnt right?

B002NXSRW0|4.0|wow i was never a big fan of gi joe.  i and did not expect the movie to look like this, but it was pretty good it has the guy from fighting who i love and marlon wayans very funny guy.  i thought he was gonna play a serious role in this movie, but i was wrong lol.  its a pretty good action movie with lots of fight scenes and a bunch of futuristic stuff pretty cool.  the only thing i didnt like about this movie was it was too long, i think like 2 hours, 2 hours is more than enough gi joe for me.  but i still give it four stars for all the cool action scenes and also a lot of funny scenes.  Like when marlon wayans goes through the train window lol.  i recommend it to anyone who likes g i joe or sci fi action movies
B0029358GM|2.0|I've enjoyed all of Wilco's recent albums, but this one is really quite bland, and their sound has lost its edge.  The melodies don't grab, and the lyrics that stand out seem cliched or repetitive of older themes.  They seem like genuinely good people, and I hope they can recapture their inspiration.

This movie is only loosely based on the GIJOE I remember, and if you are a hardcore old school fan like I am you will not like this. Transformers was at least true to its roots fun and entertaining. I wouldent waste the time or money on this movie. Bottom line DISSAPOINTING!
B001O7JHVG|1.0|If you enjoy watching UNREALISTIC situations   and scenarios on a visual screen, you are to   love this moronic film. Filled with all of the   most ridiculous examples that make it as stupid   as it is, in each and every scene, to the point   where it will FORCE able minds to intensely   search for anything sensible in it, only to   fail in that search, while they still bother to   watch.
0375707972|4.0|This novel packs a great deal of power into its scant 218 pages. The basis for the film that earned Kate Winslet her well-deserved Oscar, The Reader examines profound questions of love, morality, guilt, forgiveness, social justice, and the power of the past in beautifully written prose that I imagine is only more powerful and beautiful in the original German. The theme of literacy (and lack of it) is also quite prominent in the novel. Schlink manages to achieve an almost impossible task in The Reader, as he creates a sympathetic character out of a former Nazi--and that's only one of the many complications this novel depicts with such skill and artistry. He bravely tackles this problem, as well as the sexual relationship between the then 15 year-old narrator and the adult Hanna. I plan to pick up another one of his novels, Homecoming, in the hope that it's as good as The Reader.
B0015DYIH2|2.0|What began as an incredible story that elicited so much emotion was ended with what felt like a cheap ripoff written by a different person.  I agree with others who felt like it was all too neat.  Part of the appeal of this story was Bella's willingness to give up everything for her true love.  It ended cheaply with everything falling (too) perfectly into place.  The worst of it was the creepy imprinting on children...no matter what, that was just weird.  The whole BD book just felt forced and contrived.  So sad...what it could have been.
B001KEHAI0|5.0|You've gotta love a movie that features Bill Murray, a groundhog, and time travel. The concept behind this movie has since become famous and widespread. This is still the best.

B00HT2RTU6|5.0|&#34;The Sorcerer&#34; (1977) directed by William Friedkin is a remake of the French film from 1953 &#34;The Wages of Fear&#34;. The story relates the tale of four European's who are down on their luck that drive two trucks over treacherous mountain roads carrying nitroglycerine in order to extinguish a oil well explosion. This version differs from the original in several ways, including the beginning, which focuses on the lives of the four men before they came to South America. We learn what drove the men to seek refuge in this outpost of civilization that hugs the edges of a jungle. What follows from this initial sequence of introductions is some of the most harrowing action episodes, including the arduous journey through the jungle with the trucks trespassing over a swollen river by route of a rickety bridge during a tempest. I'm reminded of some of the extremes a director will go to in order to make a film, such as Werner Herzog in &#34;Aguirre, the Wrath of God&#34;, or in &#34;Fitzcarraldo&#34;, or in Francis Ford Coppola's &#34;Apocalypse Now&#34;. Friedkin had insisted that the film be filmed in the Domincan Republic, and this lends the film an authenticity, and heightened drama. The film gradually becomes ever more like a hallucination as this perilous heart of darkness journey takes Scanlon (Roy Scheider) to the edge of his wits. One of the most horrific and jarring scenes is that of the spent Scanlon stumbling like a zombie carrying the nitroglycerine. It is a frightening depiction of a man barely hanging on to life. The title comes from the name painted on one of the trucks.<br /><br />The film is notable for its electronic score by the German band Tangerine Dream. With this blu-ray release we finally get the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1, as opposed to the 1.33:1 ratio seen on the original dvd. One feels immersed within the jungle with the excellent HD Master Audio Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The film has been wonderfully remastered so all of the dirt seen on the original dvd is gone. Colours also seem much more vivid. This is an excellent upgrade for anyone who has had the dvd for all these years.l of the dirt seen on the original dvd is gone. Colours also seem much more vivid.

B001GV09FS|1.0|The last two songs in the movie (including Waterloo) are missing. It is misleading and dishonest to call this thing \\"a soundtrack.\\" The description of this CD as a \\"deluxe edition\\" is deciteful and intellectually insulting. No respectable vendor should carry this incomplete abomination. The one star is there because the Amazon system does not allow zero stars or negative numbers.
0575091088|4.0|As other reviews mention, the strength of this series is its characters.  I know you think you can't like an Inquisition torturer, but you will love Glokta.  (And how cool are Practicals?)  I relish Glockta's chapters, just like I do for Martin's Arya Stark.  Logen and his band of barbarians are also very likeable characters.  This book will make you chuckle a lot and even burst out laughing at some of the dialog.  It's action packed and the fight scenes are very well written.  That's a recipe for an extremely entertaining adult fantasy book.    I thought it was very weird that these books have no map of Abercrombie's world.  That's pretty unprecedented in fantasy and I have to say I missed not having it.  But other than that, it's hard to find any faults with this book.  It very hard for me to give a book 5 stars after George R. R. Martin, but this book gets extremely close.    Brent Week's Night Angel Trilogy is another fantasy series by a new-comer that's getting good reviews. I read and liked the NAT, but I'd have to say Abercrombie has him beat by a hair. I need to finish the series first (I'm partway through Book 2), but I'm hoping it ends up better.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|City of Bones is an amazing read. The characters are all very well developed. The story line is great, Clare really knows how to surprise you. From the first page I couldn't put down this book and the ending left me wanting more. All of the characters are exciting and have hilarious personalities. Jace's charming and witty sayings really had me laughing. It's companions, City of Ashes and City of Glass are just as good. By far my favorite series. I have recommended it to all my friends and the ones that read it loved it as well. I can't wait till the next book in the series is released. I also am looking forward to the prequel series, The Infernal Devices. In my opinion, these books put the Twilight Saga to shame.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'm going to be brief because I dont want to repeat what so many have said: This workout is amazing.  I long for the day that I can get to Level 3 where my wife is!  Hard to think that you can't even finish Level One in 20 min without feeling like you're going to die..but when its done you feel great!    I didn't give this a perfect score for only one simple reason:  Very frustrating DVD controls.. At least on my players (2 diff ones) you MUST listen to her intro and a few transition screens before getting into the workout...Its only for about 2 minutes but if you are anxious to get this workout done you have to wait EVERY TIME.  Reminds me of a Disney video....those of you who have them know what I mean!  Simply enabling the 'top menu' button to allow people to go right to workout 1,2 or 3 would earn this a perfect score.    Happy shredding!
B000803PKY|1.0|After listening to the CD I was furious.  It's not a studio recording...  it's a live recording.  As much as I enjoy Jackson Browne I felt cheated and decieved into purchasing a live recording. No where on the packaging does it indicate it's a live recording.  Frankly, I'd rather listen to nothing than listen to fans in the back-ground! I don't care how much I enjoy Jackson Browne's music... I'll be damn if I waste another dime on another of his CD's untill I can be damn sure it's a studio recording.<br /><br />I'm so angry I'm tempted to dig the pieces of the discs out of the trash and mail them back to Electra/Rhino along with an accompanying nasty-gram regarding deceptive marketing/packaging!<br /><br />As it is I personally feel a total refund is in order!
0811729117|3.0|This book really needed some editing. Just about the time I thought it was getting interesting the author went off on a tangent only to return far from where he left off, or not at all. That being said the accounts of action were well written and sometimes edgy. Although slow at times the reader will come away with knowledge about life in a tank that was not assumed, frosty walls, asphixiation fears and the fear of being stranded in no-mans land. Otto was one of those soldiers that deserves respect. He was the kind of leader who fought his superiors and subordinates alike, all for the right reasons. If you like this genre of history give it a try, for me it was more afterthought than I bargened for.
B001R10BM8|4.0|I've always like Never Say Never Again, though I acknowledge its flaws.  I liked that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and prefer that Bonds age was embraced rather than ignored.  I liked the way the movie poked fun at the conventions of a bond movie while using them, and frankly loved seeing connery as bond again. While I won't pretend it was the trendsetter of goldfinger or thunderball (of which it was based), I was far more entertained with it than You only live twice.  A very good movie.    With the blu ray I wanted to point out that it looks vastly superior to the original released dvd, yet doesn't shine the way modern Blu-ray movies do, not that it is expected.  I also rather enjoyed the special features, though wish sean connery himself was interviewed.  Overall, I can't imagine a better way to enjoy this movie, and if your a bond fan at all, it should be in your collection.  Recomended.
0307269981|3.0|I read this very quickly, because Salander is an engaging character. However -- as noted elsewhere -- the story sags when she's not there. And she can't be on-stage for much of it because she knows too many pieces of the puzzle; if she were more present, there would be little mystery, and in that sense this story creates a faux suspense. Another flaw in my eyes is that the central villain Zala and his relevance to Salander don't appear until the very end.
0694003611|5.0|Publisher's Summary<br />A little rabbit is lulled to sleep surrounded by all that he knows and loves best in the great green room of his house.<br /><br />*********************I don't think it's really complicated why this is popular. The story is not exactly mind-blowing or wonderfully heartfelt.  HOWEVER, this has a lot of repetition of a lot of big words for a baby and it's done in a way that (yes, it can be boring to some) when read prior to bedtime can set a tone for the evening. Now, it does not work for my son as far as making him ready for bedtime but then I also read it at any time of the day I want along with his other books in his library.<br /><br />What I think is unique about Goodnight Moon (as well as other familiar old classics) is that it takes some rather big words (no, it is not the \\"Cat in the Hat\\" but we love those type of stories also) and makes them into a story that can be read over and over and over and by the time you are most likely truly tired of it...and all, if you are reading it regularly enough. Your child may start to really get used to hearing the words and then one day...before you know it they can read some it.<br /><br />That is powerful, teaching your child to read. Now, you can try to teach your child with any book but Goodnight Moon isn't a decent effort for some children. It has some color and for newborns the black and white. I like the fact that this book is actually going to be easy for my child to read it himself when he hears it constantly.

0470477237|5.0|Qualman shares many fascinating examples of individuals, businesses and politicians using social media, while offering his own insightful viewpoint on the impact of social media on society today. Here are a few key points that Qualman makes as to why companies should not ignore social media:    --Consumers are powerful brand influencers. 78 percent of people trust their peers' opinions (Nielsen report). Also, 92 percent of consumers cite word-of-mouth as the best source for product and brand information.     --Marketers' jobs have changed from creating and pushing to one that requires listening, engaging, and reacting to potential and current customer needs. I think this shift symbolizes a tremendous opportunity for marketers to build loyalty and inspire future \\"brand ambassadors\\".    --It's better to make mistakes than not to take action.     I highly recommend reading this book, as Qualman provides many interesting examples of corporations that have succeeded with social media. His enthusiasm is infectious.    --Reviewed by Jessica Lewis, Master's Student ([..])
B002VPE1AM|3.0|.....but not this time.    I REALLY wanted to like this movie. I have been a huge James Cameron fan ever since 1984 with the release of the original \\"The Terminator\\".     Let's start with the obvious; the special effects. James Cameron boasted that the FX in this film are unlike anything ever seen before and they would revolutionize the FX industry. Well, I personally think he was absolutely right.    The effects are so amazing and totally engrossing. This movie had the ability to literally transport me to the world of Pandora. If future films can utilize FX to the same magnitude that Cameron has done so here, boy, are we in for some really great movies in the future. Truly ground-breaking.    The problem with Avatar is that the FX cannot carry the weight of all the hype that came along with this film. Although visually stunning, the true weakness of this film is the story. The story is rather predicatble and, truth be told, the plot is a LOT like \\"Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest\\" (yes - really!) and both films share MANY similarities.    The whole time I was watching the film, I felt like I was being preached to. Although the enviromentalist theme is pertinent to all societies of the world, when I go to the movies, I want to be entertained; not to be condescended to. I know that we should do our best to live in harmony with nature and protect our environment from over-exploitation, but I don't need the media shouting it in my face every time I turn around. Trees - good; greedy corporations - bad. I know it. I get it. Now just shut up and entertain me! I go to the movies to escape the problems of the world for awhile, not to be slapped in the face with them!    I found the acting to be a bit of a weak point as well. All of the actors do a passable job, I guess, but for some reason, I felt like Sigourney Weaver was performing her role as if she were in on some kind of joke. Weaver is an amazing actress, but I just felt like she was going through the motions with Avatar; like she didn't want to be there.    Avatar is an amazing FX film, but overall, it's only an OK film. If only the story would have matched the scope of the visual effects, then maybe Cameron could have indeed securd his title as \\"King of the World\\" (LOL!).

Sofia Coppola    The best thing that happened in The Godfather Trilogy?  Sofia Coppola dies in the end! Thank God!    The worst and most disgusting actor or actress in The Godfather Trilogy? Sofia Coppola    My God, Sofia Coppola, what a terrible and disgusting actress.  ZERO acting ability and gross looking. BLAH!!!    Not many people know this but, Sofia Coppola was cast in The Godfather Part I as a little boy.  It is ironic because I thought she looked like a person who had a sex change in The Godfather Part III. Man what an ugly duckling. :-)    What a shame The Godfather Part III had such a poor looking non-talented beast of an actress shoved into it.  Again, what... a... shame...
B000002GB9|5.0|Unlike Journey and Foreigner, two bands manufactured from a repository of hired guns, STYX started life as a genuine band during their scholastic years. Granted, their public and personal demeanor was built around their professional (mostly financial) success, however most of their best works were the creations of a true band.     For better or worse, the intellectualism of the individual band members (even high school graduate Tommy Shaw) outshined the \\"go for broke\\" rebelliousness (such as lacivious drunken orgies, shooting guns at televisions or throwing furniture out of hotel room windows) that was favored by Rolling Stone magazine and others.    STYX wrote intelligent and mystical songs that soothed the unyielding insecurities and unmet self-efficacies of youth. From the unquestioned mastery of their musical instruments, their remarkable (sometimes overwrought) vocals, on to their ethereal lyrics and arrangements, STYX created a sound of talent and awe unmatched yet today. Additionally, their prowess as a live touring act also held them above most bands of their hey day and modern day.    THE GRAND ILLUSION has long been regarded as their finest vinyl release (although I actually favor PIECES OF EIGHT and CYCLORAMA), and with the collection of songs within, it is hard to argue that 10 million people could be wrong.     Along the lines of the ethereal and mystical are the Dennis DeYoung penned tunes COME SAIL AWAY and CASTLE WALLS. COME SAIL AWAY is lauded as one of the most enduring of songs from the bands 4 decades worth of recordings. With its soaring vocals and keyboards, to its hard driving chorus on through to the trade off of lead guitars, the song catapulted a moderately successful band into a six-year long overnight success.     MISS AMERICA (James Young) and FOOLING YOURSELF (Tommy Shaw) are follow up hits that showcased the diversity of sounds and styles that made the album greater than the sum of its parts. Dennis was often the pomposity that meldedtheatrics with rock and roll, while James (J.Y.) Young was the hard charging metal rocker, fused together by the eclectic styles of southern rocker Tommy Shaw (whose influences ranged from Hank Williams Sr., Johnny Cash and Patsy Cline on through Otis Redding, B.B. King and Bill Withers, on to the BEATLES, CROSBY-STILLS-NASH, and even REO SPEEDWAGON).     For my money, MAN IN THE WILDERNESS is the truly amazing song of the album. The song was written with heart-wrenching lyrics of the psychological emptiness of being a bought and paid for entertainer who stands before \\"ten thousand people look my way/ but they can't see the way that I feel/ nobody even cares to try. I spend my life and sell my soul on the road/ and I'm still in the dark 'cause I/ can't seem to find the light alone.\\" The vocals are almost breath-taking as one can almost hear the tears of a lonely soul. The virtuoso guitar work is that of a musician who prefers solos that are within the structure and breath of the song, rather than as staples of showmanship where in speed and technical merit falls far from the rhythm of the song.     This song beckons the listener to feel the emotions and follow the confusions of the artist, not unlike a great piece of literature. Such as it is, the very definition of art, rather than the self-indulgence of a 'corporate/ faceless band.'    STYX was then and remains now, a thinking mans rock band. Filled with the emotions and turmoils of modern life, rather than the vile audacity of promoting the debauchery of rock and roll life (even as the band members were living in it.) STYX is a band that realized then and still \\"carries on\\" today that music can achieve something greater than a nice beat to dance to. STYX realized that music can change peoples lives and help make this a better world.    THE GRAND ILLUSION was the first of four consecutive triple platinum albums and continues to be the biggest selling album of the band (and not without reason.)     I recommend thisalbum without reservation. If you love truly grand music (as opposed to the \\"sex, drugs and rebellion\\" that so many ignorant fools sought to promote) you will love THE GRAND ILLUSION... \\"cause deep inside we're all the same.\\"
B000MTPANQ|5.0|After 40 years of enjoying Neil Young, I bought Live at Massey Hall.  The music conveys emotion, the songs are easy to get lost in and  the recording quality is excellent. I've heard most before but not like this.  It is my new favorite.

0446619078|4.0|I've read most of the Harry Bosch novels by now, but I had never gotten around to number four in the series. Shame, too, since the subject of this novel is deeply personal territory for Connelly's tortured detective: Bosch, as usual in deep trouble for his attitude and behavior, is pulled into an unofficial cold case-- the death of his own mother, many years before.<br /><br />I still like the first two books in the series better-- I was really blown away by [[ASIN:0446612731 The Black Echo]] when I first read it. Still, this is a very good book, and pretty essential reading if you're interested in the character and his background.<br /><br />I wouldn't suggest you begin with The Last Coyote. Start with the earlier books so that you build up a little bit of an impression of the character. The back story is much more meaningful if you know our Harry a little bit better.

0061478784|5.0|To be honest, when I heard there was a book that Miyazaki's film was based on, I was surprised.  I thought the book itself would be no where near as good as the movie.  After reading it, I really have to say that the book surpasses the movie by a long shot.  It is written extremely well, it is easy to keep up with and really holds your attention.  The characters are a bit different in the book compared to the movie, and you also get so much to each of the characters.<br /><br />If you loved or even liked the Miyazaki production, I would highly recommend reading this book!  If you haven't watched the movie but would like to, I'd suggest watching the movie first.  Even if you read it first, the story lines are relatively different, as well as some of the characters, so you'll be surprised to see how they are different, especially if you watched the movie first. :)

B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna miraculously ascended to the throne as Queen Of Pop with her very first album and shocked the world.  It's hard to imagine now but in 1983 many people thought that only people from certain groups, such as blacks or white Anglo-Saxon Protestants for example, were qualified to be Queen Of Pop. Yet a nervous world was witnessing its first Catholic Queen Of Pop, Madonna. There were many people who believed that a Catholic was unfit to serve as Queen Of Pop. That all Catholics were enthralled to their puppet master in Rome, The Pope. That they were intellectually ill-equipped for anything more than brutish manual labor and the hollow recreation of excessive devotion to the superstitious hocus-pocus of their beloved mother church. Italian-American Catholics in particular were regarded as drunks and loud pasta eaters who, given half the chance, would sooner spend their last dime on a pint of red wine from 7-11 than buy food for their drooling simpleton relatives and their innumerable brood of squalling infants -- each one an unwelcome addition to the Pope's legion of brainless drones. That was then. As Madonna released each brilliant single and video from her debut album, she proved that Catholics were not only acceptable but could lead us into new frontiers with energy, faith, devotion.  Now, in 2010, only Arabs are held in the sort of contempt once reserved for Catholics. It may still be many years before the world has its first Arab Queen Of Pop but I hope I am alive to see that day. As it turned out, Madonna was the perfect Queen for the times, and her debut stands as the best single-artist disco album ever.  With this self-titled record, Madonna imbued her mission with a single-minded devotion to melding hot beats with the loftiest of ideals for the liberation of the world. Her heroic example and irreproachable standards still inspire us today.

Don't pixel peep at the movie color quality like some reviewers do, but look at the story being told.  \\"District 9\\" depicts human greed and selfishness at its worst, and what better individuals to show it than white south africans and those twisty nigerians. The MNU seems to be the equivalent of current UN organisation that we have.  The very same thing is happening to our wildlife and forests, the parallels are there.

0786838655|4.0|I'm just a little on the fence about this book.  To be frank, I found Riordan's style a little bit pedestrian at times.  He doesn't have the gift with words that some other authors of children's works have.  I also thought that it was oh-so-slightly derivative.  Percy Jackson has his mom's black hair and green eyes?  Really?  I'm just glad he didn't have a trident-shaped scar on his forehead, or wear taped-up glasses.  Still, this is a very fun book, and anything that can spark a kid's interest in subjects like Greek mythology is A-OK in my book.    The book really worked for me when it showcased Riordan's snarky sense of humor and his love of the absurd.  I found the names he gave to things particularly witty.  I also really enjoyed the chapter titles, and some of them even made me laugh out loud.  I like a good, intense book as much as anyone, but I really admire those that also incorporate some elements of humor, and Riordan's novel certainly does that here.  The way Percy thumbs his nose at authority figures is entertaining (particularly the \\"gift\\" he ships off to Olympus shortly after his foray into a gnome emporium), and will certainly resonant with some kids--and even adults.  Who doesn't wish they could tell their superiors off and get away with it?    The one downer of this book was that I saw one of the elements of the prophecy coming from a mile away, and I'm sure I'm not alone in that.  It's a very fine line to walk, giving just enough detail to keep the reader guessing, but not enough that you give it all away.  Unfortunately, Riordan gave too much away for me in this particular instance.    What works well about the book is that, even though our young hero is blessed with some pretty great powers, he is also still fallible.  I was a little afraid that each time he came upon an epic battle, he would somehow manage to prove himself master of the universe, even though he had just come into his power.  However, I felt Riordan did a nice job of handling these encounters, particularly one that takes place on top of the St. Louis Arch.    And on that note, what American can resist the idea of the Greek mythological world intersecting with our own?  I was highly entertained by the idea of the gods romping around Olympus, only a few hundred feet above the heads of New York tourists.  I also loved Percy's pen, and the remarkable powers of Annabeth's baseball cap.  This is a highly imaginative work that does a great job of weaving the real world with a fantastic vision of the mythological world.

0380730367|3.0|This is my first Lehane novel, although I've seen both the films Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone and thought both were well done.  I blazed through this novel in only a day or so, which means it at least kept my interest going however the overall experience was less than satisfying.  The authentic-sounding snappy dialog present in Gone Baby Gone seems to have been replaced in this book by superficial comments and inane chatter.  The entire plot, which I thought started off ok, eventually deteriorates into a mishmash of violence and unconvincing twists and characters. The reuniting of the two detectives, both professionally and romantically, was utterly underwhelming and not very believable to me.  However, I have already bought another Kenzie/Gennaro Lehane book to see if my dislike for this one was just a fluke so I liked what I read enough to give the series another try.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up is a film that is buoyed by fantasy but anchored in deep human emotion. Carl is a recent widower who decides to set his house afloat and take it and himself to Paradise Falls, somewhere in South America. Chance has young Boy Scout Russel on the house with him, and when close to their destination both decide to work together to get the house right where it needs to be. In comes Kevin, a massive ostrich/peacockesque creature, along with well-meaning pup Dug, and together the foursome work to beat the evil Charles Muntz who is bent on using Kevin to further his fame.     But that's just the plot. Up succeeds so well because of its storytelling power, and how well it balances its light and dark moments. The film moves from its deeply sad prologue to scene after scene incredible imagination. The visuals can't be beat; a house suspended by balloons drifting through the clouds, a chase over a canyon, the characters climbing the walls of a zeppelin. The pacing is also noteworthy- the film never drags and consistently has a new and original turning point to keep it exciting. The film also does an excellent job in dealing with adult love and loss in a manner that is both abrupt and warm, and wouldn't detract its younger viewers from enjoying the film's lighter parts. Very funny and moving, Up is as good as anything Pixar has ever released.

0812550706|2.0|Winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards? Really? This is a book with only marginally decent prose, unlikeable characters and a weak plot and it has been deemed equal to masterpieces written by authors such as Asimov, Dick, Gibson and Le Guin?    Sorry to all the fans, because I know there are many who love this series, but this book is not worth the hype. There is nothing worse in terms of characterization than surrounding your protagonist with villains who have no reason to be mean in order to make us sympathize with the victim. It is also mind-boggling to see something as ridiculous as eugenics employed in sci-fi, of all genres, to justify the presence of not one, but three genius children in one family. World domination via message boards? Seriously? The worst part of it all is that Ender is meant to be a long-suffering, courageous hero, according to Card. That is not the book I read.     My advice: read this as the 'making of' of a serial killer and you might enjoy it.

0385504225|2.0|If this author can become a best seller by putting out this dribble, there is hope for all Creative Writing students.    It really doesn't matter what my opinion is, because the book is the number one best seller. It just goes to show you that you shouldn't be influenced by the spot on the best seller list as you search for the next book to purchase.    The author is a master at accumulating more trivia than you could ever hope to digest and creating a story line around as an accompaniment.    The plot has more holes than Swiss cheese and the book runs much too long. Maybe the publisher pays by the pound. It's a shame though to cut down more trees as a result of Mr. Brown's prattling on.    Oh well, you've been warned. The rest is up to you. Remember though, if you encourage him by buying the book, more innocent trees will be unnecessarily sacrificed..

B000UBMWG4|5.0|Overall excellent package, but be aware that the disc containing the excellent making of documentary is not on Blu-Ray but on a DVD. Whilst the Blu-Ray's are region free, the DVD is not, and I had trouble playing the DVD over here in Australia (region 4). Really I think this is rather poor, as the package is advertised as Blu-Ray, and the \\"5-Disc Collectors Edition\\" statement would be expected to mean 5 Blu-Ray discs, not 4 Blu-Rays and 1 DVD. I do not care that the content, the making of documentary, is in standard def, but see no reason why it still could not and should not have been put on a Blu-Ray disc. The main reason I bought it was for the making of doco, and I nearly was unable to view it.

B002XUL85G|5.0|le samourei, i've gotta say that u know absolutely know nothing about acting or film in general if u thought these two actors came off as caricatures ..... i mean nothing could be further from the truth, honestly.i'm almost thinking you seriously don't know what a caricature is, because the performances were exactly the opposite of that word.  the actors were wonderful in their portrayals , both of them, not one was better than the other. first, they both captured exactly the way people act when they are being taped by family and friends.i mean it's almost a little bit of a performance at first when you're taped , and they nailed it. secondly, when they were in more intimate situations during the film, like when the camera was stationary for a length of time, they were completely natural and believable. the word caricature shouldn't even be in the same sentence when describing this film. it was also an amazing movie in general. the performances, directing, script, editing, were all fabulous, imo. it was one of the best horror films i've seen in awhile, and it takes a lot to get me to say that...i'm very judgemental of movies, and just in general actually. the last one i saw that scared me the same way this one did was, \\"the exorcism of emily rose\\"....another great horror flick. there are a couple of others that i'd recommend as well like, \\"the strangers\\", and the remake of \\"when a stranger calls\\".<br /><br />this film though, was unbelievably terrifying, without doing much. you never see what is terrifying them. it makes your imagination wander into horrifying realms , and that's what is truly scary. i also disagree with the person who said the alternate ending wasn't up to par. when i saw it i couldn't decide which ending i liked better, which is so rare with these types of films. if i was directing this film i would have had a tough time deciding which one to use. they were both just as fantastic in completely different ways....as u can probably tell  i recommend this movie wholeheartedly...see it , it's definitely worth your time.movie wholeheartedly...see it , it's definitely worth your time.

0156027321|5.0|There is a good reason why \\"Life of Pi\\" is such a highly recommended and positively reviewed book - it lives up to what it promises.  Yann Martel has crafted an incredulous yet believable tale of survival populated with the unlikeliest of characters.  It is a story that will have readers questioning their deepest held beliefs, entering into the debate about the life of animals in zoos, and trying to understand the role that stories play in our lives and our understanding of the world.<br /><br />The story begins in both Pondicherry, India, and Toronto, Canada; Pi recounts his life growing up as a zookeeper's son as the narrator offers insight into his later years.  Pi finds himself in Canada because that is where his family intended to immigrate to, but four days out at sea, their boat is sunk during a storm.  Pi is the only human survivor, but he finds his lifeboat \\"peopled\\" with a wounded zebra, a hyena, an orangutan, and a Bengal tiger.  Within a short period of time, it is down to Pi and the tiger, Richard Parker.  How can a sixteen-year-old boy possibly survive on the Pacific Ocean with a wild animal?  Yet Pi not only survives (by claiming his territory onboard and training Richard Parker), he thrives under his ordeal, strengthened by his various faiths (Hinduism, Christianity and Islam) and his resolve to make sure both he and the tiger survive.<br /><br />From the very beginning, readers know that this story will have a \\"happy ending\\" since Pi obviously survived to tell his tale.  Yet Martel creates enough gripping excitement and suspense to keep readers reading.  The storytelling is sometimes purposely stilted, as if being told through Pi's diary entries, while other chapters can have an encyclopedic quality to them when Pi defends zoos or describes animals.  Pi's story is incredible and hard to believe, but readers will willingly suspend disbelief for this miraculous tale.  Martel offers readers an alternative reality (in more ways than one) which will have them happily considering what can be defined as truth.considering what can be defined as truth.

B0031R5K68|4.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's books. Although the quality of his writing is average at best, he does create page-turners with a huge amount of research supporting most his novels. The Lost Symbol is no different, blending mysticism, science and art in a tight thriller. I have enjoyed despite extravagant twists and poor dialogues.

0385341008|5.0|Curl up in your favorite reading spot, make sure you have a beverage and something to snack on and allow yourself the time to read and enjoy this book.  It is a book that is meant to be savored.  Don't hurry.  Please, take your time as you will enjoy the journey and the wonderful friends you meet along the way. This novel is full of vibrant, plucky characters that are so real that you'll wish you could invite them to your next book club meeting.<br /><br />This book begins in January, 1946 with disheartened author, Juliet Ashton.  She is unhappy because she has been writing \\"fluff\\" opinion pieces for her good friend and publisher, Sidney Stark.  Juliet longs to write something more serious, but she cannot figure out what that might be. Meanwhile, Juliet begins corresponding with a man by the name of Dawsey Adams.  He writes to her because he found her name and address in a book of hers that he found and loves and credits for helping him get through the war.<br /><br />The Society that is referred to in the title (which I love) is really a book club,  invented as a ruse to keep the German's from arresting people who were out after curfew.  This book reveals much about the aftermath of WWII, people's memories and their desire to move forward. The story is unforgetable.  The fact that it was written in the form of letters back and forth between the different characters is very unique; I did not find it distracting at all.  I loved this book right from the beginning because it speaks of books, bookshops, and the fact that books bring people together.<br /><br />This book easily makes my top ten list already for this year.  Hopefully, author Annie Barrows will pick up where her aunt left off and continue to write with the same care and keen eye.

B0001Z37HM|4.0|After her family is murdered a young woman named Red Sonja becomes a master of the sword and seeks revenge on the evil queen responsible for the mayhem that has befallen her. Also, it seems the queen has stolen a powerful, carefully guarded, glowing orb right before it was meant to be destroyed, one that has powers of its' own, allowing for the possessor to control elemental forces and call down storms and earthquakes, if they so wish. Kalidor, one of the individuals in place to oversee the destruction of the orb, joins forces with Red Sonja, as their paths may differ, but they ultimately lead to the same place. An impudent, young prince named Tarn and his guard/manservant Falkon, whose kingdom was unceremoniously wiped out by Gerden as a test for her newfound powers, soon joins them.

B000NJVWUA|4.0|As the Alan Parsons Project continued their glide from prog-rock to prog-pop, \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" maintained the quality of the previous [[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]]. Stellar musicianship, exquisite production values, and top-notch songwriting. This also may be the album where the first cracks in the Parsons/Woolfson alliance can be seen forming.<br /><br />The late Eric Woolfson was still the conceptual leader in the APP, but he was also aspiring to the stage. \\"Ammonia Avenue's\\" pop conventions were now more prominent than the rock ones, with the Phil Spector wall-of-sound homage of \\"Don't Answer Me\\" being the most obvious. (I was also surprised to learn the these songs were originally being considered as a double album, with the remainders eventually arriving on [[ASIN:B000JLQSWE Vulture Culture]]. Parsons still delivered his sonic expertise, with his signature sound permeating \\"You Don't Believe\\" and the instrumental \\"Pipeline.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Ammonia Avenue\\" reaches a balance between the two men, yet it was the first time an APP album felt like it was being divided between its two creative forces. Parsons and Woolfson would soldier on for two more albums, but this was the junction that the two men began taking their separate highways.

0307454541|3.0|I do not feel it necessary to re-write the entire plot of this book, however, I will say how incredibly dissapointed I was while reading it. So many people raved about this book. \\"Suspenseful\\" and \\"thriller\\" do not belong in the same sentence as this title! It took me 2 solids WEEKS to read this book, because I was simply not interested and had to force myself to read it. I almost quit a few times, but I can't do that once I start reading something. I will say, that at around page 200, I started not hating it. At about page 350'ish, I may have even enjoyed it some, but my gosh, it's not worth the time suck just for a good 75 page, give or take, good read.<br /><br />I found this incredibly slow moving, and really not interesting for the most part.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've seen A LOT of television over the years, and while I can say that this isn't the all-time greatest series ever, it has become one of the most fun, easy to watch shows I've ever laid eyes on. There is a certain charm to it, yet a distinctly adult, dark and sexy tone that's there. The characters are quirky and even likable and the music is bluesy, mysterious and totally appropriate. I have not read the books, so I was introduced to Sookie's world for the first time when this premiered on HBO, but I was drawn right into the show and I wanted--I NEEDED to see more. It's like TV crack...or 'V' rather :)    There is a decent amount of nudity and gore, which you probably know, hence the HBO label, but it's fun and never too much...stay away if you aren't into explicit stuff.       The main point: this show is a thrill to watch. Buy it if you want an amazing TV experience. Not world-changing or mind-opening, but from the 1st episode to the shocking season finale, True Blood is a consistently entertaining, over-the-top, and memorable show.    A+

B00275EGWY|5.0|THE HURT LOCKER is not an easy film to watch, especially for veterans.  It may be about the Iraq War circa 2004, but it is essentially about WAR in general and the devastation created by this most foolish of human games not only on the countrymen of the site of the killing but also on the soldiers from all countries who bond to fight the 'enemy': as Pogo said in a long ago war 'We have met the enemy and he is us'.  Kathryn Bigelow has accomplished the unthinkable - she has created a small, tense, breathless re-enactment of a group of men (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) whose sense of mission and sense of family and disillusion are as fragile as the homemade human and other bombs they render safe. In a minimal but terse script by Mark Boal the words are less important than the expressions on the actors faces, and with a cast as fine as this, those statements are more powerful  than words.<br /><br />The scene is Baghdad in 2004 and we watch as an EOD specialist Thompson (Guy Pierce), a man for whom the group - namely Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) - has profound respect and love, is blown up in the first minutes of the film.  Thompson is replaced by an obsessed EOD specialist with a record of over 800 bombs rendered safe, one William James (Jeremy Renner) who keeps his mementos of wasted bombs in his 'hurt locker' under his bed.  The film deals with the gradual adjustment of the men to this new, obsessed EOD man as the group faces horrendous encounters with the Iraqis, both adults and children.  There are surprise cameos by David Morse and by Ralph Fiennes, but they don't last long as characters.  What lasts is the interdependency among the men locked into a mission more terrifying than can be imagined.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner delivers a finely nuanced performance of a man whose adrenaline rush with his job makes him a unique sort of being, yet a man who is capable of the most tender of responses.  Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are also superb in roles that in other actors' hands may have become trite.  This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe.  Kathryn Bigelow deserves the Oscar for bringing this stunning event to the screen.  Grady Harp, January 10t in other actors' hands may have become trite.  This is an important film for all of us to see - especially now, as war escalates over the globe.

B002VECM4A|3.0|Start with the title of this highly touted film PRECIOUS: BASED ON THE NOVEL \\"PUSH\\" BY SAPPHIRE. That seems a bit presumptuous. Then note that the film's Executive Producers are Oprah Winfrey and Tyler Perry, and that the film includes Mariah Carey in the cast and the piece seems to have been directed toward notice by the Academy people. For this viewer this is a nice little story that is a very touching examination of the life of a girl with all odds against her who survives it all. Lee Daniels directs an interesting cast who bring off Geoffrey Fletcher's screenplay with all of its street talk very well. But is the overall effect worth all the hoopla?<br /><br />Precious (Gabourey Sidibe) is an obese, abused, illiterate 16 year old who has no friends and no support and is pregnant with her second child, the result of rape by her father. She lives with her worthless fat abusive mother Mary (Mo'Nique in a truly brilliant performance) and the two dwell in a hovel as dark as Precious' future: Precious' only salvation is in her dreams of being a glamorous singing and movie star and these sequences are well choreographed. There is a break through for Precious when she is placed in an Alternative School under the warmth and caring pedagogy by Blue Rain (Paula Patton) and she begins her journey to literacy and finding some sense of dignity. Along the way she is assisted by social worker Mrs. Weiss (Mariah Carey) and a day care worker played by the novel's author, Sapphire. Precious is surrounded by a classroom of interesting struggling teens - all well portrayed.<br /><br />The standout performance in this film and the actress deserving of recognition is Mo'Nique. Gabourey Sidebe physically fills her part but she is given very little (except for a major final scene) to display talent. See the film out of curiosity and for the message it delivers.

B002VPE1B6|4.0|I saw this movie on opening night and nobody gave an applause at the end of the movie except for the mentally challenged girl who was clapping throughout the entire film.  I agree whole heartedly with them, the movie was too long and the movie was extremely corny and over emphasized to be a tree huger and be kind to any forms of life we find.  Those are good morals and all but it was like the entire picture, 2 hours and thirty minutes of being spoon fed the idea of having respect for everyone and respecting our planet. The thing that I hated most about Avatar is that it basically took everything from the lore of Warcraft and made a movie out of it.  The blue aliens are the Warcraft night elves, their forest cannot survive without the huge tree exactly like in the movie.  The healing things floating around represent the wisps in Warcraft. If the movie was shorter and wasn't half stolen from Warcraft I would've probably thought this was one of the better movies of the decade but It's so much like Warcraft that it seemed like a cheap ripoff.  I cannot understand why such a simple minded film had to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, oh wait they wanted to make sure the movie costed an epic amount of money so the movie had to be long...  I like the morals, action scenes, picture quality and the sci-fi elements in this movie so I will rate this 4 stars as if the movie wasn't made to long, otherwise it is a 3 to me.
0670021652|5.0|I found Committed to be part memoir (a continuation of her love story with Felipe), part marriage manifesto, part feminist pronouncement and part self-help marriage manual. I loved every part of it. Gilbert's writing is clear and funny and convincing. It was what drew so many people to Eat, Pray, Love.    This really is a book for women, and it is a book about marriage through the ages and what marriage can mean for women. One part that took my breath away was her recounting of her Grandmother Maud's story. Equally as impressive was her own mother's story, and I got a little teary eyed at the end when she finally reunions with her lover after some weeks a part. As someone who endeavors to write myself, I feel like Gilbert makes the act of writing seem so easy and so profound.    Make no mistake, this is a very different story than the book that brought her so much attention, but the writing and the ideas and even the story are as captivating and worth your time as ever.

This thing did the trick and was very cheap. It supplies just enough power to increase the volume by an extra 10-15% and produce a \\"fuller\\" sound. The rechargeable battery is a big plus and the amplifier seems to be built pretty well. I have tried using the bass boost switch, but it just doesn't sound right with it on. On most songs there is a noticeable low-midrange frequency that sounds real 'boomy' and makes the music sound sloppy. This is really a great buy for the price, if you are trying to get a little more ooomph or volume from your headphones or laptop speakers.
B001TODCII|4.0|Liam Nesson plays as Bryan Mills, a father of a daughter who is kidnapped. Same old, same old, right? Wrong. This is an action-packed adventure that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire film. Its fight scenes are amazingly chorographed, and the pace of the film is so fast, that you don't even pay attention to the plot, you just watch Mills do his thing. The guy will stop at nothing to find his daughter, and that's when the fun begins. I will say though, the movie does have a heart. Mills, previous to his daughter's kidnapping, retired to spend time with his daughter. He's divorced and is overshadowed by the stepfather and the mother. He's not a perfect guy, but he's a perfect action hero.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|At my school, Napoleon Dynamite is considered a classic, but to me, it is a waste of time. It stars Jon Heder, as Napoleon, the main character. He's a weird character, and for some reason people find him and his jokes funny. Here's the level of humor we're dealing with here: \\"You're a fat lard.\\" (You're supposed to laugh at that.) And, get this, Napoelon plays dodgeball with himself. Again, this isn't funny, it just kinda weird. If you laughed at the above jokes, you'll like this movie; but if you didn't, like me, this will be a complete waste of your time.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|There is something about the pairing of an over-the-top Diane Keaton and an arrogant and sarcastic Jack Nicholson that just gets me every time.  It doesn't matter that Keaton's antics can be completely unrealistic, or that Nicholson's `all too familiar' character development can verge on lazy; all that matters is that together they are undeniably entertaining.  You can't help but get sucked into their chemistry, which just oozes onto every frame of this film.<br /><br />`Something's Gotta Give' is one of those films that shouldn't work, and when dissected it really doesn't work, but manages of actually WORK thanks to a combination of smart dialog, funny performances and total chemistry.<br /><br />Erica Barry is a playwright past her bloom who has fooled herself into thinking that she is happy being alone.  Her daughter, Marin, is dating Harry Sanborn, a music producer who is so full of himself he comes across more pathetic than confident.  Harry is the same age (or at least closer in age) as Erica.  When a series of events forces Harry under the care of Erica, love starts to bloom in an unexpected area.  Soon Harry and Erica are finding that they enjoy one another and soon they are giving themselves to each other in ways they never imagined possible; but, is this relationship really meant to work?<br /><br />Nancy Meyers script starts off wonderfully, but it does start to drag in the third act; getting a little tiresome.  I have found this to be a problem with Meyers work.  She understands how to create something fresh and exciting in this genre (romantic comedy) that is so tired and clich&eacute;d, but she doesn't know how to edit very well.  I actually liked the plot twist with the younger doctor falling for Erica, and I actually felt that the usually stiff and monotonous Reeves nailed his performance, but it does drag on for too long and starts to verge on unnecessary, which is sad since the plot point in its initial stages feels very nicely crafted.  In fact, my only real complaints with this film fall in the scripts final stages.<br /><br />Everything else seems to blend together beautifully.<br /><br />Even though this film is riddles with quirks and flaws and moments that just feel SO WRONG, they work so well with one another.  That's why I said that this is a film that works even though it technically shouldn't.  Keaton and Nicholson thrive off one another and really give the audience their moneys worth.  I wish that Nicholson didn't have to constantly fall back on this variation of his persona, but at least he does it well (unlike actors like Pacino who have played variations of themselves for years yet fail to be anything more than an annoying caricature).<br /><br />This film is fun, and I applaud it for embracing an age bracket that is often dismissed in films, especially of this nature (how many senior romantic comedies are out there people?).this film fall in the scripts final stages.

0525421033|2.0|I've been wanting to read this book for ages.  So when I finally got my hands on it and read it...  Well, let's just say that this was a very disappointing book for me.<br /><br />Instead of an interesting story about a girl trying to decide whether or not to stay living, we have a story based around a whole bunch of boring flashbacks that do little to move the story forward or develop the characters who matter.  Seriously... my favourite characters are probably the main character's parents' friends.  Why do I feel like I know them better than I know the main character?<br /><br />The near-death experience was completely underutilized.  Mia can do nothing she wouldn't be able to do as a human.  She can't walk through walls, can't flit off to Hawaii, can't even visit her brother at another hospital.  So what's the point?<br /><br />I've read a few dead-narrator books, and this is the dullest one so far.  For a much better read with characters you can actually care about, try Alice Sebold's [[ASIN:0316001821 The Lovely Bones: Deluxe Edition]].
B000GG4Y32|5.0|One of my all time favorite films to broach one of my all time favorite subjects; `Reds' is an outstanding example of filmmaking at its absolute finest (in every possible way).  It's hard for me to really put into words what I think about this film, because it is such an experience in itself that mere words don't seem to do the film justice.<br /><br />I've heard so many complain that this film is boring and overly long and I'm stumped because I don't think a single film has really ever engulfed me like `Reds'.  That isn't to say that this is the best movie out there (in fact, it isn't even the best movie of '81; that honor goes to `Diva'), but Beatty's direction is truly one of the best directorial achievements of all time.  His delicate yet swift hand helped create a lavish and exciting epic feel without losing the intimacy and personal taste level needed to give this type of story `flesh'.<br /><br />This movie was such a joy to watch.<br /><br />The film centers on American Communist John Reed, and it tells his story; from his involvement in the Russian Revolution to his intimate relationship with Louise Bryant, a writer who sparks his interest and tests his values.  Their relationship (as chaotic and conflicted as it was) is the true heart of this film; and while `Reds' is a political masterpiece (it is one of those rare films that really makes you feel a part of the history, delivering a powerful and intelligent story without losing the audience in the unfolding) it is first and foremost a beautiful love story that captures the heart of man.  Reed's loyalties are tested by Bryant, but their love is never in question.<br /><br />Don't get anxious, for this is not your typical weepy romantic film.  What I mean by love story is that is really fleshes out the human NEED to love.<br /><br />Garnering a slew of Oscar nominations, and even netting Beatty that coveted directing Oscar, `Reds' is certainly outstanding in every area.  Warren Beatty is not an actor I am really head-over-heals for.  I often find him either stiff (he was the worst part of the otherwise superb `Bonnie and Clyde') or forgettable (again, he was the worst part of the otherwise enjoyable `Shampoo') but he has impressed me a few times (his ferocious approach in `Bugsy' was startling and breathtaking at the same time) and this is one of them.  Sure, he is not best in show, but he really understands the political and emotional makeup of this character.  I think maybe his directing had a hand in his grasp of character, but he really sunk into this one.  Personally, this film belongs to Diane Keaton.  I just LOVE this performance; so strong and full of fervor and tenacity.  She develops a fully fleshed out woman who longs to get a hold on all she holds dear but is unable to fully comprehend how to do that.  So many rave Keaton's `Annie Hall', but honestly, her Louise Bryant is MUCH better.<br /><br />Aside from those two beautiful performances, there is Oscar nominated (and deserving of those nominations) Jack Nicholson and Maureen Stapleton (Stapleton actually won the Oscar).  I adore Stapleton in this film.  I was thinking the other day about supporting performances that truly define the category, and this performance kept popping up in my head.  She really delivers such an authentic and natural progression of character; never delving into ticks or gimmicks or clich&eacute;s to build her character, but hinging her entire performance on pure and genuine humanity.<br /><br />Just breathtaking.<br /><br />I'd feel bad if I didn't spend at least a few moments talking about Nicholson, since it is `Jack Nicholson Friday'.  His performance here is one that slowly creeps up on you.  For the first half of the film he seemed like nothing more than a background character to me, but as the film progressed and his character's intentions and motives started to unveil themselves I started to find that he was all I could think about.  Even when he wasn't on the screen I could feel his presence in the eyes of Keaton (another testament to her BRILLIANT performance) and long after the film is through I can still feel the impact of his advances.  It is a small performance from someone who is usually larger than life, but for me that makes this one all the more special.<br /><br />If you love broadly stroked epic films that embody the screen with rich characters, tightly woven plots and beautiful scenery, `Reds' is a film for you.  One of those biopics that feels like so much more because it is so much more.  This film defies genre for me, for it covers everything, and it does so without ever missing a beat.r BRILLIANT performance) and long after the film is through I can still feel the impact of his advances.

1840225564|5.0|Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.<br /><br />And  Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of Austen's finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy -- and her prejudice against him builds after he sabotages her sister's love match, and the charming Wickham drops some shocking claims about Darcy's nastiness. But the facts are very different -- and when scandal hits the Bennett family, Darcy may be their only hope. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.<br /><br />Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to break it off. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.<br /><br />And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland is taken under the wing of the Tilney family, and especially handsome Henry -- and learns a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy. The problem is, life isn't that simple -- and neither is love. And as an addition to Austen's main body of work, this edition includes the novella \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.<br /><br />The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").<br /><br />Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongsideLizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her major finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.Lizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her major finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.
B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I enjoyed reading this very much. While not of the erotic kind, I found the story line easy to follow and the charactors are quite likable and able to be identified with. Recommeded for anyone looking for an adventerous vampric romance novel without the gorry scenes or overly sexual erotic couplings. I do enjoy the erotic vampric novels but found this story quite pleasant. Enjoy!
B000056HE9|3.0|Heaven can wait!<br /><br />Even though it does not come close to capturing the Christmas spirit as its contemporary, It's a Wonderful Life, [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO It's a Wonderful Life (60th Anniversary Edition)]] The Bishop's Wife does have some charming parts to it.  Not withstanding the fact that it was nominated Best Picture in 1947, I felt the story went a bit slow, the whole \\"tempted angel\\" thing didn't fly, and David Niven was relegated to a jealous husband \\"comedy.\\"<br /><br />David Niven plays the bishop of this parish -- not fully explained.  I would have liked to have seen more back-story.  Some of that is furnished through Loretta Young's character, who plays the wife, who pines for the good old days when her husband was more concerned with the parishioners and less concerned with kowtowing the local wealthy biddies for money to build his cathedral.<br /><br />The only way he will get a cathedral is by making it in honor of his wealthy patron, Mrs. Hamilton, who keeps rubbing it in that he became bishop in the first place because of her.<br /><br />Cary Grant appears on the scene and though he does a few interesting tricks, it's not super outlandish (as in a Mr. Topper ghost-type movie -- [[ASIN:B0002Y186E Topper Returns]]) but does talk to a typewriter which dutifully records a Christmas sermon.<br /><br />The skating sequence is a bit much, and you can tell the stunt doubles were probably Olympic skaters -- can't imagine Loretta Young doing a few spins around the lake and Dudley jumping about -- with a taxi cabbie for company!<br /><br />The story does  not center a lot on the bishop as Cary the Angel (Dudley of all names) starts making time with his wife.  They go skating together, he charms her in a taxi, he gets boys to sing Christmas songs and little girls to swoon at the story of David and the Lion.<br /><br />The bishop getting jealous and hateful, of not taking the high ground and groveling the rich widow was a bit much.  The Angel was making time with his wife and she had no clue?  Even in 1947 I think that was a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />[SPOILER] The ending was unusual: The Angel does not get the girl, the bishop does not get a cathedral, but he does realize that his family is more important than money.  OK, fine.  Not super satisfying, but could be on your holiday DVD list of movies to watch.<br /><br />The DVD only had a trailer and scene selection.

0670021652|5.0|I enjoyed Committed, although I'll readily admit, it's a book I probably would not have read if it hadn't been by the author of Eat, Pray, Love. Gilbert's name (and fame) hooked me and consequently, I learned a whole lot about marriage that I otherwise would've missed. I enjoy Gilbert's fresh style and I like the way she synthesizes. Gilbert, in my opinion, is first and foremost a dedicated researcher who gleans information from historical research (The Rutgers Report, Marriage for Moderns, Holmes-Rahe Scale, scientific and political texts), philosophy, literature, and (not surprisingly) religion. She has a way of integrating snippets from all of her sources that enhance interest and she draws conclusions that are stimulating. She lightens what could be a heavy experience by weaving her personal story and humorous anecdotes throughout. For instance, when a bride to be asked her mother, \\"Do all brides feel this terrified when they're about to get married?\\" The mother replies, \\"Only the ones who are actually thinking.\\" Gilbert has a keen feel for the type of humor that results when we recognize truth. Toward the end, she admits, \\"This entire book...has been an effort to search through the complex history of Western marriage until I could find some small place of comfort in there for myself.\\" She obviously has succeeded in her quest because she was finally able to \\"relax into (her) own acceptance\\" of marriage. And via Committed, I believe that others can possibly gain insight that will enhance their \\"own little corner within matrimony.\\" Good job, Liz, and may all be well with you and your \\"One.\\"

She seems like a down to earth person I could get a drink with! but thats not whats amazing whats amazing is that I am 26, 5'2 and have been fighting with 25 lbs for the last 4 years of my life. I lost some one and when they passed i went to 155 lbs!! and when i am happy with my weight I am 115- so i was around 145 after the mourning (May) and I decided i was losing my weight! I had exercised before and like violet zaki and kendall hogan and a few others but i stumbled on Jillian!! I did one level one workout of the 30 day shred and was hooked!!!! you sweat you really sweat and you push yourself harder and harder each time! by august i was 120 - I  have such a a better body, and am eating healthier and have awesome muscles and feel great. I am still doing it not everyday but 3x a week i do her workouts . if you get your diet together this sis a sure fire way to tone up those muscles and shed that extra fat!!!! I lOVE JILLIAN for helping me get my body back!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|As many other reviews have stated, this movie is totally different then what I expected!  I believed it would be focused on the \\"Basterds\\" and Pitt as their leader.  However, a whole other story featuring a French Jewish woman named Shoshanna, aka Emmanuelle, took the main focus off the film.  The \\"Basterds'\\" and Shoshanna's paths are not related until they both plan to take out almost the whole Nazi party, even Hitler himself, at a movie premiere.  Their plans succeed, however Shoshanna and nearly all of the \\"Basterds\\" die in the process.      I would have loved to see more of the Basterds' exploits and they were clearly my favorite characters, aside from Christoph Waltz.  Brad Pitt did a good job of playing Lieutenant Aldo Raine, but could have brought more to the character.  His second in command Donny Donowitz, Eli Roth, is my favorite Basterd along with the recruited Gestapo murderer Hugo Stiglitz.  I would be overjoyed if Tarantino made a prequel to this, but I'm sure those chances are quite slim.      I highly recommend this movie to everyone.  It does not follow history at all, but does portray the war in a different light that is not at all disrespectful to veterans.
0312427573|5.0|No one is likable and everyone is out for themselves in this book ... captures the 1980's to perfection. So many elements of the 1980's are captured in this book, but the greatest feature is ego unchecked. From the opening scene where the mayor gets hit by a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise and all he could think of was, \\"who would bring a half-eaten jar of mayonnaise to a public rally,\\" to lawyers vainly feeling their muscles in the \\"tricep-ich,\\" this book pulsates with the blood of the 80's. Sherman McCoy - a WASP junk bond salesman, accidentally hits a black youth that was talked into trying to rob him in the Bronx. The narration is omnipresent which makes this book the power that it is. Wolfe acts as if God Almighty is writing this book and passing judgment all along the route. He has plenty of material to work with as the cast grows with each page. The ending is characteristic of Wolfe's work and the 80's. Of all I read of Wolfe (and he is a great author) this is his finest work. No single bit of work has captured with satire one era more successfully than \\"Bonfire.\\"
B001S86J1C|4.0|I love this movie, timeless is the word for it, even though the characters are alot older than now, but it could still be done today as it was then.  A boy skipping school, with his friends to have \\"fun\\" during what seems to be close to summertime 72 degress in Chicago, come on that has to be summer weather for a town known for cold weather.<br />The Blu ray did not look any better than I remember the DVD being on my Sony Bravia TV.<br />But it still a classic and good way to remember the cast as they were in the hey day and to remember one of the greatest directors/writers/producers of the 80 Genre ( John Hughes died 2009)<br /><br />RIP John we will miss you.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Star Trek has definitely returned with a vengeance, this film not only can attract the hardcore fans (Trekkies) but non-fans as well.  The most interesting fact about the film is that the canon set up in the old Star Trek series isn't changed as the movie takes place in alternate timeline separate from the original series. The cast is phenomenal, if not perfect. Chris Pine is a great Kirk, cocky and ready to fight. Zachary Quinto of Heroes fame is by far my favorite in the film, playing the legendary Spock. The original Spock actor, Leonard Nimoy also makes a appearance as the older Spock (and the original Spock from the original timeline). Simon Pegg of Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz also is a spectacular choice for Scotty.<br /><br />The film is basically a Star Trek version of the original Star Wars (A New Hope), it is well-paced and never dull unlike the past Star Trek films and television series which I have great respect for but could get quite boring at times. Although the film is primarily full of action, however, unlike other films such as [[ASIN:B001KZIRM2 Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Two-Disc Special Edition) [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B002NXSRX4 G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra (Two-Disc Edition + Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]] the plot of this film actually makes sense instead of just containing mindless action.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray special features are amazing! The first disc contains a fantastic and informative as well as entertaining commentary with director J.J. Abrams and the creators. The second disc, the special features disc is just jam-packed with so much behind-the-scenes content and documentaries. That disc alone is reason enough to buy this version of the film. The third disc contains the simple digital copy as well as a free trial demo to the Star Trek D.A.C. game for Xbox Live Arcade and Playstation Network.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this to ANY movie buff or sci-fi fan. If you didn't like Star Trek before (like me), you will definitely love it now.
B002QH2NUA|2.0|I used to be a HUGE Macca fan and couldn't wait for the release of his cd's  However, since Flaming Pie, the man hasn't put out anything worth buying.  4 lame studio LP's,   and 2 live cd's that are difficult to listen to mainly because his voice at this point  is shot.    Like a couple of other reviewers, this \\"auto tune\\" to his voice (which I assume is to compensate for  the lack of range) is just painful to hear.  My all time fav song is Jet and when I heard it , I just   cringed.  As with many of the songs on here, they just all sound out of key.  Maybe its the musician  in me (drummer, guitarist, keyboardist), but I picked up on this straight away and it just ruined  the whole experience for me because this cd had an awesome set list (hence the two stars instead of one),   which was the reason for me getting it.    Oh well, nothing lasts forever and Paul has certainly earned the right to do what he wants, just that  some people need to know when to let go as well.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|You wouldn't think that an animated feature could so beautifully encapsulate heartbreak and loneliness while also being ultimately uplifting and hopeful.  But Up manages to accomplish this feat in such a fully realized way that I consider it the best movie I've seen all year.  It's marketed for kids (mostly), and they will certainly be able to enjoy it on a much more basic level, but all adults should see it too.  I promise that you will not be disappointed!
B00006I53S|3.0|I just received this lens.  Shipped UPS.  Came in a plain white box with a sticker on it that said Canon.  One wrap of bubble wrap.

We shall see how it works, but I'm not very excited by the state of this thing so far.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre has done it again!!<br /><br />Northanger Abbey is definately Austen's most obscure story, with the least developed characters, but for all that, this movie is a fantastic adaptation.  I'm an avid Austen fan (heck all things period drama fan) and have seen every movie adaptation of all her books and do you know what's funny?  I keep finding Northanger Abbey at the top of my list!  Seriously, I'll be sitting at work and then I will just think \\"I have to go home and watch Northanger!\\"  It's so well done and always puts me in a good mood.<br /><br />Masterpiece made this gotic tale into a sweet, funny and endearing movie.  I smile the entire time I'm watching it and its become my standard \\"go-to\\" movie whenever I need something to watch.  The girl who plays Catherine is completely believable as the navie imaginative girl she's suppose to be, and Henry Tilney is downright charming (keep an eye out for all the sensitive looks he gives her when they are dancing or talking...she's so oblivious!).  The actor's performance has rocketed Tilney onto the list of my top three favorite period drama men (placing him with the likes of John Thornton and Fitzwilliam Darcy).  His tender teasing of Catherine and the way he wears his heart on his sleeve to her (there is no doubting that he likes her at first meeting and he makes no mystery about being jealous of the other guy) is so different from the rest of Austen's heros - its refreshing.<br /><br />I recommend giving this adaptation of Northanger Abbey a try - even if you have reservations because its not your favorite book.  This one is a breath of fresh air and I promise you, if you watch it, you'll love it...and I dare you not to fall in love with this Henry Tilney.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Stop looking, this is the best adaptation of Jane Eyre you will ever find.  I've seen all of them, and until this one I was a die-hard fan of the A&E remake, but the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre one takes the cake and then some.  I will never watch the A&E one again, it'll only ever be this one for me from now on.<br /><br />I am not embarrassed to admit that I watched this movie three times the first week I owned it (yes...I know...that's 12 hours of my life...if you think that's bad don't ask how many hours I've spent watching BBC's North and South) really...it's that good.<br /><br />Jane Eyre is my favorite romance story of all times, so I have a high bar, and this movie surpassed what I expected from reading the book.  Toby Stephens is amazing as Rochester, and all the other parts are fairly well cast.  The girl who plays Adell is a little too old for the role, but I get why they had to do that so she looked normal in the ending shot when time was suppose to have passed by at least 4 years..  In Masterpiece Theatre style, the movie follows the book very closely and the changes that are made are still in line with how the characters in the book would act.  It's four hours long, which might intimidate some people, but honestly those hours fly by.

B001UV4XUG|2.0|(500) Days of Summer is allegedly a quirky romantic comedy. It's actually the tale of a sad man (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who falls in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel) even though she tells him she's not into relationships. Then, of course, he gets mad at her for not wanting to be in a relationship and proceeds to mope. The film is slightly bearable because it's not told in chronological order. The narrative bounces between the happy days (double digits days of summer) to the miserable (far too many).<br /><br />It's clear I was not a fan of this film. I wanted to like it. I laughed a few times, but I never identified with any of the characters. Summer is presented as this magical being who has never paid full price for anything, even an apartment because everyone is so wowed by her. I didn't see it (no disrespect to Ms. Deschanel, who is lovely, but not so lovely to be the most perfect, idealized woman ever). She has no story in this film. She's new in town, and she has no friends of family, but she also has no depth. The entire film is the self-absorbed tale of Tom (Gordon-Levitt), but it comes off as an incredibly personal story that does not translate into the shared coming of age story and never has the passion to make it an accessible love story. It struck me as the story you write during month two of your broken heart that you later make fun of and ask your friends, \\"why didn't you tell me how pathetic and desperate I sounded?,\\" and they remind you that they did just that, but you wouldn't listen. Tom has two friends, one is Matthew Gray Gubler (Dr. Reid on Criminal Minds, one of my favorite shows) who plays the exact same character here.<br /><br />I don't even think I could recommend seeing this movie, and I know many people loved it. If you want a quirky love story, see Before Sunrise and Before Sunset.

Don't Fall, Thursday's Child, Second Skin are some of the best progressive rock songs ever written. \\"When you fail to make the connection, you know how precious it is.\\" Chameleons never sold out, never became a corporation, stayed true to the music from on high, channelled with a wall of sound, transcendental but can nail you to the floor.

0743298039|1.0|I've been reading this book for what feels like an eternity! This book is incredibly boring and I honestly don't care at all about any of the characters.  The only reason I continue reading it is because once I start a book I feel like I have to finish it.  I'll be really glad when I finally finish this one!
B000WQWPKA|4.0|More then a decade after the release of 90's mega-hit Independence Day, I'm still amazed, and amused at the people who insist on questioning the science behind. I have heard it all: The physics are wrong, those ships couldn't possibly hover above those cities without causing damage, military jets can't do that and don't even get me started on the nukes... you get the picture. It really brings a smile to my face. Then there are those who question the film's virtues on plot, story, characters and acting. Those people (even if they have a point) also make me laugh.<br /><br />Quite simply, those people simply don't get it. Independence Day is not, and was never meant to be \\"scientificaly accurate\\". In fact, it was never meant to be taken as high drama or be an award contender (although those special effects deserve mention). Independence Day is a campy, tongue-in-cheek tribute to 50's sci-fi and you know what? I'm fine with that. It's the perfect pop-corn film. Before Roland Emmerich found success (thanks to this film) and tried to make the end of the world his ongoing obsession (along with taking himself too seriously) he made two gems that us movie fans will love forever: Stargate and this film. The merits and flaws of this film have been discussed ad nauseaum so let's look at the blu-ray release.<br /><br />First the transer which, I think, is pretty outstanding. Considering this film was made way before the advent of HD, the film looks quite beautiful. Colors are bright and natural, textures are well defined.The military uniforms are a perfect example of this. There are a few flaws here and there but nothing major. There is some grain but I'm fine with that. It is film after all. A scene or two might look soft but again, unless you are looking for the specifics you will hardly notice. Even the effects, which were done right before the onset of CGI hold up very well. All the model work, motion control shots and blue screen compositions look seamless. This is especially noteworthy because High Definition has a tendency to reveal stuff that filmakers thought would stay hidden thanks to the \\"character\\" of traditional film. In this case, the hiding was very well done or the people who transfered the film really did their homework. By the way, if you own any type of Home Theater setup, get ready to get your senses attacked. The mix is pretty outstanding too.<br /><br />On the special features front, this release has a major flaw: It does not include the extended version of the Ultimate Edition DVD. It only includes the theatrical version which is fine but here is the thing: The best extra by far in the package is the pop-up track that gives you little details of the film and it's production as you watch the film. The track is very insightful and fans of the film will really enjoy learning all the details, bloopers and stories. The problem is the track mentions the extended scenes of the DVD several times and makes you wonder why the heck didn't they just include them. In fact there is a lot of extras missing that were in the Ultimate Edition. One could argue that some of that stuff is outdated but they did include the original commentary track from the DVD and that certainly has not aged well. So what gives? My guess? Independence Day: Super-Mega-Ultra-Ultimate Blu-Ray 15th(or 20th) Anniversary Edition. You know how it goes.<br /><br />Independence Day is a very entertaining film and it has aged very well. The transfer is awsome and looks great in HD. Some might hesitate knowing that there will probably a bigger release with more and newer features down the road but in my opinion the price of this blu-ray disc has come down enough to not feel too guilty about it.lly noteworthy because High Definition has a tendency to reveal stuff that filmakers thought would stay hidden thanks to the \\"character\\" of traditional film.

B002ZG997M|4.0|\\"The Book of Eli\\", written by Gary Whitta and directed by Albert and Allen Hughes.<br /><br />Post nuclear holocaust; Times are very bleak. Water and food are scarce and the lands are ruled by raiders and cannibals. Eli (Denzel Washington) makes his way west on foot diligently reading every night. Eventually he stumbles onto a small town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman). Carnegie is in search of a very special book, one that is now very rare. It turns out that Eli has the very book and Carnegies will do anything to get it...<br /><br />\\"The Book of Eli\\" was a decent watch. I didn't go in with super high expectations but actually enjoyed it. It isn't a life changer but a watchable popcorn flick.<br /><br />The Good: The story was well written and the performances by all the actors were enjoyable. I always like Gary Oldman and while this wasn't his best character his performance as always was top notch.<br /><br />The Bad: I feel like they washed out a little too much of the color in the film. I realize the point was for effect but wish they would have left a little more in.<br /><br />Overall: \\"The Book of Eli\\" is a decent movie worth checking out.
1416561471|5.0|This is a review of the version, with a cover that was defiantly made to be provocative. It depicts an (ape) allying view of going from all fours to upright. If this is what you are looking for then you need to read \\" 2001: A Space Odyssey\\" by Arthur Charles Clarke.<br /><br />This is a quick review of the book not a dissertation on Darwin or any other subject loosely related. At first, I did not know what to expect. I already read \\" The Voyage of the Beagle: Charles Darwin's Journal of Researches\\" (see my review). I figured the book would be similar. However, I found \\"Origin\\" to be more complex and detailed.<br /><br />Taking in account that recent pieces of knowledge were not available to Charles Darwin this book could have been written last week. Having to look from the outside without the knowledge of DNA or Plate Tectonics, he pretty much nailed how the environment and crossbreeding would have an effect on natural selection. Speaking of natural selection, I thought his was going to be some great insight to a new concept. All it means is that species are not being mucked around by man (artificial selection).<br /><br />If you picked up Time magazine today you would find all the things that Charles said would be near impossible to find or do. Yet he predicted that it is doable in theory. With an imperfect geological record, many things he was not able to find at the writing of this book have been found (according to the possibilities described in the book.)<br /><br />The only draw back to the book was his constant apologizing. If he had more time and space he could prove this and that. Or it looks like this but who can say at this time. On the other hand, the same evidence can be interpreted 180 degrees different.<br /><br />In the end, it is worth reading and you will never look at life the same way again.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316109339 The Ascent of Man by Jacob Bronowski]]

That's the sort of thing you come up with when you're 12 and a write a story.<br /><br />After all the hype I was incredibly disappointed. Maybe I'm not a big enough believer in pixie dust and unicorns...

While your at it how about another Superman.Yes I'm not a fan of this idea by any means.Isn't Jeremy Brett about the final thought on Holmes?

Any big budget movie that has no cusing and not one sex scene is pretty weird in todays world but this one does it with style and inteligence.<br />Do yourself a favor, sit down, buckle up, and open your mind and youll have a great time.

0143038419|4.0|I was surprised to see how many negative reviews there are about this book.  It is a beautiful story of one woman's journey to loving herself. Whether it is by traveling for a year or doing something else it is a beautiful thing to find a way to take the time to learn who you really are and to love yourself anyway.  For all of those women out there writing reviews that criticize Elizabeth for referring to herself in positive ways and who are calling her self absorbed, you are only perpetuating the stigma that woman should only speak of themselves in self deprecating ways.  This is a beautiful read and a wonderful reminder to us all of how important it is to be true to yourself.
B002T9H2L0|2.0|Quite simply, the film is a Jewish Revenge Fantasy, and is fairly decent if you accept that when you watch it.  It was definitely not quite what I was expecting.  I expected the movie to be more about the \\"Basterds\\" and them kicking the crap out of every German they came across. It wasn't.  It was more about a Jewish woman's plan to get revenge on the Nazis for killing her family.  The \\"Basterds\\" seemed to hardly even be in the film.  As other reviewers have said, the movie is very dialogue driven, with most of it subtitled German and French.  It can be interesting at times, and dull at others.      I enjoyed parts of the movie, but there weren't enough of those parts to really recommend the film to most viewers.  Honestly the only people I can whole-heartedly recommend this to, are Jewish people with an undying hatred of everything German. If you're in that category, you should without a doubt see this movie, and consider my 2-star rating a 4 or 5 star one instead.    As for people who just love seeing Nazis get wasted on film, I'm afraid there isn't actually much of that in the movie.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|This is Sam Rockwell's film, make no mistake of it.  There is rarely ever anyone else on-screen, and his role is complicated enough that he has to run the gamut of emotions in a very short frame of time.  I can think of very few actors who can pull off this performance, and Rockwell is at the top of that list.  Duncan Jones's directing is superb, and Nathan Parker's screenplay is almost flawless, but without Rockwell, this film would merely be a well-thought, intellectual mess.<br /><br />Rockwell plays Sam bell, an astronaut approaching the end of his three-year solo term on the moon.  The time's been getting to him, however; he's been all alone except for the company of a robotic construction (voiced by Kevin Spacey, and his voice is so perfect for the role, one wonders how he hasn't done this before).  Sam begins seeing things...and then he's involved in an accident, and when he comes to, things just aren't the same.  To say more would be to ruin the experience.  And yet, here's the great thing about MOON: it's not one of those twist-based sci-fi films.  There is a twist, but it comes relatively early in the film, and the rest of the movie builds upon it, layering characterization on top of plot.  This is a character study, a thoughtful science fiction film in the vein of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (which is a far superior film, of course; but if you hated that movie, you probably won't like MOON, either).  This isn't a movie for action buffs, or alien-based sci-fi films; MOON is for people who like their science fiction with some depth and emotional resonance.  And if you're just a fan of acting--check out Rockwell.  His performance is worth the price of admission alone.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is one nice little flash. I bought this as a fast and dirty backup flash for my SB600 and found that I use this about equally with the SB600. It works with any Nikon camera that has the i-TTL or CLS flash system built in, which is just about any Nikon built after the D2. I have used this on the D40, D60, D90 and D700 and it works flawlessly. So small it fits in my pocket and it only sips the juice out of the battery. I had to shoot a reception line in this tiny low ceiling room and it worked better than the SB600, with the flash head tilted up to 90 degrees, I was bouncing the light off a ceiling only three feet over my head and getting the exact exposure I wanted, the SB600 was bringing the background illumination up to foreground levels. Several people have said you could not bounce this flash when used vertical, but that's not true.  I shoot about 30 percent of my shots vertical and simply leave the flash head at zero degrees and attach a piece of plastic that is black on one side and white on the other with velcro to the SB400. For those new to external flash this will take your shots from the snapshot look to the pro look with a very small learning curve. For Pros, this is a nice little addition to your bag of lighting tricks and it's light on the wallet. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve the lighting on their photos without breaking the bank.
B002NXSRVG|2.0|We received this movie from Netflix by accident, so we decided to give it a try.  Simply put, this movie is so weak that we had to bail out after half an hour, rather than wasting even more time by finishing it.<br /><br />There's plenty of action, the special effects are good, and there's eye-candy for the guys.  But the plot is utterly juvenile and the acting is weak.  The actor playing the lead character is particularly bad.<br /><br />If you're a 12-year-old boy and you like blowing things up, you might like this movie.  Otherwise, be sure to skip it.  I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) only because of the special effects.
B002U6CJO2|5.0|You can not talk about cyberpunk without bringing up this one! This is the movie that even anime haters have seen and liked. Mamoru Oshii, director of Sky Crawlers and Patlabor pioneered anime sci-fi in the 90s with this film adaptation of Masamune Shirow's manga series.<br /><br />Set in a future where androids and cyborgs are commonplace, a special Japanese enforcer unit called Section 9 gets called into handle cybercrimes and sticky foreign affairs. Matoko is a major on this team, and she and her partner Batou get called into handling a case on the illusive hacker known as the Puppet Master. After trailing some unsuspecting garbage collectors, they think they have their man, but he turns out to be another puppet himself. Then, a robot body escapes from a government cybernetics lab, and is brought into Section 9 headquarters. Two agents from the rival Section 6 show up to claim it saying that was now hosting the cybernetic essence referred to as a \\"ghost\\" of the Puppet Master. It reveals itself to be a living entity that was created by Section 6 to control people's ghosts, and its come to Section 9 seeking asylum. Commandos make off with the body, so Matoko and Batou take off after their getaway car. Matoko corners them in an abandonned church, although the car is protected by a robot spider tank(not a Tachikoma, BTW). She almost gets crushed by the tank, but Batou manages to stop it with a bigass gun. Matoko then dives into the Puppet Master, and he reveals to her that arranged all this in attempt to merge his programming with her ghost in order to create an entirely new lifeform. Matoko doesn't get a chance to disagree as both she and the Puppet Master's body's are totalled by Section 6 agents. Hours later, Batou was able to salvage what there was of Matoko's ghost into the robot body of a young girl, although she claims she is now longer Matoko or the Puppet Master, but their composite prodigy. She then leaves planning to spread herself throughout the net.<br /><br />This movie was one of the few to actually be released in U.S. theatres in the 90s. The blend of computer graphics with Oshii's dynamic animation direction is superb. It's influence is apparent in several other American productions like Batman Beyond, The Matrix and Equilibrium. The film itself spawned off a sequal, Ghost In The Shell: Innocence, plus the Stand Alone Complex anime TV series which has a movie followup and two compilation movies. The original was recently redone in a new version, Ghost In The Shell 2.0, which is the same film, but now with new 3D graphics which add a definate bonus to it, and not in some lame Star Wars: Special Edition way.

0307454541|1.0|I was enthralled by the beautifully detailed and no non-sense mystery plot and I could not keep the book down for the first 80% of it. But the story took a cheesy turn when the Blomkvist - the main investigator - walks to the murderer's house with no arms even though the latter had tried to shoot him within the last few days. Of course a whole lot of Hollywood action follows and Blomkvist is \\"almost\\" killed. The ending of the book was so far removed from the rest of the book that I had to push myself to complete it. I would not mind if the whole book was cheesy. But this was more like a Hollywood action thriller ending to a Charles Dickens book. If the author was obliged to show some action at least he could have created the scenario for the action in a more consistent way. Anyway at least I got to know what is the currency of Sweden.

B001FB562U|5.0|Forget the explosions and bombastic nature of 2012.  Excluding the zombification angle of [[ASIN:B0013FDM7E I Am Legend]], the post-apocalyptic world will resemble John Hillcoat's The Road - a movie based upon a novel by Cormac McCarthy.  The end of civilization will be a grim, desolate erosion into inhuman behavior for most, as those who are left revert toward instinct while a select minority grasp morality and optimism like the final survivors of [[ASIN:B000RAPYEA On the Beach]].<br /><br />Roughly a decade after some catastrophic event has ravaged the world, a man (Viggo Mortenson), his wife (Charlize Theron), and their son (Kodi Smit-McPhee) fearfully struggle to survive, scavenging whatever they can to nourish their increasingly emaciated bodies, and looking over their shoulder whenever the wind howls or a floorboard creaks.  Told through flashbacks, the man wishes to be thankful, and to hold on to precious life while the mother believes the only feasible option lies within the fateful crank of a revolver and a few remaining bullets.<br /><br />Awash in hues of light blue and gray, the world itself is a rival, devoid of animals or plant-life, providing nearly no support.  The locations and filming aid the depressed feeling as each devastating frame bleeds hope dry.  The world exudes death.  The lack of cause regarding Earth's demise is inconsequential; the care for history is disregarded.  For the man and his boy, only the struggle to survive and appreciation of every hushed breath are important.  The man and his son pilgrimage south towards uncertainty and the hope of possible sustenance.  The story unfolds like an good versus evil parable, as the pair must avoid the \\"bad guys,\\" those who have devolved towards murder, rape, and cannibalism as a means for survival; and hope for the \\"good guys,\\" like an old man (Robert Duvall) they happen upon during their march south.  It's a world so foreign that a flat coke is better than ten Christmas mornings, and the concept of a meat locker takes on a vision as gruesome as any I've seen on film (the scene haunts me days after its viewing).<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is a bit slow, with the first two acts slowly destroying hope, but that's the purpose.  Gut wrenchingly realistic, only the hope and optimism of the man and his boy shine brightly as they \\"carry the fire\\" to live.<br /><br />In a Hollywood landscape saturated with unoriginality, The Road is authentically barren and depressing.  More than likely, the stark realities of survival paint a picture of the future in blood with a fibula paintbrush.  For the post-apocalyptic pessimist like myself, this incredible film represents reality, and Academy Awards should be awarded en masse to all involved, especially Viggo Mortenson.  Witnessing his performance, and drastic weight loss similar to Christian Bale's commitment in [[ASIN:B0007Y08QA The Machinist]], reminds one of the soul-crushing appearances in Holocaust photos.

1600242774|5.0|Dear John is one of my favorite novels by Nicholas Sparks.  I found the story to be a very engaging bittersweet romance.<br /><br />John Tyree has led the life of a rebel.  Finding that his life is leading nowhere, he joins the military.  While home during a furlough, John meets Savannah, a beautiful young college student.  Savannah is with a group of students who are on a habitat for humanity mission.  John and Savannah quickly discover that they are soul mates and fall deeply in love.  John has to return to the military, but the two know that they will be together when John's stint in the military is up. Unfortunately September 11th happens and John reenlists.  Savannah finds it difficult to not have John with her  . . . and as the title of the books suggests, there are difficult choices ahead for our two lovers.  The ending was unexpected for me.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this book.  I loved the romance between John and Savannah.  I also loved that Savannah was able to help John understand his father and have a better relationship with him.  I loved John's dad, he was my favorite secondary character.  What drove me and my book club crazy was some of the choices that Savannah made, but I will not discuss them here and ruin the plot! I thought John was a wonderful hero, lover, and man.  I loved his character development from a troubled youth to a self sacrificing man.  It was also great having characters that were my age living through the same times as myself.  It made it easy to connect with them.  I also loved the old fashioned romance and that Savannah is a Christian and is proud to talk about her beliefs.<br /><br />The audiobook is read by Holter Graham, who also read The Choice (which I also listened to and enjoyed recently).

1600242774|5.0|What is it about a Sparks novel?  It is like this rhythm to these books... almost like the sway of the ocean.... calming.  Yes that's it.  His books are calming.  When I first put this audio in, I had to smile when the narrators  voice came on... there it was.  Just like in the books... this soothing voice.  Ahhhhh... Sparks.<br /><br />  She wore the slightest hint of perfume that reminded me of Paris.... even though I had never been there.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks' story of John, his \\"not so much\\" relationship with his father, and Savannah, the girl with the kind eyes and welcoming smile... wrapped me right into the center of it.  I grew to enjoy the slow narrative drawl of John and liked the twist of this love story - being told from the rebellious Army guys point of view.<br /><br />I learned about Asperger's Disorder and found it a value to the book to put this within the story line.  It was a chance to learn about something I literally knew nothing about.<br /><br />An enjoyable audio with an ending I did not see coming - I highly recommend.
B002LVUG3C|3.0|Yo Bowie! If you bother to read what your fans think about your cds, I wish you would have kept the 1972 album jacket of \\"Space oddity\\". This cd jacket is bloody awful, a real turn-off. Now that the harm is done, you could make more money by putting the same product but with the 1972 jacket so that completists purchase both cds and people with more discriminating taste like me, throw away this ugly duckling and get their hands on the better looking 1972 \\"Space oddity\\" cd jacket.    P.s.: The sound engineers made miracles on this cd.  This use to be a cd you kept as a curiosity if your a Bowie fan, to be listen once and then store in your cd collection, never to see the light of day again.  Now with the major improvements they brought to this lame duck, this product has gone beyon the \\"good\\" category, this is more like, dare a say into the \\"sexy\\" league.
B002A4Q652|4.0|I was walking through the store shortly before the holidays, and I just somehow stumbled upon this CD, which I was attracted to, not because of it's quasi-gothic artistic cover commonplace with the bands I've gotten into over the past 5-6 years or so, but a sign on the front telling me that it's from a former composer of Within Temptation, which is easily one of my favorites of this list of bands I've gotten into.  And so I popped it in, and I listened to it, and for the most part, my high expectations were to an extent met.  All - not most, but all, of these songs have some solid rock elements, some well-composed orchestral elements, and even some slight elements of 'good' pop; that is, that slight bit of bubbly energy and an additional metalic sound, versus something that sounds like Brittany Spears.  However, while this album has no real downers, I can't say that any songs really blew me away.  Let's just say that on my iTunes, I've ranked all the songs a 4/5 rating, none a 5/5, none a 3/5 or lower.    There are a few slight highlights.  The first song, the title song 'April Rain' keeps a nice consistent sound that's always pleasing and fun, if a tad traditional.  And towards the end of the album is 'I'll Reach You', a song which sounds good for the most part, but certainly climaxes with a chorus that sounds like it's from a truly exceptional song; the problem is that the bulk of the song isn't as strong.  The same, or opposite, could be said about the third song, 'Invidia' (no relation, I'm thinking, to the graphics card company NVidia), which starts off truly beautiful, almost hauntingly and mesmerizingly, but during it's chorus, turns almost nasty.  The same types of problems are throughout the album - every song, pretty much, has segments that are excellent, and segments that are just good.    There is also one other thing I should mention, which is that the mixing doesn't seem that great.  The mixing sounds a lot like 'Enter', the first Within Temptation CD,which was well composed as well, but certainly not as sharp-sounding as something such as their later album 'The Silent Force', or Nightwish's 'Dark Passions Play' - if you don't like those albums, just note that I'm merely pointing out the sound quality.  This album is, by contrast, very light on both the lows and highs, mostly in the middle-frequency range.  Luckily, it's clear enough, lacking such problems of other albums like the piano being swallowed up by the guitar/bass.    Overall a good CD - I only discovered moments ago that there was another CD previously released, so I cannot state which is superior, but I can say that if you're a fan of groups like Within Temptation, Nightwish, or particulartly Sirenia, you should get a reasonable amount of enjoyment from this.
B002JM1VJG|4.0|I love having this dvd in my collection.  But to be honest I was dissapointed that there is censoring in the videos.  Why is it that between the cd and dvd there are songs left off(i.e. Bad Girl, This Used To Be Our Playground, etc)?  Is this to keep us wanting more in the future.  Will we ever know.

The story just kind of went flat.  There was an extra chapter to update you on the characters today --- but it really didn't satisfy the reader's questions about what happened, and whether all issues were resolved.  I'm sure the movie will tie it up into a nice little package, as movies tend to do --- but the book did not.

Am I correct are both mixes new.<br />Also will there be more dvd video material.<br />I recall Jamie Muir on the Beat Club 1972 where I have seen Larks I but am aware there was a improv and exiles recorded in MONO on a KCCC.<br />Also Easy Money with a improv from Central Park or on Don Kirchner 1973 I believe. There's even  credits rolling at the end. Will all this be on the hopefully 40th Larks Tongues in Aspic/Starless and Bible Black cd/dvd. With everything remixed ( theres only a few tracks on Starless that are studio most are live and have been already released ( Amsterdam 1973 )<br />Oh isn't 1969/70's KC wonderful :-) and onward.<br /><br />Like Supper's ready by Genesis and The Night Watch that French show from FRANCE \\"MELODY\\" did and ruined some great performances with their primitive cheesy 1970's technology.

0385736002|2.0|This is the first in a six book series by Irish author Michael Scott. A movie version also seems to be in production. When swinging over to Amazon to check out the ratings, I was satisfied with the high marks from over one hundred reviews, so I figured I'd give it a shot.<br /><br />Story overview:<br />---------------<br />In the modern world, Twin siblings, Sophie and Josh Newman (teenagers) work across the street from one other. One day Sophie notices shady looking characters entering the bookstore where her brother works. Among these characters is the underhanded John Dee, whose goal is to capture the owners of the bookstore along with a book that is definitely not for sale on their shelves.<br /><br />This book is called the Codex, which unlocks many of the world's mysteries, including the secret to immortality. The owners of the bookstore are Nicholas Flamel and his wife, Perenelle (who both happen to be immortal, and very old). Dee manages to capture Perenelle and the Codex, but in the process Nicholas escapes with Josh and his sister Sophie. It seems as if all is lost, but then Nicholas learns that--during a struggle--Josh ripped out some of the pages in the book; making the important parts useless.<br /><br />Once Dee discovers this, he pursues Nicholas, Sophie, and Josh to recover the missing pages. Why? Dee seems to be the representative of an ancient race called the Dark Elders, whose mission is to recapture the world from the humans, and somehow they need the book to do this. Nicholas, however, has other plans as he is convinced that these twins are part of an ancient prophecy. With the help of Scathach (a vegetarian vampire (yes, really . . .), and second generation Elder Race), the team goes on an adventure of discovery and retreat.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />-------------<br />OK, so I know this book sounds good. The ratings say it is good. But I had a hard time staying interested. Why? (1) The use of Third Person Multiple Points of View and Omniscient Point of View is jarring and disjointing. I feel as if the author was trying to get into too many heads. And really, I didn't care about John Dee; he was the bad guy, why did I always need to know his perspective? (2) It seemed to me as if there was too much needless information. There were a few times where I yelled, \\"I get it, you don't need to explain it any further!\\" Also, the actions of the characters mostly spoke for themselves, yet the author was always describing them, he described . . . everything. (3) Too much needless back story. A lot of it didn't seem to matter in the forward plot movement. So, my conclusion? I didn't like the writing style all that much. And the story itself didn't pull me in. But, that said, others did like it, so I suggest you see for yourself.<br /><br />Things to consider:<br />------------------<br />There is mention of an old earth, as the Elders lived many years before man. Apparently men came from the apes and messed everything up. I know this is fantasy, but it does take place in the \\"real world\\" and more than subtly promotes the idea of evolution. That, and it highly promotes the modern idea that power comes from within each individual. These and other things mentioned in the story leads to me to wonder if the author's beliefs reside around the modern Humanist Manifesto. (Such as: \\"Humanism believes that man is a part of nature and that he has emerged as a result of a continuous process.\\" And that the universe is self-existing not created.) Just something to keep in mind. There's no real inappropriate language or sexual situations, and the violence level is fitting for this type of tale (and audience). The audience? Boys and girls, probably around their early teens.<br /><br />James D. Maxon<br />Author of Traphis: A Wizard's Taleient Point of View is jarring and disjointing.

B001993Y2C|5.0|After hearing all the gripe about packaging, I explored the UK Blu-ray version.  Including shipping I paid only $152 (152 dollars).  Also, the UK page has incorrect details about the region.  The UK Blu-ray WILL PLAY on a US Blu-ray player; mine is actually a PS3 and it plays perfectly.  So save yourself $40+ bucks and get the better packaging, unless you really, really want the toy.    P.S.  For some reason the UK page shows it for £101.88 but when you check out it's really £86.71. Maybe it's a glitch, but it's true!  Shipping to us is only about £3. At this price, I can re-sell on eBay when I'm done watching and break even, if not make a little money.
B002GSXKN8|2.0|I'll admit that the price is cheap. Having all four films for less than $10 is great, but upon watching the first disc, I find that the quality of the transfer is absolutely terrible. Lots and lots of pixelation artifacts, especially when there's black on the screen, and let's face it, BATMAN was not a brightly lit film. The quality is barely, BAREly above VHS. I feel like they hooked a VCR up to a DVD recorder and had at it. I'm not even talking about grain (which I would expect from an older film transfer), but rather poor resolution. There are no solid diagonal lines, everything is blocky. The video looks like an SVCD that was poorly upconverted to DVD.<br /><br />It's good value, if you're just looking for an affordable way to complete your collection, but if you're used to DVD-quality video, you will be disappointed...
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I loved the Gene Wilder movie, which is magical, so I could not help but compare the two versions.  My comparison forms the basis of my review, so take it with a grain of salt.<br /><br />In comparing, I found this movie worse on most fronts:<br /><br />1) Johnny Depp didn't hold a candle to Gene Wilder.  Depp was bizarre in an unlikeable and unrealistic way.  What was he thinking?  What was Tim Burton thinking?<br /><br />2) The original Grandpa Joe was far better.<br /><br />3) Many of the other characters were just unsuccessfully attempted copies of the original movie's actors.  It was like Tim Burton told the casting directors and actors:  \\"Study the original movie carefully, and copy the original actors as closely as you can.  That's our only hope!\\"<br /><br />4) The Oompa-Loompas were boring and fake and had no spirit.<br /><br />5) The songs had no pizzazz and weren't catchy.  (I still sing the original songs at times.)<br /><br />6) The flashback scenes were dull and unnecessary.<br /><br />I wasn't expecting to like this movie, given what I'd heard about it, but I was still...hoping.  Alas, no dice.
1594488843|5.0|Dan Pink's new book is a must-have read for anyone who owns a company or manages people within an organization.  His notion that people are motivated by things other than the carrot and the stick is right in line with my experiences as a consultant to corporations over the past 15 years.  Pink's ideas may finally unleash a truly engaged and energized workforce and push the information age forward where it needs to be.  Most importantly, it may reduce or eliminate the frustrations that today's leaders and managers have faced by trying to apply antiquated management practices of the past.

0385341008|5.0|I had been looking at this book for quite awhile, and had considered purchasing, but was worried about the title, and not sure that it would end up being what I thought it was. This book totally exceeded my expectations! I loved the format of letters and cables written between the main character Juliet and her closest friends Sidney and Sophia, as well as the residents of the Island of Guernsey. The book really offers such a different perspective on WWII, as seen through the eyes of the resident of this small island. I actually cried in the end, and its been a long time since I book made me cry. I highly recommend this novel, and I hope that someday they make it into a movie!
B0027BOL4G|2.0|From the preview, I thought this film was going to be a bit more encompassing, since \\"documentary\\" somewhat implies an objective and fairminded analysis.  However, this was mostly a one-sided (from the liberal perspective) demonization of the timeworn target, the \\"large multinational corporation\\".  That's not to say the \\"one side\\" doesn't have a few good points, such as the excessive heavy-handedness of a few big companies in their attempt to legally bully the smaller, independent agricultural farmer or worker.      Where the movie got somewhat off track, however, was with the myopic viewpoint that all non-organic large-scale consolidation and mechanization of the agricultural/food industry is evil and contrary to the well-being of our planet and its citizens.  In fact, the mass production techniques in effect today, as well as genetic food engineering, are primarily responsible for allowing smaller parcels of arable land to feed ever-increasing world populations -- and the paramount reasons that the USA has become the world's breadbasket in times of peace and catastrophe (do you see any other countries shipping huge amounts of foodstuffs to the recent Haitian disaster sites?).      To cast a pall of Maximum Evil onto the large food producers, the film made liberal use (no pun intended) of the mechanism of scrolling \\">>>insert food corporation's name here<<< DECLINED TO BE INTERVIEWED FOR THIS FILM\\" past your view screen. Although a somewhat passe technique, if they truly wanted to include a voice from the \\"other side\\", the producers COULD have obtained the countervailing viewpoints from the established industry spokespersons -- such as the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the US Poultry & Egg Association, etc.      And of course, no left-slanting film would be complete without your hearing the mantra of \\"global warming\\" a time or two -- despite that concept becoming more laughable with every passing day as newer, more accurate revelations leak out from thetrue scientific community (those not yet corrupted by \\"climate politics\\" and its money-driven propaganda machine).  I guess the producers didn't get the memo yet: they're now supposed to call it \\"climate change\\", since the phrase \\"global warming\\" no longer even passes the giggle test.      All in all though, this film was (barely) worth the .99 cent weekend rental price -- that is, if you haven't explored this subject matter previously.  Otherwise, the film is far too weak on content -- no matter which side you're on -- to be a \\"buy\\".

B0013FBS20|5.0|I read the \\"I am legend\\" book. It was a piece of garbage. If you were disappointed because they did not follow the book, most American literatures need to be re-written. If they followed the book, it would have been a box-office disaster. These people need to make money. I found the \\"I am legend\\" book to be boring and past its time. There is a funeral plot and grave out there waiting for this book.

B002NVTBRM|5.0|This album is a bit different from your first listen of \\"Bullets\\" from the original 7\\" record. Sometimes years of playing and gigging can change a life, or lives. I remember asking Chris what the next album would sound like after a gig during the \\"End-Start\\" tour. He laughed and said \\"you would probobly know better than me\\" with a laugh. We both agreed that the guitar had been put back a bit and there was more room made for the piano. So, from full on devastating tunes like \\"Munich\\", \\"All Sparks\\", and the soft easy peaceful lament of \\"Distance\\", there became more of a craft to the songwriting on \\"End-Start\\". Many critics said they had become like Colplay. I didn't here that. Nor do I hear any Joy Division in them at all with the exception of the deep nasal vocal. Morrison had it, Curtis had it, and what the heck, so does Paul banks(Interpol)-which sounds more like the Chameleons UK anyway all you citics!!! Wake up and listen! So, as for what I said to Chris about that third album, I said go for the \\"Ocean Rain\\"(Bunnymen)! Instead of strings I heard synth. But it is still very much like orchestration. The synth piece on \\"Papillon\\" is an interweaving loop that seems to swey back and forth up and down the scale. The human drum machine is perfect!LOL. The vocals are strong and robust. Very confident. That is what I love about Tom Toms voice. He really gets his lyric across even if it means banging it out 16 times. Anyway, the instrumentation on this new album and the lyrical context shows immense growth and humility in the face of the all mighty MUSIC INDUSTRY(major label). So if you like EDITORS, buy those CD singles and 7\\" records!!! They would appreciate it. I've collected everything they have released from the beginning and have been listening from the very start. So take it from a dedicated listener, give this album more than a few listens. In fact, try to listen to the entire album from start to finish without a break. Then it speaks. And yeah yeah yeah, every album is going to have its singles that you may hear too much but don't let that ruin an album. This album is a 5 star because it shows growth, creativity, imagination, color, experimentation, emotion(which is hard to capture digitally), energy, and of course that overall sense of a bunch of people all working together to create a strong foundation and build something that is pressed for listeners now and listeners in the future. EDITORS don't seem to be a band that is concerned with money or fame. Its purity. I respect that. I'll support that. Like this! Now go listen to \\"Munich\\" really f'n loud of you never have and tell me that that isn't REAL!!! Oh yeah, the new album is definately reccomended. Thanks for reading....and its EDITORS, not \\"THE editors\\". ;-) Looking forward to the show guys! I'll bring my own Sharpie this time!

B002ZG997M|4.0|Denzel Washington's Eli, in The Book of Eli is walking through a post-apocalyptic American west. A blanched and bleaching landscape that more resembles the moon than Earth, and where sunglasses and Chapstick are used as money. We can only guess at what happened and Eli only tells us about \\"the flash\\" and a hole was torn in the atmosphere. Eli is heading \\"west\\" toward an uncertain destination like a post-apocalyptic Shaolin priest to deliver a book to unknown people who may be able to use the book to restart civilization.<br /><br />Eli is a survivor, as he travels the destroyed roads of civilization his skills have become finely honed, he can smell the camouflaged highwaymen and dispatches them using a machete, or karate and in only extreme cases does he use a gun, he has to conserve bullets.<br /><br />In his travels Eli comes into a town run by Gary Oldman's Carnegie, a man bent on consolidating and spreading his ruthless rule by sending out the highwaymen to search for books. One book in particular, a book that will give him the power to manipulate people so he can extend his ruthless influence. Humorously, Carnegie orders the DaVinci Code and Oprah magazine burned, or is it a sly commentary on the impermanence of pop culture? Carnegie discovers Eli has the book he's looking for and tries to trade for it with water and failing that, his daughter Solara (Mila Kunis). Eli isn't the type of man Carnegie is used to dealing with and Eli leaves, but not without killing many of Carnegie's men.<br /><br />Roger Ebert in his review said the ending has a WTF moment and I expected some horrible inconsistency or deus ex-machina but I found the ending consistent with the rest of the movie and plausible within the world in which the characters find themselves. There is one minor inconsistency in the plot that is never explained. Eli locks Solara in a cave but mysteriously enough and without explanation in the next scene she's chasing after Eli.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is one of the few actors whose movies I'll go see without knowing too much about the movie and his performance is his usual rock solid characterization. He plays Eli very subtly and with few words but emotion that pulls you in. Gary Oldman is as creepy or maybe creepier than he was in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Or maybe it was the Hughes Brothers decision to film Oldman with every crevice and blemish of his complexion marring his face that defines the character. Mila Kunis as Solara seems to be coming into her own as an actress and is more than able to hold her own in scenes with Washington.<br /><br />Directed by the Hughes Brothers whose previous credits include From Hell they have created a bleak landscape that is devoid of color and use all shades of black, white and gray without the movie being or feeling like it's in black and white.<br /><br />I went to the movie without expecting too much and I reall enjoyed the movie, my verdict? See The Book of Eli for yourself.<br /><br />Note to the Hughes Brothers: Nice reference to A Boy and His Dog in the background in one scene.es I'll go see without knowing too much about the movie and his performance is his usual rock solid characterization.

0547258305|5.0|I bought this for my 14 year old, but after reading the first review saying there were discreet sex scenes and a rejection of the concept of marriage, I thought I should read it first.  I loved the story right from the start, and found Katsa to be a believable heroine, albeit one with super fighting skills.  NO spoiler alert here, but the 2 sex scenes are about as tame as they can be, my kid might not even realize that is what it is.  Each little tryst is over in a paragraph. There is no graphic description of anything, tamer than things she has seen on TV.  If you have read the Twilight series, then be assured this book is far, far cleaner.  As for the rejection of marriage.  Heck, Katsa is young, doesn't want kids, has never been close to anyone, it pretty much fits her character to not want marriage in the book. Plus, who says she won't change her mind? She is still learning to trust people and herself.  I didn't feel it was a major point of the book at all.  Anyways, after reading it, I have no compunction against letting my daughter read it.<br /> The book encompasses long distance adventures, fighting, friendship, romance, loss, and so much more.  Katsa is tough, a bit rough around the edges, humble and learning to accept herself as she is.  Just an all around  entertaining story. Hope there is a sequel to it.

For the most people it gives a good sense what not to do with your money like buying expensive toys when you do make money which gets you further in debt. He teaches the concept which most will not abide by which is to wait to buy luxuries, invest in assets, and then when in a better position purchase the luxuries. It is explained in laymen's terms so the concepts easy to grasp. Great book to start with for the money principles and for teaching people to really learn about their money and finances.     The ways he has made his money is not very attainable for someone with little money. The concept money makes money applies greatly to his book. He had a lot of money to work with to make his money mostly in real estate and stocks. He made a lot of money as a merchant marine as his first job. Then, his first company was international business from the experience he obtained in asia as a merchant marine. Most will not be able to get some of the worldly experience he has to function in foreign markets.     As for his real estate and stock money making, they have flaws. Most real estate examples are  extremely uncommon in how much money he has made. Also, the concepts of buying and selling real estate are outdated and do not apply in today's world. Such as buying houses with little or no money down then selling for double or getting loans with no money down or only 10% are obsolete. The ways he invests in small cap business with extremely high risk and returns is  not for the average investor.     He also discusses where he likes to always pay himself first before he pays his bills and enjoy the creditors chasing after him is ridiculous. He thinks not delaying paying his bills will prompt him into coming up with new ideas on how to make money. He says he has good credit but you would really have to know how credit score are calculated in order to know what bills you can just not pay and which you have to pay. In the real estate world, if you don't have good credit you ain't gonna be in the real estate world.     There are a lot of good points on personal finance but also a lot of flaws on making money to be rich. He has the same angle as most get rich books. They make it seem so easily attainable if you change your thinking and take more risk. But, it is not for the person who has little or no money, it is the person who has some personal wealth and has the ability to leverage it to make more money. Basically, he is obtaining his dream by showing you a dream for $7.99. For some, the concepts are worth its weight in gold for $7.99.
0393324818|5.0|I hate watching baseball.  I was so glad when my kids stopped playing.  So I was surprised to find this book so riveting.  It is a masterpiece of non-fiction writing.  Billy Beane would be a great character to play, although the role needs someone like a young George Clooney, rather than Brad Pitt.  The fact that Billy Beane claimed to be the best athlete in the A's workout room says it all.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|This review also applies to [[ASIN:B002BSHWUU The Beatles Stereo Box Set]].  It took 22 years, but with the newly remastered stereo and mono box sets, The Beatles' music finally gets the treatment it deserves!  Kudos to the EMI Abbey Road team for doing a terrific job with the remastering.  I'll try not to duplicate what others have written, but here is my review of the remasters, based on a disc-by-disc comparison that I did against the original 1987 CDs a couple of months ago:  PLEASE PLEASE ME, WITH THE BEATLES, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, BEATLES FOR SALE:  These first four albums were originally issued as mono CDs back in 1987, though many of the stereo mixes later appeared on the Capitol Albums box sets and other compilations.  Actually, only four songs make their global CD stereo debut here:  &#34;Misery&#34; and &#34;There's a Place&#34; from PLEASE PLEASE ME, and &#34;I Should Have Known Better&#34; and &#34;You Can't Do That&#34; from A HARD DAY'S NIGHT.  George Martin did not want the twin-track mixes of the first two albums issued on CD, and insisted that the mono versions be used; for the second two albums, recorded on 4-track tape, Martin wanted to remix those two for CD, but was informed by EMI that it was too close to the release date deadline, so four mono CDs were released in 1987.  There is not a whole lot of difference between the 1987 and 2009 mono versions, though the new ones are cleaner and less muddy.  The stereo versions, however, blow both mono sets out of the water, as far as I am concerned.  NOTE:  The &#34;fake stereo&#34; versions of &#34;Love Me Do&#34; and &#34;P.S. I Love You,&#34; which were issued on the original stereo vinyl album, were replaced with the standard mono versions on the new PLEASE PLEASE ME CD.  For those who must have the fake stereos, they are available on THE EARLY BEATLES CD, included in THE CAPITOL ALBUMS, VOL. 2 box set. NOTE: The 2014 reissue of THE EARLY BEATLES (available separately, and included in the new THE U.S. ALBUMS box set) has the true mono mixes of the songs, just like the 2009 versions of PLEASE PLEASE ME.  HELP!, RUBBER SOUL:  Because he was not satisfied with the original 1965 stereo mixes, George Martin did remixes of these two albums for their 1987 CD release.  The remastered stereo CDs use these remixes, and while they sound considerably better in 2009, my preference is for the original 1965 stereo mixes, which appear alongside the mono mixes in the mono box set.  The monos are good as well - in fact, they sound better than the 1987 stereo CDs, though not as good as the 2009 stereo versions.  American listeners may find the mono mixes to the soundtrack (first) half of HELP! a little strange-sounding.  This is because the mono version of the Capitol album (available on THE CAPITOL ALBUMS, VOL. 2) is a &#34;fold-down&#34; of the stereo mix - that is, the two channels of the stereo master tape are combined onto one track during the disc-cutting stage. UPDATE: The 2014 reissue of the Capitol HELP! ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK CD has both the original U.K. mono mixes and the 1987 stereo remixes.  REVOLVER:  My favorite Beatle album (next to ABBEY ROAD). Both the mono and stereo versions of the new CDs are far superior to the 1987 stereo version.  Save for &#34;Yellow Submarine&#34; and &#34;Eleanor Rigby,&#34; which have appeared in mono on CD singles, the mono mix of REVOLVER makes its global CD debut in 2009.  It's a shame that American fans were denied the full 14-song version of this album until vinyl imports became available in the late 1970s; three of John Lennon's best numbers (&#34;I'm Only Sleeping,&#34; &#34;Doctor Robert,&#34; and &#34;And Your Bird Can Sing&#34;) were issued on the &#34;YESTERDAY&#34;...AND TODAY album in America, leaving the U.S. version of REVOLVER with just 11 songs. Both of the latter two titles were released on CD in 2014, as part of THE U.S. ALBUMS box set, and as individual CDs.  SGT. PEPPER: A magnificent album, in both stereo and mono, and again far superior to the 1987 CD. Although I generally prefer the stereo release, the mono version has its virtues as well, particularly on &#34;She's Leaving Home,&#34; which is at its original speed on the stereo version, but sped up in mono to make Paul sound younger (per Bruce Spizer). Also, the laughter at the end of &#34;Within You Without You&#34; and Paul's scat vocal at the end of the &#34;Sgt. Pepper&#34; reprise are much louder in mono.  MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR: Because the original six-song double EP (released in CD format in 1992 as part of the COMPACT DISC EP COLLECTION) was not viable in the U.S. market in 1967, Capitol Records added the group's five 1967 single releases to create an 11-song LP, which was ultimately released in the UK in 1976.  The newly remastered stereo CD, like its 1987 predecessor, is based on the 1971 German LP issue, which contained all 11 songs in full glorious stereo.  The original Capitol album had the last 3 tracks in simulated Duophonic stereo, as well as different (earlier) mixes of &#34;I Am the Walrus&#34; and &#34;Strawberry Fields Forever.&#34;  Strangely, when Parlophone issued the album in the UK in the 1970s, the cassette version (Parlophone TC-PCS 3077) used the all-stereo German master, but the vinyl (Parlophone PCTC 255) reverted back to the original Capitol version with the Duophonic mixes.  The remastered stereo CD is the clear winner here.  Although all of the mono mixes have been issued on the EP and SINGLES COLLECTION CD box sets, this is the first time that the actual mono album has been issued since Capitol deleted it in early 1968 (and, according to Beatles historian Bruce Spizer, the surplus mono albums were sent to Brazil, of all places).  THE BEATLES (THE WHITE ALBUM): Of all of the remastered albums, the White Album is the most significantly improved.  The original 1987 CD was flat and lifeless and had three indexing errors:  when the songs &#34;Wild Honey Pie,&#34; &#34;Rocky Raccoon,&#34; and &#34;Cry Baby Cry&#34; were programmed to play by themselves, the intros of the next three songs (respectively, &#34;Bungalow Bill,&#34; &#34;Don't Pass Me By,&#34; and &#34;Revolution 9&#34;) are heard as well.  These errors have been corrected on the new remastered CD, and the entire album sounds fantastic.  The mono version is also quite interesting because it was not originally issued in America, although the mono versions of two songs (&#34;Helter Skelter&#34; and &#34;Don't Pass Me By&#34;) were issued on the Capitol RARITIES album in 1980.  While the mono version is fascinating, the stereo is much better.  YELLOW SUBMARINE:  This is the original soundtrack album, with six Beatle songs on the first half and the seven-song George Martin film score on the second half.  On the original LP, &#34;Only A Northern Song&#34; was mixed only in mono because of technical limitations at the time; a fake stereo version appears on that LP and the original 1987 CD, but the previously unissued mono mix appears on the new CD.  The mono UK release of the YELLOW SUBMARINE album was a &#34;fold-down&#34; version of the stereo.  Although Martin's score sounds magnificent, as does the rest of the remastered CD, listeners who purchase the CDs individually are advised to purchase 1999's YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, which contains 15 remixed versions of the Beatle songs in the film, including the first-ever true stereo mix of the &#34;Only a Northern Song&#34; master.  An alternate stereo take of that song appears on the ANTHOLOGY 2 album from 1996.  ABBEY ROAD: The Beatles' recording swan song (though the next-to-last release, and, if you count the HEY JUDE LP, the third-from-the-last release in America).  My favorite album (George Martin's too), and a magnificent presentation that is leaps and bounds over its 1987 CD predecessor.  One minor beef: at the end of Side One of the vinyl LP, the song &#34;I Want You (She's So Heavy)&#34; has a closing instrumental riff that abruptly cuts off, creating a dramatic effect.  On the original CD, &#34;Here Comes the Sun&#34; begins just a few seconds later and this effect is lost.  On the remastered CD, there is only a one-second break between the tracks.  It's too bad that the engineers didn't add a one-minute band of silence between the two songs, which would have restored the original effect.  LET IT BE:  This is the much-criticized Phil Spector &#34;reproduction&#34; from 1970, and the sound quality of the remaster compares favorably to the 2003 release, LET IT BE...NAKED.  Though NAKED is the better version, the lack of quality is not all &#34;Crazy Phil's&#34; fault; the songs themselves were not up to normal Beatles standards, probably because the group was not getting on well at the time.  Actually, I prefer Phil's mix of the title song.  The group wisely reunited later in the year to record ABBEY ROAD; they obviously wanted to finish out on a positive note, and certainly did.  PAST MASTERS/MONO MASTERS:  Originally issued as two separate CDs (VOLUME ONE and VOLUME TWO) in 1988, the two PAST MASTERS discs have been combined into one set for this remastered CD release.  All 33 of the group's original non-LP tracks are collected here, and four songs that were issued in mono on the 1988 version are in wonderful stereo here - &#34;From Me to You,&#34; &#34;Thank You Girl,&#34; &#34;Komm, Gib Mir Deine Hand,&#34; and &#34;Sie Liebt Dich.&#34;  The sound quality on all of the other tracks is a significant improvement over the earlier version, as well.  Interestingly, &#34;Thank You Girl&#34; appears in its original stereo mix for the first time (at its natural speed and without the echo effects that appeared on THE BEATLES' SECOND ALBUM version).  Disc one of MONO MASTERS (included in the mono box set) has the same tracks as PAST MASTERS, but all in mono; disc two is similar, but replaces &#34;The Ballad of John and Yoko,&#34; &#34;Old Brown Shoe,&#34; and the single version of &#34;Let It Be,&#34; which were only mixed in stereo, with the mono mixes of four songs from the YELLOW SUBMARINE album - &#34;Only A Northern Song&#34; (also found on the remastered YS CD), &#34;All Together Now,&#34; &#34;Hey Bulldog,&#34; and &#34;It's All Too Much&#34; (unique to this compilation).  These mono mixes were intended for a YELLOW SUBMARINE EP that was prepared in March 1969, but never released.  The mono mix of &#34;Across the Universe&#34; originally donated to the World Wildlife Fund, was also intended for that EP; it follows the mono UK single versions of &#34;Get Back&#34; and &#34;Don't Let Me Down&#34; on this CD.  A stereo mix of &#34;Universe&#34; with bird sound effects was prepared for NO ONE'S GONNA CHANGE OUR WORLD, the World Wildlife Fund charity album, in late 1969.  Interestingly, these same bird sound effects (at the beginning and end of this song) are also on the mono version.  NOTE: Because no stereo mixes exist for &#34;Love Me Do (Original Single Version),&#34; &#34;She Loves You,&#34; &#34;I'll Get You,&#34; and &#34;You Know My Name (Look Up The Number),&#34;  those four songs appear in mono on both PAST MASTERS and MONO MASTERS. (Although a reedited and extended stereo mix of &#34;YKMN (LUTN)&#34; was prepared for ANTHOLOGY 2 in 1996, the original has only been issued in mono).  The stereo CDs are packaged in digipaks with expanded booklets with original liner notes and new historical and recording notes.  A modified version of the 1987 SGT. PEPPER booklet is included, as well as the complete MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR booklet.  The YELLOW SUBMARINE booklet has the U.S. Dan Davis liner notes, as well as the U.K. Tony Palmer/Derek Taylor notes.  The mono box set, manufactured in Japan, has the CDs packaged in mini-LP sleeves with resealable outer sleeves, complete with the original inner sleeve LP dust jackets, static-free rice paper sleeves for each CD, and such amenities as the MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR booklet with the Capitol logo, and the SGT. PEPPER cutouts.  Each CD has its proper period label:  the gold-and-black Parlophone label for PLEASE PLEASE ME, yellow-and-black Parlophone labels from WITH THE BEATLES to SGT. PEPPER; the original Capitol rainbow label for MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR; and green Apple labels for the last four albums.  PAST MASTERS and MONO MASTERS have the yellow-and-black Parlophone label on disc 1, and the Apple label on disc 2.  The Mini-Documentaries DVD (included with the stereo box set) has a red Apple label.  The mini-docs (also included as QuickTime files on the individual stereo CDs) don't have a lot of new material, but are a nice touch nonetheless.  If you can only afford one set, get the stereo box, but if you can afford it, get the mono box set too, as well as the Capitol Albums sets, YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK, LET IT BE...NAKED, and LOVE.  As they say in &#34;Mr. Kite,&#34; a splendid time is guaranteed for all.
B0000029LG|5.0|I just got this in the mail and am soooooo happy to finally be able to play it. The first disc is comprised of his number one hits that we all know and love, enough said about that one.   Disc 2 has a huge range of songs from upbeat,pounding songs like Tabloid Junkie, D.S., Scream, that have to do with the media, corrupt legal system,ect that he was dealing with at this time in his life. They are great songs with a good beat and a message, as most of his songs.   Come Together, one of the best Beatles covers ever. His gravelly voice and the strong beat are spectacular! (Don't miss the sexy video on You Tube ladies. WHEW!) Little Susie (strings and choir included)is an amazing song just for the musical ability of the sound and his voice. The messsage however poinient is of course hard to listen to. Pay attention to this message, it is happening in your neighborhood. Iam sure that was his purpose for this song. Don't turn your back on child abuse. Money, History, You Are Not Alone (cry everytime I watch this video), They Don't Care About Us, all amazing strong songs in their own right. Even of you have the songs on the first cd you must get this one for disc 2 and at least to have disc 1 in another place (car, house,ect) to play.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|As the funny, heartfelt and thoroughly oringinal (500) Days of Summer begins, the film's narrator provides the audience with a quick summary of the two main characters and the circumstances that bring them together.  He then provides the following disclaimer, \\"This is a story of boy meets girl, but this is not a love story\\".  That simple statement brilliantly captures the essence of this \\"romantic comedy\\" that tracks the relationship of a young couple in Los Angeles.  The term romantic comedy is accurate in that this movie is a comedy and it is about a romantic relationship, but that's where the similarities end.<br /><br />The plot follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), who meet at the greeting card company where Tom has settled into a fairly safe and routine existence and given up on his dreams of being an architect and finding his soul mate.  But as fate would have it, Summer begins working at the company and Tom knows immediately that they are meant to be together.  As it turns out, fate has different plans.<br /><br />The narrative hook of the movie is that the events are told out of order.  The relationship spans the course of 500 days, but the movie jumps back and forth to various times during the couple's time together.  One minute we are watching them break up, the next we are witnessing their first encounter.  But before you can get comfortable, we're taken to a point in the fim where Tom is planning to get Summer back.  So it goes throughout the movie.  The effect should be one of disorientation, but the film feels surprisingly linear and is easy to follow.  The jumping around allows the audience to see a relationship as a whole; we get the good and the bad and everything in between.  We are not led to believe (as so many romantic comedies tend to do) that once a couple get together, it's smooth sailing.<br /><br />Everything works in this movie.  The performances by Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are pitch perfect, the writing is sharp and funny, the music is cool (thanks, Zooey) and the emotions are very real.  Trust me, this movie hits you hard despite the fact that it actually ends on a positive note that rewards Tom's hopeless romantic nature.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer is a rare film indeed:  an honest \\"relationship\\" movie that never feels like one.  What it does feel like is an immenselgy entertaining, often uproariously funny and deeply moving story about the joys and pains of love.

B0026RHR6K|1.0|It is a pleasure to finally watch a science fiction series that is willing to portray the kind of future world I want.  Here we have all the minorities represented and playing roles of consequence:  the commander is Hispanic, the president is a woman (authoritative, too!), as is our crack fighter pilot (no pun intended); and, heck, you've got no shortage of blacks and Asians bringing up the rear.  Pleasingly, the chief villain is a blonde -- that hussy!<br /><br />My problem, though, is that the series totally lacks an Eskimo!  Although, as we all learn in school, the Inupiat of Alaska's Northwest Arctic have played a significant role in American history, an Eskimo character is nowhere to be seen in this film.  What a pity.  I really wonder how these filmmakers can consider themselves progressive in the face of such a troubling omission.
0470477237|5.0|I was unsure how I might feel about reading a (dead tree) book about social media: it requires engaging in an intrinsically analog process to become better educated about a digital phenomenon. The very idea is pretty counterintuitive on the face of it. Yet here I am leveraging social media to discuss it, thereby bringing it full circle, I suppose.     So my misgivings aside: there are great ideas in this and some credible prognostication about how social media will continue to make its significant impact felt in ways both obvious and subtle. Mr. Qualman certainly supports his statements and conclusions well with plenty of (very recent!) evidence.     Yet a point that he makes fairly consistently but never seems to state explicitly is that in the social media world, advertisers need to become part of the content. The examples are certainly informed by this meme but if it was actually explicitly stated in the text, I must have missed it.     One quibble: I couldn't help being distracted by the consistently (at least 4 that I noticed) incorrect use of the word \\"principal\\" in place of the intended \\"principle\\". However, that is no reflection on Mr. Qualman: his editors at Wiley ought to have caught this. These things sometimes happen and do not distract from the salient and insightful observations made by Mr. Qualman.

1595141715|3.0|Not only should this book NOT be required for school reading parents should seriously read this before allowing any child under 14 to read it.  It is extremely disturbing and innapproriate for anyone that is the slightest bit sensitive.  It contains a rape and a suicide and details other horrific events. I am a very open minded parent and rarely if ever am I sqeemish.  Do yourself a favor as a parent and read it first. It is highly inapproriate for anyone below high school age.  The book jacket is VERY misleading.

B000JML7YC|5.0|I have seen numerous movies of other Jane Austen books, so this was nice to not know the story before reading it. You can tell that she wrote this earlier, becuase it didn't have the same flow that her other books had. The end was very hurried, almost as if it was finished hastily to get it published. Other than that, it was really good and still better than most books I read. I wish there were more Jane Austen books in the world.

0061703257|5.0|95% of the books I read are thrillers and this was the first book of Lehane's I've read. Because I read only thrillers I know the lay out pretty well and can usually guess who they want you to think did 'it'. This book was fast paced and very entertaining and kept me guessing the whole time. By the end I was still guessing and the ending just blew me away! I highly recommend!
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is really the first feature film effort from Studio Ghibli, and while good, it also has its faults. Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a big Miyazaki fan and that I have seen all the films available in the U.S. already and am belatedly reviewing this one (and I've seen it several times already).  Also, there will be spoilers, so be warned.    The story follows Nausicaa, a princess from a kingdom in \\"the Valley of the Wind\\", and is set in a post-apocalyptic world filled with a poisonous forest and giant bugs.  Humans struggle to survive in this harsh world, clinging to pockets of safety far enough away from the poisonous forest to stay alive.  Basically, Nausicaa's home is invaded by the warriors from the kingdom of Tolmekia, who plan to burn the toxic forest down in an attempt to reclaim the land.  Of course, Nausicaa believes they should try to live in peace with the forest and bugs and attempts to stop their plans.  And that's the basic plot right there.    First, let's discuss the good things about this film.  It's very nicely animated.  The forest is fantastically drawn and the creatures that inhabit it are varied and creative in appearance.  It's truly a feast for the eyes.  It's also very entertaining as a fantasy film; there's lots of action to keep the viewer engaged.  The third good point about this film is that the villains are very well developed and have a lot of depth to them.  Because of this, the film can spark a lot of room for discussion, which is always good.    Now, on to the negatives.  The biggest negative here is probably Nausicaa herself.  I've heard other people say she is a bit Mary Sue-ish, and it's true.  You may find yourself hating her by the end of the film.  She's just a little too perfect--she tames wild animals within minutes, she single-handedly learns the secrets of the toxic forest, she's the only one who can seem to keep the giant bugs at bay, she's a princess beloved by all, she loves everyone SO MUCH it sometimes causes her to burst into hysterical fits of tears, and to top it all off, she ends up being the chosen one from myth.  And, she's always right, and she loves all the animals...who normally just kill people except for her, cause she's speshul! Yeah...quite a nice list of accomplishments there, princess.  In other words, she's a Mary Sue.  She has no character flaws whatsoever, and none of her ideas are ever wrong, even when they fly in the face of logic.  The only character flaw she has is that she's just too compassionate and caring (which we all know doesn't count!).  To be fair to Miyazaki, he really improves his techniques in later films, which have much better developed main characters.  In fact, you may find that Kushana, the princess of the Tolmekians, is a more interesting character.  Indeed, she may be a villain but she's far from one-dimensional.  On the one hand, she can be ruthless and cruel, but on the other hand, she's intelligent and even respectable in a way.  She has some very good arguments for why she wants to destroy the forest, even if her methods are misguided.  You also get the feeling that she has a biased hatred of the bugs since she was attacked by one in the past, which ate off most of her limbs (she now has cyborg limbs).  Despite her clear bias (which may have clouded her judgment), you get the feeling that her plan to kill off the murderous bugs might have worked if it had come to fruition.    That brings me to the second negative point with this film.  It's clearly an environmentalist film, which isn't in itself a problem, but here it's a little preachy and heavy-handed.  The viewer is meant to side with Nausicaa and her \\"we should all live in peace with the forest\\" mentality, but I found myself less and less convinced as the movie wears on.  I think the problem is that the villains often bring up very good and valid points which are basically answered with rambling insanity by the \\"good guys\\".  For example, Kushana asks some of the people from the valley of the wind why they want to coexist with the forest when it's clearly killing them.  The toxins basically give them a disease which kills them off earlier than they'd die naturally.  They answer with a rambling speech about how humans can destroy things quickly but it takes the forest several years to grow back.  Umm, not a valid nor on-topic answer guys.  Or how about another scene where the Peyjites (another kingdom which was invaded by the Tolmekians) wish to fight back against the Tolmekians by baiting a bunch of giant bugs into The Valley of the Wind, since they can use them to destroy the Tolmekians positioned there.  Nausicaa objects of course, to which the Peyjites reply, \\"what are we supposed to do, become slaves to the Tolmekians?\\"  Rather than try to point out how unethical it is to destroy her people in the process, our princess just bursts into a hysterical fit of tears and shrieks out \\"so much killing!\\"  Truly she is a wise ruler.  The biggest problem of all is that this film really doesn't make you feel empathetic towards the bugs or the forest despite it's numerous attempts to do so.  I know some people might disagree with me here, but I didn't feel it.  Of course, I'm no tree-hugger, and I feel that given her situation, I'd rather the humans try and go out fighting rather than slowly be killed off by the forest and it's deadly bug inhabitants.      Miyazaki has really improved his film making in terms of good environmentalist films which don't hit you over the head with the message since he made Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.  The cute Totoros (which are tree spirits) in My Neighbor Totoro did more to make me want to save forests than Nausicaa did.  Even the more adult film Princess Mononoke is a better environmentalist piece since it is less one-sided in its portrayals.    Overall, this is a decent film, and definitely worth seeing if you are a fan of Studio Ghibli.  It's even worth owning since it has a lot of good points to it.  As for the current dvd release itself, it's worth owning for the  lengthy \\"history of Studio Ghibli\\" segment in the special features.  It also has a section of interviews with the English voice cast.  None of the other special feature are worth it (just trailers and storyboards), but the history is very interesting.  So anyway, if you're a hard-core fan of Ghibli, go ahead and buy this.  If you're just a casual Ghibli fan, you might want to just rent this one.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|I have seen AVATAR 3D three times, and plan to see it many more. I just cannot get enough of this interesting, something for everyone film.  It has violence, ecological ruination of property, sadness, it is funny in spots and the love story running through it is wonderful.  The scenery is spectacular and to really appreciate it you MUST see it more than one time and you MUST see it in 3D or at least in a theater before you purchase for home use.  Should clean up at Academy Awards time.
0440241901|4.0|THREE QUICK POINTS:<br />* Point 1: Emma Corrigan bears a striking resemblance to Bridget Jones-not necessarily in appearance, but personality, deed and sheer life circumstances.<br /><br />* Point 2: This book redefines the statement laugh out loud funny. From beginning to end, I found myself pausing to have a good belly laugh at some of the antics and situations in which Emma found herself.<br /><br />* Point 3: The British quips and expressions were rather charming from my Americanized viewpoint. Although I'm still not entirely certain what a jumper is and am still unsure whether snogging is kissing or having sex, I found reading through it all added to the amusement.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS:<br />From the onset, it seems that Emma Corrigan's life is on the fast track to nowhere and she just can't catch a break. On a fateful plane ride, when she believes they are all doomed to crash and die, she begins blurting every one of her secrets to the passenger next to her and doesn't stop until they land--still very much alive--and part ways. No big deal until she gets back to work on Monday and finds out the founder of the company, Jack Harper, has scheduled a visit and Jack turns out to be the stranger on the plane--and he remembers everything. As you can imagine, much hilarity ensues as he uses the knowledge gained \\"under duress\\" to keep Emma on her toes. But he does far more than that, he completely changes her life.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />From the very beginning, this book was fraught with unfortunate circumstances, miscommunication, misunderstandings, and illogical decisions which all add to its hilarity.<br /><br />The main character, Emma Corrigan, who narrates the story in a spunky and sometimes bitingly sarcastic way is very sympathetic. More than once, I found myself feeling utterly sorry for her and praying she would get a lucky break or find a secret stash of courage somewhere.<br /><br />Sometimes, however, the novel became predictable. For instance, when Emma wants to impress Jack by taking him to a posh secret nightclub, she ends up forgetting where it is. It wasn't difficult to see that coming from a mile away. But, for the most part, the situations that crop up keeps the reader on her toes as it does Emma.<br /><br />The cast of characters was delightful. Lissy, Emma's priggish, quirky, and smart best friend/roommate, Jemima, Emma and Lissy's selfish gold-digging vixen of a roommate, Connor, Emma's really good looking, but slow on the social uptake boyfriend, and even Emma's co-workers were all well-crafted. The notable exception, however, was Sven who seemed to be Jack's shadow. It's not entirely clear who Sven is or what purpose he serves--he just seems random, placed in the story for no apparent reason.<br /><br />(Confession: Every time Jemima's name came up, I couldn't help imagining Aunt Jemima which made it difficult to connect with her. I finally got over it by mentally renaming her Gemma. She still had no redeeming qualities and frankly, I wondered why Emma and Lissy even put up with her.)<br /><br />Although the storyline is farfetched-meeting the founder of the company where you work on a flight and blurting out every single one of your secrets to him and then later falling madly in love with him?-it's a smooth and entertaining read. All the pieces, except Jack's big secret which, quite frankly, made me roll my eyes, fit together well.<br /><br />If you enjoyed the movies 'How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days', 'The Holiday', 'Bridget Jones' Diary', and 'Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason', then there's a 99.9% chance you'll enjoy 'Can You Keep a Secret?'.cret nightclub, she ends up forgetting where it is.

0767821629|5.0|This movie was right along the lines of what I was looking for. Lately I've been quite into the Neo Noir and Tech Noir genres. What I had hoped for in [[ASIN:B00000K31V eXistenZ]], but been disappointed, was realized quite smartly in [[ASIN:0767821629 The Thirteenth Floor]].<br /><br />There's just enough technology used in the movie that it could potentially be considered \\"tech noir,\\" but moreover it falls squarely into the category of \\"neo noir,\\" playing with notions of identity, sanity, what defines 'humanity' or the 'soul' in a world of increasingly complex computer simulations made in our image.<br /><br />I won't give away any of the plot twists and turns. I'll simply say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I liked the style of the movie and some of the themes presented. I was relatively surprised by the ending twists, though I caught the gist based on a hint they placed just before the explicit expository sequence where it's all explained in some length.<br /><br />I give it an A+. I don't think it's quite fair to classify it alongside The Matrix, as they really are quite different movies. Though they do share a few themes, certainly (virtual worlds, identity, etc.). This is less an actioner than it is a stylized neo noir-ish mystery.
0380807343|5.0|THREE QUICK POINTS:<br />* Point 1: This book is absolutely riveting. Who knew I'd ever use the term riveting to describe a short novel penned for third-graders?<br /><br />* Point 2: I'm sure some children will wind up with nightmares after reading it (or having it read to them). I can't deny that I'm a huge fan of horror and creepy stories; my library as a youth (and even today) tells this tale. But, reading Coraline definitely sent a few chills up my spine...more so than some of the adult novels I've read.<br /><br />* Point 3: Coraline is a splendid reminder that we (children and adults alike) are all capable of great courage. Coraline has a real child's personality-not some fantasized version of one-which made her courageous adventures incredibly relatable. I was able to see much of myself, when I was a child, in her and watching her dig deep to find her courage made me want to dig deep and rediscover my own.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS:<br />A young lady named Coraline (not Caroline. Coraline) Jones, having just moved into a new flat with her parents, found herself embarking on a frightening and exciting adventure.  Since her parents were usually preoccupied, Coraline took it upon herself to explore the new house and its grounds. One afternoon, however, it's pouring down rain, so she cannot go and explore outside and she is bored. Her father suggests that she explore her flat and that's when Coraline finds a locked door. She manages to get the key and open it up. Inside she discovers a dark corridor. Curiosity struck and she soon found herself in a room that looked very much like her own--furniture and all. In that world, she discovered that she had an \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father\\". In fact, that world--at first sight--seemed much more interesting and fun than her real world. But, Coraline soon learned that things weren't as they appeared in that other world.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />It would be quite easy to finish Coraline in a single sitting and not necessarily because of its short length, but because the story pushes you forward. You constantly want to know which new adventure she'll discover, which new creature will jump from the shadows, and how she'll get herself out of the nightmare she's in.<br /><br />Although this book doesn't get deeply into gory details (there are a few droplets of blood, but nothing worse than a child would see if she were to watch a stray cat hunting a mouse or bird in the field), it's certainly creepy enough to make you want to put the lights on if you're reading it in the dark.<br /><br />The book built suspense...<br /><br />\\"[The other mother] picked Coraline up and pushed her into the dim space behind the mirror. A fragment of beetle was sticking to her lower lip, and there was no expression at all in her black button eyes.<br /><br />Then she swung the mirror door closed, and left Coraline in darkness.\\"<br /><br />...and deposited paranoid thoughts in the corner of your mind (was that a shadow I just saw crawling along the wainscoting? or I could have sworn something just moved behind the chair.). Not only that, it showed the reader that all of the frightful creatures and circumstances could be handled effectively with some measure of wit and courage.<br /><br />This story was masterfully told with subtle undertones. For instance, Gaiman never tells us explicitly what creature Coraline is facing, but it's alluded to. (Hint: Pay attention to the cat's narration.)  Coraline's mother and father, Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, the crazy old man that lives upstairs (he does have a name, but I don't want to spoil the story by giving it away), the black cat, and Coraline herself are all crafted with care. They each display distinct, unique, and sometimes fanciful, but believable personalities.<br /><br />Although there were illustrations throughout, they didn't all speak to me. For the most part, they did add to the chilling effect of the story, but a few seemed misplaced. Frankly, thestory would have been just as good without the illustrations, but they were a nice touch--especially for younger readers.<br /><br />It's my belief that Coraline is the type of book that could get more kids involved with reading. It appeals to their curious spirit, wild imagination, and it delivers the message that the things that go bump in the night can be conquered.<br /><br />\\"Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.\\" -G. K. Chestertonally for younger readers.    It's my belief that Coraline is the type of book that could get more kids involved with reading.

0385504225|2.0|See Jason Lee's review. It was spot on, especially where he details the charactor exchanges. This book was 500 pages of Langdon the skeptic and claustrophobic, being told/shown \\"truths\\" by a handful on uninteresting charactors. I appreciated the science element in Angels & Demons, and the historical element to Da Vinci Code, but this merger of the two just seemed a like an unneccesary and poorly told revisit to old themes. Dan Brown even throws in a few \\"memories\\" of past novels' exploits. There were so many times I wanted to put down the book for good and just it give up, but since I really liked Dan Brown's other novels I felt like I should at least see it through--what if it really all came together in the end?? For me, it did not. Yes, he tied up all of his plot but not enough to save this mess of Christian/Masonic/Historical fiction. Maybe this genre is just overdone at this point? When it comes to Dan Brown I'm not looking for a great literary masterpiece, but this seemed more like an English Comp 101 student's attempt to break into the bestseller market. \\"And then we went here. And then we went there. And then there was a twist!! And a new charactor! And a breakthrough! And then we ran here! Which led us to there!\\" Five. Hundred. Pages. One Hundred and Thirty-three Chapters. Of THAT. And honestly, most of it could easily have been deleted.<br /><br />About halfway through I had the following thoughts:<br /><br />1) In this economy, they inflated the text so that people would feel more comfortable dropping $20-$30 on the hardcover. After all, spending that much on a 200-pg piece of fiction that lasts two days doesn't add up quite like dropping the same amount on a 500 pg book that should take up a week. Unfortunately, most of the chapters are only 2-5 pages, sometimes with the last page being almost entirely blank. As a graphic designer I appreciate white space, but I literally couldn't get past the thought that half the content was superfluous and could have been removed without any harm to the story.<br /><br />2) This seemed like some of his research from Angels & Demons and some of his research from Da Vinci Code merged together to make a \\"new\\" story. Unfortunately, he took some of the things I hated from each and really ran with them (Crazed albino monk? Meet Mal'akh. Pseudoscience meets historical fiction? Atomic research, meet Noetic science. And then there are the charactors who aren't what they seem...) Same story, different time/place/charactors.<br /><br />3) Did any one else notice that the love interests in the previous books disappear with no note of where they went? Apparently an award-winning and adventurous scientist wasn't good enough for Langdon, nor was a beautiful and direct descendant of Jesus Christ??<br /><br />4) Seems like Brown was trying to \\"humanize\\" Langdon by introducing his weaknesses and faults. However, I found him a little trying in this one.  Don't even get me started on some of the other charactors. There were a few I thought were downright crazed. And I'm not just talking about the villain.<br /><br />5) If you're reading this on the train, or metro, and you can only do a little bit at a time, you're in luck. The story jumps around every 2 pages or so to a different place/charactor. But not to worry, because when you encounter that charactor again in 5 pages, Brown will restate where you left off. If you are reading straight through during a long stretch, it's repetitive.<br /><br />If you're using this as an airport-read/commute-read to toss in your briefcase, or as a beach-read when out with friends, or as a few pages a frantic mom manages to get to herself sporadically, then this could be great. That's why I'm giving it two stars, because it serves it's purpose as a time passer and stress releaser. Just make sure you check it out from the library or pick it up used for $4.

B002QH2NUA|3.0|Yet another installment in the Paul McCartney live album catalog.  Being a big Beatles and solo fabs fan, I did see the 3rd of his Citi Field concerts in July 2009 (my 2nd PM concert) and it was a great show, if not as great as Oct 2005 @ Madison Square Garden (never quite the same as the first time).  But now having heard this, McCartney's 7th, 8th or whatever he's up to in count of live albums and videos, a few things I want to say about 'Good Evening New York City' ...     * His band (Rusty, Abe, Brian and Wix) are in fine form as always.  Those four musicians should be a band unto themselves with a different lead singer and bassist someday (Sting? Roger Waters? Jack Bruce?) since they have earned their wings (pun was definitely intended!) and I would like to hear what they as a band can do outside of being McCartney's sidemen.    * Paul McCartney is now 67 years of age - it is truly amazing that at that stage of life, he can still go out on tours, rock out, and entertain thousands of people who will forever adore him for his Beatles and solo musical contributions to the world.  But his singing voice is diminishing as time goes on -- hear the difference between his singing on 'Back in the U.S.' from 2002 and GENYC, seven years later.  Or go back to 'Driving Rain' then hear his vocals on the next studio albums 'Chaos & Creation ITBY' ... 'Memory Almost Full' .. then the Firemen 'Electric Arguements' and the song \\"I Want to Go Home\\" from the 'Everybody's Fine' film.  See the David Letterman performance from July 2009 -- the Radio City Music Hall performance with Ringo on 'LIttle Help from my Friends' ... and most recently, his vocals on the Ringo Starr \\"Walk With You\\" track that just came out on the 'Y Not' album.  Sad, but true, McCartney's singing is getting harder to listen to (new product that is). Maybe there are die-hard fans who like his current voice and no matter what he does, will support him and buy any and every McCartney (and Beatles) related recordingthat comes out, uncritical and not wavering from their absolute devotion and almost disciple-like relationship to their magical musical master.    * Far from the days of Wings, where on 'Wings Over America' he gave us six Beatles songs -- on GENYC, all but one track on disc 2 are Beatles numbers, as there also several on disc 1.  Don't get me wrong, I'm like many McCartney fans where no matter how much I like his solo work, still prefer the Beatles.  But at this point, McCartney's solo career is 40 years and going strong -- he could rightfully perform more of his Wings and solo songs, less Beatles, and fans probably would not ask for their money back.  The solo material he plays is mostly from 'Band on the Run' era -- no doubt among the best solo PM (with \\"Mrs Vandebilt\\", he has now put out live recordings of every song from side 1 of 'Band on the Run', just a bit of trivia for you Wings fans - with yet another 'Let me Roll It' here) but he overlooks a ton of other songs that would work well live -- \\"Junior's Farm\\", anything from 'Back to the Egg' for starts) -- so GENYC more than any previous McCartney live album is a gift to the Beatles fans who, when all is said and done, want McCartney to be a permanent Beatles nostalgia machine -- and hearing him at Citi Field with his band churning out \\"Paperback Writer\\", \\"Back in the USSR\\", \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Drive My Car\\", \\"Hey Jude' and so on, that is indeed what most of us really want.  For time to stand still, for Beatles music to waft in our ears and in our eyes, forever keeping us young at heart, with fond memories of John, Paul, George & Ringo as young lads whose music time never dulls and our ears never stop wanting to hear.      If you want a better overall performance heavy on the Beatles and of recent vintage, get 'Back in the US' or the DVD of 'The Space Between US' (which has a killer one-two punch of \\"Two Many People/She Came in Through the Bathroom Window\\" -- which at least digs deeper into his catalog beyond the very obvious \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Let it Be\\").  But if you are completist, a true die-hard McCartney/Beatles fan, then by all means get GENYC and you will enjoy it very much.    I am hoping his next live album (no doubt he's not done with them) will delve deeper into his vast catalog of song ... or, here's a radical idea for Paul McCartney ... perform a tribute to John and George show (with Ringo) and do Beatles songs written by them .. since Paul has done \\"Something\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\", and also \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"A Day in the Life\\", why not also try \\"Here Comes the Sun\\", \\"In My Life\\", \\"A Hard Day's Night\\", \\"Taxman\\" and many others his fellow fabs who are not \\"Here Today\\" he might do justice to the songs of Lennon and Harrison ... he already put his foot in the water, now Paul, I say dive in and try your hand at singing \\"Imagine\\" in front of a crowd -- bet people who love to see that.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I've read the book and had no problem being sucked into the story.  And he has a knack for giving us information through conflict.  The teacher has to win over the students, the mentor has to convince the hero, etc.  He also makes the novel feel important.  For those reason, we should credit Dan Brown - he does a lot of things right.  Obviously - he's selling millions of books.  I will probably read his next one. This one was a good way to break in my Kindle - I knew I'd be able to read it no matter what screen it was on.    But he does a few things wrong.  At times he's so melodramatic, especially the bad guys thoughts. The characters are so black and white. He uses a similar twist (that I saw coming a mile away) that he used in Angels and Demons.  His writing is full of redundancies that need to be cut.  And for the love of God, stop the preaching.  The final 10% of the book is completely unnecessary.  That 50 plus pages of trying to convince Langdon to be a Bible follower because the Bible is written in code - only Langdon doesn't change his mind.  It just ends.    Still, I enjoyed it and at times couldn't stop reading.  It was fun.

It might be clich&eacute;, but the first recipe I tried was the Beouf Bourguignon. After a few hours of preparation and following the directions religiously, I tasted it and couldn't believe my taste buds, I had actually concocted a beautiful and superbly delicious French dish that tasted French! Julia Child is a gastronomical saint! I highly recommend buying this book.
B0008JIJ2E|4.0|This is a loose present day adaption based upon a life experience of Jesus Christ. Ralph Macchio plays the lead supported by Pat Morita and the charismatic William Zabka. This was overall a decent movie. I, however, found the film to be abstruse in certain areas and more often than not straying far from it's Biblical origin. Fans of the Bible story may not care for this movie. I took it for what it was including its flaws and enjoyed it.
1594488843|1.0|Maslow's 'hierarchy of needs' covered this topic very well, decades ago. Start with physiological (eg. food) needs (paramount now, unfortunately, in Haiti, followed by safety (personal, financial), social (friendship), and then self-actualization (eg. at Google). Maslow said it better, sooner, and with much better documentation. Read Maslow instead of Pink.
B0002EXH5E|3.0|Risk is when Megadeth reach the lowest point of their career. Ever since Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings they toned their sound down to a more rock genre than metal. While their last 2 were a bit more progressive, Risk is more industrial and electronic. A lot of them are lighter and more experimental but there's some heavier tracks also. Not that every Megadeth song should have to be heavy metal, A Toute Le Monde and I'll Get Even were great songs and were far from metal.<br /><br />Insomnia 6/10: Decent opening track, album starts off good. Experimental but still has some hard rock in it.<br />Prince Of Darkness 6/10: Good heavier track, into is lame though.<br />Enter The Arena 4/10: Just a short instrumental, not really that good but not terrible.<br />Crush 'em 8/10: Awesome track, a good hard rocker and very catchy.<br />Breadline 2/10: Don't care for this one, weird experimental track and very pop oriented sound.<br />The Doctor's Calling: 8/10 Really like this one, has a very dark and heavy sound.<br />I'll Be There: 2/10: Back to the experimental pop oriented sound, bad track that's not worth listening to.<br />Wanderlust: 9/10: My absolute favorite from Risk, the verses are very different sounding along with an awesome chorus.<br />Ecstasy: 5.5/10: The best of the pop oriented tracks, not a bad song unlike the others.<br />Seven: 8/10: Great track and faster paced that the other heavy tracks, one of the best off Risk.<br />Time The Beggining/The End 5.5/10: Decent first part, 2nd isn't too bad and a little better. Beginning is a ballad and the second is hard rock, great way to wrap up the end of an album.
B00164GDD2|1.0|Seriously, the quality is awful.  The picture is grainy.  Really grainy.  Almost unwatchably grainy.  Unless you have a player that will allow you to soften the picture... a lot... then just buy the DVD.  And someone remind me to change my settings back to normal so other movies will still have outlines.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This version of Emma is definitely my new fav.  Romola Garai is great as Emma Wodehouse, a spoiled, conceited, even at times manipulative wanna-be matchmaker but she still manages to be pretty darn likeable.  I also liked that this version took the time to examine the lives of the other characters a bit more deeply.  Of course, in true BBC style, the sets are lavish, the costumes are gorgeous, and every actor tailor made for their parts.  Very well done!!

B001GCUO4S|3.0|I have enjoyed the Final Destination movies.  They aren't great horrors or even great movies, but they always entertained me.  By the 4th movie, the formula is getting a little stale.  Really the only thing to watch this one for is to see the creative ways of killing people.  I didn't see it in 3D, but I don't think it would have made much of a difference.  The 3D seems more like a gimmick to get people to still watch the series.  If you are a fan of the first 3, then this is more of the same.  It was a decent rental, but I won't be purchasing this movie.
0805091742|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Dr. Atul Gawande ever since meeting him at a patient safety conference in 2005, and then subsequently reading his books and following his New Yorker articles.  Perhaps because I've been following his works closely or maybe because I'm a practicing doctor diligently making the healthcare system better is why I didn't find his latest work the most compelling.<br /><br />Dr. Gawande makes two points, checklists and clear communications among teams, are absolutely required to decrease errors and problems and increase the chances of absolutely the best outcome, whether in constructing buildings, flying airplanes, and performing surgery.  We aren't perfect.  Systematic approaches make us better.<br /><br />Only the last two chapters, \\"The Hero in the Age of Checklists\\" and \\"The Save\\", which highlight the \\"Miracle on the Hudson\\" landing of US Airways flight 1549 by Captain Sullenberger and his crew and Dr. Gawande's experience in the operating room of adverting a near catastrophe respectively, were the most gripping.<br /><br />Ultimately, despite his points the irony will be that the healthcare system will not adopt these ideas, which are accepted as expectations in the aviation industry, because doctors still feel that we are somehow smarter or above checklists or teamwork.  This failure to do what we are truly capable of is disheartening.  As a result, individual patients will be the ones responsible in taking care of their health and asking questions.  A good easy to read book or \\"checklist\\" in ensuring you get the right care every time is at [[ASIN:0979351200 Stay Healthy, Live Longer, Spend Wisely: Making Intelligent Choices in America's Healthcare System]].<br /><br />Although I wasn't bowled over like his other works, nevertheless, I have my own checklist and that is to continue reading and learning from Dr. Gawande and many others who toil in making healthcare better and safer.

I love this DVD, but as most things, nothing is perfect:  What I liked:  + 20 min workout, as they fit into my busy days  + combines weights, cardio & abs so I feel it's very balanced  + no-nonsence instructor style: no silly music or funny outfits: focus is on the exercise  + most exercises have a lower-impact/easier option and a higher-impact/harder option  + no equipment necessary (other than maybe a mat, if you're not doing it on a carpet and some weights, but depending on your fitness, cans do the trick, too)  + good comentary on explaining the exercises, but also motivation to keep you going.   What could be better:  - no explanation if or why these workouts can or should be done every single day without giving the body a day of rest in between  - no explanation as to when one should move on from the level 1 or 2 to level 3 - \\"when you're ready\\" does not imply that you can mix it up for diversity, or if you need to keep doing the same for 10 days before \\"upgrading\\"
B002JCSWV6|4.0|So-so in Soweto<br /><br />\\"Invictus\\" tells the story of how newly-installed South African president Nelson Mandela sought racial peace in his country be reaching out to the national rugby team, beloved of whites. The film is utterly inspirational and often quite moving. Morgan Freeman plays Mandela with dignity and intelligence; Matt Damon plays rugby captain Francois Pienaar with tightly-wound intensity. Having travelled to South Africa, my wife and I were thrilled to see some of the sights around Cape Town. Robben Island, Table Mountain and even the Ferryman's Tavern were prominently featured in the film. Two prominent South African musical groups -- Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Soweto String Quartet, were given roles.<br /><br />But the film itself had a lassitude that took away from its intense subject. Though it was set only a year or to after decades of brutal white minority rule, the film's emotions were muted. For those who don't know much about South Africa, little historical context was provided. And certain symbolic story arcs -- for instance the stance of the rugby team toward the new Xhosa national anthem -- were raised, and then dropped without development. Pienaar himself was an enigma. As a beneficiary of the old system, one might have expected to see him struggle with the demands of being ruled by those once considered terrorists. But none of this was developed.<br /><br />As an inspirational film about how leaders must sometimes buck popular wisdom to lead people to a wider vision, Invictus is incomparable. As a means by which the story of South Africa can be introduced to an American audience, it is adequate,. But as a film, it lacks energy and character. The last quarter of the film, devolving into the clich&eacute;d \\"underdog in the championship,\\" was especially disappointing. This three star movie gets four from me, but only for old times sake.

B002MW50KO|1.0|What business does Bob Dylan have in putting out a Christmas album? None, evidently. This CD is bad on so many levels. The white bread arrangements would not be out of place on a Pat Boone record. Dylan doesn't even try to give the tunes any interesting treatment, but sings them straight. His unique voice is not strong enough or interesting enough to carry the numbers. And the selections -- \\"Here Come Santa Claus,\\" \\"Up on a Housetop\\" and their ilk -- sound oh so wrong coming out of this folk and rock legend's mouth.<br /><br />I rarely give any product 1 star. But I couldn't bear even listening to this monstrosity's cuts all the way through. 30 seconds, and I was pumping the fast-forward button as fast is I would go. The only reasonable explanation for this horror is that Dylan lost a bet and had to produce the hokiest Christmas album ever devised. Terrible, horrible and no good at all. Avoid!!!
B00275EGX8|4.0|OK, so granted he isn't the star but still, if you're going to have him in your movie, give him some screen time. More than half the movie could have been spent of Fiennes. He could have been making phone calls, playing X-Box, drinking a bottle of Jack, brushing his teeth, staring aimlessly out a window, running through Bagdad,shooting people standing around who happen to be holding cellys, doing the laundry for his freinds, getting busy with Israeli chicks, singing 'God Save the Queen' while staring aimlessly out said window, thinking up hilarious 'George Clooney' style pranks to play on the clueless locals, playing soccer and creating lasting friendships with young Iraqi boys selling pirated DVD's... I'm just saying, if you got Ralph Fiennes, YOU GOT RALPH FIENNES. Use him.
0553266306|1.0|I started The Day of the Jackal with high hopes, and I was just making my way through the first chapter, trying to sort out the characters, when I came across this information:  On August 22, 1961, dusk had fallen at 8:10 pm, but on August 22, 1962, dusk fell at 8:35 pm.  Those 25 minutes were to change the history of France.\\"  Maybe some physicist or astronomer out there can correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't that impossible?  On the same day of the year, in the same location, wouldn't dusk fall within a few seconds of the time it fell the year previously?  Since the failure of the assassination plot depended on this fact, and since I'm not normally interested in plots and chases and assassination attempts, I stopped reading the book.
1401923119|4.0|I'll make this review short and sweet.    This book will entertain and amaze you with the stories of what is possible and how science is beginning to discover (or at least theorize) what's behind this \\"magic.\\" But it won't tell you how to participate in these miracles. So it may leave you feeling like you are watching the Superbowl from outside the stadium gate with no ticket to get in.    But the hope and wonder you get from reading it is definitely worth the price. I recommend it.    I was hoping his next book, Spontaneous Evolution, would dive into whole \\"what you can do to change your life\\" part of it, but based on the description, it doesn't look like it.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Yo, Adrian! Finally we're on a blu-ray collection! I always wanted to upgrade my dvd collection to the blu-ray set. I was also happy to actually finally get Rocky Balboa, it was the only Rocky movie I didn't have yet. I was waiting for the blu-ray collection. I got a really great deal too, and highly recommend to people who haven't seen rocky, for anyone wanting to upgrade to blu-ray. Blu-ray experience knocks it out of the ring, TKO! Best visual experience you can ever have.
0810983915|4.0|Written by my teenaged son, approved by me:<br /><br />The first three \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books were great fun to read. They weren't too sad, but not too bright and cheerful, either.  They were a brilliant satire on modern suburban life, and coupled with a multitude of whacky situations, they were an instant hit. But this book doesn't fit the mold. Especially not after it seriously damaged the hopes and dreams of everyone who was looking forward to it... me included.<br /><br />Story: 8/10 - Unlike other books in this series, which at least had some bright spots for our hero, and were exceptionally funny, this is not - its story, which is about Greg's summer vacation, does not favor our hero in the least, and puts him through trial after trial while crushing his spirit, his friendships, and his love life; Trista's rejection was almost brutal!<br /><br />Humor: 8/10 - This book mostly favors a heavy dose of schadenfreude, plenty of physical humor, and a hint of irony, whereas most other books in the series favored some schadenfreude, some irony, and some physical humor, not throwing the balance out of whack for any of them. Especially sad is the number of deaths in the book - and they aren't even funny.<br /><br />Characters: 8/10 - This book barely introduces any new characters, and downplays the roles of many significant ones (Holly is practically nonexistant, and Fregley barely appears at all). Instead, it focuses on dumping everything on the one main hero, Greg, which is sad, because he could have used some more friends.<br /><br />Entertainment: 8/10 - This book will, admittedly, make you want to read it over and over again, but it still lacks things which made the other books great. Shame, really.<br /><br />Overall: 32/40 - This review, frankly, would have been much higher if the author had increased Trista's role, had Rodrick go on a band tour, and added in some bright spots for Greg instead of making him even more miserable. But it didn't, and that's that.
0385341008|5.0|This book is for anyone who enjoys a light-hearted yarn or a deeper, moving historical fiction. The characters in this book are rich and complex, with humor and compassion. I found myself wishing I could go and visit them all!!! The jounral-entry style of the chapters was choppy at first, but as the story develops, it flows smoothly and evolves just as naturally as if you were living in Guernsey. Hooray to the author and her amazing niece who saw this book through publication. I am truly deepply saddened that I cannot accompany Ms Shaffer on other adventures!
B002ZG997M|4.0|The post-apocalypse sub-genre of science fiction has always been a place I like to go.  I'll give movies of this type some slack I wouldn't always give other kinds, so that even a relatively weak post-apoc flick like Doomsday (in which Malcolm McDowell appeared, as he does here) still has its interesting moments. But if it's a good one such as I Am Legend, I'm really into it bigtime.  So I've been eagerly anticipating The Book of Eli from the time the first trailers appeared, and now that I've seen it there were many things about it I liked.  Start with the mythic prophet main character.  His super-heroic weapons skills showed there was something unique about him early on.  Those scenes were generally pretty cool, and they were spread out pretty well over the length of the film.  (Any more fight scenes would have bored me.)  Eli's story plays out with a kind of grim determinism, although it also has hopeful elements as well.  I was glad I wasn't previously familiar with the story, as the major revelations about the Book in the final act were a complete surprise.  Mr. Washington was an excellent choice for the lead.  Other roles were well cast too, including (to my surprise) Jennifer Beals as the blind mistress of Gary Oldman's bad boss character.  Oldman himself struck just the right notes of ego, madness & desperation.  Anyway, as far as the post-apoc nature of the movie, it provides fascinating glimpses of which possessions would be really valuable in such a world (ex., chapstick yes; cigarette lighter, not so much), and other aspects of survival felt very authentic throughout the film.  All in all, it wasn't quite the adventure I was expecting (with occasional pacing issues), but I still found it to be an enjoyable viewing experience.
0316001821|5.0|[[ASIN:1439217041 My Husband Ran Off with the Nanny and God Do I Miss Her]] I read this book a few years ago and it it will never leave me. It is one of those books you can't put down - I read it in one night and so did my daughter. It is a daunting task to write a story from the viewpoint of a !$ year old girl who has been murdered and therefore is telling the tale ss someone who is dead, but the author does this so beautifully, that it is almost hard to digest. In one way, it is like getting a glimpse into what heaven really would be like. The reader is also reeling in the horrendous way this little girl was murdered> You can feel the effect her death has on her family so realistically it hurts deep inside. And while the reader is caught up in the fascination that I believe all humans feel about death, the story really is a compelling, page-turner detective story, Is really amazing and beautifully written. I had a very good friend who was murdered at age 14, so perhaps I am not the best judge. Somehow it gave me comfort. maybe there is a heaven after all.  Sincerely, Tracy Davis  I am an author of a much lighter, humorous but still a bit sad novel that is based on my true story and is available exclusively on Amazon.com called \\"My Husband Ran Off With the Nanny and God Do I Miss Her.\\" I have to add humor to my writing in order to tolerate it. I could never write a novel like My Lovely Bones. Yet the novel is not depressing - it is fascinating and I think it s one of the best books I have ever read, in its own unique way!
B001A50716|3.0|This 0 Region version of \\"Arizona Dream\\" offers a crystal clear picture and Dolby Sound.  The viewer can choose English or Chinese subtitles, but they do not appear unless the option is selected.    The film itself is very off-the-beaten path.  Akin to \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" in that Depp's character is the one telling the story throughout.      By far the highlight of the film is Jerry Lewis.  The stellar comedian-actor-director-producer plays part himself, part a classic Paramount character, and part Jerry Langford (from \\"The King of Comedy\\").  The film is worth a gander even if you simply Fast Forward to his parts.    \\"Arizona Dream\\" is like a piece of art and open to a wide range of viewpoints.  For example, who is dreaming?  Axel and his Uncle Leo (Lewis) or their Inuit counterparts?
044656740X|1.0|This book is inmoral, but it is not exactly wrong.  You can make money by having property and leasing it to others.  Instead of reading this motivational speech, however, you should take a copy of Marx's Das Kapital and read it.  There you have, having other people work for you, producing surplus-value, will make you rich.  Voila.  It is called capitalism, you know.
0142437611|4.0|In the story Looking for Mr. Green, in my edition of Seize the Day, a minor character summarizes the mood of this entire work.  In Seize the Day, we can find the Ur-Bellow concerns; most of the themes that can be found in his later literature, somewhat more fleshed out, are found here.      Overwhelmingly, this is the place of money, power and position in American life.  Some later Bellow work appears to reveal in American prosperity and materialism.  He is adept at explaining in detail the quality and price of a jacket or tie or a sports car.  But in Seize the Day, Americam capitalism runs over the main character, at the end reducing him to literal tears.      If anyone wants to see the early Bellow flexing his new literary muscles, this work must be read.
B002OFWG7O|4.0|This is great value for your money.  Includes the most POPULAR tunes, although I'm sure Grohl and company think that several other tracks in their catalog are better (He even hints about that in the liner notes).    My main beef is the fact that the original video for Breakout wasn't included.  While the live version from Hyde Park is incredibly good footage, the original video was one of the band's best and featured the Foos at their comical best in my opinion (Remember the night at the drive in theater?  Hilarious stuff).    The new track Wheels sounds great, influenced heavily by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, almost sounding like a mashup of Learning to Fly (Petty's song) and Mary Jane's Last Dance.     The Foo Fighters have had a great run so far and this collection will please the most hard-core to casual fan.  Great job guys, let's hope the next 15 years are as good or better!!
B00275EGX8|5.0|I remember when Platoon came out. My best friend's dad was first cavalry and spent 6 years - yes SIX YEARS in Viet Nam. He said it was pure crap and hated it. He did love Full Metal Jacket, especially boot camp in the first half. I think Hurt Locker falls into the same catagory and will likely win awards like Platoon. This is a GREAT MOVIE. The characters are amazing, the acting is even better and the sense of tension is unbearable because you feel like someone is going to die in virtually every scene. The Hurt Locker is not accurate. There are a lot of incensed reviews from soldiers, a personal friend of mine (an EOD Tech) didn't make through the first 45 minutes and dismissed it as crap. Because Iraq has been a part of most of our lives for the last 9 years, it still hits close to the heart and I think that watching a movie that is essentially \\"entertainment\\" can be difficult when you have friends or loved ones still there.     There are three protagonists, and each represents a \\"soldier stereotype\\". There's the reckless cowboy, soldier doing his duty and the guy who just wants to make it out alive. Reckless cowboy (Jeremy Renner - future acadamy award winner), takes over a squad and the film moves from point to point with different scenerios. There is no real villian, just the environment that they are in. That is part of the greatness of the film. Although it is pretty much all hollywood, The Hurt Locker does an outstanding job of conveying the sense of pressure that soldiers continually have through tension filled scenes that escalate in severity as the film progresses. Those that pan the movie becuase of how far fetched each scene is fail to realize that a film about a night patrol where nothing happens will not be seen by anyone. The tension IS there only of you are a boots on the ground soldier. The Hurt Locker does an amazing job of giving regular people a glimpse of that pressure.     As a film, the quality is simply undeniable. As a BluRay disk, the quality is solid, although not amazing. Being an independent film that didn't make a lot of money or go wide release, this isn't a suprise. I would say from a BluRay disk standpoint, it is middle of the pack. Being a newer film, it still surpasses most movies on BluRay that were released in the early part of the decade, but is no where near the quality of a film like District 9 or Inglorious Basterds. The film is grainy throughout, but that was the way it was made. There are no extras other than a commentary track and on set profile. It would have been nice to see a mini documentary about some realy life EOD Techs or more information about the technology, procedure, training for the film, etc. If it wins enough awards, I would fully expect a second edition that is a Director's Cut or Special Edition with some of these features. As has been the case for MY Blu Ray purchases, I would crush Hurt Locker and drop 1 star on it for the Blu Ray beacuse there really is nothing here. But the movie is just SO GREAT, that I still will give it 5 stars based on the quality alone.     This was my favorite movie of the year. The drama, tension and performances are incredible. The Hurt Locker has already started racking up award wins and deservedly so.
B000NIWI9K|3.0|On the plus side beautifully sung and acted throughout by the four lovers especially the superlative Miah Persson, and fine orchestral work at least after a very blatant overpowering heavy-handed Act One overture, yet so much on the minus side too:  a non-starter as Don Alfonso (this wasn't a philosopher but a petulant angry man with no explanation as to why) and despite her attractive demeanor a weak Despina who made nothing of her extra roles either as the Doctor or the Notary;  inadequate staging with so much action stuck behind furniture and a totally bland handling of the chorus (no sense of who, what, or why with lumpen characterless mass entrances and exits);  poor costume choices for Don Alfonso, Despina and Dorabella, and why does Despina as a maid have almost exactly the same hairstyle as her two mistresses?;  however my biggest quarrel is with the dreadful camerawork, most unusual for a production from Glyndebourne - it seems that the director had no idea of what was coming next, often missing a singer's key vocal line by focussing on the wrong person at the wrong time and regularly failing to include all the singers when a quartet or sextet was being sung    for the four lovers alone it is worth watching once but it won't find a place in my collection - for my money the Ponnelle/Harnoncourt film or the Peter Sellars \\"diner\\" production offer so much more visually and as a whole:  a great shame, the handsome talented lovers deserved so much more
B002VPE1AM|5.0|this flick is so mesmerizingly beautiful it is a spiritual experience.  SEE this flick!  you shall leave the cinema a changed person.  realize that what is portrayed on the screen is actually happening to our beloved home-world on a daily basis:  weep for gaia and then DO soemthing!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|There are so many eloquent reviews here, that I honestly don't know what more I can add.    I'm in my mid-30's, and although an avid music lover, I never really got into the Beatles for one reason or another.  I heard Revolver in high school, and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was a revelation.  I purchased that CD, but I stopped there.  Weird, right?    I say this because I am experiencing many of these albums in their entirety for the first time.  I thought this set would be an excellent document of one of the most influential bands of all time.  I couldn't have been more correct.    The mono mixes sound so wonderful!  In \\"Yesterday\\", it really does sound like Paul is right there in the room with you.  Everything sounds so cohesive.  Then, I listened to Sgt. Pepper.  Remember, I have never heard this in stereo (except what has been played on the radio)from beginning to end, so I can't compare it with the mono mix.  Unreal.  Why the hell hadn't I purchased this earlier??    My only regret is the missing final feedback note in the guitar solo of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".  I had grown so accustomed to the stereo version, it still bothers me just a little bit.  Other than that, a beautiful testament to one of the greatest bands of all time.  Well worth the investment!
0385504225|1.0|I have found Dan Brown's previous works mildly entertaining, but this one barely kept me interested enough to care about the conclusion.

0307266303|5.0|I am not an ultra runner, but a long time runner, and my interest was primarily about the Tarahumara Indians that can run endlessly in relatively simple, hard rubber soled sandals and fast enough to compete with the worlds best ultra runners. These shy tribesmen live in a very remote area of northern Mexico and the author seeks them out to learn their secret and to change the way his large, frequently injured body runs. I was initially amused by the author's running plights, many sounded familiar, and I was somewhat confused by his seeking of a ghost named Caballo that ran among the Indians until it became evident that Caballo was real and essentially was an American seeking refuge among the Indians for the simple life and a zealous dedication to ultra running. The author covers a lot of ground about amazingly getting several tribesman to run a rugged ultra race in America against the best and in turn, the amazing part, eventually recruits the national champion and several other fascinating runners (and characters) to travel an immense distance into the primitive area of the Tarahumara to run an ultra on their course. The author takes a commercial break to run several chapters that are quite interesting about the biological differences of species and in particularly what makes man a better long distance runner than animals. He also covers nutrition and of particular interest, a lot of detail on how the Tarahumara run as in barefoot and pretty much whacks Nike and the Saint of Nike Bill Bowerman in producing bulky, gait neutralizing shoes that create, in the minimalist theory, greater injuries and less efficiency. I do recall well, simple Adidas Gazelles in the 70s, lightweight, flat running shoes that felt great to workout in and light enough for the financially challenged runner to race in. Interesting theory whether you agree or not, I think there is some merit but like Shoe Guy in 'Running Times\\" said, we grew up with wearing shoes with heels so it's not for everyone\\" (by the way, he owns a lot of running stores too). He gets back to the race, describing the competitive event in exciting detail. The course features extraordinary rugged terrain and the hazards involved with minimal water on the course in a hot climate that is beyond challenging. In fact, the group run before the race turned into a scary YOYO run (your on your own) that almost cost them the dynamic, hard partying couple from VA. Beach. Some of the folk like Caballo and Barefoot Ted seem like a product of the imagination but they are real and you can actually find them on the web. The book is quite expansive, taking you on a literal bold journey to a remote and simple part of the world while espousing on the extreme lifestyle of running and living that is perpetual happiness for many and a completely different lifestyle for the critter that runs ultrasyone\\" (by the way, he owns a lot of running stores too).

B00005NRO3|5.0|\\"Scream 2\\" is the intense sequel to one of the biggest money-making horror films of the nineties. Very few sequels are as good as the original, but \\"Scream 2\\" has as many plot twists and shocking and scary surprises as the first. Heroine Sidney Prescott is at college when a copycat killer starts to murder victims. Heart pounding, nail biting, and blood curdling are all reactions you will experience upon viewing \\"Scream 2\\". The film itself enjoyed immense success at the boxoffice when it was originally released in 1997. The opening is one of the best as patrons are enjoying a movie called \\"Stab\\" when actual murders take place in the theatre. These patrons believe that a stunt is taking place when in actuality a woman is dying right in front of them. A final movie in the \\"Scream\\" series would be released in 2000 and that would mark the conclusion to one of the greatest horror franchises in cinema history. This single sided DVD only comes with the trailer and cast filmographies.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Cameron began writing this in 1994 (BEFORE TITANTIC was released) and had to put on hold, in order to wait for technology to catch up. There is no computer animation to this movie other than helping to create the scenery. This is one of the most beautiful and EXCITING movies I have ever seen. I have seen it in 3D both in IMAX, and regular 3D. I have not gotten any dizziness or anything! This is definitely one of those movies that is worth the money to see in theaters, in 3D- So do not wait! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD! Its a wonderful movie with phenomenal graphics!
B00012QM8G|5.0|One of the greatest Steven Speilberg films ever made, \\"Shindler's List\\" is widely regarded as the best movie to ever dramatize the horriffic trauma that Jewish people faced during Hitler's terrifying reign. Winner of an amazing seven Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director, \\"Shindler's List\\" accounts how Oskar Shindler (played beautifully by Liam Neeson) saved the lives of over 1100 Jews. Ralph Fiennes, one of my favorite actors, plays a moody, murderous man working for Hitler, who possesses the soul of the devil. The DVD is breathtaking and comes with an array of informative bonus features that puts light on the film. Included are interviews with the cast and crew, most notably Speilberg, on how \\"Shindler's List\\" was made and its impact on the public consciousness  upon its release, as well as trailers, and so much more. The movie is a whopping 3 hours and 16 minutes, the perfect companion for a Sunday afternoon. \\"Shindler's List\\" will make you think about respect for fellow humans and the debths that evil will take to try to override the good in the world.
B000YEUUCK|3.0|The DVD version is fine, but with the Blu Ray they forgot to make a subtitle track for the documentaries that show subtitles when English is not being spoken.  A default subtitle track is supposed to be set for movies and bonus features where non-English is spoken among English.  This way you only see subtitles on the screen when someone is not speaking English.  Since they screwed that up here, you have to manually set the caption for English every time someone speaks other (which on this program is very frequently)  Either that or you have to leave the subtitles on the whole time which is distracting.  This screw-up is almost as bad as rereleasing \\"Waterworld\\" for Bluray and DVD but only putting the extended version on the DVD.  If they want people to take bluray seriously as the new home video standard, they need to quit screwing around.  Celine's show is great though.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie reinvents Star Trek for the younger viewers, but still holds true to the foundation of the original series. Full of action from beginning to end with enough connections to the original to keep the trekkers happy, in my opinion. Many of the actors do an excellent job of fitting into the main roles without trying to completely copy the original actors. The inclusion of Leonard Nimoy in the movie was an excellent tribute to his influence in the entire Star Trek genera and shows how much he is still appreciated by everyone even today.
B002SF9YNO|2.0|First off, let me just say that I DO love this film.  I saw it when it reached my local art-house theater, and I thought it was a fantastic motion picture.  If this review was just for the film, I would easily give it five stars.    Sadly, the DVD has one glaring issue that, to me, is a major annoyance.  On the English subtitle track (the only one, I might add) for the film, sound effect descriptions are included.  Now I understand that such items are necessary for closed-captioning and English SDH subtitles -- but not for regular translations of dialogue and text/signs from one language to another.  They certainly aren't used in theatrical subtitles of foreign-language films.  Some people may not mind one way or another, but I don't need to be notified all of the time when [chime rings] or [door closes] or [mutters to self].    If there is anyone at E1 Entertainment, or whoever published and distributed this in the US, I ask of you:  please find some way to correct this.
B002MBSZ98|5.0|With hundreds of reviews already published, it is hard to be distinctive.  So, I thought some observations about what has been said here and elsewhere are in order.    It has always been known that progressive music demands your attention to truly be appreciated. This applies to all sub-genres, including New Age (a segment of progressive that has been unfairly blasted as being gentle, without form, without emotion, without substance, fluff or background music). As one reviewer stated, this album and progressive music in general requires \\"...concentration, focused 100% in listening [to] the whole album\\". The best prog hits on a cerebral and emotional level.  You can't dance to it (normally due to the time signatures).  Your energy is being focused on listening to the music, not just hearing it, even if you could dance to it (The League of Gentlemen and KC's Neurotica are examples.)    Criticism abounds that progressive rock is heartless and unemotional.  That is certainly an overstatement, applicable to a minor amount of music.  IN the case of any genre, the best music moves your soul.  Prog also challenges your mind.  I cannot imagine a better example of the emotional aspect of prog than Epitaph. The whole album conveys emotion but Epitaph is the standout.  Greg Lake's singing is very good and the instrumental work is superb.  The Mellotron crescendo follwed by the nimble acoustic guitar work is particularly astounding. (As a sidenote, Greg Lake's singing an excerpt of Epitaph on the live version of Tarkus sends chills down my spine.)    When I first listened to the LP in 1969, I remember turning my head to the speakers, finding a place to sit and was enraptured by the sounds that emanated out.    If you have heard Giles, Giles and Fripp, you would know what a quantum leap this album represents. Gone are the very English pop /psychedelia / humor for serious / end of the world / proto metal crunching (a hint of this on Erudite Eyes).  With purported initial sales ofonly 400, it would stand to reason that something had to change.  Rodney Toad is banished for the 21st Century Schizoid Man. What made these individuals go from being just a footnote in the annals of rock to being one of the forerunners of something new, something uncharted in the rock genre? What was the catalyst?  Was it technology advancements? Was it confidence in their muse and each other?    As happens in many cases (and as it appears in the case with KC) those involved in the development are unaware of the importance of their work. Providing the milestone for others to follow has a distinct disadvantage of not having many, if any, references to guide the way.  Now, the group has become the standard bearer and has shown the way for others (and there have been legions of others) to follow.    Being at the forefront is also fraught with pitfalls and this LP does have them.  Many, many people have mentioned the tepidness of Moonchild - the wandering (meandering) of the band after the singing ends and the guitar sustain fades away.  Maybe that is why Robert Fripp removed it from the track on the Frame by Frame box set.     Even though the reviews have been for In the Court of the Crimson King, there appears to be a discussion about which version of King Crimson was / is better. Of course this impacts on a person's view as to which KC album is considered the best. I think it may be the hardest to choose by those who started listening to the band from their onset.  The choosing is so difficult because each KC period offered something completely different.    You have:    Giles, Giles and Fripp (The precursor)  King Crimson (From In the Court of the Crimson King to Islands)  King Crimson (From Lark's Tongue in Aspic to USA)  King Crimson (From Discipline to Three of a Perfect Pair)  King Crimson (Thrak)  The ProjeKCts (A bridge between Thrak and the next period)  King Crimson (From The Construction of Light to Level 5)    Each period of King Crimson has a masterpiece.  It is like comparing apples and oranges as to which masterpiece is better.  Why bother?  In the Court of the Crimson King is the masterpiece for the first period.  There are songs from other albums from that period that are as good as and maybe better than what is on this album. Fripp has stated that Bolero from the Lizard LP is his personal favorite from that period.    This album started the engines of Heavy Metal, Symphonic Rock, Progressive, Art Rock etc.  It pointed the way for Italian Progressive Rock.  All roads lead to the UK as Mecca for Progressive Music and King Crimson was pointing the way.    I have gotten the most recent incarnation of the album: the monstrous 5 CD + DVD-A set. There can be no complaint about the shear quantity and quality of the music provided, here. The Japanese version of the set comes with the mini-LP sleeves.  The sleeves represent two UK pressings, a Canadian pressing, a pressing from Argentina, a US pressing that also contains three Promotional Copy stickers and the Japanese pressing with Obi strip.    The CD's are picture discs and if you align the discs, you get a partial picture of the face on the front of the sleeve.  Very nice.    The sound is impeccable.  Robert Fripp has always pursued the quality of the sound to be life like and to this end, he has succeeded wonderfully.  Is there a different between this version (2009 and 2004) to the 30th Anniversary edition?  Yes, indeed.  Moonchild has been significantly remixed for the 2009 remastering and the overall sound on both the 2009 and 2004 versions is a markedly improved, but that does not mean the 30th anniversary version is terrible. On the contrary, if one did not have the updated versions, one may not notice any discernable degradation of sound.  I have not heard the DVD-A version but from accounts of others, it is a wonder and that Steven Wilson has done a tremendous job.    Is it worth the money?  That is a question that I cannot answer for anyone else but me.  Itis worth the cost for the sound, alone.  The DVD-A is not region coded and can play in any region.
B001TH16DI|5.0|No need for a review of the movies. If you're a trekkie, then you know and love these. If not, you wouldn't be here! Also, be warned that these are the theatrical releases, so you don't have the extra footage available on the dvds. That being said, the BR transfers are incredible. I'm seeing details that I never knew existed! The colors are crisp and bright. The details are almost too sharp.    And that's my biggest \\"issue\\" with the video quality. Images are so sharp and clear, that the comparatively poor quality of the FX shots really come out. Likewise, some of the cheesiness of the sets and costumes also comes through. Granted, this is a product of the FX technology and not the BR, so its not a real problem. Overall, this is a good problem.    The real problem is the audio quality. Lots of volume juggling will be required. Otherwise, sounds are also crisp and clear.    Bottomline, these were a great value. I already have the dvd's and these blow those out of the water. Issues aside, I can't wait to pick up the TOS BluRays.
0446567337|5.0|The only bad thing that I have to say about this book is....SPOILER!!! John and Savannah didn't end up together. That broke my heart and makes me cry every time I think about it. I love the book though. There was so much emotion in every page. No matter what was on the page, you could feel it. I can't wait for Feb 5 when the movie comes out!
044654146X|4.0|I had some idea of how innovative the Israelis are - but this book was an eye opener - what is happening in Israel is amazing and terrific - an engine for their economy and for the world at large indeed.    I was struck by how important the Israeli military experience has been for the many companies and success stories they talk about.  The story about the battery powered car was illuminating indeed ... change the battery in the time it takes to fill a tank of gas ... I cannot wait to see how that experiment fares in Israel.    The book also underscores why Israel is so hated around the world by so many - simply because they are very good at what they can do and do it inspite of the hatred towards their tiny nation ... Perhaps it is their will to survive and thrive that makes such amazing innovations possible - but I see Israel Envy everywhere ... and it is most unfortunate.    At times when reading the book, I wanted to jump on a plane and head there ... spend some time in the universities, the society at large - definitely a country to visit and spend a LOT of time in ...
0525421033|2.0|This book was bittersweet for me because the storyline is beautiful, but the language is so filthy and harsh that it was hard for me to want to finish the book, though my curiosity for how the book would end won over (which I had predicted so I guess I just needed to confirm I was right).  Maybe the author wanted to make it 'real' by including all the harsh language, but to me it was just 'real' offensive.  I give the storyline five stars, but the choice of constant filthy language throughout the book, zero stars. I will definitely be making sure my daughters don't read this book.  I love to read, but if my head is going to be filled with filth along the way, the book isn't worth it no matter how fabulous the story is.
B000H7JD4A|4.0|A Matter of Life and Death being Iron Maiden's 14th studio and their latest release of new material up to date. The album was a chart topper in many countries and reached #1 in Poland, Sweden and Finland. Tracks that I especially like are \\"Different World\\", \\"The Longest Day\\" and \\"The Reincarnation of Benjamin Breeg\\". The Sound is a mix between Heavy Metal and Hard Rock. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with many great photos of the members of the band individually and then a final group photo. Allmusic gave the album 3.5 and Kerrang! 5. 4/5.
B000SEI230|5.0|this is for sure the best book i  have ever read. i had seen the movie before i read th book but yet i till bawled my eyes out even knowing what was going to happen. again a mater peace by the master of all master.
031606792X|5.0|I'm a 37 year old married mother of four and if loving the Twilight Series is wrong, I don't want to be right!  I was very hesitant to order this book after reading the reviews.  I had read only the first two of four when I placed my order for Eclipse and Breaking Dawn, and had it not been for the smokin' prices Amazon.com was & is offering, I would not have ordered Book 4 due to the poorly rated reviews.  Thankfully though, the deals lured me in because Breaking Dawn was fantastic!  I do hope when it comes to movie production, it is done in two feature-length films as the unique writing perspective will be lost if not for the proper movie producing.      Long story short, order the book.  It's fabulous!!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I've bought three CDs and am now ordering two more:  One for myself and the rest for gifts for Valentine's Day gifts.  I hadn't expected to enjoy the CD as much as I did.  The U-Tube video which shows her capturing the attention of the judges and the audience is a must-see.  I will be using it as an assignment for my course, Intercultural Communication, to illustrate that you can never judge a book by its cover, that first impressions are almost always deceiving.
0312370849|5.0|This book was hard to put down! I love the way the writer brings the past and the present together.  The characters are very realistic. Great book from beginning to end. Even though the historical part of the book is sad and disturbing the way the book is pulled together in the end is pleasant and heart warming.
B00127RAJY|5.0|LAYOUT OF REVIEW:  -intro  -eating habits & tips  -Session # stats    Hey everyone!  I'm going to be coming back to this review every other week or so to post my results as I go through Jillian's 30 Day Shred (1 work week each of Levels 1-3, repeat).  I can tell you that after ONLY 6 sessions, I zoomed into Target and shopped for my first real MIDRIFF BARING swimsuit because I could now fit into one without being ashamed of my figure and it's now hanging on my closet for inspiration to be thinner this summer.  Keep in mind that I haven't been a saint about doing the workouts either; I did 3 days of Level 1 and on my 4th day of Level 2 and I'm still seeing results.    Here are my eating habits just for background knowledge and some may help you: I drink as much water as I can (NO SODA POP!); I eat smaller portions fit for children; if I eat at a fast food place, I order a plain hamburger OR grilled chicken sandwich sans mayo OR grilled chicken salad; if I'm hungry during the day, I always have wheat crackers with peanut butter handy (PB is amazing for this diet); I don't eat past 8pm so I'll be hungry in the morning to get my metabolism going (usually waffles w/ PB & honey).  Quick tip: my mom cut out HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP from her diet and lost over 30 POUNDS, I lost some, and we both have more energy, so cut out as much candy and processed foods as possible!!!!!  As for baked goodies that are \\"better\\" for you than corn syrupy candy, only have a teeny weeny bit to satisfy your sweet tooth, because if you're like me, once you think about something sweet, you crave it and will go overboard if you deny yourself, so only have enough to not go crazy.    SESSION 1 STATS: petite 5'3\\", size 12 pants, 151 pounds (I look 20 pounds smaller than this sounds, really); trouble spots (being shorter, I have lots of these): muffin top, larger thighs, love handles, upper ab flab.    SESSION 6 STATS: size 10 pants (my size 12 jeans are getting irritatingly baggy), 149 pounds; as for trouble spots: muffin top is DEFLATING, thighs are beginning to get a GAP in between them, love handles are SHRINKING, and my upper abs are SMOOTHING OUT nicely.  Other effects by this time: butt is SHAPING UP and lower legs are TONED.  Also, my usually-muscular arms are even more so in a healthy-looking way (not like a lady body builder--ick).  I guess not many women have this, but I've usually had defined obliques (even when heavier---weird) but the workouts have made them even deeper.     SESSION 9 STATS: Size 10 pants. 151 pounds but this is muscle mass, I believe, because I look much leaner than a few sessions ago. My back is more TONED and face is THINNER.  My energy is up and moving around at work is much easier.  Back to the bottom: my butt is not that big bump anymore, but it is TEARDROP-SHAPED now!  And keep in mind, people, that all this is after only 2 weeks of total workouts.    SESSION 13 STATS:  Size 10 pants are getting looser!  Gained weight, but that is fat-eating muscle, and the fat around my middle and on my thighs have been MELTING AWAY.  Be wary that if you're like me, you'll crave large portions and fatty foods (say, Pizza Hut like we had last night!) once the workout is over, so stick to fresh produce, grains, and yogurt.  My lower abs are much FLATTER and when I sit in a chair (when women are at risk for the ugly muffin top!), my stomach barely goes over the top of my jeans.  I'm still having trouble getting rid of my love handles completely, so I'm experimenting by eating only Cheerios and yogurt for breakfast and lunch, then a regular LOW-FAT dinner.  I'm guessing the bad or excess fat I take in goes straight to the love handles, so it's time to put a stop to that!    SESSION 17 STATS: Still in size 10 pants, but those are starting to get looser, as well.  My arms around the shoulder area are NO LONGER BULGING, the gap between my thighs is bigger, arms are seriously TONED.  However, I'm still battling my midsection to keep up with the rest of my body.  This isn't a negative about the program, I just need to reduce calorie and fat intake to make my body burn what I've already got.  Level 3 certainly fires up the furnace!    OKAY....I've had to start over because I let \\"busy\\" get in the way and I'm dearly paying for it.  Here's what happened:  ---you probably lost weight, but the week you have to stop for woman issues or just stop for any old reason, you're body may gain the weight back as upper abdominal flab (as fat redistributes on your body).  If you stop, you may crave very unhealthy foods.  ---SO, to begin again, you'll have renewed cravings for healthier food and it should be easier this time around because instead of getting rid of the stuff you lost in the first place, you're trying to lose MORE, and the results will be more gratifying.    One more WARNING: there are tons of squats and lunges in this DVD, so your knees will ache quite a bit as long as you do these workouts.  When I stopped, I realized my knee pain was gone, so it is back and definitely from this workout.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Great music, has made a nice Christmas gift. I will buy another one for myself. It was delivered even earlier than i expected.  Never had any problems with the Amazon items.
0670021652|4.0|I just finished reading Committed by Elizabeth Gilbert. I enjoyed it so much that I read the first 2/3's in one day. I almost didn't buy it because of so many mixed reviews and reviews that said it was nothing like Eat, Pray, Love. To me it was  the perfect sequel. What I realised is that enjoying the book probably depends on where you are in your life or relationship. When I read Eat, Pray, Love I was very single & dating. Probably a bit disillusioned by the dating scene and looking for something deeper & more fulfilling for myself. Reading about someone in a similar situation and how she found her way through it was exactly what I needed. Reading her book now, from a pretty new (just over a year) but committed relationship where neither of us feels the need or want to have a formal commitment ceremony, I can relate to her journey once again. For me, this book was perfect, but had I read Committed then & Eat, Pray, Love now, I think I would've enjoyed them, but wouldn't have gotten so much out of them and learned so much about myself in the process.
0143038583|4.0|Pollan writes on many things that some of us know and many things that many do not know about our industrial vs family farm food system. Although I have for many, many years spoken to individuals and groups on this subject, I found several new things to ponder. He gives us good reasons to look more deeply into the choices we make about the foods we eat daily, weekly and monthly. If you have strong convictions on the types of foods you will and will not eat, or about being vegetarian-vs-not, it is helpful and eye-opening to read what Pollan writes about food production. The way in which corn affects our daily lives, our political system, our national economy, and the livelihoods of the people who produce our food will likely surprise you if you've not already heard. The book on the one hand can be considered a masterpiece for the amount of information that it provides and also something that'll make your head spin from the great amount of information garnered from a mere 2 pages of the writing. It is well written, yet dense.    I recommend it for anyone wishing to know more about food production in the USA and for those that want to make conscious choices about the foods they eat for either personal or political reasons. This book is a great way to get started...more and more books on this subject will definitely follow.
031606792X|5.0|I LOVED how this book ended. This is my favourite of the four books and I've actually reread the entire saga all of twelve times! To those of us who understand and feel the magic of the entire saga, the ending was all that it should be and more.  The author connected all the dots to culminate in an appropriate confrontation that despite what some people said, ended with panache. Well done Stephenie, ignore the nay-sayers - to each his own.
0451228731|5.0|Most of the reviews discuss the plot and the technology.  I'm writing this review to emphasize the general level of the writing; it is very impressive for a first (or nth, for that matter) novel.  It flows very smoothly,  sustaining its pace without sagging in the middle. The multiple point of view technique is often an obviously double-edged sword, but here it is handled very well, without intrusion or disruption.      My only regret is that it took me so long to try it..
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Reprise put a gun to Buble's head and demanded a CD, so Buble threw one together filled with incongruous songs. There is no better example of this than Heartache Tonight in which some first year jazz students at Berklee were given one hour to jazzify this Hendley/Eagles tune, adding as much brass as possible. No it doesn't work. Maybe Michael's next CD will include his jazz versions of Ozzy's Crazy Train and Skynyrd's Free Bird  - hey we're at the \\"whatever sells\\" stage of his career.
B002ZG997M|4.0|This wound up being better than expected. The first few trailers and TV spots were interesting as they completely avoided spoilers relating to the film. More recent TV spots, ones that were being shown as recent as yesterday, pretty much spoil what the book actually is. You may have already been able to guess what particular book it is, but seeing everything unfold without any expectations or predictions is the best way to see the film. The Book of Eli seemed to be going in a direction that was predictable at times, but then went down an unexpected detour to end up at a completely separate destination. Without spoiling too much, the events that are revealed in the finale of the film make the entire experience worthwhile. What transpires in the last twenty minutes or so pretty much makes you want to watch the film again and solidifies the Eli character as a vagabond of the most ultimate caliber.<br /><br />Denzel Washington's portrayal of a man who's gotten so caught up in the mission that's been given to him that he's forgotten how it feels to interact with genuine people is nearly flawless. Well, that and the action scenes he's a part of are spectacular and incredibly exciting to watch. The rather underrated Gary Oldman does a fantastic job of making you hate his character, as well. Carnegie is so smarmy and selfish that you nearly jump for joy once the empire he's built begins to crumble. It was surprising, in a good way, to see Malcolm McDowell have a small part in the film. Although his character doesn't have much screen time, he still made a small impact. Tom Waits as the Engineer managed to have a few great scenes with Denzel Washington, as well. Mila Kunis didn't really offer anything new as far as her acting goes, but she fit the Solara role pretty well. Jennifer Beals seemed to be the weak link in the cast though. She has a scene with Gary Oldman where she begins to break down and start crying that just didn't feel up to par with the rest of the cast, but that could be classified as a nitpick.<br /><br />The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go. The film's storyline is a bit reminiscent of films like Fahrenheit 451 and Equilibrium since all three films deal with book burning in a not too distant future. There's actually one scene near the end of the film where Eli and Solara are in a boat that brought Children of Men to mind, a trait that is purely meant as a compliment. The Book of Eli delivers a highly entertaining ride from beginning to end composed of strong performances from the cast, an enticing story, and a blindsided ending. Highly recommended.d be classified as a nitpick.     The Book of Eli is a great way to start the new year with a bang as far as moviegoing experiences go.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|Well, I think other reviewers have already done a terrific job discussing the story and numerous movie references in Quentin Tarantino's latest film \\"Inglourious Basterds,\\" so I will make my review brief. The real star of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" is neither Brad Pitt nor Diane Kruger. It is Christoph Waltz as COL. Hans Landa, whose great performance deserves its own film.     From the moment he steps into a farmer's house in occupied France (very intense Chapter 1, the best part of the film), we know Tarantino made a right choice. When the film is not boring, his character - smooth-talking, cunning and chilling - is always there. (Almost equally great is Michael Fassbender and the gripping basement scene involving his LT. Archie Hicox should not be missed.)    Probably those who have seen his \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" must know what is coming in Tarantino's take of a WWII-revenge story set in alternate Europe. Lots of violence have become a kind of trademark of the director (and I personally don't think it is a bad thing for any director), but the violence in his previous movies has never been tasteless like this. Scalping? Hitting a defenseless man with a bat? Surely cinema wins the war, but in a very inglourious way.    This brings me back to where I started: Christoph Waltz. I can forget the tedious dialogues, pointless movie references (Brad Pitt as Aldo \\"Raine\\"?) and the presence of wooden Eli Roth, but not the ending which I strongly disagree with. See what happens to the best (and obviously cleverest) character in the film, and you know what I mean. But after all, this is a Brad Pitt film.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a must have for any Blu Ray collection. I am about half way through the series and have fully enjoyed each episode, and cannot wait to watch the next one. I am taking my time with it because I want it to last. First off, the price was excellent. I purchased it for $39.99 with free shipping, the day it was on sale other customers were stating that they bought it for $31.99 and were saying $39.99 was too much. $39.99 is still a great price considering it is about eighty bucks at best buy, not to mention it is the best audio and video I have seen on Blu Ray yet.People talk about how Planet Earth is really good as well, I own them both and BOB is much better. The only gripe I could make was during the first couple episodes it was difficult to keep track of the soldiers during the initial battle scenes....I was also a little distracted watching the first couple of episodes, so it is probably just me. The additional features are great with commentary from the real members of Easy Company. I never knew the series was a true story, which makes it even better. You will not be disappointed and will be hooked and mesmerized instantly. I would probably wait until the price drops to about forty dollars again, I am sure it will.
0307702103|2.0|I struggled whether to give this one or two stars. I opted for two because there were a few moment, albeit brief, where I was slightly entertained. It could be that this would be a better book read than listened to. I struggled greatly with John's narration. I found it incredibly choppy and difficult to follow. It seemed like he used voice inflection at all the wrong places. It was read like I would expect a business report to be - ho hum and list-like. I think he would have fired anyone else who auditioned to read his work like this! Perhaps without this distraction it would have been ok. But certainly no better than ok.
B001VB8UAE|4.0|I was lucky to have seen this concert in person. So, I was quite anxious to get the dvd. There is only one problem. The audio. I have a Bose surround sound system. The audio options on this DVD are for Stereo or DTS Surround. On a Bose system you can not chose the DTS surround because the Bose system automatically enhances any Stereo or Dolby Digital to DTS. So, if you chose DTS when viewing you will hear nothing. You have to choose stereo or Dolby Digital (if available) Almost all DVD's have these options. So on this DVD, I would have to choose stereo under the audio, and than click a button on my Bose remote to convert to surround. When you do this it sound really good and not that much is lost. The problem is when I do this on this concert, the music is very thin sounding. You can hardly hear the drums, bass etc..I have never had this problem on any other DVD and I have loads of them. Could this just be a bad DVD??
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I often find that more experimental artists can get lost in being weird and lose focus of the most important part--the music. Florence Welch makes no such mistake. \\"Lungs\\" is accessible and fun to listen to the very first time through. On repeat listens I discovered just how layered and complex the album is. \\"Lungs\\" hits everything for me-great vocals, lyrics, arrangements and just has that special thing that makes you realize that ten years from now you'll still love the songs as much as you do now. Outstanding.<br /><br />***edit-- I loved this cd so much that I went and bought the couple songs on the deluxe version because I had to have more. And I'm so happy I did because one of those songs \\"Swimming\\" is now probably in my top ten songs of all time...
0307454541|1.0|I bought this book since it was the top seller and many people recommended it but I barely made it to page 200, hoping it will get better after another page but no still boring. I don't know if I can continue read the rest, I have to force myself to read it and not enjoying a bit. Is it really that slow going? Will it really blow my mind after couple of more pages??? I really don't have the urge to try and find out, books goes to the shelf half read!
B0029LHW68|5.0|I've completely fallen in love with the new 30 Seconds To Mars album \\"This Is War\\"....It's emotional, powerful and most of all, it's great to roll the windows down, turn the volume up and just drive to...I will admit that several of the songs make me speed, but that's what freeway driving is for right?
0307454541|5.0|Recommended by a friend i was somewhat sceptical of the book. Once started, it was difficult to put down. a multi-threaded thriller of note. Very different from the usual American or English thriller. I went on to read the other two books in the trilogy immediately after this one and all in all i benefited from the experience - many new ideas and concepts. definitely worthwhile reading. A pity there will be no more from this author.
B002VKE1K2|2.0|I love ghost and other types of scary movies. I like the Blair Witch Project a lot, but this movie has too many flaws and just does not cut the mustard. The main fault is the male character just does not act how a normal human would act and it destroys the illusion of the movie world. The movie is worth a quick rent, but don't expect much.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|This was my first Michael Buble purchase and I must say I was quite dissapointed.  He's got a fantastic voice.  The problem is song selection and arrangements. Two examples: \\"Cry Me A River\\" is one of the worst remakes I have ever heard by anyone and there are no words to describe \\"Heartache Tonight\\".  Repeat listens make this album better though - - you just have to open your mind if you are familar with the way these songs were traditionally arranged.
B001EN71DQ|1.0|Lucas totally ruined Star Wars with these movies. He has made it very apparent that he is only talented as an \\"idea man.\\" He is a terrible director and an even worse writer.    I recommend not watching them if you haven't and only viewing the original trilogy which Lucas only slightly damaged with the 1997 Special Edition releases.    The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones are both completely unwatchable. Revenge of the Sith is somewhat entertaining as a movie that is so dumb it is comical.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|My expectation of this film was that it would be more or less a compilation and reinforcement of information I had gleaned from having seen the eye-opening film \\"Fast Food Nation\\" several years ago, and having just finished reading the excellent books \\"Animal,Vegetable Miracle\\" and \\"In Defense of Food\\" among others. However, this film is more than the sum of those books and that movie.     Food Inc. is an extremely well made documentary in part because of the personal stories told by interviewees, as well as the hidden camera footage. I was especially impressed by what's happening to farmers.     The material is so well investigate and presented. Multiple aspects of food production, marketing and consumption are covered. There is no \\"time out\\" in this movie, it's one hit after another. All shocking and important information we citizens need to be concerned about.    Kudos to all involved in the making of this incredibly important film. Thank you to those who stuck their neck out to tell the truth.    Yes it is disturbing, but you need to watch it.
0143116177|2.0|In spite of its grandiose title, \\"The Ascent Of Money: A Financial History Of The World\\" is more a history of financial bubbles in the modern world, leading up to the last three decades in the U.S. with its recent tech-stock bubble, housing bubble, mortgage and credit bubbles, etc. Readers who are interested in financial history pre-1600, or outside of Europe, will not be satisfied.<br /><br />As a history of modern finance, \\"The Ascent Of Money\\" presupposes quite a bit of knowledge on the part of the reader. According to its introduction, one purpose of the book was to educate the financially naive. However, most financial concepts in the book are introduced by a one-liner type of explanation the first time they come up, and then taken for granted thereafter. This is inadequate even for basic concepts like why bond yields and prices move in different directions, let alone for advanced instruments like the notorious RMBS CDOs (\\"residential mortgage-backed security collateralized debt obligations\\"). It makes the numerous stories of financial malfeasance, gleefully recounted in this book, pretty hard to understand. For example, after reading Ferguson's account of the U.S. S&L crisis of the 1980's, I was left wondering what those folks - many of whom actually went to jail - actually did wrong.<br /><br />The book goes into just enough detail to be confusing, and there is also a lot of cherry-picking in terms of topics; many important historical developments (like the rise of central banking in the early U.S.) are skimmed over if not left out entirely. The book offers little in the way of broad economic (let alone historical) perspective, and adopts a narrowly crisis-driven view of its subject. To summarize, this \\"Financial History Of The World\\" isn't.
014305841X|4.0|Like other reviewers, I've been pondering diet and food since I read \\"Fast Food Nation\\" and saw \\"Super Size Me\\".<br /><br />Much has been written about this book, so I'll be brief.<br /><br />PRAISE<br /><br />I found Michael Pollan's book to be a fascinating account of modern eating. As I listened to the audio version, I also enjoyed the narrator.<br /><br />I initially thought that the book was ordered backwards (holding hunting/gathering toward the end of the book rather than starting with it), but the process makes far more sense the way the author/editor structured the book.<br /><br />I appreciated the author's refusal to fall for the doctrine of specific etiology. I appreciated Mr. Pollan's willingness to 'hold the questions,' and not fall prey to the most recent cutting-edge single solution that science is offering us.<br /><br />I've never hunted in my life, so I found the account of his hunting trip fascinating. I fly-fish, so I appreciated Pollan's discussion of the inside/outside perspectives of the hunter. Those thoughts fit well with my experience in fly-fishing.<br /><br />CRITICISMS<br /><br />The only down sized to the book is the author's somewhat annoying habit of using exceptionally complex words/phrases when simpler words/phrases could be used. (This coming from a writer who loves words ...).<br /><br />I also found the author to be a rather Western-centric. Buddhisms and other Eastern perspectives have been discussing the merits of vegetarianism for far longer than we in the West have. (Early in the book, Pollan makes it sounds like vegetarianism is a recent development). Also, it was no surprise to me when Pollan reported that he could find mushrooms more easily when his teacher was present. That one often performs better in the presence of a teacher is a truism in the martial arts world (and, as I understand it, the Yoga world as well).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />For me, the praise outshines the criticisms.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|Torchwood is an anagram of and series spin off of the 'Doctor Who' franchise.  Dr. Who was awesome to such a point where I was interested in even the ancillary shows, so I viewed Torchwood, hoping for more.  No luck.  What really makes Dr. Who great is the acting and characterization of the Doctor himself.  Torchwood has nothing like him.  It's budget is low, the Weevils are silly, and the relationships are a mess.    The relationships, let me go into them more.  If male/male and female/female is your thing, you'll love Torchwood.  In the first season every one of the five main characters gets a same sex kiss, and often more, much more.  'Edgy,' which should not be confused for 'good plot' or 'good acting.'  Now this is something I could live with if the science fiction element was as strong or interesting as Dr. Who.  A couple episodes which didn't concentrate on the main cast like 'Random Shoes' and 'Small Worlds' were really good.  They carry the show up to three stars for me.      Probably the biggest dislike I had for the show was how Captain Jack Harkness reacted to his subordinates.  They don't follow his orders.  They don't listen to him.  He's 'in charge' only during the tense chases when they have a clearly defined enemy.  As soon as a decision comes along which doesn't have immediate consequences, they ignore his orders.  This never ends well, and by series finale, become more of a question of 'Why are these people still employed at Torchwood?'     My favorite character was Suzie, because she really personifies the tone and spirit of the series.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|A terrific update of the Beowulf tale. Great cast (including John Hurt as a Viking Chief!), good pacing ... just a lot of fun! IMHO, there's a lot of junk coming out of Hollywood these days, and this movie (with apparently limited release) is as good as most.<br /><br />Recommended for when you're in the mood for an action-adventure.
1933308087|5.0|I've had my copy of The Quilter's Album of Patchwork Patterns for about a week now, and I am simply astounded by the wealth of information in this book.  The blocks are well-categorized, making it easy to find what I'm looking for.  I was especially thrilled to find that the blocks were all illustrated in color, as well as accompanied by a line drawing.    I recommend this book for any quilter who loves to work with traditional blocks.  It will be an invaluable reference guide for years to come.
B002T9H2MO|3.0|This movie is very different than your average science fiction films.  It relies much less on FX and concentrates on the drama instead.  The problem is that the cast size is extremely limited which makes for a very slow story line at times.  You're basically dealing with one guy alone on the moon. Kind of like Castaway in space, but with a twist thrown in.    The story starts with the main character counting down the days to go home.  He's been alone on the Moon for nearly three years with nothing but the AI system for company and now he's desperate to get back home.  But as the minutes tick down he discovers there were some things about his assignment they didn't tell him.  And so it goes, you find out a little bit at a time what the back-story to his assignment actually was.    The story had potential.  It's offbeat and somewhat original, yet even so I found it a very slow ride.  In short, it's just not that memorable.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|Short Attention Span Summary (abbreviated in the interest of keeping the review readable):<br /><br />1. We find out that everyone in the world can have robots that will go out and work in their place. (\\"Surrogates.\\")<br />2. A guy's surrogate goes out to a club and is killed-- but the device that killed him also was able to fry the brain of (and kill) the Surrogate User.<br />3. This launches an investigation into the nature of the weapon and who developed it and who killed it.<br />4. It turns out that the original inventor of the surrogates started the plot to take down the company that fired him (after they used the work that he created).<br />5. The surrogates all die because of a technical glitch (it was either that or watch their Surrogate User killed) and everyone has to go back to living life as a normal human being.<br /><br />Comments:<br /><br />The makeup/ wardrobe in this film was great. The director showed us the striking contrast between what people actually looked like vs. what their surrogates looked like at the very beginning of the film and then returned to develop the idea very subtly in later parts of the film. So, for example, the attractive female surrogate at the club really belonged to a very fat, ugly white man.  The people at the Reservation (people who refused to accept surrogates) were actually disporportionately fat and ugly (cast to look like real people). There were also several other instances of people's surrogates looking much better than the actual person.<br /><br />On some parts: They goofed a bit. Can someone really believe that Bruce Willis' surrogate survived a helicopter crash and lost an arm to track down a criminal only to get right back up and chase down a criminal-- but then Ving Rhames' surrogate dies from a single bullet to the chest? Can we really be expected to believe that there was a colony of humans who didn't want surrogates-- but was really led by a surrogate and didn't know that he was one (Rhames)?<br /><br />There were also some potential \\"discussion topics\\" from the movie. \\"If you could live life through a surrogate, would you?\\" and so on.<br /><br />This is worth a trip to the theater or a purchase off the New Release shelf.rom the movie. \\"If you could live life through a surrogate, would you?\\" and so on.    This is worth a trip to the theater or a purchase off the New Release shelf.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I am a huge Rush fan and thought the audio and video on the Blu-ray version was outstanding.  Felt like I was there once again.

Must buy for all Rush fans and anyone else who wants to see 3 of the best musicians perform spot on for 3 hours!
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Short Attention Span Summary (WARNING! PLOT SPOILERS):<br /><br />1. The movie opens with a Nice Father enjoying his wife and child. There is a knock at the door, and The Father is knocked down and subdued by Two Bad Men. His wife is raped in front of him and his daughter is killed.<br /><br />2. Jaime Foxx is the lawyer that makes a deal with the men who killed The Father's family. Apparently, there are some Unspecified Technical Reasons that DNA evidence can't be used against the two killers, and one of them gets a slap on the wrist and the other gets a death sentence.<br /><br />3. 10 years later, the person who was to be executed is executed-- but for some reason the execution is very painful. (We later find out that someone has tampered with the execution medicines.)<br /><br />4. The man who got off with a lighter sentence is then set up to flee his house when police are coming to arrest him for some reason. He has a guardian angel that tells him where to go-- but it turns out to be a setup.<br /><br />5. Re-enter The Father, except that now he is The Assassin. So, he drugs the man (paralyzes) and takes him to a warehouse where he saws him into about 24 pieces, and castrates him afterward (making for 25 pieces, total).<br /><br />6. The Assassin deliberately get himself arrested. From prison, he manages to kill quite a few people, including: The judge who gave the lenient sentences to one of the Bad Men, The DA who negotiated the deal. (It is at this point that we find out that he is a Highly Trained Assassin.) Eventually, the city is locked down.<br /><br />7. The ultimate plan was to blow up city hall, but the Assistant DA finds out and moves the bomb back into his cell. The bomb blows up and kills the Highly Trained Assassin.<br /><br />All in all:<br /><br />This was an excellent film. To me, it would be worth seeing at a film (non-matinee price) or even buying off the New Release shelf. There was an excellent plot here, and that plot was enough to keep you interested but not slip into unbelievability. There was also lots of action, but that supplemented the plot (as opposed to films that are full of action in order to try to mask a weak plot). The film raised \\"thought questions\\" about the Justice System that also make for good discussion later on. There was also some very good, subtle casting. When the main character was The Father, he was believable in that role.

B001AQT0RC|4.0|Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), appropriate last name, is a scientist seeking the fringes of space to find if we are alone. Mean time she has to overcome terrestrial impediments as Dr. David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) a limelight-steeling pragmatist, and Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) the religious antagonist. Supported by the mysterious multi-billionaire S.R. Hadden (John Hurt), will Ellie get her wish or is she a victim of Occam's razor.<br /><br />Intriguing story based on a book by Carl Sagan; however, I never read the book to compare. The supposedly two-sided story that becomes two versions of the same argument is rather hokey and one-dimensional.<br /><br />Occam's (or Ockham's) razor is a principle attributed to the 14th century logician and Franciscan friar William of Ockham.  Ockham was the village in the English county of Surrey where he was born.<br />The principle states &quot;Entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.&quot;<br /><br />I have followed the film from the movies to Blu-ray and will probably watch it again when the re-master for 3D or whatever comes next.  However, the basic acting has not changed with any technical innovation.<br /><br />On the positive side, the Blu-ray edition is packed with DVD extras that include several commentaries, trailers and much more. After the commentaries, SETI yourself down and re-watch the movie.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0780778979 Contact by Carl Sagan]]

B002VPE1AM|2.0|have you seen dances with wolves? if the answer is yes you might wanna skip this one.  Its the same story but everyone is blue.      A certain section made this movie some kind of cultural phenomenon and just like other movies and entertainment there are those who are going to learn the language the aliens speak and just go way overboard in an attempt to show how much they think this movie is awesome.  Yeah it was a visual feast no doubt-amazing effects.  The story to provide the conflict is shallow and the characters are pretty surface as well.  This movie would have been way more fun had the story not been the same old recycled stuff we have seen many times before.  Yes Love is more powerful than war, might does not make right, yes humans are dumb careless creatures...all true but theres one problem we've seen all that before.  This movie was far from fresh-sitting there knowing what would happen is not a lot of fun ya know?    I won't even begin to address the overboard fans that \\"envy\\" the aliens in this movie.  Most of these fans couldnt live more than two days with nature since they would go berserk after not getting thier manga/anime/video game fix.    2 stars only because the effects were out of this world...if you are considering a career involving 3-d models and effects you can't miss this otherwise you can-i promise you've probably seen it before.
031237593X|5.0|Historical fiction can be done well--or badly. This novel is in the former category. Sharon Kay Penman's book traces the story of Edward IV and Richard III and those surrounding them. Treachery is a continuing undercurrent in this work (and in the actual history of the times; this is not a literary device).<br /><br />As with most historical novels of this era, it's hard to keep track of the cast of characters. It would have been helpful to have had genealogical tables to help in reading the book and making sense of the dramatis personae. And what a set of players: Marguerite of Anjou; Henry VI; the Woodvilles; the brothers--Edward, Edmund, Richard, and George (the latter both luckless and feckless); the characters who would shift sides as it advanced their interests, such as Buckingham and Stanley and Hastings; the children of the brothers--Edward's two male heirs and his beloved daughters, Richard's children; George's children; Anne Neville, Richard's wife.<br /><br />The story of Edward IV's rise to king as his family survives sanguinary reverses; his luck in war, and his flight to escape doom; his complex family life with the Woodvilles; his relationship with brothers Richard (to succeed him as Richard III) and George (himself a turncoat on more than one occasion); Richard's relationship with his wife Anne; the dynamic and poisonous politics of England after Richard captured the throne from Edward IV's son (an intriguing tale here, to explain Richard's motives beyond just the possibility of becoming king). What of Edward's two sons in the Tower? What became of them? A plausible hypothesis is developed--exculpating Richard III from this particular villainy. And, of course, the lugubrious end of the Plantagenet line, with Edward IV's daughter, Elizabeth, wedding Henry VII (a Tudor), launching the Tudor dynasty.<br /><br />This is really a finely drawn historical novel, with plenty of rich detail. I am not an historian of the era, and I am not well equipped to speak of historical veracity, but it does seem to ring true from other works of the age (e.g., Gregory's \\"The White Queen,\\" Tey's \\"The Daughter of Time,\\" Worth's \\"The King's Daughter,\\" and Cheetham's \\"The Life and Times of Richard III\\").y, but it does seem to ring true from other works of the age (e.g., Gregory's \\"The White Queen,\\" Tey's \\"The Daughter of Time,\\" Worth's \\"The King's Daughter,\\" and Cheetham's \\"The Life and Times of Richard III\\").

Such a build up to this great mystery that we couldn't wait to find the answer to and that was it???<br /><br />Book flows just like DaVinci Code and Angles and Demons.  Time for a new formula...it has gotten old.<br /><br />Also, too much \\"fluff\\" in the story, unnecessary details that seemed to have no point to the story.<br /><br />I'm sure it will be made into a movie...I just hope they improve on it.<br /><br />I enjoyed The Last Templar a lot more than this book, and it has nowhere near the recognition as Brown's books.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is an astounding documentary and study of many facets of life, courage juxtaposed with tom foolery, loyalty contrasted with fickleness, etc. It left me with tears in my eyes for Phillipe's sheer disregard for normalcy, status quo, and security that most of us are happy to settle or strive for, either because we don't have talent, imagination or the will to succeed without approval. This movie screams, \\"Follow your dreams and take risks for God's sake, because life is too short to remain on the sidelines.\\" Bravo Monsieur Petitt.
1932907009|5.0|My disclaimer: As with any opinion, it is only my opinion and these reviews will vary depending on who reads the book and what the reader is looking for. I look for ways to improve businesses, sales, and my life. This book falls under my life where I categorize my hobby of screenwriting. I've still got a ways to go, but I think that this book is very helpful<br /><br />On a 1 to 5 scale, 5 being the best:<br /><br />Readability: 5 The late Blake Snyder certainly can write and simplify things. This was easy to understand and read. A great read by all measures.<br /><br />Information and new ideas: 5 I've read a number of books on screenwriting, [[ASIN:0385339038 Screenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting]], [[ASIN:0671252305 The Craft of the Screenwriter]], and [[ASIN:1879505843 The Screenwriter's Bible: A Complete Guide to Writing, Formatting, and Selling Your Script]]. All are good books, but I felt that there were a number of new ways to think about how to write a screenplay that were presented by Snyder.<br /><br />Applicable Ideas: 5 With a new way to look at screenwriting I found many new ideas in this book. Not that the other books were bad, this one was in a form that I could understand better.<br /><br />Value: 5 Definitely. Because of everything I've said this is a must for screenwriters.<br /><br />I give it a 5 overall. Good reading and great applicable ideas. Also, a different style which worked better for me. (Remember that this was my opinion.)<br /><br />Great job Blake, I'm sorry to see you go.<br /><br />Rip Walker<br />Author: [[ASIN:1449595545 Rip's Book of Common Sense Selling: Improving Sales Through Process Implementation]]
B001AQR3E4|4.0|Bravo to all of the reviewers who took on the film in depth regarding characters and development in detail. The plot itself is pretty much as described on the back of the box--200 year old vampire telling his life story to a reporter he meets in a back alley, from the beginning (which is not quite how the book does it, but I digress) in which he describes the circumstances of his mortal life briefly, his transformation into a vampire by Lestat (Tom Cruise), and his internal struggles with what he has become. That is the overall gist of the story.<br /><br />In any case, to review the Blu Ray: I own the Dvd version of this, and bought the blu-ray to further my attempts at converting over my movie collection. The Blu-Ray is a bit sharper than the dvd, as to be expected, but I was not dazzled. I saw no immediate difference, but was satisfied with what difference there was, as this is an older movie. However: if you're looking for special features: don't.  Because this blu-ray does not really have them. There are commentaries from the actors, Anne Rice, etc, but I'm positive those are on the old Dvd as well. Nothing new here! It's kind of disappointing, because I buy Blu-Rays because I want to re-experience certain movies, and with no new content, there are no new angles to look at. In that sense, I'm disappointed.

B00288KNL8|3.0|\\"Coraline\\" is a hanselly-gretelly tale of a preteen girl discovering that perfect parents and an egocentric world is not reality, leaving something to be grateful for in that imperfect-but-true family. Reminiscent of Henry Selick's other films like \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" in the sewing of buttons and body parts of dolls, it's not as dark as Gil Kenan's \\"Monster House,\\" but still has that eery, juvenile flavor. The soundtrack music in \\"Coraline\\" is beautiful and stirring. One of the key characters, though unrecognized at first, is the clever and shifty black cat.
B001PHTPDU|5.0|Do not fail to read Naomi Klein's book, The Shock Doctrine\\", the clearest, best documented explanation of America's long standing,  vicious foreign policy yet written.  Other books on this sad attack by the US on developing nations note the obvious that unfettered free market economics ala the late Milton Friedman produces disastrous conditions for the masses where tried and can only be put in place under dictatorships which use brutal repression.  What are the 3 main prescriptions of the Friedman technique:  Privatization, deregulation, and cutbacks in social welfare spending, a triple play which clearly on the record does not produce real democracy, in fact, as history proves  the results are exactly the opposite.<br /><br />However, Klein's investigative reporting is the best on America's empire building activities which I have read so far.<br /><br />The US government, the IMF and rich multinationals installed what she calls \\"shock capitalism\\" everywhere a crisis could be found or created in these countries.  Examples include Chile, Russia under Yeltsin, and many other hapless countries which were caught in this largely US spun spider web. Klein tells how the greedy corporate elites here, the same ones who have bought and now control our government,  are well along in the process of doing it to us in the USA!<br /><br />Please, Citizens, understand that what our corporate elites and the government they now control are using techniques which strongly remind us of what was done overseas.  How does importing cheap labor we don't need help our working and Middle Class families?  Of course it only helps employers of cheap labor and the ideo and ethnic lobbies which want more and more.<br /><br />By exporting our technology to cheap labor countries, we have eroded our manufacturing base, but these multinationals make even more profits, which are protected to the wealthiest among us by tax laws passed by the Congress and sighed by Bush.<br /><br />Of course a long standing ploy of the neo conservative crowd has been the push to steal public assets via privatization<br /><br />All these devices are focused on bringing untold riches to our elites, trying in our treasured democracy to crush the spirit of the Middle and working classes which have made this democracy great.<br /><br />It is simply a different version of the \\"Shock Doctrine\\", tailored to fit, abuse and obliterate our democracy.<br /><br />The belief that unfettered capitalism brings real democracy which Milton Friedman sold long ago to top US policy makers in both parties and the corporate elites which support them did not prove true in the multiple cases where his programs were tried. Ramming it into numerous developing countries on the wings of various crises (e.g. craftily planned and engineered shocks like the Iraq War) allowed US firms and elite insiders in the countries where it was tried to steal public assets and destroy the laws and institutions of many governments.  Horrifying stuff, Folks.<br /><br />So far Obama has shown no signs of bringing this situation to a halt, and in fact is keeping our troops in the Middle East, aggravating the situation,  but certainly pleasing the hard right neo conservatives who have led the stealing here and abroad.<br /><br />Unfettered Capitalism Brings Tyranny Not Democracy.e crowd has been the push to steal public assets via privatization    All these devices are focused on bringing untold riches to our elites, trying in our treasured democracy to crush the spirit of the Middle and working classes which have made this democracy great.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|Short:    Pros:   * Quality construction  * Very comfortable to wear for extended periods  * Good surround sound quality -- could differentiate between hostiles coming up behind me and hostiles coming up from behind but a little to the left. :)  * Awesome range, works all over my apartment.  * Boom mic is easily positioned  * The Xbox 360 microphone cord is sturdy. Has only come out once.  * Built-in chat volume boost works wonders.    Cons:  * The hisses and pops you'll hear from time to time are infrequent, but they are *VERY* loud.  * There is no audible battery-low indicator. Just had the headsets shut off without warning while gaming with some tight friends. Supposedly the turtle beach logo flashes or something when the batteries are low, but that doesn't help when I'm wearing the headset...  * Cannot \\"blindly\\" put the Xbox 360 microphone cord in once its been jerked out while wearing the headset. Have to take the thing off to actually find the hole.  * Battery life is awful (with rechargeables, anyway). I get about 8-10ish hours. Would rather have had a built-in rechargeable battery and paid more for it. That way it'd always be charged.    Notes:    Make sure to turn the volume on your TV down or mute it. If you leave it on, and you can hear the TV speakers even slightly, it'll mess with your sense of perception.    Replaced my existing corded surround sound system with this -- it's great because I can use them late into the night watching movies without disturbing the apartment neighbours.

B002JIOQCO|5.0|Wolfmother, the Australian wonder down under have done what few bands accomplish--outdo a critically acclaimed breakthrough album while surviving an almost complete change in lineup. Originally a trio comprising vocalist and guitarist Andrew Stockdale, bassist and keyboardist Chris Ross and drummer Myles Heskett, the band released their debut self-titled album in 2005, and reached number three on the Australian ARIA Albums Chart. Yet, despite all of the acclaim, the cd lacked any real depth or ingenuity and while \\"Woman\\" was a capable song it did not hold the weight of all the other tunes surrounding it. They were on the path many have traveled of being a one hit wonder or at best turning out cds that would never reach the acclaim their debut did.<br /><br />However, lead singer Stockdale apparently had other ideas that have thankfully given way to the Wolfmother cd that should have been released to begin with.<br /><br />After some co-founding members left the band due to \\"irreconcilable personal and musical differences,\\" Stockdale reformed the band with new members, exactly what Wolfmother needed not to become a one hit wonder resting on its laurels. Enter \\"Cosmic Egg\\" and a new breed of rock for Wolfmother that has indeed hatched.<br /><br />Echoing equal parts Hendrix, Who, Uriah Heep, that gives the songs a rock, aluminum (not quite metal) and psychedelic feel; \\"Cosmic Egg\\" grabs you by the jugular with \\"California Rising\\" and throttles you with uncompromising, swagger and too-tight-jeans swagger for twelve tracks.<br /><br />It may have taken four years and a few goodbyes but \\"Cosmic Egg\\" highlights what Wolfmother can really be--a tight fisted, rock band with no apologies and no fears. Cosmic? Sure. Celestial ? Most definitely.<br /><br />Kim Thore<br />5 Stars<br /><br />[...]
B0026P3G12|4.0|Purchased I Dreamed A Dream (Susan Boyle) for a family member as a Christmas  gift. The CD was well received. The only comment was that  the CD consisted of slow ballards which included her famous \\"I Dreamed a Dream.,  plus other selections of music on the CD.
1400096936|4.0|Don Winslow must be a fan of James Ellroy; this book reminded me of the latter's 'American Tabloid'. I like authors who tackle big topics. I'm not so keen on the infantile leftist geopolitics which repeatedly appears in this book - the CIA may be an incompetent steward of 'The War On Drugs', but did Vice President Bush really sanction drug running into the US in order to raise money for anti-communist guerillas? Why are Latin American death squads always \\"right-wing\\"? And why is NAFTA bad? A more thoughtful author could have woven a more intriguing geopolitical context.    This said, the book kept me interested right up to the blood-soaked ending. There's a grisly fascination in discovering the fate of the narco cowboys and their associates, and in finding out what becomes of the few \\"good\\" characters. I reckon I'll be reading a few more Winslow books.
031606792X|2.0|Breaking Dawn was a letdown. The other reviewers have enumerated it's many problems so I'll try not to rehash. What's weird is that the preview of Midnight Sun feels so much more like the other Twilight books than BD (and it seems great so far!)    Did she really write this one??!! The feeling is so off...perhaps it was a rush job?     One of my greatest disappointments w/ BD was the neutered honeymoon sex in comparison to the grand guignol bloody mess of the pregnancy and birth.     Sex *and* Gore ? Sure! (I love Clive Barker)     ...but just gore alone after books of romance & yearning????!!! So not fair. :<    I hope Midnight Sun is much sexier!
1416972242|5.0|What would you do if the worst person in the world was your parent? Valentine Morgenstern is bent on destroying the Clave--the Shadowhunter's arm of the Law--and ridding the world of Downworlders--the demons (or half-demons) that Shadowhunters are sworn to hunt if they threaten human lives. Valentine already has The Mortal Cup. Will stealing The Soul Sword bring Valentine closer to his goal? Sure, some innocent people might get in the way, but what's a little collateral damage when you want to remake the world in your own vision?<br /><br />Clary and Jace are not bad people. Yes, they might be in love. Even if they are sister and brother. But that doesn't mean they're destined to follow in their father's footsteps, does it?<br /><br />Clary wishes she could turn her back on the secret world of the Shadowhunters and return to a normal life with her best friend. But nothing is normal for Clary, not while her mother lies in the hospital in a coma.<br /><br />Jace meanwhile tries to drown out his troubles by hunting and alienating the people he cares about. The only problem is, the alienation part isn't that hard when no one he cares about seems to trust him anymore. Instead of seeing the Jace they knew, it seems like everyone sees Valentine's son lying in wait to betray them.<br /><br />Will Jace be able to prove he isn't his father's son? Will Clary's mother wake up? And what about the Downworlder children being murdered throughout New York City?Find out in City of Ashes (2008) by Cassandra Clare.<br /><br />City of Ashes picks up soon after the first book in The Mortal Instruments series (City of Bones). Clare goes over the key past events without excessive rehashing. It is likely that this book would even stand on its own although readers will miss out on a lot of the fun if they skip the first book.<br /><br />This book offers more introspection for all of the characters. Clare shifts viewpoints between several principal characters offering a wider view of events and the world Clare has build. Readers also get a wider view of the characters themselves. Jace in particular is fleshed out a lot in this book.<br /><br />Then, of course, there is the star-crossed romance aspect as Clary and Jace struggle to move past their impossible feelings for each other as they try to understand what it really means to just be brother and sister. It might seem like a strange situation to add to a story, but Clare handles it tastefully and well enough that it's easy to bear with her for the length of the book (and the rest of the series) to see where things will lead.<br /><br />City of Ashes is as action-packed as its predecessor but with more character and world development. Clare has created another gripping, enjoyable read sure to dazzle.<br /><br />Possible Pairings: The Demon's Lexicon by Sarah Rees Brennan, The Inferno by Dante, The Mill on the Floss by George Eliot, How I Live Now by Meg Rosoff, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by J.

0553374842|4.0|I remember loving this book as a kid. The pictures were great and the backstories well thought out. I wish they had updated it for the prequel trilogies, but I guess they haven't.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|Prior to owning this director's cut, I had only seen the theatrical version. At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984, back when the theatre was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.<br /><br />This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.<br /><br />The director's cut adds some additional scenes that flesh out the motivations for the characters, and you would think that this adds to the film, but actually it detracts from it. I rather liked imagining what went on between the characters and having some of the sexual situations and conflicts insinuated and largely left up to the imagination of the viewer. This is all stripped away with the director's cut. Also, as unsavory a character as Salieri was, the extra scenes make him even more unlikable, and in a way that I thought was even beneath of what he was capable. I would elaborate, but I would give away key plot points.<br /><br />The commentary is the same as what was on the previous director's cut standard DVD, and to tell you the truth, the pair doing the commentary did not take the film seriously at all, which surprised me since one of the commenters is director Milos Forman. The comments were often completely distracting from the film's atmosphere, although they were well informed in their narrative. The other major extra, the \\"Making Of\\" documentary was quite enjoyable, and was also previously available on the standard DVD release of the director's cut.<br /><br />The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness,  and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. I highly recommend the film, and if you never saw the theatrical cut I doubt you will be bothered by the added material of the director's cut.eath of what he was capable.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This movie is really fun, with great songs, and it's clear they really had fun making it. The commentaries are at least as funny as the original movie, and the we really like the movie.    We've watched it several times already and we've only owned it a couple of weeks.
9113020730|5.0|It really is a great book and almost impossible to put down. I found it a more satisfying read than Fire, as Fire was built as the prelude to this and seemed to abruptly halt, as though Larsson had torn 1200 pages into two. Hornet's ties the end together so well, and 'trial' is particulalry well written.<br />Never reading another book from Larsson is sobering.............he really was that good.
B000TSIK14|4.0|Being a fan of the Scorps in all their wailing glory of the 1980's, I was pleasanly surprised with this latest offering. There is some heaviness to it at times but their sound has definitely mellowed over the years taking on a more modern contemporary tone in a vein very similar to a band like Fuel. Klaus Meine still has the pipes but his \\"sting\\" isn't as potent as he tones it down a bit here. There isn't a bad song in the lot and it definitely grows on you the more you listen to it.
0316069906|5.0|First of all, I would like to give sincere thanks to the author. It is a well written book about a difficult subject that I thoroughly enjoyed reading. While I am familiar with struggles of land animals used for human consumption, I wasn't very knowledgeable about the toll that fishing and fish farming takes on the fish and their environment. I think the Jonathan Foer did a great job discussing the ethical aspects of consuming animals. It was very interesting to read the perspective of Nimans and other more humane farmers right next to perspectives of advocates of veg*anism. I appreciate him analyzing Michael Pollan's arguments for continuing to consume meat. That whole chapter in his Omnivore's Dilemma left a bad aftertaste and it was nice to see that I was not the only one seeing something seriously wrong with his assertions.<br /><br />In the world that we live in, it is extremely important to be informed about the choices that we are making about our food. We are presented with many choices and that choice certainly matters. Now, I will step to the side of the people advocating for animal rights and stick to a vegan diet because it just makes sense...
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is one of those once in a while albums that comes along where you love the whole thing and it marks whatever time period you discovered it during as a positive, warm time. The album harkens you to a time when everyone was welcome, you knew your neighbor and one more was always welcome for dinner. The sounds are as good as the best home cooking and it makes a great soundtrack for long rides on snowboarding trips! Everyone in my car asked who was playing and the title of the album which leads me to believe that they've gone out and bought it as well.
0765356139|5.0|The Mistborn trilogy is perhaps the best tale I have ever heard or read. The plot goes smoothly, and connects amazingly throughout the whole trilogy. The characters each become a personal friend or enemy to the reader, and the details make the reader feel like they are actually there, in the book. The story has many astonishing (yet logical) twists. Each book left me ecstatic, and the last book left me sobbing tears of happiness and sorrow. (Yes, SOBBING. I am an emotional person, but still... for a book to invoke those feelings... WOW.) I recommend this book to any true reader; there is action, politics (not much, though), romance, and everything that makes a wonderful book. Easy 5 out of 5.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Best movie I've seen, ever! Combines Sci-fi, fantasy, war, dragons, little blue men that are 10 feet tall and a living planet that wakes up!  A love story too.

0307269760|3.0|Alice Munro uses great skill to bring characters to life quickly within the constraints of the short story genre. Her latest collection of ten stories titled, Too Much Happiness, displays that skill. No two stories are quite alike, and yet each one describes relationships and behavior that every reader will recognize as being alive and real. I recommend reading one story at a time and setting the book aside for a while. The title story is quite different from the others, and is taken from a true historical figure.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)

0321525655|5.0|Early on Garr Reynolds states that Presentation Zen describes an approach not a method. He succeeds in pointing us in the right direction, but leaves us with a great deal of work to do on our own. In my mind, that's okay.<br /><br />One strength of the book is an eclectic reading list scattered throughout the book. We're given a roadmap to go deeper, an interesting on at that. Another is slide examples. The strongest pages include side-by-sides of weak slides and their more powerful redesigns. Don't do that. Do this. In the past I've found examples such as these to be a great way to learn (for desktop publishing see The Makeover Book by Roger Parker). One develops intuition once many sets have been studied. Still, I would like to have seen more of these in PZ.<br /><br />There are many important themes in the book. Comics and storytelling are the mediums to emulate. People want to hear \\"the story\\" of your facts. Clarity, simplicity and length are some of the other important themes. [...] Can you strip your presentation down to its essence?<br /><br />A critical reader review mentioned pushing product. I didn't sense that. What I saw was documenting sources. Another suggested it was sparse. I think Presentation Zen is true to its title. We're given the framework and the resources, then the rest is up to us. Given our diverse needs, I think this a reasonable approach.<br /><br />Reading The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs and Presentation Zen will help anyone put distance between new presentations and the dense \\"slideuments\\" of the past.<br /><br />--Jack H. Bender, author of [[ASIN:0977827275 Disregarded: Transforming the School and Workplace through Deep Respect and Courage]]
0810982862|2.0|Like other people have said, this book is really thin. Lots of it is pictures of the machines, which aren't my thing, but I understand people love machines, so that's fine. However, this can't be close to what was created in the time it took to make this movie. It's more finalized pieces of art that match what the movie showed rather than what led up to the finished designs. Really disappointing, and I hope they make a new book with more art.    That said, the quality of the art in this book is beautiful and amazing. I looked through it at the bookstore and will be buying it when it sells for under $10.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|We saw UP in the theater and loved it.  The Blu-Ray serves it proud.  playing this movie on our Panasonic Plasma it looked nothing shy of breathtaking.  We love the fact that it came with the non BR discs as well, allowing us to watch on our portable DVD.
B000UPGQQW|1.0|Buyer beware!  This is a copy of the 1998 edition if the film.  The 2004 Special Edition was given a superior transfer with loads of extras.  Since this was issued in 2007, one could assume that this is a single disc version of the 2004 release. However, this is the original transfer with the bare-bones presentation of the original DVD.  Spend a few dollars more on the Special Edition DVD or the Blu-Ray.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I remember buying the orginal LIB album when I was a kid when it was first released in 1970.  I liked a few songs, but after Abbey Road it seemed kinda rough and a little bit of a letdown.  But, keep in mind, Abbey Road is my favorite album of alltime!    Having the Spector sound removed and the sonics cleaned up really did Naked justice.  I can't be more impressed now.  I have been listening to Naked for hours tonight and had to write a review.  I went back and listened to the LIB cd released in the late '80s and it really is night and day.  What had seemed possibly outdated on some songs due to the Spector sound, now seems fresh and more hard edged rock and roll, the way the Beatles intended from what I have read.    Sonically, the mastering is fantastic.  All the little details pop out and the separation is terrific.  The little guitar riffs really stand out and the bass and drums really pop.  The vocals have never sounded better.  Paul's voice really shines on his songs and really shows off how great a voice he had, especially on The Long and Winding Road.  Just a beautiful song as it is here, without all the orchestration.    If I had one bone to pick, it would be this version of Let It Be, the song.  While I really like the way it is done, I do miss the nice harder edge guitar solo and the last verse from the other version.    With all this said, I have yet to hear the new Remastered Let It Be cd, so I cannot compare the sonic differences.  The sonics were so great on Naked over the original LIB, so I would love to hear the new remastered LIB to see how it turned out.

B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles \\"White Album\\" is without doubt the group's most varied album, and this not just because it is a double album. The four members had around 1967-68 increasingly begun to work individually, more or less, at least to a certain extent, using the other members as musicians on their own songs.<br /><br />This, of course, meant that the members had greater opportunity to explore the musical genres they each found interesting, and this album is a clear expression of far their musical interests ranged.<br /><br />Oddly enough this multifaceted album comes out as a coherent whole, which must be due to the exceptionally fine musical talents of  producer George Martin and the four band-members.<br /><br />Were people given the opportunity to  pick out 12-14 numbers from the record for a single album with 35-40 minutes playing time, which was very common in these years, the result could be extraordinary different. Maybe it would progressive rock album, perhaps an almost psychedelic album, a standard pop album or maybe easy listening ballads album - of course depending of how the songs were chosen.<br /><br />How about an album consisting of \\"Glass Onion\\", \\"I'm So Tired,\\" \\"Birthday,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weep,\\" \\"Happiness is a Warm Gun,\\" \\"Revolution 1\\", \\"Yer Blues,\\" \\" Everybody's Got Something to Hide \\",\\" Sexy Sadie, \\"\\" Back in the USSR, \\"\\" Dear Prudence, \\"\\" Helter Skelter \\",\\" Piggies \\"and\\" Cry Baby Cry \\"? 14 titles and playing time 44.45. This would really be classic progressive rock album with elements of psychedlia. The album as it is none the less a classic - only the category will be somewhat different. In any event, an excellent album that it's hard to tire of - there will be a song for any mood.<br /><br />As it probably shows from my selected 14 numbers, Lennon is my clear favorite, but it must be acknowledged that McCartney also comes out very strong on this album - vocally of course but not least with his songwriting which is incredibly varied and inspired.

B002XTBE6K|4.0|I really, really enjoyed this version of Emma, although there were a few aspects of it that I didn't really agree with. First, the good! JLMiller's Knightley is my favorite by far! He's not too wishy-washy, not too stern - he finds a perfect balance between boyish charm and firm, quiet manly goodness :). I thought Romola Garai was quite good as Emma as well, although at times I was a bit put off by her slightly modern mannerisms. Almost everyone else was really well cast - I especially appreciated that Ms. Bates wasn't portrayed as a complete fool (in the other films she seemed more like a caricature than a character to me).   Now the bad: Emma's modern mannerisms. Things like plopping down on sofas, and generally being a bit lacking in the grace department. If she thought so highly of herself, it seems to me she would have been a bit more self-aware.   Also, Mr. Woodhouse. He was just depressing. In the book he's portrayed as a lovable, slightly silly, worried old man, and I really thought Michael Gambon would do a really good job playing him, but I felt that his performance fell rather flat. I just felt uneasy and depressed watching him.  The last aspect I have an issue with is the script. It's a great script, but I would really like to have seen more of Jane Austen's witty dialogue in there. The script seems to rely a little too heavily on new ideas of humor, or to leave it out altogether. I just don't understand why more of Austen's subtle humor couldn't be included.  That said, overall I thought it was a really good adaptation, with a (mostly) spot-on cast, great acting, decent script, beautiful sets and costumes, and a lovely score. Oh, and I haven't mentioned the best part - people play the piano and sing, and it actually sounds like they're singing! There's no sudden prima-donna-on-a-sound-stage moment. That is a thing of beauty rarely experienced in most period movies. Five stars for that, minus one for slight character and script flaws.
B0018O4YSQ|3.0|May have been leading edge in its time but dated by today's standards.  Kiefer Sutherland badly cast.  Interesting to see Jennifer Connelly at a young age.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I must say, I've always been a fan of Jillian, so I bought this dvd hoping that it would do exactly what she said. I would work out to this dvd and shred pounds in 30 days. The dvd lasts about 18-20 minutes, I thought, yeah I can do that, and I'm guaranteed results. All I have to do is do it.    I worked out EVERDAY to this dvd for 10 days straight, and though I had way more energy, that's about all it did for me. I did NOT lose one pound; I, infact, gained weight, and I was watching everything I ate.    Another thing that happened, as one other reviewer said, I totally started feeling like I had wiplash or something. By the tenth day I literally could hardly move. Days before this I started feeling very stiff and sore and thought I may have been coming down with something, but I continued my workouts, only to get worse. By the 10th day, I finally started to think it was this workout that was making me feel this way. So I stopped it for 2 days and sure enough went back to losing weight and wasn't sore or stiff anymore.    Maybe it was just me and a few others that that happened to. Try it if you want, but I didn't see any major results, and I'm just thankful that I wasn't severly injured and that everything went back to normal.    Another Pro: By the time you start to tire, you're more than half way through, so it's very easy to get through this workout with no excuse. That's why I liked it. I knew it didn't last very long; therefore I was easily motivated everyday to do it, unlike some other workouts.    Wish it hadn't made me stiff and sore and it would've worked for me. Good luck to you!
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I found this movie quite surprising for a number of reasons.  Initially I was kinda pissed at Tarantino, assuming he had jumped on the remake bandwagon by redoing Enzo Castellari's Italian war flick, Inglorious Bastards.  Thankfully, Tarantino didn't go that route.  Aside from the catchy(slightly altered) title, and the film being set during WWII, Tarantino's film has practically nothing to do with Castellari's film.  So that was a(pleasant)surprise.  Lots of folks hated this film.  Though I think many people know what to expect from Tarantino at this point, many folks still felt let down by this one.  I can only imagine that the modern filmgoer, who requires stimulation and action every two minutes or they get bored, was put off by the fact that this had little onscreen warefare action.  I can only imagine people were expecting two and a half hours of relentless Saving Private Ryan-type action.  Nope, doesn't happen.  Instead they got....uh oh....a plot that actually took it's time to unfold!  Imagine that nonsense!  Strike one.  Also, Brad Pitt is the star power, but people found that he doesn't have much screen time, and instead, much of the screen time is devoted to relatively unknown actors.  Personally, I thought this was great coz I don't care for Brad Pitt and I'm not sure how I would have responded to 150 minutes of his mug in every frame.  Strike two for all those Pitt fans who went to see it.  Then you got the dialogue.  Modern theatergoers can't stand dialogue driven films, and not only is this film dialogue driven to hell, but most of it is in subtitles!!  The one thing modern audiences hate more than Black and White film is subtitles!  Strike three.<br />Tarantino really pulled one over, didn't he?  He(God forbid)gave the film a slow, Sergio Leone type pacing(Tarantino always wears his influences on his sleeve, and Leone seems to be a big influence on this movie), he minimized the big Hollywood star's screen time and essentially made him a supporting character, and he had the Germans and the French speaking their native language.  Wow.<br />In a nutshell the plot is about a Jewish theater owner's plan to kill Hitler and many of the high ranking officials of the Nazi party when they all decide to attend a film premiere at her theater in 1944 Nazi occupied France.  Meanwhile, a small ragtag group of Jewish soldiers(\\"The Basterds\\") led by Brad Pitt and his brutal right hand man played by Eli Roth(just when I was beginning to think we'd finally started seeing the end of this guy), are on a rage fueled mission to kill and scalp as many Nazis as possible.  The \\"Basterds\\" also find out about the film premiere and hatch their own plan to destroy Hitler and his Reich.  There are a few minor subpots and characters, but everything serves as a buildup to the night of the film premiere.<br />Basically what Tarantino did here(as he pretty much does with all of his movies)is made an exploitation film masquerading as a Hollywood film.  From the title cards introducing/pointing out characters, the minimal(and pointless) use of a narrator(Samuel L. Jackson), anachronistic music that includes 70s style funk, over-the-top performances and characters(Pitt especally), graphic gratuitous violence, and a total disregard for factual history make this a big exploitation film in a very thin disguise.  I mean, come on, all bets are off when Mike Myers appears in a small role, I don't care if he is playing it serious.  I realize that exploiting the atrocities of WWII for the sake of movie entertainment seems to be in very bad taste, but hey, it worked for Ilsa: She Wolf of the SS, and what household in America doesn't own and cherish a copy of that movie?<br />Some flak aimed at this movie comes from the fact that Jews are all portrayed as bloodthirsty savages bent on revenge.  So what?  If the same characters had been Irish, nobody would be saying anything.  Violent revenge films have existed for many years and span countless film genres.There's really no point in reading into it all that deeply.  After all, this is a movie where Hitler walks out of the theater so he can ask the SS soldier standing guard for a piece of gum.<br />So, yeah, I thought this was a surprisingly good movie.  Sure it has it's faults.  It does suffer from a tad much of Tarantino's diarrhea of the mouth(though unlike the excruciating yammering of Death Proof, most of the dialogue here at least holds interest), and some scenes don't need to go on quite as long as they do, but for the mostpart I feel Tarantino succeeded in making his best film in quite a few years.no point in reading into it all that deeply.

0385504225|1.0|Dan Brown has had a very definite agenda in his last several books, one that is decidedly anti-Christian and pro-New Age.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is no exception, and in fact, is even more blatant in some ways than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\".  I'm actually surprised that some readers believed this book would not offend Christians and, furthermore, thought that its conclusion was an embrace of Christianity.    In truth, Brown deceptively tries to undermine basic Christian beliefs by taking Biblical scriptures out of context and saying they prove that we can be gods ourselves, if only we could harness the full potential of our minds.  This is a dangerous New Age belief that has nothing in common with Christianity.  He also states that all religions commonly share the same truth, which is that we can be gods, and that Armageddon is not the end of the world but rather a period of enlightenment in which we finally realize our potential to be god-like.    Christianity teaches us that there is only one God, who sent his Son Jesus (fully God and fully man) to save us from our sins because we can't save ourselves, and that the ONLY way to salvation is through a personal belief in and relationship with Jesus (John 3:16, John 14:6).  New Age believers want to convince us that all roads lead to Heaven, but God himself, through Scripture, says otherwise.     One additional point:  People have complained about the annoying plot device Brown uses repeatedly in which his protagonist, Robert Langdon, refuses to believe unlikely ideas or myths until a few pages later when they are always proven to be true.  While this device quickly becomes tedious, I think Brown may be using it for a more deceptive purpose:  If the protagonist, a well-educated intellectual, can be wrong about his religious beliefs, perhaps the reader will wonder if he or she might be also.  It is an overly amateurish concept and yet, perhaps through repetition, it is effective enough to actually cause some Christians to question their basic beliefs.  Don't let Dan Brown's New Age beliefs fool you.
0316069906|5.0|I think Jonathan Foer is a brilliant writer, which is why I bought Eating Animals days after it came out. I knew of course that it had something to do with the title, but I had no idea the depth of Foer's research. And that's the oddest thing about this book: it's Foer's quirky insights, his humor and hipness, his personal relationship to the material as in his novels, but EA is factual, not fictional.     I am particularly impressed with the way Foer dials back to the most conservative data and refrains from preaching; he just tells the story, or I should say he tells many stories interwoven with credible research, and describes his own soul-searching on the topic of eating animals. He leaves it totally up to you what you want to do. Very cool. And powerful.    But Foer's real brilliance in this book lies in his unstated but palpable comparison between his grandmother's young life spent in running from capture by the Nazis' mechanized killing of the Jews and Factory Farming's mechanized killing of animals. His descriptions of animals crammed together, starved, tortured, terrified and transported to their deaths in tightly packed train cars evokes  the horrendous images of concentration camp victims we have all seen. Perhaps this book is too her \\"revenge.\\"     I love meat, and I will never eat it again. Or fowl, or fish.     Thank you for writing this book. I wish I'd read it decades ago.
0451529308|5.0|When I was in the 7th grade, my mother gave me Little Women for Mother's Day from my dolls (yes, I still played with dolls in the 7th grade).  Reading it was a life altering experience. I remember reading parts of it to my mother in the kitchen while she was cooking dinner. When Beth died, tears poured down my mother's face and into the stew. Even though I am 62 now, I still remember how Jo gave me the desire to be a writer with a passion that still burns today. I ended up having 4 daughters myself, daughters whom my family refers to as my \\"Little Women.\\"  One of my girls even calls me \\"Marmee.\\"!  Jo inspired me to write St. James Place.

B00006HAZG|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW  This Masterpiece Theater treatment of Dickens' classic and most personal book \\"David Copperfield\\" boasts a cast which is nearly uniformly excellent. Bob Hoskins, Imelda Staunton, Maggie Smith, Ian McKellan, and a very young Daniel Radcliffe are only some of the gifted actors plying their trade to bring the classic story to life.  While casting is strong, the quality of the written adaptation suffers as it pares down Dickens' tome in all of the wrong places.  This is undoubtedly due to the production being a miniseries rather than a full-blown film.  Still, the demands of brevity which a miniseries imposes were met much more successfully in a 2005 rendering of \\"Bleak House,\\" another adaptation of a famously lengthy Dickens saga.  To give examples of storytelling shortcomings in this production, Uriah Heep is shorn of most of his storyline, though the magnetic oiliness of the character still comes through in a remarkable performance by Nicholas Lyndhurst.  Additionally, the Murdstones, who form a brilliant Alpha and Omega thematic line for David in the book are completely forgotten in the second half of this miniseries.  Also featuring a charming Ian MacNiece as the simpleminded and wise Mr. Dick, this production of \\"David Copperfield\\" retains a hearty intelligence which mostly overcomes a poorly adapted screenplay.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I attempted to see this movie while it was playing in the theater.  I had not walked out on a movie since 1972.  Maybe it was my frame of mind.  Although the story seemed compelling.  There were just too many \\"bodily fluids\\" in the movie.  I found it more of a gross-out than virtually every \\"slasher\\" film I have ever seen.  After sitting through about half the movie, I decided that this wasn't doing me any good and left.  If you can stomach the gore, it appeared to have a good underlying story.
0071636080|2.0|So, you want to know the Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs? Simple, really.<br /><br />First of all, you only give four presentations a year, at \\"Apple Events.\\"<br /><br />You do this in a packed hall of Apple acolytes, and members of the world's press who will give you a standing ovation for just showing up after being sick. They will all hang on your every word.<br /><br />You hand out the design details to slide producing companies. Have someone else actually advance the slides.<br /><br />You try to give the impression that Apple is anything but a marketing company masquerading as a tech company.<br /><br />You have a bunch of monitors facing you across the front of the stage, so you can see both what's on screen and your notes, without looking away.<br /><br />You run the presentation as a sales pitch, with a minimum of detail.<br /><br />As CEO, you are acutely conscious of saying anything that could lead to class action suits.<br /><br />So, is this sounding like the presentations you give? Me neither, and basing this book on the way one famous individual presents is pointless. You might as well tell the Presentation Secrets of U.S. Presidents. What the famous have to look out for is something wildly different than your presentation of the Third Quarter Sales Figures for the North East Region.<br /><br />Much of the information here is superfluous. If you're trying to sell something with your presentation, it's fine. However, there's little real advice for any other kind of presentation. If you're a school student or a pastor, a trial lawyer or a company pension fund administrator, you have to work for your audience.<br /><br />So why two stars? That's because the book points out some ideas that are often overlooked. It makes sense to limit your \\"take-home messages\\" to three. Many presentations blind you with dozens of facts without telling you which are important.<br /><br />Another point is to control your presentation. Lead into and out of different ideas, and make it clear if the presentation suddenly takes a turn to become more technical. There are plenty of ways we do this in normal conversation, and you will help your audience considerably if you adopt this method and not the \\"Here are the facts, sort them out for yourself\\" approach.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this book ends with the most useless advice given to presenters - \\"Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.\\" That means you spend endless hours trying to remember the words, and the ideas gradually become meaningless. Then you have to go out trying to remember whether you were supposed to start with \\"I'm happy to be here today,\\" or \\"It's good to see all of you here.\\"<br /><br />Instead, rehearse the Ideas. When you know that you don't have to recall your words, you can get worked up - enthusiastic, even - in the presentation. How often have you seen people mumble their way nervously through presentations? They seem obsessed with the need to say all the right words in the right places.<br /><br />But equally, how many times have you seen authors advocate producing picture-perfect graphically designed slides? Worse still, they suggest that you limit yourself to a certain number of slides - like one size fits all? At the end of a presentation, by far the most important metric is how well your message was understood, not by how nice the slides looked or how funny your jokes were. Graphic design is nice, but it is a minor complement to the actual message.<br /><br />Presentations have many different audiences needing many different messages to be effective. Let Steve Jobs smarmily introduce his overpriced products in his way, and use the best way for yourself.<br /><br />And if you think that Steve Jobs is the master of conflicting messages, remember that this book calls him the Tiger Woods of business. Oops!<br /><br />EDIT - Here's an example of how NOT to do it.<br /><br />In the launch of the iPad, Steve Jobs showed a slide of how much the iPad will cost. It is a classic of non-presentation design in a presentation.<br /><br />You'll find this on Gizmodo's site.

B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with this version of Pride and Prejudice. The director/writer (I don't know who) obviously felt that Jane Austen didn't write enough drama and \\"real\\" life into her book.  In a movie about a gentlemen and his wife who need to marry off 5 daughters within the limited confines of their small village, why is there a shot of a boar's testicles 5 minutes into the production?  It didn't add anything to the production and wasted time needed for the story.  Mr. Bennett was a gentlemen, so why didn't he ever shave?  Donald Sutherland just looked scruffy throughout the movie! The costumes were not true to any period in English history. If it was Georgian, all the ladies should have been wearing fitted to the waist dresses with full skirts, as Mrs. Bennett did.  Instead we get Lizzie in drab not quite high waisted (was it Empire?) dresses. Keira Knightly is flat chested and the Empire style of the time was very flattering to such a figure. Why was she not costumed well?  The dance scenes were chaotic.  These were assemblies and house parties held by and for the gentlemen's class, not the servants.  In this village and its surrounds there weren't that many people who would have been invited.  This wasn't Brighton or Bath at the height of the season! Just too much drama!  Lizzie out in the rain in the gazebo during her big confrontation with Mr. Darcy--where was that scene in the book? And people didn't travel very far in the dark!  So why on earth would Lady Catherine de Burg be calling on the Bennetts at midnight or later just to confront one of the daughters about her relationship with her nephew?  Lady Catherine de Burg was very strict on proper conduct and even enraged as she was, she would still have observed the proprieties. And where was Lydia's story?  This movie seemed to have been written by someone who hadn't read the original book and/or believed they could do a better job of telling the story!  The director/writer forgot that there weremany threads woven together to tell the story of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. And Lydia's elopement with a seducer was integral to getting Darcy and Lizzie together!  All in all a big disappointment!  And it could have been so much better!

032147404X|2.0|After 666 reviews not much I can say except this is not necessarily the right book to buy.    Take the time to read some of more negative but constructive comments.  Scott has lots of good ideas.  He also gives lots of ideas that are either outdated or wrong in the views of other top photographers.      Please, before buying this book take a little more time and review Bryan Peterson's series.  And there are others on the internet often free.      If I had never bought Scott Kelby's book (books) I could have saved money on better equipment choices and learned just as much or more with other photographer's books and internet videos.      Now I see Scott even has three volumes in CostCo.  At half price they are still not the best choice and go off on studio methods and others less useful methods.    Scott if your listening have a good laugh ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK.

B002PQ7JQK|1.0|First, I ordered this set on Walmart, not Amazon after selling my remastered DVD set.      I was SO excited to receive it!  Boy what a mistake!    First thing I noticed was that I could hear some disks moving inside the cases before opening it up.  One of the disks in season 2 was scratched because of being lose during shipping.     Then I popped in the first disk of the first season and began to watch.  Yes it's 4:3, but that was fine and the video was outstanding.    The bad part was when the first episode started, I noticed I had to turn up the sound quite a bit to hear them speak (this did not happen with the preview of Star Trek the movie, which comes on first)!  When I paused and switched back to the TV, I almost jumped off the couch because I had the volume so high to hear the episode!  So I went back in to see the audio settings on the disk.  It was set to DTS, so I switched it back to 2 speaker mono, but it was doing the same thing.  I skipped over a few more episodes and found the same problem.    After doing some research, I found this problem was popping up quite often.  I also noticed that Amazon stopped selling the first season on Blu Ray!  Go read the feeback there as well.    It is very cool to switch back and fourth on the old and new version, but when you go back to the old version during the theme song, they still took out the old theme song, which sounds WAY better than the new one they made.  The new version of the theme song is SO BAD!  The womans singing is very off time.  I mean, its so bad that it's funny.  The old way was so much better...what a shame.  I wonder what the heck they were thinking after recording that woman's voice...wish I could have been there in the studio to say \\"What the f#$% is that!\\".     So besides the defect with the audio, one scratched disk, the episode order and the very lame remake of the theme song, this was a good attempt to have the ultimate set of Star Trek.    All they need to do is get the audio right, havethe option to watch it in episode order and have the option to listen to the original theme song and this set will freakin' rock!    Right now, Paramount needs to re-release this, SOON!  I am missing my remastered set I sold right now \\"sniff\\"...well, not really.  I hated the way the disks were designed in those sets.    The good part was Walmart took it back without any problem...don't know how Amazon is handling it, but maybe you should call them before you buy it or do more research.    Big SHAME on Paramount for not getting this right.  I checked their website, but they have nothing to say on it.    Hey, maybe Star Wars should do the same thing with episodes 4, 5 and 6!  It would be great to see and hear the old Star Wars movies in their original raw format and switch to the new remastered version (although I prefer the grainy old ones).     Any comment or similar problems?

0375831002|5.0|Things that are terrifying or filled with sadness are not necessarily without beauty. The Book Thief is a story that exemplifies that principle. The characters are real and complex and the plot is captivating. But more than that, it's a book that shows the humanity of different individuals, while not shying away from the brutality of others.<br /><br />Using Death as the narrator adds another dimension to the novel. Nothing is new to Death, and yet he is moved and intrigued by this story and shares it with us, showing us the complexity of humanity.<br /><br />The Book Thief is the best contemporary young adult book I've read. I know some people feel it was wrongly marketed that way, but I think it fits the audience well, while not writing down to them. The voice and style are distinct enough to make it feel special, while the subject matter and characters are real enough to tell a great deal of truth about the human condition. It will be interesting to watch and see if it finds a place in school literature curricula. (9.5/10)
B002SQ364Q|3.0|Ok, this movies wasn't all boring.  It reminded me of an early 90s movie.  It was about how Woodstock came to be.  I'm not sure how much was truth and how much was made up.  I do know that they had some scenes that were based on pictures from the Woodstock festival.  So if you are interested in stuff like that, you will probably be happy.  I think one of the people that actually had something to do with Woodstock helped with the movie.  The movie is about the guy who was a big part of Woodstock actually happening.  How Woodstock was stopped, then thanks to him and his family, it still got to be what is was.<br /><br />I learned things that I never had any idea about before.  So for that, I'm happy.  It was a fun movie to watch.  Well at parts.  There were interesting parts, then out of no where, it would just drag on and on.  Seems like it could be amazing.  Only if they had written more stuff to keep you awake.  I know the movie wasn't about the music from Woodstock.  But I only heard a few songs.  Hopefully the soundtrack is better.  I guess you could just buy the Woodstock DVD though.  It's weird to think that something like Woodstock will probably never happen again. I mean, didn't people riot at the last Woodstock?  The music was a lot more heavy and I guess people just don't understand what the original was all about.  Wish I had been alive for the original.  If I were, and I had not been drafted.  I would have went and I'm sure loved it.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Monsters, Inc. is the largest scare factory in the monster world and the top kid Scarer is James \\"Sully\\" Sullivan, a huge intimidating monster with blue fur, large purple spots and horns. His Scare Assistant, best friend and roommate is Mike Wazowski, a lime green, opinionated, fiesty, one-eyed monster. Scaring children isn't such an easy job--monsters believe children are toxic and that direct contact with them would be catastrophic. Inside the factory can also be found the factory's crab-like CEO, the beguiling serpent-haired receptionist Celia and the sarcastic chameleon monster, Randall Boggs, who schemes to replace Sully as Monsters, Inc.'s top Scarer. Visiting from the human world is Boo, a tiny girl who turns the monster world upside-down. This movie is highly entertaining, funny and cheerful, high-energy, that kids and adults will enjoy.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I've been a Star Wars fan my whole life (I saw Empire Strikes Back in the theater when I was 3); seen all the movies, read many of the books until it got to be overkill (thumbs down Kevin J. Anderson!), etc.  I enjoyed the Gennedy Tartarovsky \\"Clone Wars\\" series, although I feel that series focused too much on the darker part of Anakin's personality, preventing him from being likable; I can understand the reason for this, because some people would have a hard time with him becoming Vader in Ep. III if he was really likeable, but he was supposed to be a great hero.  When the Clone Wars movie came out, I passed on it, but gave the series a try.      I haven't regretted it; the animation is excellent, with fluid movements and intense action scenes.  Many of the characters emote well and can be very lively, Mace Windu being one of the exceptions for some reason.  The battles are just as intense as the firefights and space battles from the original movies, with soldiers from both sides dying in large numbers and there being a lot of action.  The battle droids are humorous, and it has done a lot of development for all the characters; we see most of the Jedi  Council in action, Ahsoka grows up some, especially later on in the season where a battle costs her soldiers' lives.  Anakin is more of a daredevil warrior type, and comes off a lot more likeable than he does in the movies or GT's cartoon series, which I think fits better.  The half-flirty interactions between Obi-Wan and Ventress are interesting and a little unexpected, and General Grievous gets a pretty nice story arc that explains him and why he's now 90% droid; the interaction between Grievous and his \\"Doctor\\" were funny and I hope the Doctor shows up again.  The show also introduces one of the best new characters in the Star Wars Universe: bounty hunter Cad Bane.  This guy is great; from the moment he looks up from under his oversize hat and tells a Senate Guard \\"Son, I wouldn't be doing that.\\", you know you'rein for a very different type of underworld character that's effective, intimidating, and iconic.  Bane, far more than Ahsoka (who's ok, in an annoying teen sort of way), is the strongest character introduced so far, and hints at the darker future awaiting the galaxy.      Despite my enjoyment of the series, there are a few things I don't like, and some discrepancies from the movies.  Some might be addressed in the Clone Wars movie, which I haven't  seen, but here the issues are:    1.  While the lesson in the beginning of each episode is cute and reminds me of the ones at the end of many '80s cartoons, the newsreel is annoying.  The voice over for it is just way too overdramatic, which is a shame because it's the same guy who voices  the Admiral, who seems ok.    2.  Count Dooku - I think he continues to be shortchanged in the series like he did in the movie; for starters, he lacks the Christopher Lee elegance when we've seen him thus far.  In addition, the whole galaxy seems to know he's a  Sith Lord now.  Even the Jedi didn't know that at the end of Ep. II.  When did that happen, and if it did, why doesn't anyone, including Sidious, call him Darth Tyrannus?  In addition, in Ep. II, Dooku tried to win over Obi-Wan by indicating he wanted to destroy the Sith and reform the Republic, which is allegedly becoming very corrupt.  Did he decide \\"Ah heck, I'll just ditch that cover.\\"?  Because in the series he seems more focused on being sinister than anything else, and I think that removes the surface aspect of what the Clone Wars are about according to the movies and many of the books, which is the Separatists want to leave the Republic because it is corrupt and no longer governs well.      3.  Relates to #2 in, \\"what is the Separatist movement about?\\"  Like I stated before, the idea behind the Separatists are they want to leave the Republic because it has become corrupt and cannot run the galaxy, which gives Palpatine the excuse to gain more power and eventually transform the Republic into the Empire.  Based on the series, one would think the Separatists consist of 7 and a half (half being Grievous) living characters and a bunch of droids.  Ok, we know the head guys are greedy and evil, like the Viceroy and Grievous, but where's the Separatist viewpoint that leads Anakin to accuse Padme of sounding like a Separatist in Ep. III?  It would be interesting to see Separatists that aren't totally evil or see some obvious (Palpatine/Sidious isn't obvious) examples of Republic corruption in the series.       4.  Like a few others have complained, there is no indication of a friendship between Bail Organa and Obi-Wan Kenobi.            Overall though, I think the series is an excellent addition to the Star Wars universe and does a lot for connecting the bridge between Ep. II and Ep. III, and is enjoyable to watch.  I recommend it.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|I saw Paranormal Activity when it first came out and I have mixed reviews.   Watching it in the theater was a joke. I thought it would be a good experience to see it on the big screen but instead it turned into a scream fest amongst teen girls which was instigated by one clown over-exaggerating his own fear.  Half the time I couldn't even hear the movie or what the characters were saying.  If I had to do it all over again, I would have waited a month or so to see this at the movie theater, hoping by then the shock of the new movie would wear off on its viewers.    All that being said, at the time I didn't really find the movie frightening. There were a couple of parts that were creepy - like the parts where Katie would be standing over Michah staring at him for hours.  Or the noises coming from the stairs. Those things were creepy but not necessarily frightening........at the time.   What I didn't expect was to not be able to sleep without the hall light on for the next month!! My bedroom is upstairs and when I got home that night after the movies and every night afterwards, I thought of the movie before going to sleep and it freaked me out.  So I guess after all the movie did what it was supposed to do.  I'm now able to sleep with the lights off, but every once in a while I still look in to the dark hallway from my bed and I think of Paranormal Activity.  Creepy!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|A rat named Remy dreams of becoming a great French chef despite his family's wishes and the obvious problem of being a rat in a decidedly rodent-phobic profession. When fate places Remy in the sewers of Paris, he finds himself ideally situated beneath a restaurant made famous by his culinary hero, Auguste Gusteau. Despite the apparent dangers of being an unlikely - and certainly unwanted - visitor in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant, Remy's passion for cooking soon sets into motion a hilarious and exciting rat race that turns the culinary world of Paris upside down. A movie filled with delightful entertainment for kids and adults.
0143038419|5.0|Simply unputdownable. An joyful and life-affirming story of how one woman took her destiny into her own hands and turned her life around.Can't wait for the movie.
B00005JM02|5.0|Life along the Great Barrier Reef is full of dangers when you are a tiny clown fish. And for Marlin, a single parent determined to protect his only son Nemo, there are constant fears and anxieties. When, on his first day of school, Nemo defies his father and swims off alone to investigate a boat, he is suddenly scooped up by a diver as Marlin helplessly watches. Marlin turns desperate as he frantically swims off in search for his son. As he passes a school of fish he bumps into Dory, an agreeable blue tang with severe short-term memory loss, who offers to help. Together this aquatic odd couple set out on an impossible mission, finding themselves in troubled waters and contending with such hazards as sharks, deadly angler fishes and a forest of jellyfish. An engaging undersea story that your kids will find cool. A treat for everyone.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is one of those art house films that transfixes you on first viewing but that you never want to see again.  It is utterly horrifying to see these 4 people ruin their lives, each with their own drug nightmare.  But what is remarkable is the mood - the consistent feeling of losing control, of fear, of dying hope - that permeates every part of it.  The only kind of film to which I would compare it is a horror film, seen by a child:  you feel trapped within someone else's fantasy, unable to extricate yourself until it ends, but this is for adults with adult issues.  Yes, they are all losers in one way or another, yet you feel sympathy for them mixed with revulsion.<br /><br />It is a great movie, but I would recommend renting it to see, you won't want to watch it again.
B0029NY9YO|1.0|Naah, it was ok really. I managed past halfway.<br /><br />I don't understand why they make this sort of stuff. Who is the target audience? It can't be 10 year-olds, cos the action is not fast enough. And it can't be adults, cos it's utter nonsense.<br /><br />I can take a bit of superjunkism. Like I thoroughly enjoyed The Incredibles. But that one was funny with likeable characters. I even liked District 9, for some reason I could relate to the personal story, however farcical the setting. But this one is ridiculous without being funny. It takes itself way too seriously to be enjoyed by adults. And there is no personal story to relate to. The only remotely likeable character is Rorschach, but he's too one-dimensional to keep my interest for the whole movie.<br /><br />I wonder if I can get a refund from the video store. 3 out of 10.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|As a parent who has not read the books but watched the films with my kids more times than I can count, I was looking forward to this film.  They saw it in the theatre and were very critical of it as omitting so much that it made little sense and was not a good cinema experience.<br /><br />I think that their criticisms are essentially correct.  It was very difficult for me to understand what exactly was going on - there are many sequences that appear to have been filmed with the assumption that viewers had read the book.  What you get are the actors standing there, implying something significant yet explaining only the basics (e.g. the secret that the new character has in his mind, but not what the new character is doing when she forces Snape, with some ambivalence, to take the unbreakable oath).  That greatly lessens the enjoyment for casual viewers like myself.  Moreover, while there is plenty of action, there are many scenes are low key and quiet, with abrupt shifts to new scenes that are awkward from a storytelling point of view (e.g. Harry suddenly appears in Dumbledore's inner sanctum and they are working on memories stored in these vials).  At one point, the bad guys are in Hogwarts and they destroy some stuff and then that is all you hear from them - they just walk off.  It made little sense to me.<br /><br />One of the strengths of the film is the advancement of the characters' personal lives, as couples begin to form in young love.  This is quite fun and romantic.<br /><br />REcommended.  We have to follow this to the end, even peripherally interested parents like myself.  You must get it if HP is a part of the family interest/obsession, however weak this film is on its own.
B00005RYL9|3.0|Can anyone tell me what the track listing is for the cd that comes with this dvd? I'm a huge Queen fan and I've been looking for a complete version of Queen doing New York New York. Thanks in advance. I rated 3 stars because I don't know what this edition has, the movie has been and will always be 5 stars.
0743277708|5.0|In the author's note beginning this read, Adams states that he struggled to find a publisher, as the characters of bunnys was childish, whereas the storyline was very adult.<br /><br />And thats what I thought this book would be like. Well the storyline was very adult, kinda like Gulliver's travels. The main crew of rabbits travel the countryside and encounter trails and tribulations which (apparently unintentionally) are allegories for human society.<br /><br />The whole rabbit thing is done brillantly, from a rabbit's perspective the world is a dangerous and fascinating place, its a bit like a fantasy novel with supernatural creatures, except the creatures are of course dogs, foxes and human vehicles.<br /><br />As an older book Watership Down, does have a longer-winded feel about it, with lots of stories within the story and build-up to the final confrontation.<br /><br />I remember my first experience of this book was actually the movie (intially dismissed as a child's Animals of Farthing wood type thing) Then I happened to catch my younger brother watching towards the end, where there were rabbits totally tearing the s*** out of each other and brutality in all corners.<br /><br />Highly Recommended :)
B00275EGWY|3.0|Speechless! Tears flowing down my cheeks as the credits rolled! Could this cinematic MASTERPIECE have been made by someone from our own wretched planet? I think not. Kathryn Bigelow MUST have come to us from an extrasolar location, with directing talent dripping from her wings when she entered our atmosphere! As I watched The Hurt Locker, I kept thinking, \\"How can one director take so many individual segments of pure fiction and have the masses falling all over themselves with glowing admiration for the 'authenticity' of this film?\\" Just truly AMAZING! Most of the time even average buffoons who've never even been close to a war zone can smell a war movie's fake and contrived nature...But not so with The Hurt Locker!    There are those who LOVE the Iraqi setting (but don't tell them the movie wasn't even filmed in Iraq, OK?). And this movie made me want to join the US Army! I mean, I've always liked shooting Barrett .50 cals in video games and Bigelow shows us you can be a \\"former intelligence\\" soldier, a current member of an elite EOD team and just pick up a spare Barrett M107 lying around and start picking off bad guys at nearly 1,000 meters...Even a MOVING target! And to think I've been wasting so much time at the range to improve my skills!?!    I was also unaware that the Army had relaxed their \\"rules\\" so much while in a war zone...Because Bigelow again shows us how you can sneak around in a hoodie, put a pistol to an Iraqi civilian's temple and have him drive you all around Baghdad for FREE (well, like I said before, it's not REALLY Baghdad you know). This has GOT to be saving our brave soldiers a small fortune in Taxi fares! And once you see a home you like, just hop out and walk right in to someone's residence (weapon drawn) and have a look around. I'm sure they won't mind if you take a few things with you before you casually stroll back to the gate of the Base (did I mention this is supposed to be a WAR ZONE Base?). Heck, you don't even get in trouble anymore for leaving the base without a pass and you'll be right back on the job the next day!    Don't like the plywood nailed up over the windows? Just tear it down so you can enjoy a little sunshine with your mortar shrapnel! Bored? Just grab your buddies and hop in the Humvee and cruise around the beautiful Iraqi countryside (well, not really IRAQI countryside). I also like how you can be given orders to investigate an explosion, but you and your buddies can grab your assault rifles and start going through the city streets \\"looking for bad guys to blow away\\"...That's sounds so much better than a stupid video game! Just grab your M4A1 and go hunting for LIVE targets!! I mean, you're in a foreign country so nobody's gonna care if you mow down a few of the locals in the dead of night for some cheap thrills, right? Bigelow shows us this is how our soldiers respond to orders in \\"THE NEW US ARMY\\".    Bigelow made sure I was NEVER worried about the safety of this EOD Team! Sgt James, the lead bomb tech, is nothing short of a Superhero! He's diffused, what, some 873 explosive devices? And he STILL has all of his digits? He also keeps a piece of each one under his bunk. (I hope I'm not being too picky here, but pieces of 873 bombs would probably take up HALF of the room these guys live in, don't you think?) Sgt James doesn't even CARE if he blows up! He walks up to a flaming car filled with live shells and casually uses ONE fire extinguisher to douse the flames in about 15 seconds. Then he removes ALL of his protective gear and begins grabbing the smoldering steel while slicing and ripping into the car's interior with a pocket knife, not even concerned about triggering an explosion...And why should he be with 873 under his belt? He even stands in the center of a spider IED and yanks the wires right up out of the ground! He walks up to a potential car bomber and puts a pistol to his temple (he's really good at that you know). He uses his x-ray vision to...Wait a minute. Sorry, that's Superman isn't it? In fact, the only time Sgt James fails to diffuse, none of his buddies are hurt. It's the innocent psuedo-Iraqi guy who's blown to smithereens!    This Sgt James guy don't take nothing from nobody! When he gets tired of communicating with his team members, he just turns his radio off. He deploys a smoke grenade as a \\"distraction\\" so his team can't watch him do his magic. Later, a couple of bad guys are carrying off his buddy and he just opens up on ALL of them with his trusty assault rifle! Of course his buddy takes one in the leg that shatters his femur, but he'll be (kind of) up and walking in a few months...maybe. There's no inquiry as to WHY his buddy is crawling around with one of Sgt James' rounds in his leg. There's no inquiry as to WHY they disobeyed orders and were doing a little recreational night hunting on the streets of Baghdad. I always thought they Court Martialed soldiers for stuff like that. Bigelow show us not anymore...This is \\"THE NEW US ARMY\\" where there's no longer a need for any intrusive Chain of Command!    Finally, I'd always been led to believe that soldiers killed in war died horrible deaths. Silly me! Bigelow shows how today's soldier can take a sniper bullet right through the chest and DIE in a beautiful 360 degree dive with a half-twist that looks like it was choreographed by none other than Paula Abdul herself...Simply a spiritual experience!!     Since I have no life to speak of, I must watch The Hurt Locker again and again and again just soaking in the awesome beauty and truth that allowed me to forget about my own pitiful life and instead transcend the Earthly boundaries that usually restrict mere mortals from becoming something much, much more...I only regret my mouse-induced failure to give this movie a full 5-stars on Amazon. If I blindly give everything I review 5-stars, then everyone will give me \\"helpful\\" votes and I'll be invited to join the exclusive Amazon Vine community of reviewers. My mistake, huh?
B002RSDW80|4.0|This is absolutely a cute and refreshing movie.  It's clean and fun.  I remember growing up watching Julia Child on T.V. as a child.  She helped me learn to love to cook.  This is a movie that I would show anyone.  The correlation of the two lives and how cooking help them get through tough times in their lives. This is a movie I wouldn't be embarrassed to watch with my grandmother.  The actresses did a great job in their character portrayls.  I would highly recommend this movie, it's a just a plain, good movie.
B001CU1RRW|5.0|This is probably the best collection of Springsteen's music up to the early 2000s. The tracks not listed on the Amazon page (at this time) are:<br /><br />CD 3<br />1 From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come)<br />2 The Big Payback<br />3 Held up without a Gun<br />4 Trapped<br />5 None but the Brave<br />6 Missing<br />7 Lift Me Up<br />8 Viva Las Vegas<br />9 County Fair<br />10 Code of Silence<br />11 Dead Man Walkin'<br />12 Countin' on a Miracle<br /><br />By the way, the same three discs are also included in the \\"Limited Edition\\" of \\"[[ASIN:B0000E1ALR The Essential Bruce Springsteen]],\\" which costs a bit less than this particular edition. Either way, this is a great collection!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|I first saw these videos when I worked in Youth Corrections to help educate the youth.  I thought it would be something that my father would enjoy,so I bought him the collection for his birthday.  He enjoyed it so much that we ordered two more sets for friends as gifts.  It's so insightful and very educational.  It isn't boring at all.  There were parts that brought me to tears because of the beauty and insight.  I would tell anyone it is worth buying.  It's educational and intriguing.  It is the type of video that makes you think ( in a good way.) I used to highly dislike the \\"nature\\" shows growing up, but this changed my mind.  It is filmed in a way that makes you want to know/learn more.
B0001I55SS|2.0|1979 ... let's see, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE, METEOR, MOONRAKER, BUTCH & SUNDANCE THE EARLY YEARS, THE FRISCO KID.  Ok, not exactly timeless classics.  It also brought this very, very strange and dark entry from Disney.  Incredible work by Peter Ellenshaw on this intended space version of Verne's classic.  Two stupidly \\"cute\\" robots -- the voices of Roddy McDowell and Slim Pickens.  My sharpest memory of this movie upon seeing it at a theatre at the time was, \\"Jeez, I can't believe it was only 90 minutes!  It seemed like forever!\\"  The ending, I guess, is some strange play on 2001.  Good cast but stilted dialogue undoes everything.  I'm not saying this movie is the worst thing ever done.  Hardly.  But Disney touted this as their modern 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA and Schell's character as a modern Nemo.  It just doesn't make it.  It does have a terrific cast: Schell, Ernest Borgnine, Yvette Mimmiuex, Robert Forester, Anthony Perkins, Joseph Bottoms.  A pity.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|I am a big fan of Pink Floyd, so Lead guitar guy David Gilmour decides to do a solo album.<br />I bought this when it first came out. Amazingly strong debut, I'm not an audiophile, I just know what sounds good, David G. is a master of the guitar and this my friend, is \\"a must have\\". If you've never heard \\"RAISE MY RENT\\", try it with some good headphones!!! It really strikes a chord, (insert pun here). David's work here is rich, deep, clean, and smooth. Refreshing as your favorite beverage, \\"Cry from the street\\" and \\"Short and sweet\\" are two more, \\"So far away\\" is like an Anthem I'm marching to. I love the entire album, you will too.<br /> *************COLLECT IT******************
0307383415|4.0|This is an interesting portrayal of a president who truly does not fit into the typical political mold.  His early years were exotic to the point of possibly being a detractor for later life.  Yet, told in honesty, Mr. Obama's pedigree is highly intriguing.  The middle of the book begins to drag.  Much time is spent on his activity in Chicago which becomes tiresome.  It seems that his early political efforts were overemphasized to counter some claims that he did not have the degree of experience needed to be a president.  Written today, I predict the book would look quite differently.  I would recommend this book so that the American people can understand how Mr. Obama's ethics and ideals were shaped at an early age and how history bears upon his leadership style today.
B000H7J9RQ|2.0|I remember seeing this concert when it originally aired on HBO back in 1986.  When I saw that it was available now on DVD from Amazon, I ordered it immediately.  In light of my hectic travel schedule, I didn't open the DVD to watch this great show until 2 months later, only to discover that the copy I received would not play in my DVD player.  When I placed the DVD in my laptop's DVD drive to confirm wheter or not it was my home DVD player or the DVD itself, I discovered that this DVD was not licensed for the U.S. region. My computer at least gave me the option of switching to the European regional classification, which I did. Most laptop's will only allow you to change regions for viewing up to 4 times, unless you have specific software that allows ongoing viewing for all international regional media classifications.  My DVD player does not allow you to change regions, which means I can only watch this concert on my computer. Which sucks.    Thank you Amazon.
1416594787|5.0|This is (surprisingly/embarrassingly) the first Dawkins book I have read, and I was very impressed, both with content as well as the author's broad knowledge and skill as a writer. Dawkins does a wonderful job of presenting the current body of evolutionary knowledge, showing that it truly is, \\"The greatest show on earth, the only game in town.\\" If every member of society understood the concepts in this book, our world would be a very different place, indeed. One, I would argue, much more rational and peaceful. Thanks, Prof. Dawkins, for devoting so much of your life to what I view as the most important cause in society today.
B00168OIOE|5.0|This is the 4-disc set which comes with Blu-ray, DVD, and a digital copy- what more could you ask for. This is a wonderful movie- one of Pixar's best- and it looks fantastic on Blu-ray. With an extra copy on DVD for the kids to watch in the car, and a digital copy for your mobile device, what more could you ask for?
B0000AK7AB|2.0|The pre-roll ad is unskippable.   And long.   And obnoxious.  I paid for the DVD,  I shouldn't have to wait through a 2 minute commercial to watch it.
0307454541|4.0|The story takes place in Sweden.  It has love, mystery, murder, scandal, jealousy, family history, financial ruin, corruption, deceit, and two main female characters....one with a tattoo and one that has disappeared.  :)<br /><br />The story begins with a trial of a journalist, Mikael Blomkvist, and his indictment and moves to a girl with a tattoo, Lisbeth Salander, who does investigation for a security firm and the girl, Harriet Vanger, who had disappeared 30+ years ago.<br /><br />Mikael was hired by the Vanger family to do an investigation into the disappearance of Harriet and why the body was never found.  The investigation is being done under the premise that Mikael is doing a piece on the history of the Vanger Family.  Lisbeth and Mikael do get to meet, and it gets even more interesting...lots of things become discovered through Lisbeth's skills as a researcher.<br /><br />It was a little slow at first, but once the book got into the lives of people and became more personal, you can't put it down....excellent writing.  You will love the book as the story unfolds...just give it a few pages.
B000001EUR|2.0|The album is just alright and a disapointment when compared with Blackout, Lovedrive, or Animal Magnetism. Virgin killer and In Trance are also better.  \\"I'm leaving you\\" is awful just a backwards copy of \\"Beat it\\" no less.  If you want to listen to a band that copies Michael Jackson, This is for you.  If you want some really great rock, listen to anything else by the Scorpions.  It really is crap compared to everything they did before.  I bought this the day it came out in '84, because of what a big fan I was. What a let down.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Like Brown's other best-selling novels, The Lost Symbol promises an intense labyrinth of mystery and revelation mixed with historical macabre; on this point it delivers, but where the novel is lacking is in the even distribution of the suspension of disbelief. The last quarter of the novel is devoted to Brown making the storyline more believable while attempting to clarify any suspicions the reader may have about what they just read.  There are glimpses of excitement throughout the beginning and middle of the novel that suggest we are all potential Indigo Children, but those hopes are dashed when Brown never puts those devices into play, which suggests that he is trying to avoid conflict with opposing religious groups; I don't blame him; he received a lot of flak for his last two best-sellers.  The novel possesses an excellent beginning in true Dan Brown fashion while the ending makes you want to reread The Da Vinci Code to satisfy your lust for a quality mystery thriller.
B002ZG997M|3.0|One does not usually begin a movie review by talking about the ending, but in the case of \\"The Book of Eli,\\" there's really no other way to go about it. Something, and I'm trying to be careful here, is revealed, something that's implausible but also undeniably clever. After the revelation, we discover what has been driving the main character to do what he does, and that's when it all come crashing down - this movie goes a long way for very little. How could the Hughes Brothers have let their film be so grossly undermined, especially after giving the audience a thoroughly absorbing buildup? I'm so disappointed. This movie could have been something. Up until the end, it really was something.     The story takes place in a post apocalyptic world of barren landscapes, effectively made to look harsh through a combination of overly bright lighting and muted color schemes. Broken highways trail across vast deserts. Cities lie in ruin. Ancient-looking cars litter the scenery, and some still contain the remains of their drivers. Drought reigns supreme. Everything is scarce, including food. The remaining population consists almost entirely of thieves, and some have even resorted to cannibalism. The reason for all this is left a little obscure; the characters keep referring to a cataclysmic event known as The Flash, which I interpret as being either a meteor or a solar flare. It also could have been manmade - a nuclear bomb, or something.     Wandering across this wasteland is Eli (Denzel Washington), a loner on a mission. He has the fighting skills of an assassin, able to take on groups of people singlehandedly and emerge victorious, even when chainsaws and machineguns are involved. He seems astutely aware of his surroundings, and his sense of hearing is unbelievably strong. He has lightning-quick reflexes, as if somehow seeing everything before it actually happens. But he never makes it his business to fight; he's just trying to head west. He has been for the last thirty years, ever since The Flash took place. What exactly is waiting for him there? He's remains mum on the subject. I can't help but love it when the Mysterious Stranger lives up to his name.    He makes a pit stop in a ramshackle town run by Carnegie (Gary Oldman), a wholly deplorable man who sends his flunkies out in search of a very specific book. No power on earth will make me reveal exactly what book it is. I will say that Eli just happens to be in possession of such a book and that, because of a social uprising soon after The Flash, it's the last of its kind. As a result, a select few know of its existence. Eli wants the book because he believes it will be the key to humanity's redemption. Carnegie wants the book because he can use it as a weapon. When all is explained at the end, we realize with great disillusionment that Carnegie's motives make a reasonable argument for why this book should have remained forgotten.    But I'm getting ahead of myself. Eli bonds with Solara (Mila Kunis), daughter of Claudia (Jennifer Beals), Carnegie's blind concubine. Not much is known about Solara; the most we get is that, like many who were born after The Flash, she never learned how to read. But it's not really about getting to know her, anyway; it's about her relationship with Eli, the way she questions him about life before The Flash, why he's so intent on heading west, and whether or not he can teach her how to read. Eli is alarmingly unresponsive on the subject of reading, and we don't understand why until the end.    And that brings me back to where I started. A mystery is only as good as its solution; if what leads up to the ending is better than the actual ending, you've failed at telling a successful story. The big revelation at the end of \\"The Book of Eli\\" is immensely unsatisfying, not only because it sends a message that contradicts certain events of the story, but also because it lacks the inventiveness and scope of the film's opening and middle sections. It was a bait and switch. I felt cheated.    All the same, there are many recommendable things about this movie. The buildup is carefully structured and wonderfully paced. The visuals are stunning. The dialogue is decent. The performances are good, especially Oldman's. It's just the ending that's bad. This is a strange situation. I'm urging you to avoid \\"The Book of Eli,\\" but because my review has been so vague, seeing it may be the only way for you to understand where I'm coming from. I really wanted to like this film. Up until the final five minutes, I did like it very much. So maybe it would be worth your while to go and then leave before everything is revealed. In this case, that would not be a waste of money. Trust me on this one.

B001OQCV60|5.0|In 8th grade, my English teacher was so obsessed with Sherlock Holmes that I have not wanted to read or watch anything even mentioning Holmes.  But, almost 7 years later, I decided to give it a try (since I love Downey and Law).  I fell in love with this movie.<br /><br />I read in a article with Guy Ritchie, before the movie came out, that he was nervous about people take on the martial arts Holmes.  But, then he pointed out that in the Sherlock Holmes stories, even Doyle mentions that Holmes has some martial arts training and skills...they just aren't shown in the stories (and what stories in that time period DID?).  And, come on, this is 2010.  Filmmakers know that if they want a movie to sell, they have to add action and violence in it (I mean, just look how well the Saw francise is doing).  I realize that there are die-hard Holmes fanatics out there that aren't happy with this, but really the only people that would go see a Holmes movie done like the originals are the older generation.<br /><br />The movie itself, though, as I mentioned was amazing, in my opinion.  It had a story line that made me begin to think that it would end up like the newest Indiana Jones movie, but it was really summed up in a logical way at the end.  The music went so well with this movie that I ran out and bought the CD as soon as I could.  There was enough humor mixed in with the action to keep you laughing through the film...things like Holmes's experiments on the dog and the flashbacks that explain how he came to learn certain information.<br /><br />All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and can't wait for it to be released on DVD.
0441013597|5.0|I wish I could distinctly remember the first time I read this book.  I wish, in fact, I could go back and read it again for the first time all over again - it's just that wonderful.  I associate it with The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) and The Foundation Trilogy, although I read those two at different times - the association is more to do with their being science fiction books that are overtly concerned with the political, sociocultural, and ecological parts of world building and that is also how I think of Dune.  Later I read The Snow Queen by Joan D. Vinge and was struck by how Dunelike it was in its own way.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of the space opera kind of science fiction in novels.  Love it in movies, but in novels people rushing about in spaceships just doesn't do it for me.  Dune is not that kind of science fiction.  It is sharp, fresh, and fascinating even all these years (45 of them) later.  In it Herbert built an amazing and intricate world and culture that he populated with wonderful characters - that he then wrote a really great story is what makes this book a classic.  I re-read it periodically and find something new to like each time.<br /><br />As always, I like best the early parts of the novel - the preparation for taking over Arrakis, the gom jabbar, the intricate political maneuvering towards the inevitable betrayal.  I like the rest of the book, but the first third is what truly pleases me.  It's so Shakespearean in its plot and scope and Shakespeare always was a crowd-pleaser.<br /><br />It was good to revisit Arrakis and it is still bitterly disappointing to know that the books that followed this one in the Dune Chronicles are fat, pretentious, and boring (sort of like Baron Harkonnen).
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Found a copy of this movie in Iraq while deployed there with the Army.  I used to be a Czech linguist; I have travelled to Ireland; and I play the guitar and sing (though not as well as Glen Hansard)...so the cover description caught my interest.  I had no idea what a charming story I was in for.    Previous reviews have already given away too much of the story, all I can do is recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates independent films, quirky singer/songwriter tunes, sympathetic characters, cute girls, and realistic romance stories.  Watch this movie, and then watch it again.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|(500) Days of Summer is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. When my friend asked me to go see it withe her, I didn't know what it was supposed to be about. I thought it would be yet another cheesy romantic comedy, but then I watched it. The plot was thoroughly original and the jokes were ACTUALLY FUNNY! Plus, you actually feel for the characters, who seem actually human unlike in some movies out there. Besides, why wouldn't you want to watch a movie with a random musical number?
B002ZG997C|5.0|\\"The Book Of Eli\\" is great! This is how the story goes: In the not-too-distant future, some 30 years after the final war, a solitary man walks across the wasteland that was once America. Empty cities, broken highways, seared earth--all around him, the marks of catastrophic destruction. There is no civilization here, no law. The roads belong to gangs that would murder a man for his shoes, an ounce of water... or for nothing at all.    But they're no match for this traveler.    A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize. Driven by this commitment and guided by his belief in something greater than himself, Eli does what he must to survive--and continue.    Only one other man in this ruined world understands the power Eli holds, and is determined to make it his own: Carnegie, the self-appointed despot of a makeshift town of thieves and gunmen. Meanwhile, Carnegie's adopted daughter Solara is fascinated by Eli for another reason: the glimpse he offers of what may exist beyond her stepfather's domain.    But neither will find it easy to deter him. Nothing--and no one--can stand in his way. Eli must keep moving to fulfill his destiny and bring help to a ravaged humanity.    The cast led by Denzel Washington (who also produced) (as Eli) & Gary Oldman (as Carnegie) is great! The directing by The Hughes Brothers (Albert & Allen) (both of them also directed \\"Menace II Society\\" (1993, both also co-produced and wrote the story), \\"Dead Presidents\\" (1995, both also produced and wrote the story) & \\"From Hell\\" (2001, both also executive produced) is great! The story & screenplay by Gary Whitta is great!    The music by Atticus Ross is great! The cinematography by Don Burgess (who also did the cinematography to \\"Forrest Gump\\" (1994), \\"Contact\\" (1997), \\"What Lies Beneath\\" (2000), \\"Cast Away\\" (2000), & \\"The Polar Express\\" (2004), all which were directed by Robert Zemeckis), \\"Spider-Man\\" (2002), \\"Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines\\" (2003), & the upcoming \\"Priest\\" (2010) is great! The film editing by Cindy Mollo is great! The casting by Mindy Marin (who also did the casting to \\"Up In The Air\\" (2009), the upcoming \\"Tooth Fairy\\" (2010) & \\"Repo Men\\" (2010) is great! The production design by Gae S. Buckley (who also did the production design to \\"Open Range\\" (2003) is great! The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr (who also did the art direction to \\"The Last Samurai\\" (2003) is great! The costume design by Sharen Davis (who also did the costume design to \\"Devil In A Blue Dress\\" (1995, which also starred Washington and Jennifer Beals), \\"Antwone Fisher\\" (2002), \\"The Great Debaters\\" (2007), \\"Out Of Time\\" (2003), all which also starred Washington), \\"Ray\\" (2004), \\"The Pursuit Of Happyness\\" (2006), \\"Dreamgirls\\" (2006) & \\"Seven Pounds\\" (2008) is great!    This is a great action film that is a little different than other action films. This is a different looking film that people aren't probably used to. Denzel Washington & Gary Oldman are excellent as usual.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|Lost Season 5 is a great continuation of what is happening (both on and off the island). This season was MUCH more enjoyable than say Season 3 or 4. The end of season 5 only helps to prepare fans for the final season...
B002K0WBXW|3.0|Synopsis:  Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is a domineering executive whom no one likes because of her cold and often cruel personality.  Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds)is her entirely-dominated assistant, who has the task of doing whatever she wants when she wants it.  When Margaret is threatened to be deported back to her native Canada due her visa status, she proposes that Andrew that they have a sham-marriage so she can stick around.  Andrew is reluctant at first, but sees what he can get out of the deal from her (namely, getting his work published).  They fly from New York to Andrew's native Alaska to see his grandmother (Betty White) for her 90th birthday and to inform his family about their plans to get married.  Although Andrew's father Joe (Craig T. Nelson) is skeptical, his mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) is ecstatic and surprises the couple by making their marriage plans for them in Alaska.  Though initially cold to everything going on around her, Margaret begins to see how well she's accepted by Andrew's family and it starts to open the floodgates for her as to why she's so emotionally distant, which allows her to admit to herself that she genuinely loves Andrew.  Will she go on with the marriage, or will the guilt drive her to admit that she's trying to pull of a scam?    There were a lot of fun moments in the film and up to the ending I was excited to see what would happen.  But then the ending took a somewhat un-climactic turn into predictability.  I don't want to discuss it because I don't want to give it away, but had the ending been done differently from the wedding scene to the finish, I may have gotten more enjoyment out of it than what I did.  It was like the movie forsake the budding chemistry between the two leads to throw out an ending that would be easier to spell out for the audience.     Be that as it may, Bullock and Reynolds were just awesome together, the cinematography itself was great, and the overall comedy was definitely there.  Peoplewho would be less-particular than I am about the film's ending probably loved it because aside from that, it was a good time.  I say it's definitely a solid rental and worth purchasing if you really enjoy it.
B002VECMB8|5.0|It seems a bit strange, even sacrilegious to say that a film about people losing their jobs is a great film, funny and moving. But \\"Up In The Air\\", the new film from writer - director Jason Reitman (\\"Juno\\", \\"Thank You For Smoking\\") is a very good (great?) film deftly mixing comedy, funny and dark, with real human emotions and familiar situations. Starring George Clooney,\\" Air\\" is a film to watch when the Awards season begins.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) plays a man who lives on airplanes; Ryan works for a company who hires him out to travel around the country and fire people who are being laid off. Basically, he does the dirty work for people who are too afraid to do it themselves. He spends so much time in airports, on airplanes, and in chain hotels, these have become his new home. He prefers these places to his actual apartment in Omaha and dreads returning there. He also has a goal. He wants to earn a coveted award from his airline of choice for flying more than a million miles. Then, his boss (Jason Bateman) tells him they have just hired a new college graduate, Natalie (Anna Kendrick, \\"Twilight\\") who has come up with a revolutionary way for them to do their job, through teleconferencing. But before they implement this plan, he wants Natalie to travel with Ryan, to learn the ropes. Ryan meets another fellow traveler, Alex (Vera Farmiga) who seems equally at home in airports and hotels. They hook up and realize they want to meet as often as possible. Both of these women begin to change the way Ryan thinks. But is it too late for him to change his life?<br /><br />It is almost amazing how accomplished and interesting the short career of director Jason Reitman has been. Sure, he is the son of mega-director Ivan (of \\"Ghostbusters\\" fame), but Jason's films have shown a remarkable amount of talent, skill and thought. His first film, \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is a scathing, very funny satire about lobbyists. His second, \\"Juno\\", propelled Ellen Page to stardom and earned some Awards buzz. Now, with \\"Up In The Air\\", the director has created his most accomplished, introspective, meaningful and interesting film yet. \\"Air\\" is sure to be a contender for many awards in the next few months.<br /><br />Reitman's \\"Air\\" is the story of a man who travels across country and fires people for a living. And because of this, Ryan Bingham is basically an unlikable guy, which isn't a bad thing at all, but it is a strange thing to find in a major studio release. And a lot of credit for our interest in watching Ryan's journey has to go to Clooney. We get a feeling for Bingham, who he is, what he is, why he is, all of which is illustrated very succinctly in a voice over from Ryan. Ryan seems to revel in the world he has created for himself. Always on the move, always in another airplane, another hotel room. At one point, Ryan swipes a frequent customer card and announces to us the employee is programmed to great him in a specific way. The way Ryan (and Clooney) tells us about this barely hides the frequent flyer's pleasure at having reached such a lofty level of business with this other corporation. While this reveals a lot about Ryan's business dealings to us, it also shows a lot about his character. He seems to revel in the fact that some anonymous woman, who could care less about him (and vice versa) has to greet him in a specific way. This is what constitutes a relationship in his world and he is all the happier for it. And of course, we can see how shallow and empty his world is, so we feel more than a little empathy for him. All of these feelings come flooding through us even as we begin to have opposite feelings towards him, because we can't forget he goes around firing people, taking their livelihood from them.<br /><br />But as soon as these conflicts start to stir within us, they quickly disappear. We start to like Ryan and care for him. If he didn't do this job, someone else would. And he doesn't seem to revel in the actual details of the job; he seems to try to be as empathetic to the people around him as possible. Someone else would probably be less kind to the unfortunate souls.<br /><br />Clooney's performance seems effortless and this makes Ryan seem all the more viable a person. And because of this, I have no doubt he will be nominated for a slew of awards in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Wisely, Reitman does a very interesting thing to help make Ryan all the more human. Ryan's boss (Jason Bateman) introduces Natalie (Anna Kendrick \\"New Moon\\", \\"Twilight\\") as a new hotshot college graduate with some great ideas. And soon, the idea is revealed. If they start to do their job through teleconferencing, the company will save a lot of money on airfare, hotels, etc. This will effectively ground Ryan, causing him to panic slightly. But he also realizes physically sitting in front of someone they are firing helps the situation. Sure, it is a crappy situation to begin with, but firing people long distance isn't going to help an already bad situation get any better. This is illustrated when they give the new system a trial run.<br /><br />In a way, they make Natalie even worse than Ryan and this helps to make Ryan more likable.<br /><br />Natalie and Ryan take a road trip together, to give Natalie some real world experience before the company fully adopts her plan. This trip becomes a growing experience for the recent college grad as Ryan tries to impart everything he has learned to her.<br /><br />One night, Ryan meets Alex (Vera Farmiga) at the hotel he is staying at. They have dinner, drinks and start to flirt over who has better Executive Rewards Cards. Ryan recognizes a kindred spirit and they really get along well, so they start to try to plan their schedules around when they can hook up together. The more they see each other, the more attracted they become and Ryan begins to question his existence, everything he has set-up for his life.<br /><br />The more we see and live with Ryan, the more we grow to like him, the more we grow to accept him.<br /><br />Reitman also uses a bunch of actual people who were recently fired as the victims of Ryan and Natalie's work. This gives the entire film a greater resonance and makes it seem more personal. Each of the real people reportedly gives the same response they gave when they were actually fired. These people are presented in a couple of quick montages giving us an overview of what Ryan does everyday, how many people he has to deal with, how many negative reactions and what has led him to become slightly numb but also horrified at Natalie's new plans.<br /><br />This sums up what makes \\"Up In The Air\\" so successful. Most of the things in the film, the characters, the story, their actions, the places they go, have at least two sides. Reitman and his cast and crew show us both, and this helps make everything more interesting and real.<br /><br />If you haven't already seen it, go!o be as empathetic to the people around him as possible.

034544678X|5.0|I picked up Patricia B. McConnell Ph.D's book The Other End of the Leash: Why We Do What We Do Around Dogs after my dog training mentor recommended it to me with the review of \\"you'll look at dogs completely different after reading this.\\" She was right. This book is phenomenal.<br /><br />Whereas a lot of dog books talk about how to train our canine companions and give training advice, 'The Other End of the Leash' compares and contrasts how humans and dogs interact with their own species and with each other. As McConnell points out, as humans part of the primate family, we're so ingrained with certain behaviors that we easily forget that what we find to be socially acceptable isn't the same in the dog world. McConnell clearly illustrates all the similarities and differences and where we,, as humans go wrong when interacting with our dogs. And she does all this in a reader-friendly way, mixing in anecdotes with scientific research. It's a fast read and an informative read.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"how to train your dog\\" book but a \\"how to understand your dog better\\" book. She explains how dogs are expert body language readers, why rough primate play can cause trouble when we do it with dogs, how to get your dog to come to you when called, translating \\"primate speak\\" to \\"dog speak\\" and much more. How many times have we bent down and said \\"Come Fluffy. Come Fluffy. Come Fluffy.\\" only to have Fluffy stare at you awkwardly, or repeat \\"sit\\" a hundred times, each verbal command getting louder than the last with no results? McConnell explains why and how we can communicate better with our pups.<br /><br />My favorite section of the book is her chapter on dominance and how social status relates to the behavior of both humans and dogs.  This topic of dominance and being \\"alpha\\" definitely wins the Inigo Montoya's \\"You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means\\" Award, and trainers and owners a like will benefit from reading the chapter. McConnell explains why dogs prefer a benevolent leader over a status seeking \\"alpha-wananbe\\" and why \\"getting dominant\\" over your pup can make things worse.<br /><br />If you really want to understand your dog better -- and when we expect our pups to understand English, we should take the time to understand them -- pick up 'The Other End of the Leash.' You, and your dog, will be glad you did.benevolent leader over a status seeking \\"alpha-wananbe\\" and why \\"getting dominant\\" over your pup can make things worse.

B002T9H2ME|4.0|The film was viewed on a 50\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD35 Player. The AQ and PQ are both crisp and clean. Unfortunately I missed the film on the festival circuit, but am glad I finally had a chance to see it. Sam Rockwell does an absolutely fantastic job playing dual \\"roles\\", and the special features which discuss the technical aspects of achieving such shots, as well as the entire look of the film, with a relatively small budget, are very interesting. If you're interested in film at all, from its technical aspects, you may like to investigate the featurettes, especially on the visual elements. Another striking element of the film is its score. Though simple and repeating, for me, it matches the isolation, repetitiveness and loneliness of Sam's character, as well as his predicament, very well. The twist in the film is not necessarily shocking but blends into the story seamlessly and further elevates the film as a modern sci-fi film with a quiet, yet powerful temperament. It's not your typical \\"trapped in space, with a creature\\" type film, and without giving anything away, it is an interesting character study, psychologically, as well as visually. The film was shot for 5 million, and for its objective of shooting a sci-fi film with interesting visual elements, I found it to be very visually appealing. Definitely check this one out, it may surprise you.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I just returned home from watching James Cameron's latest epic - and I do mean EPIC!! - release.  With his \\"Titanic\\" sleeping comfortably at the bottom of the cold ocean, rest assured that his \\"Avatar\\" is soaring high and mighty above us all.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED this movie!!<br /><br />There is one thing though that I couldn't help but notice during my experience with this visual and stunning masterpiece - Cameron has indeed been viewing (and become greatly influenced by) the artwork of Roger Dean (famous for his surrealistic / fantasy album covers by Yes and other prominent artists).  The colorful flying dragons, the floating mountains, the majestic and mystical arches ... they're all there!!  And being a bigtime Yes fan myself, I was simply enthralled by the whole thing.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the DVD release of this one, folks!<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor then and GO SEE THIS MOVIE ON THE BIG SCREEN!  You will NOT be disappointed ... I can safely promise you this.<br /><br />Good job, James!  (as usual)
B000009RC2|5.0|A few months back, I stopped by the music store near my house because I felt my CD collection was lacking something, but what?  Well, the store I went to doesn't have an extensive selection of music but does have an extensive selection of jazz.  I've been meaning to check out some Billy Cobham and kept hearing from friends and periodicals about his work with Mahavishnu Orchestra.  Completely ignorant to what the album sounded like (which is ironically much like every album I purchase and subsequently cherish), I took a bet and bought the CD.    Wow.  Did it blow my mind.    I've been a fan of rock/metal music since I was younger and started getting into real jazz around the time I was in my late teens/early 20s.  To see these guys have a wonderful fusion of instruments (I guess the pun has to be intended, eh?) open up a musical landscape is something that's hard to define in words.  It doesn't always have the pedal to the floor and there are a lot of nice, chill moments as well.  But when they throw it into overdrive, strap on a seat belt and get ready for the ride.  The listening experience is wonderful and keeps you captivated from start to finish.      I have to say that this album goes beyond being a good album and is a work of art that is culturally significant to us all.  I recommend it to everyone.
1423119509|4.0|I adore this series and was excited to get this collector's set.  Unfortunately, it was poorly packaged and the box came damaged.  I sent it back and Amazon sent a new set to me, but that box was also damaged.  They don't want to try a third time, so they're giving me 20% off the price, which is fair, but I think they should be able to package it properly.  The books are in perfect condition, but the collectors box gets damaged in shipping.  A disappointment.  But, the series is quite enthralling and I adore the books themselves!!!!
B002SJIO4A|1.0|This is a truly awful movie to watch. Although the premise behind it sounds interesting, once you start watching it, you really wish the humans and aliens would just kill each other off and be done with it so the movie would be over.<br /><br />First, it's like watching a documentary. Next, the aliens act so stupid you have to wonder how they could possibly be intelligent enough to create such advanced technology. The aliens are pretty gross looking in my opinion, and as far as being sympathetic to them, it's rather hard because again, they come off as being stupid for allowing themselves to be treated as they are.<br /><br />Ultimately this movie suffers from the \\"B\\" word: BORING. If you're having trouble sleeping though, I highly recommend it. It will definitely make you want to go to sleep just to avoid watching it.<br /><br />********************************<br />Additional information:<br /><br />When I wrote this review, I couldn't think of the right word to describe this so I used documentary. However, it's more like a reality show, or something you would see in real time.<br /><br />Are reality shows edited? I really don't know because I don't watch them. I don't consider them to be interesting either.<br /><br />If you like reality shows or shows shot in real time, you may very well like this movie. I don't know. What I do know for sure is that I didn't like it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />As my mother always said, \\"Different strokes for different folks.\\" Since all of the criticism about my review has come from supposedly adult, but immature males who still play with toys, I can only conclude that this movie was made for that class.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|I am not a John Mayer fan.  I recently saw him live on Fuse and thought I would give him another chance.  I enjoyed hearing many of the songs on this album live but was disappointed when I heard the studio version.  I almost shut the CD off and threw it away midway through song two, \\"All we ever do is say goodbye.\\"  It is garbage.  Mr. Mayer must have thought he had one good line and was never able to form any other lyrics to build the song into something worthwhile.  There are some decent songs at the end of the CD such as assassin, war of my life, and edge of desire but they are definitely not songs that will make me want to listen to the cd again.  I probably will not jump in line to get his next cd but I'll keep my mind open.
1579125549|4.0|I am relatively new to tournament chess (rating about 1300), and I have been working with many different puzzle books trying to improve my tactics. I picked up Polgar's book on chess because it includes simply so much material.        This book is good quality -- that is to say, the puzzles clearly have one solution, there seems to be no dispute. You get what you pay for: a LOT of problems. It also includes miniature games of 25 moves or less which, for me, were fantastic to see some exceptional tactics. On a mere practical stand-point, the book is BIG. That means, for one thing, you have thousands of problems and exercises. On the other hand, it means the book is BIG. It's hefty. It takes up a lot of space in a bag, so you can't always carry it with you.       As far as the book being organized, the first 306 problems are white to play, mate in 1, the next few thousand problems (literally) are mate in 2 -- both black and white to play in their respective sections, and then about three hundred problems of white to move, mate in three. There is also a section of miniature games (less than 25 moves), where you see a real game that was played and see if you can find the appropriate continuation (this description is very brief; technically you play out the game up to a certain move. You're given the hint only as to the key square, and there is a combination based on that square that mates. It's an excellent tactical exercise), along with a few basic end-game sections.       I have found this book to be much better for me at helping my end-game than at my tactics. Tactics are extremely useful, but most of the diagrams in the book end in mate so you are really looking to see how to kill the king again and again. The drills by rote are excellent practice, however, in that you can see some fundamental piece interaction and fundamental check mates (for example, how rooks + bishop can hem in a king, what kind of pattern to look for when you want to mate with a queen, etc).         In terms of difficulty the first 306 problems are very VERY easy. First, it's because it's mate in 1. Second, because you KNOW it's mate in one. This kind of mental prompting is not something you'd see in a real game. Third, some of the diagrams are simple enough that there's only one piece that can put the king in check, ergo the solution is pretty apparent. That said, they are useful for drilling the basics.       One you move past it, the diagrams become more difficult, but they still have this sort of artificial air about them. This kind of artificial-ness comes about because you know what's side it is to play, and you know in exactly how many moves there is mate. This prompting is again, not something you would receive in a real game, but even so Polgar's book is excellent practice none-the-less. If you're new in particular, this kind of prompting can help you build yourself up for the more advanced tactics books (like Winning Chess Tactics for Juniors, another book I've used and reviewed).            I recommend Polgar, but understand what you are getting. You are getting a big fat book that drills you repeatedly on the basics. That's NOT a bad thing. You are not going to get mind-numbingly difficult tactical problems, nor are you getting a realistic game simulation. You are going to get rote practice on fundamental combination, piece interactions, and basic end-games. You DO get realistic game simulation later in the book during the \\"miniature games\\" section, though that is not your standard problems where you can simply breeze through them, you really need a board to play through the game to see how it comes about. This is a very useful section for me, and a section most other reviewers have neglected to mention.          It's rote. It's basic. But everyone needs their fundamentals at one point or another. It also makes a very good test of your competence -- these problems ARE fairly easy, given all the prompting, so if you're having difficulty with the \\"mate in 2 problems\\" then it's a good sign to see you need to keep practicing. So again, it's not necessarily the best book on tactics out there, but this is a solid drill book that helps you improve your game.

B002N5N4HG|5.0|As an avid fan of the original NCIS series, I was happy to hear that a spinoff would be introduced!  I've only every seen Chris O'Donnell in Greys Anatomy, and only heard of LL Cool J, Danielle Ruah, etc. as part of the series. But they top off an amazing series that I surprisingly prefer to the original!    Although I love the witty banter of the Gibbs team, the upbeat comedy they integrate into the LA series (particular Sam and G!) cracks me upp time after time. Nate brings a whole new characteristic to NCIS, where profiling suspects is lacked in the original seriesm whilst Hetty provides a mothering comic relief to the series. Dom, Kensi and Eric also appear frequently, and add a new dimension the original series does not. You may grow tired of just the Gibbs team, but the other agents provide a refreshing new outlook. It also manages to integrate well with the original, frequently including Abby and Vance.    Overall, aside from being a crime procedural, it brightens the atmosphere more so than its original. The cases (especially 1x07) do not disappoint, and needless to say, I've watched my digital episodes over and over. It's my most watched program (almost everyday!), and surprises me with excellent quality. The DVD should be no disappointment!

He ran on and on, but I stayed with it thinking something was going to happen but it never did. It is as if he was trying to fill pages. Truly not worth the time.

0756655307|2.0|Those who gave this book high marks either don't know comics or the purpose of an encyclopedia, or is related the author. I'd never use an \\"encyclopedia\\" which was full of errors and lacking in info, even at age 8. That's exactly what the 2009 updated Marvel Encyclopedia is. For example,Wolverine and Daredevil are among the most skilled martial artists. So why do their entries make NO mention of their fighting skills? Hercules is among the strongest heroes. So why does his entry NOT AT ALL mention his strength? Northstar has super speed and reflexes. His entry makes NO mention of this. Pg. 358 erroneously shows a picture of Balder instead of Hogun as a member of the Warriors Three. I could go on and on, but it'd take up space needed for my other criticisms. Several characters are shown with costumes 10-30 years outdated! And some of the info regarding the powers of many characters are equally outdated. TME also wastes far too much space on many insignificant 4th rate characters who've not appeared in decades, while more deserving characters are omitted. I think TME may make a nice gift for a 8-12 yr old because of some nice artwork inside and kids care more for style than substance. Anyone looking for substance stick to the Official Handbooks of the Marvel Universe. Even outdated they're superior.
B00275EGWY|5.0|Unlike many of the earlier films on the same subject, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" starts off by accepting the Iraq war as a given.  That is to say it doesn't try to place the issue in any kind of larger sociopolitical context or to explain why the Americans felt compelled to wage the conflict in the first place.  Instead, it focuses on the everyday activities of a three-man Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit (EOD) whose job it is to dismantle, as safely as possible, the literally hundreds of still-to-be-detonated IEDs strewn across the streets of Baghdad.  The leader of the trio has just been killed in the line of duty and has now been replaced by a newcomer whose seeming recklessness and flagrant disregard for protocol doesn't sit well with the other members of the team, who feel that their own survival is being needlessly threatened by his carelessness - especially now that there is less than a month-and-a-half left to go before the team is to be taken out of rotation.<br /><br />Before getting to the more \\"literary\\" aspects of the film, let's just say right up front that, on a strictly \\"cinematic\\" level, \\"The Hurt Locker\\" is an astonishing accomplishment in every sense of the term.  Director Kathryn Bigelow employs hand-held cameras, razor-sharp editing and an abundance of point-of-view shots to create a film of palpable, nail-biting  immediacy that plunges the audience directly into the heart of the action.  Yet, she punctuates that with the nonstop sound of jet fighters roaring overhead just to remind us that, hard as it may be to imagine at times, there is an even larger war taking place somewhere beyond the reaches of the one we see here.  This story is clearly just one of many.<br /><br />On a thematic level, the movie explores the various ways these three men cope with the inconceivable stress of life on the battlefield.  Staff Sergeant William James finds an adrenaline-pumping thrill in living life on the edge, of always being just a hair-trigger away from possible death.  Specialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved.  And Sergeant T.J. Sanborn occupies a kind of pragmatic, middle ground between the two, willing to put his life on the line to get the job done but not to willy-nilly just tempt fate for the sake of doing so.  Yet, thanks to Marc Boal`s perceptive screenplay, each man emerges as a complex individual in his own right, never a \\"type.\\"  James, for instance, may be wild and reckless, but he also has a caring, compassionate side that he reveals in off-handed and unexpected moments of tenderness towards others and loyalty towards his men.  And there's a stunning coda that forces us, perhaps reluctantly, to see James in an entirely different light from how we've been viewing him up to that point.<br /><br />Relative unknowns Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty are heartbreakingly effective as James, Sanborn and Eldridge, respectively, managing to create fully realized, empathetic characters amidst all the pyrotechnic war-movie effects.  And even a few familiar faces - Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes and Evangeline Lilly from \\"Lost\\" - show up at various points in the film (in a way, this use of \\"stars\\" - though obviously done for purposes of procuring financing - could easily have compromised the integrity of the picture, but the unusual way Bigelow uses them helps to mitigate that effect).<br /><br />The real key to \\"The Hurt Locker\\"'s success is that it never sacrifices intimacy for the grander picture, never allows the war movie setting to supercede the characters and their stories.  It is first, last and always a movie about  ordinary people caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  It's also unforgettable.cialist Owen Eldridge, on the other hand, has become so obsessed with death that he fears he will freeze up right at the moment when he needs to be most clear-headed, steady-handed and steely-nerved.

0446567337|1.0|First off, I couldn't stand Savannah, she was portrayed as being this too perfect southern Belle. She turns out to be a vacuous, spoiled, selfish brat who leads John on. It progressed slowly, with characters that were just unlikeable. It was trite and quite frankly Johns self defeatist attitude was just as annoying as Savannah's falseness. Just a waste of time and money. Sparks books are usually good but this one has the tone of a novice.

0307269981|4.0|Lisbeth Salander is accused of killing three people. There is such strong evidence against her that she decides to go into hiding.<br /><br />The reader learns that the magazine \\"Millennium\\" was about to publish a story about the abuse of prostitutes. It was going to tell who was behind the abuses and name a number of influentual people would be implicated in the crime.<br /><br />In a strong, plot driven novel, the reader follows the bashing Lisbeth receives. We also see the investigation to the killings in three directions, the official investigation, Mikael Blomkvist's search for the answers, and that of the research agency where she used to work.<br /><br />Lisbeth continues to be one of the finest female characters in literature. The manner in which she is described shows her uniqueness, from having a photographic memory, to her taking boxing lessons and childhood history, She's just a gutsy, relentless and interesting character to follow.<br /><br />The plot was complex but if the reader takes their time, the story is packed with dynamite. One point that gave me some diffuculty was that the author had so many characters whose name began with the letter \\"B\\" that it was confusing. We read of Blomkvist, Bjurman, Bublinsky and Berger who is married to Beekman.  Other than that, this was an original plot with lots of action and provided an enjoyable read.
6302642248|5.0|Pinocchio is one hour and twenty-seven minutes long and was released in theaters on February 9, 1940. The story begins with Jiminy Cricket introducing the story of Pinocchio and who it all began. Jiminy Cricket hopped into a clock and toy shop where all the clocks and toys are made out of wood. After exploring the place he spots Pinocchio and soon Geppetto, along with his pet cat Figaro, walks into the room to put the finishing touches on the place. At the time Pinocchio had no name and it was Geppetto who gave Pinocchio his name. Figaro and Cleo, Geppetto's pet goldfish, do not like the name. Later on that night, Geppetto makes a wish on the Wishing Star and he wishes that Pinocchio was a real boy. After Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo are sound asleep; the Blue Fairy appears and turns Pinocchio into a living puppet. She tells Pinocchio if he wants to become a real boy then he must prove to be brave, truthful and unselfish. Pinocchio must also be able to tell right from wrong and to listen to his conscience. The Blue Fairy appoints Jiminy Cricket to be Pinocchio's and help him to teach right from wrong. While Jiminy Cricket and Pinocchio are singing Give A Little Whistle, Pinocchio falls onto some pots and wakes up Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo. Geppetto finds to his surprise that Pinocchio has come to life. Geppetto realizes that his wish has come true and is overcome with joy. The next day Geppetto sends Pinocchio to school. On his way to school Pinocchio runs into John Worthingthon \\"Honest John\\" Foulfellow and Gideon. Honest John tricks him into actor's life. Jiminy Cricket, who is running late, tries to talk Pinocchio out of it. Pinocchio instead goes with Honest John and Gideon. Honest John real intent is to sell Pinocchio to Stromboli who is a puppet master. Stromboli uses Pinocchio in his act and in his stage debut Pinocchio sings I've Got No Strings. Jiminy Cricket finally catches up to Pinocchio and sees Pinocchio enjoying himself. At first Jiminy was just going toleave Pinocchio, but instead decides to say good-bye to him and wish him luck. When he arrives he finds that Stromboli has locked Pinocchio in a bird cage. Jiminy tries to pick the lock but is unable to do so. The Blue Fairy arrives and asks Pinocchio what has happen. When Pinocchio starts to tells lies his nose begins to grow. The Blue Fairy explains \\"A lie keeps growing and growing until it's as clear as the nose on your face.\\" Pinocchio say he will go straight the Blue Fairy sets him free. On the way home Pinocchio runs into John Worthingthon \\"Honest John\\" Foulfellow and Gideon again. To Pinocchio credit he does try to talk his way out of Honest John offer to go to Pleasure Island saying he has to go home. Honest John once again tricks Pinocchio and as Jiminy Cricket says here we go again. Jiminy Cricket has a bad feeling about Pleasure Island and Pinocchio along with his new friend Lampwick go off and have a good time. Jiminy finally finds Pinocchio playing pool with Lampwick and Jiminy is furious. Pinocchio is having a good time does not want to leave and Jiminy leaves in a huff. Jiminy finds out the truth about Pleasure Island; the kids are being turned into donkeys to be sold to salt mines and circuses. Jiminy runs back to inform Pinocchio about what is going. In the meantime Pinocchio is watching Lampwick turn into a donkey and Pinocchio is also taking on donkey features. Pinocchio grows a donkey's tail and ears. Jiminy arrives and rescues Pinocchio. Once the two are back home they find the home baron and a message from the Blue Fairy saying Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo went looking for him but were swallowed by a whale named Monstro and resides there now. Pinocchio and Jiminy Cricket go in search of Monstro and find him. Pinocchio is swallowed by Monstro and is reunited with Geppetto, Figaro and Cleo. Pinocchio comes up with a plan to escape and Monstro sneeze the gang out of his stomach. This makes Monstro angry and tries to get them back in his stomach again.

0060557818|5.0|Highlight of this deftly-constructed fantasy is Gaiman's elegant but powerful prose style. Template of ordinary man thrust into increasingly bizarre parallel world was also powerfully done in Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide series and Spencer's Resume with Monsters, but Gaiman still has much to add. Some interesting trivia about the history of London, and London's ambience and atmosphere powerfully drawn.    There is a clever allusion to Neuromancer in novel's comparison of the blue of the sky to a \\"television tuned to a dead channel\\" (note that at the time Neuromancer was written, that signified a different color.)     Gaiman has strong logical underpinning, although there was no apparent reason that Croup & Vandemar did not consume de Carabas as they did to their previous victim. Only structural imperfection is that the ending feels tacked on and wanders on a bit long.    Nevertheless, well worth reading for its plot, characters and writing.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|I heard and read all the reviews and wanted to see what the big deal was about Paranormal Activity. When I finished watching this movie, I was to scared to move. Through out the movie you don't get to see the presence, but you do see what it does. It was litterally one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. I'm usually pretty good with horor/scary movies but I think I met my match. Dont believe the negative reviews. Anyone who thinks this movie was boring is just in denial. It will scare you.

B002XMGGK6|3.0|I saw this movie as Death Wish meets Seven. Gerard Butler's character becomes warped by the tragedy he suffers and the audience is made to feel sympathetic to him as he sets about making matters right in his mind. He is the maniac you hate to love. I found his journey suspenseful, shocking, terrifying and satisfying all at the same time. Foxx plays a self-centered jerk whose head is up his butt at home and professionally. He is the lawyer you love to hate. The supporting roles are well played by a variety of solid character actors.    The anti-hero does terrible things that ultimately do have to be stopped but there is still a part of me that thinks of the old joke, \\"What do you call 10,000 lawyers at the bottom of the ocean?\\". I would have preferred the ending to have gone a little differently, I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't watched it, but I think Butler's character wouldn't have been stopped quite like he was.    All in all, the theme is dark but the action and acting are a plus. This is entertaining and if you are up to it, maybe it will start you thinking about how the legal system in the US works. Should we really be making deals with murderers and rapists? And what part do we all play in this deal making?
B001UV4XUG|5.0|First I'm drawn to projects with Gordon-Levitt because I think he's a good bean of an actor.  I thought this might be a chick-flick but watched it anyway and was pleasantly rewarded with some good performances and a good script.  I didn't care for the lead actress so much, but I got over that.  A fun movie to watch and enjoy and I like the way it was edited and presented.  A nice change of pace.  Well done.  I think you should give it a shot.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Not sure where to start, from the beginning James has been without doubt receiving inspiration from the universe! This not James' first inspiration, but it is remarkable in the light of what science is finding out about the universe and how it works.    Those of you who maybe skeptical, just know that the world that James created has foundation in current earth research on how the universe, our planet and all its diversity (including us) functions and is connected. The research on mono-atomic elements, \\"There are many mysterious and magical things that have been recorded in history. The Biblical manna, the Philosopher's Stone, the Fountain of Youth, Orgone energy, prana, chi, the Holy Grail, the Great Pyramid and the Ark of the Covenant are a few of these things. It looks like these things and more might be related to a new class of materials that have been identified and described in the last few decades. In the late 1970s an Arizona farmer named David Hudson noticed some very strange materials as he was doing some gold mining on his land.  Hudson spent several million dollars over the following decade figuring out how to obtain and work with these strange materials. In 1989 David Hudson was granted patents on these materials and methods for obtaining them.(1)    Other researchers were also making similar discoveries around this same time but Hudson was the first to get information out to the public about his discoveries. During the early 1990s Hudson toured the United States giving lectures and workshops about what he had found. Transcripts of portions of three of David Hudson's lectures are available on the Web. The most complete of these transcripts is the transcript of his Dallas lecture and workshop.(2)    The materials that David Hudson discovered appear to be related to the things I listed in the first paragraph of this article and to concepts of modern physics like superconductivity, quantum coherence and Bose-Einstein condensates.\\"  By Barry Carter      The best part is that Ormus is in minerals, plants, water, animals, and us,it is in everything.  The Ormus actually a ceramic-mono-atomic according to quantum-physics has the ability to be in the physical world and the non physical world simultaneously, and because it is highly PHOTONIC in nature, a mountain spring deep in the mountains of N.C. scared water to native Indians of that area doesn't need to be pump out of the ground it's natural flows up toward the sun because of it's Ormus level is high, rich in this mono-atomic element.      SOOO the floating Mountains of Pandora, are in line with the science of Ormus.  The connection between the NAVI and their natural surroundings much like our own indigenous people of this earth is both insightful and based in the most advance science and findings on our blue planet.           Then I have to say that he put it all together as a great story teller, and illustrator, as a entertaining, inspiring, and prophetic genius would...as for the film technology and visual fun...that was really great also, but secondary to his profound imaginative and visionary stories, just as in the Abyss James sees and feels all the connections in AVATAR. He also understands that story telling about how the characters are developed and how they connect...if I can not relate to them, it is just another action film. Not sure how much of this he realizes (I think more than he talks about), in his interviews he doesn't get into it quite in the way that I have described, maybe because he does not want to be view this way, but rather as a talented writer, illustrator and movie maker.  And I am not look to elevate him to some cult status, as I believe we all, everyone of has the ability to connect beyond space and time and know as Einstein expressed his desire \\"to know the mind of God\\"  we all have it within us to know the mind of the Universe, so those of us who are passionate we can do this also, James just seems to tap in more easily than others.  He has let go of the destructive filters that prevent us from receiving these wonderful messages from the universe about how it works and who we are.     Congrats to James, well done, well done!  If you have not seen this MOVIE AVATAR...you must see it!  If it doesn't inspire you, you are not awake...
1591841666|4.0|I think I got more out of this book than some of the other reviewers because I read it at just the right time in my life...when I needed all of these \\"reminders\\" the most.  I saw a couple of reviewers say that it is more of an inspirational book than a how-to book - I'd agree with that.  And I saw others that said it wasn't all that original - I'd agree with that, too.  For me, the book was 1) Just the right length, anything longer would have been too much of the same-old, same-old.  The length was perfect to keep my attention and provide me with the kick in the pants I needed.  2) Just the right kind of reminder I needed when I read it.  Maybe the title is a bit misleading...I still do not consider the time I spent reading this book a waste of my time.  I've even given this book to a couple of other co-workers who seemed stuck in a rut, and I know that one of them passed it along to her son.  Take it for what it is; get out of it what you need to.

B002QEXN2K|4.0|How do you follow up the perfection that is Continuum? That was such a perfect record for John Mayer, capturing all that makes him one of the best mainstream artists going. His songwriting, his guitar playing, his ability to mix mellower tones with bluesy ones. It was a huge triumph. So again I ask, how do you follow that up? Well, Mayer releases Battle Studies, a combination of Continuum and Heavier Things, it seems to me. I like the angle he played upon with the overall theme of the album, that love equals war, basically. But if you're expecting a continuation of Continuum, with more guitar playing, you're going to be disappointed. This record seems mellower to me than Continuum, but I don't have a problem with that. You get the mellow yet epic Heartbreak Warfare, with its great chorus, and an interesting choice for an album opener. You get the very catchy and groovy Perfectly Lonely, which is my personal favorite on the album. You get Who Says, with its laidback feel that recalls Stop This Train in its musical composition. There's also his reworking of the classic Clapton/Cream cover of Robert Johnson's Crossroads, which is a little slower and funkier than the Cream version it is based upon. Another favorite is Assassin, with its epic feel, cool lyrics, and intense guitar work. And let's not forget Half Of My Heart, the duet with Taylor Swift. I wouldn't call this a duet, she basically back-up sings and has a short call and response with him. That aside, it's a great song, with one of my favorite lines on the album: \\"Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring.\\"    I think what we're seeing here is John Mayer is the type of artist that is going to be unpredictable. And I like that in an artist. Battle Studies is a solid album, but it has the misfortune of being placed after Continuum. It's definitely an interesting record, and it keeps me waiting to see what he's going to do next.

B0025KVLUQ|5.0|What else do you expect? This is Abbey Road we're talking about here. This to me is the Beatles at their best. Come Together, Something, Octopus's Garden, Here Comes The Sun, She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, Carry That Weight, The End. Talk about ending on a high note. They were as far away from each other as they ever were, but I think it really worked to their benefit. They jump from different styles where they don't get stuck in one place. And I love that it gives all four a great chance to shine. George was clearly just blossoming as a songwriter, I mean Here Comes The Sun is one of those songs that is just so perfect. This is truly their masterpiece, no offense to Sgt. Pepper's.<br /><br />As for the remaster, I love it. I love the richness and the fullness that the quality has. And I like that the volume hasn't been pushed to the point of distortion, like a lot of releases these days do. It's just a very natural sounding remaster. I won't say whether it sounds like the LP or not, but I do know that it sounds awesome.

The music numbers esp. are really good, some actors I never imagined could sing, surprised me, because they could.

B000002HRE|3.0|Re-Load is actually a lot better than the first Load. They got some of their heavy metal roots back and some of the songs are faster paced. They got some of the speed back, it also has some slower and heavier songs like Where the Wild Things Are and Devils Dance. Fuel is another good hit but The Memory Remains is one of my all time favorite Metallica songs. Re-Load is heavier and has less southern rock in it but it would never live up to their classics from the '80s. Bands change and aren't going to make the same thing with every album but Re-Load has a lot of what Load was lacking.
0446567337|5.0|This is another great novel by Nicholas Sparks! I was really looking forward to reading it since the movie is coming out soon. I really enjoyed the read and had a hard time putting it down! It's very easy to read and I loved the story. There are many issues in this novel besides love, including sacrifice and the developing relationship between John and his father. I would have liked to have heard from Savannah's point of view because the whole novel is from John's. There is still some mystery to her character that I wish Sparks would have explored. However, it was still an amazing read! I definitely recommend you read this novel, even though the ending leaves you wanting more. An amazing, fitting ending that leaves you speechless!

B000001EUR|4.0|Very worthy recording by these German Rockers.  Many of the songs are heavy guitar driven.  However, there are some little ubtle touches that make this recording stand out a bit.  One is the beautiful closing ballad Still Loving You.  What an awesome tune from the lyrics on down to the singing as well as the guitar interplay.  One of my all time favorite heavy metal ballads.<br /><br />Two is the dynamic guitar riffs that open up many of the tunes particularly the signature Rock You Like A Hurricane, Big City Night, and Bad Boys Running Wild.  A third would be the gentle guitar pasage of Comming Home.  Truthfullu I would have liked for that song to be a ballad all the way thru.  A fourth stand out moment would be the drum beat on Crossfire.  Very unconventional beats especially for a metal band.<br /><br />Nonetheles, Love At First Sting is onsistent throughout and is truly an enjoyable experience.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I have to say that the Playstation controllers have basically stayed the same since the PS1 and I am ok with that. The controller fits comfortably in the hand and isn't overly complex. The controls work smoothly and are very responsive. The pressure sensitive buttons are great. The return of the 'Dualshock' technology was long overdue, why it wasn't included in the initial launch of the PS3 is just a mystery to me. The SixAxis controls are ok, just an attempt to capitalize on the Wii's motion control fame.       Pros:   Same controller you played with for years.   Return of rumble feature   Durable     Cons:   'Motion' controls   Cost!
B0025KVLS8|2.0|This review is not about the album itself, which is a must have, but about the newly released remastered version. This album along with much of the early Beatle's catalogue was originally intended to be heard in monophonic sound which was the standard of the industry at the time.  The Beatles were present for the original mono mixes but It was later that the stereo versions were created and the result was often very poor.  For some reason the music itself was affected, with different arrangements of harmonica, lead guitar and echo/reverb effects etc....even the song structure as different takes were used.  I am not sure why they did this.  For devotees, the mono versions have always been considered superior for this reason.  I was hoping that with today's technology a truly good stereo mix could be made.  After all, there is software now that allows one to isolate a voice or bass line to create a new and separate track from a mono recording, so theoretically, new  truly stereo mixes could be made.  This technique was used to create the Beatles Rockband game after all and I expected much more from these new releases.  After listening to this new stereo version, there are no improvements to the original poor-quality stereo mixes at all, and I have no idea why they didn't take the time to do it while George Martin, Paul and Ringo are still here.  Maybe there is still some technological problem that I am unaware of, but they have done marvelous things with the Yellow Submarine Songtrack so i was expecting a lot more.  When the Beatles catalogue was first released on CD George Martin decided to release the first four albums in their original monophonic form, because that is how they were intended to be heard by he and the Beatles and the existing stereo mixes sounded terrible.  Unfortunately that is still the case here.  All that was done here as far as remastering that i can tell is that the loudness is turned up and the bass is louder--or boomier depending on your taste.  Two tracks are very offensive and it bothers me to no end that these nasty versions may now become the standard.  First is &#34;If I Fell&#34; which, for some reason has an inferior vocal track in which Paul's voice glaringly cracks on the high note of &#34;was in vain.&#34;  This flaw is not present on the mono mix.  Paul would have never selected that take!  Also, John's solo introduction is double tracked.  He obviously didn't intend this since the mono version which he approved of doesn't have it, and the two takes they used in the stereo mix to create the double tracking don't line up--it sounds like he is in a cave somewhere. If he had wanted it that way he would have been careful to sing it the same way both times. The other offense is &#34;I Should Have Known Better&#34; in which the harmonica cuts out, as John runs out of breath, in the introduction.  This again is not present in the original monophonic version.  Why not take the opportunity to make some repairs?  How about getting it right?  I will continue to listen to my old mono CD instead of this one.  Although &#34;monophonic&#34; to many connotes an inferior quality, they really sound quite crisp and clean--it is just that the same sound comes out of each speaker.  There is no tinnyness that one associates with very old recordings from say the 1940's.  In fairness, the packaging on this new series is first rate and makes the buy almost worth it, but when I think of what could've been achieved I am left scratching my head except to think that they want to release the catalogue again later on in some still more improved version.  Curiously, I do find some of the stereo versions superior on other Beatle albums.  For example, &#34;From Me to You&#34; is much better in stereo, because the harmonica at the beginning has been removed {Again why the difference?).  I always found the old mono version to be irritatingly piercing.  &#34;I call Your Name&#34; has a more nimble and musical lead guitar line from George and &#34;Thank You Girl&#34; has more harmonica echoing the line &#34;too good to be true&#34; So I enjoyed the new remastered &#34;Past Masters.&#34;  However &#34;Paperback Writer&#34; still begins, annoyingly, with the drums panned all the way to the left speaker.    This particular album is made worse in the stereo version, for the two songs mentioned above--the rest of the album is okay.  I would not buy this unless you want the packaging. I am quite bothered that they would make no effort to improve these stereo mixes, which everyone knows stink, and simply remaster this junk.  I can only predict a yet more &#34;improved&#34; release 20 years down the road. I was bummed out.  Addendum.  As predicted they are now releasing &#34;remixes&#34; of the Beatles catalogue starting with &#34;1&#34; and now &#34;Sgt Pepper&#34; 2017.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Can someone tell me what this movie was about?   The plot (if there WAS one) was totally feeble and disjointed compared to the iconic Term 2 which I could watch again and again (and have done) in spite of Edward Furlong's obnoxious portrayal of the young John Connor.  There's really nothing I can say about this latest Terminator effort except that it should have been TERMINATED.  One HUGE disappointment. Sorry - I WON'T \\"be back\\" if this is the best they can do!!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I think the characters for the Austen parts were well matched.  Just another way to enjoy Pride and Prejudice.

If you are a fan, this is worth seeing.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I remember my parents showing this movie to me when I was about 5 or 6 (I'm 16 now), and I remember loving it then.  In 2003 I was so excited that the broadway revival was coming to my area and I was soo excited to see it!  We had our tickets and everything but for some strange reason, the show got cancelled!  We recently moved to a new city and I was so excited when I heard that my high school was putting on a production of Little Shop!  Having been in choir for 6 years and having a fairly good acting career, I was so sure that I would get a part and I did!  I got Seymour (the lead)!      After reading some of the reviews about this dvd, some people said that it had the original broadway ending, but I haven't watched the one I bought yet.  Even though I know how it is supposed to end (with Seymour and Audrey dying), I still want to see it!      I love the cast of this movie, and I think that they cast very well!    A classic that you must own for yourself!!!

B0015DROBO|2.0|I read it.  I did stay up too late to finish it. I enjoyed the Lisbeth Salander character - I was rooting for her.  The whole book is full of gratuitous sexual violence under the guise of alerting people to the prevalence of the horrible problem. I can only guess the second book, which touches on human trafficking has more of the same.<br />Not to mention the haphazard way Lisbeth is diagnosed w/ Aspberger syndrom.<br />The writing can be dull, it reminds me of the Sue Grafton mysteries - if you took out Kinsy's observations of \\"the bougainvilleas hanging on the awning moving in the wind\\" - you would wind up w/ a 60 page book.<br />Mr. Larsson includes an ASTOUNDING amount of making coffee and eating sandwiches.<br /><br />I am going to take the high road, and not find out what happens to Lisbeth - fool me once, but I am not going to read the other two - these books are getting way too much push. For no good reason.

The focus in on techniques and begins with an informative survey of imaginative paintings beginning with the Renaissance and going on through to the Golden Age of American illustration. With an emphasis on the necessity for attention to such details as architecture and anatomy, \\"Imaginative Realism\\" is an invaluable and highly recommended instruction guide for anyone wanting to create images suitable for books, magazines, calendars, video games, films, toys, and gallery quality wall art.
B00004T0UT|4.0|Because of the fact that Elvis Presley burst on the scene during the era in which 45-rpm singles reigned supreme, many of his albums (and just about everyone else's albums) tended to revolve around the hits and include less-than-stellar filler.  As everyone knows, Col. Tom Parker tried to turn his star into a pop singer with a broader appeal, something that is apparent from Presley's movie appearances and his recordings after his return from the Army.  The 1968 comeback television special marked the return of Elvis Presley to relevance, and From Elvis in Memphis pretty much seals the deal.  The CD reissue is far superior to the original vinyl release because of the important 1969 singles (particularly \\"Kentucky Rain\\" and \\"Suspicious Minds\\") that are included as bonus tracks.  Most of the arrangements lean in the direction of pop, particularly because of the inclusion of strings; however, this represents perhaps the best example of how Elvis Presley integrated blues, country, pop, and even soul in the late 1960s.  If only he had sung this way and more soulful material during the rest of the 1960s -- his catalog of recordings probably would have been much more interesting overall.  And, if only he had not become a self parody in the 1970s...  Anyway, this is probably Elvis Presley's best album, especially in the enlarged form of the reissue.
B002NXSRX4|2.0|Sad what they did, all the budget and computing power you could want, and this is the film that gets made.  Not the Casts fault, just a painfully shallow plot, stilted dialog, blech.  Felt like a Star Wars prequel, just horribly done.<br /><br />Disappointed.
B00024I0OC|4.0|Before Chris Farlowe joined this band on [[ASIN:B0002HV64U Daughter of Time]], this band was a progressive blues unit, Dick Haskell Smith and others in the Colosieum working with Jack Bruce and John Mayall.<br /><br />Someone very smart must have heard how good these guys were, because they were in the first round of bands signed to the new beeming Vertigo Records in 1969. (Blue Ribbon for anyone who can name the others)<br /><br />These guys play blues inflected with jazz and hard rock. \\"The Kettle\\" kicks the doors down with its crunch. \\"Walking In The Park\\" is more straight jazz blues, but played with rock hunger. Things get more sophistacated with the title track, which is a long art rock piece that mixes many parts, but has more to do with the same blues and jazz cornerstones than the classical pretense that later infected art rock.<br /><br />All of this is great. This band goes a lot of ways, but wherever you follow, you will never loose.
0545128285|4.0|THREE QUICK POINTS:<br />* Point 1: This was a quick read. Coming in at roughly 100 pages, with good spacing, margins, and font size, it could be lazily read in a couple hours or less.<br /><br />* Point 2: Ms. Rowling channeled the bard himself. The book is not like reading a Harry Potter book, it's like reading someone else's text and stories whereas J.K.R. just interjects a few footnotes. (Totally cute.)<br /><br />* Point 3: J.K. Rowling is a skilled illustrator. Illustrations appear throughout the book, and though they have the wispy quality of doodles, they are quite well done and add to the book's atmosphere.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS:<br />This book is a collection of five fairytales, generally for the magical population. Each tale, translated by Hermione, is followed by notes made by Dumbledore. In some cases, JKR even inserts a footnote of her own when she felt it necessary to explain a magical term as: \\"Professor Dumbledore appears to have been writing for a Wizarding audience....\\"<br /><br />The fairytales include: The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, The Fountain of Fair Fortune, The Warlock's Hairy Heart, Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump, and The Tale of the Three Brothers.<br /><br />(If you care to read a summation of each story/Dumbledore's notes, you can check out the unabridged review on my blog.)<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />I immediately thought of The Brothers Grimm while reading some of the stories, except the stories are told from a magical point of view as opposed to human (or Muggle as the case may be).<br /><br />Let me start off by saying: people expecting another \\"Harry Potter book\\" will be sadly disappointed. The Tales of Beedle the Bard is, as the title implies, a collection of tales created by a bard named Beedle, not a book about Harry Potter by J. K. Rowling.<br /><br />Once you get past that, the book itself is quite entertaining. Some areas made me laugh out loud, especially a section in the story of Babbitty Rabbitty and some of Dumbledore's commentary throughout.<br /><br />Each tale reminded me of some Muggle version of a story, either from the Brothers Grimm or from other cautionary tales (for instance, The Monkey's Paw). That allowed me to connect on a more personal level with the stories and the lessons they aimed to teach young witches and wizards. It made me feel like they were just like me. But I did find it a little disheartening when one of the footnotes proclaimed there was no hope for humans who wanted to be a witch or wizard.<br /><br />For me, the most entertaining story was Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump, but as with Dumbledore, the one which left the most profound impression was The Three Brothers (and The Warlock's Hairy Heart was just plain disturbing).<br /><br />The story of the three brothers was a reminder that we must all meet our maker some day and trying to circumvent death is futile (and, tongue in cheek, never trust Death).<br /><br />One big gripe I did have with the book comes with the inclusion of the illustrations. From the images shown at Amazon, done for each story, it was apparent that they weren't all rendered for the standard edition of the book (and I'm not talking about the \\"10 exclusive\\" images either); it's as though new illustrations were done specifically for the standard edition. (Not entirely sure if it's the same deal with the deluxe version.)<br /><br />But that quibble is minor in the grand scheme and crafting a creative fable is not the easiest thing to do, so she definitely deserves some accolades for the stories themselves, and I truly wish there had been more.

B001AVCFJM|1.0|This movie is not Star Trek by any definition.  Rather this film is a reflection of todays \\"pop-culture\\" as dumbed down as ever.  Not too much thought was put into this movie as it followed a very simple and common formula for films today.  Take a known brand \\"Start Trek\\" subtract all of the complex and intriguing script writing, add copious special effects, add a good measure of sexual scenes and then reduce the dialogue until it sounds as dumbed down as common modern American vernacular.  Now blitz the media with as much hype and pomp as you can possibly conjure up. Serve while still warm to pop-culture drones and unsuspecting loyalists to a now exploited brand.  Net result, make a few bucks with mixed reviews and move on to the next \\"horror\\" film...  Your fellow nepotists at your local film factory will be satisfied regardless.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Truly the unique movie that has thoroughly divided audiences, Closer is either hated or loved. I tend towards the latter although I didn't love it. I can, however, appreciate the many qualities the movie has.<br />Let me start by taking on the many critics who claim, with stunning arrogance, that the movie is unrealistic, or that these things never happen, or that these people are so vile that the movie isn't worth the time to watch. You couldn't be farther from the truth. First of all, the events these characters go through certainly do happen, even if comprehending such stark brutality makes you dangerously self-conscious and uncomfortable. It's one thing to dislike a movie because you found it distasteful; it's another to try to cover all of human experience with the narrow blanket made up of your own limited life and stifled imagination. Secondly, the utterly repellent nature of their actions doesn't make the movie unworthy of the time one spends watching it, even if there are terribly painful moments to endure.<br />The four characters that make up this intense drama are cold blooded, unforgiving, self-destructive, selfish, and unable to distinguish between love and her twisted counter-ego, obsession. Clive Owen is the best part of this movie, from the moment we meet him through his confrontation with Jude Law, he is a boiling, sarcastic, and ruthless mess of a man. Matter of fact, no one in this movie is very likable, even the manipulative Alice, who from her name on down to her perfectly fitting occupation, rarely plays people honestly. She tries to play herself as this wounded victim, but she has more on the ball than she's given credit for. Witness the scene at the photography studio. Roberts and Law have the far less sympathetic roles to play; and Roberts plays hers emotionally detached and self-loathingly. Law is the romantic fool who doesn't know what he wants because he is emotionally immature.<br />Closer is a movie that I would not recommend to the easily offended, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot. For those of you, I'm sure there's something on Fox News Channel you'd enjoy much more than this movie. Just don't take a wrong turn and uncover Bill O'Reilly's Jenna Jameson collection.<br />I would definitely recommend it for struggling couples, those contemplating divorce, or singles who never seem to be able to make relationships work. There are plenty of lessons these tortured characters can teach and I'm guessing that you'll see some of yourself in these four and their repeated mistakes. If you want to know the hell of a relationship's demise, or see how not knowing yourself handicaps your ability to successfully love and be loved in return, put on Closer, hold your breath, and open your eyes wide.ded, the people who are uncomfortable with frank sexual discussion, or those who don't enjoy character studies with no real plot.

B002TZS4W0|4.0|Updated 5-3-2010: For those of you who are new to Helloween, or old fans that are thinking this may be a nice, updated greatest hits CD, it is a whole lot more than that. I currently have the Japanese release of this, and it is 11 tracks, around 60 minutes of many of their best songs re-worked into orchestra and choir (adult and childrens). There is also a DVD 30 minutes on the making of this album.  A couple of them almost come of with a folk type sound, like the track Eagle Fly Free.  Many of the orchestra sounds have been \\"done\\" before by other bands (Scorpions, Metallica, Deep Purple, Ect...), and are mixed well, but would not stand out as original.  Much of the Keepers Trilogy sounds like it could be a movie soundtrack at times, and could be laid overtop of a live action performance story about the tracks. There is even a hint of pop sound here.  Favorite songs are Perfect Gentleman, Eagle Fly Free, and Keepers Trilogy.  This is for the hardcore fans only though, and can be seen as a good thank you to fans who have grown up with their music over the last 25 years.   This is not likely to be at the top of most thrash/power metal fans playlists.  However, as pointed out in discussions after my original posting, this album could be an access point for people who may not have ventured into this genre before.  Worth a few spins in the CD player.
B00000J7SS|4.0|Bitches Brew<br />Miles Davis<br /><br />Released in 1970, Bitches Brew is a controversial album.  Some have lauded it while at the same time criticizing it, \\"The Penguin Guide to Jazz gave Bitches Brew a four-star rating (out of four stars) describing the recording as `one of the most remarkable creative statements of the last half-century, in any artistic form. It is also profoundly flawed, a gigantic torso of burstingly noisy music that absolutely refuses to resolve itself under any recognized guise.'\\" (Quote from Wiki article \\"Bitches Brew\\").<br /><br />I've listened to this CD off and on (mostly off) for more than a decade.  It is just starting to be easy on these ears.  I like my jazz \\"Kind of Blue\\" and only that way, really.  That is, easy, continuous rhythms.  Bitches Brew is discordant and discontinuous.  \\"One critic writes that `Davis drew a line in the sand that some jazz fans have never crossed, or even forgiven Davis for drawing.' Bob Rusch recalls, `this to me was not great Black music, but I cynically saw it as part and parcel of the commercial crap that was beginning to choke and bastardize the catalogs of such dependable companies as Blue Note and Prestige.... I hear it 'better' today because there is now so much music that is worse.'\\" (Quote from Wiki article, \\"Britches Brew\\").<br /><br />Miles introduced the Jazz world to what has come to be called Jazz Rock.  It still doesn't make a lot of sense to me, but I can enjoy it all the way through now.  When I first listened, I put it away not making it through the 1st disc.  A year later I picked it back up and listened through the 2nd disc in its entirety, skipping the 1st one.  It was only years later that I was able to get through both discs and this at some loss of pleasure.  This last time, I put my iPod in its player (mStation) and really couldn't tell, all that much, what it was that bothered me.  I heard what I didn't like originally in disc 1, but I enjoyed it more.  Maybe it's because the other times, I was ready to let my senses be transported by the music.  I didn't like where Bitches Brew took me, initially.  This last time (1/15/10) I was in my office working.  Maybe for me Bitches Brew is good background music.  I'm not sure what that says about me or the music, but it is what it is.<br /><br />If you are a jazz aficionado, surely you have this work of art.

0786868724|4.0|This is a nice sentimental story about Mitch Albom's long relationship with his rabbi and his shorter relationship with a Christian pastor.  The rabbi, as he was approaching old age, asked Albom to do his eulogy when the time came.  So Albom visited the rabbi many times to get to know him better, commuting from Detroit.  I never quite understood why Albom didn't find a new synagogue when he moved hundreds of miles away to Detroit.    Albom slips in his own theological view.  He believes in pluralism.  \\"I preferred figures like Rajchandra, the Indian poet who influenced Gandhi by teaching that no religion was superior because they all brought people closer to God\\" (page 159).  That's where he gets in trouble with some reviewers who gave him one star.  I don't agree with pluralism, but it doesn't make it a one star book.  There are really only a few sentences in the whole book that advocate pluralism.  Albom just throws out his view of pluralism, with no valid justification.  He does say \\"Most religions warn against war, yet more wars have been fought over religion than perhaps anything else.\\"  (Page 90.)  That would be an objective reason for pluralism if it were true.  I don't believe it is true.  I can't think of a religious war prior to about 600 A.D.  If you count communism as a religion, and if you only look at the last 1400 years, his claim might be true.    Albom carelessly wrote \\"The apostle Paul asks `What must I do to be saved?'\\" (Page 107.)  Paul did not ask this.  The Philippian jailer asked Paul this question, as Luke wrote in Acts 16:30.    I have not read Tuesdays with Morrie.  Some reviewers gave HALF a bad review because they read TWM, and thought that HALF was a poor attempt to write a second TWM.    If pluralism deeply upsets you, this book will annoy you, and you will not enjoy it.  If you disagree with pluralism without getting upset about it, you might enjoy this book.  If you believe in pluralism, you will like this book a lot.
0312370849|3.0|I enjoyed Sarah's story much more that Julia's.  A bit predictable toward the end.  I would have just enjoyed a novel about Sarah's life.  The history was so much more complex and much more interesting to read ....
0446402389|5.0|What an impressive debut novel.  \\"Child 44\\" has great plotting, deft writing and a unique time and setting.  Who would have ever thought an MGB officer working in Stalinist Russia could be so appealing. Tom Rob Smith is a young writer with a great future in front of him.  I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.  Highly recommended.
B002WTC92E|1.0|I am seconding what I've read in the some of the other one star reviews. This venture is a big disappointment...in fact, if it wasn't for the success of the Devil Wears Prada, Weisberger probably wouldn't have been able to publish this. I was expecting a light read that was fun and a distraction from the everyday...instead, this book drags, jumps around, and the heroines are unsympathetic, whiny, and obnoxious. Like some of the other reviewers stated, I as well cannot see what the glue is that holds these women together in friendship. They don't seem to have anything in common except the same desperation to snag a rich guy and get married.
0143038419|1.0|Let me start by saying that Elizabeth Gilbert knows how to write and does a fine job explaining quirky situations and describing the scenery and people she meets.  She is a skilled writer, but a flake.    I'd feel more inspired by a story such as this if the writer had truly taken a life risk by making the choice to spend the year in these places.  How hard can it be to know you have money in the bank and the comfort to travel where you want to, when you want to?  Finding happiness is never easy, but finding it when you have financial security is far easier.  There is nothing so amazing in this - she is a flake in dire need of answers and seeks answers from everyone around her rather than really looking inward.  How is it everyone else around her is self-actualized?  She is simply in awe of people that are secure in their own skin.  My advice to her - stop trying so hard and try finding happiness in reality not the fantasy world you think it must be hiding in.      Enjoy the writing - but realize she is just as imperfect as the rest of us. I was bored with her self-discovery or continuing pursuit of it.  Now she's an expert on marriage - HA! She's not an expert on anything, but she is a fine writer.      Enjoy the book for that fact alone - but don't make any major life decisions with her as your mentor.  You'll find yourself next to her helping her be happy while you sit wondering if her empty vessel will ever get filled.  It won't.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I guess I really dont get why so many ppl trash this movie, sure it's not perfect (how many are?), but it is a great action movie in my opinion and I was entertained by it. I like many of you am also a fan of the terminator series and yes I know T2 rocked and was the best. Is it b/c Arnold is no longer there, except in the cgi form (which I thought looked really fake and they couldve left out) or perhaps b/c James Cameron didn't direct it? Personally I judge it on its own accord (new actors/new director) rather than comparing it to previous Terminator movies.<br /><br />I liked Mr. Bale as Connor, he did a pretty good job. I liked the story line w/ Marcus revolting and helping to save Connor and the resistance and Connor risking everything to save his teenage future dad from skynet. The action scenes were really intense and the movie does have a modern/futuristic feel to it which is cool. Although I wish the movie was longer, 1 hr 45 minutes(approx.) just seems too short in my opinion, it would've been better say at 2hrs 15 minutes or so and thus allowed for a bit more depth & character development. I dont like the clean PG-13 rating. I would like it to be more violent, bloody, gory, gritty, etc. staying true to a real war situation. Overall, I'm glad they made this movie, it gives the series new legs, and I look forward to more.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Setting of the story is Afghanistan during the past 30 years.  Primarily shows the plight of women and families during these troubled times.  A riveting well written but painful story, showing the struggles and trials of ordinary people during the Russian occupation and subsequent internal struggles culminating with the Taliban take over and downfall.  The author has intimate knowledge of the area and the people.  This book evokes empathy for the people of Afghanistan.
0312965788|5.0|James Herriot's first memoir, All Creatures Great and Small, provides the reader with wonderful true stories about the author's experiences as a veterinarian, fresh out of college, and his involvement with animals, their owners, and his colleagues, set in the picturesque Yorkshire hills of central England.<br /><br />This is a phenomenally interesting book, focusing not only on the creatures (all sizes, ages and conditions of dogs, cats, farm animals, and so on), but also the interesting characters, which owned these animals, and the amazing work that was done by vets in the days just prior to World War II in England.  All Creatures Great and Small is a warm, often hilarious narrative, written in the first-person by this wonderful author.  See for yourself why millions of people have purchased and loved this book as their own!
B000W93CHC|5.0|A continuation of Pillars of the Earth.  This is the story of the people of the area of the great cathedral 200 years later.  It takes place in 14th century England.    Numerous interrelated stories of the lives of various classes of people  Four children, one a thief, one a bully, one a young genius and one a girl who wants to be a doctor go into the forest.  They see two men killed.  The story follows their lives and shows the interaction and trials of surfs, nobility, freeholders, business people and the clergy.    This is a long book but very well written.  It never drags at least for me.  For someone not interested in the details of construction of buildings, bridges and machines there may be a few spots that lack interest but it is mostly about interpersonal relationships and intrigue.    England invades France in retaliation for raids on coastal English towns.  The plague wrecks havoc with the population and the economy.    This work gets my highest recommendation.
0679746323|5.0|Jung Chang's \\"The Unknown Story: Mao\\" is one of the best books about Chinese Communism ever written. Not only is it factual and displays excellent research using many primary sources, but it is very readable and interesting.    Being a truthful account of Mao's blame for so many terrible things that happened in China has been well documented without a shadow of doubt.  I particulary enjoy how Chang has completely debunked the old Luding bridge crossing \\"battle\\" at the Dadu River. As she demonstrates, it simply did not happen and was a Communist propaganda lie that was even perpetuated by Edgar Snow.    If you want the real scoop on Mao, read his book and it will be obvious what a vicious immoral brute he was that murdered millions.
0316001821|1.0|Around the middle of TLB, I realized that I was reading two different books mushed together by a persistent narrator (who just happens to be omniscient and first person at the same time, oh how clever!).<br /><br />The first half of the book reads like a kind of mystery novel in which the reader knows the identity of the villain that the characters are trying to discover.  I though this was a fairly interesting approach, especially since there were very few clues to direct the characters.  I must say though that I was grossly disappointed by the fact that Mr. Salmon \\"figures out\\" who-done-it by using his spidey-sense rather than actually piecing together the mystery or, you know, detecting.  I get it.  The real world is hard, and cases go unresolved.  But, to offer the reader a resolved case, including the deus ex machina ending and a sense of semi-closure, seems to miss the point about the impossibility of resolution in favor of a watered down sentimentality.<br /><br />The second face of the novel is the ghost story.  Much like the mystery aspect, the ghost story leaves the reader unsatisfied.  Several times the reader is told that Susie is effecting the world (or at least the feelings of her family members and friends), but this never manifests in any concrete way until the creepy body-snatchers sex scene (which, by the way, can be read as another type of rape since Ruth can't possibly consent).  The fact that TLB was more about emotional haunting than the supernatural would have been interesting if not for the ridiculous insertions of sappy afterlife moments (like Susie meeting up with her dog in the afterlife, or the inexplicable presence of utterly forgettable characters like Holly/Whatshername).<br /><br />On another note the word \\"toothsome\\" means delicious, so the \\"blind, nosy, toothsome\\" moles are apparently good eating.  I know its nitpicking, but every time I read a sentence in Yoda-ese or an inappropriate word choice all I could think of was how much this book wanted to be good literature, but couldn't pull it off.<br /><br />The final complaint I have about this novel is that I was under the impression that Orientalism was out of fashion since, oh say, the turn of the century.  Apparently someone needs to tell Sebold that.  If I had to read about Ray or his mother's exotic, asexual, beauty one more time I might have screamed.is book wanted to be good literature, but couldn't pull it off.<br /><br />The final complaint I have about this novel is that I was under the impression that Orientalism was out of fashion since, oh say, the turn of the century.

B002XGRSBI|5.0|I saw Paul McCartney in Las Vegas about 4 years ago and this is just like being there again. This is worth every penny X 10! The packaging is absolutely amazing. It's a small (7.5\\" X 5.75\\") hard cover book full of beautiful pictures and even a baseball card of Paul is included. Paul and the band have non-stop energy and the Las Vegas concert was about 3 hours! This is a 5 star concert from a 5 star musician/entertainer. Get this Deluxe version, 2 DVDs, 2 CDs and you won't be sorry. It's much cheaper than tickets to a concert and this is like you're there.
B002S9DRAG|3.0|No one mounted to the rooftops to shout \\"the French are coming, the French are coming,\\" yet somehow we have enjoyed a veritable invasion of French and French-based pianists (Aimard, Thibaudet,Angelich, Grimaud, et al.). In number they outstrip their German and Italian rivals, which is rather amazing, since French pianism has hardly been dominant on the international scene in the past (Casadesus over Kempff? Hardly.) Among the most lauded of the younger generation is 31-year-old Alexandre Tharaud, whose earlier Chopin disc won raves in high places.<br /><br />I am not in a high place, so I'm free to say that he doesn't bowl me over. Tharaud is typed as an intellectual musician, and to be sure, there's more calculation in his approach than emotinal sweep. His Chopin is full of eccentric starts and stops and broken phrases, all done with taste and total lack of exaggeration.  But at a certain point this kind of intelligent fussiness, if I can call it that, is crazy-making. Tharaud can't let two bars go by naturally; he micromanages literally every beat. Horowitz did the same on a grand scale. Apparently grandness is out, but the same nervous tinkering is praised on a small scale. On this whole disc, nothing sounded right to me except the Mazurkas, whose off-kilter rhythms suit Tharaud's off-kilter temperament.<br /><br />As a test case, I urge you to try the Ballade no. 1, comparing Tharaud's inward, highly personal  style with the sweep of Kissin, the natural instincts of Ax, or the aristocratic power of Pollini.  No doubt Tharaud has as much to say in this music as any rising pianist, but he speaks in a language too skewed for me.
B001NYVY8O|4.0|This is a classic album in it's genre in my opinion.  I'll never understand why so many people hated on this CD.  I like it just as much today as I did back when it came out.  It reminds me of when I was younger so it has a little sentimental value for me as well.  Not one bad song on here.  It's got the rap, it's got the rock, it's got the pointless thrashing with ridiculous lyrics.  This is just a fun CD to put on whenever.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|Sometimes I think we get too caught up in specifications and some unreasonable expectations from the equipment we buy.     In this particular case (for my D60), I was looking for a 1) light weight flash, and 2) a simple, mount it, turn it on, and start shooting flash and 3) reasonable priced.    This fits the bill nicely. While I know no one at Nikon, I think this is designed like the old Vivitar rectangular flashes from many moons ago. If you remember those, you are as old as I am probably, YIKES!! This is better since no wires. You got to love that. I also have an ancient Vivitar 285 under my desk and I admit it feels better carrying my SB400 than feeling like I have brick in my pocket with my old Vivitar.    Portability is its strongest suit. I put this little gem in my pockets in either cargo pants or a jacket and we are set to go.    Bouncing it at 45, 60 or 90 degrees is great so long as it it not a vaulted ceiling.    Flash power is excellent for my needs. Does it light up the night sky? No, but then how do you expect a small little unit like this to have that much power short of nuclear power? I generally shoot at less than 15ft or less (contact range) and this flash works great. Some reviews say it is not as good as the SB600 or 900. Well guess what, if it was as good it would be an SB600 or 900.    There are only really three negative things I can say, 1) I wish it turned vertical but I tend not to take too many of those shots, 2) shot-to-shot recharge time can sometimes be a touch slow but not so bad that it is a deal breaker and 3) I wish they put a battery meter on it.     I use Eneloop AA rechargables and I have used this flash for almost 2 months before I needed to charge the batteries.    I know one day I will probably buy a larger flash, but this one will always be just finger tips away.
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse-Five was a building that served as a German POW camp during World War II.  Kurt Vonnegut was a prisoner there and witnessed the firebombing of Dresden.  The long lasting impressions of this incident inspired him to write a fictional story about Billy Pilgrim's experience as POW, mixing fiction with reality.       I think this novel is about the horrors of war, the sacrifice of young men who are still like children for the purpose of defending your country, and the helplessness of humans to direct their own destiny.    The author accomplishes this in a jumble of events where Billy's experiences and observations of war and encapturement are mixed with his mental time travel through his life.  Billy's time travel occurs after he was abducted by the aliens know as Tralfamidoreans on his daughter's wedding night.  He was transported to their planet for several years to be observed like an animal in a zoo.  The Tralfamidoreans believe that life occurs in 4 dimensions and whereas you cannot change how it enfolds, you can visit any moment in your life as it is occurring.  Death will not exist because you can always visit another part of your life at the same time.       Slaughterhouse-Five is a very enjoyable novel.     The sadness and horrors of war are balanced with the absurdness of Billy's postwar life and the Tralfamidorean influence.  Two things in this book have really made an impression on me. First was the terrifying reference stating \\"the candles and soap were made from the fat of rendered Jews and Gypsies and fairies and communists, and other enemies of the state\\".  This made a terrible impression on me and I really hope it is a myth.   Second was Vonnegut's repetitive \\"and so it goes\\" statement whenever someone or something dies. I like that phrase and now find myself using it quite often.  This was my first Kurt Vonnegut novel and I can't wait to read another.
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I like the Lady. She has a beautiful voice and her avant garde style is rather appealing. Still, there is nothing new or innovative here. I immediately sensed that I'd heard it all before whether it was the delivery, the beat, or the inflection. She is very reminiscent of a young Madonna and even the nasal quality of her voice evokes comparison. Alejandro could be packaged as La Isla Bonita Part II. It's not altogether a bad thing and I imagine GaGa is well aware of it. With that said, I enjoy The Fame Monster tremendously and play it often. The formula may be 25 years old but it's still a winning one.

1594488916|5.0|No matter how I try to explain the wonder of this book, my review will fall short. This book has to be experienced: A most incredible and amazing read, absolutely fascinating, totally enthralling.<br /><br />To anyone who has ever collected dolls, baseball cards, art, thimbles, spoons, cats, books or any number of items, this book will show how collecting is a sort of obsession that can cross over to addiction.<br /><br />This book is well-researched and immensely entertaining! It tells how a collector's addiction is stimulated by acquisitions, which result in the desire to add more and more items to \\"complete\\" a collection that can never be completed! It is an obsession that feeds on itself!  A frightening phenomenon!<br /><br />All of this is background for the main subject of the book: A collector, John Gilkey, who became a thief to satisfy his obsession for rare books. As his love and desire for rare books escalated, he became more devious and brilliant in his thievery.<br /><br />The book has endless numbers of fascinating characters, and I was mesmerized by the author, her sources, and the dedicated  book dealers who police rare book thievery to preserve the unique and common heritage that such books represent.<br /><br />All I can say to an inquiring mind: READ this BOOK. You will LOVE it!

B001B7CNY2|5.0|I am utterly shocked at how many poor reviews people have given this movie because they feel it's ridiculous! KNOCK KNOCK! The moment you decide to watch a movie you have asked to be entertained. That means you have willingly allowed yourself to escape reality a bit to enjoy yourself. In addition, if you didn't want to suspend reality watching U-571 you could have easily put on History Channel and/or Discovery to watch a black and white documentary of U-BOAT warfare. With that said the movie still captures what it was like serving on a submarine during WWII.<br /><br />Now that I have that off my chest...U-571 pays homage to the courageous men who served on Submarines and U-Boats during WWI and WWII. The story is wonderful and makes you feel like you are on the submarine fearing every depth charge and pulse pounding moment. The ending is wonderful and you will cheer and feel AMERICAN PRIDE! It ranks with today's modern sub classice like Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide and K-19! Enjoy!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: It looks and sounds better than ever! A true DEMO DISC! It felt like I was watching it for the first time again. The movie defaults to the U-CONTROL for some reason which gives access to making of features. This can be easily turned off. Not all special features from the DVD were carried over which is disappointing, but should not prevent you from upgrading. ABSOLUTELY WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP!

B002SJIO5E|3.0|Ok, ok....I am reading the reviews here and I love the passion although some people are either too harsh or making this out to be a masterpiece! It's not either, it is a good movie with some interesting plot lines and solid acting. The special effects are excellent and when you consider the budget was fairly small it gets high merits. The movie starts off very slow and takes some time before it really turns it up! Give it a chance, it is a very good movie.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The disc is beautiful and the sound rich. The special features are interesting and informative. Not really a 'DEMO DISC' but if you jumped to the end it can be. Worthy of ownership.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|In England during the regency era,  the Bennet family- a household of five almost grown girls, whose mother's goal arrange her daughters “advantageous” marriages to wealthy men. A new guy in town,  Mr. Bingley, rents a mansion in their area. A ball initiates attraction between Bingley and Jane, the eldest Bennet girl.<br />Of course, THIs is Lizzie’s love story. Her initial feelings are that dislike toward the seemingly arrogant Mr. Darcy But she can’t quite escape her unexplainable feelings for Darcy, and he in return continues to express interest in her. Fans of Jane Austen’s classic novel— who cherish the 1995 BBC version of of Pride and prejudice starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle—may also enjoy this version as well.<br />Lost to the two-hour running time are some of the complexities of the plot, as well as some of the great, pointed, clever exchanges of dialogue Austen is known for. Enough remains to remind us of her ability to use words as weapons and gifts in quick and equal measure. This movie is the unabashed romantic love story between Lizzie and Darcy sweetly and simply.<br /><br />The mixed British and American cast skews younger than in previous adaptations, and the whole ensemble delivers. Keira Knightley is believably sharp-witted, and Matthew MacFadyen’s stiff Darcy gradually disarms as his character is revealed. But old pros Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn shine brightest as the wise and foolish Mr. and Mrs. Bennet. It’s telling that the film’s most moving moment comes with Mr. Bennet’s reaction to Lizzie’s announcement about her true feelings for Mr. Darcy.<br /><br />Wright doesn't just capture the precision of good acting or the beauty of the English countryside, though. In addition to offering a well-crafted film that families (especially those with tweens and teens of the female persuasion) can enjoy together, he serves up Austen’s story in a way that makes it a great starting place for conversations about issues of growing up, finding a mate, history, culture and family relationships. Better, it might lure new readers to Austen’s books and other literature of the period. Not bad for the umpteenth adaptation of a nearly 200-year-old work.ues of growing up, finding a mate, history, culture and family relationships.

0312383347|3.0|I enjoyed this between book more than the previous ones, but I still don't see the purpose of doing them, other than to spotlight Diesel without much interference from Ranger and Morelli.<br /><br />I also thought, in typical JE fashion, she went overboard with things and just doesn't know when enough is too much. How many times did the monkey give someone the finger? How many times did Lula sneeze and fart? After awhile, it just started getting tedious, much the same way Grandma peeking into coffins, Papa Plum's food falling out of his mouth and Stephanie's exploding cars do in the regular series.
B001675YQ6|4.0|It was such a shame when young and vivacious Brittany Murphy died in December 2009 at age 32, depriving the film world of her sunny countenance. Along with the biopic of rapper Eminem, 8 Mile -- [[ASIN:B00005JLQE 8 Mile (Widescreen Edition)]] -- this was my favorite Brittany Murphy film.<br /><br />A few words of disclosure are necessary about this film. \\"Love and Other Disasters\\" is a romantic comedy set in London. There is not one original idea in the script and just about every movie cliche to be found in romantic comedies is in this movie to wit:<br />-- Murphy is a fashion designer with a mixed up love life.<br />-- She befriends a gay photographer (who is actually not gay) that loves her.<br />-- There are several other gay male characters in the film with mixed up love lives.<br />-- In fact, all the characters in the film have a mixed up love life.<br />-- All the actors are employed in the arts -- once writes a screeplay called \\"Love and Other Disasters.\\"<br />-- The film appears to be heading to tragedy but has a wonderful, happy ending.<br />-- The movie ends by having the action in the film made into a movie.<br /><br />Having made these disclosures, I will say I adore this movie. This is such a warm film, so full of good spirits and love, that it transcends all these cliches to be not only good entertainment but a memorable film experience. The chemistry between Jacks (Murphy) and Paolo (Santiago Cabrera) is natural, unforced and credible. Almost all the actors are likeable, you root for them, and you want their love to succeed. And it does.<br /><br />I can't think of a romantic comedy I've seen in recent years that I enjoy as much as this 2006 production. It's better than \\"Four Weddings And A Funeral\\" [[ASIN:B00000JRTX Four Weddings and a Funeral]] to which I think it compares very well. This is a sexy, delightful, easy on the eye and mind film that breezes through its 100 minutes and leaves you satisfied. If you're in the mood for mindless entertainment with a big warmth factor, this movie is for you.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I recently purchased these headphones with a gift card for Christmas, and the product was so poor I feel compelled to write a review. This headset has a few positive features: a decent USB microphone, comfortable ear cups, and chat audio is mixed on the fly with game audio. Now for the bad. First of all, merely powering up the headphones by plugging the USB cable into the PS3 produces hiss. It's obvious the inline amp is very poorly made. The hiss gets even worse when engaging the \\"stereo expander\\" feature. The audio quality is extremely poor. I have never heard headphones this bad, even a pair of cheap budget phones would sound better. I also own a pair of Grado SR-60s and Sennheiser PXC150 noise canceling headphones. I wanted to make sure I wasn't imagining the P21's bad audio quality so I used these for comparison. In short, I think a good pair of stereo headphones paired with a USB microphone would be a much better choice than anything being sold as a gaming headset. If there is such a thing as a quality gaming headset, the P21 surely is not it.

0307269981|1.0|This book is a slow plod, the hero is a mysogynist, the serial murder theme is nasty and tedious. I just don't get why it is so popular.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I really believe that most of the emotion in a movie comes from the soundtrack.  Avatar is the perfect case study for this.  What a diversity of music and emotions Horner gives us!  Some really light joyful music that just fills you up, and others dark and brooding that knocks you down.  The more I listen to it, the more I am amazed by it.  The thing about it that I think makes it so special, is the orchestration.  Just a really amazing variety of instruments and sounds.  Everything from traditional strings, brass and percussion, along with a lot very cool less common \\"ethnic\\" instruments that give it that \\"tribal\\" sound.  Wow, to me the soundtrack is every bit as special as the movie's tremendous visuals, and that's saying something!<br /><br />Update: as I've now been listening to this sountrack for a couple of months, my appreciation for it has grown by leaps and bounds.  I'm just completely blown away by what James Horner has accomplished here.  The variety and intricacy of the sounds is just dumbfounding, and there are passages that consistently bring tears to my eyes when I listen to it.  What's really funny is listening to a sound track like this, then going to see pretty much any other movie that is on the big screen right now.  Owch.  Is there anyway that I can give this 6 stars? hehe.
B002PAQETY|5.0|I have all the stereophonics albums. I honestly think that this album is superior. In my opinion with this one the band have arrived. There is not one track which isn't good. '100mph' is in the 'Maybe tomorrow' mould, 'Innocent' is a fantastic single. What about 'Uppercut'? and...... well all the album>  Get this one, and all the other albums. Stereophonics are the most underrated band ever.

6305428042|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Bette Midler works overtime trying to infuse this featherlight kids movie with some desperately-needed energy, but the sloppy editing, weak child acting, uninteresting storyline and lukewarm direction by choreographer and schlock-merchant Kenny Ortega make this a film to skip.    2/4
B000E1JOSE|5.0|I listen to this over and over and wonder how Orbison could have created and sung such great songs.  He may have looked like a Nerd, but he was true genius.

0670021652|2.0|Being stuck on a 12-hour flight from New Zealand to Los Angeles was the only reason I was able to finish Gilberts' disappointing memoir.  As one of her intimate readers and a fan of all of her novels I was pleased to see her newest release for sale in the Auckland airport.  I happily settled into my flight secure in the knowledge that the hours would fly by as I hungrily devoured the continuing saga of Liz and Felipe.  Chapter after chapter I hung on, sure that her old EPL style would return.  I got bored with the history of marriage.  I became impatient with her whining and didn't believe the story that she loved Felipe TOO much to marry him.  When she revealed more than halfway through the book that she and Felipe actually wore rings when they were not married I was done with them. She claimed that the rings were representative of the secret promise of committment they had made to each other.  How hypocritical of Liz and Felipe!  Their willingness to adopt this tradition while dismissing legal marriage felt like a betrayal to me.  Having lived with my partner for many years without the benefits of marriage AND putting up with the messiness of different names and bare ring fingers, I resent Liz and Felipe for caving into convenience and masquarading as a married couple.  Maybe I wouldn't have felt so suckered if the couple had tattooed rings on their fingers - that is very brave, but to sneakily slip that fact into the last quarter of the book shows her true colors.  I did finish the book, but I have cancelled my membership in her fan club.  The $45 NZ dollars would have been better spent on souvenirs.
B002QGUFWE|4.0|The good songs are so good! I can't get the tunes out of my head. Her voice is so good to listen. But the rest are mostly fillers. The rest are short and they keep looping the same beats. Somehow the songs from the music video from TV sound much better than the ones in the CD. The CD insert from the CD is very nice too.
B001FOPODS|4.0|Peter and the Wolf is a wonderfully dark retelling of the classic Sergei Prokofiev children's story/musical composition. Technically brilliant, fluidly animated, and lavishly detailed, it is among the finest examples of stop-motion animation. It's great for adults, but parents may want to screen it first before showing their kids, as there are some potentially scary imagery and realistic violence.<br /><br />For example, right at the beginning, Peter goes to town and gets scared by a stuffed wolf in a shop window. He accidentally bumps into a hunter, who bullies him, and throws him in a dumpster. He then points his rifle at Peter. Later in the story, one of Peter's animal friends gets eaten. Lastly, Peter has the unblinking eyes, icy stare, and dour expressionless face of a plastic doll that younger kids may also find disturbing (see DVD cover). The harsh realities of rural Russian life are depicted here. It's certainly different than the [[ASIN:6302961696 Disney]] version that you may remember.<br /><br />There is no dialogue or narration. Everything is told through images, music, and silence, and I thought perhaps the musical backbone of the original story took a back seat to the animation. In various versions I've seen, each character is represented by a strong and distinct musical instrument. Here, the soundtrack did not seem to give each character a unique voice. The music just seems to be part of the background rather than who the characters are.<br /><br />Overall, still very good and definitely worth watching.
B002T9H2ME|4.0|Moon is something of an oddity to be sure.  In the realm of the science fiction film genre, many films usually occupy the sub-genre of alien invasions/contacts, interstellar travel, etc.  Now and then however, a few films will pop up in the genre that akin more to the kind of hard science fiction that 2001: A Space Odyssey pioneered years ago; films like The Fountain or Steven Soderbergh's remake of Solaris.  Moon falls into that category of hard science fiction, marking the feature film debut of director Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie.  Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, an astronaut on the way of coming to an end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon.  His only company is the robotic GERTY 3000 (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and needless to say, he's looking forward to reuniting with his wife and young daughter.  Things take a strange turn however when Sam starts seeing and hearing strange occurances, and then things really take a turn after he recovers from an accident and discovers that he isn't quite as alone as he thought he was, and things are definitely not what they seem.  I really don't want to give anything away here, but when things twist and turn with Moon, they manage to truly surprise the viewer.  The film presents some thought provoking moments, and while things don't always work out as well as they probably should (the film is quite slow moving), the end result is that Moon is a haunting, and surprisingly touching at times, science fiction film.  Rockwell is superb, and truly one of the most underrated actors working today.  Hopefully after Moon, and with his upcoming role in the high profile Iron Man II, he'll finally get the right kind of recognition that he wholeheartedly deserves.  All in all, give Moon a chance at the very least, regardless of what sorts of science ficiton films are your cup of tea.  You'll be pleasently surprised, as Moon is indeed a future cult classic.
B000EJ9MTW|4.0|It's virtually impossible to write a review for a Wolfmother album without referring to the heavy music scene of the 1969 to 1976 period, unless you have never heard anything from that time period and Wolfmother is your first introduction to the roots of hard rock/heavy metal.    I heard 'Cosmic Egg' first and two weeks later bought the debut album. After the first few songs I found myself repeating names like Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Uriah Heep, the Doors, Deep Purple, Blue Cheer, Warhorse, Free, Trapeze, and of course, the White Stripes (not really old in comparison but of similar sound to Wolfmother). I also felt there was some similarity with the early albums of the Tea Party, a band that often toured in Australia.    The first track, 'Dimension' sounds like Blue Cheer borrowing Grand Funk Railroad's guitar equipment and putting a younger Jack White on vocals. I find it amazing that after all the evolution the distortion pedal has gone through, a band of modern times would try to emulate the sound of those purple hazy, crazy days of '68 and '69. Amazing and enjoyable.    From there on, the good times rock and roll on like a maverick locomotive about to plough off the tracks. We get a taste of gentler music when the sound switches to Zeppelin-esque styles or acoustic guitar intros reminiscent of early Trapeze or other hard rock bands of the early seventies. There are keyboard effects that will make you think of the Doors; power chord riffs and bass lines that will have you shouting, 'Black Sabbath, man!'; organ solos coupled with heavy guitar that will have you searching through your Uriah Heep albums; and a vocal style that will make you think Jack White has gone south (and down under) for the winter.    Yet in spite of all the old style music dished up for a modern day audience (and for guys like me who lament modern music's static and stagnant stage of evolution), Wolfmother come off all rock and roll in all sincerity, no apologies or cover-ups (or coversfor that matter). It's like three guys decided that there's no reason why one of the most creative eras of rock music has to be dead and embalmed and that they could breathe life back into the classic sound of early heavy metal and hard rock.    I give it a high four stars only because, honestly, I find the similarity between the White Stripes a little too strong at times, even though I like the Stripes. Wolfmother are very good at combining their influences into fresh material, and I think it would be good for them to assert their modern day originality more strongly. But that is true for the second album. :)
B000UJ48VI|4.0|Lolita (Stanley Kubrick, 1962)<br /><br />[note: I swear I originally reviewed Lolita back in 1989, and did so again early in the last decade. However, I cannot find a trace of either review anywhere. And thus I review it for a third time. Apologies if all this sounds familiar. That's because it probably is.<br /><br />I was never a Kubrick fan in my younger days. Granted, when you're a teenager, your critical skills are somewhat impaired, but I always thought Full Metal Jacket, after its wonderful first forty-five minutes, wandered off into utter pointlessness, Dr. Strangelove was weirdly absent of humor for such a revered movie, and 2001 was... well, then. In any case, all that lasted until the first time I saw Lolita back in the late eighties (on a double bill with FMJ). There's a scene about halfway through the film where Humbert (James Mason) and Quilty (Peter Sellers) meet for the first time in a bar. Looking back on it from a post-1995 standpoint, I'm surprised it didn't generate all the excitement of Pacino and DeNiro meeting for the first time in Heat. As for the actual execution, Kubrick's scene blows Mann's right out of the water; Mason, who otherwise overacts through most of the film, is the picture of a guilty conscience, while Sellers is an incredible combination of slapstick and menace. Lolita quickly became my favorite Kubrick film, and remained such for almost twenty years (it was recently surpassed by Paths of Glory). That said, as an adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's novel, it must be considered an utter failure; part of the mass of idiosyncrasy that was Stanley Kubrick is that his ability to faithfully adapt pretty much anything was subsumed in his consciousness by his desire to make the source material fit into his views both of what filmmaking should be and what social statement he was attempting to make with the movie. (And as a result, according to IMDB, while Nabokov liked the finished film, he wondered why he'd spent the time adapting his novel, since so little of his screenplay was actually used.) There are movies, however, that demand to be looked at as separate works than those that inspired them. Consider the case of Tobe Hooper's adaptations of Robert Bloch's Psycho (which became The Texas Chain Saw Massacre) and Stephen King's 'Salem's Lot. As adaptations, they just plain suck, but as free-standing films, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre has become one of the most respected horror movies of all time, and 'Salem's Lot is a monstrously entertaining exercise in cheese. Such it is with Lolita, a bad adaptation but an excellent film.<br /><br />For those who don't know the plot (how could you not? but I digress), European professor Humbert Humbert, recently divorced, heads off to America to take a teaching position at a small liberal arts college in Ohio. Beforehand, he spends the summer in a resort town in New Hampshire. While looking for lodgings, he meets the irrepressible Charlotte Haze (Shelley Winters) and her stepdaughter Lolita (Sue Lyon). Humbert instantly falls for the nymphet and takes a room at the Haze's place; soon, he will go as far as marrying the mother in order to stay close to the daughter. The film really begins, however, when Charlotte finds out about Humbert's obsession with Lolita and confronts him, never realizing that the other guy she pursued after her husband's death, Claire Quilty (Sellers), is also obsessed with her darling daughter...<br /><br />While elements of black humor had pervaded Kubrick's films before (The Killing is a masterpiece of subtle black comedy, as many of the best noir films are), Lolita was his first attempt at making an out-and-out comedy, and in that regard, it works very well. That's another of the big differences between novel and movie; Nabokov was much more subtle in his humor than Kubrick, who widened and whitened it a great deal here (viz. the cot scene, which could have come out of a Laurel and Hardy flick, or Sellers' penchant for silly accents).Humbert Humbert comes off far less a slave to his obsessions than he does a guy who's feeling put upon by society's silly rules, but once again, if you don't look at it as an adaptation, that's not necessarily a bad thing (and those who would jump to castigate Kubrick for considering the rules Humbert's chafing at \\"silly\\" might do well to remember Kubrick addressed the same basic theme in Paths of Glory, with much the same outcome; it brings Kubrick's satire of Humbert's outlook into much sharper focus). Mason does tend to overact his part; no one with eyes and ears could fail to notice Humbert's guilty conscience, though pretty much everyone else in the movie, save one nosy neighbor (and Quilty, in the spirit of like-knows-like), does exactly that. Sellers, too, is guilty of a great deal of overacting here as well, but (a) everyone expected that anyway, and (b) in his case, it was all for comic relief.<br /><br />The real surprise here is Sue Lyon, at the beginning of a very brief film career (in which she often played this sort of temptress, viz. Night of the Iguana or Autopsy, romancing Richard Burton and Fernando Rey respectively). During the first half of the film, Lolita herself is an almost unseen character save that first glimpse Humbert gets of her; it's only in the second half of the film that Lolita becomes a character in her own right, and that was exactly the right choice of Kubrick to make in this situation. Humbert seems almost as shocked as the audience that Lolita isn't a cardboard cutout (or, maybe more to the point, a blow-up doll), and it's that transformation that gives much of the second half of the movie the power it has. I grant you, once she does become a three-dimensional character, Lolita heads straight into typical-teenager territory (at least, typical teenager territory for the early sixties), but still.<br /><br />There will be people who just can't get past the subject matter, despite the fact that Kubrick really soft-pedals it (Lolita's age is raised three years and only the barest hints are dropped about intimate activity); if you are one of those people, then you should avoid this. For everyone else it's a must-see. ****ess a slave to his obsessions than he does a guy who's feeling put upon by society's silly rules, but once again, if you don't look at it as an adaptation, that's not necessarily a bad thing (and those who would jump to castigate Kubrick for considering the rules Humbert's chafing at \\"silly\\" might do well to remember Kubrick addressed the same basic theme in Paths of Glory, with much the same outcome; it brings Kubrick's satire of Humbert's outlook into much sharper focus).

B002P6TA94|4.0|My friend came up to me one morning and asked me if I knew about Wolfmother. No, I did not? What? I hadn't heard about Woldmother? Apparently, until the night before, he hadn't either. So he let me listen to a few snippets of tunes on his i-Pod. Yup. Sounds good. Sure. Another hard rock band I should be into, eh? Uh-huh.    Then I heard the guitar riff for 'Sundial'. What the heck was that? That's cool. So, I ordered the delux-edition of the album, hoping for lots of Sundial riffs. What I got wasn't disappointing at all.    I gave CD 1 a spin in my car while driving and when it was done it spun a second time before CD 2 went in for a double run through. The album ended up on my MD player as well and stayed in it for two weeks before the debut album took over. What can I say? I love the music.    Only a couple of months ago I was thinking that music these days has stagnated. Once there was a time when you could date a song to the year just by the sound and style. Now 2009 sounds almost like 1999. I gave up hope and spent most of my time in my 1968 to 1978 music collection. Wolfmother not only revive that sound and style of composing and playing but give it a shot to wake up the dead rock stars of the classic days of hard rock and metal.    What I particularly like about this second album is the appearance of some mother heavy riffs that would leave Tony Iommi wondering why he hadn't thought of them. The riff and sound is so heavy sometimes it seems even the distortion is weighed down and sluggish, and an image of a glacier bulldozing it's way into downtown comes to mind.    But it's not all about knocking you senseless on your ass with heavy riffs. There's plenty of straight out hard rock and ease back acoustic and piano in the very best of the classic sense. For a band whose front man talks about a rock show that's just \\"bang, bang, bang, bang,\\" one song after another (see their web site for the interview with Andrew Stockdale), they put a lot of effort into creativity and mood. The album is a rich menu of flavours.    One other thing I appreciate on this album is that there is less of a Jack White vocal style (though still prominent in some songs). At times I find myself thinking that Stockdale's vocals resemble a young Ozzy in tone but with power coming closer to (but not equivalent to) a young Robert Plant.    Overall, this album is a high four stars for me. And that's because I am being very critical in my opinion.
B000UL61D4|3.0|Diabel (Andrzej Zulawski, 1972)<br /><br />After being completely wowed by Possession, Zulawski's 1981 drama about the disintegration of the world's most dysfunctional family, I started hunting down other Zulawski works. Thus I came upon Diabel, a 1972 historical drama that has far more in common with Makavejev than it does with Eisenstein, an absurdist fantasia informed by cheapo sixties gore films and contemporary Soviet politics as much as Prussia's 1793 invasion of Poland (which would have been interchangeable with any other; as Gunter Grass has often said, Poland is the world's most-invaded nation. I'm guessing Zulawski had eighteenth-century costumes and went from there.)<br /><br />The plot involves Jakub (Leszek Teleszynski, who started as a Zulawski regular), who as the film opens is a political prisoner. Just before the place he's being held is overrun by invading Prussians, he's sprung from captivity by a mysterious savior, who takes him (and a young nun who flees with them) back to his family estate in the country, where he is reunited with his sister and meets her decidedly odd fiance. Jakub was being kept prisoner because the Prussians believe he has valuable information about revolutionary conspirators (they believe, in fact, he is one); Jakub continually protests his innocence on this front, but like Kafka's Joseph K, you get the feeling there's more to the story than he's telling. For roughly the first two-thirds of the film, Jakub, in the company of his savior and his sister's beau, witnesses the effects of the complete breakdown of civilization the Prussian invasion has brought about. Once he's finally had enough of that to drive him insane, he, too, embraces a reversion to his animal nature, though as a few reviewers have noted, throughout the film Jakub is the sanest person we meet, with the possible exception of the hot young nun (played by Zulawski's then-girlfriend Malgorzata Braunek). The ending of the film is sadly predictable, though maybe I'm jaded and you won't see it coming at all.<br /><br />Zulawski, in his early thirties when this movie was completed, definitely adopts an angry-young-man approach to his material here, using it as an excoriation of Soviet policy (as he did many of the films he made in Eastern Europe) as well as an exercise in pushing the envelope. Like most of Zulawski's Polish films, this one was banned in Poland for many years, surfacing only in the late eighties, because of its implicit criticism of Soviet policy (the Prussian invaders and the KGB look awfully similar) and its seemingly gratuitous violence and perversion. It's a movie that's designed to provoke, and in that sense, it doesn't work as well as Makavejev's WR, which came out the year before, but then it's also a piece with a vastly different tone to it. Makavejev was after farce, airing his criticisms through the parallel of sexual politics and humor. Zulawski wanted to open the system up and take a look at the guts through eye-gouging, incest, and shooting people in the face. Same result, but very different approaches.<br /><br />Ultimately, I don't think it works as well here, though when you contrast it to later films that adopted the same approach (most notably T. F. Mous' Men Behind the Sun), Zulawski's movie, while less coherent than many of its stripe, is still riveting. As with most groundbreaking seventies films from the Polish underground, you have to be prepared for its low-budget amateur status; those who have only been exposed to Zulawski through Possession (the only of his films to have an American DVD release to this day) may find themselves surprised at how much this looks like film school work. But then, so does WR, and no one denies that movie's classic status. Worth seeing for fans of political films that are actually good, as few of them as there are, and a must-see for gorehounds. ** ½ou won't see it coming at all.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Tim Burton, 2007)<br /><br />Perhaps my problem with Tim Burton's much-praised adaptation of Sweeney Todd is that I'm seeing it too soon after Dave Moore's version, which was the sublime side of the sublime/ridiculous coin. It's not that this version is bad, in any way, it's just not all that good compared to a number of Burton's other masterworks.<br /><br />Burton regulars Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham-Carter take on the roles of Sweeney Todd and his neighbor Mrs. Lovett, a destitute pie-seller. Todd, a barber by trade, is bent on getting revenge against Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), who sent him to prison in order to steal his lovely young wife. Todd starts taking out those standing in his way, and needs something to do with the bodies. Lovett hatches a plan--grind 'em up and sell 'em as Mrs. Lovett's meat pies. They, of course, sell like the proverbial hotcakes. Tension arises when Lovett starts having feelings for Todd, who is so obsessed with his revenge and his lost love that he has eyes for nothing else...<br /><br />Burton brings the same phantasmagoric, hallucinatory visuals to Sweeney Todd that he did to his previous remake, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and when it comes right down to it, I wasn't all that fond of them in that movie, either (which I just looked up; I gave it two and a half stars back in 2006). The over-the-top Burton vision works just fine for me when he's doing original material (viz. Edward Scissorhands or Beetlejuice), but when it comes to Burton adaptations, I always preferred the much lower-key look of Sleepy Hollow (or, while it's not a remake, the similar feel of his best film, Ed Wood). I'm also not as fond of the Sondheim adaptation, which Burton follows rather faithfully here, as of some other incarnations of Sweeney Todd. It really comes down to whether you want your murder and cannibalism with lighthearted whimsy, as presented here, or whether you want it in a dark, claustrophobic presentation without musical numbers, which you get from Moore's 2006 adaptation. ** ½out musical numbers, which you get from Moore's 2006 adaptation. ** ½

B0026P3G12|3.0|I wanted to love the CD as much as I loved watching Susan Boyle's audition clip on You Tube. But I just couldn't get into it. I listened to it in the car, at home, at work; I was trying to convince myself that I liked Boyle. And then I realized, what I loved most--was her story.     When I played the CD's version of her signature song, \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" I wasn't moved in the same way. It sounded very polished. I preferred the original, raw and powerful performance that brought an audience of haters to its feet, cheering for Boyle. I wanted to relive the moment when an extraordinarily plain Jane gal raised eyebrows and shut up all those who laughed out loud and thought:    \\"Who does this middle-aged loser think she is? What talent could this lady possibly have with those looks and that body and those clothes?\\" I could relate to Boyle. I think a lot of people could relate to being pre-judged based on their appearance.    Why you may like this CD:     * Boyle does have talent. She sings clearly and the music doesn't overpower her voice; she is the star.     * There is an eclectic mix of music--from the traditional \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"Silent Night\\" to Madonna's \\"You'll See\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" by the Rolling Stones. Although, to me, the songs started to blend together.     * Her rendition of The Monkees' \\"Daydream Believer\\" isn't peppy pop; it's wistful, which made me take notice of a song I never cared for before.     * She has jotted down personal comments about her songs in the liner notes. For \\"Who I  Was Born To Be,\\" she wrote (with two \\"buts\\"), \\"Ambition, fate, call it what you will, but but who was I born to be? Mum must have picked this for me.\\"     * There's a lovely picture of Boyle and her mum, although this Susan looks quite different from the one featured on the back of the CD, sitting next to a piano in a dark, ruffled gown.    So, in the end, why 3 stars? I asked myself, \\"Would I buy this again?\\" and the answer was no. I'm happier with the You Tube clip.
B00125WAWS|5.0|Great movie!    The only thing I would do is to take out all the things Oprah Winfrey has to say in the DVD extras.  What is ti with that gal?  Ok, so you're a trillionaire, Oprah, no doubt as executive producer Denzel bamboozled a lot of dough out of you, BUT HAVEN'T WE HEARD ENOUGH ALREADY FROM YOU?  Just keep giving away automobiles and shut up, k?    As for the movie, all the new young actors were superb.  I hesitated watching this movie because I thought: how can anyone make a movie about *debating* interesting?    Finally, I realized -- hey, wait a second, Denzel, Denzel Washington.  God!  Everything he does is good and right, pure and omniscent.      Denzel Washington, upon whom the Celluloid World rises and sets.  Denzel Washington, who can leap buildings in a single bound.  (And I mean that.  With an unbelievable amount of sincerity.)    And he didn't fail.  As both actor and director, he did an excellent job.  He's worth all the million of dollars he gets.  More so than ... even me.      I can't say that his acting in this movie was as good as the movie overall, which was excellent, but I'm giving the movie five stars and if the estate of Carl Sagan doesn't like it they can kiss me in the Astor Bar.    One other thing that I found rather amusing.  Towards the end of the movie the Wiley College students go to Boston to debate the Harvard team.  There they are told that the topic for debate is \\"Resolved: Capitalism is Immoral.\\"  Then, at the last minute, they're told that due to a technicality (their teacher wasn't supposed to help them with their research) that the debate topic will be changed to \\"Resolved: Civil Disobedience Can Be a Moral Weapon in the Fight For Justice.\\"     lol      In the words of that great American philosopher Dana \\"The Church Lady\\" Carvey: \\"How conveeeeeenient!\\" ... I mean, wouldn't you love to see a movie that Oprah Winfrey produced wherein there's a debate about the morality of capitalism. ... Oprah the Filthy Rich Billionaire.And then of course guess what?  Guess who takes the affirmative of the *new* debate topic, \\"Resolved: Civil Disobedience Can Be a Moral Weapon in the Fight For Justice.\\"      I wonder why they even suggested debating the morality of capitalism.  Perhaps Oprah decided to become a socialist, and Denzel talked her out of it at the last minute.  To paraphrase Willie Loman's next door neightbor, Charlie: \\"Are you a socialist, Oprah; or still working?\\")     But why indicate that Wiley was originally going to debate the morality of capitalism?  It seems to me that the filmmakers want it both ways.  They realize that during the Depression there were indeed a great many people who considered capitalism to be not just immoral but brutal, destructive and anathema to the human condition.  So they pay lipservice to that historical sentiment but, political cowards that they are, they quickly retreat to a premise -- civil disobedience in the face of unjust laws is permissible -- that's impossible to disagree with, let alone lose to in a debate.      In short, Oprah is going to KEEP THE BILLIONS!!!      She may wave to a socialist or two from her limousine.  But don't count on it.   After all, truth, morality and justice may be sacred ... but profit is divine.      Right, Oprah?
B000002UB2|4.0|I love The Beatles, and Abbey Road is the favourite album of all time for me. But this is to let all prospective buyers of this vinyl know that it's the 1987 remasters being used for the pressing not the original 1969 master or the 2009 remaster.    REPEAT: THIS VINYL IS A PRESSING OF THE 1987 REMASTER.    The 1987 remasters were lambasted for fuzzy bass and tinny vocals and the vinyl really shows this. Why they didn't use the '69 master I'll never know.
B002T9H2L0|3.0|I'm a fan of Tarantino, but this film put me to sleep.  It's 75% talking and 85% of that is subtitles!!! A slow Tarantino film (known for his long scenes of dialogue) that you have to read... it was rough.  It has it's moments, but they were too few, and Brad Pitt was more of an extraneous character (which might have been intentional since his accent was a bit silly.  Not a bad movie, I just wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|At least 3 times a week since it was released on September 12, 2008. A few hits and misses since 1991, but a solid, catchy, rock AND thrash album. Every week I have a different favorite song.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|I bought this movie cause I heard so many great things about it.  But I couldn't watch more than half of it.  I don't mind the subtitles.  I've lived in enough foreign countries to be used to that.  But good lord, how do you make a movie about killing Nazi's so boering?  Quentin Tarantino found a way.  It drags from one scene to another with so much talking.  The acting was great.  The scenes were done beautifuly.  But a movie that bills itself as an action movie had me asleep half way through it.  And Brad pitt, who normally I like has a terribly unbeleivable southern accent, which kinda put his acting skills in question for me.
1423117166|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo9BKI6KQEKH5D]]John Lasseter mentions in the introduction his first job in college was pulling animation sequences from \\"the morgue\\" - Disney's archive of animation artworks. Well, this book is filled with those animation boards from \\"the morgue\\". Specifically, these are boards before the clean up process -- before sketchy pencil lines are removed and colours, backgrounds added.<br /><br />The second book in The Archive Series is still a huge thick hardcover with the boards printed gloriously big. Compared to the first volume, every artist is now properly credited to their work. There are a couple of fold-outs which are unnecessary because the art isn't printed across the fold anyway.<br /><br />This book is primarily on the character art and animation. Artists and animators who want to give their characters life, make them act or emote, will gain a lot from this book. This is more so than the first book because here it features a lot of expressions. There's no mistaking how the characters feel or what they are doing just by looking at their expressions and poses.<br /><br />For animation sequences, well, the boards included are actually a mixture of in-sequence and standalone. You'll probably be able to recognise the many memorable scenes, like how Dumbo swings from her mother's trunk (sweet!), when Pinnochio takes his first step or the spaghetti-eating-to-kissing scene (classic!) in The Lady and the Tramp.<br /><br />Plenty of legendary artists are included, like Ub Iwerks, Norm Ferguson, Ben Sharpsteen, Hamilton Luske, Dick Huemer, Grim Natwick, Art Babbitt, Fred Moore, Bill Tytla, Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston, Milt Kahl, Marc Davis, John Lounsbery, Ward Kimball, Eric Larson, Les Clark, Wolfgang Reitherman, John Sibley, Bill Justice, Clyde Geronimi, Ted Berman, Glen Keane, Andreas Deja, Eric Goldberg, Mark Henn and Tony Bancroft.<br /><br />This is an inspiring book highly recommended to animators.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

0385504225|2.0|I found this book enjoyable, interesting, and somehow not boring. So why the 2 stars? When I think about it, I realize that this book does not have very much plot. It can be summarized very easily, and not much is really going on. Most of the novel is explaining history, science, symbols, etc or getting backstory on characters. I am also not a fan of inserting the villan's point of view when it serves no purpose. Nothing is gained from having the bad guy chime in about how he ties his loincloth. We also have to read the same event different times from different viewpoints. The review on the front page is absolutely correct. Something is explained, Robert opposes it saying it is only a myth, something is shown to Robert, and there is shock. Then, which really irritates me, the book cuts to a small paragraph where a CIA agent is looking at a phone or some other unimportant nonsense. I get that this is supposed to make is suspenseful, but it really just feels like a cut to commercial. Another big no-no for me was the obvious twist towards the end. Authors add these twists to shock us, make us go \\"wow\\", or shake our heads. Unfortunately, I saw this one coming the entire time, and I think I'm not alone in that sentiment.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol could have been a 3 star with a little editing and a little less from the villan. If we didn't get to read about the villan so much, maybe the twist would have been more of a surprise. I also think that Robert was a bit unlikable in this installment. He is supposed to be open minded, yet he completely shuts down any line of thinking that is contrary to what he was taught. Not only is it out of character, but it is irritating. Every time a new idea is presented he says \\"no, that's only a myth.\\" Give it a chance Langdon, people are in danger!
0439023491|1.0|I'll be up front - I gave Hunger Games 5 stars based on its strengths in a specific genre which is ya scifi- great plotting, descriptions, subtext, etc. I was eager to pick up Catching Fire. When I did, I couldn't get beyond chapter 2 and returned it (not to Amazon).<br /><br />Everything that I liked about the Hunger Games was completely destroyed in the first 2 chapters and I figured it wouldn't get much better. In reading the other reviews of 1 and 2 stars, I see some people agree with me.<br /><br />My concerns:<br />1. story isn't told in the voice of a 16 year old. I had this issue with Hunger Games, but the plotting was strong enough to make me overlook it. But in Catching Fire, a lot is told in flashbacks, and the adult like voice of the narrator becomes more noticeable. We should see and not be told - why we don't see her reunion with Gale is a huge missed opportunity.<br /><br />2. Repetitive - others have mentioned this in their reviews as well. I understand that the author needs to bring first time readers up to speed - but it wasn't very well done. To those who read HG, it was another device that took you out of the story. I have read other reviews here and now know that Kat returned to the Hunger Games arena, and that too just felt lazy.<br /><br />3. Plotting - (spoiler) the President makes an appearance at Kat's house in the 2nd chapter and has a very frank discussion with her, and she with him. This was just ridiculous. There was no subtext. Again, it just felt lazy.<br /><br />with all due respect to the author, who wrote a wonderful first book in this trilogy - when one book is so stellar, the second one is held to a very high standard. Perhaps as a stand alone book Catching Fire would be fine. But I agree with other reviewers that the 2nd act is always the most difficult to pull off and I would suspect that the 3rd book will be much better and I do look forward to reading it, though I may skim it in the bookstore before I actually commit to buying it this time.g it this time.

B000KJT8IG|1.0|Every year our family watches an old VCR tape of this movie for Christmas.  So decided that this year I'd update it with a new DVD.  Unfortunately, the sound was out of sinc with the movement of the lips.  Kind of like one of the old Saturday Night Live skits they did about the old Roman warrior movies.   Amazon made good and sent a new one.  Unfortunately, this new one did the same thing.  When I talked to a representative from Amazon they said they would pull the stock from the shelves and review the other ones to see whether they had gotten a bad batch.  Their advice was to wait a couple of weeks before trying again.  I'm thinking I'll get it somewhere else.
0670021652|3.0|I adored Eat, Pray, Love and was very excited to read Committed. Elizabeth Gilbert is an incredibly talented writer. A lot of people say, \\"It's nothing like Eat, Pray, Love.\\" I don't think that is fair because why should it be? This is a different book. This book is really a history lesson on marriage, which I did find very interesting, however, I think that she does go on too long with the facts and history. I would have liked to read more about her personal adventures with Felipe. I bought the book in hardback (otherwise I would have waited for paperback) because I am going to her talk/signing and that was the price of the ticket. I am really looking forward to seeing her in person.
B002SJIO5E|3.0|3 of 5 stars for the sci-fi movie District 9. Believe it or not, I really had not seen any trailers nor clips from this movie. I was excited to see it just because it seemed like another Independance Day. So, I had no idea what to expect when it started. To summarize first, I was disappointed but still liked it enough to give 3 stars. The short version is a group of aliens come to the Earth and their mother ship gets stuck hanging above South Africa. This event happened many years ago and the aliens are now living in slum-like conditions in a prison camp. The style of this movie is to look like a news program or a documentary. Alot shot on video rather than film gives a crisp look. It seemed like a low budget film until you realize the high quality seamless special effects. So, I was not all that impressed with this movie and will give it a mildly positive recommendation. The blu-ray has some good behind the scenes materials that are helpful in understanding why the movie is as it is.
0395389496|5.0|My son LOVES the Polar Express.  He took a ride on the Polar Express last year, seen the movie 100+ times and has even gone to Polar Express parties.  The book was awesome.  We cuddled up on the couch and read the book as if it was his first time hearing the story.  He loved it.
B002UJIY70|3.0|3 of 5 stars for the movie thriller A Perfect Getaway. We meet three couples who are on vacations in Hawaii. We soon learn that a tourist couple was murdered elsewhere in Hawaii and the suspects are a young man and woman. Hummm .... Sounds like a good setup for a thriller. Several plot twists and tangents to keep you guessing. Of course we end up alone in the middle of nowhere on an island. Enough said. The plot is actually very simple and predictable. The value in the movie is in the acting and character development which casts doubt on each of the three couples. The scenery is amazing. Well photographed, good pace and some real surprises. Milla Jovovich (a favorite of mine) had a relatively minor role and didn't stand-out.<br /><br />This movie will keep you guessing and keep you at the edge of your seat. Why only 3 stars? Well, it is a thriller, but, I have seen many movies with similar plots and this one never really got you truly scared or fully engaged. So, its good not great.
0920668364|3.0|Love You Forever is a short book written by Robert Munsch and was published nearly 25 years ago. In December of 2001 it ranked fourth on Publishers Weekly All-Time Bestselling Children's Books (paperbacks). The story begins with a mother gently rocking her baby son singing \\"I'll love you forever, I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\". We see the boy grow up until he becomes an adult, and over the years, the mother continues to sing the song to her son as she rocks him during his sleep. When the mother becomes elderly, the roles reverse, and her son rocks his mother while singing the same song. At the end of the story, the boy is now a father, and he rocks his daughter as she sleeps while singing I'll Love You Forever.<br /><br />Although my wife finds this story touching, I found it odd when the mother puts a huge ladder on top of her car and drives across town to her son's home. She climbs into the window of son's bedroom, puts her adult son in her lap and rocks him as she sings I'll Love You Forever. I have read that this story makes many cry and is probably more popular with mothers. Those who criticize this book feel it is too deep for little children. Many do not like how the mother is old and sick at the end of the book and needs to be taken care of by her son. I have absolutely no problem reading this book to my girls (ages four and seven), but I don't plan to unless my girls make that request. I can see why so many like it, but I thought it was just okay.
1597801577|5.0|When the rest of the world drowned in carbon and rising seas, Thailand stood strong, held off the tide, and kept producing its own crops.  But genetically customized diseases threaten to overwhelm this last bastion of purity.  American companies jockey for position, nativist troops fight to keep the round-eyes out, and one desperate, scared, abandoned woman, grown in a vat as a toy for rich men, struggles to stay alive in the face of world-smashing hostility.<br /><br />Paolo Bacigalupi's award-winning short fiction has shown ways in which humanity risks destroying this world by our own unfettered greed.  His debut novel goes even further in depth, providing a grim and frightening glimpse of post-apocalyptic world-building.  As one group, blind to the lessons of the past, tries to recapture what they think of as lost glory, another stands for control, fighting against the coming of a bleak post-human world.<br /><br />Many polemic writers find it easy to lapse into white hats versus black hats.  No such trap here.  Bacigalupi's characters are so fully defined that, in reading, I found my loyalties sliding back and forth.  The guy I hated a moment ago suddenly becomes the hero of the next chapter; the virtuous victim goes on a rampage and suddenly I'm hoping she gets her own.  This is a complex novel that does not permit the audience to cling to easy answers or snap judgments.<br /><br />The technology is also eye-opening.  One moment, it seems Bacigalupi has his eyes on the future (this year's genetically optimized crops fight last year's genetically optimized blights), and in the next, he looks over his shoulder at the past (treadle-driven appliances and clockwork springs).  This is a possible future very different from any I recall reading recently, and it's so minutely realized that it's easy to think we may actually be headed in just this direction.<br /><br />This is high-tension fiction in a complex and plausible scientific future.  It's a dire warning of what we may face if we don't mend our ways and start looking after our earth.  And it's a gripping story of politics, high-stakes finance, and science struggling for dominance in a world that has been transformed beyond repair.  I've been looking for well-written hard science fiction for a long time.  Here I've finally found it.r ways and start looking after our earth.

B000JK8OYU|3.0|This album offers nothing new to the Beatles canon: no new songs, no new insight into the old songs, not even a new CD I want to listen to very often.  Original Beatles producer George Martin takes the individual bits of music that the Fab Four first recorded on four-track machines back in the 1960s, mixes them together, and tries to shine a new light on the old classics.  Instead, he provides a stuttering novelty that gets tired early.<br /><br />By back-tracking the original masters, slipping in key changes and staggered time signatures, and juxtaposing instruments from one track with vocals from another, the new product creates new sounds from the old songs.  Some of these can be interesting, such as the multiple occasions when the percussion from one song sounds syncopated overtop another song.  But usually, the product sounds merely cute and easily forgettable.<br /><br />In many ways, the test of the success of a recording is how often you want to listen to it.  I could listen to my original Beatles albums over and over, and I have done so for years, to the point that I have worn the finish off the CDs.  This I listened to a couple of times, and haven't been able to go back to since.  It just doesn't touch my soul the way the originals still do.

B00006LIRI|5.0|This is a nice compilation of U2 music from that decade, and it includes several remixes that improve many of the songs. So, song by song, here it goes...    Even Better Than The Real Thing & Mysterious Ways - Great way to start an album. Two uptempo hits most fans would know. Interestingly, Mysterious Ways has a single alternate lyric compared to the Achtung Baby hit version.    Beautiful Day - The song that gave U2 new life after the train wreck that was Pop & the Popmart Tour. And it was released in 2000, so it qualifies.    Electrical Storm (William Orbit Mix) - The first new song, and a very good one at that.    One - What can you say about this one? One of the greatest songs ever.    Miss Sarajevo - Bono's favorite song, and rightfully so, as it is one of the best they ever recorded.    Stay (Far Away, So Close!) - Another great one, a hit from Zooropa. Some of Bono's best vocals.    Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of - The only other single from All That You Can't Leave Behind that qualified for this collection. Good thing, because it fits right in.    Gone (New Mix) - Possibly the surprise of the album! A new mix of the song is presented, with clearer vocals and other small changes. However, these simple changes adds a lot to the song. Pop didn't have many great songs besides the singles, but this was one of them.    Until The End Of The World - Another great from Achtung Baby.    The Hands That Built America - The other new song of the collection. Pretty good, but not as good as Electrical Storm.    Discotheque (New Mix) - Never understood why it was such a big hit, but the new mix presented here makes it seem a little better...    Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me - Now we're talkin'! Possibly the best rocker they recorded in the 90's, and one of my favs.    Staring At The Sun (New Mix) - The one song where remixing didn't help. The album version is much better.    Numb (New Mix) - Great to see this song on this album. The new mix makes The Edge's vocals so much clearer (you might actually hear what he's saying now!) and other small changes.    The First Time - Another surprise! Never released as a single, this one from Zooropa is presented in the album version. A very good way to end the album.    Now, there is always that little deal with Greatest Hits albums. That is, why wasn't that song on there? Many great songs are missing. Just a few here...  Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, The Fly, Zoo Station, Zooropa, Lemon, Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car (hey, Gone is on this album! It could have been possible.), Last Night On Earth, Please, If God Would Send His Angels, Mofo.    However, the thing about this album is that what is here is incredible. A great intro to 90's era U2 and an album long time U2 fans should get because of the new songs and new mixes. Highly recommended!

B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I think this is my favorite Stanley Kubrick film,and he has so many great films.Barry Lyndon is a great screenplay surrounded by wonderful scenery draped in the elegant costumes of the eighteenth century,and enveloped in the beautiful timeless music that came from the age.Stanley Kubrick's brings out a superb performance by Ryan O'Neal,and Marisa Berenson in this poignant tale of an Irish youth struggles and travails of making his place in an era where good fortune and ruthlessness go hand and hand in making ones mark in society.I enjoy this film everytime I see it.
B002Q9MZHE|4.0|Beautifully done with total realism regarding sets, etc. Was disappointed in the voice dubbing, tho'. Thought it took away some from the \\"genuine feel\\" during some vocals.

B002ZG997M|3.0|In a post apocalyptic world, the Book of Eli makes you wonder what kind of minds would it take to survive in a barren, unforgiving dystopia formerly known as Earth. Enter Denzel Washington as Eli, who may or may not be insane after wandering westward for the last 30 years through an ashen wasteland, and Gary Oldman as Carnegie, his eventual nemesis, and a man who apparently was ready to welcome the apocalypse with a big flinty hug. The First half of the film is well done and eerie, beginning with a brief, but fascinating hunt involving a a scrawny cat, as well as a beautifully executed silhouette fight scene straight out of a comic book. Eli is intense and mythical as he moves through a wonderfully rendered world of muddy browns and wounded skies that offer him his only comfort. His tools include a bow and arrow for catching dinner, a terribly sharp mid length blade that would do a Klingon proud and can slice and dice baddies with ease, and a battered Ipod for entertainment. Apparently Steve jobs built it to survive Armageddon--who knew! When the film reaches the outpost sequence it changes quite dramatically. Oldman and Washington play their roles to perfection as a life and death struggle ensues between the two (Eli has something Carnegie would love to get his dirty paws on to make him king of the world.) Mila Kunis, seeming more then a bit miscast in this film, manages to hold her own in Scenes with Oldman, Jennifer Beales who plays her mother, and Washington, as she forces her way into Eli's lonely existence and becomes his companion. There is religious overtone to this film that may or may not turn you off, but the film balances it with powerful action sequences and great humor. There are also a few huge twists at the end that are well executed. Be sure not to tell anyone what they are after you have seen it. Overall a solid, engrossing film that will entertain you without a doubt. Three stars all around.

0316001821|3.0|So Suzie Salmon is this 14-year-old girl, brutally raped and murdered. Gone to Heaven, and watched how her family struggled and coped, all this years because of her death. I came to, first, hate, then love this book. I hated it because the author is so deep in details. Tiny details. And to love it, because it make me think about death, in way, that it's not bad, and that sooner or later, will happen to all of us. I love the fact of how she was fascinated of all living thing; the fact that took her ten years to accept that she has dead, ten years for her to leave, to move on; and to let her family to move on from her death. Ten years took a family to recover. The book,at first for me, was hard to read; even a little boring, but I came to love it, because it gave another different perspective of death. I won't praise this book, I have read better books...but I won't say it's not a good book. Give it a try. If you don't like it, you can return it. But give yourself the opportunity to read something different. I loved this line from the book \\"When was it all right to let go not only of the dead but of the living-to learn to accept?\\"
B0001ARCFA|5.0|Besides these headphones I also own a pair of Sony MDR-7506's so I may make some comparisons in this review. Being a producer of electronic music, I need a pair of headphones that are accurate. These headphones are some of the best I've heard as far as accuracy. Compared to the MDR-7506's these headphones sound a bit duller but only because they do not exaggerate the highs like the Sony's do. They are open so anyone used to big booming bass (which is never good anyway) will be disappointed at first. Do not buy these headphones if you plan to listen to low-quality music through them, they will sound horrible.
0670021652|5.0|I found this book exciting, compelling, moving, thought-provoking, and surprising.  More than a memoir or a history, it shows why research and scholarship matter -- because they stage wrestling matches between ideas, and help us make sense of the world and of our personal lives.  The mainstream press has been snarky about this book, but  as a university professor who specializes in the history of marriage, I can say that COMMITTED is more accurate, balanced and thoughtful than most academic books on marriage. That's because Gilbert is not trying to prove a point but to figure out a problem.  Whether or not you find her personal voice charming or irritating (I found it mostly charming), you will learn a lot from watching a very intelligent person who is in touch with her emotions use knowledge to figure out how to reconcile what she believes in with what she has to do -- get married.
031606792X|5.0|I felt compelled to reply that I totally get it. I understand the character's motivations and SMeyer's summation of the series with BD's plot line. Thank you, SM for introducing this amazing world and these characters that we are yearning to hear more about and care so deeply for the direction in which their lives lead. Thank you for the journey.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|I am now the coolest father ever. According to my 12yr old step-daughter. Now on the actual parent side, Great value for the price, a fine little girl role model (for now) and not too painful for Dad to have to listen to with her in the car.
B002Y5FKUE|3.0|I should start off to say that the entire cast was probably the ideal for this show. Florez and Dessay make an amazing pair on stage - they blend very well together and are amazing soloists in their arias too. The orchestra was also great. The chorus was lively and sounded together as a group... didn't hear any individuals wailing. It looked like they had quite a bit of fun for some of the conflict scenes.    Some newcomers may find the opera's story itself a little cheesy - in a sense it's supposed to be. It's a lighthearted and charming piece with a very basic story. It's not a particular favorite of mine but the music certainly makes up the missing excitement. If you think about it - this is a very elaborate opera of a simple misunderstanding which in the end gives you a happy ending and all are at peace. Really, it's pretty fun! With such a light-hearted story like this, some may say it calls for regietheater.     Mary Zimmerman and the rest of the production team was booed on opening night and did not bow for this recording. It has been staged here as a New York opera company rehearsing the opera La Sonnambula. Our issue here is characters do seem to be rehearsing some scenes and others they seem to be having out-of-character interaction. The main problem is that when the libretto doesn't change but the action does, we have a mess. It's made even more bizarre that there's this conflict that matches all the music (but not the words) and the unseen orchestra plays on  - actors and instrumentalists disregarding one another's presence.    Other times the people don't seem to act like human beings at all - for a literal and specific set and place we have here, too often the action and character  direction seems completely unrealistic (not all the time though). For all direction though, the performers acted with perfection and showed all the emotion in them. The action becomes so confusing that at times it may even be better to look away and simply listen (hopefullyyou know the libretto or Italian). I would highly recommend looking up a libretto for this because the subtitles are also not very good - though that's never something to judge when listening to an opera; it comes with the territory with most DVDs in a foreign language.    It's audio heaven but visual hell. The set itself on a purely visual level with props and costumes and all are in fact great with what they are. It's like a great stage for the wrong show. I should also mention the fact that I'm also not biased against regietheater or modernizations either - this particular experiment though I think was a failed one, and it has a lot to do with an unfortunate mishandling of libretto and direction, and possible lack of research on Bellini and this piece (Zimmerman by her own admission did not research Donizetti much when she staged Lucia, I do not know if the same was true for Bellini).
0316044407|4.0|I have to start by saying that this is not normally my cup of tea. I picked this up by chance at a Boarders store and it gripped me. I finally decided to buy it through Amazon and I am so glad I did. It is a very delicate and refined book. Odd to say that about something that starts off with a 14 year old girl being killed but that is how I felt about it.    I liked the way how this book dealt with the death, with the family moving on, with life as it moved on whether you were ready for it to do so or not, how some people never stop amazing you (the grandmother stepping in to fill a much needed space) and how in the end the things that should matter the most don't turn out to be so important.    I am glad I took a chance with this book. I know that this is a movie now and I will head out and see it. However, if I have learned anything is that adaptations rarely turn out to be the same as the book. Deal with them as potentially two separate entities and you will be fine.
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|I love lost and season 5 is one of my favorite seasons.  The bonus features were also excellent.  The video quality on the blue-ray is fantastic.  However, I sometimes wish I purchased the DVD so I can watch it in other rooms in my house that only have DVD players.  Also, the load time for blue-rays on the PS3 is much longer than for DVDs.  It's difficult to choose.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I am a fan of Harry Potter no doubt but I admit that this famous franchise has had its share of ups and downs, both in the books and the movies (still don't like how book 7 turned out).     Us fans don't mind, we go and get it/see it anyway. However, I have to admit that I have my favorites. This latest movie is fast becoming one of them. I liked the way this movie was done. Its unrealistic to expect to see everything you read in the book transferred to the screen but I for one think that the movie is sometimes better off with the less is more approach.    This latest addition was cleaver, quick paced, funny and heart retching. It hit all the right buttons and is a testimony to how far a franchise can go if it has the right tools to get it there.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was surprised at the variety of music on this CD but I have to say, I enjoyed every note and I am sure you will too!
B001EMS2YY|5.0|They just don't make clean-cut movies like this one any more. Grant, Niven and Young were wonderful as the lead characters. (If you want to know how to hold yourself and walk, watch Loretta Young, she ever graces the camera with her finesse.) This film transports viewers from the high tech frenzy of the 21st Century, and gently sets us in the 1940s -- a time when cussing, nudity, violence and vulgar jokes weren't considered necessary for entertainment. It's not the best film in the world, but it has an innocent iridescence that makes this film a lovely classic.
B002BSHWUU|1.0|I bought this brand new off of Amazon a week ago.  After receiving it, I eagerly unwrapped it.  First off, I noticed that the cds were in those pocket type sleeve cases instead of normal plastic cases.  That really irritates me.  You'll need to put your finger on the disc to get it out of the sleeve.  Each time you do that, you'll have a nice fingerprint on the underside of each disc.  And the last album i opened, \\"Past Masters\\", has two cds stacked on each other inside the sleeve of this f'ing case.  I scratched each cd while using all my strength to pull them out.  Not only that but the box and two of the cases were coming apart.  This was on the first day I opened it mind you.  So i pulled the superglue out and got to work.  After all that,  I have listened to the set and I'm not impressed with the sound quality at all.
B000002USN|1.0|Frank Sinatra stayed too long at the dance. At age 77, The Voice was a pale shadow of his former glory. The digitally contrived and fraudulent &#34;Duets&#34; (1993) put the Chairman of the Board back on the charts while desecrating his musical legacy. Though sanctioned by Sinatra (perhaps reluctantly), the long-distance pairings with artists ranging from Barbra Streisand to Bono constitute a gimmicky embarrassment. If you want latter-day Sinatra, listen to &#34;She Shot Me Down&#34; (1981) and the underrated &#34;L.A. Is My Lady&#34; (1984).
B0001NBMBC|5.0|No matter what most people say I still think that this is Slipknots best album. Most so called \\"Maggots\\" would Say Iowa is the best and Slipknot sold out with this album with the stone sour voice and acoustic songs. But to me its not selling out if its still good.    Prelude 3.0 - Very diffrent oppening its actally a song with great lyrics and it gets you ready for blister. 9-10    The Blister Exists - Best song on the album. Great from start to finnish with every body in the band doing there part. Even if you dont like heavy music you will still like the drumline middle. 10-10    Three Nil -a very good song that reminds me of Scream from the bonus edition. My only complaint is the \\"this is not my...\\" part. 9-10    Duality - Not a bad song but a little over rated. It can do with out the \\"All I got is insane\\" part. 7-10    Opium of of the People - Mick and Jim show off there guitar skills in the intro. Its a pretty good song but I dont know what the title means. 7-10    Circle - Great song. Its not your typical acoustict song but Corey really shows off his singing and lyrical ability. 10-10    Welcome - This is a average song nothing special about it. 7-10    Vermilion - Great song especially the bridge and the solo. 9-10    Pulse of the Maggots - This is a good song the guitar in the begining make it. 8-10    Before I Forget - This is one of the many songs on this album that proves that its better the Iowa and Slipknot combined. This song proves that the lyrics improved. The intro is one of the best of the album. 10-10    Vermilion, Pt.2 - The better of the Vermilions, Corey shows off his vocals. 10-10     The Nameless - I would like to know what was going through slipknots mind when they wrote this song. Its so unique There is no other song like it. It goes from fast paced screaming and machine gun guitar to slow singing and acoustic guitars. Its still one of the best songs on the album even though its very wired. 10-10     The Virus of Life - A song with very disturbing lyrics and pretty different musicly. 7-10    Danger - Keep Away - A good song thats very simple musicly but very good vocaly. More proof that slipknot evolved. 9-10    Lyrics - way better then previous albums. No F this F that. Corey has really improved.    Vocals - Well in this album theres actually singing in most songs    Guitar - Some very good riffs and added solos this time.    Drums - drums were good from the begining but I like the Drum solo in this album.    Samples, Turntables, and Keyboard - Im not an expert on these but they sonded good whenever they wanted to put them in.

0316044938|5.0|The first book of 2010 that I started reading was a bore.  After 100 pages I quickly decided life is too short to read boring books.  I threw it down and picked up Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones and I'm so glad I did.  I finished it in one week, and just in time for the movie which is what I was hoping to do.  I've owned a copy of the book for a while, long before I knew it was even going to be a movie.  The trailers of the movie look great though and enticed me to choose to read this book instead.  And as I said, I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />You probably know by now that the book is about a 14 year old girl named Susie who is raped and killed and then narrates the book from heaven.  She views her family, friends, and neighbors and explores the effects her death has on each of them.  She even follows her killer and explores what type of person he is.<br /><br />Now, I'm the first to enjoy a good ghost story of any kind, but I actually wouldn't label this a ghost story at all.  Still, there are passages in this book that I found to be absolutely haunting.  The first of many was where Susie's father uses a Monopoly game to help explain to his four year old son where Susie has gone.  Sebold writes with such finesse and poetry, and yet totally respects and captures the voice of her 14 year old narrator perfectly.  It's quite innocent, and quite intense.<br /><br />The reader is also treated to a different view of heaven.  Susie's heaven is made up of the earthly elements that made her happy, but perhaps she took them for granted or overlooked them like smells she liked, trees, and even gazebos.  People and pets come and go, and all the while, Susie watches the lives of her friends and family go on without her.  The reader also gets the feeling that there is another place just out of reach, which may be that cloudy white heaven where we all have wings, but Susie has to let go of the ones on Earth to reach it.  And she's not ready yet.<br /><br />This is a book that will probably make you angry at times.  It will also make you sad, but it's the kind of sad you want to feel sometimes.  It's the kind of sad that makes you want to call someone you haven't spoken to in a while and reconnect, and tell them you love them.  It's the kind of book you'll want to read out loud from and make others around you listen.  I did.  This is a book that will make you speak out loud to the dead who've gone before you, and it will teach you that you should listen because they've been talking to you too.<br /><br />What a great way to start the year!  Yet another great book that I will remember, and be recommending, for a long time to come.es.  It will also make you sad, but it's the kind of sad you want to feel sometimes.

B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is the first of Sparks' novels I've read and I must say I was beyond enthralled. I had seen previews for the movie but usually prefer to read the book first and finished it in a day. Since I don't have previous stories to compare it to I now feel I have to read much more of him because it is by far one of the best books I've read in quite a while, which surprised me since it's not in the typical genres I enjoy. However, it wasn't corny or mushy so I loved it- and HIGHLY recommend it.

B000QCQ970|3.0|First off, Josh Waitzkin has an incredible life story.  Being a world champion in probably the most intellectual competitions, chess, and then also being a martial arts champion is truly amazing.  Being a world-class performer isn't all about talent but the incredible amount of hours needed to be put into the discipline (10 years being the minimum) and the fact that he was able to do it twice is impressive.    How he did that was what I was interested in and some of the concepts were very interesting.  However, that was too small of a proportion of the book.  The majority was an auto-biographical sketch.  I do think that you need that from a narrative perspective but I would have preferred to spend a bit more time on those concepts and maybe some more empirical or in-depth information around that as opposed to it just being purely anecdotal.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I'm a long time collector of Beatles memorablia. I've already been offered $600 cash for this item, but it's not for sale, sorry. My only wish is that I could find a way to plug this into my Sony Tv sound system. It has an IPod docking station; but this comes as a USB flash stick type of set up and I don't know how do make a DVD work because all the stuff (about 10 gigs)is too much to fit? Anyone know how I can do this? In any event this beautiful work of art and quality sound are nothing less than amazing! And it's HEAVY in weight.

B002L5GQGY|5.0|The Joe Bonamassa \\"Live at Royal Albert Hall\\" DVD is perhaps the best stage performance that I have ever seen.  The combination of the perfectly timed dual drum sets of Bogie Bowles & Anton Fig, along with the laid back bass of Carmine Rojas all in support of Joe's totally awsome guitar playing helped make this music what is today reconized as being the absolute best blues music in the world.  I have seen a lot of performances (in my role as a booking agent and Tour manager of various tours) but I have never viewed a better performed show.  I am not leaving off the horn section, which simply and expertly filled in all of the small holes that the others did not cover.  In all, this DVD is so good that I have ordered another copy of it to give to the lead guitar player in the band that I manage...The Clarence Dobbins Revue.  In my opinion, Joe Bonamassa is the world's best guitar player.  Buel Stalls
B001DTUU7A|3.0|In Horton Hears a Who, the designy world of Dr. Seuss is translated brilliantly into a 3D animated movie. Whoville is abundantly filled with delightful sight gags and a rich color palette. There's quite a lot of amazing stuff in here. The \\"backgrounds\\" and environments are exceptionally rich in detail.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in this film is it's a mistake to voice-cast a skinny, hyperactive guy like Jim Carrey as a fat, lumbering elephant. The conception of Horton in the original Seuss book is a deep-voiced, slightly dumb and dorky animal with a very big heart, who succeeds in spite of himself. Jim Carrey inevitably turns any character he plays into a smart aleck. Consequently, Horton as depicted here possesses both massive, jungle-rumbling size and apparently, lighting speed and hyperactive reflexes too. Every character in this movie either has ADD or is on speed.<br /><br />I'm not too thrilled with the casting of Charles Osgood as the voice of the narrator, either, as I half expect to a see a CBS reporter show up in Who-ville at any moment. Still, his voice is inevitably reassuring. But again, Osgood is not a very imaginative casting choice. I'm sure there are any number of unknown voice artists who could have put some fresh wrinkles into this part.<br /><br />I take this as proof that the \\"star system\\" is a time-honored practice designed to pander to the audience. This system really gets in the way of new talent rising to prominence.<br /><br />Still, this is a delightful movie that takes every opportunity to thrill us with the endless variety of camera moves and perspectives possible in 3D animation. It's middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment designed to attract a mass audience. The art direction and design work make this a movie well worth seeing, especially in Blu-Ray.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|The one and only drawback of a truly great movie, like debut director Duncan Jones' Moon, is that it is a film which unravels in a way that makes it difficult to talk about without giving away significant plot points that are better left unsaid for any viewer.  In fact, I'll say now that while I certainly do not plan to give away key details, I still caution potential readers here that the film is likely more effective if you know absolutely nothing about it at all going in.  Duncan Jones is an English filmmaker who is young enough that we can expect many more intelligent and engaging films from him in the near future.  He is also the son of musician David Bowie, of who I am a huge fan.<br /><br />Moon is a film that stars a nearly solitary Sam Rockwell in what is actually more than just another great performance in a nearly immaculate acting career; this is Rockwell's best work and it would be a shame if he was not nominated for the Oscar for best actor.  Rockwell's character is the everyman Sam Bell and he is accompanied throughout the movie by his kindly robot friend voiced by Kevin Spacey.  There was a time when Spacey was the best actor in the business so it's nice to see him at least voice a character in an inspired film like this.  Anyway, all these elements I knew going in and I thought I was going to watch something like 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, based on the great Tevis novel and starring Moon's director's daddy, the one and only thin white duke, as the earthbound alien of course.  For those who have seen Moon, you now know how little I knew going into it.<br /><br />The moon has helium-3, something rare on Earth, and likely quite useful in terms of fuel alternatives.  So Sam Bell, a married man and father, was contracted by a company called Lunar Industries to oversee a very ambitious project to extract this clean fuel alternative from the dark side of the moon.  His contract of three years will end in just two weeks and he will be free to go home and see his wife Tess and his now toddler age daughter Eve.  During his time on the mostly automated lunar base, Sam has only had two forms of communication; one with GERTY, a robot assistant (Spacey), and the other is just regular recorded transmissions from his family and the company he works for.  The satellite that allows live communications to and from Earth has been down indefinitely and Lunar Industries has little interest in making it a priority to fix.  So Sam Bell has been alone for a very long time.  That is only about 10% of the story but I'll stop there.<br /><br />Moon is timeless, even visually the sets are reminiscent of older films, but it is also incredibly authentic and modern. Moon really is a film about humanity in a primal sense that just escapes words, but it is wrapped-up brilliantly in a very sound and believable science fiction setting.  In addition, the cinematography and soundtrack serve to make the whole picture more seamless and cohesive and are among the best efforts within their respective film-making trades of 2009 as well.  However, it is the screenplay that might deserve the most praise of all.  The dialogue is witty and speaks surprisingly to either the thoughtful or angry anarchist, or even just your everyday thinking independent.  These ideas are of course in stark contrast to the elements of this mystical \\"Lunar Industries\\" authoritarian entity, as they are in nature, which is once again a timeless theme in both general story-telling from Orwell to Alan Moore, and in both past and contemporary paranoia toward corporatism and big active governments.  This is a smart movie but it is also incredibly engaging even in a more superficial understanding.<br /><br />There were a lot of great movies in 2009 and it's been a while that I can say so early on that I've seen most of them.  District 9 was a great movie for many different reasons and perhaps I'll get into that in another review.  I also loved Star Trek and Drag Me to Hell, but it's this little $5 million dollar space movie that gripped me most of all.  It is a perfect movie and I cannot recommend it enough.'s this little $5 million dollar space movie that gripped me most of all.  It is a perfect movie and I cannot recommend it enough.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|I enjoy romantic comedies more than most would admit.  And I heard about this one, and thought the concept sounded interesting (boss and her employee pretending to be married).  Of course we all know what would happen from that point on, but I still thought this could be likable, since it was such a big hit and a lot of people had nice things to say about it.  Unfortunately, I felt like I was let down.    I will start by saying that there are quite a few things to like about this movie, which made me debate over giving it 3 or 4 stars.  For one, Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have really good chemistry, and their scenes of bantering and getting each other into uncomfortable situations are some of the best parts of the movie.  Reynold's character is very likable, and almost anybody can understand where he's coming from.  Furthermore, Betty White still shows that she can make the most of an otherwise unimportant role, and is probably one of the best actors in the movie.      But with all that being said and done, I have to tell you that the flaws are too glaring to ignore.  The biggest, perhaps, is that Bullock's character, Margaret, is not someone you like at all.  She's the stereotypical boss from Hell, which would be okay if the script showed the other side to her better.  The best we get is when she reveals she cried when someone called her a \\"poisonous [b-word]\\" by a worker she just fired.  Maybe it's just me, but I don't feel sorry for people who hurt others getting a taste of their own medicine.  Furthermore, the two of them don't really fall in love for any other reason than they feel sorry for each other (Margaret is alone in the world, Reynolds' Alex has a bad relationship with his family), which is not satisfying enough of a reason for me.  And as I said earlier, this film largely rips off the movies Devil Wears Prada (evil boss), Meet the Parents (awkward meeting of future in-laws), and While You Were Sleeping (lonely girl with no family is welcomed intoone she deceives).      To sum it all up, this is a movie that will entertain you, but it will also frustrate you by the time it's over.  I don't understand how this movie can make so many big mistakes when it does so many little things right, but it did somehow.
B002ZG997M|3.0|By now, I'm sure every fan of the Fallout video games knows that the book Eli (Denzel Washington) is protecting is the Wasteland Survival Guide, while every Christian thinks it's the bible.  The Book of Eli is on the surface a great action thriller, but a major bummer of a movie in terms of its view on humankind.  It's like [[ASIN:0307476308 The Road]] but only it assumes humanity requires religion in order to be civilized, a point I personally despise and disagree with vehemently.  Nevertheless, if we can pretend that in this little fictional futuristic world the word of god is imperative, else we all become cannibalistic sociopaths, then the Book of Eli can be forgiven.  I on the other hand will take its fundamentally preachy storytelling into account as a stern critic. For those reasons, the movie bothered me deeply.<br /><br />The year is 2043 and the world has been a post-apocalyptic nightmare for thirty years.  Tribes roam the wasteland raping and pillaging while Eli (Washington) \\"goes west\\" with his book in his backpack and divine intervention as his protection.  Along the way he meets sexy Mila Kunis, whose acting is just above modeling; big old mean Ray Stevenson, who naturally rules every scene he is in; Tom Waits, one of my favorite musicians who becomes a futuristic tinkerer; a blind Jennifer Beals, who, like most women here is constantly the damsel in distress; and of course the always awesome baddie Gary Oldman, who does his very best Jack Nicholson while still piecing together some seriously cool villainy.  Obviously there are major spoilers here so I'll keep somewhat restrained, but Oldman's character is bent on finding the bible and using it to control civilization, while Eli hears voices that tell him to bring it elsewhere, and use it for better purposes, I guess.<br /><br />Other than my huge gripes with some of the film's messages and altogether pessimistic assumptions of human individualism, I think this was a very good movie.  The action scenes are state of the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.  The performances of Stevenson, Oldman, and of course Denzel, are all great within this kind of movie, and maybe even a little bit beyond those expectations.  Microcosmically and more specifically in terms of its dialogue, the screenplay is also worthy of some praise.  I can even say that the unlikely twists at the end were both unpredictable and effective, however the final few seconds of the movie were not only unnecessary but actually kind of silly and out of place.<br /><br />It's a good all-around package, but if there is a niche audience hoping to see bloody machete/gun fights and some good old fashion bible-thumping, then it is going to be absolutely awesome for them.  In fact, all those Church groups that got together to see [[ASIN:B001JNNDGA The Passion of the Christ]] should reunite for some more gore and god.  The Book of Eli requires faith in god and belief in the bible to enjoy what it is fully.  I'm not so sure I can give it more than a mixed review altogether though, because if I'm troubled by these messages I can only begin to imagine what others more critical of the institution of religion might actually think.  I'd simply like to think it's much more than the authority of the bible which makes us less primal than animals.the art, the sound editing is not flawless but still works, the art direction and cinematography are exactly what I want to see in this kind of movie, and the soundtrack works extremely well with everything else.

0618918248|4.0|An excellent book, very well-written and thoughtfully argued. Stimulating and challenging - at times scathing - but something which definitely propels one to delve deeper into the reasons for belief - or indeed lack of them.     Dawkins' central thesis seems to be that the evolutionary process of natural selection, as propounded by Darwin and bolstered by the amalgamation of much subsequent indicatory evidence, provides a viable and real alternative to the \\"God Hypothesis\\" - indeed it blows it out of the water. But, why then - if blatantly false - is religion so ubiquitous? Evoking theories of evolutionary psychology and the human need for consolation and meaning (as well as the scientific ignorance of our ancestors), Dawkins explains the popularity of religion in purely secular terms.     But what, then, about morality? How can we derive our principles of right and wrong if not from an absolute source of incontrovertible authority (God / revelation)? Again Dawkins responds by explaining how the roots of morality have Darwinian origins and includes a chapter on how the moral lessons of traditional religion (quoting biblical scripture, although I suspect his treatment of the Quran or other sacred texts would be equally unsympathetic) are not that endearing anyway. Why be so hostile though - isn't religion a good thing, a quaint yet harmless cultural phenomenon? Well no, look at the fundamentalists, terrorists, homophobes and other fanatics being spawned by the religious project in increasingly large numbers. Dawkins is unequivocal: religion is dangerous and we need to protect ourselves from it.     So what's the solution, what do we do? Simple, answers Richard with customary gusto: take a strong dose of courage followed by an even stronger one of rationalism, then cast off these restrictive fetters we've inherited from childhood. Grow up, for God's sake (no pun intended), and breathe the fresh, fragrant air of twenty first century scientific freedom! Our experimentshave revealed, after all, that there are no fairies at the bottom of the garden.     This, in a nutshell, is a synopsis of the book and something, I must say, I found to be an exhilarating read. I approached the book with an open mind, determined not to allow the predilections of my preconceptions taint my appreciation of his arguments, and was sufficiently enthused to write directly to the author (I await his response). It's always refreshing to have your beliefs challenged, and Dawkins is an expert at doing that. He also has a brilliant knack of reducing complex scientific content down to digestible chunks (peppered with generous offerings of very entertaining humour), and this adds considerably to the readability value of the text. It's not for nothing that Dawkins was the Charles Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University, demonstrating his ability to explain - in simple terms - science to the layperson. Also worth pointing out is one of the key benefits of the book in the way in which it collates into a single place so many of the classic as well as modern arguments for belief versus disbelief, making it into a cutting-edge handbook for reference.     So what of the key questions the text raises? How can people of faith come to terms with the structured and forceful arguments outlined above? Can we marry faith with modern twenty first century scientific rationalism or are the two fundamentally incompatible, consigned to follow paths of mutually irreconcilable divergence?     I, for one, remain content with my faith as a Muslim after reading Dawkins' book. Although appreciating the validity of many of his arguments, and recognising the negative impact that extreme religion can have, I'm not convinced entirely by the argument for blind and random evolution. Too many holes exist for my liking, and a \\"leap of faith\\" is required similar to what the religious person must commit to. I also found his section on the \\"anthropic principle\\" to be singularly unconvincing. Cosmology and the origin of life is something science is still stabbing in the dark at (although Dawkins says he has \\"faith\\" the answer will be found as the discoveries of science continue). I choose to have faith that the answer has been given to us, whilst fully respecting those who choose to disagree. Ultimately, it's the personal prerogative of each individual to forge an understanding of existence unique to them, whether buttressed by an accepted world-view or not. Dawkins challenges and stimulates us into believing that there is nothing outside of ourselves - we are the sum and substance of billions of years of chance occurrences and all supra-natural entities our ancestors believed in are nothing but the fictions of human imagination. What we choose to believe, though, is our individual and independent choice.
B002T09BPE|4.0|I like her sound. Also her guitar playing is really good, my favorite song on the album is \\"highly strung\\" which is a guitar instrumental. I like the pop rock tones and cool lyrics.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This is not the Star Trek we grew up on, it's very different and can stand on it's own.  The movie is very good and younger kids who are just now discovering Star Trek will love it.  For those of us who grew up with the older versions of Star Trek it takes a little getting used to.  All in all this was an excellent Christmas present for my boyfriend.  A nice addition to anyone who collects Star Trek merchandise and DVD's.  Great price too!
B002T45VX6|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Shakira since I first saw her on MTV Unplugged. I dont speak Spanish so I didnt understand the exact meaning of her songs but her voice is so beautiful. Even today I still prefer to listen to her in Spanish.     I own all of her CDs I could find and this is perhaps the poorest of all of them, which Im actually distressed to write. I find most all of the songs overproduced and uninspired. Shakira actually sounds a bit labored, like her heart just isnt in these tunes. To me none of them stand out as special or catchy. Even \\"She Wolf\\"  the first single, is overwrought.  Now the CD I purchased came with additional tracks and one is the spanish version of She Wolf. It is better to my ear than the english version. Perhaps her inflection when singing in spanish is simply superior. Though, I really liked Oral Fixation and Laundry Service so I dont think its as simple as just preferring her songs in spanish, but this is the first CD of Shakira that I have felt disappointed when listening. The best I can give it is 2 stars.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Susan Boyle and I love this CD. Is it perfect? No. I would have liked to hear some of the songs with a bit faster tempo. That said, there is variety in the selections and I enjoyed everything.
B002PMV9K6|4.0|Although making any book into a movie always leaves a lot to be desired, the latest in the Harry Potter saga- The Half Blood Prince- depicts the major parts of the story. Personally I feel each one of these books should have been a two-part movie to really include the details.  However, this movie stands on its own as a great one.  The special effects are very convincing and the setting ever so beautiful.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|The sound is really great.  Like the idea of the apple.  Hope it lasts longer that some of my other flash drives.  Sure glad I didn't buy the other stereo version offered.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD will not disappoint ! Susan Boyle has an incredible voice and it is sheer pleasure to listen to this CD time after time !
B001VLXNLU|4.0|This book isn't meant to be taken literally or seriously. It's a light read with some funny lines that bring me back to remembering my high-school years. When I read I want to be taken away from reality and this is exactly what this book does. Other than (quite) a few typos this book is pretty good & I will certainly buy the others in the series.
B001T30232|5.0|My dog Andi and I read this book together and we had a hard time putting it down.  Andi thought the character of Enzo, from who's point of view this book was written from, was both believable and noble.  I agreed, it didn't have the usual sap of so-called, \\"from the dog's perspective\\".  For example, we saw how Enzo found to fill his days alone at home, he was bored at first, but found a great way to both entertain and educate himself by watching TV.<br /><br />His caregiver, his owner Denny is a guy's guy, loves his wife and after his wife dies, fights like it's the fight of his life to retain custody of his daughter.  In reading this book, you understand how it really IS the fight of his life.  If you love dogs, fighting the good fight, car racing (or can be open minded about it), and want to get a peek at the world from a unique perspective, this is the book for you.
B00005NUZM|5.0|this special edition version dosen't have any unreleased songs like the special edition of thriller or bad but it dose of some demos and a whole lot of interviews. i recomened it unless u already have the original cd. masterpeice
140011425X|5.0|Everything sounded familiar in this Book. After watching Castle on TV, I related to everything he did in this writing. Good sense of humor as well as getting in trouble with Beckett (TV name).    I thoroughly enjoyed everything.
B002VECLVY|2.0|A very draggy (no pun intended) film with surreal photography, difficult to decipher British accents and male to male eroticism.  Beautiful violin music and some humor--but not a lot. Expect to encounter scenes of males kising and TUSHES EXPOSED.  The theater on an opening day late afternoon screening in Baltimore was pretty well-packed, but oddly enough there was no visible or audible audience reaction.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is wicked.  When I opened the box, all I could say was, \\"This isn't a knife... it's a SWORD!\\"    Obviously, if you're looking for a small, handy knife to keep on your belt at the office, this isn't it.  But if you're looking for a quarter-inch thick piece of metal that will bust open a log without losing its edge, this is the knife for you.
B00004XP57|5.0|I ordered this item as a Xmas gift, and the quickness of the delivery was excellent!
B001P06GX4|5.0|At the last minute, I really wanted to find a 'fun' item for my 19-year-old college sophomore for Christmas.  I googled and read reviews on several games, but kept coming back to Blokus, even though I had never heard of it.  He loved it-----we (he and his parents) played it several times every day we were home for the holidays.  It's fun if you're strategy-minded, looking for the optimum move to advance yourself; it's fun if you just like the challenge of trying to play all your pieces; it's fun if you just like seeing all the pretty colors fill up the board.  In spite of some of the reviews I read, we played it almost exclusively with just 3 people, not using the 4th color at all, and using the full board (one review suggested using less of the board with less that 4 players----we may try that in the future).  We also tried playing it with 2 people, each using two colors----that was fun.  And once we tried our own variation, where we each played our smallest piece in the center of the board to start, and worked out.  That was fun!<br /><br />I plan to give this game as a gift, and I would recommend it to anyone.
0439023491|3.0|I don't think people will even read my review but here is what I think: It doesn't match the 1st one. The basic of the story kept going through the same flaw as the 1st one which means a copy-paste strategy which is not an original idea.<br />I don't want to have any spoilers here but honestly I don't think this book deserves more than 3 stars. Characters in this book are not as realistic as they sounded in the 1st one. I can understand their fear and passion but come on, something is not right there and the way they act!<br /><br />I was so disappointed with the characters, they don't behave and act rationally. [spoiler]: I can't believe how little we have seen from Gale even though he was supposed to be one major character considering his relationship with Katnis and his rival relationship with peeta! I don't regret buying the book but I don't think it was worth all the anxiety and excitement I had been through last year!
B000A6T1JU|5.0|Amazon was on the ball this holiday season. Got this movie the very next day a few days before Christmas. Very pleased.
B0000027G6|5.0|Many of the reviews here have called this the best soundtrack. I heartily agree. The music is outstanding and really fits the grandeur of the American West. It's very much an epic score. I just finished watching the film \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and was inspired to buy the soundtrack.
B00164KYV4|4.0|A story on the struggle to find love that is enjoyable and heart breaking at the same time.  If you want to believe in the fairy tale, this is the movie for you.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Many of the reviews here have called this the best soundtrack. I heartily agree. The music is outstanding and really fits the grandeur of the American West.

B0001GOH6Q|3.0|I enjoyed the movie very much.  I've wanted to expand my movie collection and found this is a perfect addition.
