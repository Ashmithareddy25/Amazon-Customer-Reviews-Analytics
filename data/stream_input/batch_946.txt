B002RSDW80|5.0|I have to say that I truly enjoyed this movie!!  I'm not someone who enjoys every film...I'm usually quite the critic.  However, I really loved this one.  Meryl Streep does it once again.  I also found Stanley Tucci to be the perfect actor to play opposite to Meryl.  My sister and I watched the movie together...and at first thought \\"why is Stanley Tucci in this film??\\"...but it became apparent that the on-screen chemistry really was perfect.  When reviewing the \\"extras\\" on the DVD, it was mentioned that Meryl Streep shared with the director that the only male actor that could play the part of Julia Child's husband was Stanley Tucci...and Meryl knows what she's talking about.  I was a little sad about the ending of the movie (with respect to how Julie and Julia interact)...but I guess since this is based on a real life story...not everything can be a fairy tale.  Buy or rent the movie...you'll enjoy it!!
B0025X4P24|2.0|I wanted to like this cd. I played it several times in hopes that it would grow on me. I just grew tired of hearing it. Ms Williams is bland and boring. Some of the newer female vocalist are a lot more interesting. Take a listen to Melody Gardot, Melissa Morgan or Sophie Milman.
B000ZELISO|2.0|I haven't had a chance to see the Blu-Ray nor the DVD because I've been trying to get the Digital Copy now sense I got it from Amazon.Com in the mail. So it's been days now I go to the web site on the paper in the case and it is in Spanish and I haven't got a clue on how to answer the questions I end up with a WB Digital copy manager which doesn't work either. I wish I could get some help down loading the Digital copy . The other Blu-Ray movie I got with a Digital Copy  worked great but it had a down load disk available. so if any one with the WB or Amazon.com or a kind person out their can help with a down load link It would be great. Thanx anyway Mike mychills@sbcglobal.net
1400067936|2.0|Maybe this is helpful to traders.  It certainly didn't provide any meaningful insight to me.  I learned more about randomness in a freshman statistics course.  Mr. Taleb, a financial trader, pontificates and generalizes about what he learned from the markets and then extrapolates how to apply this wisdom to situations outside the markets, but there is nothing there to grab.  He spends a lot of time telling the reader not only how smart he is but how morally superior.  He tosses about the names of philosophers and other intellectuals, occasionally apropos of very little, simply so he can disparage them.  For instance, there are Monte Carlo generators that can randomize phrases and \\"produce grammatically sound but entirely meaningless sentences that sound like Jacques Derrida, Camille Paglia and such a crowd.  Owing to the fuzziness of his thought, the literary intellectual can be fooled by randomness.\\" (Page 73 of the trade paper edition.) I hate to inform Mr. Taleb of the fact that even if one is not fooled by randomness one can be defeated by generalization.

There are now 64 holds for this title.  There are ten copies of this book in the library but they are all checked out plus a copy on a Kindle.  I have started telling my students to ask for it as a gift and to check with the public library.  When is it going to be available in paperback?  It is a great read that both girls and boys enjoy reading.  It is suspenseful and gives you a lot to think about.  Congratulations to Jay Asher.  You are an up and coming young adult author.  I hope you have more books ready to publish.  Thank you for making my students excited about reading.

B001I10ABO|1.0|My record skips on every song and it is not because of my record player.  The people who cut this new version did not do a good job.  It is brand new, but comes warped.  Better off to buy an original off of ebay and pay the extra $$$$.  I do not recommend this to anyone.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|Alright, I have to admit that I haven't enjoyed anything by Sting, since Mercury Falling, but I loved everything including and before that.  I wasn't smitten by his classical cd either, something about his some what yapping voice, which is a bit ironic since I've been on a huge renaissance music exploration, just loving anything that Jordi Savall and his players have put out--start with his Marin Marais recordings for some fantastic Viola de Gamba playing.  Jordi Savall's music creates a soothing haunting ambiance, but surprise! so does this record by Sting.  I read some of the reviews, both good and bad, and decided to gamble a 10-spot on him.  Glad I did.  This record delivers in that introspective, winter's eve feel which is what I believe he intended.  It's not an upbeat record per se in that tonally and lyrically it acknowledges the hardships that this darkest time of the years brings to many:  The pain of what is missing from our lives. His voice doesn't yap the way it did on his classical release which never grew on me, whereas this I've listened to a couple of times in 24 hours: last night with glass of pinot and this morning on a dreary wintry morning.  And I love the reworking of \\"Hounds of Winter;\\"  subtle, soulful, and wintry.  I love the version on Mercury Falling as well, but have no need to put one before the other, as they both soothe different aches of the human psyche in their unique way.  If your not put off by a look into the darkness and magic of winter, pick this up.
B00007L9PW|3.0|This album is a cheap way for the people that really got into \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to get their Nirvana fix.

0316017922|4.0|there are exceptions to the rules. The 10,000 hour rule is fascinating, and makes sense. Although, Malcolm uses Bill Gates and several other prominent masters of their fields, what's left out is that all of them had ACCESS. They were people who knew people, or by family proxy. Good for them, but sucks for the rest of us who don't have the hook-ups. One has to plow through all the nonsense to get ahead.     10000 Hours = 1.14079553 Years    Include sleeping and other activities (life in general), and you're looking at about 5 years to \\"master\\" something.    I'm gonna re-read it again, it's a pretty good read, but that last portion of the book is really boring, and low energy compared to the excellent first half, in my opinion.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|When I heard that they were making a new Star Trek film by going back in time to when the original crew were younger, I wasn't sure how it was going to work.  But it does!  Director J.J. Abrams was a great pick.  And the actors they have play the original crew like they really were the original cast.  Spot on!  It's almost scary how well they play the original cast.  Anyway, I give this a two thumbs WAY up!  The Star Trek franchise lives on!
B002JCSWUW|2.0|This is Clint Eastwood's cinematic \\"morality play\\" on race, about a white South African rugby team enroute to the World Cup championship during 1995. Mandela had just recently taken over the Presidency of the country and was trying to set the country on a new higher moral footing, but seemed to have as his highest priority, keeping up with the white rugby team's success. As usual Mandela comes off as the super-moral being that in real life he actually is. Only this time his morality is enlarged upon so that white South Africans can \\"piggyback\\" on it in fiction, in ways that they could never actually achieve in reality. In the process, white South African humanity is enlarged by the same extent to which black subjectivity and black humanity is diminished. Whites are thus transformed from the moral low ground (being the foaming-at-the-mouth racist architects of Apartheid) to the moral high ground (via Mandela acting as their surrogate honorary white). All the more to advanced the barely transparent subtext, which is to pretend that Apartheid is so far into the past as to have never occurred. Every time images of Apartheid attempts to rear its ugly head, Mandela (the designated white surrogate morality police) slaps it back down again with the \\"Rodney King mantra: \\"Can't we all just get along\\" and with the moral force of William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus.<br /><br />It is an easy and much overused trope to re-humanize white racists through carefully orchestrated morality plays, allowing them to regain the moral high ground by fiat. What is left unsaid in the subtext of this movie is that as of yet, there aren't any visible reasons to enlarge white South African humanity based on its deeds since the Mandela revolution. With only cosmetic adjustments, the racist social order remains pretty much intact as it did during Apartheid. So the conversion had to be done via a fictionalized drama, a drama cast in the mold of the universal white humanity with Mandela as their \\"stand-in,\\" and Clint Eastwood as their \\"moral pimp.\\"<br /><br />And sadly, even with Mandela (Morgan Freeman) in the lead role, there is no visible black humanity, or black subjectivity. Unless that is, you can call a single cameo \\"militant pout\\" by Mandela's daughter, black humanity; or the genuflecting black maids, shantytown street urchins, or blacks sports fans wildly cheering a rugby match, as black humanity. (I didn't even know that Black South Africans liked rugby, do they?)<br /><br />In these \\"soft racist morality plays,\\" it seems that black humanity and white humanity are mutual exclusive conditions: They simply cannot coexist together (otherwise white humanity might be contaminate (or is it annihilated)?). Movies with racial themes are either of an all-black cast, or an all white cast, or, in the post-modern world, a mixed cast but told only through white morality, humanity and subjectivity. That is to say, it is told only as a white race-based drama with blacks used only as de-sexed props. This movie of course is of the latter sort. Here, only white South Africans have families; sit down to eat dinner, live in middle class homes; go to work each day; kiss their kids and their wives; express love and affection towards each other, etc. In order for blacks to do this, they of course must have their own segregated drama -whether depiction of the drama occurs in Cape Town, Rio or LA.<br /><br />Therefore one can see this movie as either being inspiring or irritating depending on what side of the international racial dividing line one resides. If you are white, there is nothing not to like about this movie: The racist social order remains unperturbed and what's more, white humanity is magnified beyond what it is capable of in reality. The hooded killers of the Apartheid regime regain the moral high ground (and become Mandela's bodyguards no less) simply by learning the black version of the South African National Anthem.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you areblack, the movie is subtly demeaning and dehumanizing, but not any more so than most \\"soft racist\\" Hollywood productions are: Blacks here, are either all sycophants, maids, ghetto creatures, or in Mandela's cabinet. But none, including Mandela himself, have a normal private subjective life. Even the ANC, which ostensible now rules South Africa, was mentioned only in passing. Apparently, a white-based drama (even with a black in the lead) cannot stomach having a genuine black humanity show up on the screen. Black extremes are permitted, but none in the middle, and none considered just normal.<br /><br />On a personal note, I have been to South Africa four times since the end of Apartheid, once to Johannesburg, twice to Pretoria, and once to Cape Town. To an outsider, things look different only on the surface. The underlying tension is palpable enough to cut it with a knife. At 5pm, all the whites jump into their gun-racked SUVs and pickups and head for the hills (the lily white suburbs). Like in Detroit, Newark, or Chicago, the inner city streets are left to the large number of unemployed young Black males growling with nothing to do and nothing to lose. I was told that at night they rent AK-47s by the hour just to commit crimes. Two stars
B000003TAR|5.0|People freaked in 1993 when Rolling Stone critic, David Frike drew comparisons between [ASIN:B00004WGEL John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]] and In Utero when he reveiwed the album. How dare he compare this young punk to a mighty Beatle.<br /><br />But Frike made a valid point. Both Lennon and Kurt Cobain came from poor families, broken homes, and used their music to express their experiance, their rage, with brutal honesty.<br /><br />The music was different as were the eras--different entirely. But the same brutal honesty is the thread between Lennon and Cobain. It was not just that the music was autobiographical--it had the fullness of rock, the brutallity of punk, and the ugly beatuy of the worlds most famous artist ripping his guts out and handing them to you. \\"Wanna make me a commodity?\\" they might have said, \\"take a f-u------c-----ing look at THIS!\\"<br /><br />THIS! is rock from the deepest inside out. Ok, soon after Kurt died, grunge became a brand name and copy bands were selling rage like Arid Extra Dry.<br /><br />But I recently listened to Plastic Ono and In Utero back to back, and I came to tell you, the Nirvana album is the real deal. (The Lennon goes without saying.) Listen to, say  or \\"Heart Shaped Box,\\" \\"All Apologies,\\" or \\"Penny Royal Tea.\\" Penny Royal Tea was what Cobain had to drink to soothe a  stomach ailment he had that kept him in horrible pain much of the time. It probably factored into his drug use.<br /><br />Then listen to \\"I Found Out,\\" \\"Well Well Well,\\" or \\"Hold On, John.\\"<br />The same emotional brutallity is expressed through the raw guitars, the dark energy of the hard rock. This is not guitar playing as muscianship, but guitar playing as pure espressionism. Listen to Cobain on \\"Senseless Apperntice,\\" and almost screams like Lennon on<br />\\"Well Well Well,\\" or even his experimental primal albums with Yoko<br /><br />Of course there are differences. Massive ones. John says \\"Hold On.\\" Kurt says \\"Rape Me.\\" John finds out. Kurt appoligizes. John is trying to conquor his pain. Kurt is caving into it. Lennon came from peace and love. Cobain came from punk rock and pure rage. The times were different<br /><br />Plastic Ono is a therapy session. In Utero is a suicide note.<br /><br />But in terms of pure emotional exprssion, no albums do it like these two, and both are essential to any understanding of rock history.t.

B001KVZ6G6|3.0|The movie was pretty good. It was funny and very adventurous, but it was also sad (in some parts), yet endearing. As a parent of four, I felt like the movie was geared more toward older children. I think younger children would be a little bored and wouldn't get most of the humor. The movie looked great on Bluray (which is why I bought it), the characters looked almost real!
B0000009RT|5.0|Zappa has better music than Freak Out! Even by [[ASIN:B0000009RV Absolutely Free]] he was growing by leaps, and by [[ASIN:B0000009S1 Uncle Meat]] he had redefined the rock album<br /><br />But Freak Out is monumentally important because it took elements that were only starting to seep into the air and talked about them in a way no rock album ever had. Bob Dylan may have made protest music and talked about the personal with poetry that remains unmatched today. But Freak Out is like picking up a newspaper from any given day in 1966.<br /><br />This was no earnast Phil Ochs or Joan Baez folk; cafe music. This was a rock and roll album. \\"Hungry Freaks, Daddy\\" is about the L.A. Hippie scene that few people in middle America even knew of. \\"Trouble Everyday\\" is about race riots, when long hot summers were met with fear and dread by police, the national gaurd, and the white middle class. There really seemed to be an insurrection underway. You would see burning neighborhoods on the cover of Life Magaizine.<br /><br />This is not hippy dippy poetry. Zappa takes what was in the news and talks about it directly.<br /><br />If you're young, try to understand how long ago this was; how different American culutre was. Rock and roll was the teen beat. Dance music for the kids between episodes of Gunsmoke and My Three Sons. Zappa was making it into jounalism. He talks about the times as if you were across the table. All the frights in the cities were put on a rock album. In 1966, this was like putting nudes in Saturday morning cartoons.<br /><br />Musically, Freak Out contains all the music Zappa loved, particularly doo-wop. But \\"Monster Magnent\\" and \\"Who Are The Brain Police\\" are some of the first songs in rock to deal with the avant-gaurde.<br /><br />That, hungry freaks, is a classic album.

B000000I02|4.0|If someone has tried to turn you on to prog, but you find ELP or Trace gaudy, don't give up just yet. Try Hatfield and the North.<br /><br />The main differance between the prog bands filling arenas in the 1970s and those touring England in buses was, rhythm. Where the bigger prog bands did flashy solos, the less marketable ones took the rythms a flash mister might put into a solo and intrgrated it into the structure of the music.<br /><br />You really don't get a lot of solos on Hatfield albums. Their game, and they played it masterfully, was to take these complex timings, and make that the main frame of the music. Entire songs  are exercizes in listening to complicated but intruiging clusters. There may be a spare solo on top, or not.<br /><br />But the way to listen is over and over again, taking the rhythm knots a band like Hatfield so adeptly employs and absorbing them, until you internalize them--you will know they are comming. This takes a lot of time<br /><br />But is not particually hard work. Hatfields composition's, complex as they are, are essentially melodic. If you can picture the upbeat, almost child-like melodies of Caravan or early Soft Machine, and then picture them with much more dense clusters and oddball time signatures, you get Hatfield.<br /><br />Fantastic way to invest your time. Have add it, young scholor. Keep at it.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|I normally do not purchase a DVD and then purchase the Blu-Ray version.  In this case I had to have it.  It is amazing HBO had this series produced, but I am glad it was made.  Even with the liberties taken on historical facts the series is great.  The sets and places used to film (except for the royal palace in Egypt)are so believable.  One of the best features of the total series is the subject matter most films and TV series avoid.  Sex, violence are not gratuitous, yet give the person watching a true sense of what happened in the real world at the time.  No matter which set you purchase, it will be a great viewing for you as it was for me.
B00064WSNW|5.0|This band was not even supposed to be called King Crimson, but named the title of this album, Discipline.<br /><br />This was the first band Fripp formed after breaking up the first run of King Crimson, which had four major rosters from 1969-74. Fripp on this album was working with ambient ideas he learned in collaborating with Eno, guitar styles like those of New Wave bands like the Talking Heads, and repetative patterns like those in the music of Steve Riech and Terry Riley.<br /><br />What makes this music uniquely King Crimson the technical prowess of the band. Listen to \\"Elephant Talk,\\" the first track, and how the guitars weave together in complex time signtures. This continues on tracks like \\"Frame By Frame,\\" and \\"Thela Hun Gingiet\\" which sounds, vaugly, like \\"Red,\\"<br /><br />It is the complexity and the offbeat take on what was becomming mainstreem music--new wave--that make this album uniquely King Crimson.<br /><br />And Robert Fripp being in the group does not exactly hurt.

But here, Zappa indigrates a lot of his experments--cocktail, vaudville, avant-gaurde--into each number. If some pieces previously felt like genre exercizes-\\"America Drinks And Goes Home\\" from Absolutley Free--on Money they are fully intigrated into a rich musical pallete.<br /><br />The album was made to be a counter part to Sgt. Pepper. (Actually, Zappa was great friends with the fabs and called Paul to ask if he could parody the Pepper cover. The conterpoint is more of a rock insiders game than an attack).<br /><br />Money makes points out both the fakeness of the hippies, and straight culture. Hippies being phonies and hippies being shot for no good reason are both part of the story on the album. Pot vs. booze, kids vs. parrents--all those things that were back and forth in 1967 are all capsulized and saterized on Money. The diverse musical map here makes the album one of rock's ambitious and comprehensive albums<br /><br />There are two versions of the album: the original version and a version Zappa remixed in the late 1980s and pared with Lumpy Gravy. He put langague you could not get on an album in 1967 back in.<br /><br />These mixes are drastically different. I personally like the bigger, fuller 80s mix, but it is NOT the album older fans remember, and you need to hear both.<br /><br />Or maybe he remixed it because he was only..........
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The film continues to shed light on (the very well known by now) Harry Potter, as he attends his sixth year at Hogwarts.  As a showdown between good and evil is imminent, the new Potions teacher might hold the answer to the Dark Lord's innermost secret, testing Harry's already fragile state of mind in the process...    Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a highly entertaining, fantasy adventure that also provides for some very witty humor.   Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt one that can be watched over and over again.  The concept, the plot, the setting, the dialogues, the special effects, and the music, are all EXCELLENT!  Though slower than its predecessors action-wise, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince will still provide a great deal of entertainment.  In addition, it is one of those movies that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over.  In short, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is definitely a film worth watching and the series is one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)! 4.5 Stars

B00006HAZG|5.0|I thought this DVD was excellent because it kept to the story and the actors did an outstanding job with their characters.  I was looking for something I could watch in a reasonable amount of time and this filled the bill.  If you've already read the book there are all the highlights you need to \\"fill in the blanks\\" and if you haven't there is enough to tempt you to head to the library.  I gave five stars because this is the perfect condensed version of a classic masterpiece. If you are looking for a DVD that will include a wider range of characters and incidents this will not suit you.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|The music in this CD harks back into history in terms of lyrics, instrumentation, vocal arrangement, and musical composition. Two of the musical compositions are by Henry Purcell and one is by J.S. Bach. There are traditional songs and more contemporary songs that are fashioned on traditional songs. One song is based on an odd and haunting poem by Robert Louis Stevenson about the rebellious son's escape to the cold winter sea and his visions of the life he left behind.  Sting's vocals are mature, unadorned, vulnerable, and transparent - just as we might have heard a visiting troubadour in the 15th century. There is a dependence on string instruments; harp, violin, cello, guitar, bass, viola. However the selections are often complimented with upbeat drums and percussions. The Cherry Tree Carol, when given a more contemporary presentation by Sting, begins to resonate with the old Black Gospel music of the Southern United States. The purity of the story-telling comes through every word and note. The entire CD is testimony to Sting's intellectual quest in his maturity for the songs of the past and the presentation of music in intimate, candle-lit settings. It is pensive and grounded in tradition but is often surprising and sometimes acidic in lyric. An artist must reinvent themselves, and there is no better time to do that than in the middle years that some call the crisis. Sting is reinventing, exploring, discovering, and we are the beneficiaries of his quest.
B0027LZ4CE|5.0|This is as good an all around set of Bruckner symphonies as I have encountered in nearly fifty years of following different interpretations. What it lacks in the luminous transparency that Solti was able to get out of the Chicago Symphony or Karajan's superb precision, this conductor and group, neither of who I have ever hear of before, make up for in sheer mass and momentum (which to me is what Bruckner is all about). Roberto Paternostro modulates effortlessly from majestic to lyrical and carries his ensemble over the bottomless chasms and discontinuities which are so integral to Bruckner's style. And at this price! What more could one ask?

I do wonder, however, what drives the price differential: Lego website sells the same toy for 100-and-change, and they also do have free delivery on this item. I don't see what (given the online nature of the store) can justify such a weird price difference.

My wife and I skipped watching it in theaters, but since it was a Pixar film we bought it on Blu-ray to enjoy at home.  Well, Up is right up there with the rest of Pixar's collection of top notch films.    Somehow, they manage to squeeze a complex and mature love and loss sequence into what most would consider a kids' movie.  The film appeals to both adults and kids who would are sure to fixate on Doug, the talking dog, and Kevin.  There are some sequences that might scare some younger kids, but it's a great film for the whole family.  Watch it!

Yet, upon reflection - I was disturbed by one scene where Sandra Bullock was nude in the bathroom and another scene with the raunchiness of the song/dance in the woods.  Yes, she has a great body but IMHO both of those scenes were over the edge and strongly degenerates expectations for a Disney associated film.

The BAD guys use noise guns that shoot noise at people, which pushes them backwards, and sometimes makes them do backflips.  The GOOD guys decapitated at least three people, and stabbed two different people in the eyeball (not counting the three eyeball-harpoonings). The BAD guys tried to dissolve the Eiffel Tower. The GOOD guys made it stop dissolving halfway through, which made it tumble over and crush a bridge full of people.  Later a good guy got one of the noise guns, and it had a lock-on function, so Destro must have invented heat-seeking noise. Unfortunately he had to stop using it when it ran out of noise.  The Baroness is haunted by memories of the best picnic ever. It's unclear whether she ever did anything else with Duke, or if they just had the one late afternoon picnic and then got engaged, but I wouldn't be surprised if that picnic was enough to seal the deal. It was such an incredible picnic that the mere memory of it gave the Baroness the strength to reject her evil nano-machine programming/infection.  Cobra Commander: &#34;This injection deactivates people's self-preservation instinct.&#34; Destro: &#34;In ENGLISH, please!&#34; Cobra Commander: &#34;They feel no fear.&#34;  First of all, I've heard lots of complicated, confusing pseudo-science that makes another character say &#34;in ENGLISH please!&#34; in movies, and this was the least-complicated and least-confusing. I think Destro might be stupid.  And then three minutes later two of the fearless guys fell off something tall and screamed all the way down.  The G.I. Joes cussed a lot less when I was a kid.  I'd say this would be a good movie for kids, except for all the eyeball-stabbings, head-explodings, and profanity-speakings. Plus about a quarter of the movie is montages of two little boys beating and stabbing one another while an old pervert watches. I'd say it's so bad that it's good for a laugh, if they trimmed it down by about seven hours. As it stands, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, and two of my favorite movies are Jean-Claude Van Damme vehicles.
B001BTG3OQ|4.0|I recently used for a big Weeding with a Nikon D300, worked well but after 50 pictures in a full mode got overheated and the automatic function turned off the flash, I will recomend a back up flash for special ocasions. I used with regular AA batteries lasted about 200 pictures. The motor is quiet and very useful when tele is used. Size wise is some what big and heavy, coverage is great.  Pricy as all Nikon product but well made.
B002JCSWUW|1.0|There was an old saying in \\"The Right Stuff:\\" \\"Sometimes YOU CAN'T screw the pooch,\\" meaning there are some circumstances or people in or to which it is impossible to lose \\"the halo.\\"<br /><br />Nelson Mandella is one of these people, that even though he and his wife murdered political opponents, and did nothing but help turn South Africa into a pathetic reflection of what it once was (outside of Apartheid).<br /><br />I think Clint simply never bothered to search out the truth and bought into this \\"George Washington of Africa\\" business. Let's look at WHAT HE ACTUALLY accomplished:<br /><br />Apart from having a likeable personality, he achieved next to nothing in his relatively short political career which saw South Africa rapidly decline to the status of the world's most violent and crime-ridden country, and, to add to the confusion, his greatest friends are communists and dictators like Fidel Castro, Moammar Qaddafi, Yasser Arafat and Saddam Hussein. His ex-wife Winnie Mandela, whom he quickly jettisoned when it became clear she was a considerable embarassment to his political career, is a self-confessed advocate of terrorism and violence and has even committed murder. It was only after irrefutable eye-witnesses offered proof that his wife \\"Winnie\\" had found a 14 year-old son of a political (black) enemy, had him cuffed and a tire placed around him, filled the tire with gasoline and set him ablaze that it was deemed 'time to divorce Winnie...'<br /><br />In his public statements and speeches Mandela is always critical of the democratic countries of the west, but has nothing but praise for the remaining communist dictatorships of the world. He condemns mistakes and controversial policies of the west, but refuses to publicly condemn the genocides and brutal repression of current or former communist countries; he is supposedly a \\"champion of freedom and democracy\\", the \\"hero of oppressed people everywhere\\" but considers dictatorships like Cuba and Libya shining beacons of freedom and justice...<br /><br />While in America Mandela also made public statements that amounted to support for violence and terrorism in the furtherance of political aims. In a speech in Harlem, referring to four Puerto Rican terrorists who shot and wounded five US Congressmen in 1954, he said:<br /><br />We support the cause of anyone who is fighting for self-determination, and our attitude is the same, no matter who it is. I would be honored to sit on the platform with the four comrades you refer to.<br />Suitable \\"comrades\\" for Mandela indeed.<br /><br />Apartheid was and is wrong, but the fact is the post-Apartheid governments have been nothing but corrupt embarrassments, destroying the country. There is no reason to confer the halo of perfection on this man simply because he was victimized unjustly and thrown in prison.<br /><br />I think Clint should have opened his eyes a little more before jumping on a very ugly bandwagon.While in America Mandela also made public statements that amounted to support for violence and terrorism in the furtherance of political aims.

B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Usually the following parts of one great movie will come up with making parts II, or III secondial movies. Most individuals are very let down, hoping that they would sucomb to the first movie that you enjoyed. However, as soon as you see the previews and then a month later you can rent the second and third movies, you know. You don;t have to be a movie critic, they sucked.  However all of the ice age movies I, II, III are so totally awsome. The kids as well as adults loved each and every one of the new ice age movies that were made. You will not be let down, guaranteed amusement for young and old, not boreing, full of action, and funny as heck, just like the very first move \\"Ice Age.\\"
B002IYEQR4|5.0|I saw the theatrical cut.  I liked it but felt it was missing a lot from the novel.<br /><br />Then I saw the directors cut.  I liked it a lot more, but it still felt like it was missing some of the atmosphere from the novel.<br /><br />The UC fills the gap.  I felt the transitions from the BF to the movie were perfect.  Also adding in a TON of footage from the newstand which wasn't there for the DC and TC.
B00005JPTK|4.0|I love all Will Smith's movies, some more then others; however they seem to all be geered to the future. Which is good for sci fi people out their that love futurist movies. I do to. My kids thoroughly enjoyed this movie and they're teens, so that tells you something, if you can occupy your teens for their phones to a movie? Yes, they did. They watch several times a week. They tell their friends all about how they need to get it for xmas. His sci-fi movies never need parental supervision, the language is aways careful, no sex scenes involved. Just a lot of action, mutations and some sad parts. But it's one of those movies he makes that say \\"this could really happen.\\" You will love it. It's better then I Robot, and I have that movie. So me and the teens watch a lot of his movies that deal with the future, and his humerous movies too. It just seem like kids, teens and adults today are really tuned into the futuristic aspects of life as opposed to the scarey \\"Freddy Kruger\\" movies, and the \\"Jason\\" movies. They do watch them on occassion, but they tend to keep going toward more realistic, in the future or sci-fi movies which depics a lot of what they hear and see in the medi, and alot of sci-fi movies today are about true happenings, future possibilities, and that make them think about not just today, but what about tomorrow?

B00000K3D4|5.0|Teenager who wishes and lives in a fantasy world of being a princess. She doesn't want to socialize with family, stays in her room and dreams, one of which is that she wishes her little sister would go away so whe would not have to babysit while her mom and dad when out. Her fantasy world of escape eventually takes her there. Where at the end of her journey through this maze of craziness she meets her prince who is David Bowie, who looks gorgeous.  She comes in contact with many different bizaar, and strange creatures through her journey. The movie is quite old, made before all the computers and electronics got involved with movies; so therefore all the bizzare beings she comes in contact with are done with the upmost creativity of makeup and customes. It left a great impression upon me at one time, and I bought it for my grandchildren who are in their teens. They too, have many wishes, and like to escape from everyday reality. So, this movie I felt will give them a reality check that everything isn't always what it seems. Movie was well made, no parental review needed, colorful, creative, lost of surprises, moves at a good pace as not to lose interest, very realistic, and David Bowie makes this movie really speical.

0312370849|1.0|I loved the cover of this book but that is no reason to read it.  The history was interesting (though there doesn't seem to be much new one can say about WWII at this point). The first half of the book was ok, though not great as she could have used better characters and better words to describe them - but then it descended into sentimental schmaltz.  The last 1/4... oh dear.  I rolled my eyes.  This is very much a mass-market pseudo-serious book masquerading as something much more than it is.  Anyone want my copy?
B0013D8LCW|5.0|\\"Shelter\\" is definitely my favorite LGBT themed movies. It's a really amazing movie and definitely worth the money, if you haven't seen it already. And if you did, you probably already know just how great this movie really is.

0071636080|2.0|I have just read the book. I am glad I did not buy it.    I could have easily condensed the material in 20 solid pages with pictures.    I thought I could learn how to make PowerPoints (or Keynote for that matter) like Jobs, as the title suggests/implies. But no such luck.    The Internet has free copies of that book. Also, the book refers to the author's site for more info, and that site is quite useless as well.    Overall, I felt let down by this book, even though I did not spend money on it.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|This is one of my favorites showing the talents of the Beatles early in their career. I already have a copy but due to the remastering it sounds like the Beatles recorded this just yesterday.

B002UPA4ZY|5.0|When I pre-ordered this the notes said it was 90 mins.  The show is that length but in addition there is the extra 26 minutes telling how the project was being made. So, this is really a 2 hour DVD.  The  price is very reasonable.  You just never tire of this program. I had watched it on PBS several times but still wanted to listen more because this makes you feel ready for the holiday season.
B00003CXBH|5.0|Powerful film. Just as I remembered it from watching it in a theater in 1990.  Amazingly accurate portrayal of Jesuits in South America and the treatment of the native peoples by the colonizers.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|I missed Nate Ruess' voice like crazy, so I was thrilled when I heard about Fun. This album is amazing. It's very theatrical and... fun! The songs kept me awake at night during the first week, if not longer and I still can't seem to get them out of my head. Definitely my favorite album right now!!!
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I loved \\"Rumours\\", who didn't ?    But \\"Tusk\\" was the creative zenith in the amazing career of Fleetwood Mac, it's not really even debatable in my opinion.    Stevie Nicks contributes some of the best work of her career here, especially \\"Sara\\" and the criminally underrated \\"Beautiful Child\\" which to me is arguably her best song ever, the harmonies in that song are a reminder of what makes this band the greatest Pop-Rock act in music history.    Christine McVie's contributions here are good, the highlight being \\"Brown Eyes\\" which is a dark, sexy song which features Mick Fleetwood at his best on drums, John McVie is stellar here as well, just a great, great song, my only complaint is that some of her songs on \\"Tusk\\" seem out of place and seem to slow it down a bit, they are a little too droll for my taste...too AM radio, which would have been fine on Rumours but don't fit as well surrounded by Lindsey's manic brilliance and Stevie's airy, dreamy, mystical beauty.    And that brings me to the aforementioned Mr. Buckingham....\\"Tusk\\" is his baby all the way and he really takes it and runs....far, far away to a place he has never been to before or since and a place few musicians ever get to.    His level of creativity here is awe-inspiring both in his production of the album and in his own 9 songs, some of which are bizarre but madly brilliant \\"The Ledge\\", \\"Tusk\\" and \\"Not That Funny\\" being the best examples.    Lindsey's best songs here are \\"Save Me a Place\\", \\"I Know I'm Not Wrong\\" and \\"Walk a Thin Line\\".    I can't even begin to find the necessary words to do this album justice, it's their best album, \\"Rumours\\" was great and accessible and romantic and full of emotion and big hits but \\"Tusk\\" is on a different level creatively, it's dark, moody, schizophrenic and unbelievably brilliant.    5 very emphatic stars !
B000F9RB9Y|1.0|I purchased this movie in blue ray hoping to experience this movie in high quality but I was desapointed, the quality is at best DVD or VCD.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|A well-done, fun movie. Doesn't have the ridiculous, over-the-top special effects of Transformers2, or the nonsensical storyline of GI Joe. But it does take up the Star Trek banner with new energy, while still being faithful (mostly) to the original. Very good casting. Especially liked Zachary Quinto as Spock and Karl Urban as McCoy.
B000BHN7D4|5.0|I grew up in Florida in the sixties and seventies and my folks were in the entertainment business down there. One of the families we socialized with was the Newkirks. Since my interests in music tend towards the classical, I only fairly recently learned that Stacey Newkirk had become this bright singer here, Anastacia. I can give the historical perspective that even as a kid Stacey was very sweet and had an incredible voice which didn't even sound like a kid could be producing it. I can remember her singing after she just hopped out of the pool! It especially pleases me that she seems to be particularly popular with gay men, whom we all know have the best taste after all. What an amazing story!
B002SM2QDC|1.0|The original GI Joe was a big propaganda to sell the toys. Everyone wanted GI Joe instead of the plastic soldiers in a bag. The cartoon was a lot of fun action and Sci-Fi . Great storyline that each eps could be a Movie. Gi Joe the cartoon has been revised  improved every couple of years cause the toys are popular . The problem here is the same problem bad story line , Over done CG .They should go back to the basics , Bad guy takes something  Heroes(Yo-Joe) go , get it back and make things right .  Joe is an Elite Solder, not a young guy with a robotic suit ,that gives him/her Strength
0756405890|5.0|Fantasy books seem to love some tropes that completely turn me off.  Crystal swords, chosen ones who work on farms, dragons who don't breath fire or eat people, and recently, vampires or werewolves that aren't evil.  Also, there is a fair amount of animals made of stone.  The last one seems unimaginative and simple.  It's like having to fight rats in the start of every fantasy video game, but in Rothfuss's world, a rock spider couldn't ruin my fun!  Pat is amazing, he writes a story that could take place in any world or time, and I felt like cheering at more than one point in the story.  Economic troubles? Check!  Romantic entanglements that are real and don't end in immediate sexual tom-foolery? Check!  An ache in my person for the next book? Check check check!  It's too cheap not to pick up at this point, so stop being a turd and go get this book.

B001FB55HQ|4.0|It was a great action film! The plot, actors, character development and directing were all fantastic. It's on the edge of your seat dram and I really enjoyed almost every aspect of it. There were only two things I would have done differently.   Fist, there was no humor AT ALL in this film witch was unlike the other T movies and I think it really needed it to cut the tension a bit and that is something I liked about the other T movies, especially T2.   The second problem I had was with the end. There was a heart transplant that seemed to come out of nowhere and was so dumb and unrealistic. It also took away one of the main characters that I would have liked to see in the next film.  I liked Christian Bail as John but I think Sam Worthington would have made a better John (he played the role of Marcus). The two should have swapped roles.
031606792X|2.0|Let me start out by saying that I was reluctant to read this series because I never like books written from the first person perspective. But after seeing the first two movies, I caved and finally read the series. I really liked it until I got to this book. The only words I can use to describe my feelings are WHAT THE HELL! As in what the hell was she thinking when she wrote this. Here are a few of my main issues with this book. WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />Jacob: He was, by far, my favorite character in the whole series. So you can imagine how mad I was when she turned his character into a shadow of his former self. In New Moon and most especially in Eclipse his character was arrogant, brash with a 'screw with me and I'll rip your throat out' attitude that made me love him so much. However in this book, my alpha wolf was brought to heel, and by a half breed baby no less. What was she thinking imprinting him on Renesmee? And thanks to the imprinting all those feelings he had for Bella magically disappeared. He becomes almost sickenly chummy with Edward, a guy he made no secret about absolutely hating in books 2 and 3.<br /><br />Say it with me 'OH PUH-LEESE'.<br /><br />Edward: He wasn't one of my favorites in the series but I don't remember him being such a pushover. He basically gave Bella anything she wanted in this book. When he suggested to Jacob that he would be willing to let him father a baby with Bella to make her happy, I about threw the book across the room. I can't imagine in what universe did he think that was a good idea.<br /><br />Bella: By far she was my least favorite character in this whole series. She acted like her whole life revolved around Edward. I absolutely hated the fact that in the end she got everything she wanted without giving up anything. When she found out that Edward tried to basically  pimp her out to Jacob, she didnt even get mad. She says \\"He really would do anything for me\\". Um..Hello, what is wrong with you? Most women would be at least a little POed that their new husband tried to pimp them out. Then she tells Jacob \\"You were meant to be apart of my life but we, no I screwed it up somewhere along the way\\". Then he magically imprints on her baby and look, he's family again and her love for him turns from the romantic love she admitted to feeling in Eclipse to the love she would have for a sibling.  Jacob said it himself on pages 189-190. He said \\"Do you really think that just because I might someday imprint on some stranger it would make this right. Tell me what the point was then, Bella! What was the point of me loving you?\\" So of course he doesn't imprint on a stranger, but on the child of the woman he was suppose to be in love with.<br /><br />Yeah Right!! That happens all the time.<br /><br />Then she goes through the change and suddenly she goes from clumsy little Bella to the epitome of fluidity and grace with the mental control that most vampires take years to come to.<br /><br />But it wasnt until we got to the showdown with the Volturi that this book took a turn for the ridiculous. You're telling me that the Volturi, a group of powerful vampires that have lived for hundreds of years, where scared off by a newborn vampire that was less than a year old. That since they couldn't have find a way around her shields they decided to give up and go home. I absolutely couldn't believe she thought this made any sense. Wasn't the Volturi built up to be the epitome of the vampire power structure. The imaginary boogie man all vampires feared and they just thought what? \\"We can't get around her shields. Oh well, we give up. Let's go everybody, cause this newborn vampire is just to powerful for us to defeat.\\" I know this is fiction but come on, give us some credit for being somewhat intelligent.<br /><br />Now there were a couple thing I did like about this book. I liked that we got to see the series through Jacob's eyes. The bickering between him and Rosalie made me laugh. And when hehit her in the back of the head with the bowl, I laughed for a solid five minutes. Also, I really liked Seth. He was much wiser than most of the adults in this book and I wish she would have developed his character more than she did.<br /><br />All in all this book really didn't live up to the standards she set forth with the previous three and it really bugged me that she tried to tie everything up in a neat little bow. In my opinion this was a terrible end to a good series.r a solid five minutes. Also, I really liked Seth.

0061537969|5.0|A sometimes funny, sometimes poignant story of about a young family, with the dog as the narrator. Though this book is fiction, I feel like I have a better understanding of my dog, and the the importance that pets have in our lives. A must read for anyone who loves animals.
B000002TYX|1.0|You might think that you are getting your favorite Beatles songs here, but beware that most of them actually are rehearsal versions, different takes (some of them partial), there are several different takes of the same song here and there, and sadly, some of the most popular songs' original versions are missing (again, replaced by annoying rehearsal versions). You are MUCH better of buying separate albums than collecting this hodgepodge of \\"takes\\"
B001TW68P4|5.0|i highly recommend this greatest hits of a great band. from start to finish i enjoyed this collection!
0316017922|5.0|This is a must read for any thinking person I believe.  Gladwell makes his case very convincingly for lack of coincidences and what we call accidents in general.  He is very quantitative, not surprising for an ex-editor of the NYT Science pages.  The idea that significant events and developments in human history are rarely random is not very original of course.  Gladwell on the other hand cleverly extends this concept to more daily events at more personal level, like how and why Gates was propelled to the pinnacle of success and riches as a result of not just his hard work and intelligence but also as a result of factors that came together beyond his control.  Even in sports, the arena of ultimate individual talent and determination, we find that there are factors at play that determine the success of an athlete that have little to do with skill.  Similar analysis is extended to other phenomna from aviation disasters to education.    The findings and conclusions are extremely interesting and thought provoking, maybe familiar concepts to scholars but told in a way that makes it very pleasant for the average reader. The writing is very good, though maybe some points are overdone, overall a catchy and entertaining book.
B002RVCD0U|4.0|John Connor Blah - Marcus Wright AWESOME<br /><br />Didn't like the John Connor character at all.  Nothing special.  But Marcus Wright - the machine/man - he was incredible.  He was the real star of the film.  Like seriously he was.  It felt like it couldn't possibly be any other way than that he was the star.  And he was incredible - just a truly wonderful character.  The movie was ok, but the character of Marcus Wright was one of the best characters ever.  I also like Moon Bloodgood and her character, though they weren't nearly as good as Marcus Wright.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I love this movie - it's beautiful, immensely entertaining, and I would argue it is a fantastic addition to the Star Trek franchise.  My friends and I have watched it every night since I received it. That's how good it is.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Notice the last 25 reviews,almost all 1 stars,now when you look at them and read them carefully you have to remember this,You have to remember,look at the last number of posts,these are kids,there is nothing to believe in what they say.we are all smarter on our worst day than they will ever be on there best.are we truly believing so many 1 stars followed each other without realising that they in no way have the cd,they came to rubbish susan and we better get used to it.if there mothers knew they were going to turn out as stupid as they have,they would have traded them in for a pet monkey.go to the adam lambert fan sites where they trash her all the time, but smile,she is world record holder while he is in the doldrums.for instance,on the 26th november they wrote,if i had known there would be 3 religious songs i would never have bought it.are we really that stupid that they bought the cd and did not know about it in adavance like all of us here did.but the nice thing is this.there are millions who love her and these trolls will trash everyone never mind susan.so take it all with a pinch of salt and smile.74% drop in sales and they think he is a superstar,who were they kidding.susan sold more in her tea break than he will all yr.
B001FB55I0|4.0|Excellent movie.  Not easy to pull off the machines warfare and they did it very well.  I liked the new guy, well cast, and that Asian chick was hot.  Bale needs to remove that nasty wart on his nose.  That also should be the last Terminator.  It ended perfect.  Move along Hollywood!
1594201749|5.0|The book is great, and tells a story that is amazing, since it it so recent.  How a country was governed, and the changes brought about.  Nothing is perfect ot be sure, but forgiveness  is a good theme.  I\\"ve played rugby for almost 30 years, so I also enjoyed the rugby story.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I started watching Mad men during its second season after hearing raves about it from friends and relatives.  I am in my seventies and can say without equivocation that this is the best tv series ever. I do not let any show become a must-see, except perhaps Masterpiece Theater.  However I eagerly awaited Sunday evenings and was sorry to see season three end.  This is the first series I have ever purchased and enjoy watching it.  The acting is superb and the writing is beyond excellent.The scenes and depiction of the fifties and sixties is so true.  As a college student in the late fifties on the east coast, I know those places, attitudes and yes even the clothes. So authentic. The price at Amazon was reasonable.  If you want good theatre, get this series. Nostalgia, drama, even humor,  Kudos to Matthew Weiner et all.  Award worthy.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Hi folks -     I ordered this as soon as I found out it was available.     If you are like me, you have gotten used to seeing the Dirty Harry movie re-runs on the tv, all chopped up and edited to heck.     If you are a real fan, you will not regret getting this collection.     The movies are all re-mastered with much better color and clarity than you will EVER see on broadcast.     The sound has also been remastered, and is awesome when heard through my amp/speakers. No hiss and noise, just the clear sounds of the movies.     In addition, you will see the movies as they intended to be seen, with all of the repartee that is cut out of the broadcast versions.     The box is very nice, and comes with several postcard-type pictures , and several miniature reproductions of letters that went between the studio and producers and Clint himself when the movies were being planned.     The \\"badge\\" replica is a cheaply made piece of crap ( and it is small) , but that is not what drew me to buy this collection.     You will enjoy this immensely if you love Clint and Harry Callahan, and I promise you will get a renewed respect for the movies when you view them uncut and remastered.     Best Regards -     mqqn
160094048X|5.0|Go-to vegan desserts - so easy to make! Many of the recipes only require prep time and less than 20 minutes of bake time, so it is easy to turn around some cookies for a last-minute event. The recipes are varied, including brownies, breakfast bars and energy bars on top of the regular cookie fare.<br /><br />While I love the earlier Cupcake book, this one seems even easier to use because cookies are more portable.<br /><br />Great book that will get more than a fair share of use!
B001QOGY9K|5.0|Bam! It's appropriate that Emeril Lagasse plays a (bit) character in The Princess and the Frog, voicing Marlon the `gator. This film proves that Disney's once-vaunted hand-drawn animation is back with a vengeance.<br /><br />The film has gorgeous visuals, engaging characters, a palpably evil villain and gags galore. Randy Newman's New Orleans-influenced score perfectly complements the story. It is laugh-out-loud funny. The romance between leads Tiana and Prince Naveen is touching and believable. The film's strong, down-to-earth message: You can't just wish upon a star for your dreams to come true. You'll have to work. Hard.<br /><br />Folks looking for a quality, old-school Disney film will not be disappointed. Like all the best Disney classics, The Princess and the Frog adapts a classic fairy tale and adds twists and wit. This story of hardworking Tiana, aspiring New Orleans restauranteur, and her froggy adventures will engage children and charm their parents. It's a movie that both kids and adults will enjoy.<br /><br />The supporting characters nearly steal the show. Tiana's friend Charlotte is a hoot: \\"I'm sweating like a sinner in church!\\" as she sops up the armpits of her Cinderella-esque ballgown. A trumpet-playing alligator, a jowly old lady steeped in hoo-doo, and, especially, a cajun firefly named Ray are originals. Ray's fantasy girlfriend: Evangeline, the evening star.<br /><br />The visuals have such power. One shot of dandelions covered with droplets of dew is as sumptuous as anything in Disney's [[ASIN:B00003CX9W Fantasia]] from 1940. Psychedelic scenes with villain Dr. Facilier rival the bizarre scenes in 1944's [[ASIN:B00004R995 The Three Caballeros]] or 1941's [[ASIN:B00005KARK Dumbo]]. A silent funeral in a swamp has a misty, magical beauty.<br /><br />As the first major Disney movie with African-American lead characters since 1946's The Song of the South, the film doesn't sidestep the race and class issue. At the beginning of the movie, young Tiana and her seamstress mother leave the opulent home of Big Daddy La Bouff to travel to their tiny tract home. Tiana's daddy has to work multiple jobs to support his family; as does the grown-up Tiana, trying to save up enough money to realize her dream of opening a restaurant. Later bankers tell Tiana that a girl of her \\"background\\" may be better off not having such a dream.<br /><br />Where have these gifted Disney animators been all these years? It seems they've picked up right where they left off, adding another thoroughbred to the stable of modern-day Disney classics such as 1989's [[ASIN:B000F8O35U The Little Mermaid]], 1991's [[ASIN:B00003CX8Y Beauty and the Beast]] and 1994's [[ASIN:B00003CXB4 The Lion King]]. Maybe it's producer John Lasseter's influence, with his insistence on excellence, especially with story and visuals. Whatever the reason, Walt Disney himself must be smiling in the heavens. Right next to Evangeline.<br /><br />-- Julie Neal, author of [[ASIN:0970959672 The Complete Walt Disney World 2010]].e opulent home of Big Daddy La Bouff to travel to their tiny tract home.

0385737424|5.0|A little gem of a book - a unique storyline that is wonderfully crafted and executed. Miranda's character is this encapsulation of what it is to be 12 years old - going back and forth between this world of childhood and adulthood. I wouldn't really characterize this as a coming-of-age story though... more like a day-in-the-life with a twinge of mystery and sci-fi thrown into the mix. I really liked the setting in 1979... it was a lot like my childhood, so there was a nostalgic element there... Loved the little bits of fantasy woven throughout, as well as the musings and the references to late 1970s/early 1980s pop culture - the whole bit with the $20,000 Pyramid was pretty great!<br /><br />Very enjoyable book ~ highly recommended.
076532413X|3.0|This was a fast read as I had to skip over a lot of the technical jargon.  I think you should have a physics degree to understand the technical stuff.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Most of you have already seen the movie.  But you haven't seen the extras. And you haven't seen the movie in Blu-ray HD.  My family has watched The Polar Express twice in the last two weeks and I expect that we will watch it again around Christmas time for some years to come.
0312330871|5.0|\\"And Then There Were None\\" has got to be one of the best books of all time. It puts the \\"thrill\\" in \\"thriller\\" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I was so engaged in reading it that my fingers felt stuck to the book by the time I had to place it down. Agatha Christie had a great story put into this mystery, and I know that this is a mystery that lives up to its genre. For those of you out there who love mysteries, this should be one of the books that is a must-read.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Excellent mixer for my needs.  Just don't know how they build so much for that small  price.  Amazing.

B000679QK2|4.0|At 45, I've glimpsed through Genesis's songs throughout the years but aside from \\"And then there were three\\" album which to me was a sleeper, I had never gotten a grasp of Genesis as a fan of prog rock.  Kansas, Yes, King Crimson, Marillion (Genesis knock offs?), Spocks Beard, Dream Theater, VAST, Flower Kings and my current favorite Glass Hammer have really been the source of my selections thus far, but Genesis was always a glance for me at the corner of my eye as I walked through the record stores.      So when I had the oppty to get a 3 cd collection of Genesis for $11, I figured, if there were 3-4 good songs, I'd gotten a great deal.  And production value wow, just wow, 1st CD only skipped through a couple tonight tonight.. just sounds too much like it should be the background music in a chick flick, and illegal alien which to be honest after hearing it 1,000 times in the 80's really grinds at my soul.        2nd CD didn't care for \\"follow you, follow me\\", and \\"your own special way\\", same situation, chick flick material, all the other tracks were great     last CD can't complain at all, I long for the old days King Crimson, ELP (older albums), and they did a fine job.      So I got way more than my money's worth on this.
0312330871|5.0|Nine people were summoned to Indian Island by an unknown Mr.Owen, they received letters written with vague details, not really explaining what the purpose of going to Indian Island was. After the guests arrive, terrible things happen, people are murdered and no one knows who could possibly be behind the crimes. As the number of people starts narrowing down, the guests learn that no one else but themselves is in the island, and that one of them must be the person behind the murders. But, who? It doesn't look like any of them will make it out of the island alive...<br /><br />Agatha Christie is not the Queen of Crime for no reason. She really does know who to write a mystery novel. The characters were well developed and complicated, very much like real human beings. I give this book a 5! It was suspenseful and enjoyable, I had fun trying to figure out who did it. At then end of the book, when I finally learned who the murderer was, I was a little bit surprised, I thought that would be the last person to do something like that. I recommend this book to everyone who likes mystery, teenagers and adults alike. It was really gooood!!
B002IYEQR4|5.0|Ugh the studios did it again, make the director cut up the film so they can release three, THREE, differant versions on bluray.    Luckily, I waited for this one to buy. The Ultimate Cut is the only version worth watching, with the Tales of the Black Freighter, and the deleted scenes from the theatrical release, there no holds barred as you watch Hollis Mason get the buisness.  The way it was meant to be, Period.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|BIG SPOILER AHEAD!!!!<br /><br />Preface: Once upon a time, at the very end of December 2000, I had a baby girl...who not only recognized **my** voice, but also that of...Captain Spock.<br />So I raised her, just like I was raised, on ST: TOS. My daughter is so Spockcentric it isn't even funny.<br /><br />So this summer, a movie I was almost dreading comes out: \\"Star Trek.\\" A.K.A. Star Trek XI: The Prequel. I fully expected to be not only disgusted but also severely disappointed. After all, Berman, Braga & Co. had managed to kill Star Trek. Or didn't you see that disgusting, crackheaded mess that was STX: Nemesis? Or almost all (but one -- First Contact) the TNG movies? I'd noticed that trying real hard to connect the original series with TNG (or any other ST series) usually ended up badly. Look at \\"Generations.\\" That was one crackheaded story that was a waste of time, money, digital film and even though the actors did their best, the storyline killed the movie; it was just plain awful.<br /><br />Thankfully, it was also the last time that Berman, Braga & Co. tried to connect any version of ST with TOS.<br /><br />And, almost even more thankfully, \\"Nemesis\\" was also the last time anyone let Berman, Braga & Co. screw with my beloved Trek.<br /><br />This time, they let a couple of Trekkies younger than me write this one, and it was great -- and these Trekkies had been doing their homework, too! How did I know? Because of the very last scene with our bad guy, Nero, when Kirk offers him assistance. He almost laughs in Kirk's face when he tells him he'd rather die a horrid death than take any help from his enemy. Which leads me right to my point: the old Romulan legend of Azereik. Upon awakening to find himself in the enemy's field hospital, with all his formerly life-threatening wounds all nicely bandaged and on their way to mending, Our Hero rips his bandages off and reopens his wounds, while laughing in his shocked enemies' faces. For he'd rather die than accept help from his enemies. In true Romulan fashion.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with the whole movie. Although I have a few peeves with it, all in all, it's so Spockcentric that my soon-to-be nine-year-old loved it. My mom loved it. A lot of people who aren't even close to being Trekkies loved it, and I don't blame them. Anyone with a brain, Trekkie or not, can 'connect' with the themes in this movie.<br /><br />And it's really real Star Trek. Wow! And all this from a so-called \\"summer blockbuster.\\"<br /><br />Thanks, Chris Pine, for not being the parody of Kirk that William Shatner seems to enjoy being now. He's just embarrassing to watch on 'Boston Legal'. I'm not even going to bother going into the commercials. Thank you for being the Captain James T. Kirk that Shatner apparently had a hard time doing the first time around. Don't worry about Shatner's Kirk. You nailed Kirk better than Shatner ever managed to do, I'm very sorry to say.<br /><br />Zachary Quinto literally was Spock. So odd, seeing the two of them, Leonard Nimoy and Zachary Quinto, both playing the very same character...in the same room, together.<br /><br />Zoe Saldana. Nice to know that Nyota Uhura has more than two brain cells to rub together and that while she may look rather undernourished, someone \\"remembered\\" (or simply read all the ST books I have) that she was the department head of communications because she had a doctorate in alien foreign languages. In other words, for a reason...and it wasn't \\"pretty girl in minidress to make the guys look good while they do all the important stuff and I smile and look stupid and make sure not to mess up my hair or makeup!\\"<br /><br />Anton Yelchin. I always wondered if Walter Koenig ever got hazard pay for one reason: In TMP, he got injured. In TWoK, he got a Ceti Eel to the ear. TVH he falls off a carrier and almost has 20th-Century brain surgery. Miraculously, if I remember correctly, he didn't manage to get hurt in III, V, or VI. But this time around...wow.Now he even has a brain! And he gets to use it!<br /><br />Bruce Greenwood. Yeah, really wouldn't matter if he'd done his homework or not, considering that Commodore Christopher Pike was completely paralyzed in the TOS eps \\"The Menagerie.\\" And that it was Jeffrey Hunter who was Pike originally, in the first pilot (unaired) named \\"The Cage.\\" (A little ST trivia here: It was his wife who talked him out of taking the role of Pike for the re-shoot of the series, and the week after, while rather drunk -- his career was flagging and doing Star Trek would've revived it; don't think he didn't know that -- he died of an accidental fall in his own basement -- right before the pilot was due to be re-shot and it was the day he died that his manager was called and offered Hunter the permanent role of Pike. Guess not? Enter William Shatner.)<br /><br />Anyone else notice that Kirk was busy chomping down an apple while he \\"won\\" the Kobayashi Maru...and, that when Saavik asked him, years later, while in the Genesis Cave, how he dealt with the test, what was he doing? Busily chomping down an apple.<br /><br />Yum!atter if he'd done his homework or not, considering that Commodore Christopher Pike was completely paralyzed in the TOS eps \\"The Menagerie.\\" And that it was Jeffrey Hunter who was Pike originally, in the first pilot (unaired) named \\"The Cage.\\" (A little ST trivia here: It was his wife who talked him out of taking the role of Pike for the re-shoot of the series, and the week after, while rather drunk -- his career was flagging and doing Star Trek would've revived it; don't think he didn't know that -- he died of an accidental fall in his own basement -- right before the pilot was due to be re-shot and it was the day he died that his manager was called and offered Hunter the permanent role of Pike.

0307454541|3.0|This book was a reasonably entertaining read despite its flaws. The story starts off very slowly, with 230 pages of exposition and background. I enjoyed the references to Swedish culture, maybe more so than other reviewers since I am familiar with Sweden, and didn't have such a hard time deciphering some of the awkward translations.<br /><br />The book definitely could have benefited from some editing. For example, Larsson refers twice to characters working for dot-coms in the eighties and early nineties, when dot-coms did not exist yet. He also includes the entire technical specification of a laptop in a description that reads as if it was lifted from an Apple ad. Not only is this tedious and unnecessary, it will make the book feel very dated in a few years.<br /><br />Once the story picks up it becomes very suspenseful, although I found the violence to be over the top.<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING:<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />*<br />It also bothered me deeply that none of the victims who were killed received justice. Salander first destroys much of the evidence that would allow the anonymous victims to be identified. Later, she relents and demands that the Vanger corporation identify the victims with the remaining evidence and pay compensation to the families. How could anyone think hush money would satisfy the families of the murdered women? Henrik Vanger, a sympathetic character up to that point, places the welfare of the corporation over allowing justice to prevail. Neither Blomkvist or Frode follows his conscience to go to the police. I found it morally repugnant.
B002BIMNDQ|5.0|This is a brilliant book! It's entertaining as well as illuminating. I often found myself laughing at the foolishness of the quacks, con-artists and pseudoscientists that Ben Goldacre exposes. But, sadly, this is no laughing matter, as these people have such a significant and damaging influence on our society nowadays. Goldacre helps explain why this is by discussing how poorly science is understood, and how easy it is to buy into the alternative view of the world that underpins the 'New Age' movement. Whatever \\"merits\\" the New Age ideas have (and I fail to see any myself), the sad facts are that con-artists exploit the naive idealists by abusing their wallets (and often thier health) with junk medicines, ludicrous nostrums and ineffective therapies - Goldacre shows how this is done, by whom, and what amazing amounts of money are involved.    An excellent companion book, written in a very different, but wonderfully complementary style, is Michael Specter's \\"Denialism\\". Read both!
0767821769|5.0|I love this movie.  I have watched it countless times.  In my opinion, Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon were very believeable.  The 12 year old girl, Anna, was less than desireable.  She got on my last nerve.  However, the little boy was very cute.  Julia Roberts carried the film for me.  She is such a scene stealer.  This is a great movie that will tug at your heartstrings.  If you have not seen this movie it would be worth your while to give it a try.  You will not be disappointed.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|This movie has been getting a lot of backlash from the fans of the first movie. People are saying that \\"It wasn't like the first one\\" or \\"It's ten years too late\\". I'm a fan of the first movie and I enjoyed this one immensely. Of course it isn't like the first one, but 10 years too late? Not to me. Duffy gave himself a decade to make a followup to the cult phenomenon and, well, 10 years later, he gave is possibly the greatest sequel to the first movie one could ask for.<br /><br />Returning to the roles of the insanely badass McManus brothers are Sean Flanery and Norman Reedus, and boy, do they do great here. Also, in place of the lovable Paul Smecker is Julie Benz as Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and smart FBI agent, who, in her words, is \\"so f--kin' smart, she makes other smart people feel like they're retarded\\" (she stays true to her word!). And also, Billy Connolly as the daddy, Il Duce. But, in place of David Della Rocco is Clifton Collins Jr. as Romeo, a HILARIOUS Mexican dude, whom, believe it or not, tops Rocco by a thousand! And believe me, the cast here is SPECTACULAR! Not a single disappointment.<br /><br />It is 8 years later. The McManuses are living a quiet life on a farm in Ireland, and the brothers (albeit with hilarious long hair and beards). One night at dinner, a priest comes in and gives them the news: They're in trouble. A Boston priest has just been killed, and the killer had done all he can to make it look like the McManuses are responsible. Upon hearing of this, it's time to shave the beards and cut the hair, and jump on the boat back to Boston. On the boat, they meet Romeo, a hilarious and quirky Mexican dude who is interested in joining them. After a rough patch, he joins them, and the minute they are off the boat, they are a team of three. Their goal is not only to get their names cleared, but to get their revenge on the person who killed the priest.<br /><br />However, while that is happening, Paul Smecker is gone and has been replaced by Eunice Bloom, a sexy, funny, and undoubtedly quirky FBI agent. Upon her investigation at the crime scene, she comes to the conclusion that the saints did not kill the priest. It was done by a member of the Yakavetta family, who also wants revenge: On the saints, for killing Pappa Joe. However, despite the cops' and Bloom's positions, they decide that they are just as in it to investigate the murder as The Saints, and worlds collide, with more chaos and action you can handle!<br /><br />I won't give away more, because this movie is simply a must see. Basically, if you liked the first movie, you will like this one a great deal. It has the original brothers, who give great performances, it has tons of action, lots of blood, and is a great time at the cinema for sure. The movie is well paced and well filmed. It is easier to tell that it was shot on a higher budget than the original, which is a good thing, you can see it in the cinematography, you can see it in the effects and everything. In short, if you loved the first movie, go see this movie for sure. Duffy has managed to top the first movie in every way imaginable, which is a bold statement because the first movie was awesome too. But be sure to see this! Oh, and the ending.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Seeing a lot of 1-star reviews without any logical base (Some people complaining about the two extra discs they are getting for free), I'm compelled to write a 5-star one, and give some info about content in Spanish in the 4-disc Blu-ray set.<br /><br />The main feature in the Blu-ray disc is in Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital @640 kbps, and to my ears the sound level and detail is exactly the same as the DTS English track, which is to say: awesome. The \\"Cine explore\\" feature also has Spanish audio. Same goes for the short \\"Dug's mission\\". In-movie text important to the plot is also in Spanish when you choose this language.<br /><br />The documentaries contained in both the main disc and the second disc have Spanish subtitles, but the audio is in English-only. The Geography game, however, is fully dubbed to Spanish.<br /><br />The third disc (a DVD) is English-only.<br /><br />I haven't checked the language of the Digital Copy, but I'm sure it's English-only, too.<br /><br />Considering the current price of this 4-disc set ($19.99 at the time of writing), you can consider the two extra discs, the DVD and the digital copy, as simply free perks, and enjoy the two Blu-ray discs that contain the actual meat. Bottom line: This is a must own for both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking people.<br /><br />Forgot to say, lately Pixar films have had such weird premises (Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up) that when I first hear what the plot will be I think: WTH? and when I watch them the first time I'm left kind of unsatisfied after having already known too much about the plot through trailers and previews... But when I buy the disc, I find myself watching these movies time after time. They're highly enjoyable on subsequent screenings. And I think that's the point of owning a movie on disc, isn't it?

1400063736|5.0|I recently downloaded the audio version of this book to keep me entertained on my commute to and from work. Some of the negative reviews I've read here mention how some of the characters seem one dimensional and are difficult to relate to. I would suggest that the audio version artistically solves this problem. Every chapter is narrated by a different voice actor who comes to embody that character. Some are better than others (the actress who reads \\"Tillie\\" is fantastic and believable, but the actor who reads \\"Ben\\" is a little hard to envision as a nerdy 18 year old computer hacker). If you're having trouble getting through the print edition and you're someone who enjoys audiobooks, I would say not to give up on this book until you've given the audio version a shot.
074322454X|4.0|In \\"Band of Brothers\\" by Stephen E. Ambrose, 11 men come from all over the United States to fight in World War II. These men formed the Easy Company, 506th Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. These men started in military training camps, such as Camp Toccoa, located in Toccoa, Georgia and other camps in the South. Pretty soon, these men where dropped into Aldbourne, England in the start of the war. By the end of the war (after being in Europe for a little over two years), had been involved in operations like D-Day and infiltrating Hitler's quarters at Berchtesgaden. At the end of the war, the 101st Airborne Division was considered for the Purple Heart, a badge of office and continued their careers in their hometowns.     This book is an excellent book for people who want to learn about World War II in an exciting way. I would recommend this book for ages 14 and up, due to cursing and graphic war violence. I liked this book because the author interviewed the men of Easy Company and put their words into the book. Also, Ambrose included a detailed map of Europe, showing the men's routes and conquered cities. The only weakness of this book is that when allied members of the US came into the book, there were so many names that it got confusing. I am a big fan of WWII books, and this is my new favorite.                                  TYLER
B002PMV9K6|4.0|I've reserved my review of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince until now for several reasons.   I learned my lesson after first hating the Prisoner of Azkaban and then realizing it was the best of the Potter movie series after seeing it the second time. After three viewings of HFP, I still have some major issues with the altering of the plot but have discovered that it isn't as bad as I first thought when coming out of the movie theater.    Like most Potter fans who have read all the books, I sorely miss the subplots involving Fleur, Bill and Charlie, Tonks and Lupin.  I hate that Tonks wasn't the one to rescue Harry from the train.  I balked at the horrible destruction of the burrows.  I really wanted to see more Alan Rickman--you can never get enough of Alan Rickman.  I wished for more of Maggie Smith, but after realizing her battle with cancer during the filming, I give her props for her courage in going ahead.  Ms. Smith is a giant among actresses with a wonderful list of great films to her credit, but she will always be the one and only Professor McGonagall in my mind and no replacement would be possible.    My greatest beef was the anticlimactic ending--in the book, the fight going on with the death eaters and the Army of Dumbledore, along with death of Dumbledore was much more exciting and emotionally moving.  I sorely missed the grandeur of Dumbledore's funeral--which truly illustrated Dumbledore's greatness and how much he was loved by all creatures.  This was the biggest problem of all, along with the poor musical score (a sad rehashing of the last movie bits along with some forgettable fillers).  Please, oh please, pay John Williams anything he wants--beg him if you have to--to write the score for final two movies!      However, after my third time viewing the movie, I have to admit that the acting was better than ever, the dialogue was great, the chemistry between the actors has matured and solidified delightfully, the actor for Professor Slughorn wassuperior even to the character in the book, and Michael Gambon has finally filled the great shoes of Richard Harris.  The actors were the best part of the movie--perfect casting!      I give this movie three out of four stars after giving it a real chance and trying to overcome my personal objections to the huge changes from the book (which was simply amazing).  I'm sure in time many Potter fans who were disappointed with this chapter in the series will forgive these mistakes and accept it as it is--a valuable part of the Harry Potter series.

B000SEGCRS|3.0|Although I read the reviews and absorbed the critical remarks about Scott's jokes, I thought I could ignore them and I was able to for the most part... and I got it that he was a Photoshop guy and I am a camera guy...but I thought that I could find enough tips and information to make the book useful.  What I didn't read in the reviews and didn't learn until it was too late is that there are absolutely NO photos or illustrations in the Kindle edition.  So for the last 25% of the book when there is specific instruction - - - \\"If you want to take a picture like this... But there is no picture to look at.  I am affraid that I have been way too generous with my one star and for sure won't make this kind of error again with any of Scott's books.  Not worth any price for a Kindle edition.    UPDATE:  It bothered me that there were no other complaints regarding the lack of photos.  So I deleted from my Kindle and downloaded again.  Voila, pictures.  So, it does have value to me, tho' with the jokes and the Photoshop bent, I can only give it three stars.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|This new release from Rammstin meets all expectations.  As Rammstein has matured and reached out to extremes of their music, the more I want it. I have many video and music CD/DVD's for them.  Even though I can't understand the word their saying, the beat is what drives me.  I have gone on-line for German to English interpretations and think I would rather just guess what they are saying in the future and enjoy the awesome beat.  Some lyrics are lets just say, off the wall.

1416914307|5.0|\\"To love is to destroy.\\"    It seems to me that whenever a series comes to a close, the last book is always the darkest and most serious. At least, that's how it was with City of Glass. In the first two books, the plot revolved around smaller battles with Downworlders and demons in New York. In this one, the readers are finally exposed to what everyone's been waiting for; what all the battles, mysteries, secrets, and discoveries have been leading up to. This book captivated me from the very first page and kept me fascinated until the last word.    Cassandra Clare's character development never weakened as the story continued to grow. Every character has a clearly defined yet realistic personality that brings the story to life. Personally, I love Jace. Something about his unfailing bravery and deep feelings really drew him to me. Clary, on the other hand, often annoyed me. I found myself screaming at her and disagreeing with her on a number of things. This proves that although I may not be able to relate to Clary, her personality was realistic enough to irritate me. Simon never failed to crack me up, even when the tension was reaching a peak. I believe that Clare did a marvelous job of creating wonderful personalities that I couldn't get enough of.      I often found myself comparing this series with the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling, which is high praise. Like Rowling, Clare weaves an intricate tale with a plot that never failed to shock me. I would begin to think I'd solved the mystery when BAM! Another surprise is thrown at you. As with City of Ashes, I would become so immersed in the book that I wouldn't realize I was squealing with delight until my sister looked at me as if I were insane. In the end, the story is tied up with a nice little bow, which I liked. There's nothing more annoying than a story without a proper ending.     Overall, I congratulate Clare for conjuring up such an unforgettable tale. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great romance and action novel.
B001N44BVQ|3.0|I liked Body of Lies, but honestly, all of us have probably seen similar movies that show Hollywood's take on the culture and the people of the Middle East with of course, the focus being on the frequent bombings, shootings, and dangerous settings that the terrorists are responsible for.    The only thing that separates Body of Lies from the rest is that Leonardo DiCaprio has proven to be a top-notch actor capable of portraying *anything*. He's seriously improved a LOT in my eyes over the years. 10 years ago I didn't particularly care for him as an actor- I've since changed my mind.     Anyway, he plays a CIA agent in this movie, while Russell Crowe's role has been *greatly* exaggerated in my opinion. His performance didn't impress me very much, like all the commercial previews led me to believe. This is definitely a Leonardo DiCaprio movie because he shines in the spotlight *much* more than anyone else.     Body of Lies is one of those movies that we've all seen before. You know what's going to happen when we're talking about American CIA agents and having them visit the Middle East- the CIA agent basically portrays the superhero that can withstand anything, you are treated to the many scenes showing the constant turmoil taking place is said areas (along with the rundown environments) and so on and so forth.     At least the story-telling in this film expanded from Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Syria (and sometimes America and the Netherlands).     Not a bad film, but we've seen it all before.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|This movie is offensively bad. I mean really, really incredibly stupid. Watch it just to laugh at it. This movies success is proof of de-evolution. Who likes stuff like this? Finger painting monkeys could have written a better story. This is a perfect example of everything I don't like about modern action movies.<br /><br />I'd site specific reasons why I think this movie is so bad, but I don't want to \\"spoil it\\" (ha! like it could get worse) for anyone who hasn't witnessed the idiocy-made-flesh that is this abomination.<br /><br />You want to see a good action movie? Watch Dirty Harry. I know it's old and not as flashy, but it has things like acting and a story that makes sense. As far as something more recent, I didn't love Transporter, but compared to this it was poetic genius. Uwe Boll must LOVE this movie.
B001OQCV24|1.0|I'm not the type of person who has trouble suspending my disbelief when I watch movies.  In general, I can stop my mind from working too critically and enjoy a movie if its made for nothing more than the pretty colors and bright flashes, which 2012 clearly is.  I couldn't do it for this colossal waste of time, energy and oxygen.      Would you like to spend the better part of three hours watching the Apocalypse chase down John Cusack and his family?  (Spoiler alert:  No matter where they go, its lurking just a step behind...)  And I'm not talking witty, ironic John Cusack from Say Anything or Grosse Point Blank.  No, this is cheesy, vapid, fill-in-the-empty-starring-role Cusack.  (Think Con-Air.)  The sad part is that, as good an actor as he is, he couldn't seem to muster up the drunken stupor to even pretend he could see the things that were \\"happening\\" around him.  He clearly couldn't and neither could anyone else.  For all the reactions you get, its evident that all they can see are massive blue screens.  \\"Alright everyone, give me stunned and shocked as you watch the world around you blow up!\\" calls the director.  The actors give him blank stares.  Chilling.    The only thing that gave this movie even the hollow shadow of entertainment was Woody Harrelson, playing an amusing Art Bell type character.  His quixotic radio personality/conspiracy nut is funny for about 2 minutes.      Bottom line:  They missed the mark on this one.  It could have been a great movie with some subtle undercurrents of our current geopolitical and ecological situations.  Instead, it was just plain stupid.  The only reason I gave it one star is that I couldn't give it none.

B002QW7ALM|3.0|In the Sci-Fi/thriller/horror genre, this film is sort of a diamond in the rough as I think this movie's theatrical debut was much overlooked. Kind of reminded me of \\"Event Horizon\\" (1997), though I can see where the movie also borrowed from \\"The Matrix\\" (1999) in the development of the \\"sleeping capsules\\" and tube-style feeding machines, and the creatures looked very similar to those in \\"The Descent\\" (2005) but with technology adaptations. That's okay though, most movies borrow from each other anyway.<br /><br />I give it 3-stars because the movie was rather slow-going in the beginning and it didn't really gain my interest until we were about in the last third of the film. This is one you have to sit through to get the pay-off at the end of the film. Plus, I have seen my fair share of \\"the last remaining humans\\" fighting for humanity and attempting to destroy the creatures that threaten humanity, so the whole middle third of the movie which dealt with that theme and was little more than an action film something like \\"The Blade\\" (1998) didn't really interest me. Though perhaps if you haven't seen as many films as I have, you might find it unique or enjoyable.<br /><br />However, the last third of the movie was quite entertaining and really makes it worth watching the film. There are a couple of twists at the end, no spoilers here, watch it for yourself!<br /><br />Final Grade: B-

0440237688|4.0|The Giver was a somewhat difficult book to understand, and there are a diversity of opinions that come after reading it. The tone of this novel was suspenseful. Readers want to keep reading; to find out what happens to Jonas next. The ending probably has the most opinions considering how it's not straight forward with what happens. Lois Lowry said that she wrote this ending so that readers could create their own ending. Some might think he made it Elsewhere, passed away or maybe even was dreaming. I, on the other hand, believe he was not dead but dying.<br /> The Giver is a novel some people don't plan on liking, but they are soon proven wrong the more into the book they get. This book is about a child, merely eleven years old, who lives in an immensely controlled society where there is no color, pain, emotion, poverty, crime or illness. Everything is meticulously planned and organized. Once one turns twelve, or becomes a Twelve, he or she is assigned an assignment, or job. Jonas, however, is assigned a very honored assignment in the community. He is assigned Receiver of Memory. Jonas was very apprehensive in the beginning, but the more into training he gets, the more he learns about the community. He discovers the secret of Release also. He decides he's tired of living in a world with no color or love, so he leaves, taking a new child, Gabe, with him.<br /> Jonas then leaves, taking the child scheduled for Release come morning. He leaves taking his life, his memories, along with him until they fade off back to the place he once believed was home. They make it through sunshine, pouring rain and harsh snow. Do they really make it through the snow? As for Jonas, no. Gabe may live on, but in the end Jonas is dying. Some say before you die, your life flashes before your eyes. This is what is happening to Jonas, what he has left of his memories he can see; the house, family, lights, color and love. His memories were his life, and he sees them before he dies. Yet, he heard something, something he knew to be music. The Giver never gave him any memory of music, but he can hear it. Jonas is now hearing beyond. The Giver did it, and now Jonas is too. Passing away must have lead him to finally doing so. All in all, The Giver is a suspenseful novel that keeps people reading with an interesting twist in the end.ing, something he knew to be music.

B001MS7IBS|3.0|We really like the show and because of this, and so I am giving it three stars. But we are not happy at all with the product we received.  As with other reviews the menu is next to impossible to navigate. There is definitely a problem with the menuing on these discs.  We personally think they simply forgot to include a top menu.  We are using a Sony Blu-Ray and each disc starts playing automatically (like every other Warner show we own), but nothing allows us to select the episode.  When we select top menu, the episode name is displayed, along with any special features and we can select the special features, but we cannot select the episode to watch.  Only tabbing through the chapters gets us to the next episode.
B000RHKARO|5.0|Arriving in California in late July 1968 for a 3-week vacation, Mayall met other like-minded people and it prompted a splurge of songs from him that musically documented his feelings of elation and finally belonging. When he got back to Britain, he took his new stripped-down 4-piece band into Decca's Studios in West Hampstead for a 3-day session - 26 to 28 August 1968 - and out popped what many feel is his best album - &#34;Blues From Laurel Canyon&#34; - the entire record infused with reinvigoration and purpose.<br /><br />The band for the session was:<br />JOHN MAYALL - Guitar, Harmonica, Keyboards & Vocals<br />MICK TAYLOR - Guitars<br />STEPHEN THOMPSON - Bass<br />COLIN ALLEN - Drums & Tablas<br /><br />UK released September 2007 – “Blues From Laurel Canyon” by JOHN MAYALL on Decca 984 083-9 (Barcode 0602498408391) is an Expanded CD and plays out as follows (61:11 minutes).<br /><br />1. Vacation<br />2. Walking On Sunset<br />3. Laurel Canyon Home<br />4. 2401<br />5. Ready To Ride<br />6. Medicine Man<br />7. Somebody’s Acting Like A Child [Side 2]<br />8. The Bear<br />9. Miss James<br />10. First Time Alone<br />11. Long Gone Midnight<br />12. Fly Tomorrow<br />Tracks 1 to 12 are the album “Blues From Laurel Canyon” – released November 1968 in the UK on Decca LK 4972 (Mono) and LKS 4972 (Stereo). It was issued only in Stereo in the USA on London PS 545 (the Stereo mix is used for the CD).<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS:<br />13. 2401 (Single Version) – Non-Album Version – B-side to “The Bear” which was released as a UK 7” single in November 1968 on Decca F 12846<br /><br />14. Wish You Were Here (Live) – Recorded in Sweden, December 1968. First issued April 1983 on the “Primal Solos” LP in the UK on Decca TAB 66.<br /><br />The Stereo version has been used for this remaster with two bonus tracks thrown in. First up is a &#34;single version&#34; of &#34;2401&#34;, the B-side of the &#34;The Bear&#34; which issued on 45 on Decca F 12846 in November 1968 in the UK; second is a rare eight and half minute live version of &#34;Wish You Were Here&#34; recorded in Sweden in December 1968 with the same band as the album line-up (it was first released on the &#34;Primal Solos&#34; LP in 1977 on London LC 50003 in the USA and then in 1983 in the UK on Decca TAB 66). A real let down however is that the MONO mix didn't make the CD - but in fairness to the compilers - even if you drop the twelve and half minutes of the two bonus tracks - it would have been a push to get both versions on here intact - and the live track is a great addition - especially for fans of this wonderful band line-up.<br /><br />Co-produced by MIKE VERNON (of Blue Horizon fame), the sound quality achieved on the original vinyl albums was famously superb and PASCHAL BYRNE of Audio Archiving has only amplified that in this truly fantastic remaster - ballsy, clean and beautifully clear. The 16-page booklet features the original Mayall liner notes, the lyrics and a detailed and affectionate appraisal of the album by noted writer and project co-ordinator MARK POWELL. There are even outtake photos from the album cover shoot.<br /><br />The LP itself played like his emotions - tracks segue into each other, which either lifts the mood up or down depending on the tempo of the song - a clever representation of what he was feeling - jumping one moment, mellow the next.  Highlights include the blisteringly good &#34;Walking On Sunset&#34; (lyrics above) which itself segues into the slinky and fabulous piano blues of &#34;Laurel Canyon Home&#34; which name-checks Zappa's girl-group signing &#34;The GTO's&#34; - while genuinely lamenting his departure from that Californian suburb in the lyrics &#34;...here's a way of living that I will sorely miss...&#34;<br /><br />&#34;The Bear&#34; was a tribute to Canned Heat's lead singer BOB HITE while the quietly plaintive &#34;First Time Alone&#34; features the (barely audible) echoed licks of PETER GREEN asa guest guitarist.

B002NXSRVG|5.0|If you need a movie that doesn't try to be anything other than what it is, that's also a pure action movie, then you've just described G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra perfectly. Coming from Director Steven Sommers, who after 'Van Helsing' stopped taking himself seriously, doesn't really take anything seriously in this movie. There is a plot, that tries to take itself seriously, but towards the middle of the movie I think it just gives up and throws in Cobra's story every once and a while. And yes, if you try to give the bad guys motivation, 9 times out of 10 it fails, and watching this film it's a 4 out of 4.<br /><br />Channing Tatum, that \\"cute\\" guy with the Army haircut takes on the burden of playing G.I. Joe, sure, it's technically an organization, but he's basically an action figure in this movie, and his acting attests to that. But even with all this, I did find his character somewhat interesting in that he's this super soldier, but no matter what he does he's a screw-up. He tries to help his friend, his face gets Vadarized. He tries to save the Eiffel Tower, it's partially intact when it topples over and kills a ton of people. If the filmmakers care about character development in the sequel, this feature to the character would be very interesting to expand on. The rest of the Joe team is pretty good, but a little unmemorable. Except in a bad way for Marlon Wayans, who stayed away from his brothers' crappy movies, but gets saddled with all these awful jokes. Also, even though Dennis Quaid is shown in all the trailers and is given high billing, he mails it in for all of the five minutes he's there.<br /><br />But wait, then there's Snake Eyes. Channing Tatum is the \\"star\\" of this film, but Snake Eyes is the most bad-a** dude here. First, he doesn't talk because he's taking a lifelong vow of silence, and he's an awesome fighter. Really, some of his sword-fighting sequences are some of the best I've seen in years. Even the child version of him is kicks butt. Snake Eyes looks cool, gets the job done, and is the film's breakout character.<br /><br />Action-wise, it's like a best-of summer action films. There's chases in vehicles, underwater, in the air, with swords, with guns, with fists & feet. Did I miss any? Basically if you ask what kind of action this film has, I say all the above. For the most part, all of it works, it's all pretty cool, and it never overstays its welcome. Also, at home Blu-Ray & an awesome home theater system will mean everything to this movie, and it increases the experience ten-fold. And yes, perhaps the film's best sequence, and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while is the Paris chase with the accelerator suits. It's incredibly self-indulgent with slow motion, but I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />There are also two great unique elements to the movie I found enjoyable.<br />1. The movies makes very heavy use of the flashback sequence to give the backstory for all the main characters, and while it does slow it down some because there's not really any action to them, I applaud the effort and I found them pretty engaging.<br />2. Having seen a lot of these future technology weapons on the History Channel, it's pretty cool seeing the movie making heavy use of this advanced technology working the way it would really work, and not a Hollywood version of it. Somers says all the tech will be in use in 20 years, and I highly doubt it, but it's cool to see these futuristic weapons grounded in reality for once.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, the action-phile I am, and it's a great way to lose two hours. It never loses it's welcome, and it provides a lot of satisfactory bones thrown to the audience. It never takes itself seriously, as it shouldn't, and you shouldn't either, because you'll wind up disappointed. For the G.I. Joe fans, if you're a fans of 60s/70s Joe, it's in name only unless you count the scar on Channing Tatum. As for the 80s cartoon Joe fans, you'll most likelyfind yourself highly pleased since the movie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.ovie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.

And yes, perhaps the film's best sequence, and one of the best action sequences I've seen in a while is the Paris chase with the accelerator suits. It's incredibly self-indulgent with slow motion, but I loved every minute of it.<br /><br />There are also two great unique elements to the movie I found enjoyable.<br />1. The movies makes very heavy use of the flashback sequence to give the backstory for all the main characters, and while it does slow it down some because there's not really any action to them, I applaud the effort and I found them pretty engaging.<br />2. Having seen a lot of these future technology weapons on the History Channel, it's pretty cool seeing the movie making heavy use of this advanced technology working the way it would really work, and not a Hollywood version of it. Somers says all the tech will be in use in 20 years, and I highly doubt it, but it's cool to see these futuristic weapons grounded in reality for once.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film quite a bit, the action-phile I am, and it's a great way to lose two hours. It never loses it's welcome, and it provides a lot of satisfactory bones thrown to the audience. It never takes itself seriously, as it shouldn't, and you shouldn't either, because you'll wind up disappointed. For the G.I. Joe fans, if you're a fans of 60s/70s Joe, it's in name only unless you count the scar on Channing Tatum. As for the 80s cartoon Joe fans, you'll most likelyfind yourself highly pleased since the movie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.ovie takes most of its universe from the cartoon series.
0385504225|5.0|Excellent read. The book I ordered came quickly, was packaged well, and was in excellent condition.
0316010669|4.0|Very interesting.  Makes one think differently about many things.  It is interesting to see what influences us without our realizing it.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed The Lost Symbol -- maybe because I read it at a time when an uncomplicated, and yet intriguing story was a pleasant distraction from everyday stress.<br /><br />It's an easy read, fast-paced and engaging with lots of interesting possibilities to contemplate.<br /><br />I consider 3 stars to be a 'good' rating; and 4 stars to be a 'very good' rating.<br />A book would have to be 'exceptional' to get 5 stars from me.
1932100660|5.0|The most critic review about this book has misled the readers in one aspect due to his misunderstanding of Chinese life style. This reader criticize the book using his own experiences of his journal to China. He see how Chinese live with his own eyes. The credibility is certainly high, as many Americans who's been to China experience the same. However, what he didn't know is a mistake of anachronism.    As Chinese, I have to point out this mistake. This reader said that Chinese eat a lot of meat or even snakes in the diet. However, this is the phenomenon beginning primarily after 1990s. Snakes eating are the \\"las Vagas\\" of the United states, uncommon only in southern part of China (Canton Province). When I was a small child in the 1980s, cancer was rarely heard of. My mother said, when she was a child, she never heard about cancer. We are also wondering why the cases of cancer have ever increased since the 1980s.    Dr. Campell's study is primarily built on the data collected earlier than 2000, when the environmental issues (pollution) were not serious in China.     Therefore, I believe that Dr. Campell's study has strong validity in describing the real situation more than a decade ago.     Please notice that China has changed a LOT in the past three decades. The data would be different today.
0385504225|4.0|I enjoyed \\"The Lost Symbol\\" and am surprised by all the poor to mediocre reviews.   I'm not sure what others expect from a Dan Brown / Robert Langdon book.  At this point I consider it a series, not an original work.  This is, in fact, what prevents me from giving it 5 stars.  There is an interesting plot twist towards the end.    Like Brown's other books, I learned a great deal about art, architecture, history and science by the time I was finished.  Not that I take everything Brown writes as fact - he certainly takes some editorial license - but he interests me enough to look into things for myself.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|I have to be honest, no matter how much I try to like this movie adaptation of the book I feel so much is missing. There was no meeting with the prime minister in the beginning that I thought made the book so funny. Tom Riddle's story as a child wasn't explained well enough. There was no battle at the school leading up to Dumbledore being confronted by Malfoy. Overall, I was disappointed. This movie is the most faithless adaptation of all the six movies released so far. I would recommend you borrow the movie first before you buy it.
0312944926|1.0|Clearly written for the mass market, it is interesting that Dan Brown still manages to make a book interesting.   The language used and the literary devices make a very simplistic book, yet enjoyable.  One word of caution:  do NOT read if you are a computer person or an InfoSec expert.
B002NPUCP8|5.0|Although I am not a guitar player, I can appreciate the amazing skills of this young shredder! Orianthi rocks, and the CD was not a disappointment. The music was rock and roll to the bone! She plays alongside Steve Vai and is every bit as good. She can also sing, and  provides hard hitting vocals to her guitar wizardry! And, she is easy on the eyes to boot!! Anyone wishing to be inspired by such a talented woman should get this CD, and be wowed!!
B0012GMX1K|5.0|While I think that many of Gentle Giant's other albums have just as much complexities and uniqueness to offer as this one, this album surely is a one-of-a-kind classic. Good to see so many people have come to Amazon.com to praise this album--for some reason I thought it would have been forgotten by now. Luckily, Gentle Giant's talent and innovation has outlasted the commercial industry.     This album is classified as \\"progressive rock\\" but many times I find that to be a category all the critics in the 70s lumped bands into when they were breaking new ground. The genre of this album is a mixture of many things, it is organic, and quite unlike anything else.     The compositions are complex and well put together. The musicianship is top quality, and the passion is very strong. Most open lovers of Rock music, jazz music, classical music, or just music in general will find something to appreciate in this album.     The music is not background music for a party, but it will stretch and stimulate your mind, at times it is interesting, at times it is rocking, at times confusing and at times it is soothing, and it's all good.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is an awesome movie on Blu-ray.  Even if you don't like Star Trek [movies or TV series], I recommend that you give this a viewing.  The visual effects are some of the best that I have seen.  The sound track is fantastic, it has depth, very spacial, left to right & front to back separation is excellent and bass dynamics & low frequency extension are near perfect.  I also enjoyed the story.  Remember this is a Sci-Fi Action Adventure so in this genre I felt the story was very good.  Again, I highly recommend seeing this movie.  [[ASIN:B001AVCFK6 Star Trek (Three-Disc +Digital Copy)  [Blu-ray]]]
B00288KNJU|3.0|Coraline is a good classically made stop motion animated movie. However, it took me two days to see the movie, I fell asleep in the middle of it, most likely because of the pacing of the story.
B002XHN776|5.0|This Is War is the newest album from 30 Seconds to Mars.  If you're a 30 Seconds to Mars fan, it's a must have!  If you're tired of bubble gum pop and want music that will take you to another place, open your mind, and make you feel; this album is for you.  It's a moving album that deals with the universal and timeless issues of war, survival, community and the yearning for a power greater than ourselves.      The sound of this album is new and fresh.  It has more of an electronica and sampled feel to it. The drumming is solid.  The vocals are varied; from an intimate wisper to in your face screaming and includes oversampling from nature and their fans.  (That's not a children's choir backing them up, that's thousands of their real live fans from across the world in the mix.)  The variety and range of the music has expanded, but if you've ever been to a 30STM concert (which I highly recommend) this album is a close approximation of that experience. The 30 Seconds to Mars family will not be disappointed, but this album will undoubtedly appeal to a much broader audience.      This is a cohesive album and should be listened to as a whole to really get the entire experience. Everyone will get something different out of the album and favorite songs are as varied as the people who listen.  Just be prepared for feeling something that you weren't expecting.

B000FA5TTW|4.0|This was my first purchase of a book using the Kindle software, and I could not have made a better choice.  The novel is an enjoyable read that follows the coming-of-age story of Susie Salmon, rather uniquely after her brutal death at the hands of a neighbor.  The story is told from the first person omniscient viewpoint of Susie as she watches her family deal first her disappearance and murder, then as they begin to move on and reconstruct their lives.<br /><br />The prose is simple, fresh, and uncomplicated.  I do not know if this is a tool used by the author to help the reader believe in the story coming from an 14 year old girl, but it is remarkably effective.  We follow Susie's thoughts as she deals with her own death, petty jealousies of those still living, and her complete love of her family.  We see the family torn completely asunder by Susie's loss and then slowly come back together.  I do love how Sebold gives us a completely gratifying ending to the story without relying on tired cliches.  We do not see Susie's body ever recovered, we do not see her Murderer brought to vigilante justice at the hands of a grief-stricken father, or a triumphant justice system cleverly solving the mystery.<br /><br />There are a few mis-steps that the author takes, emotional candy if you will to try and provide a feeling of closure for Susie's story and missed adolescence.  They don't do the story justice, but they don't do much harm and are easily forgiven.  Overall, after finishing this book the reader feels better for having read it.  It is a sweet and almost refreshing experience, and one I would highly recommend.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Lady GaGa knows her beats and she chooses some good ones on this her follow up album The Fame Monster.    Outstanding cuts besides the hit Bad Romance are Alejandro and Speechless.  Alejandro is impressive with its layering of beats using a Madonna in her La Isla Bonita phase type song and structure and mixing it up with elements of Abba.    Speechless is a smoky piano based ballad that reminds me of Billy Joel in his piano man phase but with an edge and produced by the Beatles in their last phase.    That is why I like Lady GaGa.  She takes two (or more) things you wouldn't think of putting together, puts them together, and makes it work.     The whole album is like that.  The songs are catchy.  They have a good beat and they are easy to dance to.    This album has that hip happening beat all the kids are raving about and yet a 51 year old man like me can enjoy because it reminds me of the music I listened to and bought but has a whole new edge.    I found the album to be incredibly well produced and thought out.  Didn't mind the edit of the word in Bad Romance.      I have not bought an album of popular music that wasn't something I used to own on vinyl since Maroon 5's debut.  I have purchased both of Lady gaga's albums and have found them both to be quite listenable and can play them both all the way through.

B002QGUFWE|4.0|When I first heard Lady Gaga, the jaded listener in me came out and dismissed her as yet another in-shape blond girl with a decent singing voice who records \\"dance-pop\\" music.  I thought the lyrics and structure of \\"Just Dance\\" were borderline-infantile (which tends to go hand-in-hand with flash-in-a-pan, dime-a-dozen white girls who are desperate to be famous, and must rely on producers and record label execs to make that happen).  I figured she was likely to have one big club hit, and then nobody would remember her.  I was also extremely irritated that it seemed that she got a bit of an attention boost when people started making assertions that Christina Aguilera was trying to copy her.  (Those who know me personally know that Christina is near and dear to my heart.)  However, I eventually had to get over all of this as I heard \\"Poker Face\\" and \\"LoveGame\\" and realized that there was something different about this particular blond pop star.  After seeing a video of her performance from American Idol (where I believe she performed \\"Poker Face\\", reinterpreting the beginning of it as a kind of lounge-pianist/singer-meets-classical-violin duet), it became very clear to me that the world had no idea what kind of pop star had been steadily rising on radio play charts.  Lady Gaga is clearly a woman who is quite musically educated, inventive, curious, and driven.    As I'm sure most of the people checking out this version of the album know, the deluxe edition is simply The Fame and The Fame Monster in one bundle.  I ended up waiting to buy this version of the album so that I could save some money.  The Fame album is a great debut album for Gaga.  While \\"Just Dance\\" continues to be my least-favorite song on the album, most of the songs have fairly inventive lyrics, pleasing melodies/harmonies/rhythms, and utilize the potential for diversity of electronic sounds to its fullest extent.  And while \\"Starstruck\\" could irritate many listeners for sounding a bit too much like thevocoder-heavy R&B/hip-hop music that is currently infiltrating the radio, there's something different about this song.  Lady Gaga just puts this unique stylistic spin on it.  There's also something delightful about the rebelliousness implied when an artist who clearly doesn't need Auto-Tune chooses to defiantly use it anyway.    The Fame Monster is almost a completely different story.  There's even more of a darkness that permeates this LP/EP hybrid.  (Once again, those who know me well know how much I enjoy artists who aren't afraid to take their music to a dark place.)  The Fame Monster has actually managed to completely sell me on Lady Gaga.  It's fascinating that she has been able to crank out such a consistent and improved follow-up to her previous album in such a short amount of time, and only serves as a testament to her wonderful understanding of music and art.  The drama of \\"Bad Romance\\" and \\"Alejandro\\" might appeal very strongly to those who are classically-trained, while \\"Speechless\\" is a ballad feels like it could have been ripped right out of a Broadway rock musical.  \\"Monster\\", \\"Dance in the Dark\\", \\"Telephone\\", and \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" are obviously very well-suited to dance clubs, and \\"Teeth\\" seems to be one of those songs that is so pleasingly eclectic that it defies all categorization.  [As a side note, it seems laughable that \\"Telephone\\" was originally written by Gaga for Britney Spears.  Beyonce and Lady Gaga thrash their way through the song with so much ferocity that it seems almost inconceivable that Britney ever thought she could carry it convincingly.]    It must be stated for the record, however, that as of now, \\"Bad Romance\\", \\"Monster\\", and \\"Dance in the Dark\\" are censored on all versions The Fame Monster (whether you buy it from iTunes, Amazon, Best Buy, or Wal-Mart).  This is apparently due to some kind of mistake at the record label, and Lady Gaga is reportedly furious with them and trying to work out the mess.  The censorship did irritate me and send me into an initial panic, although I don't find that it detracts that much from the songs.  The uncensored versions are apparently going to be released, although I have no idea if any measures will be taken to ensure that those who have already purchased the album or tracks will be able to get the explicit versions for free.    Finally, while it makes me feel dirty to advertise for iTunes on Amazon, I would strongly recommend that those who aren't 100% against downloading their music consider buying the album from iTunes.  The iTunes Exclusive tracks that come with it are \\"Disco Heaven\\" (originally a bonus track from The Fame) and the Starsmith Remix of \\"Bad Romance\\" (which actually does not have \\"the B word\\" censored).  I usually make it a point to purchase my albums in CD format, but these two tracks are so terrific that I had to suck it up and download my album.  In the end, I'm so glad that I did.  \\"Disco Heaven\\" is so great that it could easily be a successful single.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This movie manages to somewhat renew the good old Star Trek saga while remaining very close to the original in spirit. We see how the crew of the Enterprise comes together almost by chance. The story relies heavily on Spock for once: in addition to a spelndidly acted young Spock we get Leonard Nimoy who comes along as well. The plot is well-written, the acting good and the special effects are first rate. It fits completely well within the regular storyline except for the destruction of Vulcan. We get tosee Romulans which were my favorite villains in the series. Again we have a more diversified and international crew than we did have on the later series, where the crew was more homogeneously north american. While the latter series were by no means bad, the presence of Uhura, Chekhov, MacCoy and Sulu gave the series a very special flavor that could not really be replaced by the often very varied alien species one would regularly encounter on the later series. Also, they have managed to recreate the freshness that the first series had and which was often lacking from TNG. Anyway this is a great movie.
0007179731|5.0|It is a great self help book which explains certain powerful ideas in terms of a fable. These ideas are applicable to anyone's life. Following is a summary of what I learned from this book.     We may not be able to control the weather or traffic or the moods of all those around us. But, we certainly can control our attitude towards these events.    Chinese character for `crisis' is composed of two sub-characters: one that spells `danger' and another that spells `opportunity'. There are no mistakes in life, only lessons. There is no such a thing as a negative experience, only opportunities to grow, learn and advance along the road of self mastery. From struggle, comes strength. Even pain can be a wonderful teacher.     Worry causes your precious mental energy and potential to leak, just like air leaking out of an inner tube. All of your creativity, optimism and motivation has been drained, leaving you exhausted.     Saying that you don't have time to improve your thoughts and your life is like saying that you don't have time to stop for gas because you are too busy driving. Eventually it will catch up with you. 80% of the results you achieve in your life come from only 20% of the activities that occupy your time.     There is a tremendous power in a ritual. Sports stars who eat the same meal or tie their shoes the same way before the big game are tapping into the power of ritual. If you insert any activity into your routine by doing it the same way at the same time every day, it quickly grows into a habit. For example, this technique can be used to incorporate health fitness into our  lifestyle. Similarly, any other good habit like reading for expanding one's horizons etc.    Voluntary deep breathing is a very good exercise and is useful all the time. Sharma explains why. He says that breathing is normally an involuntary activity which goes on in the background. But, that background activity is good enough for survival purposes. It is not good enough for all the energetic tasks we want to undertake. Voluntary deep breathing helps us in stepping beyond our comfort zones, defeats fatigue etc. This is one good lesson which I found very useful.     Confucius said \\"Good people strengthen themselves ceaselessly\\". Only a human being can step outside of himself and analyze what he is doing right and what he is doing wrong. Then set about making immediate improvements.     If you live every day as if it was your last, your life will take on a magical quality. I would like to pluck the following summary in Sharma's own words. You sow a thought, you reap an action. Reap an action, sow a habit, Sow a habit, you reap a character. Sow your character, you reap your destiny.
B000ZELISO|5.0|My favorite Harry Potter movie to date. I like the lighting and tones of the movie. A lot more serious than the first one's.

B002FE5XVK|5.0|This is a video that you will want to watch over & over & over - and love every time.  Absolutely the best music video ever made.
B002HWRYJE|2.0|This was a clever \\"remake\\" of the old TV series and could be the stepping stone to a new series based upon the younger version of the TV characters beloved by all us trekkies.  The personalities and even mannerisms of the younger versions of all the old staples, including Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty were spot on.  The plot was a mis-mash however, unscientific and a major disappointment resulting in only 2 stars.  With all the solid sci fi writers out there, why go for cheap, non-sensicalness?
B002QXIMY0|4.0|Among some things I like about this rerelease is the sound quality is MUCH better than the original.  I've personally been waiting for Anthrax to remaster both \\"Spreading...\\" and \\"State...\\" as they both have brutal sound compared to things recorded in this day and age...but I digress.    It's also nice to finally have a DVD version of my OLD VHS. Mostly for the 2 above reasons, I would recommend buying this.  I wish I could recommend the previously unreleased stuff, but it's all rather weak, I gave them a listen but they weren't something i'd go out of my way to hear again.
B001IF252C|4.0|Like many of you I saw and read all the poor reviews on this adapter and was worried about spending the money to find out for myself. But when I ran the numbers versus this route and purchasing a separate (smaller, lower res monitor) for my mac mini, I decided this was worth the try. I read in one of the many reviews I went through to use this device with a powered USB hub and not the one of the macs USB ports. Well when I first booted up my brand new mac mini, I had this adapter plugged into a power USB hub and every few seconds or so it would flicker with colors static on a regular interval. Obviously this wasnt gonna fly, so I ran a USB extension cable from the USB cable on the adapter to a [[ASIN:B000QFKDJ2 Music Power 0900-70 Solo USB AC Adapter/Charger]] USB AC power adapter (can get them for $9 on amazon) and it began working perfectly! I have had it running a few days now and have spend hours on it with no hiccups. The only issue Ive had happen once was one time after coming out of sleep mode the video was all messed with vertical banding lines of static, but a restart of the mac cleared it up. It sucks that we have to deal with ANY issues at all after paying so much for a silly little adapter from a company that markets so heavily no problems, but giving up the resolution my Samsung 305T 30\\" lcd yields was not about to happen. Especially since I bought the Mac Mini exclusively for development where large screen real estate is a must.
B000HWXS2S|5.0|If you are looking for brutal, yet melodic death metal that centers around Viking imagery, myth and history...look no further.     This is by far Amon Amarth's best effort.  As if the music alone was not reason enough to buy this CD, the storyline will give you goose bumps.    Lets face it, I am not going to pretend that I can write a good review to save my life, but what I am going to do is to put this CD into perspective for you.    Metallica has \\"Ride the Lightning\\", Slayer has \\"Reign In Blood\\" and Amon Amarth has \\"With Oden on Our Side\\".    I lost part of my hearing to this CD...No Lie. Now that's metal.

1400079276|2.0|Interesting moments, and a unique though at times very predictable plot line, this book feels solidly in the teen lit genre.  This is the first Murakami novel I've read. While it piqued my interest, I won't be rushing off to read another.  I don't know whether it suffers from rotten translation, or the problems originate with Murakami himself. Surely the incessant product name dropping is Murakami's doing (by the 7th mention, I'd pretty well gotten the point that Ms Saeki uses a Mont Blanc pen . . . and I really don't need a label-by-label description of Oshima's wardrobe#.  However, I don't know what to do with the mess on page 452 #\\"No matter how fiercely he attacked it, the thing kept on creeping out of Nakata's mouth, nonplussed.\\").  I'm the only one nonplussed here.  If this is the translator's gaff, they've no business in that line of work. If it's Murakami's mistake, then he needs a brush up on basic vocabulary. Or do I look to the editors?  I don't know.  All in all, this was an acceptable read, but nothing remotely approaching the brilliance of earlier Japanese writers - or western writers - or African writers - or . . . .  If you're older than 20 and want engaging, lyrical, thought-provoking writing, pick up a Mishima novel you've not read before.  This is a fine teen novel.
0312427999|2.0|Naomi Klein wants to shock. Shock sells. If shock is the means by which what she calls \\"Disaster Capitalism\\" achieves its aims, why shouldn't it be hers as well? The prime example is her 6 minutes horror film on YouTube advertising her book. Watch this and spare youself suffering through 500plus pages. Here's her recipe: Make up a thrilling headline, take a number of events in contempary history, add two dozen quotes taken out of context, a half-baked conspiracy theory, dress yourself to kill, give the left a much needed sex appeal, put it all into a blender and - voila! - you're an overnite sensation selling millions of books.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|I'll be pithy:<br /><br />Great audio quality - DTS-HD in 5.1 Master Audio.  AVC 1080p on ten 50GB Blu-rays, with consistently impressive video quality throughout.  Beautiful yet simple packaging.<br /><br />Enable the 'All Roads Lead To Rome' option to experience trivia on many specific sections of each episode (it disables subtitles when turned on).  Well worth it to read details on ancient Rome and the series itself.  While artistic freedom has been added to some of the historical details for the sake of the story, the writers, directors, and producers have certainly excelled at capturing authenticity enough to at least equal some historical shows viewed on The History Channel.<br /><br />Great casting and acting.  Phenomenal production values.  In the end it's truly impressive.  If I had to give it a grade, it'd earn a 90% overall.<br /><br />[While living in Italy, I purposely seeked out the Cinecitt&agrave; studios outside of Rome where much of this was filmed - it had that much of an impression, I guess.]
B001AQR3E4|3.0|Great movie. This quality of the blu-ray was not really great. It's ok. Maybe older movies should not be made into blu-ray.
B00005JMUA|3.0|Kill Bill 2 was an OKAY movie at best. It lacks the tremendous impact of KB1 (Kill Bill Volume 1). It's more appropriate to say it is the KB1 supplement. It tells the history of the assassins, at least how they were trained. However, the movie makes very little sense. The main star gets shot and it doesn't make sense why he used rock salt instead of bullets. I thought THAT was ridiculous. Stuff like that. I also thought it played too much importance with David Carradine, former star of Kung Fu and I thought this movie sought to imitate those old shows, even with \\"Bill\\" playing that stupid flute and reciting Kung Fu quips of wisdom-so that turned me off and I thought it was a kind of imitation of the old Kung Fu shows. There were a few awesome fight scenes, but lacked the spectacular qualities of the first movie. I was disappointed. I thought it was an okay movie, but it really was a supplemental, and David Carradine wasn't that great in it either. They really should have used another actor-I mean he looked too old, too tired. And his acting was mediocre at best.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|First off, if you are expecting some special tracks from this album you may be disappointed.  Disc 2 contains some unreleased demo material and a poem recitation which is pretty cool ... but most of disc 1 can be found on other albums.  What you DO get with this great little 2 disc set is a hardcover book that serves as the case which highlights pictures from the was-to-be \\"THIS IS IT\\" tour and made it into the filming of \\"THIS IS IT\\".<br /><br />This is a great memento for any Micheal Jackson fan and the price is right!  Please be aware of the track list (available right up at towards the top of the page here) before you buy so that you know beyond a doubt what you are getting.<br /><br />Amazon does a great job of providing track lists and the opportunity to listen to small clips before you buy the entire album.  But even if you were to buy the album just for Disc 2, you have a piece of history and something newly original.<br /><br />I love this little set.  It's great!<br /><br />5 Stars
B000R7GKQE|5.0|The second season of Supernatural picks up right where the first one let's off and doesn't take the foot off the pedal until the epic season finale. Much like the first, the second season of Supernatural has the same format as the first one where each episode there is a new monster of the week based on folklore/myth all the while Sam and Dean try to hunt down the yellow-eyed demon that killed their father. Overall, the second season is superior to the first in just about every way aside from the absence of Jeffrey Dean Morgan (John), although he is in a select few episodes at the beginning and end of the season. The stories in general are better, the video/sound quality is better, and the acting/dialogue is better. Although a few episodes are hit or miss, this season of Supernatural has a few less duds in it despite being an impressive 22 episodes in length just as the first one was. You can really tell that Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) are beginning to really come into their own as actors throughout the course of the second season. The season finale of season two is just epic and in two episodes beautifully brings the concurrent story through the first two seasons to a close while opening up a new one for the following season. If you were a fan of the first season then you're going to love the second one.    Story: 10/10  Dialogue: 9/10  Acting: 8/10  Special Effects: 8/10
B001RIYOTM|5.0|I had never before read A Christmas Carol, but have watched countless versions of movies based on it. So when I finally did read it (now in my 40s!), I found it very familiar. It was enjoyable to read in the original 1840s language. I marveled at how innovative Dickens was more than 150 years ago with this very original ghost story.<br />[...]
B000FP2OPY|5.0|With so many shows based on the supernatural passing in and out of existence over the past decade, this is one that stands out. This isn't just a story of a couple of guys going out and hunting and killing things that go bump in the night, this is a story about a family whose lives have been torn apart and are desparately trying to piece them back together. It's about a family and it's bond and the strength of that in the face of all adversity. Though, the fact that they kill ghosts, vampires, werewolves, demi-gods and demons along the way is pretty sweet too. This show is very similar to the X-Files in the sense that it has a main storyline, or mythos, that is sort of an underlying bond that holds the series together. Even though each episode is radically different from the next in terms of story and setting, bits and pieces of the mythos are revealed throughout the season leading toward the climatic season finale. It's also very similar to the X-Files due to the show's Monster of the Week setting where each week the two protaganists, Dean and Sam, face off against a new supernatural horror. While they are doing this, they search desparately for the man they've idolized all of their lives, their father John, who went missing during a \\"hunting\\" trip at the onset of the series. Anybody who's a fan of the X-Files, any classic horror films, or general myth and folklore will really enjoy Supernatural. Quite a few of these legends I remember even hearing as a kid and what's cool is the writers/producers of Supernatural take different aspects of a folklore/myth and kind of combine it into their own unique canon. However, as with any show that has such a long season (22 episodes) there is of course some episodes that are duds but there are none that are flat-out unwatchable and more often than not they're just awesome.

B000ZELISO|1.0|Worst Blu Ray movie that I have seen, perhaps it's because most of the film is dark. Paid $15 for all 3 disks and to tell you the truth got ripped.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|Due to it being shorter than the first two seasons due to the writer's strike, the third season of Supernatural has almost a break-neck pace to it all the way up until the climatic season finale. However, don't think this takes away from the main storyline at all though because in truth it actually enhances it. Due to a shorter season (16 episodes), the writers/producers had to focus on more mythos storyline content per episode and this is a definitive break in the show from the previous two seasons. In seasons one and two, the story revolved on the Monster of the Week motif with the main storyline spread in bits and pieces of several episodes throughout the season leading up to the season finale. As a result of the shortened season however, the third installment of the series all shifts away from the monster of the week settings for each episode and instead focuses on the task at hand; saving Dean from going to hell. The series also has demons playing a more prominent role in the show after the gate to hell is opened at the end of the second season. In essence, different demons often replace the typical monsters of the week. This is not to say that there isn't a few Monster of the Week episodes, but in just about every episode there is something important or pertinent to do with the main story. Also, the dialogue in the third season takes another shift as it becomes much more witty and sometimes comedic. There are quite a few classic Dean and Sam moments throughout this season and the two leads, Jensen and Jared, play them wonderfully. The third season of Supernatural also introduces a new main character in the series; a demon by the name of Ruby whose true motives are unknown but she seems to have taken quite an interest in Sam. Even though the season is grade A quality and right up there with the previous two seasons, it just seems like there's something missing in terms of plot development and depth in regards to the story. It almost feels as if the third seasonof Supernatural is sort of a transitional phase for the show, not just because of it's shorter season but the general change in episode format. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great story but it just doesn't have that epic feel to it that the first two seasons did but I will say the season finale is right up there with the best of them. Although season three marks the beginning of a shift in the series, it's still Supernatural none the less and if you enjoyed the first two seasons then there's no way you'll be disappointed with the third.

B001AQR39O|5.0|This past year, David checked into a rehab facility for \\"Sexual Addiction\\".      Wait, he plays that character in his series!    Buy this used.  There might not be a Season Three if they don't release him.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|The fourth season of Supernatural is, well, just awesome. In my own opinion, it is the best season in terms of story, dialogue, acting, and visuals. The season begins months after the third one ended with Dean going to hell and brings an entirely new dimension to the show; angels. Over the first three seasons, viewers are witness to dozens of supernatural horrors from ghosts, vampires, werewolves, demi-gods, witches, demons, etc. but for the first time ever in the series they finally see something in the show that's actually not out for Sam and Dean's head. It's really refreshing in a sense to see something good out there in what appears to be a sea of evil in the show. However, as the season progresses and without giving too much away it appears that few things are black and white and as is the case with Supernatural they're much more grey in the end. The fourth season is a full 22 episodes in length and just as the previous third season began to break away from the Monster of the Week format, the fourth season follows suit with every single episode containing some new development in the main storyline or mythos of the series building up to what appears to be the inevitable; the apocalypse. The story and dialogue of the fourth season are unmatched in terms of quality and Jensen (Dean) and Jared (Sam) really knock the acting out of the ballpark while Mischa Collins (Castiel) and Genevieve Cortese (Ruby) provide great supporting roles. Although season four fills out the definitive shift in the series that began in season three, if you're a fan of Supernautral you cannot possibly be disappointed by season four of the series and it's a must have not just for any Supernatural fan but any fan of flat-out good film. What are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and order it already.    Story: 10/10  Dialogue: 10/10  Acting: 10/10  Special Effects: 10/10
B0000714BP|2.0|I love this movie- I think it is one of the sweetest movies ever. So when I decided that I needed a DVD after my old video finally croaked I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon. Unfortunately several scenes have been cut on the DVD including my favorite one, where Patrick Swayze's character delivers a much deserved thrashing to an abusive husband. The scene is about half the length it is on my old video & a couple of others are shortened as well. This is a wonderful movie & I hope to find an uncut one on DVD somewhere.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I'm going to make this short. the album is epic. I've been a fan of 30 seconds to mars for years. I've seen them live twice and can't wait to see them again when they are on tour for this cd. It is different from other albums, but that's not a bad thing! I can listen to it over and over again. I love how they involved the fans so that when they are live the fans have their own part to contribute! Night of the hunter and hurricane are probably my favorite songs on there. they are very different, but amazing! this is well worth the money and wait! these boys never disappoint
B0026P3G12|5.0|I BOUGHT IT AS A CHRISTMAS PRESENT I WILL NOT KNOW UNTIL THEN BUT ITS GREAT I'M SURE.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|The series had some excellent writing and all the actors did a formidable job of being consistent and improving.  The DVD set makes it easier to follow the continuing plots and story lines and gives the satisfaction of not having commercial interruption and having to \\"stay tuned for next week\\".  Another advantage of having the series in a compressed time line is watching the characters evolve. And with the DVD it is fun to catch the occasional mistake that Editing overlooked (dialog between Ensign Merriwether and his mother in the cafeteria of the family freighter, mis-named the ship).<br />This series answered questions by laying background for the other Star Trek series and also cleverly inserted tid-bits relating to events yet to come.  The viewer learns how relationships with other species evolved and how the roots of the Federation were established while many new plot lines were explored.<br />My only negative was obtaining a used copy.  Although \\"checked\\", it was not fault free having at least two episodes damaged significantly on the DVD making them impossible to view in their entirety. Otherwise, I feel this series is well worth the time and price for those who are Star Trek and Sci-Fi fans.
B00008GKEG|5.0|At over eight hours, this documentary is likely be tiresome to all but the most hardcore fans but, if you count yourself among the latter group, a splendid time is guaranteed by all. After part one, which covers the lads from Liverpool from birth up to 1962, each successive episode covers approximately a year in the lives and careers of the Fab Four. There's plenty of time for extensive performance footage, including all their Ed Sullivan show appearances, the Royal Variety Performance, much of the Shea Stadium appearance, and even the rather crappy Budokan shows. It's all here, interspersed with extensive interview footage with all the principals. What I learned is: after manager Brian Epstein died in 1967, the Beatles sort of lost their way, lost their reliable arbiter of good judgment and taste, and fell into such misbegotten projects as their Apple boutique and the Get Back/Let It Be film project. I also realised that I don't have a favourite Beatle. George comes off as sort of an old crank, Paul and John as massive egos, and, well, Ringo is just Ringo, a pleasant sort with a nice touch on the drums and an unshakable backbeat. In their characters, there simply wasn't anything all that special about these guys, but they each had a sort of imperfect musical talent. When they combined those talents, however, some kind of magical mystery took place, and they created art for the ages. So, my favourite Beatle is The Beatles, all four of them working together. Which makes me realise that the one thing missing from this extensive documentary is any mention of their solo careers. There's no Plastic Ono Band, no All Things Must Pass, no McCartney (the album) even mentioned here, which seems odd in a way, considering how exhaustive this documentary project purports to be. Yoko Ono's notorious role in driving a wedge between the members of the band is also sloughed over rather quickly at the end of episode seven. Her participation was perhaps necessary to getting access toall the interviews that John gave after the Beatles broke up, and to the successful production of this film. So, the filmmakers are nice to her. But, just her presence, sitting there like a fifth wheel in the studio during the recordings of The White Album and Let It Be speaks for itself. She's darned annoying. If Epstein had lived, he'd probably have said to John that you can't take your wife to the office.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|It's nice to have these freebie classics. Especially when I don't want to pop for a kindle, just the iPhone app.
B0025KVLTC|5.0|While Rubber Soul had a better batch of songs -- and I have to confess a personal affection for the overlooked Beatles For Sale album, the Fab Four's moody, country-rock mini-masterpiece -- Revolver has always seemed to me like the Beatles' greatest record overall, a fine batch of songs married to a highly creative production and their first hard-edged rock-n-roll sound that began to look far into the future instead of back to the past of Carl Perkins and Little Richard. In short, as the best album by rock's greatest band, Revolver deserves six stars, not merely five. Which made me approach the 2009 remaster with particular interest. Is there a difference? You betcha! Right from the cough on the opening count-in to \\"Taxman\\", which now sounds like somebody's in your room with you coughing. My wife was actually spooked when I put it on. The rest of the album also has this extra level of sonic detail that somehow makes all of the music seem less tense, more relaxed. For the first time in digital, it sounds truly unforced and natural. A great record gets a little greater.

B001KVZ6FW|2.0|Personally, I loved \\"UP.\\"  I thought it was a meaningful, beautiful movie.  My husband and myself especially loved the dogs!<br /><br />HOWEVER, it was marketed as a kid's movie.  Like, Shrek, just because something is animated does not a children's movie make!  My children are 8, 6, and 3.  I may consider letting them see it around 10 years old.<br /><br />Problems:<br />The long lost hero turns villain.  And, a really bad one at that.  He actually tries to murder a child, unacceptable!<br /><br />The opening montage... beautiful.  BUT, a sensitive child will be very saddened by it.<br /><br />The boy's father *never* shows up.  I don't care if that is reality for 50% of kids out there, mine don't need to be \\"educated\\" about that possibility.
0684833395|5.0|I first read Catch-22 in high school, and ever since have held it to be my all-time favorite book. So it was with some trepidation that I cracked it back open as an adult. Would it hold up? Thankfully, it did more than hold up; it turns out that it's even better than I remember. It's not just Heller's brilliant, through the looking glass logic that makes Catch-22 so remarkable, even though that logic leads to innumerable laugh-out-loud hilarious passages and too many brilliant sequences to count (my personal favorite may always be the sudden moaning outbreak). Had the book merely been a brilliant and hilarious piece of satire, I would have enjoyed it, but it wouldn't be the classic that it is. What makes Catch-22 absolutely unforgettable is the deep layer of melancholy and rage that underlies the satire and drives the book. I've always held that one of the hardest things to do in any medium is mix genres, and I'm always impressed when someone does it well. In Catch-22, Heller mixes drama, comedy, romance, and war story together without even blinking, and slides so effortlessly between them that you go from laughing to horror in the blink of an eye. It's this juxtapositioning that gives the book so much of its power - the transition, for instance, from Yossarian's insane arguing with Danby to the horrific fate of poor, doomed Snowden remains one of the most effective and haunting passages of any book I have ever read. There has never been another book like Catch-22 - even Heller never wrote anything this brilliant again (although Something Happened is a minor gem of an altogether different sort). But given how incredible this book is - how funny, how touching, how haunting, how powerful, how brilliant - who can complain? With its spectacular and wonderful set of characters, its trenchant and hilarious take on the military mind, and Heller's masterful writing, Catch-22 remains the finest book I have ever read.
B002VECM6I|5.0|When Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), a wealthy Memphis wife and mother meets homeless teen Mike Oher (Quinton Aaron), she takes him home as one of the family.<br /><br />The movie, based on a true story, is fairly predictable as it heads toward its happy and tear-jerking ending, but it's told so well that it's never corny or maudlin.  The traumas Mike endured early in life are alluded to rather than graphically shown, and one is left with overwhelming admiration for him and the Tuohy family.  Sandra Bullock is great as the feisty Leigh Anne and singer Tim McGraw is very likeable as her husband.  Quinton Aaron is excellent as the abandoned child who went on to graduate from college and play professional football.  Many real-life college football coaches play themselves as Mike is wooed by all the top schools.  Highly recommended.
0553381695|2.0|Let's be honest, if CoK was the first book, this series would never have taken off. Game of Thrones is great, CoK, not so much.     CoK actually points out the inherent weakness of Thrones -- a poor choice of POV characters. I can stand the boring characters for a single book, but the weakness starts to become a real problem in 900-page book 2.    1) Most of the characters are boring beyond belief. Caetlyn is a 21st century Oprah show castoff (\\"When can I stop being so strong?\\" Oh, pleeze!). Most POV characters are children and women. Most of the interesting action of the story takes place off-screen and then whole chapters are devoted to characters talking to each other about what has happened in the absence of any POV character. Robb should have been a POV character, as he should have been in Thrones. Theon is a waste of space, silly storyline. Jon has great potential but is wasted in going-nowhere storyline.     2) Writing not nearly as crisp as in Thrones. This one needs lots of cutting. A lot of the book can be skipped. Every chapter in Thrones moved the story forward. Not so Clash. The Theon storyline was added for milking purposes only. It becomes obvious that Martin is simply milking it throughout. The story should have been concluded in this book. The plot in Thrones was actually pretty tight. Throw out the dragon lady (put her in a different book somewhere) and you could have a great 2-volume story. As it is, this one's going nowhere fast.    3)After the pathetic Eddard and Robert got killed in Thrones, it seems the entire world is run by teenagers and women. I thought at first that this was Martin acquiescing to his audience, but then he throws in lots of gratuitous very graphic sex. Makes me sort of embarrassed for Martin personally and makes me wonder about the man's character.     Hopefully, things pick up in Storm, but I'm not quite as eager to read on now as I was after Thrones.
B0018M6J90|2.0|The movie opens in London in 1938, as an out-of-work nanny (Frances McDormand) finagles her way into a job interview as social secretary to a would-be actress (Amy Adams), and spends the next 24 hours caught up in her world of show biz glamour and chaotic romances.<br /><br />This movie tries to recreate the madcap, screwball comedies of the thirties that starred the likes of Carole Lombard, Irene Dunne, and Claudette Colbert, but fails miserably.  Amy Adams, as the harebrained young actress, overacts horribly and is neither likeable nor sympathetic, still looking like the gauche hayseed she played in [[ASIN:B000BYRCQU Junebug]].  Frances McDormand is very good as the down-trodden title character, but the script is corny with a ridiculous fairy tale-ending, and dashing Ciaran Hinds is wasted as her lingerie-designer Prince Charming.  Shirley Henderson tries to be a villain but with her [[ASIN:B000W746GK Moaning Myrle]] voice, she can't pull it off.<br /><br />The movie never captures the feel of the thirties and would have been better filmed in black and white and with a more subtle actress like Emily Watson instead of Miss Adams.  Not recommended.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I missed having these songs and this just suppressed the hunger. And it was nice to be introduced to three songs I'd never heard before. Good stuff!
B001OQCV24|1.0|This film is litterally a two hour run from earthqakes, falling skyscrapes, giant fireballs and whatnot chasing you two meters behind, with characters that always manage to escape in the last second before the bridge colapse, jump over the earthquake crack in the last second, even manage to take of in a plane with planet earth crumbling behind them in the last possible moment.. VERY original.. We've all seen special effects so special they can't possibly get any more special. Just making more buildings collapse at the same time than in the last movie won't make anyone rise from his seat screaming \\"Finally 16 buildings collapsing simultaneously! Oh man, how I've waited for someone to breach the 15-mark!\\". When did making special effects for the sake of having special effects in a movie ever make a GOOD movie? Hardly ever. Hopefully this garbage will end the hunt for the movie with the most stunning special effects, since they just threw in everything there is in this one. What will come next? A family being chased by Mars or Saturn? This has got to stop.     The silly religious undertones are just embarrassing. What was that in the end? Noah's Arc? Geez.. No wonder I didn't buy the story.

1439157383|5.0|My Sister's Keeper is about a thirteen girl named Anna, and her family.  Her fifteen year old sister named Kate has leukemia and was diagnosed around the age of two.  During that time, Kate's parents decided to conceive another child that would have the exact genetic make-up as Kate so that child would be an exact donor match for Kate.  That's what Anna is.  Anna's life has revolved around Kate and her struggle to live, and so far Anna gave everything to Kate that she needed.  At the age of fifteen, Kate came to Anna and asked her to become medically emancipated from her parents so that Kate can die because she doesn't want to live the cancer life anymore and put her family through all the struggles.  Anna then goes to Campbell, the lawyer, and goes through the process of becoming medically emancipated from her parents.      Anna's parents love each other but become distant from each other through the stress of the cancer and Anna's emancipation.  Anna's mom is completely unsympathetic and controlling, and thinks Anna is idiotic for not giving Kate everything she needs.  The family has a son who is often times forgotten about and hidden because of most attention going to Kate.  He struggles with who he is and throughout the book causes problematic troubles of his own.    This novel grabs the reader by the heart.  It keeps you interested because each chapter is told from a different family member's point of view.  The novel is a bit long, but over all the detil the author uses makes you feel like your a family member living in their life.  Not only does it cause one to feel the pains and struggles of a family, but one feels the sorrow of a pre-teen trying to do what's right.  This novel is a must read, and challenges the basis of how humans live their lives.

0307473708|4.0|Being a huge fan of the Showtime series, I just HAD to read the book! And having seen the first season of Dexter, I had an inkling of how Darkly Dreaming Dexter was going to end. But what a shocker! I won't give away any spoilers here, but I was pleased with both the similarities and the differences between the book and first season. After all, if they had both been exactly the same it would have been quite boring.<br /><br />The book is written in first person from Dexter's point of view; and if you've ever seen the series and heard Dexter's narratives (and what he thinks of us humans), then you can imagine what an entire book of his narratives would read like. We don't learn much about the other characters and their lives, except what Dexter cares to know about them himself (which isn't much). It made the book a very quick, easy, and fun read.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who has or hasn't seen the series. Though if you have, embrace the differences.
B000XUHWO4|5.0|I used to be in the music business before I went into journalism, and I have to say that I must have listened to this seminal recording more than 50 times in the last 20 years and never tired of its great beauty. In my opinion, it's one of the 20th century greats...
B000VNMMQG|4.0|A poignant reminder for today's world of the horrors of the global slave trade of centuries past and the bravery of those who dared to stand against the trade no matter the consequences.  The acting is superb on all accounts.  The story - whether it's historically correct or has been subjected to artistic license - is still inspirational as Britain's William Wilberforce stood as the leader of the abolitionist movement and against all odds of success at a time when slavery was the lifeblood of the economy.  My only mild criticism is that the movie dragged a little through some parts and could probably have been shortened just a tad.  Nevertheless, it's a good one.
1401923119|2.0|I've started trying to learn all that I can on the subconscious mind in an attempt to live to my fullest potential.  So far, I haven't found the \\"ah ha!\\" book that has done the trick for me.  A few chapters into The Biology of Belief:  Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, and Miracles, I really thought I had finally found \\"the\\" book!<br /><br />The author has a very strong biology background and has made some interesting discoveries on how cells \\"think\\".  He ties that in to how colonies of cells are more efficient than single cells and made good arguments in my opinion on how that resulted in the first multi-celled organisms many billions of years ago.  I haven't dwelled on it TOO much, but I've always struggled mentally with how the shift from single celled organisms to a living breathing animal could have occurred...  I mean what would have prompted a bunch of cells to band together and decide that they would be better off if some of them became a specialized tissue or an organ like a lung? :)  This book lifted that fog for me, so I was really entrenched then.<br /><br />I'm a \\"computer guy\\" by profession.  In one section, the author started building up one of his eureka moments where he came up with a description of cellular structures that was identical to that of a microprocessor chip.  I was very interested to see where this would lead.<br /><br />Then he started throwing in the words \\"quantum physics\\".  I love reading about quantum physics.  I don't claim to understand much of it, but I am truly fascinated by it and I started setting myself up to hear the author's opinion on how cells might communicate with the subconscious via a quantum physics mechanism rather than being confined to those of classical Newtonian methods.<br /><br />So at this point, I can't put the book down.  I'm honestly not much of a reader (although I've been getting better about that lately), but I was going full speed on this book.  I got to chapter 7, and I thought it was kind of a random tangent to the rest of the book.  It was all about DNA selection/masking in the prenatal and early infant stages of life with an overtone of how to be a good parent during this time.  It was interesting, but I'm not a parent so I was ready to get on to the parts that were relevant to me!<br /><br />Chapter 7 was definitely a turning point in the book though, so I thought we were just starting to get into the \\"Unleashing\\" part that the subtitle promised.  I purchased the Kindle version of this book for my iPhone, and if you're flipping through and focused on the book, you don't have any concept of how far along you are in the book as a whole.  So I got to the end of chapter 7 and flipped to the next page, and.......  That was the end of the book!  @#%!@  I couldn't believe it!<br /><br />There was no interesting connections made on his viewpoints of why a cell is like a microprocessor, the quantum physics never got any deeper than implying that biology and medicine today are still deeply entrenched in Newtonian physics, but most disappointing of all was that there was definitely no \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter, and Miracles\\".  For that matter, there really wasn't any \\"Biology of Belief\\".  It was truly an interesting and well written book on biology and how cells communicate.  There really was nothing regarding the subconscious mind.  The author made a point several times to show how he wasn't exactly mainstream in his biology field, so I was let down by the fact that he stopped so abruptly and didn't tie all of this together (even if it was a wild opinion on his part).<br /><br />I was even more let down that there was no section whatsoever on his thoughts on how we can use anything in his book to make changes in our lives.  I finally flipped a little further past the epilog and found an addendum where he comes right out and says that when he does lectures on this topic, his audience is pretty much left with the same feeling of \\"Ok, that was interesting, but where's the good stuff?!  How do we do something about it!?\\"  His answer is directing them to his partner Robert Williams who does seminars on his \\"PSYCH-K\\" technique.  If you look that up, you'll see that they cross-reference one another and push each other's products.  The author even touts PSYCH-K as a cure-all because that is what motivated him to finish this book.  To me, that's an argument against it because I felt very strongly that this book was not finished and he just got tired of doing it and slapped an ending on it.<br /><br />If you're looking for an interesting read on cellular biology, I have absolutely no problem recommending this book.  If you are like me and were drawn here by the title that implies that you will gain useful self-help knowledge, keep shopping.  Biology books don't sell as good as self-help books I'm guessing.  :)<br /><br />If any of you have suggestions on books that you think would have been more in line with what I was looking for, please comment!ow do we do something about it!?\\"  His answer is directing them to his partner Robert Williams who does seminars on his \\"PSYCH-K\\" technique.

Biology books don't sell as good as self-help books I'm guessing.  :)    If any of you have suggestions on books that you think would have been more in line with what I was looking for, please comment!
0316166685|3.0|Liked the author's writing...the story is sad but gripping enough to bring you into the story and want some closure! Unfortunately, the ending really doesn't give what we need as readers. There are some weird parts about heaven and then the strange sex scebe chapter.... that really through me off but if that was edited out of the book it would be a 4star book.<br /><br />There is some profanity, ghost possession sex, and the violent rape/murder discribed.

B000TGJ80S|4.0|The movie was good, a diifrent kind of dracula. I recevied product in a timely manner, would purchase from this buyer again
B00000K3CM|5.0|This is a great movie for anyone of any age!  I would just like to say that if you read the Amazon review by Tom Keogh, do not be turned off to the movie.  Mr. Keogh does not seem to appreciate the film for what it is.  So give it a shot it is worth it!
0060594896|5.0|This book has it all. I have read Wayne Dyer, my first encounter with positive thinking, Zig Ziglar, Michael Gerber (E-myth revisted), Robert Kiyosaki, etc. and this book is a vital piece of the puzzle. Kudo's to Amazon for offering used books at a cheap price, so I can afford to read more.
0060512806|1.0|To start with the end. It just ends!   The flipping/cycling between time and characters and writing so much unnecessary details to fill pages after pages about the settings the characters moving through are very annoying to say the least. It is like writing about the computer has 45 chips of the dimension of 1 inch each connected with green wires to another pcb board to make an 256 Kbit multi channel i/o port to induce an open channel for full duplex handshaking protocols according to the ieee convention drafted in Paris in 1984 during the time that the president was evicted for drugs trafficking. And then nowhere in sight of the story this information comes back or is needed or adds anything to the content of the story. Pages after pages. After reading i remembered another book i recently bought and read and was also very disappointed. I just looked it up in my library and it was the same author writing snow crash. Both books are highly (marketing hype) talked of but to me its as bad as it can get. It is a shame that it is even an New york Times Notable book. Just bought hype marketing to put on the book to push sales. Also on his snowcrash book is an positive quote of New York Times. Snowcrash was also so bad pathetic written unbelievable childish contetn. I will no longer buy any of his bad books nor take the New York times as an credible source of finding good books. My above opinion is personal as the same goes for certain food you like to eat or not the same goes with reading books.

B001R4KQDE|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies of all time. Very action oriented with a dark grimy feel to it. This directors cut version includes both the \\"regular cut\\" and the unrated cut,(which has a few extra scenes)each on thier own seperate BRDVD. Comes packed with extras! One of the extras is a mini video game. You use your Bluray remote to play the game. So fun. By far this is one of the most visually impressive movies ever! No joke. If you are like me and just jumped on the High Def bandwagon, this is THE movie you want to show off your TV's awsomeness! Almost looks 3d. Overall this is a movie worth owning. 10+/10 stars
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|ALMOST $50.00??? What? I live in the overpriced capital of the world... Honolulu and can buy this toy for the small price of $12.00 at Toys R Us or $17.00 at the newly opened lego store. Do yourself a favor and drive out to the store and buy it or call a family member and ask them to ship it to you. You can even offer them $20.00 for the deed and get it cheaper. Dear God what is wrong with this seller.
B001E1GXPA|5.0|Trivium's most recent album, \\"Shogun\\", shows us how the band is continually developing as musicians and songwriters. Their first two albums were in the metalcore vein, whereas \\"The Crusade\\" took things into thrash metal. So how does \\"Shogun\\" measure up to their first three albums? Read on to find out.    I would define the sound of \\"Shogun\\" as being a cross between the sound on the first two albums paired up with \\"The Crusade\\", and to boot, a vast, epic-sounding element that shows Trivium entering a new realm. Matt's screams are back on \\"Shogun\\", and here, he sounds more vicious and mighty than ever. However, I would hardly call \\"Shogun\\" a metalcore album, as the intensity and honest sound would make any of the bands with sentence-long names run for cover! The songs on \\"Shogun\\" are able to combine brutality with pure beauty on a larger-than-life scale, making this a truly unique album.    \\"Kirisute Gomen\\" starts off with some slow acoustic guitars before going into a complex and catchy drumline. The rest of the band builds up until the song is fully kickin', starting things off on a fast and intense thrash-metal note. Matt's ferocious screams bring the pre-chorus through. The chorus is slower and more melodic, reminiscent of the Metallica masterpiece \\"Orion\\". And the solos? Intense as ever! The band really gets things off with a bang on this first song.    \\"Torn Between Scylla and Charybdis\\" is a personal favorite of mine, opening with a hammer-on riff on the high B-string. The verses are in 6/8, giving the song a swaying feel to it, before going into a brutal, scream-driven pre-chorus and a beautiful, slower chorus. This song can definitely be described as \\"epic\\".    \\"Down From The Sky\\" keeps the consistency of brilliance going, with a slow and beautifully majestic opening, before breaking into a more uptempo feel. This song has such a great, huge-sounding vibe and powerful feel to it, what a song!    \\"Into The Mouth of Hell We March\\" is yet another powerful anthemthat has one of my favorite choruses on the album and adds to the shape of the sound on the album. More amazing musicianship as always, too.    I can see \\"Throes of Peridition\\" as being a huge moshpit song at live shows, with its energetic guitar and drumwork throughout. It also manages to keep the same sense of epic melody as the first four songs, maintaining a consistency.    \\"Of Prometheus and the Crucifix\\" is in the key of A-major, and melodically, may be comparable to post-hardcore bands, BUT this song is, of course, much better than those bands, because it still contains the energy and passion that Trivium brings to each song.    \\"Like Callisto to a Star in Heaven\\" has my favorite title on the album, and it reflects the mysterious, epic vibe this song produces. Another great song with more great instrumentation.    \\"Shogun\\" closes off the original album, and is over 11 minutes long. This song is comparable to the title track off \\"The Crusade\\", except with vocals. There's a soft, melodic section here that lasts two-and-a-half minutes, and it really showcases the element of this album's sound. What else is there, you may ask? Oh yes, a blazing-as-ever high-energy guitar solo after that! With a melodic but still powerful section fading out, this epic comes to a close.    The deluxe edition also comes with three bonus tracks, but ironically the band states in the making-of on the 2nd disc, they spent so much energy in making the original album, they didn't think much towards the bonus songs. However, there is a passionate and intense cover of Iron Maiden's \\"Iron Maiden\\". \\"Upon The Shores\\" is an interesting and unusual song for two reasons: Firstly, it's the first Trivium song that shows Matt performing straight-up death metal vocals in one section, but even more surprisingly, directly after that, the band goes into a slow, mournful-sounding, ballad-styled chorus! A strange contrast indeed, but it makes for some new territory explored.    On the second disc, we get a 50-minute making-of, which is at the same time funny, highly entertaining and really informative. It's amazing that the band is as professional as they are in writing songs and understanding what they're doing, especially considering none of them are even 30 yet. There's also a part on the DVD that shows the riffs for guitarists and bassists, which proved to be a treat for me!    Overall, this might just be Trivium's best album to date, it's all a matter of opinion, really. However, I'm really excited for their next album and I seriously hope they continue in this direction, because \\"Shogun\\" is groundbreaking and innovative for modern metal bands, and for everybody interested, as well. Very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0060935464|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic, inspirational story that changes in meaning every time you read it. The story is told from the perspective of \\"Scout\\". She is a young tomboy that lives with her dad, Atticus Finch, and her older brother, Jem. Atticus is a lawer that was just assigned one of the most important case of his life. He is to defend a Black man who was accused of beating and raping a white girl, in a time of racial prejudice. Another important component is a mysterious neighbor that never leaves his house, known as Boo Radley.       I really enjoyed the book though at times it was a little upsetting. It was not like a lot of books where you can tell what is going to happen at the end of the book before it actually happens. Harper Lee keeps it interesting by throwing unexpected events in the story that keep you guessing till the very end.
B00005JLEX|5.0|\\"Seinfeld Seasons 1 and 2\\" shows us the beginning of one of the greatest shows of all time. In this collection, we get the entire first and second season, alongside hours of extra features. Although I personally felt that they defined themselves by the third season, the first two contain some great episodes, as well.    \\"Male Unbonding\\" takes the hilarious true-to-life concept of having a \\"friend\\" that's obsessed with Jerry, yet Jerry doesn't want to be with him, so he makes up excuses that become more and more ridiculous. It also holds the honor of being the only episode that doesn't begin with \\"The\\".  \\"The Statue\\" contains the first scene that really defines Kramer's character, where he goes undercover as a cop in order to get Jerry's statue back. (\\"Keep makin' love to that wall, pervert!\\")  \\"The Heart Attack\\" features George at his funniest, as they go to a holistic healer who, judging by his persona and house, is somebody only Kramer could know! The episode includes a hysterically funny ambulence scene towards the end, definitely one to watch.  \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\" is a classic example of making an entire show out of practically nothing; in this case, waiting around for a seat at a Chinese restaurant. This is a first-rate example of how Seinfeld was always good at taking a minimalistic idea and stretching it into something interesting.  \\"The Busboy\\" is an interesting episode because it ends with the two stories meeting up at the end, something that would be done in plenty of future episodes. It was also quite funny to see Kramer as clumsy as he was in the busboy's apartment, that's our Kramer!  For those who don't own this but want a dosage of Seinfeld, this comes very highly recommended, equally so for those wanting to get into the Seinfeld series. With over 20 episodes, over 13 hours of extra features, including deleted scenes and inside looks on the episodes (something I really love) and a few hidden \\"Easter Egg\\" special features, this collection is sureto satisfy! Pick it up as soon as possible. Thanks for the time, and peace.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|Considering I already reviews all four of the \\"Tremors\\" movies seperately, I'll keep this review short. The \\"Tremors Attack Pack\\" is the collection that I got the four movies from, and believe me, it's the best way to go. All four movies, plenty of extra features, packaging that isn't overly-bulky, and the price is great. If you're a fan of the \\"Tremors\\" series or want to get into a great monster-horror/comedy, this is the best way to do it! Very highly recommended. Thanks for the time, and peace.

It's a great family movie!

B000000H4A|5.0|When I first heard King was putting out a solo record I cringed. Thinking back to the days when my then favorite band, Kiss, put out solo records, I reluctantly bought and listened to it hoping it wouldn't be a massive disappointment. I was very wrong. I was simply amazed at how well King performed many of the instrumentals himself. As usual the vocals were spectacular. King would later put together a band to do his solo records and many of the records were very good, Abigail being the best. If you like King and want to hear his best solo stuff start with this record and then get Abigail you will be very happy you did as they are two of his best.

B001PB3RU8|4.0|UK-indie band Florence + the Machine seemingly came out of nowhere last year and instantly created a major buzz in the indie-community on the strength of a couple of early stand-out tracks in 2008. Now comes the highly anticipated debut album. Musically, Florence + the Machine reminds me of Amy Winehouse and Fiona Apple, just to mention those.<br /><br />\\"Lungs\\" (13 tracks; 46 min.) starts over with a rousing, joyous \\"Dog Days Are Over\\", what a great way to start off the album. \\"Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) (2nd UK single) follows, and it's another bolstrous song, brimming with energy. \\"I'm Not Calling You a Liar\\" is a slower song, with plenty of biting lyrics. The title alone of \\"Kiss With a Fist\\" (1st UK single) will give you a idea of the song, and it's easy to see why this track created an immediate buzz. \\"Drumming Song\\" (3rd UK single) features plenty of, well, drumming, and is bound to bring even all of the shy wallflowers to the dance floor. Good tracks follow one after another, in fact, I really can't pinpoint any weak tracks as such. It all leads up to the album's closer, \\"You've Got the Love\\" (UK 4th single), which summarizes the album perfectly.<br /><br />Wow, what an impressive debut album, highly recommended and sure to end in my 'best of' list for 2009. I can't wait to hopefully catch this band in concert soon (are you reading this, Coachella organizers?). Finally, if you wonder where you can hear Florence + the Machine, check out WOXY (BAM! The Future of Rock and Roll), the internet-only station that brings the bet indie-music in the country, bar none, and where tracks from this album have been played heavily for months now.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|I can recall one of the authors of Star Trek novels advising reader wannabes that if they want to write, don't jump on board the existing Star Trek thing--if you're going to write a story, also create the concept. That struck me initially as a \\"this turf is taken, get yourself your own\\" type of exclusivism. And I found myself resenting the disparaging reference to the first Star Trek feature film as \\"Star Trek: the Slow Motion Picture\\" as coming from the audience that would have done better sticking with Ah-nold, Vin Diesel or ID-2 and other videogame-oriented \\"adventures\\" like that. So with the realization that today's filmmaking is really aimed at meth heads or those intimidated into emulating them, I tried to take this film on its own merits. You know, like people who like to find fault with others but approach what they themselves believe in as sacred and criticism of it as blasphemy insist that you do or you're narrow-minded. Guilty of thought-crime in the full Orwellian sense of the term. But come on--the entire crew of the Enterprise as first conceived by Roddenberry weren't all from the same Academy grad class. And Kirk might have been the youngest captain ever in Starfleet, but he wasn't a rookie fresh out of the Academy, having been given the Center Seat as one of the rewards for a specific act of heroism. Is there anybody left who remembers how Captain Pike was in \\"The Menagerie\\"? In such bad shape that he had to use a beeper to say yes or no? And Kirk first-named him like he was a contemporary still with the rank of Captain? In this film, \\"Admiral Pike\\" is at the awards ceremony in a wheelchair but seems pleasant and alert. So by the time of \\"The Menagerie\\" his health has deteriorated and he cops a \\"medical demotion\\"? Call me a purist if you like, but this \\"ancient history\\" I'm using as a yardstick of comparison is still available on DVD in a box set. Captain Kirk as described in Star Trek's \\"history\\" may be a superlative, heroic officer, but the real-life Admiral Nimitz paid some dues as a junior officer. Any kind of writer is supposed to do his homework, especially if \\"archival material\\" is as easily available as Star Trek's is.fe Admiral Nimitz paid some dues as a junior officer.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Dear Susan,  Congratulations on the most beautiful album of 2009!  I hope to see you in concert in the USA in 2010!!  Picking a favorite is difficult as \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is my favorite hymn.  I believe \\"Wild Horses\\" is the song I sing the most in my head.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!!
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|The opening scene in \\"Top Gun\\" is the best way -- bar none -- for showing off a new TV or sound system. With no transition at all, you suddenly find yourself on the deck of a very busy, very dangerous aircraft carrier with very large jets moving around, threatening to blow off, run over, or slice and dice unwary deck crewmen. The driving rock score, mixed with the sounds of aircraft launches, is expertly blended together into a ballet that concludes with a catapult launch of an F-14 Tomcat off the bow. Going from zero to 140 knots in 120 feet is an absolutely ridiculous thing to do with a 20-ton aircraft, but it is something the U.S. Navy does all the time.    Once you have tested your video and sound system in the first couple minutes, a movie breaks out. There is the outcast hero, the femme fatale, the superiors who don't understand the hero, and villains. The villains are a bit different, in that they have supersonic jets, but it is otherwise standard movie fare. But of a very high standard.    The photography alone makes this an amazing movie; even people who hate Tom Cruise or think his role is a bit too juvenile even for a naval aviator won't be able to resist the glorious aerial photography. The film was shot long before HDTV was invented, and it isn't the best showcase for Blu Ray, but that doesn't mean it isn't outstanding and, frequently, glorious.    One important thing to keep in mind: this movie is about the U.S. Navy. Interviewing movie goers two decades ago, a majority thought the film was about the \\"Air Force.\\" No, the Air Force doesn't fly over endless tracks of ocean, doesn't take off from short, moving runways in all weather, and doesn't fly the (now retired) F-14. Naval aviation has its own unique challenges, and \\"Top Gun\\" gives you a simplistic, but thrilling, overview of one of the world's most dangerous professions.

0307454541|4.0|I didn't know what quite to expect with this book when I started since it is different from my regular reads.  But it turned out to be a page turner with multiple stories interwoven into a satisfying thriller.<br />The characters were believably flawed and developed interesting relationships with each other.  There were more than a few surprises.<br />What made this so different was that instead of being set in New York or Chicago, the tale unfolds in Sweden.<br />It is a book I would highly recommend to mystery fans.
0140277447|4.0|In December 1937, the Japanese army swept into Nanjing. Within weeks, (hundreds of?) thousands of Chinese civilians and soldiers were systematically raped, tortured, and murdered. As a history teacher who is half Japanese and living in China, I felt it was essential to better educate myself on this brutal massacre. The Rape of Nanking is at times a very gruesome read, and the pictures are absolutely shocking, but it's an account that is of fundamental importance. Unfortunately many historians have found numerous mistakes in Iris Chang's book. Although some of those mistakes have been corrected in the updated edition, the book has still been a source of controversy. Despite that, I have been made aware of an tragic event that I before knew very little about. Upon completion of the book, my wife and I visited the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall where a bronze statue stands in Iris Chang's honor. She passed away in 2004.
B0017YWG2S|5.0|Although she passed away many years ago, Elis Regina remains adored by lovers of music, especially Brazilian music. At times sad, at times funny, in turn child-like and sophisticated, Elis Regina's interpretive gifts are showcased in this album. Of course, her signature song Aguas do Marco captivates me at each listening. This is a must have for everyone, fan or not.
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I am a professional musician who performs with a renaissance/medieval group, and I hated this album. The singing is atrocious, the choice of musical accompaniment is odd at best, and the interpretation of the songs is moody and depressing. I like to think I know something about traditional music and this album doesn't even qualify.  This album would be a terrific gift for someone who hates everything, especially Christmas.  Fortunately I found it on sale so I only wasted eight dollars on it. I think I'll hang the CD in my garden to keep birds away.
B001QB9H10|1.0|I got two Movie CD's that were \\"Slipped \\" into my order.I don't know why I would have ordered either of them but they ended up on the order request and I was charged for them.

B001E1GXPA|3.0|I got on board with Trivium when Ascendency was released. I quickly downloaded Ember to Inferno and was all about Trivium. I was very dissapointed in The Crusade as it sounded more like a tribute to Metallica (circa 1988) than a Trivium album. Although I did like the single \\"Into the Gates of Hell...\\", I hesitated (an entire year) on purchasing Shogun.<br /><br />My opinion of Shogun is this - it feels like they are pressing. More growling, less singing, seems faster than anything that they've done in the past, technically stunning to the point that it boarders on progressive metal. All of that sounds good, but in execution, the songs just aren't that great.<br /><br />The first 3 tracks are pure shredders. Very fast, little singing and ultra aggressive. The middle of the album settles into familiar territory where you get some of Ascendency type songs and a little bit of the Crusade. The 3 bonus tracks are my favorite tracks on the entire CD, and that's in part because it sounds like they are relaxed and having a good time just shredding. I really don't care about vocal style, but in Heafy's case, I think they are best served when he sings in the Hetfield growl. The attitude and swagger is most evident there. His singing voice is one dimensional and unless your name is Corey Taylor, pretty much everyone's cookie monster vocals sound like...cookie monster. As far as the songs go, they aren't bad, they just aren't great metal songs. For all the technical proficiancy, there is very little groove or riffs that make you stop and take notice.<br /><br />Trivium is still one of my favorite metal bands, but they need to release another album like Ascendency. That is a CD that sounds like they did what THEY wanted to, not what the fans wanted or a record label wanted. Shogun sounds very much like they are trying to please the people that like singing and the people that like thrash. You can never please everyone, but when you are as good as they are, if they just concentrate on writing songs they know are awesome, the rest of us will all line up to buy the next release.they know are awesome, the rest of us will all line up to buy the next release.

B002NPUCP8|5.0|An outstanding cd from beginning to end. Songs 1,3,4,6,7 are more on the rock side and my personal favorites.I may be going deaf listening to this CD over and over with the volume cranked up to MAXX. I cant wait until she comes to town for a concert. If you like Eric Johnson, Santana, Satriani and the Scorpions you will love this CD. It is the return of the lead guitar solo that has been missing for sooo long. She kind of reminds me of either Avril Levine or Kelly Clarkson (since you've been gone) fronting for the Scorpions and playing lead guitar. Check out \\"Now or Never\\" on youTube to see her very first video and you will get a small taste of what is to come.
B000VDDWDS|2.0|I've really tried to like this movie.  In watching it on blu-ray after watching it on DVD, I can truly say that the blu-ray quality is really quite good, with a few poor shots from the original film intact, and the sound is great.  I have several major problems with the movie, all of which I think seriously detract from its quality.  First, the story line really drags on, and the relationship between the French and British combatants is not really developed to the extent that it deserves, as the movie focuses more on the personal relationship of the commander (R. Crowe) and the ship's doctor/naturalist.  There are a lot of minor side plots going on, like suicidal depression, and an inordinate number of surgeries.  The time scale of the pursuit around Cape Horn, like most events in this film, is lost on the viewer.  After a while, the consistently upbeat attitude of the commander is almost maniacal!  Then there is the ununatural but substantial natural history- an unusually large part of this film, as the ship's doctor is portrayed in a Darwinesque fashion, in the Galapagos.  The first strange episode involves the identification of meal worm (Tenebrionidae) larvae as \\"weevils,\\" part of a pun by the commander, but clearly demonstrating the ineptness of his naturalist friend.  This gets worse on the Galapagos, particularly where impossible telescopic views of remote animals are depicted, and the naturalist releases a captured lot of common green iguanas (Iguana iguana), a species that does not occur in the Galapagos Islands.  At least in Gladiator Ridley Scott (whose work I greatly respect) used a European Robin.  Imagine your reaction if he used an American Robin in a Roman battle scene!  Terrence Mallick, in The Thin Red Line, and in The New World, has also focused on natural history, but takes care to accurately depict the local flora and fauna (more than anyone).  Given the emphasis on Natural History in this film, and its obvious cost, care should definitely havebeen taken in this area.  It's either sloppy movie-making, or distain for natural history.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I pre-ordered from Amazon to receive on first day available.  Wasn't really sure what to expect, but took a chance. I'm so glad I did.  The sound is incredible and I've heard new sounds in songs that I've listened to hundreds or thousands of times before.  I would suggest loading all the music onto your computer and then saving the apple for display (looks great) and when you want to listen to maybe on your surround system through your tv if it has usb port( which many now have and many in the future will probably have as well).  I was so impressed that I tried to buy two more for my kids through Amazon on 12-10 and they were out of stock already.  Availability seems to be a problem with only 30k made.  Watch the stem as I've heard reviews of it being apt to break.  I would suggest keeping all packaging to increase collectors value which I believe might be pretty good.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I originally only bought this for the first song on it (G irlfriend) when I saw it at Target.<br /><br />But then I listened to some of the other songs on it, not knowing what to expect, and BOOM; instant Avril fan.<br /><br />Avril's voice explores many themes. From break-ups/jealousy (G irlfriend, I Can Do Better, Everything Back But You) to general sadness (When You're Gone) to being in love (Hot, Contagious) to general happiness (I nnocence).<br /><br />But either way, she always seems to do it in a way that's enjoyable and keeps me pressing replay again and again.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|\\"Ponyo\\"<br />Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (2008)<br />-----------------------------------------<br />I had the great fortune to see this film in a large, modern movie theatre, with a lot of little kids in the audience for a mid-afternoon matinee. It was a marvelous movie, totally \\"age appropriate\\" for the enchanted five- and six-year olds, as well as their appreciative adult attendants. Miyazaki's films can sometimes be a little too weird or sinister for this age group, but this time he managed to temper his dark side a bit and make a film that still celebrates nature and respects its dangerous side, while not also creeping the bejeezus out of little viewers.<br /><br />The film is set by the oceanside, and this wave-washed setting affords Miyazaki many opportunities to evoke the power of the natural world, as well as to frequently overwhelm the viewer's senses. (It was gorgeous and evocative on the big screen; I wonder how much of this will translate to video...) Although some of Miyazaki's older fans may grumble about him babying-down his material, \\"Ponyo\\" is clearly a great film, probably better than naysayers might think, and certainly one of the best films made for small children in the last twenty or thirty years. The character animation is a bit rough, but the backgrounds and overall design of the film are rich, sensual and majestic, and Miyazaki's key themes come through loud and clear. Highly recommended! (Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain children's film reviews)
B0000027F8|5.0|While \\"Faith\\" seemed to be a bit of a segue out of the candy-pop WHAM! days, this second solo album is more George: older, wiser, more in control of the music on his albums and always so honest and willing to talk about unpopular subjects.  There are shades of \\"Faith\\" in the sound but this is much more serious, haunting, and yes, depressing.  It's like nothing I'd ever heard or will hear again. This is truly one of my favorite albums of all time and even people I knew who didn't like George Michael did like this album.  There is no denying true quality.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|this film was so much fun! I definately enjoyed it & would recommend it to anyone. Both the story and the visual effects of the film are beautifully put together - after watching it I was like, \\"this is now one of my favorite disney movies\\" LOL. I love how all the characters all have a personality, especially the prince (usually in a disney movie there isnt much too the prince) but in this film each character really stands out as their own element and it was truly a joy watching them all interact w/ each other. the film will make you laugh and maybe even cry but i wont say why, no spoilers in this review! :)
B0000CEB4V|5.0|in the words of lee iococca- if you can find a better concert dvd- buy it....  quick and simple- an absolute must for any beatle fan.  excellent sound- excellent editing- excellent musicianship-i loved the indian music  you can feel the love  if youre a beatle fan- have some kleenex around-you might need some    would love to see a hi def version issued one day.
B002OFWG7O|4.0|If you are new to the Foo Fighters this is a great way to get familiar with them. For people like me who already have all of these songs the dvd makes this a good deal for the price. The CD is stocked with your standard hits and singles, with the additions of 2 new songs and an acoustic version of Everlong.    I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed with the new songs Wheels and Word Forward. To me they sounded almost like country-rock, which is not a sound I look for from the Foo Fighters. (I detest country music in general) The acoustic version of Everlong is just Dave by himself with his guitar, judging by his voice it sounds like it was recorded a while ago. Not my favorite version of Everlong but it's ok.    The package comes with several pages of random pictures of the band, it's all in black and white and is mildly interesting.    The dvd contains lots of music videos from band presented in chronological order, which is interesting to see the band as they mature sort of. I wish it was organized video by video instead, it plays them all together, although you can select the individual videos like bookmarks from the menu. It was the first time I'd seen any of the videos (I'm not an MTV person...) the highlights for me...    The Everlong video is...odd, not exactly what one would imagine from listening to the song.  The Low video is Dave and Jack Black in a motel room, and is funny in a disturbing kind of way.    I only gave this package 4 stars instead of 5 because they should have filled the CD to capacity instead of leaving blanks space (as others have noted there are plenty of good songs that could have fit in. And more importantly I wish the dvd had more than just videos on it. If it had behind the scenes stuff and band interviews (like the red hot chili peppers dvd) it would have been better.    Overall, you really can't go wrong with the Amazon price though.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Saw the movie at the theatre, and loved it. When it was available on dvd I wanted it for my collection of great, fun movies to watch and share.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movies puts star trek back on the map.  It is a movie that the whole family can enjoy and you dont have to know a thing about Star Trek to follow it.  Great effect and great action sequences.  I really enjoyed the special features of the blue-ray version as well.  Cant go wrong getting this for a Sci-fi fan for the holidays.  2 thumbs up for me.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I think Celine did an excellent job on this album.  It's an album that I've played for my newborn son and it calms him down and sometimes, he'll go right to sleep.  I would definitely recommend this album to mommies to play for their children and eventually pass down to them when they're old enough.  This album is a keepsake.  Beautiful boy is a great song.  Miracle, If I could and Brahms Lullaby are some other favorites.  But honestly, all the songs on this album are nice and easy listening.  Anne Geddes and Celine Dion should be commended for their work on Miracle.
B00006CXSS|4.0|I bought this as a gift for someone... I have not seen the series myself.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|This really is the ultimate \\"The Beatles\\" collector's item. The photos hardly do this item justice. I was expecting a lightweight, hollow aluminum apple, and that's hardly the case. You could hurt someone with this thing. It's solid and heavy. The USB is magnetically \\"tugged\\" gently into its housing. The box is absolutely beautiful. It's a treasure!<br /><br />It's tempting while admiring the object to keep handling it, just don't drop it! The stem is sturdy enough - it really \\"makes\\" the apple, too - but letting this thing drop to roll around is perilous at best.<br /><br />You can browse album artwork and photos while listening to the tracks on the built-in player. The interface is very clean, straightforward and true to the original works.<br /><br />The sound quality is absolutely phenomenal! The subtle, ticklish guitar at the beginning of \\"Honey Pie\\" is new to my ears. The vocals are truly remarkable throughout the \\"albums,\\" every word comes through with perfect clarity.<br /><br />The 24-bit FLACs are far above and beyond anything I've ever heard from any of the previous Beatles' releases. The MP3s sound remarkable, too. Note that burning MP3s from the 16-bit CDs will result in compressed 16-bit material. The most sonically astonishing MP3s can only be found on The Beatles Stereo USB - these files are compressed from the source material.<br /><br />The quality of the audio and of the physical product is incredible. I highly recommend acquiring The Beatles Stereo USB while you still can. There is absolutely nothing I regret about my purchase of this product.

B0000TB014|5.0|We all know Michael Jackson was the greastest entertainer of our generation and with this video your able to see perfection at it's  best.I give this DVD 10 stars if I could because it's great to have Michael Jackson on DVD besides having all his CD's.
B000003EUL|5.0|I heard Richter play both the Beethoven #1 (another amazing performance and available on CD) and the Brahms #2 with Charles Munch at a benefit concert for the BSO in the 60s. Everybody knows about Richter, and most people know about Munch (and admire him extravagantly, as I do). But I at first found Leinsdorf (who followed Munch as MD of the BSO) pedantic. Gradually I learned that his technique--keep an even, steady beat, and build the emotion inside it--was incredibly effective. I attended a concert with the BSO at Brooklyn Academy where his conducting of the march from the Tchaikovsky Symphony #6 produced a 15-minute ovation (I timed it). If I had had my wits about me, I would have started a chant of \\"Again! Again!\\"  Herr Leinsdorf merely modestly acknowledged the applause--again and again--and, when we had worn ourselves out, went on to play the fourth movement.     I just bought this CD, which I own on LP. Obviously I recommend it.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I missed the first season of Legend of the Seeker when it aired.  I'm a fan of the genre, however, so I decided to purchase the DVD set.  I was very glad I did.  The show is very well done. If you are a sword and sorcery fan, this is must see TV.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|Brad Pitt has only been more annoying while wearing a skirt and primping for the camera in \\"Troy,\\" and he can suck the energy out of a room like the best of them, so that is saying a mouthful. Remember last year when he played Gollum in a 1920s \\"Forrest Gump\\" prequel and the film came close to winning Oscars in \\"real\\" categories? But next to Eli Roth, a hamhock in a monkey suit, he's positively charming.<br /><br />Apparently nothing more than an overly long vehicle for QT to roll out all the (word that is pronounced NOT-zee) memorabilia he's snagged up on eBay -- and a good way to win the favor of Jerry Lewis before a planned remake of \\"The Nutty Professor\\" -- it's hard not to compare the (word that sounds like HIT-ler) character to the subject of the film, \\"The Passion of the (word that sounds like KRIST).\\" They both expire in an orgy of blood and rage. And just for the record, I don't subscribe to either religious belief ((word that sounds like FASH-ism) or compassionate conservatism) so I'm not airing out some political agenda.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was an excellent book. I think Meyer did a great job putting all the pieces together. I think when Jacob finally imprints it helps tie it all together even more. Ms. Meyer makes the reader become attached to the characters. I am sorry this seems to be the last one. I would like to read of this saga.
B001W63DY6|5.0|Originally I purchased the 3 DVD boxset from Amazon UK but the picture quality was mediocre on my 46\\" LCD. So I had to purchase this Blu Ray. The difference in the picture quality is like day & night. The sound is also so much better on Blu Ray. I have no regrets purchasing the 2006 concert twice.
B002VECM6I|5.0|I love this movie...I saw it tonight, almost a full month after its release date. Im not much for chick flicks but it was AMAZING!!!! I want to buy this movie and I would pay full price to go see it ten more times. I love southern hospitality as well as wholesom vaules and this movie knock them both out of the park. The little boy in the movie and Sanra make it a hit. Dont even rent it, just buy it. It will be the best movie you buy in a very long time.
B002JTHFUS|1.0|Just because you dug up the masters of the outtakes you recorded in between bouts of naked Twister and the Mashed Potato Trot with toothless groupies after Papa Eno descended into his bat cave to diddle his magnetoscope and left you the keys to \\"the castle\\" does not mean you need to release said outtakes to the general public. Millions will be duped just like they were when you performed as ironic Amway cult members, calling yourself Negativland and setting up shop in a cage at the Dublin Zoo with Dana Carvey on satellite drums -- and later as Pavarotti's backing band during his failed attempt to be Subway's spokesperson, losing out to Jared the horse. While we're discussing the classics, that was a classic move on your last tour, hiring an orchestra at slave wages to perform without credit under the bandstand. Very popely, that. Seriously, actually. That is something the pope would probably do. And that dude has street cred. He be rockin the 'Pac all up on his MySpizzace.<br /><br />Just because you're old and crusty and have sunglasses permanently welded to your face does not mean that the general public, which truth be told often isn't able to discern a box's content from its packaging materials, needs to be subjected to your impromptu marriage of \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" with \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" by The Tokens. The original album was bad enough, what with incoherent guitar-and-bass plucks filtered in murky production mixed over Bozo's tight-scrotum vocal pleadings, but a Celtic dub version of \\"Wire\\" that brings to mind disco hour at The 700 Club is shameful on a level with Arnold Schwarzenegger working on a \\"Junior\\" sequel.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has shown the world that talent is what matters when it comes to the music industry.  She is a simple woman with an angelic voice.  She has shown that you do not need sex to sell albums just pure talent.  In this era of raunchy perfomances and scantily clothed artist it distracts from the actual music today.  This album is beautiful.  I love how the instruments in the background are simple and no need for a bunch of synthesizers.<br /><br />I am happy that a demure woman has found a way to show the world that no matter how old you are, you can still say to yourself \\" I DREAMED A DREAM\\" and make it your reality.
1594488843|3.0|This is the first I have read of Daniel Pink, and from what others have said, Drive may not represent his best work.<br />While I was very interested in his theories about what truly motivates us, I found the book to be rather short. Well, the book is thick, but the substance is rather short. I do agree with him that there are plenty of instances where a new management theory is needed that would allow people to perform their best work, but he did not provide many real life examples of it actually working. Sure, there are a few examples given and they were successful, but I would have liked to have seen case studies on a dozen or so companies or organizations that have turned to this type or management style. Drive was interesting, and I think it holds some great truths, but I just think it could have included more in depth information and less fluff. The first half of the book is great, but the second half will leave you wondering if he ran out of time.<br /><br />If you are interested in learning about motivation or management styles, Drive will point you in the right direction but won't necessarily fill in all the blanks.

B002MW50KO|1.0|One star is too high.  I received this as a secret Santa gift and I feel it was a joke.  I've never been a fan, but I respect the artist.  I put in my car and started to listen.  I almost had to flip it out the window.  From the start, I really thought it was a joke.  \\"Here come Santa Claus\\", opens up this farce of a Christmas album.  I understand an artist can take liberties, but WOW, he went too far.  It was like hearing fingernails run across a chalk board.  I said, ok, a bad rendition.  Next, \\"I'll be home for Christmas.  Oh come on, it was a little better, but so it stepping on a tack over a nail.  My ears are in pain.  I could continue, but you get the point.  A terrible album.  At least the proceeds are going to charity.  But I am pretty sure it is after the record label get's it's upfront cost.  Any royalties made on this album for charity will be limited.  A terrible Christmas album.  Go buy a classic Christmas album, your family and ears will appreciate it.  It is hard to ruin Christmas songs, but Mr. Dylan found a way.
B002H3F7F6|2.0|I have enjoyed sting's music since the early 80's when he was in the Police.  I liked his solo career barring a few songs where he has experimented with mixing styles or told too much of a story with the lyrics.  I was disappointed with his less than thrilling 16th century Lute CD \\"Songs From the Labyrinth\\" which although good for what it was, probably sold well due to sting's popularity.  I had high hopes for this CD but sting has let me down once again.  Sting sings several songs with an affected voice which sounds like something from the middle ages.  Most of the music on this CD is not written by sting and the few songs that are are not new, but different versions of existing songs.  I found this odd mix of songs nothing like the sting music I love.  I felt angered that I had spent $16 on this crappy CD.  If you are a sting fan,  I recommend only purchasing a few of the better songs off itunes or don't purchase anything in protest, hoping he will go back to singing what his fans want.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Not much to say. Amazing movie that more people should see. It's a shame that Magnet was too cheap to do the subtitles correctly the first time, but it seems that amazon may have sold their stock of those first press blu ray discs, as my copy is the newer release with the theatrical subtitles included.

076532413X|2.0|Being a fan of the TV series, I approached this book with great enthusiasm. I'm sorry to say I was sorely disappointed. The concept behind the story is interesting - particularly with regard to the contentious topic of the Hadron Collider. Unfortunately, the author failed to live up to the promise. The writing style was dull, the characters flat, and, frankly, I thought twenty one years was too great a jump. I much prefer the six months presented in the television series.<br /><br />I'm afraid this is one of those rare occasions when I prefer the drama of the TV series over the written word.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I'm old enough to remember Julia Child from TV but this film really added a new dimension for me.  The two actresses in this movie are exceptional. Both Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are terrific.  The clip in the movie of Dan Ackroyd doing Julia Child on SNL blew me away,  I forgot about that great skit and how good Ackroyd could be.  The movie was really entertaining in spite of the flash forward and back between Julie and Julia.  It also got me interested in French cooking again.
1584282584|5.0|This book is a great find.  I've ordered other books and usually they are low on content and feel stretched out with basic information and pictures.  This book is refreshing.  It has so much information that I have to highlight re-read and study it because it is jammed packed with excellent easy to understand tips and information.  I hope he keeps writing other books!  You won't regret this purchase!    Update:  I've now reread the book 3 times.  Earlier concepts that I didn't quite catch on to are now becoming clearer.  Each page has so much useful information that you have to put it down a bit and digest what you just learned and go back for more.  This book along with the book \\"The Nikon Creative Lighting System\\" by Mike Hagen have given me a very good education!

I am watching it for the 20th time as we speak. I still laugh and cry. If someone thinks it was filmed poorly. Than u do a better job. I can't imagine ALL the singers and dancers being that easy. And although i am not a fan of Pierce... Bon Jovi he is not but he did a heck of a job with what he had. I give him credit for going beyond his realm and taking in a whole new venue, knowing what people might say. U Go Pierce!! you only live once. Actually I find his voice better and better each time i watch it. Especially wheb he sings.... \\"When all is said and Done\\" And Amanda is a star on the rise.

B002T9H2LA|3.0|The start and the end of the movie are really good, specially<br />the scens at the theatre, where all nazi leaders are killed.<br /><br />The remaining time between start and end of the movie totally sucks,<br />a complete waste of time.

B000063DI9|5.0|English metal masters Iron Maiden's seventh studio album coincidentally called Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was released in April of 1988.<br />The album was the band's first new studio album in nearly two years and coincidentally was to be their last with the five man lineup of singer Bruce Dickinson, guitarists Dave Murray and Adrian Smith, bass player Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain as Smith would resign from the band for a decade until his return on 2000's Brave New World. Iron Maiden and longtime producer Martin Birch made certain that Adrian's last album with Maiden for over a decade was also arguably the band's best album as I found out when I first got the Capitol Record cassette version in May of 1988 and later the remastered CD.<br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was Maiden's first proper concept album about a cursed child who is born with special powers and it tempted by the side of both good and evil. Also, the band was starting to blend more progressive rock into their majestic brand of metal (it's no coincidence that Iron Maiden were influenced by Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, UFO, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Genesis, Jethro Tull and Pink Floyd).<br />We begin the album with \\"Moonchild\\" which begins as an acoustic passage giving this album's theme and then it builds into a superb rocker penned by Smith and Dickinson. Next is the superb \\"Infinite Dreams\\" penned by Harris and was a great progressive metal rocker alternating between quiet and heavy, mid-tempo and fast tempo and as the British call it \\"light and shade\\" sections. Next was the album's biggest hit \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" penned by Smith/Harris/Dickinson which sounded reminiscent to the previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time's biggest hit, \\"Wasted Years\\" and Smith's synthesizer guitar solo here says \\"take that Richie Sambora\\". Next is \\"The Evil That Men Do\\" also penned by Harris/Smith/Dickinson and is another stellar rocker. This song was always one of my favorites.<br />The album's second half begins with the epic length title cut! Like the 13 plus minute \\"Rime Of The Ancient Mariner\\" and 9 minute \\"Alexander The Great\\" before it, it's the longest and best track on the album. Unlike those two aforementioned epics, the Harris penned title cut was the band's first 10 minute track which they created the story themselves. Wonderful musicianship throughout, especially Murray and Smith's guitar duels at the end which is an awesome piece of music. \\"The Prophecy\\" is next and is a great track penned by Murray/Harris and ends with a superb acoustic guitar section. next is the album's third single \\"The Clairvoyant\\" which is another great rocker. We end the album with arguably one of Maiden's best album closers \\"Only The Good Die Young\\". This Harris/Dickinson penned piece is a killer rocker. Then when you think the album ended after the big finish, the album ends with a reprise of the acoustic passage that started Moonchild.<br />Seventh Son of a Seventh Son was yet another Top 20 charting US million seller (to date their last Platinum selling album here in the US) and it was because the material was strong, the production was killer and because it was Iron Maiden!<br />RECOMMENDED!ond half begins with the epic length title cut!

B00122RDAA|5.0|On SHAKEN 'N' STIRRED, Robert Plant finally took a dive into the synth pool he waded in on his previous album PRINCIPLE OF MOMENTS. Numerous Zep fans were undoubtedly baffled, but I think this is a fun album that has two of his best ever tracks - \\"Sixes and Sevens\\" and the other one previously known simply as \\"Little By Little (extended mix),\\" a truly transcendental song, previously available only on a 12\\" single release. These tunes also get a wet hot kiss from Toni Halliday, whose inventive, totally sexy vocals just nail it. Bias alert - I'm a huge fan of her own \\"waves-of-shoegaze\\" band known as Curve. She's totally hot!<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Hip To Hoo\\" - a strange circus fade in on keyboards abruptly erupts into giddy circus acrobats. Plant soon booms in full throttle as the intensity cranks up. Robbie Blunt even throws in some tasty rockabilly guitar. A wild, weird experiment that just works. ****<br /><br />\\"Kallalou Kallalou\\" - The jerky rhythm gets under your skin as another woman is breakin' Robert's heart while he begs her to stay. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Too Loud\\" - If you liked the first two tracks you'll happily keep groovin' on this infectious take down of some bugged-out chick. Toni just makes me drool with her \\"Huh! Huh! Huh! . . . AAAAAH\\" croons. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Trouble Your Money\\" - creeps in on a quietly urgent beat but before long Plant is writhing in anguish. ****<br /><br />\\"Pink & Black\\" - It's no secret that Robert Plant's been a long-time Elvis fan and the evidence is quite palpable on this pumped up rocker. Plant owns it.  *****<br /><br />\\"Little By Little\\" - I'm old enough to remember when MTV was young and I watched the video for this song whenever I got the chance. It was in heavy rotation and it made a big impression on me. Probably the first non-Zep Plant I ever heard and I still think it's one of his best. *****<br /><br />\\"Doo Doo A Do Do\\" - the boner-bass intro on this one signifies Robert is in a party mood. \\"Shake for me baby\\" . . . a cool rocker. *****<br /><br />\\"Easily Lead\\" - this is a first-class take on New Wave and the most pumped up thing on the album. ****<br /><br />\\"Sixes & Sevens\\" - The last track on the original album is Plant at his best.

B000ETQR3Q|5.0|Alright, let me start off by saying this. The Longshot is a great gun! And I am 13 but still. Here are some pros and cons of this gun and the pros are much better than the cons.    Pros    Awesome fire power  Good Range  Good accuracy  Extra clip storage  Fast reloading  Bolt Action  I can fire about 14 darts in about 12 seconds while reloading a clip    Cons    Takes time to put darts in clips  Sometimes jams  Scope doesn't work  Attachment pistol doesn't shoot well  Too big if you add the extra pistol    Tips-    There's a little hole in the bottom of each darts. If you put those facing downward and to darts towards the back of the clips and the blaster will fire extremely accurate.    Another thing is that you can put 7 darts in each clip at one time instead of the Nerf recommended 6.    AND MAKE SURE that you don't connect the bolt to itself if it's not in the action. I did this and I ruined the gun.     Also do NOT store your darts in the clips keep them in a separate container of some sort. If you store them in the clips u will smash the darts and flatten them out and they won't shoot again.    And one more thing! BUY EXTRA DARTS!     I hope my review helps you make a great purchase.
B0025KVLVA|4.0|This one album, or actually both were missing in my CD collection of the Beatles. I used to have it spreaded out over different vinyl records. I must say that a lot of songs sound crispy and fresh. Unfortunatly not all of the songs. But I'm very satisfied, I'm almost sorry that I already have all the other albums. Maybe I'll buy an remastered version of Rubber Soul and Revolver. Just because I like the result of Past Masters so much. It's a very good deal to have both Past Masters in one buy.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Ordinarily, I'd have to agree that this might seem a little steep.  Five episodes, five disks, $40+.  But if this is comparable to the British release, in addition to the specials you're also getting the full Doctor Who Confidential episodes for each special (as opposed to the 'Cut Downs' normally included in the Doctor Who boxed sets), David Tennant's video diaries (which are always good for a laugh, in my opinion) and the Doctor Who at the Proms special from last year which hasn't been released in this country at all.    Of course, I'd really prefer to see some confirmation from Amazon that this release matches the Region 2 release in the UK (which is out in January, incidentally).  If it does, I'd say it's worth what they're asking.
B000O599WG|5.0|Instead of giving away the entire story, let me just say don't miss this movie. This is a great John Wayne movie and Dean Martin's best performance. Add the unforgettable Walter Brennan & a good performance by a young Ricky Nelson and you have the perfect movie for a Saturday afternoon with the family. Enjoy.
B000002KIE|4.0|For years, my reaction to anyone who claimed this was their favorite punk album was to assume they'd never heard it. Maybe they had a Sid Vicious t-shirt and a Green Day CD. Why? I was 14 when I first heard Anarchy - Radio Luxembourg had an interview with the band right after the Bill Grudy TV show. They played Anarchy three or four times and I Wanna Be Me twice. Visceral, blistering and exciting. I wanted to tell everyone I knew about this band, these songs. When God Save The Queen was released, the local record store had one copy and I stood there for hours hoping they'd play it a second time. Oh, and that b-side! No Fun....Pretty Vacant made Top of the Pops, but the initial thrill was gone.    Then Bollocks came out. Cajoled a tape from a friend's older brother. Rush home. Oh Dear. Far and away the best moments were the singles I'd already heard. Apart from Submission, nothing else was as good as No Fun or I Wanna Be Me. Much, much worse. Dull. Being 15, I loved Bodies. He was angry! He was cussing! He was venomous. Apart from that, I was deeply disappointed. Stomach ache disappointed. Listen-to-it-again-hoping-it's-better disappointing. And that was that. Until I was 17 and outgrew the shock value of Bodies. Poor Johnny Rotten wasn't yet ready to deal with the personal. Oh, and around this time they sang a song called \\"Belsen Was a Gas\\". Yeah, after Glen Matlock they were nothing. Complete and utterly worthless. Irrelevant.    25 years go by and I listened to Bollocks again. Blown Away by the singles, Submission now my favorite, Seventeen moving up the list. Even Holidays sounds better. Steve Jones impresses throughout; Lydon's petulant, angry, paranoid squaling raises the hair on my neck (oh, how I wish Bodies had a point of view...); the drummer appears competent. It's best thought of as a Greatest Hits package. The short, sharp, shock of the first three singles no longer overwhelms the album. Worth buying, worth listening to. If you missed the singles as theycame out, and this was the first time you heard them, it's a terrific album, despite some clunkers like EMI and New York.    Oh, and revolution aside. It's now available everywhere even in an Eco-Friendly Package.    John Lydon would move on to create one of the all time best albums with PIL Metal Box/Second Edition. Finally he got the personal and broader politics right.Perfectly right. Challenging and brilliant. Justified belief inhis warped intellect. Tragically, that was it. Was he replaced by a less intelligent twin? Who knows.
0143038583|1.0|Wonderful title and overall the idea of organizing a book around the four main food systems in the United States is great.  The truth is, for many, a trip to the grocery store has many dilemmas which must be faced.  Pollan is an investigative journalist from Berkeley, CA and goes directly to the source of various ingredients to make a meal from each of the four food systems in the United States.  He begins with going to a corn farm to help plant seed corn in the spring and follows the corn through various channels of processing and to a beef lot where the corn is used to finish a steer.  The section on what he terms \\"Industrial Agriculture\\" ends with a meal from McDonald's which he eats in his car.  Pollan continues by exploring the \\"Big Organic\\" food system, a \\"Beyond Organic\\" food system which is the locally grown organic, and ends with the \\"Hunter - Gatherer\\" food system where he hunts and kills a wild hog and gathers mushrooms and other ingredients for a meal.<br /><br />I purchased and read this book upon recommendation from a friend/co-worker who described it in a similar manner which I did above.  My friend also added that Pollan takes a critical look at each of the four food systems, offering advantages and criticism of each.  I thought to myself, this should be good; explore the food systems, take a critical look at each, the U.S. actually needs a book like this in order to be better informed consumers.  My friend also asked me to read the book for a professional development opportunity which he was organizing for other teachers to participate in a review of this book.  It is only fair to point out the fact that my colleague and friend who recommended the book is a high school English teacher who readily admits that he knows nothing about agriculture.  For his sake I read the book cover to cover and dissected every detail.<br /><br />Pollan is an outstanding creative writer and tells a great story.  However, the journalism aspect of his writing (finding and reporting facts) are shoddy workmanship to say the least.  Please allow me to qualify this statement, first with some of my credentials.<br /><br />I am a fifth generation agriculturalist in this country and my roots in agriculture run even deeper when my family's history is traced back to the time before immigration into the U.S.  I was born into agriculture, thus I lay claim to all 35 years of my life as actual experience in agriculture.  I earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural education and have engaged in a great deal of additional professional training, reading, as well as travel to conferences & workshops, touring a wide variety of agricultural facilities, and networking with other agriculture professionals from around the world.  I am a past state president of a professional agriculture organization and served a total of six years as a state officer of that organization.  I have been published in a peer reviewed professional journal and have been invited to present professional workshops on several occasions throughout my career.<br />Today's U.S. Agriculture is nothing short of awesome.  Even with my extensive training in this field, I still learn new things every year that amaze me about our total agricultural food system. I have hundreds of resource books at my disposal; have travelled tens of thousands of miles to learn, tour, network, explore, and further educate myself about agriculture; I also have countless hours of real experience producing various crops and livestock, research, and learning.  U.S. Agriculture is complex to say the least and it is feeble minded for anyone to believe that an investigative journalist (or any person for that matter) could even begin to scratch the surface of today's global food system in one book that is 400+ pages in length.<br /><br />I support the idea of all food systems.  I do consume from each of them and feel strongly that all systems are necessary.  What I do not support is the extreme use of rhetoric andfalse assumption used to market organic or local food to an ignorant public.  Most readers would assume that Pollan reports the findings of his food systems investigation in great detail.  However, the average U.S. citizen is three or more generations removed from the farm which makes them extremely vulnerable to misconceptions about agriculture.  There is an assumption that food will always be in the grocery store and we believe we understand subjects which we actually do not; we fear the wrong things; and we do not fear the right things.  Unfortunately many of the misconceptions about agriculture come from superficial reporting by media including this book, \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma.\\"  As of today, there are 600 people who have written reviews of this book at Amazon.com, of which 528 rated the book at 4 stars or higher.  I fully realize that I am in the minority here and I would also bet that I have more professional credentials and experience in agriculture than all 528 of those writers put together.<br /><br />I paid money for this book based upon my friend's recommendation expecting to read a balanced source regarding all of the different food systems.  However, this book is far from balanced in its approach to each of the four food systems.  Pollan chooses to demonizes the \\"industrial\\" agriculture system throughout the book.  Big organic and hunter gatherer systems are closer to being critiqued fairly with pros and cons.  The Local organic system receives nothing but praise throughout the book.  There are several pieces of information which Pollan either missed during his investigation or he forgot to report to us in his book.  Further, there are several pieces of information which he did print that simply are not true and of course there are those pieces which are factual but twisted out of context.  I will give specific examples later in my review, but bearing these things in mind, I have to question whether Michael Pollan is even an expert in journalism due to his struggles with reporting the facts in the proper context.  I already knew that he was not an expert in agriculture before I started to read the book.  But after reading, I have to wonder whether or not he is even qualified to write a book on a subject as complex as agriculture.<br /><br />As a fictional resource read for entertainment purposes only, I would give this book five stars.  The American public would do well to gain its information from a variety of experts in a particular field (in this case agriculture) rather than only from investigative journalists who are really not experts at anything.  If you have not heard the good news about American agriculture, then I content that you are not getting the right information and your information is coming from the wrong sources.<br /><br />On the cover, the New York Times Book Review is quoted as saying \\"Thoughtful, engrossing . . . you're not likely to get a better explanation of exactly where food comes from.\\" I would certainly beg to differ with this statement and would challenge readers to consider if the New York Times Book Review would know if they received a \\"better explanation of where food comes from?\\"<br /><br />Why isn't \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" endorsed by any sources with any credible expertise in agriculture?<br /><br />Now a little about the very end of the book.  Michael Pollan provides a very impressive 18 page inclusion of sources which he used in writing this text.  As I reviewed the sources it became very apparent to me why his book leans toward the local organic food system and against the \\"industrial\\" food system.  Well, how can we tell if a source is credible or not?  Some questions which you should ask yourself to identify a credible source include:<br /><br />1.  What is the track record of an organization? (Some organizations have been predicting doom and gloom for decades and they have not been correct yet.)<br /><br />2.  By what authority are they making claims? (Many environmental groups or animal rights groups claim to have conducted scientific research, but do not have any Ph.D. scientists on their staff.  Discredited individuals often bounce from position to position claiming their expertise, but their peers do not thing highly of their capability or credibility)<br /><br />3.  How long has this organization been in existence and what has been its purpose?  (Groups surface overnight and make claims that cannot be substantiated, but the media report on it anyway.)<br /><br />4.  Who funds this group?<br /><br />5.  How important is creating a public uproar to their fundraising abilities?  Actually, this is probably the most important question in the case of this book.  Public uproar sells books, movies, and speaking engagements, all of which Michael Pollan has an extremely large vested interest.<br /><br />For example, one of many reasons Pollan is against \\"industrial\\" corn in his book is the use of Atrazine as a pesticide as he claims on page 178 (which is in the \\"Big Organic\\" section, but he's still ranting on and on about \\"industrial\\") \\"that Atrazine has been shown to turn normal male frogs into hermaphrodites.\\"  He cites his source as [...] (Pesticide Action Network North America) - I visited the site today and found that they still make this claim - go to the site yourself and compare it against the questions I listed previously.  Is PANNA really a source which we can call credible?  Researchers have found that a parasite caused the mutation and in other peer-reviewed studies, scientists have not found any connection between agriculture and mutated frogs.  Dr. Gene Larsen at the University of Minnesota made the discovery of parasites as the cause.  Don't take my word for it, go to the source and check it out for yourself - some of these sources have only been available since 1996 so I can certainly see how Pollan missed them (sarcasm).  \\"Deformed frog mystery\\" by Sean Hanahan at [...].  \\"Frog Population Declines and Malformations - is Atrazine a factor?\\" by Sherry Ford and Kay Carter at [...].  You can even look at \\"White Paper on Potential Developmental Effects of Atrazine on Amphibians\\" by Thomas Steeger and Joseph Tietge at [...].<br />I was disappointed that he either misinterpreted or chose to report facts out of context, one such example follows:  Pollan is correct that Sec. of Ag. Earl Butz told farmers to do whatever they could to increase yield specifically \\"plant fence post to fence post.\\" He suggests that Butz wanted to \\"drive up agricultural yields in order to drive down the price of the industrial food chain's raw materials.\\" (p. 103) This is a major hitch pin in Pollan's argument against corn and its \\"industrial, surplus\\" nature. However, he is completely out of context - Butz told farmers to plant fence post to fence post in the early 1970's after he and the grain companies of the U.S. negotiated the largest sale of grain to Russia - he told farmers this because they would be able to expect good prices due to the increased demand. The whole thing is documented in a book titled \\"Merchants of Grain\\" which Pollan cites in his resources, but he completely missed the mark in the context of his reporting.<br /><br />Probably the most disappointing  piece for me throughout the book is the drastic omission of facts.  Of course he does this to make one system (\\"industrial Ag\\") look terrible and another system (local organic) appear great.<br /><br />Omissions of facts in conventional agriculture - He does this severely when discussing the feedlot situation with cattle and the feeding of corn. He chooses not to tell the reader about the forage or waste food processing products (almond hulls, carrot waste, soybean oil meal, tomato pomace, beet pulp, distiller's grain, etc.) which are also fed to cattle in the feedlot in addition to the corn. He actually does a nice job on an elementary level of explaining the rumen function and bloat, however he does not tell the reader that each differentfeed requires a different bacteria to digest it. When feeds are changed too much too fast, cattle might not have enough of that bacteria in the rumen and thus will bloat. He further does not tell the reader that high heat also causes bloat. Or that alfalfa will also cause bloat if the cattle are not used to eating it (I've observed this happen) - Alfalfa would normally be considered OK as a grass-fed feedstuff. He goes on to explain that antibiotics are given to cattle, specifically Rumensin and Tylosin; however he leads the reader to believe that these products are given to all animals the entire time they are in the feedlot, which is completely false. Another fact that he missed is that Rumensin is not an antibiotic. If cattle have been already started on a feed ration which included corn then there is no need to give them Rumensin - if not, then the Rumensin is given only at the beginning of the feedlot period and then as necessary to promote bacteria growth in the rumen and to prevent coccidiosis (caused by the coccidia protozoa, NOT A BACTERIA). He is correct that the Tylosin is an anti-biotic, but he does not tell the reader that this is also given at the beginning and as needed to prevent the onset of disease caused by \\"stress\\" - shipping, change in environment, weather, handling, etc. He doesn't tell you about the slim profit margin in finishing these cattle and that administering too much of any pharmaceutical for any reason will drastically cut into that profit margin. He doesn't tell the reader that the reason why corn is fed to cattle is because it contains more energy than hay, is less bulky to store than hay, and can be stored year-round unlike fresh grass.  He does suggest that all conventionally produced animals are \\"suffering\\" in some way, but does not mention that \\"suffering\\" animals do not produce or gain well to be economically sustainable.<br /><br />In the section on corn, Pollan chooses not to tell the readers about precision agriculture, conservation tillage farming (the most sustainable farming system in history which cuts soil erosion by 90% and reduces energy use). He also does not tell us that erosion on cropland in the United States has been reduced by 40% (from 4 tons per acre to 2.6 tons per acre) since 1982. He talks about farm subsidies, but doesn't tell the readers that less than 1% (more than 70% of which is nutrition assistance programs including WIC, Welfare, and School Lunch/Breakfast programs) of the federal budget goes to agriculture, yet agriculture accounts for nearly 20% of the Gross Domestic Product for the United States. He doesn't tell the reader that farm subsidies protect us as consumers from monopolies producing our food which keeps our food affordable or that those subsidies help the individual farmer compete with cheap labor from other countries which keeps our food more local and safe.  He further assumes that all conventional farms receive some sort of subsidy payment, which is also false.  An underlying thought from Pollan regarding corn is that \\"food scientists and others are always trying to come up with new ways to gobble up the huge surplus.\\"  When in fact the reality is that demand for corn has increased and farmers work hard to meet that demand - if in fact the surplus were as huge as he says, we would see much lower prices on that particular commodity.  Of course this is not an exhaustive list of examples .<br /><br />Michael Pollan attempts to indoctrinate the reader into believing that \\"cheap food\\" is expensive in terms of health problems such as obesity, type II diabetes, and heart disease.  In fact, these diseases are quite expensive in terms of medical issues, but is it really fair to blame these issues only on the conventional agriculture system without also taking into account a lack of physical activity, portion sizes, frequency of eating, and genetics?  Please keep in mind that \\"industrial\\" agriculture (I prefer to call it conventional) is everything that isnot organic or hunted/gathered.  Also, please keep in mind that ALL FOOD produced in the United States up until around World War II was produced organically.  Is it possible to be healthy while eating only from the conventional food system?  Is it possible to not be healthy while eating only from the organic food system?  It is an undeniable fact that life expectancy has increased significantly in the United States over the last 100 years (47 years in 1909 to 77 years today).<br /><br />Pollan omits facts about the organic production, making this method appear better than it is.  He tells us on page 159 that \\"instead of toxic pesticides, insects are controlled by spraying approved organic agents such as rotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine sulfate.\\"  What he doesn't tell us is that EVERYTHING is toxic at some level of exposure.  He further chooses not to tell the reader that natural pesticides are not necessarily less toxic (some are less toxic, but many are more toxic) than synthetic pesticides.  Specifically these pesticides which he gives examples of are actually more toxic than most synthetic pesticides - Copper Sulfate is highly toxic, shown to cause liver disease, and was recently banned in Europe; Rotenone is a nerve toxin which may cause Parkinson's disease and the EPA is actually conducting a code red risk assessment for Rotenone to reconsider its registration (don't worry, I didn't get the press release about this either); and actually, Pyrethrum is a synthetic insecticide used by traditional agriculture and pyrethrin is the organic form - essentially these are the same compound with the same function, but pyrethrin comes from a natural plant source and breaks down more quickly in the environment which means that it has to be sprayed more often to be effective, thus kills more beneficial insects as a result and was recently listed by EPA as a likely human carcinogen.  He also does not report that many of these organic products need to be (and are) applied several times or at higher rates to protect the targeted crops.<br /><br />Further, because organic production cannot use herbicides to control weeds, many mechanically cultivate their crops to keep weeds under control leaving the soil surface unprotected and subject to increased soil erosion and moisture loss.  He would really like us to believe that the only sustainable form of food production is organic, but he doesn't tell us that with organic production yields decrease by 30 to 40 percent (the Danish government actually found even greater impacts than this as they considered a move to only organic production - they found it to be 47%).  The first ever Census of Organic Agriculture was recently published and on some crops here in Montana yields were even lower than what the Danes found.  For example, is the 17 bushels/acre average yield for organic barley sustainable when compared to the 52 bushels/acre average for conventional barley?  That is a 67% reduction in yield.  He also doesn't tell us that to produce the necessary nitrogen to grow crops would require either conversion of 1/3 of all crop acreage into green manure production (usually legumes grown to be plowed into the soil) which would be on top of the 30-40% yield reduction OR to increase the number of cattle on the planet by 700% - Vaclav Smil professor of geography from the University of Manitoba made this calculation.  The U.S. alone would have to raise 1 billion additional cattle to replace the nitrogen from commercial sources.  Is this possible?  We currently have 97 million head in the U.S. and globally there are 1.3 billion.  If every square foot of private and public land including all parks, forests, wildlife refuges, golf courses, roadsides, and lawns were grazed by cattle there would still not be enough land to graze that many cattle in the United States.  You can imagine the devastation to the environment that strictly organic production would have on our planet.<br /><br />He also doesn't tell us that manure is very bulky and thus expensive to handle when spreading onto crops.  Earthbound farms uses 20-30 tons of composted manure per acre and their farm is 10,000 acres in size.  How many more pounds of raw manure are required to make that much compost?  Further, there is a real assumption that all nutrients are in manure in general for organic production, this is also false.  If the nutrient is not in the soil it will not be in the feed; if the nutrient is not in the feed it will not be in the manure; if it's not in the manure, it's not getting back to the soil.  Don't get me wrong, the manure should get put back onto the soil, there is just no way that it can be our primary source of plant nutrition.  Manure's nutrient composition is also inconsistent throughout making it difficult to get the right nutrient in the right place in the field.<br /><br />I wish that Pollan would have chosen to interview a farmer who is more advanced in his adoption and use of modern farming practices - George Naylor (\\"industrial corn farmer\\") could probably be considered \\"advanced\\" when compared to 1980's standards. If Pollan would have chosen to abandon his agenda and spend time with a modern 21st century U.S. farmer he would have found a producer who is on the cutting edge of technology and actually doing a better job of both producing higher yields and caring for the environment than ever before in history.  Precision agriculture technology is simply amazing at using less synthetic fertilizer and pesticides by applying them only where they are needed.<br /><br />The USDA has recently reported that 36 million people are hungry in America. These people are not worried about whether or not the food they purchase is organic or locally grown or if the chickens are \\"free range\\" or the meat is \\"hormone free\\", etc. The bottom line is that we need all food systems in the United States to feed not only our country, but also to contribute to the world's food supply.<br /><br />World population is growing quickly and with population growth we lose land which can be used to produce food. How will we feed the world when the population increases to 10-12 billion? How will we feed all of their pets as well?? The only possible answer is that we have to get behind high yield agriculture in order to produce enough food - we truly need another green revolution.  This has to be considered, and I fear that books such as this one actually get in the way of any meaningful dialect taking place in terms of world food production.<br /><br />I like the idea of local food and believe it to be great for local economy and it also seems to provide great opportunities (business & hobby or both) for those who would like to farm small acreages. However, a definition of \\"local\\" is really necessary before any criticism of \\"industrial\\" agriculture is to take place. How far away is no longer considered local?? And what is \\"industrial agriculture\\" and what is not? As much as these terms are tossed around throughout the book, it is only fair they have a concrete definition rather than just a generalization that is used to throw the rest of us under the bus.<br /><br />Other questions which Pollan chooses not to ask or answer in his book are:<br /><br />What happens when we have a shortage of food production due to drought, disease, or other in some area of the country?<br /><br />How do we obtain food items which we cannot or do not produce? I live in the Pacific Northwest in an area with a growing season of only 100 days. A recent study by agricultural experts from Washington State University suggests that local food actually ends up using more energy and not less.<br /><br />What do we do with our surplus food production? For example: 70% of Montana is rangeland not suitable to cultivation. We have a comparative advantage over many places in the world for producing cattle and as a result there are approximately 3 cows for every person in our state (a small number whencompared to the 6 million bison which used to roam the range up here belching methane into the atmosphere) - there are only so many that can stay here to be used locally. We are also the 5th largest wheat producer in the country. Our dry climate here is actually very good for producing high quality wheat and we are the only place in the world which grows five of the six different wheat classes. A great deal of our wheat is and has to be shipped out of Montana.<br /><br />What about comparative advantages? Shouldn't food be produced in the places of the world that are best suited to do so?<br /><br />What about those fresh produce items which are not aesthetically or otherwise suitable to be sold as fresh produce but are great for a processed food product? Examples might be ketchup, soups, salad dressings, frozen concentrated orange juice, applesauce etc.<br /><br />What about balance of trade for our country?<br /><br />What about consumer choice?<br /><br />What about consistency of food products?<br /><br />What about the changes in the American family (demographics, structure, morals) and their eating habits?  Most moms work outside the home.  Many parents are divorced.  Sitting down to eat a meal together on a regular basis is a lost art in many homes.<br /><br />We are all very fortunate to live in the United States of America where we pay the least of any country for our food at less than 10% of our disposable income after taxes. Not only is our food the cheapest, but it is also the safest and most plentiful and provided in the greatest variety compared to anywhere in the world. If you're going to cut down American agriculture, please keep in mind that you do have the option of living somewhere in the world other than the United States.  When food becomes more expensive to the consumer, what industries and jobs which have been built because people have more money to spend should we get rid of? Ultimately the free market will make this decision. But, will it be tourism-related? Entertainment and recreation-related? Technology & computer related? Medical & health related? Automobile related? Real-estate related? Savings & investing related? Communications related? I'm just curious to know what people will cut out of their lives when more of their dollar has to be spent on food.<br /><br />Please go to the experts in agriculture for information about agriculture. The following websites should be helpful to get you started:<br /><br />American Farm Bureau Federation - be sure to order your copy of the Food and Farm Facts book. You'll be amazed at how poorly Michael Pollan did at reporting on modern agriculture through his book - Keep in mind though, he's only a journalist while the people compiling the facts booklet are experts in agriculture. [...] and [...].<br /><br />Feedstuffs Food Link Connecting Farm to Fork at [...].<br /><br />Safe Food Inc. is a website put together by agricultural experts as a rebuttal to the movie Food Inc. [...].ervation tillage farming (the most sustainable farming system in history which cuts soil erosion by 90% and reduces energy use). He also does not tell us that erosion on cropland in the United States has been reduced by 40% (from 4 tons per acre to 2.6 tons per acre) since 1982. He talks about farm subsidies, but doesn't tell the readers that less than 1% (more than 70% of which is nutrition assistance programs including WIC, Welfare, and School Lunch/Breakfast programs) of the federal budget goes to agriculture, yet agriculture accounts for nearly 20% of the Gross Domestic Product for the United States. He doesn't tell the reader that farm subsidies protect us as consumers from monopolies producing our food which keeps our food affordable or that those subsidies help the individual farmer compete with cheap labor from other countries which keeps our food more local and safe.  He further assumes that all conventional farms receive some sort of subsidy payment, which is also false.  An underlying thought from Pollan regarding corn is that \\"food scientists and others are always trying to come up with new ways to gobble up the huge surplus.\\"  When in fact the reality is that demand for corn has increased and farmers work hard to meet that demand - if in fact the surplus were as huge as he says, we would see much lower prices on that particular commodity.  Of course this is not an exhaustive list of examples .<br /><br />Michael Pollan attempts to indoctrinate the reader into believing that \\"cheap food\\" is expensive in terms of health problems such as obesity, type II diabetes, and heart disease.  In fact, these diseases are quite expensive in terms of medical issues, but is it really fair to blame these issues only on the conventional agriculture system without also taking into account a lack of physical activity, portion sizes, frequency of eating, and genetics?  Please keep in mind that \\"industrial\\" agriculture (I prefer to call it conventional) is everything that isnot organic or hunted/gathered.  Also, please keep in mind that ALL FOOD produced in the United States up until around World War II was produced organically.  Is it possible to be healthy while eating only from the conventional food system?  Is it possible to not be healthy while eating only from the organic food system?  It is an undeniable fact that life expectancy has increased significantly in the United States over the last 100 years (47 years in 1909 to 77 years today).<br /><br />Pollan omits facts about the organic production, making this method appear better than it is.  He tells us on page 159 that \\"instead of toxic pesticides, insects are controlled by spraying approved organic agents such as rotenone, pyrethrum, and nicotine sulfate.\\"  What he doesn't tell us is that EVERYTHING is toxic at some level of exposure.  He further chooses not to tell the reader that natural pesticides are not necessarily less toxic (some are less toxic, but many are more toxic) than synthetic pesticides.  Specifically these pesticides which he gives examples of are actually more toxic than most synthetic pesticides - Copper Sulfate is highly toxic, shown to cause liver disease, and was recently banned in Europe; Rotenone is a nerve toxin which may cause Parkinson's disease and the EPA is actually conducting a code red risk assessment for Rotenone to reconsider its registration (don't worry, I didn't get the press release about this either); and actually, Pyrethrum is a synthetic insecticide used by traditional agriculture and pyrethrin is the organic form - essentially these are the same compound with the same function, but pyrethrin comes from a natural plant source and breaks down more quickly in the environment which means that it has to be sprayed more often to be effective, thus kills more beneficial insects as a result and was recently listed by EPA as a likely human carcinogen.  He also does not report that many of these organic products need to be (and are) applied several times or at higher rates to protect the targeted crops.<br /><br />Further, because organic production cannot use herbicides to control weeds, many mechanically cultivate their crops to keep weeds under control leaving the soil surface unprotected and subject to increased soil erosion and moisture loss.  He would really like us to believe that the only sustainable form of food production is organic, but he doesn't tell us that with organic production yields decrease by 30 to 40 percent (the Danish government actually found even greater impacts than this as they considered a move to only organic production - they found it to be 47%).  The first ever Census of Organic Agriculture was recently published and on some crops here in Montana yields were even lower than what the Danes found.  For example, is the 17 bushels/acre average yield for organic barley sustainable when compared to the 52 bushels/acre average for conventional barley?  That is a 67% reduction in yield.  He also doesn't tell us that to produce the necessary nitrogen to grow crops would require either conversion of 1/3 of all crop acreage into green manure production (usually legumes grown to be plowed into the soil) which would be on top of the 30-40% yield reduction OR to increase the number of cattle on the planet by 700% - Vaclav Smil professor of geography from the University of Manitoba made this calculation.  The U.S. alone would have to raise 1 billion additional cattle to replace the nitrogen from commercial sources.  Is this possible?  We currently have 97 million head in the U.S. and globally there are 1.3 billion.  If every square foot of private and public land including all parks, forests, wildlife refuges, golf courses, roadsides, and lawns were grazed by cattle there would still not be enough land to graze that many cattle in the United States.  You can imagine the devastation to the environment that strictly organic production would have on our planet.<br /><br />He also doesn't tell us that manure is very bulky and thus expensive to handle when spreading onto crops.  Earthbound farms uses 20-30 tons of composted manure per acre and their farm is 10,000 acres in size.  How many more pounds of raw manure are required to make that much compost?  Further, there is a real assumption that all nutrients are in manure in general for organic production, this is also false.  If the nutrient is not in the soil it will not be in the feed; if the nutrient is not in the feed it will not be in the manure; if it's not in the manure, it's not getting back to the soil.  Don't get me wrong, the manure should get put back onto the soil, there is just no way that it can be our primary source of plant nutrition.  Manure's nutrient composition is also inconsistent throughout making it difficult to get the right nutrient in the right place in the field.<br /><br />I wish that Pollan would have chosen to interview a farmer who is more advanced in his adoption and use of modern farming practices - George Naylor (\\"industrial corn farmer\\") could probably be considered \\"advanced\\" when compared to 1980's standards. If Pollan would have chosen to abandon his agenda and spend time with a modern 21st century U.S. farmer he would have found a producer who is on the cutting edge of technology and actually doing a better job of both producing higher yields and caring for the environment than ever before in history.  Precision agriculture technology is simply amazing at using less synthetic fertilizer and pesticides by applying them only where they are needed.<br /><br />The USDA has recently reported that 36 million people are hungry in America. These people are not worried about whether or not the food they purchase is organic or locally grown or if the chickens are \\"free range\\" or the meat is \\"hormone free\\", etc. The bottom line is that we need all food systems in the United States to feed not only our country, but also to contribute to the world's food supply.<br /><br />World population is growing quickly and with population growth we lose land which can be used to produce food. How will we feed the world when the population increases to 10-12 billion? How will we feed all of their pets as well?? The only possible answer is that we have to get behind high yield agriculture in order to produce enough food - we truly need another green revolution.  This has to be considered, and I fear that books such as this one actually get in the way of any meaningful dialect taking place in terms of world food production.<br /><br />I like the idea of local food and believe it to be great for local economy and it also seems to provide great opportunities (business & hobby or both) for those who would like to farm small acreages. However, a definition of \\"local\\" is really necessary before any criticism of \\"industrial\\" agriculture is to take place. How far away is no longer considered local?? And what is \\"industrial agriculture\\" and what is not? As much as these terms are tossed around throughout the book, it is only fair they have a concrete definition rather than just a generalization that is used to throw the rest of us under the bus.<br /><br />Other questions which Pollan chooses not to ask or answer in his book are:<br /><br />What happens when we have a shortage of food production due to drought, disease, or other in some area of the country?<br /><br />How do we obtain food items which we cannot or do not produce? I live in the Pacific Northwest in an area with a growing season of only 100 days. A recent study by agricultural experts from Washington State University suggests that local food actually ends up using more energy and not less.<br /><br />What do we do with our surplus food production? For example: 70% of Montana is rangeland not suitable to cultivation. We have a comparative advantage over many places in the world for producing cattle and as a result there are approximately 3 cows for every person in our state (a small number whencompared to the 6 million bison which used to roam the range up here belching methane into the atmosphere) - there are only so many that can stay here to be used locally. We are also the 5th largest wheat producer in the country. Our dry climate here is actually very good for producing high quality wheat and we are the only place in the world which grows five of the six different wheat classes. A great deal of our wheat is and has to be shipped out of Montana.<br /><br />What about comparative advantages? Shouldn't food be produced in the places of the world that are best suited to do so?<br /><br />What about those fresh produce items which are not aesthetically or otherwise suitable to be sold as fresh produce but are great for a processed food product? Examples might be ketchup, soups, salad dressings, frozen concentrated orange juice, applesauce etc.<br /><br />What about balance of trade for our country?<br /><br />What about consumer choice?<br /><br />What about consistency of food products?<br /><br />What about the changes in the American family (demographics, structure, morals) and their eating habits?  Most moms work outside the home.  Many parents are divorced.  Sitting down to eat a meal together on a regular basis is a lost art in many homes.<br /><br />We are all very fortunate to live in the United States of America where we pay the least of any country for our food at less than 10% of our disposable income after taxes. Not only is our food the cheapest, but it is also the safest and most plentiful and provided in the greatest variety compared to anywhere in the world. If you're going to cut down American agriculture, please keep in mind that you do have the option of living somewhere in the world other than the United States.  When food becomes more expensive to the consumer, what industries and jobs which have been built because people have more money to spend should we get rid of? Ultimately the free market will make this decision. But, will it be tourism-related? Entertainment and recreation-related? Technology & computer related? Medical & health related? Automobile related? Real-estate related? Savings & investing related? Communications related? I'm just curious to know what people will cut out of their lives when more of their dollar has to be spent on food.<br /><br />Please go to the experts in agriculture for information about agriculture.

0440236304|5.0|Donald R. Burgett has produced four excellent works concerning his experiences while a member of Col. Bob Sink's 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the fabled 101st Airborne Division. His details of his experiences of training and jumping into battle at Normandy put you right in the thick of his experiences. His graphic descriptions of what he saw, smelled, tasted and felt will bring you right into this environment like no other book I've read. The action comes fast and this is a book that you can't put down and will read from chapter to chapter and then be disappointed when you finish the book if you don't have his next work about Operation Market garden,The Road to Arnhem.     I recommend all of Burgett's books about his experiences and the humble man who wrote them. This is a must read for WWII history fans and 101st Airborne fans.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|I have to say I wasn't disappointed, but then I wasn't expecting much - and it met my expectations.  For those who have read the book it may fall a little flat.  In the Order of the Phoenix there are 2 scenes that epitomize what I am looking for in a movie and what the Half blood prince actually delivers.  In OotP the scene where Sirius dies was devastating, but then it would be very difficult to mess that up.  It is the emotion I am looking for not the exact words or scenes.  Instead this movie compares to the book as the OotP scene at the end where Harry was in Dumbledores office.  In the book it seemed to be the culmination of all the anger Harry had experienced and built up to.  Instead it was if they were reading the words off a page, hey maybe they were.  All the emotion had been stripped from the scene.  Comparably much of the emotion in the HPB have been changed or stripped when transfered to the movie.  I believe this has more to do the with the director than the actors.  It just seems to me that the Harry Potter movies have become a hollow shell of what made the books so popular.
B001FBJUKE|4.0|For years, my reaction to anyone who claimed this was their favorite punk album was to assume they'd never heard it. Maybe they had a Sid Vicious t-shirt and a Green Day CD. Why? I was 14 when I first heard Anarchy - Radio Luxembourg had an interview with the band right after the Bill Grudy TV show. They played Anarchy three or four times and I Wanna Be Me twice. Visceral, blistering and exciting. I wanted to tell everyone I knew about this band, these songs. When God Save The Queen was released, the local record store had one copy and I stood there for hours hoping they'd play it a second time. Oh, and that b-side! No Fun....Pretty Vacant made Top of the Pops, but the initial thrill was gone.     Then Bollocks came out. Cajoled a tape from a friend's older brother. Rush home. Oh Dear. Far and away the best moments were the singles I'd already heard. Apart from Submission, nothing else was as good as No Fun or I Wanna Be Me. Much, much worse. Dull. Being 15, I loved Bodies. He was angry! He was cussing! He was venomous. Apart from that, I was deeply disappointed. Stomach ache disappointed. Listen-to-it-again-hoping-it's-better disappointing. And that was that. Until I was 17 and outgrew the shock value of Bodies. Poor Johnny Rotten wasn't yet ready to deal with the personal. Oh, and around this time they sang a song called \\"Belsen Was a Gas\\". Yeah, after Glen Matlock they were nothing. Complete and utterly worthless. Irrelevant.     25 years go by and I listened to Bollocks again. Blown Away by the singles, Submission now my favorite, Seventeen moving up the list. Even Holidays sounds better. Steve Jones impresses throughout; Lydon's petulant, angry, paranoid squaling raises the hair on my neck (oh, how I wish Bodies had a point of view...); the drummer appears competent. It's best thought of as a Greatest Hits package. The short, sharp, shock of the first three singles no longer overwhelms the album. Worth buying, worth listening to. If you missed the singles as they came out, and this was the first time you heard them, it's a terrific album, despite some clunkers like EMI and New York.     Oh, and revolution aside. It's now available everywhere even in an Eco-Friendly Package.     John Lydon would move on to create one of the all time best albums with PIL Metal Box/Second Edition. Finally he got the personal and broader politics right.Perfectly right. Challenging and brilliant. Justified belief inhis warped intellect. Tragically, that was it. Was he replaced by a less intelligent twin? Who knows.

B0019LY5IM|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen on TV in some time.  It is refreshing to watch a series that is not based on doctors, lawyers, forensics or cops with same old ideas and stories - just different characters.  This will give you different adventures show after show.  Even if some of the ideas is way out there - it kicks back with something amazing and intense.       If you are going to watch Season 5, you will have to watch the other 4 seasons beforehand.  Or you too will be LOST!!  This is an ongoing and continuous story.  There will only be 6 seasons to this show and the final one is coming on ABC Feb 2nd so you will not have to wait too long to finish out the entire series.  It is well worth it!!

0385504225|2.0|On a positive note, the subject matter was interesting and some historical facts in it were fun.  The scientific facts were very interesting and the symbology was fascinating.  Having said that, this book was a huge let-down!  I LOVED DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons was at least plausible (most of it) but the story line itself of THE LOST SYMBOL is completely unbelievable.  The main villain in this story is absurd, I think a high school student could come up with something better.  Most of the time, I was turning the page hoping it was going to get better.  And most of the time, I was saying \\"Oh, come ON!\\" and was just amazed that Dan Brown would put his name on this book.  What happened?  He needs to fire his editor and anyone else that had a hand in this crap!  If I was Mr. Brown, I'd be embarrassed!  If it comes out in a movie, I don't even know that I'd watch it, especially if they follow the storyline because its completely unbelievable!  Dan Brown is assuming that his readers are idiots.  Anyone that reads books today implies some level of intelligence; a level that Dan Brown did not meet in his latest book.  I was sorely disappointed, after being excited.  I was amazed I made it through the book.  It had alot of parts in it that were completely unnecessary... Literary fluff. I felt insulted as a reader to think I would buy such a poorly-turned story.  Really, if you're a Dan Brown fan and want to stay that way? Don't bother! Seriously!
0345479092|2.0|I read this book cover to cover and I would skip this one!  This book is not very supportive of breastfeeding and her advice is terrible - example- She tells her reader that women should wash off their breasts before nursing!  the sleep advice is OK, but if you miss the \\"window of opportunity\\" you are screwed!  Following her advice just made us terribly frustrated.  Read Weissbluth's \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" instead-  Much better advice, based on science, it works, and the author is not condescending (Luv??  Ducky??)!
0553385461|4.0|I read the book A Briefer History of Time by Stephen Hawking. At first I thought this book might be rather dull, but I actually really enjoyed it and would give it 4 out of 5 stars. In this book, Stephen Hawking brilliantly describes complex concepts of physics relating to the earth and its place in the universe and the theories that attempt to make sense of it all; and he does so in a way that is easy for people inexperienced in physics to understand. The title of this book describes the book really well, as it briefly explains subjects such as relativity, quantum gravity, and even goes into the possibilities of time travel and teleportation. Hawking also gives a lot of history of the study of physics and even devotes a chapter of this book to each Newton, Galileo, and Einstein.  It amazed me how much each of these scientists was able to discover and accomplish, especially with technology far inferior than that of physicists today.  I also really liked the fact that in this book, Hawking supports both the belief in God and the belief in science.  He explains that though natural laws exist and everything happens in natural ways, God is the creator of everything and is omniscient, and therefore could have created these laws and created everything to follow these laws.  I am really glad that I chose to read this book and was not scared away by the fact that it was written by Stephen Hawking, one of the most brilliant men alive.I really felt like I learned a lot from this book and was able to gain a greater appreciation of the universe in which we live and the laws that govern it.   Hawking's simple style of writing in this book makes an enjoyable read for anyone with an interest in how the universe started, how it exists from day to day , and how (or if) it will end.
B001NLKT60|2.0|\\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" was riveting.  It created the unlikeliest heroine, Salander, a quirky cerebral character, who eventually showed signs of warmth.  If we didn't understand her we were attracted to her.  Blomkvist was an interesting if flawed main character and the way the two lives intersected halfway thru the novel made for fascination.  However, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\" was soooo violent, and Salander is shown reacting violently to everything, tho of course she is on the side of right.  Her character is not fully developed and if you'd not read the first novel you might not understand or even like her. The violence was just too much.  I would highly recommend the dragon tatoo but would suggest you stay away from this unless you thrive on gratuitious violence.

It is a book that show you how to open yourself to all the things around, and changing the way you are in the world. It has both the artistic thinking and logical thinking. it was well balanced and full of get moving stories. the biggest problem in the book is that there are parts that are hard to understand and grasp on to. But i know in time i will grasp onto the ideas as i continue to expand my thinking.  It's Obvious the owners never read it, because how could you give up on a book that shows you how to be an all around better person.
B000ZELISO|4.0|I had difficulties with the Bluray disk.  Ultimately I had to download a firmware upgrade (version 2.1) for my early generation Samsung P-1400 player.  Since my player is not connected to the internet, the download was made to a CD and then to the player.  I had trouble with the unzip function and then with transferring the upgrade file to the CD.  The first two attempts produced a CD unrecognizable by the player.  Through trial and error I produced a CD that worked with the player. The actual upgrade took place smoothly with instructions on the TV screen.  The final result allowed me to play the movie but the limitations of the P-1400 could not give me access to all the features of the three disks in the Bluray edition.  Also the effect of dark shading and other artistic aspects of the film diminished the full effect of the 1080p screen image.  I recommend that buyers of the Bluray version who have older players take the time to download the latest firmware updates from their player's manufacturer and install them before taking an hour or so trying to make the Bluray work or to returning them to Amazon.<br /><br />The negative and positive reviews here of The Half Blood Prince are generally valid depending on what the reviewer expected.  The film's limitations were dependent upon the complexity of the book and the time limitations for a feature film.  Much of The Half Blood Prince is dependent upon the viewers' knowledge of the books and previous Potter movies.  As such,  The Half Blood Prince does not do well as a stand alone feature film.  I am sure time limitations also caused numerous scene deletions and compromises with the story line.  Nonetheless, this movie provides a thoroughly enjoyable next installment in the Potter series.  All of the actors provided excellent performances.  Humor and comic relief were provided by the coming of age mishaps of Potter and crew in an otherwise moody and somber story.  I think the directors could have emphasized suspense more as opposed to fear and the dark mood.  All this being said, go ahead buy and enjoy the Bluray edition of Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince.posed to fear and the dark mood.

The prologue, about Carl & Ellie's life together completely made me fall into tears, it was that beautifully done. And then my husband watched it with me, and it was a tissue-fest, because we hope to be like that in our twilight years.<br /><br />The DVD is jam-packed with nifty stuff. Very nifty stuff. The extra short, Dug's Special Mission, is very touching as well, as well as laugh-out-loud funny. The behind the scenes look at making Up was very informative and interesting, and explanations on why some choices were made, and others cast aside, were quite reasonable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good story, or who appreciates excellent animation. The DVD menus were easy to follow and the packaging wasn't stupid (giving the hairy eyeball towards the Wall-E special edition with the pull-out sleeves... bah!).<br /><br />Good product.

0553381687|5.0|It is difficult to describe George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire without giving too much away. However, a reader who's looking into reading this series will probably already know who dies by the end of the first book, and has probably heard about the high character death toll in the series. It's all true, if a little exaggerated: most (and I emphasize most) of the likeably heroic characters are still standing by the end of the most recent book.<br />What makes the series worth reading, however, is getting inside those characters' heads and traveling with them as they take their long, hard journeys through love and war, through hatred and intrigue, through suffering and through joy.<br />A Song of Ice and Fire is the story of war: not one war, but several, in regions far removed from each other, though the tale builds ever closer to uniting the separate threads. Told from the perspective of knights and kings, the sufferings of peasants are only touched on, in a way that makes the reader view the story from the perspective of the nobles in power, though enough is seen of the sufferings of small folk to make the reader see Westeros as a fully developed world. The reader soon learns that that world is a world of ruthless political scheming, sexual depravity, violent insanity, and truly nightmarish supernatural intrigue, existing side by side with moments of awesome victory and lingering hope. It is a world both full of good and full of evil, with one often leading to or feeding into the other: an epic scene of a character's promotion to a position of command could never happen without the merciless slaughter of his predecessor. The Stark children would not be running for their lives in faraway regions if not for their father's unsuccessful attempt to foil a deadly, dangerous plot. That is part of the message of the story: that good often leads to evil, and evil sometimes leads to good.<br />Though large and intimidating in appearance, the several thousand pages zip by at a heart-racing roller-coaster pace, leading readers waiting impatiently for the next installment.heart-racing roller-coaster pace, leading readers waiting impatiently for the next installment.

It definitely has a plot throughtout the years.
B00000IREA|4.0|Man movie, corny, cheap sets, corny story lines. Along the lines of Quest for Fire.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|By focusing on food this movie goes behind the curtain of Oz to lift the veil and reveal a privitized government of, for, and by corporations. In the food industry they literally own the patent rights to the seeds(read Seeds of Destruction by William F. Engdahl). They(a few monopolies) own the whole food process from seeds to the supermarkets/restaurants. Not only do they own the govrnments regulators/they are the government regulators, not only in the food industry, but the banking industry, the pharmaceutical, the media, you name it/it's been privitized to monopoly ownership. Even the U.S. Government has been privitized through a lobbied/corporate media electoral 2-party dictatorship.  This movie is unfortunately just the tip of the titanic ice berg that is not melting but ready to produce another titantic \\"bubble\\" called \\"Cap and Trade\\".    Tune In & drop out of the mainstream propaganda and start reading from a variety of sources. The more mainstream/government, the more suspect.    By virtue of the fact that this movie has been made and distributed widely speaks of the real hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel. The more that people search for that light the more there will be for us all. Truth may be slow, but it is more powerful than the privitized lie. The Public may be Privitization's enemy # 1, but the truth is racing to beat...monpolies/oligopolies lies that race around the world many times over before truth can even tie it's shoe strings.     HIGHLY RECOMMENDED !!!!!     P.S. \\"The glory which is built upon a lie soon becomes a most unpleasant incumbrance. How easy it is to make people believe a lie, and how hard it is to undo that work again!\\" - Mark Twain
B002NXSRVG|4.0|Are you a child of the 80s?  Did you grow up watching transformers and GI Joe?  Then this is an extension of your childhood into adulthood.  Though the characters do not have the same costumes as the cartoons, you cannot fault them.  You have to love this movie.  Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow kick ass...and Scarlet and the Baroness...WOW.
0385504225|3.0|I'll willingly go anywhere Dan Brown wants to take me in his books. I have no issue with the way he takes a kernel of truth and weaves an interesting and explosive story. I don't really care whether Jesus had children or the Pope is part of some great conspiracy or the Masons have secrets; I just like a good yarn.  This story had the potential to be dynamite, but was only so-so. The sense of urgency that kept you turning the page in DaVinci Code and Angels and Demons just wasn't there. I can't put my finger on why. Even so, I was willing to play along. However, a  strange  and improbable plot twist at the very end had me sighing with disappointment and scratching my head. I won't spoil it for others. I can only say that this was not Brown's finest book.
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|It pains me to write this, but this book was awful.  I've waited for Dan Brown's next installment for what seems like forever.  I bought a copy as soon as the bookstore opened on its release date, blasted through the first 300 pages, then realized, &#34;I'm not enjoying this.&#34;  The Langdon character mimics Tom Hanks' portrayal much more than previous literary installments.  The controversial noetic science is simply boring and can't stand up to the captivating nature of the cutting-edge religious fodder of the previous Langdon books.  I had the highest hopes of reading the next great Dan Brown book.  What I got was a sell-out, published for the sake of piggybacking off the success of two lackluster movies.
B0002O7XW2|4.0|I'm not a real ardent Stephen King fan but have read most of his hugely entertaining  early novels (those published in the 70's and early 80's) and I consider CHRISTINE to be one of his best.  I came across the film version the other day and didn't really mean to watch for more than a few minutes but I was riveted from the opening scenes at a Detroit auto factory in the 1950's where Christine is manufactured to the unsettling final scene. The movie had to condense and combine a lot of material from the book but still remains relatively faithful to King's original plot.  In fact I picked up a copy of the novel again and really enjoyed using it to fill in some of the details the film merely hinted at.  One minor complaint is that the novel CHRISTINE took place in the Pittsburgh suburbs and director John Carpenter changed the movie location to California where it was obviously filmed. The acting from the mostly young and still not particularly well known cast is OK but nothing special.  Music is very cleverly and memorably used throughout the film and really enhances the storyline.  There are some gruesome deaths but the goriest of details are left mostly to the viewer's imagination.  If you enjoy this movie you must read the book!
1401323820|4.0|When I saw this book on Amazon's website, I said to myself, \\"Are you kidding?\\"  And the answer is, of course, yes!  This is not a treatise on world peace or how to feed the poor, it's candy, folks.    That being said, it's chocolate candy, the very best kind.  It is fun, sexy, and just what I'd have expected from my favorite author who I had never read before, Richard Castle.  If you watch \\"Castle\\" on ABC, you'll love it.  And if you don't, but you're a fan of Nora Roberts or Janet Evanovich, you should love it too.  I know I did.
0143039504|4.0|This book is wonderful if you want to experience all of Jane Austen's works in one book. It can be a bit heavy sometimes when trying to read in bed. The book has a beautiful and classy cover that I enjoy, as well. So far, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the only one I've read, and it was wonderful. Can be a bit slow if you're not used to the languege... I suggest a dictionary.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|As this full version of Watchmen is well over 3 hours long it is understandable that commercial constraints required a theatrical cut for uninitiated moviegoers (just imagine the bafflement of those expecting something a bit like X-Men!), but it was cynical and insulting to fans for the studio to release a so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" that is still an incomplete version relative to this \\"Ultimate Cut\\". Can we now safely assume that this is where the buck finally stops and there isnt a \\"Lighting Up Double Chuck Norris With Cheese Cut\\" in the pipeline?    I've been waiting for this Ultimate Cut since before the movie was in the cinema, and have not watched the Watchmen in any other version, as having read the comic I wanted to see Snyder's full uncompromised movie interpretation.    Was it worth the wait? Well, as I've not seen the shorter versions I can't say how it compares with them as a viewing experience; but standing alone it is very impressive - a true labour of love bringing virtually every page of the comic, including the prose, to the screen. A film of considerable length and girth - be prepared to use the pause button or double-cross your legs to make it all the way through in one sitting. Tales of the Black Freighter, spliced into the film in this edition, is just fantastic, and the problem of how to handle Under The Hood is solved brilliantly as an extra feature on disc 2 in the style of an 80's tv chat show, complete with commercial breaks. Like the comic, there is amazing detail in the props & backgrounds that will reward revisiting, for example the airships that hang like bombs over New York (and now edge inexoroably closer towards the World Trade Centre like 9/11 in slow motion).    If this had been the first time an Alan Moore comic had been made into a film I wonder if he would have a much higher opinion of Hollywood than he does now as a result of the defilement of some of his other works (although I must say I liked V for Vendetta even if he hated it). So, as anyone interested in this Ultimate Cut probably already knows, Ozymandias's plan is different in final detail to the comic, but its purpose and effect is the same; and in my judgement over-all there are more parts of the film that are absolutely faithful to the comic than there are parts that deviate from it. And, dare I say there was at least one deviation that I consider an improvement over the comic - the scene where Rorschach recounts the incident with the child killer - as the comic's version always struck me as a blatent rip-off of the demise of the Toe-Cutter in Mad Max.    I would give 4.5 rather than 5 stars because I am reviewing the product as well as the film, and in an Ultimate Edition I would have hoped for a menu on disc 1 where I can choose to watch any of the 3 cuts of the film or just the complete Black Freighter on its own, all in HD, as the content is all there on one disc and it is surely just a matter of the order in which the player strings it together. Instead we just get a low definition \\"digital copy\\" of the theatrical cut on a seperate disc. While this should save the inconvenience of having to rip and recode the movie in order to watch it on a low resolution portable device why cant we watch the full-length version we paid extra for? Battery life?    To anyone in the UK thinking of importing this version which is currently unavailable in our green and pleasant land: The Bluray plays happily on a standard unmodified UK PAL Playstation 3, and presumably any other UK player. BUT unfortunately Amazon.com will write the price of the product on the outside of the parcel, which means the Royal Mail will hold the parcel at your local depot until you turn up to pay import duty, and additionally a Royal Mail administration charge which is in excess of the import duty (and they have the audacity to go on strike for more money!). Amazon are not liable for any of that and there is no facility to pay it up-front, so you are looking at an inconvenient trip to the depot and quite a bit extra to pay over the apparent checkout price; but it is still a lot cheaper than buying the UK versions of the director's cut and the theatrical cut and tales of the black freighter and the motion comic seperately, which is all essentially included in the Ultimate Cut along with even more content.
1416575464|4.0|I have a semi-professional interest in design and a very large collection of interior design books, but my husband has never looked through any of them with anything but cursory interest...until he saw this one. \\"It's quite good this\\", he said, which is high praise indeed from a Yorkshireman.     The Domino book is unusual because it features homes with normal (ie small) domestic proportions, is full of images that include unremarkable furniture from multiple periods (ie how real people live, with a mixture of scavenged, inherited and bought bits and pieces, not an array of expensive \\"design classics\\"), and solves practical problems (a baby's bedroom that doesn't look like Toys R Us; what to do if your dining table is not to your taste but too good to give away).     As another reviewer has mentioned, the book has a great double page spread in each section which uses key images to help you define your style, so you can choose furniture and fittings accordingly.     Finally, because the 1930s and 1940s were the golden age of American building, there are also some excellent ideas for kitchens and bathrooms of that period. No UK designer seems remotely interested in the humble interwar semi, and so there is a real lack of styling information for people wanting to avoid wholesale modernisation - amazingly, this US import could be just the job to help fill the gap.     I have taken one star off because the featured interiors do favour a very distinctive style, loosely summarised as \\"colourful/eclectic/timeless\\" - this is very much my own taste, but may be a little too hokey and feminine for some readers.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I saw this movie at the Disney Studio in 3D, I have a profound hearing loss but  the story was so well written that I could follow it without the dialog. The animation was so great that I could actually lip read some of the characters some of the time. The DVD was great because I got the captions and could follow the story even better. Blu-Ray is great, it's like seeing the movie in a mini theatre, I only wish that Disney would have released this disc in 3D.
B000068NOV|5.0|Ertl always delivers and spare no details. Included with this model are the flux capacitor, Mr. Fusion, and the time circuits to let you know where you were, where you are, and where your going. Ertl also added the bonus of flipping a switch to make the wheels pop out and simulate the Hover conversion as seen in Back To The Future 2. For added detail Ertl even made the the doors open straight up and the hood open backwards to reveal the trunk deck. The car is flawless and made from high quality brushed metal to recreate the original Delorean stainless steel finish.<br />I recommend this model for the collector or kid that enjoyed the movies.
B002PMV9FG|2.0|My son and I just re-watched Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince.  We had seen it in the theater over the summer and I had forgotten just how disappointing this movie was.  There were many, many important details that were left out from the book and an entirely new scene was inserted that made absolutely no sense.  This movie should've been split into two like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows will be.  Since we are supposed to be getting clues as to Voldemort's past, the first and most important clue was left out of the movie!  The scene that is missing is how Tom Riddle Sr. met Voldemort's mother and how Voldemort ended up in the orphanage in the first place, and also how Voldemort came to be in the possession of the first horcrux.    The scene that really outraged me was the Christmas scene at the Weasley House.  If the writers of the script had been paying attention to \\"A History of Hogwarts\\" they would have known that the Weasley's house could not be destroyed like that because it is protected with charms just like Hogwarts is.  In addition, since the characters use the Weasley's house as a safe haven in both book 6 and 7, this scene is utterly ridiculous.  There is, however, a nice moment between Dumbledore and Harry in which Dumbledore realizes that Harry is actually the 8th Horcrux.      I also disliked how the director leached the color out of nearly every scene.  The Harry Potter movies have always been a visual feast, rich with color and detail, but as the story has grown darker, so have the movies - literally.  I miss the splendid colors of the first four movies.    I bought this movie in Blue Ray to complete our set, but it will probably be the Harry Potter movie I will be the least likely to re-watch.
0307454541|3.0|I'm not sure why this novel is so wildly popular.  The plot took forever to unwind and was somewhat predictable at the end. I've read worse, but I had a hard time connecting to the two main characters, who were not find particularly sympathetic. The author seemed more interested in describing the brand names and peripherals of the computers the characters used than in believability.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I viewed this Finnish film (overdubbed tastefully with English) with my wife and children a few hours ago, and it is my opinion that this is one of the best Christmas movies I have ever seen, though I confess I've never been much on Christmas movies, aside from the traditional cartoons like Rudolf, Frosty, etc. This movie has a much different slant from most of the holiday movies in that it is not so unbelievable as most (until the end).<br /><br />It should be known that if you watch the film with kids, this movie is not simply a happy-go-lucky \\"Merry Christmas\\" sort of film, but starts off with tragedy, ends with melancholy, and has many moments of emotional intensity throughout. My wife and I both were moved to tears a few times, though it did not seem to have quite as much of an effect on my two small children (ages 9 and 7). It certainly wasn't traumatic to them in any way, but it may have caused them to be thoughtful of how fortunate they are, and to reflect on the preciousness of close relationships.<br /><br />I would recommend this to any family with children, without regard to religion, since no religious component is promulgated. It is simply a lovely little film.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|it is the greatest comic adaptation of all time everyone and anyone should watch this amazing picture if your a fan of the batman or not its just outstandind every aspect of this film well leave you amazed a must watch film for any age anyone: a movie like this only comes every few decades.

0743298039|4.0|If you love Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, you will also be enthralled by the Thirteenth Tale.  The tone of the novel is very much \\"Jane Eyre-esque.\\"  The novel takes place in the dark and dreary moors of England in large mansions with secret wings and \\"ghosts.\\"  The famous author but notorious recluse, Vida Winter, calls upon a young biographer, Margaret Lea, to document the author's life story.  Not trusting the accuracy of Vida's account, Margaret is determined to uncover the truth of Vida Winter's life.  As Margaret searches through Vida's clouded and hidden history, she uncovers dark truths about Vida's past and in doing so she learns to address the ghosts of her own past.    Verdict:  Certainly Diane Setterfield is no Bronte, but she has produced a brilliant novel that harnesses the appeal of the Victorian Gothic novel.  The Thirteenth Tale is a fabulous novel that I recommend to anyone who loves Jane Eyre.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I am confident to say that North by Northwest and Vertigo are two of the best and more personal films made by Alfred Hitchcock. With that in mind, I was quite pleased to see that Warner did a very careful, 8K resolution, transfer of the original negatives, for the Blu-Ray edition.    I can only hope that this release may have some sort of influence on Universal, to do the same. Most of Hitchcock's catalogue belongs to Universal, including those films whose negatives have already been restored. These are films that any movie buff will miss, in hi-def format.    As far as North by Northwest is concerned, this is, without a doubt, the best home video version ever, a must for film collectors and hi-def enthusiasts.
B001CLG6RC|5.0|Although this product came from a European Source, delivery was within days of purchase. I would highly recommend this product and service.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|For film buffs it is not necessary to talk about Frank Capra, or its importance in film history, aesthetics or language. But since this film has had several home video incarnations, it is important to point out one that has made justice to the original negative and soundtrack.    This new edition also includes a colourized version, but no one is obliged to see it. Why would Paramount include such a version, with this kind of picture, is beyond my comprehension. Given that colourization emphasises colour distortion, especially on the actors' faces, and since the movie itself was never intended for colour photography, it is somewhat difficult to understand why anyone would like to see the film in this version. But, since the original is still there, no harm is done.    Undoubtedly, \\"It's a wonderful life\\" is the best Capra film ever made. No matter how many times we have already seen it, it is still impossible not to keep as part of anyone's film library, now in the best video format possible.
1416550542|3.0|I agreed with the positive reviews of other readers, but did find the book sometimes a little too disjointed. While telling the story from different perspectives over different times can be very effective, I found it jumped around a little too much for my taste.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|I love this video. Great performance. She's such a great performer live. Hands down this is a must own.
B000MGVCFY|5.0|In my estimation this is one of three masterpieces by The Moody Blues, with the other two being Days of Future Past and On the Threshold of A Dream. I'd put Blue Jays (Hayward/Lodge) up there too. I've had these albums in Vinyl, CD, The box set Time Traveler and now I'm getting some of the Hayward/Lodge years collection as SACDs. This is what people are looking for from artists that put out this classic material. Especially ones that released Quad mixes back then that we can enjoy now in high resolution, discrete multi-channel formats. I hope more classic artists follow this lead. Some are and they're tapping into a waiting market. Seventh Sojourn's SACD has a quality multi-channel mix that reveals a listening experience that otherwise would have been missed. I highly recommend this SACD edition for fans of The Moody Blues or fans of Classic Rock that stands apart from the rest.
B0024RIMBG|5.0|This is a fabulous DVD. I am planning to buy the CD of this same title to carry with me. Wish I had discovered Celtic Woman a few years ago, but I'm enjoying them fully now!!
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|The Incident is a solid, very proggy and very long album. A little less metal than the band has been recently, and fairly ambitious, spanning two discs. The first disc lasts about an hour and is a single song cycle appropriately called \\"The Incident\\", broken into 14 tracks that do overlap quite a bit. There are only about six tracks that last long enough to develop their own identity, with the others bridging the gaps, developing some sounds and ideas, and providing breathers. Riffs and entire verses can pop up repeatedly in various places, and there's a real cohesive feel to the whole thing without it seeming like one long song usually.    The second disc is fairly divorced from the first, being about EP length and tacking on four more songs to the whole thing's running time. Honestly, I thought it would have been better served as its own separate release. The whole thing lasts roughly 80 minutes with both discs, and I kind of lose interest by the time the first part is over. I could just listen to them separately on my own, but I'm kind of a stickler about listening to entire albums when I play music, and the second disc just drags. It's not bad, it's just too much. Still, it's hard to dislike anything on this record. I won't bring up individual songs because there's not much point - if you've listened to them you know what to expect, and if you don't then I won't do a good job of explaining them anyway. I prefer this band when they make more traditional albums instead of this longer-winded, more conceptual stuff, but it's still all right.
B002LL13AM|3.0|Pollini is nearing the end of his career, and this CD is nearly a post-mortem. For decades I've been a great fan of his, but this is one CD to avoid.<br /><br />His playing lacks life, fervor, and energy; and, for the first time that I can recall, he hums and sings while playing. This is more than annoying and it's simply unacceptable. Gould was able to pull it off because of his sheer brilliance. Brilliance of the type Pollini is capable of is in short supply here.<br /><br />Or, buy this and sing along. Your choice.
B00169N0BK|5.0|This is my first calibrator so I may not know if this rivals other more expensive brands or not but it seems to work well. Installation and set up is very easy with the program that comes with it. The monitor and printer profile that I made seemed spot on to me.

B00138GZJS|4.0|I really wanted to listen to this album,since its one of her more widely known albums. Since i watched The Way we were i listened to that album and bought this album from a packet of her albums(some kind of download deal!). Anyway, the album starts of slow and boring,but then picks up from there. I really like Come On rain or Shine, No more tears is a dance classic.I also really liked. Niagra. There's a little bit of everything, and its one of streisand's more stronger commercial albums. With evidence and her surprise choice to do a duet with Donna Summer. Who im sure at the time was red hot. Streisand usually doesnt do too much pop stuff, and this album is the closest she'll come. If your a fan of good vocals, then you shouldnt overlook this cd. It's actually surprisingly good. It may be dated, but at times it doesnt even sound dated. I would suggest this album if your fan of good singing.
1416955070|5.0|This book was very intriguing and very suspenseful to the max....I say it was better than the \\"Twilight\\" saga well...maybe just a bit in my opinion. Anyways it was very well written it keeps you wanting to read more and more to find out what is going to happen next for Clary and Jace. p.s. I was sooo....obsessed about reading the book that I didn't even sleep that much because I couldn't put the book down.
1416594787|5.0|This book and author kneel in front of the nude body of Satan and pay oral homage, and it sort of punches Jesus in the face. But I'm giving it 5 star anyhow because it made me laugh. How exactly do animals change into other animals? There is no proof, yet Dawkins promotes the big Lie by making up evidence that contradicts what people like me already believe.     Dawkins should ask himself:    1) If evolution is true, how come Asian people always have Asian babies rather than some kind of evolved post-Asian baby. The baby always has the same number of arms and legs as the parents! It never has gills or protective spikes on its head or any of the other features that evolution supposedly creates, this shows it is false.    2) If evolution is true, why did we evolve to think it's not true? Why do me and my friends not believe it, when we evolved too supposedly. Evolution is pretty stupid if it creates people who don't believe it.    3) If evolution is true, God's word is not true. God's word is true, so evolution is not true and Darwin lied.    4) If evolution is true, it means that all animals and humans were born from other animals. But God impregnated the Virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit, who blew through her orifice and planted a God-baby, so that means evolution is false. If I were to accept evolution, I'd have to accept that Joseph lied on top of Mary's nude body and placed his dingus inside of her, and that's contrary to what I feel like thinking about.    For all of these reasons, Dawkins and his ilk mess up our faith with their facts and bring hot devil love to us, reject them and stay true to Jesus.
B0011NVC9I|1.0|Okay, I am not a huge fan of the original poem, but the movie was far worse than the story I remember. They really should have called it something else, because this was not the story of Beowulf. Also, the change of Grendels' mother from a monster to a sex goddess with built-in stilettos really killed the movie for me; I really don't think that was meant to be funny, but I couldn't help but laugh out loud. Maybe if I hadn't read the original story, I would have seen the story in a new light, but that's not the case here. Rent the movie and decide for yourself, but be careful if you ever sit through this movie with a group of English majors...although it does make for an interesting get together. lol.
0553385461|4.0|Stephen Hawking's book,  A Briefer History of Time, is a very well written teaching on the basics of the universe that deserves a 4 star rating.  It does an excellent job of teaching about the basics of physics and the universe in a very clear, simple, and enjoyable way.  Those with little or no previous knowledge of either subject will not only gain a greater understanding of the world around them, but will also find it rather enjoyable.  Too often scientists bore their audience with big words or try to make everyone else excited about some strange detail that no one other than the author cares about.  Hawking never makes you feel uncomfortable or stupid.  He avoids using any math or equations to explain the principles.  In the introduction, Hawking says that the purpose of the book is to answer the questions, \\"What do we really know about the universe?  How do we know it?  Where did the universe come from, and where is it going?\\"  He answers these questions by showing the history of universal thought by many different astronomers and physicists.  He shows how subsequent discoveries changed and built upon the discoveries of yesterday.  Although he never makes you feel really stupid he never really makes you feel really smart either.  After reading in the book, I felt like I had to know more than I did originally but I couldn't always remember everything I had learned.  There weren't a ton of lightbulbs going off in my head that made this book particularly memorable.  Anyone interested in learning a lot may want to look at another boo   There were a few parts of the book that were a little boring.  I thought the discussion on relativity was really dry and seemed really long.  He might have done better by sharing more information.  By making it so simple, sometimes I was left with questions about how it worked.  The topics such as time travel and black holes were a lot more interesting.  Some other topics covered include quantum mechanics, scientific theory, and thebasics of Newton's Gravity theory.    If you want to learn a lot about physics, you may want to look for a more complete source, but if you want to feel like you understand a little more about what's going on the universe, then you've found the right book.

B000002IZ4|5.0|This album was released on the back of STP's successful debut album 'Core', and is in many respects similar. The guitars are slightly less heavy and more tuneful, but over-all the recognizable Stone Temple Pilots sound remains. Although not a classic, or as good as their debut, hits such as 'Big Empty' and 'Meat Plough' are great songs.

The harder and fast numbers grab you first (Dance, Drive me crazy, Body talk) but then the slower ones shine through after a few listens and become even more enjoyable - best of these are 'One good lover, Slip of the lip, It doesn't matter & Take a chance', great melody from start to finish. We must remember rock and roll is supposed to be fun and not taken seriously.
0312539517|4.0|This is a well written book and if you do not know the incredile story of Mallory, this is a good PRIMER. I first learned about Mallory through the speech in 1925 at the RGS. That is not part of this book. WHAT A PITY!      Having said that, Jeffery Archer is a good writer and the book is interesting and a fun read.
B00000DFTG|5.0|This is a great live album from the original masters of heavy metal.The concert is complete from their second night at the NEC Birmingham, England . If you are a metal fan buy this and listen to the original metal band . There are also two new songs at the end studio recordings what shows what might be if they ever record a new album.
0812979656|5.0|It is rare that one comes across a writer with the intense word power as Arundhati Roy. \\"The man with her leaves no footsteps in the sand and no ripples in the water. He is the God of Small Things.\\"  This highly acclaimed book has been reviewed and revered by so many that it is difficult to find anything new to say about it.  The lyrical quality of the author's style so truly comes from a searing intelligence that is unsurpassed in contemporary literature.  Roy has a strong sense of justice that is not masked by the fiction genre.  She knows how to tell a story in a straight-forward fashion the rings through the mind and bores into the heart.  This is a book that will stay with the reader long into the night....long after the final page has been read and the book closed.
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads is one of the most highly praised guitarists in the Metal genre. His mix of Classical and contemporary guitar styles, which now seems clichéd, was a truly original and genuinely outstanding skill. This live record serves as testament to his ability. To some extent, he sounds even better than he did on his albums with Ozzy. Not forgetting Ozzy; for all the controversy of his actions of the 1980s  it is surprising to hear his talent in a live format.
0307455874|5.0|I am reminded of when Joe Biden was derided for calling Barack Obama \\"articulate\\" and \\"clean,\\" yet that characterization kept crossing my mind as I read, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\".  I found Barack Obama's writing style easily accessible  but was taken by how, even then, he was expression of a general change, not the product of a star system. No hocus pokus. Down to earth. Genuine.  Obama deserves praise for inspiring  us to believe we can do better by force of will. We need hope.  Barack Obama has restored that very concept.
B002UXRH10|4.0|Rated R, that is so right, with the amount of swearing that Rihanna does on this album, she clearly is no longer singing for the young kids.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of the pop Rihanna, I prefer when she was the island girl on her first CD however I must say that this album is pretty good. She's taken on a different persona, she's clearly a gangsta chick now and for some reason it works for her.<br /><br />She has that bad girl side to her that is actually believable and I like it.  Wait is Ova, Hard and G4L show that gangsta side while Stupid in Love and Photographs showcase her softer side.<br /><br />My favourite song has to be Rude Bwoy as this goes back to her island days and she definitely comes on point with this song.<br /><br />I would love if there was no swearing, the F-Bombs on the album are unnecessary.
B000YDDUKA|5.0|I have the 1999 remastered version of this CD, which is a large improvement over the 1990 version.  Starting with the title track through Lyin' Eyes, the improvements seemed more distinctive than the final four tracks, but all sound very \\"clean\\": a wide range of audible frequencies, while still filtering out any hiss and any other limitations of the original, analog master.  The ambiance of the recordings are preserved very well, and I can feel as if I am in the studio with the guys, listening to some of the instruments: Don Henley's hi-hat tapping stands out much better on the title track, as do his crash-cymbals that and other tracks; Randy Meisner's bass stands out better, without overwhelming the other instruments.  The latter is important, since most low-frequency instruments--if I'm not mistaken--received emphasis of dynamics starting about the time that this album was recorded.  There are many other instrumental highlights, but those--as the rhythm section--are imperative to preserve.  The guys' vocals stand out well, with good channel separation.  The middle-instrumental section of \\"I wish You Peace\\" seems to grab me in a certain way on a cold, rainy day during the winter holiday season, when I am alone...not sure why!  As advice, for anyone listening to this album with a large number-frequency equalizer: keep the treble sliders higher than the bass, and the middle-frequency sliders roughly in the middle; fine adjustments may be necessary, depending on each song. A good surround-sound receiver (Pro-Logic®/Dolby®) is recommended.  Without further detail, the best of audio equipment (headphones, input output plugs, etc), help make this remaster of OoTN sound excellent!

B0026NWBY2|5.0|For fans of George Harrison and of the Beatles in general, this album is a wonderful stroll through the 35+ year pathways in your mind.  With all the celebration of McCartney/Lennon music, and it is fabulous, it's easy to forget how multi-talented the \\"quiet\\" Beatle was.  And there were a couple of songs I'd never heard, a nice treat among all the terrific standards.
0061537969|2.0|I had liked the idea of a story told through the eyes of a dog, and I do actually like the dog. However, I feel that the poor dog is stuck with a seriously immature, selfish man - and that is what makes the story just plain bad.     I found myself skipping pages constantly in this book. The constant boring racing gibberish was just too much to handle. I'm sorry, but racing is BORING (especially if you're reading about it) and the only one that seemed to be interested in that story was Denny, and his dog. Why Enzo found his master brilliant, I don't know.     I find Eve brilliant -- brilliant because she managed to withstand a brain tumor, while raising a child, paying bills, working and basically providing for her family, while her dumb ass husband was out chasing stupid dreams.     Denny is a loser, and the story should have ended with Eve's parents taking the girl and raising her properly.     I just didn't feel much for this story. I wanted to like it so much, but I think people give this book so many stars based on the idea that it was told by a dog, and how sad and tragic the story is. Tragic doesn't make a story good though.

The vocal duties were shared between Lemmy and Brock.  Simon House replaced Mik, well he kind of replaced him as he wasn't really an effects guy.  He played synthesizer, Mellotron and electric violin.<br /><br />*********Technical Stuff:<br />This is the first Hawk album that was actually recorded and mixed well.  It seems that the only version available now is the 1996 remaster, which is a good thing.  The '96 remasters were all done extremely well, with sound quality as the motivating force.  There is no clipping, squashing, or mastering induced distortions; in short no 'loudness war' bs.  Google or look up 'loudness war' for more info.  So this album sounds really really good.  [edit: I should add 'to me' to that sentence as some have complained about the mild use of noise reduction.  My view on judiciously used NR is that it is no big deal; and sometimes like with noisey 78's, it is a godsend.  But YMMV.]<br /><br />*********The Music<br />While not on the same exalted plane as The Space Ritual, this is still a very good album.  The sound on this album is more psychedelic and more melodic than the previous ones.<br /><br />Keyboardist/violinist Simon House added a orchestral element to the mix.  He helped to bring Hawkwind musicianship up a few levels, while still retaining the ability to seriously rock.  His mellotrons and violins are a definite plus on this album; and are the perfect counterpoint to the Brock/Lemmy/King riffage.<br /><br />\\"Psychedelic Warlords\\" set the stage for the rest of the album.

B00005K3OT|4.0|.... a special genre, a rule unto itself! That's how it tasted to me, anyway ... a pretty confection, like a chocolate-filled eclair, though the chocolate had just a hint of pepper. I might have preferred MORE food, a longer culinary build-up to the birthday feast that becomes the turning-point of the story. It's also a film in the vein of \\"magic realism\\" established by Latin American novelists. One can't help comparing it to \\"Like Water for Chocolate.\\" That comparison does expose the shortcomings of Chocolat: there's not enough of the manic energy, there's nothing quite as funny or as poignant, and the acting isn't half as good. Johnny Depp is more mannequin than Man, more Hollywood pirate than Gallic gypsy. Juliette Binoche plays her role more as Cinderella's Fairy Godmother than as the half-Mayan sorceress she's supposed to be. Only veteran actress Judi Dench shows theatrical savvy -- control of her body, ability to express large emotions with a flicker of her eyes or lips, 'economy' of gesture and posture. She can act!<br /><br />There are quite a few vitriolic one-star reviews of this film. Many of them compare it unfavorably to the book; since I haven't read the book, I can only suppose they have a point, but I don't much care. The film was a sweet treat, the sort of confection it's best to forget you've eaten lest you feel guilty about your waist-line or waste-time. Other reviews denounce the film as being hostile to religion, specifically to conservative Catholicism. They are correct. Vianne, the chocolate-sorceress, is indeed an atheist, though her stance seems mostly gratuitous. Her 'adversary' in the film is not the puppy priest but the repressed, hypocritical Count. Yes, the film can be taken as anti-clerical, and if you are fundamentally an anti-disestablishmentarian, you'd be wise to skip it.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the film is the photography of the village near Toulouse. Yes, dears, there ARE villages in France just as picturesque and unspoiled as that one, and with any luck you'll find a celebrated gourmet restaurant there. Bon app&eacute;tit!ne, and with any luck you'll find a celebrated gourmet restaurant there. Bon appétit!
B001AVCFJM|5.0|- Captain Pike to surly young townie Jim Kirk: \\"Your father was captain of a starship for twelve minutes. He saved eight hundred lives, including your mother's - and yours. I dare you to do better.\\"<br /><br />This is neither your grandpa's Star Trek nor the Trekkies' or Trekkers' traditional Star Trek. J.J. Abram's STAR TREK is instead a reinventing of the classic characters and their universe, and if you could accept that their adventures don't at all undermine past continuity - that this instead is a wholly new and separate continuity, parallel to the old one - then this film might become your Star Trek. It doesn't replace as much as add a new layer to what's gone on before. It certainly revitalizes the franchise.<br /><br />The genesis lies in the original Star Trek universe. Something there happens on a cataclysmic level which then triggers an alternate timeline. In this new reality, James T. Kirk grows up without a father to inspire him, and the malcontent boy grows into a cocky, rebellious young local townie who, the morning after a life-altering bar brawl, enrolls into Starfleet Academy. As the movie unfolds, we learn that while this Kirk may be more bitter and resentful than the original, he's still the same audacious, take-charge Iowan we'd long ago propped on a pedestal. James T. Kirk is still THE man.<br /><br />This ranks among the best Star Trek films, in terms of escapism and of sheer high adventure. It's just a fun movie, and I think a smart move by the franchise's think tank. Most of the actors previously involved with past incarnations of Star Trek are become old fogies, or as near as. New blood was definitely required, and really if one weren't gonna do a Starfleet Academy series, then why not go back to the source but with a new spin? Shatner, Nimoy, and the rest are so linked with the characters they made iconic that, really, a parallel reality was the best route to take. It allows a new generation of actors to have breathing room and to establish their own marks on these same characters. Having said that, I'm very happy that we're treated to an extended cameo by a familiar face from the original universe.<br /><br />J.J. Abrams makes this picture an exhilarating one, and action-packed. Maybe he's saving the more cerebral elements and the human drama for the sequels. But this STAR TREK celebrates the new cast, most of whom are terrific, several seemingly out of left field. There's really nothing to say about Zachary Quinto, other than this whole enterprise (heh) would have collapsed if he weren't around. In looks and demeanor, he does really great interpreting a young Spock. Chris Pine makes all the right choices as the new James T. Kirk. He could've effed this up royally by mimicking Shatner's mannered cadence, except that he mostly stays away from this. Pine puts in his own spin, and yet still captures the same spirit and swagger of the good captain. Once in a while, though, either with a pronounced delivery of a line or with a subtle movement, Pine does channel his inner Shatner, as a homage and just to give us a for old time's sake. This guy won me over quick.<br /><br />Rating the other actors: Karl Urban is the shocking surprise here, and I think he walks away with the best performance. His Dr. McCoy is absolutely spot-on, wonderfully crabby and gruff; he perfectly evokes the mannerisms of DeForest Kelley. I didn't think he had it in him, and I'm digging his chemistry with Chris Pine. Smoking hot Zoe Saldana comes in the room and her fiercely intelligent Uhura is, if anything, even more strong-willed than Nichelle Nichol's. While I enjoyed Simon Pegg and Anton Yelchin's respective versions of Scotty and the 17-year-old Chekov, their performances are juuuust a shade over-the-top. But I just don't see John Cho as Sulu. Maybe it's because I keep waiting for Sulu to go looking for a White Castle. Anyway, the core actors show really good chemistry, and if you check out the special features, you can tell they're having a blast spending time with each other. The future looks very good for upcoming sequels.<br /><br />Another cool thing is that the big crisis is met head on by a group of untested cadets, and this sets up that sense of \\"Wow, they really are starting over.\\" We see the initial interactions of the celebrated Enterprise crew, but again this is a new universe and some things have changed. Just some examples: This movie posits that Kirk and Spock first met thru the infamous Kobayashi Maru incident, and theirs is an instant rivalry. We learn the roots of Dr. McCoy's nickname. And an unexpected romance blossoms.<br /><br />The villains, meh. I'm not ever keen on Romulans as the Big Bad. In relation to Vulcans, Romulans are kind of like those embarrassing relatives you don't talk about, you know, the ones who live on the mountains and generally have a working TV sitting on top of a broken TV. The first appearance of their starship, all bristly and smacking of aggression, is promising and is properly menacing. But then it went downhill once I realized that it was manned by Romulans. It doesn't help that Eric Bana's role of rogue Romulan villain Nero (not cool with that name, either) comes off as underdone and seems to be there just to service the plot.<br /><br />This 2-disc DVD set, the special features: On Disc 1: the filmmakers' nerdy cool commentary (Director J.J. Abrams, Exec. Producer Bryan Burk, Writers/Producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and Producer Damon Lindelof); a gag reel (worth it alone for the final outtake with Pine and Quinto affecting some weird Ikea accent); and the Making Of featurette \\"A New Vision.\\"<br /><br />On Disc 2: \\"To Boldly Go\\" - a segment going even deeper behind the scenes, focusing a bit more on the filmmaking process, as well as the crew's further reflections on classic Trek; in-depth featurettes on the \\"Casting,\\" \\"Aliens,\\" and the \\"Score\\"; nine deleted scenes, some of which do flesh out the story, and all with optional director/producers commentary: \\"Spock Birth,\\" \\"Klingons Take Over Narada,\\" \\"Young Kirk, Johnny and Uncle Frank,\\" \\"Amanda and Sarek Argue After Spock Fights,\\" \\"Prison Interrogation and Breakout,\\" \\"Sarek Gets Amanda,\\" \\"Dorm Room and Kobayashi Maru (Original Version)\\" - this one details just how Kirk cheated on the test, \\"Kirk Apologizes to the Green Girl\\" (funny), and \\"Sarek Sees Spock.\\" Disc 2 contains the STAR TREK D-A-C free game trial for XBox 360 - just pop the disc into your XBox 360 and follow the prompts; and for a digital copy of the film, Disc 2 can also be inserted into your computer's DVD-ROM or BD-ROM drive.<br /><br />Some things never change, nor should they. The core personalities are intact, and this is never more true than the qualities which make Jim Kirk so iconic. The purpose of the Kobayashi Maru challenge is to instill fear into Starfleet officers so that they can accept and prepare for the possibility of defeat. But that philosophy is simply antithesis to the defiant make-up of Kirk's character. In whatever incarnation, Kirk is all about beating the odds. He simply doesn't believe in no-win situations. And another staple of the franchise to survive: When Pike assigns Kirk, Sulu, and some no-hoper named Engineer Olsen on a high risk mission, and then you glimpse Engineer Olsen sporting that red uniform, well, you instantly know his odds for survival just dropped to a big, fat nil. And I guess, in whatever universe, Kirk will end up macking with a green-skinned hottie from Orion. And, oh yeah, as a last desperate bid for survival, the go-to move will always be that old \\"eject the warp core\\" ploy.<br /><br />Now some dubious stuff: I guess the sequence with Kirk as a kid was necessary to demonstrate just how angry he was in his formative years, but, man, this kid was really unlikable. I don't quite buy that Vulcan kids will resort to baiting to test young Spock's devotion to emotionless logic. Vulcans do have emotions, yeah, but I thought they weretoo well trained from the outset to demonstrate such bullying behavior. And it's a bit convenient that Scotty, newly arrived on the Enterprise, would so promptly be put in charge of engineering. It's also stretching things a bit that Kirk would get marooned on an ice planet and then end up meeting... someone. But the fan boy factor is so high on this last one that it's really easy to give it a pass.<br /><br />This may be the funniest Star Trek flick since STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME. The running hypo-spray gag between Bones and Kirk is sweet. And, lastly, a friendly hint to all would be destroyers/conquerors of the universe: dudes, quit messing about with other planets. Just go and hit Earth first. You inevitably end up there, anyway, and then the Enterprise finds a way to dump on you.<br /><br />Apropos of nothing, this flick reminds me quite a bit of Della Van Hise's 1985 Star Trek novel [[ASIN:0671524887 Killing Time (Star Trek, No 24)]], which also features an alternate history, with Romulans as the villains, Kirk a bitter young officer and Spock as the Enterprise's Captain.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|Maybe this is why they still let Woody Allen make films after all those really terrible movies?<br />I hate the voice over narration in this film. A really good film maker lets the<br />action speak for itself?<br />The acting was OK and the Spanish setting was very good,<br />but the subject matter of American women tourists and a Spanish painter<br />just was kind of sexually trite as a subject?<br />It seems every one wants a slightly crazy Latin artist<br />as a lover: some sort of New York status symbol maybe?<br />Real painters and artists are sometimes more practical than businessmen<br />in their life choices ( mostly because they have to be).<br />Still the result is better than the last two Woody Allen films<br />I've seen, but still not up to his classic comedy style.

1595141979|5.0|Shadow Kiss is the third in the Vampire Academy series that focuses on Rose Hathaway, future guardian to Lissa, the last in a line of Dragomir royalty. Rose is dhampir, the offspring of a human and vampire. Lissa is Moroi, a mortal vampire with magical powers (the Strigoi are evil immortal vampires that kill to survive).  Rose is Lissa's Guardian, sworn to protect her at any cost. Her wants and needs come second to Lissa's. Rose and Lissa have been best friends since childhood, and she'd never questioned the cost of giving up her personal life to protect Lissa, but now she's haunted by a growing sense of resentment. After the death of a friend, Rose is troubled by dark thoughts and impulses and her crush on the handsome teacher Dimitri spirals out of control.<br /><br />I hadn't read any of the previous novels in the series before picking up Shadow Kiss, but even so, Mead makes the backstory accessible to new readers. Rose is a captivating narrator, strong-willed and impulsive. Her blossoming relationship with Dimitri is handled tactfully, and provides a sweet counterpoint to the violence that is unleashed upon St. Vladimir's. In many ways, St. Vladimir's presents all of the typical high school drama: cliques, catty remarks, annoying teachers, drunken parties, but with the element of magic and vampiric royalty. It's much more three-dimensional than some other recent vampire young adult fiction. The story is gripping and kept me reading until the last heart-wrenching page, and I rushed out to discover the continuing story in [[ASIN:1595141987 Blood Promise (Vampire Academy, Book 4)]].
B0017PCW62|5.0|Whether you already own the original album or not at all, you need this album. This special edition contains everything from both versions of the original with a little extra. I know a lot of people complain about special editions and remaster versions; however, this one is worth the money if you love this album.  If you have never heard this or anything from this band and you are just starting out then this album along with \\"Slow, Deep, and Hard\\" are a great starting point. Buy It!!!
6304696566|2.0|Watched disc one of this movie for the first time last night and couldn't get into it.  When they start on the search and the young man Martin says: we are going so we can get them back aren't we? He sounds like an 10hr old not an 18 year old, as though repeating a script line he just learned two days ago and couldn't get the emotional intent right.  As the movie progress I kept wondering will this boy ever grow up.      It was highly rated but seemed almost corny in the simpleness of the portrayals.   I'm not a fan of Western's but it struck me how Larry McMrutry's mini-series Lonsome Dove had so much more subtle interplay in personalities and expression of character.   (Lonsome Dove is at its transcendent best in part 1 but gets a little tragic as it continues).   As far as westerns, or American history in drama, I also found Mitchner's Centennial  more riveting.     However I'm sure I'm being unfair.  John Ford was a legendary film maker with vision and conscience.  Very very likely the films we like today were made by people standing on the foundations and creative innovation of those early films and directors.

0307454541|4.0|This mystery is first rate. The translation into English is sometimes a little clunky, but over all the pace is good, and the characterization excellent. The novel combines themes of the importance of a free press and contempt for the ravages of big business. A good, interesting plot line.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This is the first book i have downloaded on my new kindle and i don't think i could have chosen a better one. The writer has captured the essence of love in such a beautifully detailed way.   if you are a romantic at heart this book is for you.  seriously cannot recommend it enough! Only question... When is the sequel coming out???
B0017U7PT6|2.0|Yet another oven-ready gobbler from the modern master of empty spectacle, Roland Emmerich. Not only does the story comprise cliches from every prehistoric-humans film ever made (not to mention an implicit nod to \\"Stargate\\", Aesop's fable of the lion and the mouse, and \\"The Ten Commandments\\"), but there is simply no emotional connection with any of the characters. You really don't give a damn what happens to them. And then there's an absurd \\"geist ex machina\\" ending.<br /><br />Though Emmerich claims to have studied what's known about paleolithic life (he at least gets the pole star right), the principal characters live in a winter wonderland only a few days' walk from appears to be Egypt! That's carrying plate-tectonic theory a bit too far, don'tcha think?<br /><br />The only good thing about the film is the beautiful, seamless, CGI, missing only the piles of poop the wooly mammoths would have left while dragging huge blocks up the ramps.
B002X20W2E|4.0|Will at first when I previewed Rihanna's \\"Rated R\\" album I was kind of disappointed I wanted my next \\"SOS\\" or \\"Umbrella\\" but was given \\"Wait your turn\\" I wasn't feeling it so I said what the heck I'll buy It once a fan always a fan and man I was blown away \\"Russian Roulette\\" was awesome kind of brings you back to \\"Unfaithful\\" and \\"Rude Boy\\" was just like wow she has grown into a more mature artist but \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Hard\\" really show you what she is feeling so for me and every other fan cut this record a break and buy it. O and PS. \\"Wait your Turn\\" is awesome lol.
B002A6JA80|5.0|What do I write about first? That the story of Bobby Sands's hunger strike speaks to human nature's worst and best actions? Or that this is the finest piece of art cinema ever offered to the public? The viewer is brought into the prison, the violence, with barely a word. Only amazing visuals and sounds place us in the scenes. Interviews with director Steve McQueen and actor Michael Fassbender suggest the point of the film is not to be a political film that takes sides in the conflict in N.I., as their intent was to be sympathetic as well as critical of all sides by portraying the situation with realism. And the realism is not for the faint of heart. Beyond the visualization of the hunger strike, I think this film would appeal to anyone who is studying the art of film making because it breaks conventions of Hollywood quick edits, fast pacing, ambitious scores and dialogue-driven plots. Uncomfortably, we are given plenty of time to take in each scene. Often this is beautifully rendered with close-ups and exquisite lighting. Remarkably similar to viewing extraordinary paintings that powerfully communicate our human history.    This version is in PAL format which can be played on computers by changing the region of the dvd player.This is unnecessary if a multi-region dvd player is available.
B000056VIY|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 8th grade. I love this album. It is listenable and danceable. The songs on this album are more personal than before. The songs reflect a lot of what she witnessed sisters and girlfriends going through. They are about relationships,and about having a good time and not having such a good time,or partying a lot and partying too much. This album is a homage to her fans. This album reflects that she has matured not only musically and vocally,but also emotionally as a person, and spiritually. This album has been certified 3x Platinum. Remember,this was 2001-2002.
B002PMV9K6|2.0|This movie is painful to watch. There are many more flaws than even Geoff (another reviewer) points out in his review. I get irritated just by watching it. I thought the first movie was brilliant in every way. The second was very good. Beginning with Azkaban, the movies have gone downhill. I think Michael Gambon, while a fine actor, is horribly miscast as Dumbledore. Where's his twinkling eyes? Where's his mouth twiching when he's amused and trying not to show it? Albus Dumbledore, as we know him in the books, has an almost child-like sense of humor and wonder. Gambon lacks these qualities entirely. The dialogue is terrible. There's almost zero continuity in the film. I agree with Geoff . . this movie is only very loosely based on the book. I bought the DVD because I'm a Harry Potter fanatic and must have all the movies, but I am deeply disappointed.
B002UXRH10|5.0|I really like this album! She has did it again! She is continuing a musical and stylistic journey on this album. This album is going to solidify her global chart dominance while she continues to push boundaries in both music and fashion.  Her music became rougher. She also remained naturally faithful to darling Caribbean themes, yet the beats turned more aggressive and the electric rock-guitar is as tangible as never before. The combination of these forms a kind of angry, juicy electro-pop. This album also is her most personal and emotional.  This album is going Platinum!
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The Hyper 212+ is without a doubt, one of the best coolers for the money on the market. At $29.00 the thing 'hammers' it's competition and dismisses cards costing almost three times as much. The cooler was able to lower my slightly overclocked I7-920@3000MHz to 26 degrees idle and 38 degrees loaded. It is light enough so as not to bend the motherboard and comes with everything needed for installation....including a bolt through kit.
B00005OCMR|5.0|I HEARD IN 2010,THERE'S A SOMEWHAT SEQUEL OR FOLLOW UP TO THIS FILM CALLED \\"TRON LEGACY\\" I'VE SEEM THE TEASER TRAILER BUT IT DOESN'T LOOK THE SAME!

B002PMV9FG|2.0|I heard it once said, if you're going to do a thing do it right, if not, don't do it.  i think i learned that in kindergarten.      if someome didn't read the books and just saw the movies, he/she probably wouldn't have a problen with the film.  but if someone, like me, who did read the books, would.    it was lacking, done in a rush manner.  like the director took the book or script or whatnot, said, cut this, cut, cut with no thought about it. all done, I imagine, to save time and money which is sad and well stupid.  the movie should have been longer or done into two parts.  if it was done longer, granted, people would have complained about sitting on their butts for a 2 1/2 to 3 hour long movie but they would have done it.    the characters from Harry to hagrid were flat--they all seemed to have the look of boredom (or dissapointment) on their faces.  it was like, they came, mumbled their lines and went.  the only thing that was consistent was that it was dark, as it was in the book.       When the movie was done, I was actually relieved.

The truth is they both suffer from an identical delusion, that being, left on their own, people will operate in their long term self interest. The fact of the matter is that, history clearly demonstrates this fantasy to be utterly false.<br /><br />The shortcomings of the socialist state hardly need elucidation but unfettered American capitalism is only slightly better. In my lifetime America has gone from the highest standard of living in the world to number 6. What is the solution? More tax cuts for corporations and the rich. Cut all social programs, repeal government regulations, and more spending for the military industrial complex. Look how well it has worked over the last 50 years.<br /><br />Be it the workers utopia or the capitalist dream state, short term greed and megalomania always trumps long term benefit. Without regulation and over-site, provided by non invested parties, the system degenerates into a morass of carnage and self interest.<br /><br />From LTCM to the Great Leap Forward there is not a single example of the Marx/Friedman agenda working in the long run. The truly frightening thing is there are still those in high places, on both sides, that see it as a matter of incomplete adoption and not failed ideology. In their minds success is a matter of degree. Just a little more bleeding and it will all magically get better!
B002JCSWUW|4.0|How can one not have huge expectations going into INVICTUS - the story of Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) using the Rugby World Cup of 1995 as a rallying point to help unify his troubled post-apartheid country, and forming a bond with the young captain of the traditionally-named (and hated by many blacks) Springboks, Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon)?  Especially when it's directed by Clint Eastwood, whose two previous collaborations with Freeman won Best Picture and Director Oscars for Clint, with Freeman winning a Best Supporting Actor prize for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  And being a huge Clint Eastwood fan who has seen everything he's directed or starred in....well, let's just say there are few films this year that I was looking forward to more.<br /><br />Of course massive expectations - however impossible to avoid - are frequently going to engender disappointment, and such is the case here to some extent - though there is more to like than not overall.  Freeman is just as great as I expected him to be - no, he doesn't sound exactly like Mandela, but he gets the cadences and speech patterns down pretty well, the charm and the moments of boyish impishness, and especially the sense of a troubled, lonely inner life that he has managed through supreme will to tame and use to his advantage.  This Mandela is a man determined to unite a country almost through sheer will, a man willing to be autocratic and domineering when he feels there is no other way, and a man who knows that winning over his enemies is just as important as keeping his friends.<br /><br />Matt Damon's Francois Pienaar is something of a cypher, a seemingly apolitical man interested in little beyond rugby, a leader himself but one who seemingly has even less chance of pulling his team from the brink of disaster than Mandela has of pulling his country up.  What Pienaar needs is confidence and spirit - something the president has in abundance; and what Mandela needs is a rallying point that both blacks and whites can get behind; obviously, in true sports-movie manner, they find each other and clearly couldn't succeed without both putting forth every effort.<br /><br />It's not the sports cliches that are really the problem here; after all, this is based on a true story, South Africa really WAS a giant underdog to win the World Cup, and they really did prevail against all odds.  And it's not Freeman or Damon, or any of the other fine actors; rather it's the shorthand that Eastwood and screenwriter Anthony Peckham use to show the country coming together which lacks substance and feels in the end the most cliched.  The Pienaars have a black maid who keeps quiet through most of the film, but finally gets her moments; the president's bodyguard staff is a mix of blacks and whites who initially distrust and dislike each other, and come to grudgingly respect each other, and so on.  Meanwhile little of the changing nature of the South African people in general is seen over the 5-year timespan of the film, and little of the attitudes of Pienaar's team, the Springboks, to becoming a symbol as much as a rugby team.<br /><br />Still the emotional power of the story does come through, in particular through the deep inner life that Freeman's Mandela manages to convey, a wisdom that understands something about how much more important reconciliation and forward-thinking is than revenge and recriminations.  I can't take credit for this thought, but I will mention that it's interesting how this film, like so much of Eastwood's past work is in a sense focused on revenge; except that in this case, revenge is seen as unambiguously wrong by the protaganist (and by extension, we the audience) and not to be applied.  The demons are exorcised, and we get a truly positive and life-affirming ending - one of the few in the director's entire filmography.  Sure, we all know that South Africa isn't a paradise now, and still has a great many problems; but the promise of someone like Mandela is I think worth holding forth still - even if it is more than a little romantacized.  The fact that 'the whole story' is not altogether well-articulated isn't entirely Clint's fault or the other participants; this is too large a story to be told in one film, one way, and if Eastwood wasn't fully up to the task, his heart was certainly in the project, and I think what he did get right was well worth doing, and seeing.it is more than a little romantacized.

B00000AFFF|4.0|You will not get 1960s hitmaker Burt Bacharach on Painted From Memory, nor vintage Elvis Costello.<br /><br />But you will get a wonderful synergy between these two mature artists. On tracks like \\"Sweetest Punch,\\" \\"God Give Me Strength,\\" \\"This House Is Empty Now,\\" you will get perfect art pieces by Burt that are perfect for Elvis' lyrics.<br /><br />The era for both artists to be hitmakers is long gone. The lovingly crafted Top 40 Bacharach made in the 60s has no place on today's Ban Roll-On radio. It is just too good, too covertly complex, and too genuine. Costello is too interested, emotionally engaged, in keeping on exploring the punk, rockabilly, new wave, Beatleisms, and yes, 60s AM pop permutations that has kept him from being a new wave rehash and allowed him to be one of music's most facinating artists.<br /><br />But outside commerce's teeth, the two have crated something very special on Painted From Memory; an art project that takes the work of two pop kings, and turns it into art as high as classical music.<br /><br />Our classical music.
B002N83H1G|1.0|I bought this book relying on the critics on the cover. Well, I think the critics didn't read this whole book. I didn't find anything funny in it. The voices of the book, Desmond and the narrator change one ot the other without any apparent reason or else because it feels like the author copied a whole lot of his entries of the diary in the book rather than obeing to any narrative logic. There is the Alex character, who is so predictable,  that at the end you are happy that she disappears of the plot, even if it is a weakness of dramatugy. The wife is a joke... the father, the most touching. Too many pages of disgregations about almost anything... I am very disappointed of the author, I will not read any other of his books.
B00008BXJF|4.0|On this 2003 album, King Crimson continue as a quartet-Bruford and Levin are gone. But where on [[ASIN:B00004SX3H The ConstruKction of Light]] the music seeemed a bit thin on rehashed, this is not a problem here.<br /><br />Structually, the two are not that different, but on Power, the guitars are cranked on fuzz and this gives the band a fuller sound. This is evident from go on the amazing \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With,\\" a track that could almost be a Tool number.<br /><br />Belews lyrics are great--not for their wordplay, but for their subject matter. \\"Happy with what you have to be happy with/you have to be happy with what you have/to be happy/you have to be happy with what you have to be happy with.\\" Abastract, but we all know what he means, becuase we are all in the same boat.<br /><br />The album has the rigorous workouts you would expect on any King Crimson album, particularly after [[ASIN:B000003S0I Larks' Tongues in Aspic]]. These work between more song-oritented pieces--and little vocal interludes courtisy of Belew, and the album flows nicely. It never feels forced and it always feels Crimson.<br /><br />That can NEVER be bad.
0316779237|2.0|I really enjoy David Sedaris.  However, this compilation of stories didn't sustain my interest.  Partly because I have read some of the stories in other collections, and partly because they just didn't flow together as naturally as his other collections of essays.  I liked the theme of the holidays being less than perfection. It wasn't as hillarious and wake your husband up because your laughing out loud as the others.
1416575464|5.0|I got this book and passed it along to my daughter.  My daughter has been pouring over this book!  She is sad that Domino Magazine is no longer being published.  I have also looked this book over and found a lot of great guidance on how to \\"...create...a home that makes you happy.\\"<br /><br />This book is a compendium of decorating ideas.  The chapter titles are:  Ch.1: Getting Started, Ch.2: The Entryway, Ch.3: The Living Room, Ch.4: The Dining Room, Ch.5: The Kitchen, Ch.6: The Bedroom,  Ch.7: The Bathroom, Ch.8: The Office, Ch.9: The Kids' Room, The Decorators' Handbook, The Big Black Book (a guide to the best decorating resources).<br /><br />Each of the area chapters shows some examples of different styles that fit the given space as well as some examples of the larger pieces of furniture that might go into the area.  For example, Chapter 4 on Dining rooms shows 3 different styles of dining rooms and then shows several dining tables.  There are then pages entitled \\"How to Mix and Match\\" showing how the different pieces could be grouped in the room.  Then, \\"Very Important Tips\\" (in this case, chairs, buffet tables, curtains and lighting), \\"Decorating Tricks\\" and \\"More Decorating Tricks,\\" \\"Small-Space Solutions,\\" \\"Finishing Touches,\\" and finally, \\"The Domino Effect\\" which shows how one person put together their own room, piece by piece.  Each of the chapters is full of pictures, so you see several examples of how rooms are pulled together and arranged.  There are also sections on \\"Small-Space Solutions\\" and \\"Tricks for Renters\\" as well as other sections that have application in one part or another of the house.<br /><br />In every chapter there are lots of pictures of many different rooms.  \\"The Domino Effect\\" shows how a person pulled together the different elements of a room into the finished product.  It is very interesting seeing how those elements were chosen and how they came together in the finished room.<br /><br />The Decorators' Handbook shows the various items that come together in an abode:  Curtains and Shades, Upholstery, Beds, Pillows and Trim.  Lots of line drawings in that section.  \\"The Big Black Book,\\" is a listing of resources found throughout.<br /><br />This book will give you lots of ideas of how to put together your own home.  There are plenty of pictures so one can easily visualize the outcome.  Great resource for finding just the right design.

Running is the conduit through which an amazing history, mystery, autobiography, lifestyle, philosophy is relayed.  It's a quietly brilliant book.
B000ZELISO|5.0|This is a very entertaining film. I was surprised that people expect this to follow the book to a T. Books and films are different genres, and a the cuts from the book helped to create a cohent 2.5 hour movie rendition of a very long book. If you want to see the blow-by-blow movie, this isn't it. If you have not been following the book or movie series, you will be confused beyond your wildest dreams. However, if you have reasonable expectations from a movie adaptation of a book, you will enjoy the film.
0812973992|5.0|Nothing is entirely by itself.<br /><br />As a theme, that has \\"trite potential\\" written all over it. In the hands of Colum McCann, the theme is treated masterfully and with care.<br /><br />The observation, that \\"nothing is entirely by itself,\\" comes from Gloria as she's leaving a gathering of women who have lost sons in Vietnam. \\"Each thing as strange as the last, and connected,\\" she concludes.<br /><br />Those connections are bound together by Philippe Petit's mind-boggling tightrope walk between the World Trade Centers in 1974. That's the common thread--or wire--that loops through these stories. The loop is loose at first, then grows tighter and cinches up neatly, after the book has shot its last story-arrow up and over the War in Iraq, at the end. Too neatly? This is probably a matter of how sweet you like your endings. I vote yes. It feels entirely real and it leaves you with a ray of hope that human connections do make a difference.<br /><br />McCann enters the worlds of each of his main characters with ease. We are inside Petit's head (though Petit is unnamed) and inside the head of a Jesuit priest, a prostitute, a judge, an artist, and a Park Ave. woman of means.  I enjoyed all the writing and the shift in voice and tone from character to character, but Claire Soderberg is particularly well drawn. Her grief is palpable. She's one of several mothers who have bonded over the loss of their sons in Vietnam and, when we meet her for the first time, is about to host the group at her relatively fancy apartment for the first time.<br /><br />\\"How to greet? Handshake? Air kiss? Smile? The first time around they had hugged good-bye, all of them, in Staten Island, at the doorstep, with the taxi beeping, her eyes streaked with tears, arms around one another, all of us happy, at Marcia's house, when Janet pointed to a yellow balloon caught in the treetops: Oh, let's meet again soon! And Gloria had squeezed her arm. They had touched cheeks.\\"<br /><br />MCann's characters pinball off each other and we begin to see how their lives overlap too, how the small decisions in one setting lead to the consequences in the next.  I found McCann's descriptions detailed, rich and inviting. The dialogue was just as sharp.<br /><br />\\"Let The Great World Spin\\" is symphony and engages a wide range of players, all relying on each other to produce one big sound. I couldn't agree more with the awards heading McCann's way. This is one memorable book and I would love to see somebody pull this off on film.how their lives overlap too, how the small decisions in one setting lead to the consequences in the next.

B00009ATIX|5.0|First, it is important to note that \\"Solaris\\" is not a movie for everyone.  As other reviews suggest, the movie can come across as boring and flat.  I found this to be a movie, however, with a lasting appeal that makes a significant impression on the viewer with an interest in deep and complex psychological issues.<br /><br />A memorable quote from the movie captures, I think, the challenge of reviewing \\"Solaris\\": \\"I could tell you what's happening, but I don't know if it would really tell you what's happening.\\"  Put another way, the issues and messages conveyed in this movie are complex and, some might say, buried.<br /><br />At its essence, \\"Solaris\\" addresses the central question of reality -- it examines what is real and what is imagined.  Through the use of dark and powerful cinematography, sound effects, and character portrayals, \\"Solaris\\" asks the viewer to consider the line between mind and matter.<br /><br />This movie takes patience and a desire to consider complex topics.  For the viewer with such a demeanor and such interests, this is a fantastic movie.  Numerous viewings of \\"Solaris\\" bring out many nuances of the mind versus matter question.  I highly recommend this excellent work.
B002MRROKI|5.0|You have to know that Kurdt Kobain was an enigmatic rock and roll star.  Reluctant to accept fame he craved it just the same.  I think this is why he was never content with himself or anything much else in life except maybe his art and his music.<br /><br />He once said that, \\"Punk Rock should mean freedom; liking and playing what you want; as sloppy as you want as long as it's good and has passion....I'll write a few sincere lines and then I'll have to make fun of it with another line....\\"  He didn't want to be \\"too obvious\\" or \\"then it gets stale\\", he said.  But he didn't want to be \\"too cryptic\\" nor should lyrics be \\"in peoples faces\\".  He liked them to be somewhat \\"weird and spacey\\" as that \\"painted a nice picture\\" concluding that \\"I guess that's the way I like Art\\".  (from \\"Live! Tonight! Sold-Out!\\")<br /><br />Another thing you should know about Kurt Cobain is that when his voice was off in a live rendition of a song, he would often mock it and deteriorate it to the point of silliness, For example in Come As You Are in Amsterdam in 1991, he screams the lyrics in a child tantrum-like voice after coming in off-key.  The difficulty he has with this song isn't as evident on Live At Reading, thank goodness, and the Solo is excellent.  Kurt Cobain was a complex individual, an inspiration to millions of kids and young adults and the last most recent frontman / guitar god to grace our planet.  His live best is better than anybody else and his live worst is probably about the same.<br /><br />In Live At Reading Kurt mostly shines in both his guitar playing and his vocals (Dave and Krist were spot on throughout, esp., Dave who's drumming must be inspired by Bonzo).  My favorite live song combo is \\"Drain You\\" followed by \\"Aneurysm\\" from the Wishkah collection.  The combo on this one is about equal to that one as Aneurysm is better here, but Drain You is slightly off (but still killer all the same!).<br /><br />The most disappointing guitar performance is during Smells Like Teen Spirit.  He is spotty in hitting and then letting \\"ring\\" Riffs \\"A\\" and \\"B\\": in the Intro when he can't hit Riff A he sounds like he's Milking It (tuning his guitar which works in Milk It); and when he hits Riff A he can't let it \\"ring\\"; in the second chorus he hits Riff B but can't let it \\"ring\\".  To top it off he completely botches the Solo.  (And I don't believe it was done purposely even given his hatred of Smells, either).  If he was just playing \\"sloppy\\" I hope he thought it was good and felt \\"passion\\" while doing it, but I know it didn't hit me this way.  Although Smells comes right in the middle of the set, it seems that Kurt's singing and playing get better with every song during this show.  Maybe he just needed to get warmed up vocally.<br /><br />It is a pleasure to hear live electric versions of \\"About A Girl\\", \\"On A Plain\\", \\"All Apologies\\", \\"Dumb\\", \\"The Money Will Roll Right In\\" and \\"D-7\\".  Overall this audio CD gives new and old fans a real taste of Kurt's sonic brilliance.<br /><br />All-in-All, have a very Merry Nirvana set by adding this to your collection!tty in hitting and then letting \\"ring\\" Riffs \\"A\\" and \\"B\\": in the Intro when he can't hit Riff A he sounds like he's Milking It (tuning his guitar which works in Milk It); and when he hits Riff A he can't let it \\"ring\\"; in the second chorus he hits Riff B but can't let it \\"ring\\".

0393061310|2.0|Although Diamond's thesis is the central role that geography plays in the development of societies, he has another intention: to undermine any racist ideas that try to explain the varied development of these societies. Unfortunately, he often strains to push forward this laudable claim at the expense of balanced reason.<br /><br />Guns, Germs, and Steel consistently suffers from poor or inconsistent argumentation. In the prologue he states that he has the \\"impression that New Guineans are smarter than Westerners\\" (p. 20) because, \\"modern European and American children spend so much of their time being passively entertained by television, radio and movies\\" (p. 21). Yet he consistently repeats that at least 13,000 years of history is needed to assess peoples and cultures; to do otherwise would lead to racist conclusions.  How can he then make inference about a people's intelligence based on 100 years of history? In Chapter 15, he recounts how two British men died on an expedition from North to South Australia, unable to cope with the hot Australian climate and difficult terrain: \\"Robert Burke and William Wills were smart enough to write, but not smart enough to survive in Australian desert regions\\" (p. 321).  He makes a similar case about him and his wife's difficult trek in Australia. But, repeatedly he states that one of the conditions of long-term success for any people is population size.  No doubt, a large population facilitates specialization and adaptation.  So how can he draw race-based inferences about intelligence based on a sample size of four? In other arguments, he begs the question: for example, he points to today's undomesticated animals and uses that assessment as evidence that they were not domesticable 13,000 years ago (and are not domesticated today) (p. 162-175).<br /><br />On other occasions he invokes various political philosophies - and does a disservice to them.  Diamond provides an incorrect summation of the ideas of Aristotle and Rousseau inorder to compare their ideas about the foundations of societies with his own. Aristotle does not argue that \\"states [are] the natural condition of human society\\" (p. 282). Rather, Aristotle is not even interested to discuss communities other than the city-state (polis) because he wants to discuss a partnership of free and inter-relating human beings. Moreover he considers man a political animal because he is driven to live in a community - whether it is a state, chiefdom, tribe or band is irrelevant.  Only in a human society can man fulfill his true nature - this is Aristotle's line of reasoning.  Rousseau did not \\"speculate that states are formed by a social contract, a rational decision reached when people calculated their self-interest\\" (p. 283). Instead, Rousseau argued that society should be organized as a contract between free individuals. A social contract is not a description of how society is or has been, but how it should be. Equality is the natural human state; while society had been used to impose artificial restraints.  Rousseau's social contract is prescriptive, not descriptive.  He also offers a superficial Marxist interpretation of the role of religion.  It is meant to placate the masses in accordance with the wishes of the ruling class (pp. 277-278).  I don't know why Diamond does not consider the multitude of other anthropological explanations for the development of religion: it offers consolation; it provides meaning and makes sense of man's role in the universe; it gives conceptual coherence to many disparate and confusing phenomena, etc. Wouldn't an anthropological approach be more commensurate with his methodology?<br /><br />I don't deny Diamond's thesis that geography has played and continues to play a vital role in the development of mankind. Indeed, I agree with it, although there are other factors at play, such as culture, values, commerce and warfare which can and have trumped geography. It is a perspective that historians and philosophers have long considered.  At least as far back as the 17th century, Montesquieu argued, in The Spirit of the Laws, that climate and geography shape the character of peoples.<br /><br />Ultimately this book is a hodge-podge of unconvincing arguments, inappropriate summaries, and recent anthropological scholarship. It is the last feature which is the book's only worthwhile feature: it provides a consolidation of various interesting research on agriculture, language, and tools.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|Loved the movie, had to have the CD.  It's a sad world without MJ, but the legend will live forever.  Listen to the CD whenever I'm feeling low or need a lift, his music always puts you in a better mood.  Superb, as always.
B002C6K7NU|5.0|The band really came out with a good one after all these years. Fresh new power gives the listener hope for old rockers like Skynyrd. I like the fact that Rickey Medlock is given songwriting credit on all the songs. He was with the band for a spell during the early days then left to form Blackfoot. He was denied status as a member with the Rock n roll hall of fame when they were honored as members. That was a cheap shot because he has been a major player with Skynyrd for many years. I saw Rickey at the Native American Music Awards and I saw Skynyrd at Buffalo Bills Casino in Primm Valley several years ago. The boys are in their prime!    The new album mixes a harder rock edge with a country groove. Excellent recording! With the dip in Cd sales due to the whole internet transition it is difficult for new music to pay the bills. I wish them success!    Michael Folkert,  Condor Records Inc.

B0026P3G12|4.0|Everyone thinking of buying this CD will have heard Susan Boyle do four songs on YouTube, including \\"I Dreamed a Dream,\\" \\"Memory,\\" \\"Wild Horses\\" and \\"Cry Me a River.\\"  Fortunately, her fairly tentative BGT version of \\"Memory\\" is absent from the lineup here.  My favorite track, though, was an anthem of independence, \\"You'll See.\\"  I'm not a fan of pop music or show tunes in any sense of the word, and had never heard any other singer's version of many of these pieces.  As far as I can tell, the only song not recorded by anyone before is \\"What I Was Born to Be.\\"  I couldn't understand a word of the lyrics, so can't say much about it.<br /><br />Susan Boyle has a beautiful, pure, flexible, and emotionally-moving voice.  In a few tracks she tries to funk it up a bit, coming pretty close to a Scotch version of urban Black or fake Country-Western delivery, but it's generally recognizably SuBo.  I also particularly liked her take on \\"Cry Me a River,\\" with this version being quite different from the decade-old audition CD posted on YouTube.<br /><br />Since this is the best-selling CD or album release by any female artist since detailed statistics began to be kept, you don't need to hear much from me or anyone else about it.  You probably want it and already have it or have ordered it.  If not you can find it near the cash register at nearly any drug store in the civilized world.

0618001905|5.0|How convenient it is for Europeans and their descendants to think ourselves as bringing the light of civilization to the benighted hordes of native people throughout the world. How inconvenient to have a book like this shine a light on the dark, greedy side of the European soul.<br /><br />\\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" brings forward the utter horror that was the Belgian Congo in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. King Leopold II, ambitious to rule a colony of his own, found the last spot on earth that was still available -- the ivory and rubber rich lands around the Congo River in central Africa. By stealth, deceit and unspeakable violence, he wrested control of the area from the local tribesmen. Posing to fellow Europeans as a financially-disinterested humanitarian, Leopold forced millions of Congolese to bring in the riches of their land. The violence was appalling. Severed hands, hostages, the fearsome \\"chicotte\\" (a sharp-edged whip), burned villages and the halving of the Congo's population were the result. A few missionaries and other men of conscience (including the incomparable Mark Twain) worked hard to stir up outrage in Europe and the US. The book details the stories of Henry Morton Stanley, the murderous explorer; George Washington Williams, a black American lawyer who wrote about his first-hand experiences in the Congo; Joseph Conrad, whose \\"Heart of Darkness\\" barely fictionalized the atrocities he witnessed; E. D. Morel, who uncovered the lie behind \\"trade\\" with the Congolese; Roger Casement, whose passion for Congolese freedom merged with his Irish patriotism; and William Shepherd, black American missionary who loved Africans as people, not as subjects. If there was any shortcoming to the book it was the lack of indigenous African voices. But I assume this was a matter of a dearth of research.<br /><br />Author Adam Hochschild does a brilliant job of capturing the period in this marvelous book. He also take on some of the more complex and less-comforting aspects of the story. While the US and England were expressing their outrage over the cruelty of the Belgians, they were presiding over their own brutal colonial periods.\\" In the final chapter Hochschild follows the Congolese past the colonial period, into the post=WWII period, into independence in 1960, the CIA-backed murder of Patrice Lumumba and the decades long kleptocracy of Mobutu Sese Seko.<br /><br />\\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a must-read for those interested in the roots of Africa's slow rise from its painful colonial past.story.

3795753384|4.0|I like everything about this work except the quality of the binding, which is sub-par. I haven't lost any pages yet, but only because I've treated it with great care. I expect the pages to start fluttering away within ten years. At that point, I'll just pay to have it rebound with a spiral binding that will lay flat nicely on the piano. So I recommend this edition, but be aware that eventually you might need to rebind it.

B001TODCII|5.0|Liam Neeson becomes a one man avenging angel when his daughter is taken by sex slave traders in Paris during the 21st century .    For 20 minutes we establish Neeson as a spook + who loves his daughter but was never there, his wife is has remarried a very rich man and he can't compete with him.  The daughter wants to take a trip overseas with a friend, her father objects but relents with conditions that she ignores.    Lucky for her she keeps the phone he gave him and at about the 27 minute mark when she is taken he gives his ultimatum to the man on the other line, his daughter or his life.  As the movie progresses it is clearly established that like the villain in [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition)]] he chooses poorly.    At this point he is no longer the weaker link in a family squabble, he becomes John Wayne in [[ASIN:B00008CMR4 Big Jake]] without Maureen O'Hara or sons to back him up.  The locale is different and his foes are not looking for his cash but the quest is the same, the girl alive OR them dead, each and every one of them, but he makes a slight alteration; the  OR becomes an AND.    Like [[ASIN:B000YIGND6 Trade]] we see the inhumanity of the modern slave trade and the indifference of those who practice it.  Unlike trade we get a movie that is meant to entertain and does.      It may be less realistic but the results are immensely more satisfying.  He proceeds with no mercy to anyone who would hinder him, it is that lack of mercy or honor that makes this movie even better.    If you are a Wayne or Eastwood fan you will enjoy this movie particularly the last half of it.  If you are a Michael Moore fan you will not.    Simple as that.
B000050FEN|5.0|the guy that wrote this movie is not right.  that being said, this is a gooood movie. the idea of the 'seven' deaths is off the hook.  another one to shut off the lights, turn up the sound and watch.  have popcorn too. with parmasian cheese. its good.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is first and foremost, an action movie. Many of the scenes are simply incredible, and they only look better in Blu-ray. However, if you haven't played the original game--[[ASIN:B00000JRSB Final Fantasy VII]] for PSX, or [[ASIN:B0014X7SQ6 Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII]] for PSP--you will not understand any level of the story. I must say, the first time I watched this--before I got the game on PSN--I had no idea what was going on, I just knew it looked terrific. For you die hard FF7 fans, you SHOULD get this. It is the sequel to the original FF7 and is worth watching at least once to conjure up all of those good memories of playing FF7.     For all of you who haven't played the game, as I said earlier, you won't get what's happening. And, if you are one of these people, you probably should not buy it until after playing FF7, or Crisis Core.     In the end, I absolutely loved it, mostly because of the connections I had with the characters--specifically Cloud and Vincent. There are also some special features, but not nearly as many as they make it sound. If I remember correctly, there were around 5 special features, including the Final Fantasy XIII preview that gives some more insight into the upcoming game. So buy it if you love the characters and incredible action fliks, but get FF7 and crisis core first.

0596009208|5.0|I'm a fairly well versed programmer in some of the older style languages like C and C++. If you have some archaic C question, I may be your woman. I'm not so familiar with Java - in fact the last time I touched the language I could run to the local coffee shop, get a coffee, and get back to my program and it would just be starting up (back in the dark days, when java was really slow). Fast forward 12 years and not only is Java nimble and performant, but its something I need to know. Yesterday. Knowing this, I turned to the Head first series as they get their points across quickly and cleanly.<br /><br />Head First really does teach the topics so that you'll remember them. Most into programming books give you an example and you work through it. In Head First, yes there is an example, but the examinations happen via stories, diagrams, pictures, games and really good (bad) humor. What this means is that no matter how you learn, you'll find something that helps the concepts stick. Each chapter builds upon the last and each chapter reinforces lessons from before. You can tell that people who really know how to teach designed these books.<br /><br />Now this book is basic. I personally didn't mind reading about Objects and Object-Oriented design yet again. I also didn't mind reading about polymorphism, encapsulation, et al. The main reason for this is the presentation. Well that and there are a few subtle differences between C++ and Java that they talk about that I need to know. But mostly its the fun way they present the topics. I mean even if you know these topics cold, I still found some of their examples and comparisons well thought out and memorable. So much so in fact that I can see using them to help explain concepts to people I'll mentor or to marketing folks.<br /><br />If, however, you have programmed in Java before and are comfortable in the world of OO, and are looking for something to take you to the next step, I'd suggest you keep moving onto other books (Effective Java by Bloch is amazing). However, if you are new to Java, and even new to programming, you'll love the Head First books. The writing is clear and engaging (and correct!), the examples make sense, and way they tailor lessons to trigger different parts of your learning brain is really well done.is amazing).

0312570740|4.0|This is good book and I would daresay, an important one.  For a man of his importance and prominence, Marc Rich has not been the focus of too many books.  The total access that the author got to write this book makes it a very worthy read.  For decades the only side of this story I knew was the prosecution's case.  Ammann's interviews with Rich allow us to hear the other side, to hear counter arguments and perspective from the man himself.  Does he give a totally balanced and detailed explanation of Rich's activities?  No.  Does it matter?  Not really, since someone else will probably have to write that book.  This subject area is ripe for further research and I welcome Ammann's effort here.

Rose's Christmas Cookies offers a variety of recipes, not only for Christmas, but anytime, ranging from the fancy show-off cookies to the every day put-in-your-lunchbox variety.  The recipes found in this cookbook will soon become part of  your family's tradition and holiday memories.  All of the recipes are good, all are accurate & easy to follow.  There is no negative at all to be found with this book and the sole improvement possible would be to make it all easy to wash off the inevitable spatters that occur with a favorite cook book.  I've had a copy since it first came out in 1990, and the first copy wore out and had to be replaced (spine took a beating with salivating children deciding what was on the list of to-bake.)  If I had to cut my cookbook collection down to a few books, this one would make the cut, its honestly that good.  My daughter still practically drools when she sees the book come out, and she's \\"ever so much more than twenty\\" to take a line from Peter Pan.    If you are looking for the perfect cookie cookbook for yourself or a gift, this is it.  The 1961 Betty Crocker Cookie  Cook Book is another.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I just returned my 405 - I tried very hard to like this, but in the end, it was just way too expensive for all the issues I had using it.  I'm surprised by the four star rating it currently has on Amazon.    I have used a Forerunner 305 for over two years now (which I absolutely love) and thought that the 405 would be a nice upgrade.  Smaller, better GPS, newer technology, etc.  But the problem is that Garmin added the now infamous \\"touch bezel\\".  It is not necesarily that the bezel is too sensitive, just that it reacts everytime it touches something.  For instance, when you touch your leg mid-run to tie a shoe, scratch an itch, pull up a sock, etc.  When the weather turned cold, I discovered that the special running material on my running jacket sets the bezel off.  My running buddies that have the 405 actually wear the watch OVER their jacket!  75% of the time I look down at the watch it is on some random screen.  You can lock the bezel so the screen won't change, but to do this you have to press the start/stop and lap/reset buttons at the same time - so then you end up stopping the watch half the time.  What a mess.    THe people I know that do use a 405 don't have anything nice to say about it.  They use it because they've already paid for it and it does the most important thing, which is track distance.    I have no idea why Garmin decided to go with the bezel design, but it seriously seems like no one there ever really put it through its paces.  I did really like the improved GPS reception and the brighter backlight, but that was about all.  Hopefully the next model will just use regular old buttons or I may have to move on to a different brand.    A summary of my pros/cons over the previous model if you are still considering buying this:    Pros:  -Improved GPS and form factor  -Backlight is really bright  -Software seems improved    Cons:  -Touch bezel causes random screens to appear - too sensitive, can't wear with cold weather gear  -Bezel locking button combo causes you to inadvertently stop the watch or move to a new lap  -Data screens only hold max of 3 fields instead of 4  -You can only scroll through your workout screens in one direction - eg, you need to cycle through all screens to get the one prior to the one you are looking at.    Bottom line:  Either buy a 205/305 or wait for the model after the 405 and pray it doesn't have a touch bezel.
B000ZELISO|1.0|Its got content worthy of a 42 minute tv episode. It lacks a beginning and an ending. Killing an important character deserves better treatment.

Spending $15 was an absolute waste of money and waste of electricity.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|INVICTUS is an interesting and often gripping film that nonetheless fails to deliver the emotional or intellectual blow it is clearly meant to.  This is due primarily to what is usually a strength of Clint Eastwood's work as director...and to the somewhat sanitized feel of the story.    The film tells the true story of a small portion of Nelson Mandela's life, when he took a strong interest in the national rugby team of South Africa (the Springboks), because he believed their success would help him unite a divided country AND show the world the potential of the new South Africa.    When we meet the Springboks and their captain (played by Matt Damon, in another understated, naturalistic performance that is quick making him a significant acting force)...they are a team of all but one white player.  They are avidly followed by the white population of South Africa...while at the same time they are playing well below their potential and essentially being lambasted by the media.  In the South Africa of that time (early `90s), the black citizens embraced soccer, and Rugby was the sport that served as a reminder of Apartheid, with the colors and name that symbolized that horrible time.    President Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) senses that he might be able to convince a skeptical white population of his seriousness in being a leader for ALL by taking an interest in rugby.  It's a cynical move that is also sincere at the same time.  Mandela risks the anger of the blacks that elevated him to legendary status by convincing the National Sports commission to allow the Springboks to continue with their name and colors.      All this occurs as the World cup of Rugby is just months away from coming to South Africa.  Mandela knows his efforts will amount to little if the team fails in the early going...so through meetings with Damon, he manages to pass a bit of inspiration down to the team.      In a wonderful and telling scene, we see the Rugby team headed out to teach a rugby camp to kids in a poor, black neighborhood.  At first, the kids are only interested in Chester, the only black man on the team.  They swarm to him...oblivious to the rest of team and to the sport.  Yet we see slowly how these EXTREMELY reluctant coaches embrace their parts a role models and begin to work with the kids.  By the end of the day, all concerned are happily exhausted...and totally thrilled.  The scene is a cliché in many ways, but it is tidy and effective.  We begin to see how little victories will eventually yield the big victory Mandela (and the team) are hoping for.      As a director, Eastwood always allows for a leisurely pace.  He lets actors breathe.  He lets them pause.  He keeps his camera on them for a second longer than any other director would.  This allows us, sometimes, to feel we know a character better.  We feel we've been invited to share in even the most mundane moments of their lives (this is why GRAN TORINO worked so well...we cared so much about the characters that we overlooked the deeply clichéd story arc).  But what the story of INVICTUS needs is more of a hurtling, headlong pace.  It ambles, even when the \\"pressure cooker\\" of the tournament and all it means for the country comes to a head.  There is little sense of urgency...and the film really could have used it.  I was always interested...but never to the point of giving myself over to emotion.    That's also due in part to the fact that we've got two parallel stories (Mandela's and the team's).  They frequently intersect...but they rarely bounce off each other in unexpected ways.  Yes, it's a true story, but it takes such a leisurely, mostly expected course that it feels like a clichéd sports movie.  But we haven't thoroughly invested in the Springboks because we've spent so much time with Mandela, that the sports accomplishments seem secondary.  And our knowledge of Mandela is reduced almost exclusively to something akin to \\"#1 Rugby fan.\\"  Clearly, he was a much, much more interesting and complex man...yet we are only shown very limited glimpses of him.  We see his keen yet instinctive grasp of the politics of race in his country.  We believe his desire to forgive the sins of the past so his country can move forward (his actions along these lines are the most inspiring moments of the film...and most come fairly early).  We get just the tiniest sense of his troubled domestic wife, although his wife Winnie is never mentioned by name.  I won't say he's portrayed as a one-dimensional saint...but it's close to it.    The reason Mandela ISN'T just a one-dimensional saint is because of Morgan Freeman.  Eastwood's love of allowing his actors to act truly frees up the best in Freeman.  With MILLION DOLLAR BABY, Freeman won his first Oscar.  There's a chance he could win #2 with his latest work under Eastwood.  (I should also mention that one of Freeman's most overlooked performances was his stunning role in Eastwood's UNFORGIVEN.)  No actor is better than Freeman at taking one-dimensional, saintly characters (everything from DEEP IMPACT to even SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) and giving them an inner life that is frequently only expressed by the subtlest changes of expression.  We're accustomed to Freeman's dulcet tones (what a great speaking voice he has)...but the reason he's in another category is because of the little things we barely notice.  And he is not only the perfect choice to play Mandela, he's probably the ONLY choice (in the way Forest  Whitaker was perfect for Idi Amin...not only was the acting outstanding, but the physical resemblance alone is a plus).    In the end, I felt more educated that enlightened.  My mind had new things in it...but not my heart so much.  (There are a few moments, such as the sobering visit to Mandela's jail cell, that help to enlighten us as to how large an accomplishment Mandela's forgiveness was.)  If I had understood Rugby better, perhaps the games themselves would have been more exciting...but I suspect mostof the action in them is fairly generic.  If I had seen more of Mandela's other work, perhaps I would have felt a greater sense of HIS accomplishment.    In the end, there is much to admire in INVICTUS, and I certainly would encourage everyone to see it.  It is also the kind of film that will cause lots of folks to learn more about Mandela & South Africa.  (I can even see high school classes using it as a springboard for much more learning.)  But in the end, I couldn't help feeling just a little disappointed.
B0009WQ3P0|3.0|For those looking for a thorough overview of Fleetwood Mac's recorded output from their first 25 years, this is not for you. This set is perfect for those Fleetwood Mac fans who are only familiar with the Buckingham-Nicks incarnation of the band & look to add ONLY the best known songs from the other incarnations. The Buckingham-Nicks years are covered on over 3/4 of this set with the years 1967-1974 crammed onto the fourth CD. As a fan of all incarnations of Fleetwood Mac, especially the Peter Green-led incarnations, I like the Buckingham-Nicks material here, but there is TOO MUCH! There is nothing here from the great \\"Future Games\\" album from 1971 with the exception of an alternate version of Bob Welch's \\"Lay It All Down\\" which was the weakest song on the original album. There is one song only from each of the following albums: \\"Bare Trees\\", \\"Penguin\\", \\"Fleetwood Mac In Chicago\\", & \\"Kiln House\\". There is nothing here from their debut album \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" aka \\"The Dog & Dustbin\\" album. Their biggest hit until \\"Rhiannon\\" in '75, \\"Oh Well\\" parts 1&2 is represented by part 1 only & in mono to boot! Here's a partial list of songs left out of this collection in favor of some less deserving Buckingham-Nicks material: Jeremy Spencer's killer version of \\"Shake Your Moneymaker\\", the excellent, but forgotten Danny Kirwan penned single \\"Dragonfly\\", \\"Before The Beginning\\", one of the best songs Peter Green wrote while a member of the band, \\"Purple Dancer\\", the b-side of \\"Dragonfly\\" also penned by Danny Kirwan, \\"World In Harmony\\", the b-side to \\"The Green Manalishi\\", & one of the best instrumentals in the band's catalog, \\"Woman Of 1,000 Years\\" & \\"Sands Of Time\\", both from \\"Future Games\\" & two of Danny Kirwan's best, \\"Show Me A Smile\\" from \\"Future Games\\" & \\"Spare Me A Little\\" from \\"Bare Trees\\", both written by Chris McVie & the two best songs she wrote for the band hands down, \\"Future Games\\", the title song from the same album & THE best song Bob Welch wrote for the band, \\"SunnySide Of Heaven\\" from \\"Bare Trees\\", a Danny Kirwan instrumental which is not only beautiful, but also one of the best he wrote, \\"Drifting\\", one of the first songs the original band recorded featuring some burning blues bends by the great Peter Green, \\"Safe Harbor\\", a beautiful Bob Welch tune with music reminiscent of \\"Albatross\\". \\"Good Things (Come To Those Who Wait)\\", left off the \\"Mystery To Me\\" album in favor of a cover of The Yardbirds' \\"For Your Love\\", I could go on forever, but I think you get the picture. Ken Caillat, who put this collection together is obviously ignorant of the band's recorded output before Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks joined the band in 1975 & he does their recorded legacy a great disservice with this collection. There is just too much missing here & the ONLY reason I bought this was to add the unreleased & at the time, new recordings to my collection. Hopefully the band will release a more complete set in the future & will have more of a say in what's included next time. Not bad, but disappointing.
B001MW0J2O|2.0|This album is deceptive. Sucks you in with \\"My Girls\\" and \\"Brothersport\\" then sort of leaves you cold after a few months. It has zero staying power or replay value. One of the reasons I think this is the case is there is too much chordal repetition---the songs reveal themselves too quickly and suddenly you find yourself with nothing new to uncover or discover. The production on this album is also way overcompressed and harsh depending on the speakers you listen to it on. Over hyped, but more importantly it's a shallow collection of fun songs, with no soul or depth. Surely a lot of fun for a week or two, but ultimately something that will fade from memory and leave little to no impression.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie is gorgeous. The animation and art is beautiful and I thought the story was somewhat unique and fully entertaining. The thing with Pixar (I think) is that they always try to give you good characters; the kind of characters you bond with and go on the journey with and I really thought this movie had amazing characters. There was humor and excitement as well as some very tender moments that I believe will keep older kids, younger kids, and kids at heart fully satisfied.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What can I say except that this film is exceptional not only in its fine graphics, but in it's original story line.  At first, I must admit, it choked me up a bit.  Yes, I was moved by a cartoon!  I admit defeat and am not ashamed to.<br /><br />The way time progression was handled was brilliant.  To be able to view Carl and his deceased wife as children made us feel even more connected to these characters than we would have if they had left that whole time sequence out of the film.  She was spunky, he was quiet.  They made a sweet couple.  She had dreams that they never fulfilled, or so Carl thought.  What he found out in the end was an invaluable lesson...the joys of an ordinary life were treasured by his wife as an adventure in itself and made me realize that although most of our life is made up of the ordinary things like washing dishes, painting the porch and sorting socks...well, it's all an adventure nonetheless.  Take a chance on this film.  It was well worth the time spent watching it.
0385532458|5.0|I have read everything Mr. Grisham has written, except Playing for Pizza and, like others, think he is a wonderful story teller.  (My favorite is A Time to Kill and my second favorite is The Painted House.)  And now, with Ford County, he gives us 7 delightful short stories, each one different, and each one a gem.  Unlike many of his novels which are sometimes highly implausible, these seven tales are as down-to-earth believable as they are heavenly to read. I was hesitant to buy this book, not knowing how well he would fare in the genre, but I'm so glad I did.  The stories are funny and sad, the characters are good and bad, and the outcomes are not always neat and tidy.  In other words, he offers the reader a perfect picture of every day people and every day life as we know it.  What more could we ask?
B001QOGY9K|5.0|What strikes me most about this film was not the fact that it was a \\"first\\" in that this Princess was African American.  What strikes me most is that this Princess is a first for other reasons...she was an independent girl who had a great sense of self, she knew what she wanted, she wasn't afraid of hard work and she wasn't sitting around dreaming and waiting for her Prince to come and save her.  She was practical, hardworking and I LOVED HER!  She is just what our young girls today need to see.  Not some beautiful blonde hanging her hair out of a castle window, or crying for a man she only glimpsed from afar.  We need a girl who rolls up her sleeves and knows what she wants out of life and isn't afraid of the hard work it takes to get there.  I applaud Disney for making a film about a real woman, not some love sick teeny-bopper who wants to marry a man just because he's handsome and he's a Prince.  Bravo!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I have been fascinated with Susan Boyle's story since I watched her youtube video.  Her music is the best I have listened to in a very long time.   I am really moved by her songs - she has really put heart and soul into this CD.  I love it.
B000P0J0A6|4.0|Ok, so it IS an entertaining film and has lots of laughs despite how corny it is at times. What I can't figure out, though, is who this movie is supposed to be for. It's definitely not for little kids - there is far too much violence and blood (even though the blood is green). Bad Gremlins doing adult things and exploding in microwaves mean this is not a 90 minute babysitter for the little ones. Gremlins was one of the films that pushed the ratings board to create the PG-13 rating. On the other hand, teenagers & above will probably find it a bit too cutesy and childish to appeal to them. Whatever - at eight dollars, you're sure to find some use for it!
B002IYEQR4|3.0|The only thing I didn't really like about the Ultimate Edition was the Black Freighter animation sequences which I feel brings down what is otherwise an excellent movie. My advice would be to just skip the Black Freighter parts as it doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rest of the story.
0743496736|4.0|This was the 3rd Jodi Picoult book I have read and I liked it a lot. She always has an amazing twist at the end of her books that you could never guess! If you like her books you will for sure like this one!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I would recommend everyone watch this documentary.  It is very eye opening and I feel I'm more aware of how I buy my groceries and how I eat!!!!  I want my whole family to watch this!!!
0061703257|5.0|I'm so glad I decided to read this book before the movie is released in 2010.  I wouldn't have known about this book unless I had seen the trailer for the movie, which I found very fascinating.  I soon realized that the same author, Dennis Lehane, had written Mystic River, which was another book of his that I thoroughly enjoyed.  This book is one of those books that definitely messes with your head.  It was a real page-turner, and I highly recommend it.  Hopefully, the movie will do this book justice.
055380684X|4.0|Mr. Coyle's The Talent Code is an interesting and fast-paced tour through centers of excellence around the world. He provides inspirational examples of \\"ordinary people\\" becoming exrtraordinary. His references to \\"deep practice\\" remind me of Michael Polanyi's ideas surrounding indwelling and commitment to knowledge. All-in-all I enjoyed this book, but have to agree with the reviewer who noted Mr. Coyle's correlation between the brain material myelin and his examples are anecdotal (in Mr. Coyle's defense, I'm not sure how he could have presented differently and still made the book interesting).   To his credit, Mr. Coyle has made a very complicated topic accessible to laymen and provides a sort of scientific scaffolding to the old saw-question; \\"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?----Practice, practice, practice.\\"   This book is highly recommended for educators, parents, coaches, and people who want to increase their skill-level. Very well done.
B001FB55I0|3.0|While lacking the blend of action and humanity that made the first two movies so good, this is a decent film as long as you don't go in with ginormous expectations.<br /><br />The plot is a little jumbled, the movie takes some time to hit its stride and the acting (especially by the leads) is plastic at times, but there are some good action sequences and enough going on that I was able to power through some wicked tiredness to watch this at 1 a.m. the other day.<br /><br />I particularly liked Marcus Wright's plotline, which is unfortunately undermined by some subpar acting on Worthington's part. I kind of enjoyed the fact that John Connnor isn't head of the human resistance; after the last two films one expects him to be the honcho. It was cool how John used his computer know-how in a few situation, harking back to T2 when he hacks into the ATM. The Kyle Reece storyline and the actor who plays him are really cool. That could almost have been its own movie.<br /><br />There was a lot I didn't like, or at least a lot of things I wish the filmmakers had re-considered:<br /><br />-- The numerous obvious nods to other moves are rife: Marcus emerges screaming and muddy from a subterranean labyrinth (Shawshank Redemption). John Connor's radio broadcast's to the at-large resistance fighters (Apocalypse Now). The final scene when John is rigging the nuclear power cells is both a cop of the end of Aliens and the first Terminator movie. A machine collects humans and holds them for transport (a theme from War of the Worlds that also looks very much like Spielberg's from a few years ago).<br /><br />-- Marcus emerges into a world he doesn't know, and yet he seems completely at ease. No freak-out over the destruction of humanity? No concern over robots hunting humans with giant machine guns?<br /><br />-- There are A-10 Warthog planes pulling maneuvers no A-10 Warthog could ever accomplish.<br /><br />-- The machines and the humans are in an all-out war. The machines are actively hunting the humans and yet on several occasions the resistance is seen staging raids out of giant army bases and airplane hangers full of equipment. Wouldn't that be a bit of a tell for the machines?<br /><br />-- It seems awfully easy for John to infiltrate the Skynet headquarters and do as he pleases. What, no perimeter guards as there would be at any central command base?<br /><br />There are a few other qualms I can't think of right now, including more nods to more movies and things the characters do that I personally would not be doing if I was being hunted by bloodthirsty robots. But overall, it's a pretty enjoyable movie that I would probably watch again.sistance is seen staging raids out of giant army bases and airplane hangers full of equipment.

B000RZIGVS|1.0|The STNG series we purchased took 3 weeks to arrive, and came from China, after ordering it from Bratley13 (Brad Gross). It was manufactured in the People's Republic of China with Mandarin shipping labels. The first disk was OK, but the next 5 CDs had defects severe enough that several episodes had glitches, and at least 1 episode on each disk was totally unreadable. We returned the merchandise, but the seller has yet to make good on his offer of replacement. We are still waiting as of 3 1/2 months.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I've only had this watch for a week, but I'm so super impressed with it that I decided to write a review after just one run (10m/16k) and a few hours of 'playing around'.  I must start by saying that this product, in contrast to what some reviewers had to say here, is super user-friendly.  I have probably used, or at least gone over all of the functions it has to offer, and I did not even open the instruction manual once.  If you know your way with gadgets, there is no reason why this shouldn't be a piece of cake for you.    I'm a marathon runner, and have used Polar RS200SD (with a foot pod) until I decided to step up to this little wonder.  I didn't want to settle for a watch that can show 32.12 or 33.96 for the same 33km run on different occasions - I wanted one I could rely on for turning around on my long runs.  Foot-pods just do not do that.  The 405CX's GPS features are amazing - satellites are found in a matter of seconds, and throughout my run, I had 4m (12ft) accuracy.  Even in my home I get 6-8m (18-24ft) accuracy.  I ran 16km and turned around at the place I know is exactly 8km from the starting point.  The Garmin showed 8.01, and by the time I was back it was 16.01.    The display is clear enough, and allows you to set up to 3 screens with 3 data-items each (choose from over 30, i.e. Speed, Avg-Speed, LastLap-Speed etc.), in addition to the HR screen (which is also configurable).  The VP is very helpful if you're trying to keep a steady pace, and allows you to always be aware of how you're doing in comparison to the pace you desired.  This is something I wish I had in my previous competitions.    Connection to the computer couldn't be easier, and I'm so happy to say goodbye to those stupid Polar 'SonicLink' sounds that belong to modems somewhere back in the early 90's.  One of the best things about data transfer is that Garmin (unlike Polar) do not keep their data secret, meaning I can use any software I want in order to analyze my runs, and not have tosettle on some stripped-down online tool, which does not even allow me to export its data in a format other than XML (Polar, again).    I could not be more satisfied with this watch.  It isn't cheap, but if you're a runner who wants to know exactly where you are on your run, and be confident that the speed the watch is showing is correct - this is the way to go.    Way to go Garmin - You've earned an enthusiastic new fan!
0375413405|3.0|This was in a movie recently, right? I have no one to attend movies with, but that sounds right. A Meryl Streep movie.    I don't cook much. I'm a vegetarian, in fact. Usually. Although I like duck. And I LOVE butter. Julia (and those other women) luxuriates in butter, long, purposeful, arduous afternoons of preparing meat in butter and cheese. I cooked one thing (crepes; I have no stomach for stuffing live lobster into boiling water, don't they fight back?). Lovely, if flat. A little greasy, with the butter. For the dedicated, but not the lonely. Her food is meant for groups, for couples. I had no one to cook for.
1400031524|5.0|This is the second book in the Kurt Wallander series, and I found it much more compelling than the first, although I thoroughly enjoyed that one also. Once again there is a mystery to be solved, in this case the appearance of two corpses washed up on the Swedish shore in a life raft. The initial question is, of course, who are these men and where did they come from? Once that is established, and it's not easy, Kurt is dispatched to Latvia to help in solving the murder of the Latvian policeman sent to Sweden to assist.<br /><br />This is a Latvia in the midst of its struggle to free itself from the grip of the Soviet Union, and it is a drab and cheerless place, where the citizens are frightened and distrustful of almost everyone around them. Wallander meets a group of folks organizing against the government, and when he returns home he goes back into Latvia by means of smuggling routes to help those people. There is a scene of great carnage, and Wallander must decide which of two high ranking police officers is the person responsible. The ending is exciting in the extreme, and you just keep turning the pages to find out what happens.<br /><br />I've enjoyed the first two books in the series, and am now reading the third. I hope to get through all of the ones published in English as they become available to me.
0439023483|5.0|This book is so amazing I couldn't put it down. I had to show it to all my friends. I encourage anyone who wants an adventure to read this book. The only thing left to say is: Welcome to the Hunger Games.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|My husband and I saw this concert on public television and wished we could have seen the concert in its entirety.  We were able to find it thru Amazon and have watched it so many times!  It is well worth the money!  The bonus footage is nice also.  We would certainly recommend this to ANYONE that is a Bee Gees fan!
B0013ND30W|5.0|I am a big fan of extra features... and this has it. I loved the feature of having some art fill the black on the screen while it was playing. The Blu-ray also has the option of leaving messages to loved ones or communicating while watching the movie with a family member who is also watching it. I haven't used this feature but I can only assume it would be exciting. I love the extra features this has. The whole story behind how they built the Sleeping Beauty attraction in Disneyland Resort was Awesome!    You can't beat having two of a good thing. I love this movie and I know not everyone has Blu-ray, yet, so having a DVD copy helps. I can lend this movie out to friends while still having my Blu-ray copy on me.    I thought it was an amazing buy for me. If your even a little fan, you'll enjoy it.
B000ZECQ08|2.0|At this point everyone who has read the books and watched the movies should know what to expect.  Added lovey scenes, and deleted important seens.  So buy this movie for the visuals and the acting.  Don't buy this if you're expecting to see the book take place on your TV.  p.s.  What's with the diner scene?
B001NEJXQE|2.0|I already own this book, just purchased the Kindle edition and it is disappointing. It just looks like a badly scanned pdf.
0307454541|2.0|Seemed somehow too busy with lots of uninteresting tid-bits.  Would you believe rape and murder could be dull, family dysfunction tedious?  The descriptions of corporate dealings, finances, etc. are not necessesarily my cup of tea, but I didn't feel moved even by what was supposed to be the most horrific parts of the book -  never felt on the edge of my seat, whipping pages over in anticipation, and didn't care too much about any of the characters. Just didn't surprise me, excite me, or touch me, personally, in any way.  Since it was considered a masterpiece in Sweden, maybe it lost too much in the translation to English. I did enjoy the Swedish setting and was interested in the reference to the Nazi involvement in Sweden.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|Not saying anything egative about the film itself, however it makes me mad when the public is duped into thinking that the \\"theatrical\\" version of the movie is the only cut of the movie that will be released on dvd and if you want the rest of the extras you have to buy it on blu ray. That is false advertising in my humble opinion.
0307386171|5.0|At 203 small pages, I devoured this book.  It was a great entertaining read; full of beautifully written dark humor and suffering and absolutely real living breathing characters...a winning combo  for me.  The story of a 1962 English couple's torturous wedding night, both of them virgins, as seen from each perspective, with flashbacks to their families, childhoods, meeting and wedding. It's hard to imagine the times being so different such a short time ago, but it adds a wonderful uniqueness to the story. I loved how the author was able to present the young couple in their stark nakedness, flawed but absolutely irresistable, without laying blame; McEwan is quite capable of making the reader a fully participating character in his story; there is nothing passive about this read, so hang on!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I would say Dexter is my favorite series.  If I could only pick one series, it would be 24 or Dexter.  The first season was darker, more gory and generally a bit more depressive than the other 3 seasons, but it was necessary to develop the character.  The first season also has a bit of the off-beat humor that typifies this show.  If you've never seen Dexter I highly recommend it.  Other shows currently playing that I watch: 24, The Office, Fringe, Eureka.

0307450570|2.0|For a book that says it's an Encyclopedia of Crafts, left a lot out.  There are so many notions and paper techniques left out.  Where's Iris folding, Tea Bag Folding, Quilting, just to name a few.  This book should have been titled differently.  An Encyclopedia should represent all of everything not just what was in her magazines.  Very disappointed!  Save your money and check out [...] for the instructions/ideas for free.
0307387178|4.0|Into the Wild was first brought to my attention when it came to film. I watched the movie and was shocked when Chris died at the end (this is not a spoiler, you find this out in the first chapter of the book) because I knew very little history about the story. I was so enthralled I went out and bought the book. Although it did take me a while to actually open the book, once I did I was halfway finished before I took a breath.<br /><br />Krakauer's writing is both thoughtful and insightful. I was impressed by the amount of research he was able to sift through and the stories he heard from the people who met Chris. I was also surprised that although it had been over a decade since he initially published the article in \\"Outsider,\\" he has obviously not stopped working or thinking about Chris. I was surprised by how much I could relate to Chris as well as how different we were. He did something incredible, and although a few oversights stopped him from walking out of Alaska alive, I don't think he failed. He lived for 2 years exactly how he wanted to after turning away from everything he had known. He went to Alaska and lived off the land until he was ready to leave. Although he did not leave, he was ready to walk out as what seemed to be a changed man and he never seemed to regret going into the bush.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. It was a great story and left me thinking about it for days after I had finished the last page.
B002KREVCO|3.0|This is an attractive package, but with less substance than what first comes off. Many of tracks one can find elsewhere, including previously released special packages (Bonfire, the dvd with Brian's 1983 Detroit gig, etc.).     Aside from the cutting most of the Let There Be Rock (Largo, MD 12-21-1981) guitar solo, and replacing the live You Shook Me All Night Long (11-18-1983 Detroit, MI) with BIB studio vocals, this is an okay package.    I'm waiting for a real, completely new release of older material.    The one plus this set does have is that it finally includes a remastered version of a song from '85, and a good one too!
B001FB55HQ|1.0|Here's the really short review: It's 2 hours of your life you'll never get back. Pretty much what they did was just repackage \\"Transformers\\" and release it again. So if you liked that mindless film . . . then you're a 3 year old on a sugar high and will watch anything with lots of flashing colors and loud noises.    In a nut shell, this is 2 hours of mindless CGI action sequences.  Then the \\"acting\\" bolts the computer generated sequences together. And that acting? Yeah, that was just dreadful. It was like scenes cut out of a daytime melodrama.    Were I watching this by myself, I would have turned it off half way through and found something else to do.    So here's how I made it to the end of this train-wreck:  Before watching it, my friends and I got on you-tube and found the video of Christian Bale freaking out on Peter Griffin from family guy. The whole way through the movie we were blurting out lines from that sketch.  \\"Do you want me to rip your [...] lights down?!?\\" response: \\"Those are Christmas lights; I put them up so everyone would be happy.\\"    So we'd all start laughing and try to forget how terrible this flick was.
0618918248|5.0|I deliberately chose this sentimental title to my review that \\"Dawkins is a genius!\\". It is not coherent with what Dawkins is trying to do in this book. I should be marveled not by the brilliance of Dawkins, but by the educational value of this book. This book shows me the availability of sound arguments in favor of maintaining a naturalistic worldview free of faith without reason. I always believed that institutionalized religion (or rather the institutionalized belief's in general; including non-religious ones) is bad for the world. I also firmly believed that governance and religion should be separated. Also I believed that children should not be forcibly indoctrinated in to their parent's belief system. However I never had my thoughts organized and could not articulate reasons for my belief before reading God Delusion.    Anyway, I would like to be little sentimental here and declare that Dawkins is a genius, and this book is simply brilliant.
B000002J03|4.0|A few weeks back a colleague of mine at work revealed that she had been a Led Zep devotee back in the day.  Since I think I could fairly describe this forty-something mom as a somewhat conservative, very religious soccer mom (not that there's anything wrong with that--really), I couldn't help but kid her a bit, \\"What? You actually listened to those Satanists?  I'm shocked, SHOCKED.\\"  Her reaction though suggested that she might not even have ever heard those accusations (since qualified and considerably downplayed by the man himself, I understand) that Jimmy Page bought into Aleister Crowley's beliefs (as oppose  to just buying his house).  Whatever the case, I would imagine that most fundamentalist former Zep fans would be repenting like sixty these days: not my co-worker though.  It was what it was apparently, and she had no regrets.    I sometimes have regrets, though, when it comes to the band.  I kinda wrote them off back in the day.  If there really was a battle of the ex-Yardbird guitar whizzes, I came down squarely in the Jeff Beck camp. (I wasn't figuring Clapton into the equation, since by that time, his own Yardbird stint seemed like ancient history).    Moreover, I felt that Led Zeppelin's first two albums were the kind of post-Cream excess that was not a healthy development.  Actually, I still wonder about that, since their particular heaviness, while still skillful and chop-laden, was soon followed by the sludge-and-scream bands that haunt us to this day on \\"classic rock,\\" reality television and other venues.    These days, I wonder if I would have become a bigger Zep fan if I'd but had a better sound system.  I remember finally hearing some of the technical trickery on \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" over at a friend's house.  \\"Oh, that's kinda trippy, I guess.\\"  I did find Robert Plant's vocals kind of mincing--distinctive certainly, but mincing--which is odd because I became a fan of his solo work in the '80s.  Unlike some critics of the era, I didn't have a problem with their exploiting blues readymades (lyrics AND riffs), since I was just getting into the genre myself.  Lawsuits notwithstanding, their musical tips of the hat to the old blues masters seems respectful enough even to this day.  And certainly as legit as sampling is in this day and age.    Trying to remember if I had an immediate issue with all the Hobbit stuff being thrown in.  It was the 60s after all, so what could you expect?  But I was moving away from all that stuff even at 17 or so.  I think I read THE HOBBIT and that was the last Tolkien for me.  Now quoting beat poets or something of that order: THAT would have caught my attention (and spoke to my pretensions).  Oh, and I had an issue with drum solos, so \\"Moby Dick\\" didn't bowl me over, despite the literary title.  But I think the real problem was that I had been hoping less riffing and more \\"Happenings Ten Years Time Ago\\" trippiness.  Yeah, that's probably it: the first two Zep albums inaugurated HEAVY and moved us out from and beyond trippy.  Personally, I had to be dragged kicking and screaming.    But that's all water under the dam now.  I can listen to this record and hear it as innovative (in many ways), exciting (much of the time) and nearly always sonically interesting.  It's more fun than I remembered, and it DOES sound good on a good system.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a nice workout video. I just wish it had more ab workout as it only devotes a sixth of the main workout to abs with its 3-2-1 minute strength-cardio-ab training.
3836501899|1.0|I am dissapointed that Amazon is selling this. It is a waste of money and time. The faded Polaroids are not interesting and not good enough quality to teach much about the process. Perhaps they have historical value, but I have no interest in documenting polaroid history, which is a process I found unacceptable in it's heyday.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I loved this Pixar movie but I was a little surprised by it. It really wasn't for kids, not that I'm a kid, I just expected a kid movie. Still enjoyed it though. I'll recommend it to my friends.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I saw Florence and the Machine last month at the Bowery and OOOOMG it was amazing!!  The best song on the album is \\"Dog Days Are Over\\" and it's just a great, great song, but when you see her live it's a completely different thing.  She started off really quiet and it just went and went and went until it was the loudest show I'd ever seen.  It was like she was crazy or on drugs, but it was really just the music.  If you haven't bought this album, you really should.

B0026BD2GK|5.0|THE WOODSTOCK EXPERIENCE is a great recorded memento of the first important concert by Carlos Santana and his original band, even if the version of his debut album here isn't quite as exemplary as the Legacy 30th Anniversary Edition and the CD recorded at Woodstock is missing some of the on-stage banter that took place at the show. At least every song the band played at Woodstock is included, including \\"Evil Ways\\", which was missing from a similar CD included as a bonus disc in a 2004 Limited Edition. Rumor has it that this is a limited-edition CD, so get it while you can.
1567184855|5.0|A mind-blowing account of life after death! This book cannot help but arouse and inform your conscious mind with details of the 'other side'. You start to look at your own life and connect the dots with the people around you who are connected in a more meaningful way than you could imagine. A definite - MUST READ for all those seeking answers.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|To be fair I am a huge fan of Pixar movies.  They constantly surprise me with the subtle details.  The movie looks wonderful in blu-ray.  However, I really do like the fact that it came with a digital version  to transfer to other devices.  I refuse to buy any blu-ray disk that does not provide at least digital copy of the movie.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Ok, I'll admit to not being done, but the book gives you so much to chew on, you honestly need to read a section then digest it. Of course there is the typical that will make you angry, etc., but it will also open your eyes. Be the change you want to be in this world. Start somewhere. My family has.
0143034901|5.0|\\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n is a 2001 fictional story and a worldwide best seller.  The book follows a young boy named Daniel and has possibly one of the best literary inventions of the decade the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\".<br /><br />The book takes place in Barcelona before the Spanish Civil War. Our hero, Daniel, is taken by his father to a secret place called the \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books\\" (as a book lover, this opening immediately got my attention). The \\"Cemetery\\" is a huge library of old books that no-one remembers run convincingly by a select few. The tradition is that everyone who get initiated is allowed to take one book and must do everything they can to protect it. Daniel selects a forgotten book called \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by an unknown author named Julian Carax. After he finishes reading the book he starts looking for other books by this author. During his search he comes across a man named Lain Coubert - which in the book is the Devil. Mr. Coubert has been buying Carax's books for many years only to set them on fire.<br /><br />There is much more to this book, interwoven stories about love gained, love lost success, and failures all somehow tied to the dead or alive Carax.<br /><br />I love books about books and this biblio-adventure is no different.<br /><br />Reading  \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" and couldn't put it down, even though Goth is not my genre.  The story is well rounded, combining politics, romance, horror and fantastic wit into a skillful narrative.  Even though the plot twists are by no means surprising the overall effect is immense.  Everything about this book is smooth, the language, prose, and twists leisurely unravel at a slower pace than one expects a book of such size to be.<br /><br />This is a superbly entertaining book, yet highly sophisticated.  Zaf&oacute;n is a master at spinning this complex yarn using Barcelona as a setting for night time pursuits and dark melodrama.<br /><br />My compliments to the translator Lucia Graves who, I believe, kept the story true and the jokes funny.<br /><br />For more book reviews please visit ManOfLaBook dot comrue and the jokes funny.

B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have now owned and used this tool for 3 months in all weather conditions but desert. I am not going to go through a long list of features because there are other reviews that cover that. Why I am writing is to help others with my experiences with the unit.     The Bezel is the second biggest problem with this device. I am not sure if it is sweat, touch, rain, etc. Sometimes it is just plain old wonky. That being said it is a minor frustration occasionally and the wealth of information that this device provides for the money more than makes up for it.    The software is bad, if it weren't for the fact that it works I would say it is worse than the Polar software. I have had numerous glitches with Polar software over the 8 years of using their devices and while it has more information it is far from user friendly. This isn't a review/bash of Polar just a point of comparison. The Garmin Software is not very configurable, and being web-based is always a mixed blessing. These two companies obviously aren't software companies. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. There are numerous software packages out there that will allow you to get around Garmin's data tracking offerings. Several are free or donationware, Sport Traks is the one I am using.    To round out the negatives I have 2 minor complaints. The watchband(sigh), at least they gave use the pieces to switch it to the supplied Velcro bands, which work nicely and fit around my winter gear. The last negative is the only feature I wish this device had, temperature.    Negatives aside, the pluses far out-weigh them. Using this device to check your pacing makes training and racing smarter. You have several configurable pacing options. The two I use most is lap pace and current pace. Lap pace gives you a pace over your current lap, which makes it a reasonably stable metric. Current pace gives you your pace at the moment, it bounces around a bit, particularly after you take a turn. Use these two together and you canmodify your pace all day long.    I am not sure if this has been mentioned before but the displays are VERY configurable. You can turn on or off display windows so you don't have to scroll trough them if they are unnecessary to you. Each window is completely configurable. There are three data fields in each window and you can select which metric you wish each to display. If you wanted you could have all the fields display the same information---I'm not sure why anyone would want to do this, but that is how flexible the display is.    I am looking forward to Spring when I break out my road bike and strap this device on it.    Would I recommend this device? You bet, after three months use I am very pleased and will be buying one for my wife.    Ok, Ok, one more complaint. Why only one color and this color to boot? I am sure it was chosen as gender neutral, but it still strikes me as a bit on the feminine side.
B00164EAC8|3.0|I think this film gets a bum rap. It's not good, but it's not super bad. It's at least a chance to put your brain in a jar and eat popcorn. Also it re-invigorated an international interest in Godzilla which led to the old movies having western DVD releases.<br /><br />This is a modern day B-Movie, and more a take on \\"Beast From 20,000 Fathoms\\" than \\"Godzilla\\". The creature (or 'GINO' aka: 'Godzilla In Name Only') looks cool, but he's no Godzilla. The human characters work with what they've got. For all that's apparently going on, all Godzilla does through-out the film is run. Then maybe walk, or at one point crawl, but then it's back to running. There's no real city destruction bar one or two buildings he walks through (which we don't get to see much of). In fact the military does more damage to New York than he does! Or 'she' does?<br /><br />This is off-set by the \\"summer blockbuster\\" feel of the film where you have to stop thinking and let the barrage of visuals overwhelm you. The Blu-Ray release captures this very well. The CGI looks old, but still good. I was surprised to find the sound impressing me more with lots of lovely bass. GINO sounds heavy with each footfall and your speakers will get put through their paces during the chase scenes.<br /><br />There are extras on the disc, but a lot of it is recycled from the DVD release. These include a very short making of video, a music video, and visual effects commentary. New material includes a video featuring some of Godzilla's greatest fight scenes, but this is more of a trailer for other Godzilla DVDs. An announcer talks over each battle explaining the story, but gets his facts wrong in places.<br /><br />There is a quiz about the film, but it's not very good. On my first try, the first two answers were New York. Finally there's a `movieIQ' feature. This means during the film it can list details of characters and actors as they appear. I suppose this would come in handy if you forgot an actor's name and wanted to be reminded of the other film they were in which you remember.<br /><br />If you have a PS3 there is a Digital Copy of the movie available. You download to your PS3 and can then transfer it to a PSP for portable stomping. This is pretty neat, and makes portable transfers of movies a little easier for people who don't want to have to rip and compress a DVD. You just need to own a PS3 and a PSP instead!<br /><br />The extras on this Blu-Ray aren't great, but at least they're trying new things, and that's better than nothing!

B002PMV9FG|1.0|This is my second favorite of the Harry Potter books, but my absolute least favorite of the movies, by far.  Acting was stilted.  Too many story changes.  No \\"magic\\" at all felt during the movie. I know it should be dark because of the story line, but the director and whoever wrote the screenplay totally ruined it for me.    At the end of the book, when Severus yells at Harry... \\"don't call me coward!\\"  That is a climactic moment and it was completely left out of the movie!  The whole backstory of Voldemorts mother and childhood  are left out.    If it was too much movie for one book, then pick up the pace.  It totally dragged. I will not watch it again.    If this same director is doing the next two movies, I won't bother seeing them.  I would give the movie ZERO stars if I could.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|There is no doubt about how horrible the death of Michael Jackson has hit the world wide open. There were so many people that personally stepped on him from his personal problems the past several years. Whether it was his child molestation trials, or because of media heartbreak from being a tabloid target. Yet, with all the things that were going on, it has definitely been so easy to simply forget how inspirational he has been for so many entertainers from Beyonce' to Britney Spears, all the way to today's entertainers that want to move like the way he danced his moonwalk. He truly was a trademark on the music industry. But, there are those whom are now looking for a Michael Jackson album of their own for their music library. Well, this is a simple starter.<br /><br />Michael Jackson's 2003 Number Ones is a simple starter reflection of whom Jackson was, with his biggest hits from his solo efforts on Sony from 1979's Off The Wall, all the way to his final record, the lackluster Invincible from 2001. The collection of songs have all been remastered well, and include a lot of great songs from Jackson's catalog of songs. The collection does have some faults though by overlooking a few of his #1 hits, nevertheless. Still, most of the classics are here including Billie Jean, his deep and soulful Man In The Mirror, Bad and his 1991 classic Black Or White, which I loved the video for years ago. Sadly though, there were a few #1 songs of his that were unfortunately overshadowed like his duet with Paul McCartney, Say, Say, Say, Leave Me Alone, as well as his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Scream. That actually though wasn't overshadowed on Janet's recently issued Number Ones collection last month. Instead, some of his lesser-known songs were highlighted like Break Of Dawn and his final original released recording before his death, One More Chance, which was a fair song, but anything outrageous.<br /><br />All in all, despite a few flaws, Michael Jackson's Number Ones is still a simple and strong reintroduction to why Michael Jackson was one of the greatest entertainers' of the classic MTV generation. If you are a much more hard core Michael Jackson fan, I'd suggest a better Michael Jackson collection like 2005's Essential Michael Jackson. But if you've never owned a collection of songs from the late King Of Pop, than this would be a nice place to start.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B-<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Remastering: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-nd strong reintroduction to why Michael Jackson was one of the greatest entertainers' of the classic MTV generation.

0439023491|4.0|After defying the Capitol and President Snow in the last Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta have returned home as joint victors - an unprecedented achievement - to find they are still in as much danger as before. This danger however is not such an in-your-face-fight-for-survival, but nonetheless deadly with exponentially more lives at stake. All Katniss wants to is to return home after the Games and resume her former life: hunting with Gale, arguing with the black market vendors of the Hob, and generally keeping a low profile. That dream however is shattered after President Snow makes it perfectly clear to Katniss that he expects to be fully convinced of her undying love for Peeta not just on their Victory Tour but permanently. And if she can't? The consequences won't just be limited to herself this time: her family and friends would be the Capitol's next targets.<br /><br />On thing I really like about Suzanne Collins' books is that I never really know what will happen next. Her constant twists and turns catch me of guard and I really, really like that. Despite the somewhat rushed, horribly abrupt cliff-hanger ending (why do authors ever feel the need to do that to their readers?!?) Catching Fire held me from the get-go and played havoc with my emotions the entire ride.<br /><br />So much about Catching Fire is focused on relationships and barring Katniss' interactions with Gale and Peeta, I eagerly anticipated any scene where Cinna came into play. The man is a genius designer and I couldn't be more impressed with his subtly and symbolism in everything he creates for Katniss. A talented designer and truly committed to Katniss, Cinna is one stylist I'd want in my corner too.<br /><br />I've read many reviews that compalined that the pacing in this book was off - to which I say, not off, just different. For a while Katniss really doesn't do much of anything besides try to figure out where she stands on a variety of subjects: how she feels about Gale, how she feels about Peeta, how to convince the President she really isn't trying to foment a rebellion, etc., etc. This is a drastic change of pace in one sense, because Katniss isn't physically fighting for her life every at every turn. Instead, she's waging war on a variety of fronts, only now she has to think about how to keep her family and friends alive too. So for a 17 year old, she's got a lot on her plate and I, for one, was intrigued by her inner turmoil and struggle to define herself. Which maybe makes Catching Fire more of a coming of age/determination story than a dystopian survival novel, but differences aside, I loved it and can't wait to see where that cliff-hanger ending will go next.Peeta, how to convince the President she really isn't trying to foment a rebellion, etc., etc. This is a drastic change of pace in one sense, because Katniss isn't physically fighting for her life every at every turn.

B0029LHW68|4.0|I understand that some people will not like this new sound from 30 seconds to mars, but I can definitely say that it's not as bad as you might think. Sure the random chanting from the group of kids is certainly annoying especially in EVERY song, and Jared's pathetic screaming also is misused alot, but if you block all that out than it isnt that bad of a listen. I also hate the whispering in most of the songs. The reason why I like it is because of the great song structure besides all those negative things and that it's such an uplifting album oppose to his last effort. I think most fans and even new fans should give this album a listen because it truly is a good one.

B001C4CI8A|2.0|This is \\"cool\\" movie, good acting and everything, nice to see Leo Decaprio in this role, but overall the plot is rather dry and I was expecting a lot more. Really wanted to like the movie, but plot does not keep you interested for long.  Visually nice looking film, but at the end, I wonder what the point of it all is.
B0006N2EZ0|3.0|This film really stretches credulity with it's weak plot, but the action is fair.    At least you sort of get Whitney Houston in her prime, before Bobby Brown and the drugs.  Not an actress, but a fabulous singer, she is miscast.    Kevin Costner does his best to generate heat between them, but Whitney gives the impression that she is reading her love lines over his shoulder.    I bought this DVD used at a really low price, so I can't say I'm super disappointed.    You do the same.
B002HK9IDQ|4.0|great movie. the only thing that might throw you off from getting this edition is the only subtitles on the disc are in Portuguese. its pretty fun the first time through, but if you need them in any other language you might want to look for another edition.
B00004RF83|4.0|Good plot; original at the time.    The casting was excellent with one exception: Ava Gardner.  She was way past her prime, and the years of smoking and alcohol show on her face.  It was not believable that Burt (and later Kirk) would think she was one fabulous babe and be in love with her.  (See Ava in One Touch Of Venus -- buy this film!)    Her role is vital in stopping Lancaster, therefore this part should have been given to someone with the looks of Grace Kelly.    Other than that, the story does stand the test of time -- with minor changes to the script, today we might be rooting for Lancaster.
0307454541|1.0|I picked up this book in the airport after reading how popular it was in a magazine.  The story grabbed me enough to finish it (though would I have finished if I wasn't stuck on a plane for 5 hours?).  I also kept thinking that surely the book would improve as it was such a best-seller.  But I'm left feeling very disturbed that a book with such graphically described sadistic violence against women would be so popular.  Why would you want to read stuff like that as entertainment?  The fact that this book is a internationally popular book makes me sad indeed.  The book puts in 4-5 statistics on violent crime against women at the beginning of some of the chapters.  But is comes off as a way of trying to justify itself.  Entertainment by fictional descriptions of horrific crimes against women- that is what this book is about.  Yuck.  I wont be reading anymore by this author.
B00021R7CG|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the execution of the plot, and perfectly cast actors.  Especially the Powers Booth and Rebecca De Mornay interaction in the cockpit of the B-52.

B000UG78NG|5.0|By the time I got to the end of this book, quite a lot had happened - and I was ready for the real story to begin. By no means am I saying this is simply 600+ pages of background information.  It contained multiple stories within its pages: The Wandering Minstrel Troupe, The Street Rat, The School of Magic, The Quest, The Innkeeper is More Than an Innkeeper ... and many sub-stories within each major story.  At the end of the book, I was both sated by the different stories and left with the impression that this was just the beginning.<br /><br />Not every author can do that; it would be exhausting if everyone could.  The way it's done here is brilliant.<br /><br />I picked up this book as a kindle novel 8 months ago and put off reading it.  The next book, Wise Man's Fear, is due to be released mid-year 2010 ... and I'm anxiously awaiting the next installment.  That one will not be put off but immediately savored.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|Okay, let's start this review off by stating emphatically that this is a review of the just finished season 4 on Showtime and not the DVD release itself, which except for any special features or add bonus material is going to be the exact same thing that you just finished up watching today (Sunday, December 13th, 2009), so let's not split any hairs concerning reviewing the actual series as it played out on Showtime and the DVD release. It is pretty much the same thing, except of course if they change the ending when the DVD comes out.<br /><br />I have enjoyed every season of [[ASIN:B000Q6GUW0 Dexter: The First Season]] from the very first episode to this latest \\"mind-blowing\\" ending that I just finished watching a mere 15 minutes ago. Now I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't seen the ending, but I am fairly certain that it is going to take me several days to get my head wrapped around the last scene of this season. DAMN those writers and producers anyhow, now I have to wait several more months before the start of season 5. Talk about your torture!<br /><br />Michael C. Hall is brilliant in the role of Dexter Morgan and as a matter of fact, everyone in the series is absolutely fantastic. Even your minor or supporting role characters are simply outstanding. Of course I have to throw out a special Kudos to the actor who portrays Masuka as he is with-out-a-doubt my favorite character on the series with the exception of Dexter himself, which I personally just love his inner monologues. Masuka is absolutely brilliant and he really adds a hilarious comical addition to every scene he's in, even when he isn't trying to be funny.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br /><br />Some of the interesting plot points of season 4:<br /><br />1. Quinn starts to become a lot more curious about Dexter than he should be.<br /><br />2. Dexter's search for answers from a like-minded individual actually causes the seasons ending climactic mind-f***.<br /><br />3. Deb's obsession with finding the CI (confidential informant) that her father Harry was seeing.<br /><br />4. Dexter's constant juggling of; work, family, and his Dark Passenger, and the problems that arise because of it.<br /><br />5. The fact that Trinity is actually incorrectly named, which brings up an interesting point; what would you have called him instead?<br /><br />As far as next season, here are a couple of logical thoughts that I had:<br /><br />1. Since Dexter and Rita where just married, and it is doubtful that Dexter adopted Aston and Cody, it might be probable that Rita's mother may come back into the picture and try to get the kids but will only be able to try and get the older two since Dexter is the father of Harrison and would have all parental rights to him. Where I don't believe he may be that assured with Aston and Cody.<br /><br />2. Of course this is going to affect the older kids in a HUGE way, so that opens the potential to follow along with the storyline that runs rampant through the Dexter novels where Aston and Cody are budding young serial killers themselves and they see the same in Dexter so he start to mentor them like Harry did for him.<br /><br />3. Someone is obviously going to have to step in and help raise the kids since Dexter has to \\"work\\" at both jobs. Therefore, this opens up the possibility for another love interest, although it won't come to fruition until the last couple of episodes of season 5 at the earliest. Deb won't work because of her job, so this is why I get the feeling the mother-in-law may be coming back into the picture. If only for a short time.<br /><br />4. Dexter is really going to feel this, and is going to shut down for awhile towards co-workers and Deb.<br /><br />5. Quinn is really going to start getting suspicious of Dexter and will turn into a version of Dokes.<br /><br />6. Dexter is not going to get sloppy as I felt he did in season 5. He is going to actually be a lot more careful and focused as a way to shut out thepain.<br /><br />7. I would like to see a female serial killer introduced into the story in such a way that she is actually a sympathetic type and kind of like Dexter in that she only targets men or women that say for example, harm children. Wouldn't this be kind of like the ultimate love interest for Dexter?<br /><br />8. The opening episode of season 5 has to be a direct continuation of the last episode of season 4, perhaps where Deb comes running up to the house and Dexter is sitting there holding Harrison and covered in blood.<br /><br />9.

B001OQCV24|5.0|Good movie! what else is there to say go see it
B001OQCV24|2.0|The movie delivers on the visuals very well, and makes obvious points about who would be saved if it came down to \\"arks\\" for humans -- the super-rich and the politicians, plus a handful of army enforcer drones. But the script is awful, and loaded with every sappy possible cliche. I'm not sure what Thandie Newton was even doing in the movie. Her role must have been cut. As much as the premise is unlikely, the movie itself further strains credulity -- cars narrowly escaping ever-widening fissures, planes narrowly missing towers, the high peaks of the Himalayas inundated by tsunamis, every thing happening with a second to spare... it doesn't add to the suspense to do things like this. Didn't anybody have an imagination beyond FX? Didn't John Cusack used to be able to act? Or is he Botoxed beyond facial expressions now?
B002T921AC|5.0|I love the cd... the music is so good and I can not wait for more from him.
B00005I44H|5.0|What a combination! - Perahia and Mozart.  I have the complete Mozart Sonatas played by Daniel Barenboim.  Barenboim, like Perahia, also conducts when he plays the Concerti, yet Perahia's musicianship is preferable to Barenboim.  I have a few of Perahia's Mozart Sonatas, and I plan to purchase all of his recordings in that area as well - despite already owning the Barenboim editions.  I also believe that Perahia is the best interpreter of Beethoven's Sonatas.  His reworking of the \\"Moonlight\\" with a faster tempo on the Adagio than is common to most pianists, is simply sublime.    So what have we here?  Well, given Perahia's propensity for reworking the classics to their difinitive excellence - he does not disappoint here.  He includes his own cadenzas, and several written by Mozart himself.  Cadenzas, in my opinion are a must for any great performance of a piano concerto, and Perahia's contributions here are wonderful.  Some pianists leave them out, and that is a shame.  They contribute a personal feel to the music, making them the performer's own.    Perahia correctly plays the first four concertos on a piano as opposed to a harpsichord, for which they were written.  Mozart would have preferred this, I would guess.  Besides, they sound a whole lot better on a piano.  I've heard them played on both.    Complete collections are expensive, and this is no exception.  However, this collection is perhaps one of the most listenable sets of classical music ever put down on CD.  The price is well worth the enjoyment you will get out of this set.  I used to purchase the budget classical CDs you can find in most music stores - not wanting to spend too much money on the music, but still have some performances that I could listen to over and over again (edit - and wouldn't you know it, a lot of those budget CDs that are now out of print are worth more than prime priced CDs that are still issued.  Hang onto them!). Yet, when I purchased this set, I gave away all of the budget editions I had purchased over the years (edit - oh, how I wish I'd hung onto them).  Perahia's editions are all I will ever need.
B00000JNO2|5.0|This album was my introduction to Lynyrd Skynyrd. I didn't really get into them until I was 22. I'd always dismiss them as just another Southern Rock band that wasn't as talented as the Allman Brothers Band and had a few hits. I was completely wrong.<br /><br />No, they're not as musical as the Allmans, but they make up for it with STRONG songwriting. And I think that oughta count. There's a lot of misconceptions with Skynyrd. They weren't a bunch of yahoo rednecks. They were hippies from the South that wrote about the misconceptions and unforgiving stereotypes that people made about their hometown. I'm from Eastern Kentucky, and there are some great people down here. Yes, there are rednecks, but not everyone from the south is a redneck. That's what Skynyrd was singing about, and for that, I respect them.<br /><br />Also, they were a great rock and roll band, and this album is a great rock and roll record. While it is missing a guitarist, the band sounds incredibly tight by this period. Allen Collins shines on this album, having co-written 7 of the 9 songs with Ronnie Van Zant. The title track, Trust, and Double Trouble all have that \\"whiskey soaked\\" blues flavor that the band has done before, but perfected this time. Great hooks, powerful performances abound.<br /><br />Every Mother's Son is, in my opinion, one of the Top 5 songs the band have ever written. A fantastic song about the rise and fall of some of their great friends, whether it's women, money, or drugs that corrupted them. This also has one of their best ballads, All I Can Do Is Write About It, the most bluegrassy thing the band has ever done. The violin always gets to me in this one. Beautiful stuff.<br /><br />And let's not forget the deep album tracks. Got The Same Ol' Blues is a fantastic J.J. Cale cover, and Cry For The Bad Man just smokes. Even without an extra guitarist, this band cooks.<br /><br />It might not be their best album (It still is pretty good), but it's definetly a keeper. Buy it if you love rock and roll.you love rock and roll.
0307474275|2.0|Finally, I decided to pick up this novel after hearing about all the controversy it caused.  It's an interesting read, to be sure, and the opening scene where Langdon and Neveu escape from the heavily guarded Louvre Museum in Paris is excellent.  It's the rest of the book I can't get into.  The premise is that the murder of a priest is somehow connected to Neveu and her family being the descendents of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene and a secret society within the Catholic Church wants to prevent that knowledge from getting into the open.  I can see where taking liberties with Jesus' family tree might offend some traditionalist Catholics but, honestly, if I were Catholic I'd be far more offended by the pedophile priest scandals than this book.  I tried reading Brown's novel \\"Deception Point\\" and had the same problem.  It starts of pretty good, then descends into boring territory and I stop reading.
B000062XE1|3.0|While I enjoyed watching \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" the plot moved slowly and left out some crucial parts.  There is a focus on the homo-erotic side of the story, especially in the scene with Alan Campbell.  I have been trying to get my students to see the text from both a straight and a homosexual viewpoint, and to discuss why Wilde did not state the reason Gray is able to blackmail Campbell. This version is therefore too black-and-white to fit into classroom discussions about seeing art from multiple perspectives.  For high school students in a conservative part of the country, the 1945 movie version is probably the better (safer) version to play.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I first saw and heard of David Garret on Connecticut Public TV (CPTV) when they played his live performance in Berlin.  After viewing that, I was hooked!  It's the perfect blend of classical and rock and I'm sure anyone of any age will definitely enjoy listening.  I'm very excited because I will be seeing him live on February 19, 2010 in Hartford, CT.  His story is amazing and his artistic use of his talent is even more amazing!!
B002K0WBYG|4.0|Sandra Bullock is a fairly decent actress and it shows well in this movie.  She comes close to playing a dominant boss but not quite the same as some of the critters I worked for from an earlier life.  Her assistant is a real flunky and needed little help commanding his role.  The development of the story was easy and smooth and not exactly easy to predetermine the outcome.  The scenery is just plain fantastic and I would love to live in a community such as that one.  It is so nice to sit down for a few frames and watch a movie that does not make you think too much or contain too much violence et al.  This is just a friendly movie that most adults could enjoy.<br /><br />One item that stressed my humble mind is attempting to ascertain the difference between Blu-ray (BD) and regular DVD disks.  Some suggest that Blu-ray provides a picture and sound that is 6 times better than regular DVD.  That is an exageration of at least 4 to 5.  Maybe the old eyes and ears cannot tell the difference.  Maybe regular will suffice for home theaters.
1591841992|3.0|I was looking for a few new tricks, but this book isn't quite it. It's a good introductory book about the basics and how to illustrations can convey ideas. If you've been in management consulting before or even if you're already visually inclined, you could write this book.
031606792X|5.0|In my opinion, any writer that can get anyone to read 4 books in a week is very talented.  The books kept me very interest and  yearning to know what would come next. I am an avid reader and I honestly can say that Meyer IS A GREAT STORYTELLER! THESE BOOKS ARE FOR THOSE WHO LOVE FICTION...THOSE WHO CAN LEAVE ALL PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS AT THE DOOR AND SEE THESE BOOKS FOR WHAT THEY ARE...AN ESCAPE (sorry for the caps...used for emphasis)    I am 34 and I started reading the series after seeing twilight (the movie)...I liked the movie and knew that any movie that is based on a book...the book is usually better.... (i.e. Misery)...I read all 4 books in a week and I have to say, I LOVED all of them...I got totally lost in the books. In my humble opinion, the purpose of reading fictions is to escape from our daily grinds.    SPOILERS*************    A lot people did not like the fact that Bella got pregnant early on in the book and wanted to keep the baby, but for me that was when I regained the respect for her that I lost in Eclipse.  She could have easily given in to all the pressure and aborted the baby (I am pro-choice), but for the 1st time everything was not about Edward or anyone else...this was about her... what she wanted and/or needed and that to me is when her character matured...being mature entails doing what is best and not what is easy and/or popular.    I very much enjoyed escaping to Forks, WA everyday for 7 hours and I did this while having a full-time job and going to school full-time...this is how much I enjoyed the books and needed the escape. I am not sure why everyone hated any of these books, because I thought Meyer ended the story the best way that she could, while leaving room to continue the series if she wanted to.      This is a WORK OF FICTION, and I sincerely don't think that when Meyer wrote these books that she was thinking that her books would be in the same realm as Pride and Prejudice, etc...    I loved all the characters ...they are complex... they are funny, annoying, loyal to a fault, sarcastic, innocent, naïve, funny, strong and often very relatable.    I would have loved to know more about Emmett and Esme, but again, if Meyer wanted to, she could write a book about each of the characters and that is what I think makes her brilliant.     For those who said Jacob imprinting on Nessie makes him a pedophile is absurd...I think we see this from a western's perspective and I think Meyer knew that would be the case, because she spent a lot of time talking about the concept of imprinting and Quileutes culture and beliefs...again, she touched on the subject by having \\"Edward\\" clarify that Jacobs thoughts were pure (which annoyed me a little because I think she spent way to0 much time trying to justify it).    Often as westerners, we tend to classify things we do not understand as bad or evil...cast it in a negative light--I think that is why intercultural relations are so important and we all should be open to learning and understanding other people--even if we do not agree with them.     I thought it was a brillant move on Meyer's part to have Jacob imprint on Nessie...it was something that was unexpected--I thought he would end up with Leah and for a moment I thought maybe the girl he met at the park (Lizzie) would be the one--not in my wildness dream did I think it would be Bella's daughter, especially when he was intent on killing her....that was a wow moment for me--I appreciated the surprise.    I always knew Bella would end up Edward and not Jacob, but I was thrill that the author kept Jacob in her life--their friendship was too powerful for her to have ended the book with Bella saying \\"I choose Edward, too bad for your Jake...have a nice life\\".  I would have been pissed off; because they had a bond that even the love of her life (EDWARD) acknowledged was beyond his comprehension and Meyer showed that bond by the fact that Bella was willing to trust the one person that she was willing to die forto Jacob.    I loved these books because it reminded me of a life lesson that I think that we as humans often forget--we do not have to accept the status quo--it was understood that Werewolves and Vampires could not be anything but mortal enemies and that was not the case.     As cliché as it may sound, maybe love does indeed conquer all and if we all could love like Bella, Edward, Jacob and the Cullens..., would we be in Afghanistan or Iraq right now where innocent lives are lost each day on both sides?  I would like to think not.    Not all books are written to be Literary Masterpieces as not all movies are made to win Oscars--that being said I LOVED THE BOOKS AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING MORE OF MEYER's books.    I think in a few years I might read the books again and I hope that Meyer finishes Midnight Sun and continue the series--I will be starting an MBA program and Law school in February and I will need the escape and that is exactly what her books do.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out and just loved it. It was a winter night and as we walked out of the theater big flakes of snow were falling in the quiet night. It was such a beautiful finish to this wonderful movie. I was truly mesmerized by August Rush, and the snow added the perfect touch to the evening. I have since ordered it on DVD to add to my 'favorites' collection. This is a must see!
B002NANLCE|1.0|I'm a fan of the TV series of the same name that is loosely based on this novel and bought the Kindle version of the book to see how the original story was presented.  What a disappointment. The premise of a time travel incident based on an unexpected event involving the LHC is intriguing.  Sadly, the execution of the premise was just awful, bordering on boring.    Sawyer's writing is amateurish, at best.  The narrative is muddled and confusing.  The storyline meanders aimlessly between a bad time travel sci-fi story, an unconvincing murder mystery and a vaguely described love triangle played out by a half dozen unmotivated characters who sleepwalk through their dialogue.  The main characters, two physicists at CERN's Large Hadron Collider project, display a knowledge of \\"physics\\" typical of what is found on Internet alt-sci sites.  Sawyer tosses Dr. Frank Tipler's name into the fray as a discussion between the two physicists - and has one explain to the other just who Tipler is...as if real physicists wouldn't know who Tipler is (he's a well known mathematical physicist at Tulane University).  The rest of the science involves nothing more than preachy New Age mysticism.      If you want to see how the story should have been developed, watch the TV series.  If you want to see how a good idea can become a boring waste of time, buy the book.
0679405631|5.0|I discovered author Wilkie Collins this year while browsing on Amazon. I ordered The Woman In White and immediately became a Collins fan. This 1860 novel has it all--mystery, drama, suspense, strong characters, and romance. What more could a reader want? I highly recommend it to those who are looking for a classic literary masterpiece that has stood the test of time.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|I'm very pleased with my purchase.  It was exactly what I asked for.  I received it very quickly and it was packaged very safely.  This is not a mainstream movie and I didn't think I would be able to find it but I found it here!  Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!!!
B000B8QG22|5.0|A surprise and a half.  I'm not normally one for war movies, but Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors and I've heard some good things about this movie.<br /><br />Williams plays Adrian Cronauer, a new Disk Jockey that is shipped to Vietnam to help bring humor to the Armed Forces stationed over there, during the Vietnam War.  He becomes extremely popular with the soldiers, but almost immediately is seen as a problem by the officers.  This upbeat, funny guy starts to change as he experiences the horrors of the Vietnam War, up close and personal.<br /><br />The first part of the movie was an excellent chance for Williams's stand-up to shine.  He is able to act more like himself than any of his other characters have allowed him to.  But, the movie also shows the Vietnam War for what it really was.  Even though this movie is considered a comedy, it still shows that the war was an ugly thing.  Overall, it was an amazing job done by everyone involved with the movie.<br /><br />A must see.
0307716988|5.0|After Michael's tragic death, I heard that Moonwalk was going to be re-printed. I had never had a chance to read it, and I was only 7 years old when it was first released in 1988. When I read this book, I smiled, laughed and cried, his words really touched my heart. I couldn't put this book down, and I wish he'd written a second one to pick up where this one left off. This was written 5 years before the horrible scandals and before his marriages. I wish that those scandals hadn't tarnished his reputation the way they did, I wish the whole thing had never happened. I know it all really hurt him. And he doesn't even discuss his vitaligo skin disorder in this book, I guess at the time he wasn't ready, and was still trying to hide it. Obviously he was very sensitive about it. Poor guy! He was a human being like the rest of us, and he had amazing gifts, and seems to have had a very loving, generous, sensitive, gentle soul. I miss him. His music and videos are connected to a lot of happy childhood memories for me, and it was so hard to see him go, especially before his time, just as he was about to make his comeback, and right in the middle of raising the children that he'd wanted for so long. After reading this book, I feel that I knew him. I wish I had. I'm glad there were good times in his life, because on the news and in the media, I only heard about the worst. I'm so sorry that he was treated so badly by the public when all he wanted to do was give, and make people happy by sharing his gifts. He was a truly brilliant artist, who will be sorely missed. He wrote a wonderful book, and had an amazing life. I'm sorry his life ended much too soon. I miss you, Mike. I still can't believe you're gone.
B00194W6V2|2.0|I expected great things from this book because the synopsis and everything they said on newspapers and magazines over here sounded extreme. I even asked some of my friends who had actually read it before and they all complimented PS, I Love You. To my dismay, this book turned out to be quite disappointing.    There was nothing wrong with the plot or how Cecelia writes. Honestly, I really loved the story itself because it was touching, heartfelt and made us appreciate the people we love even more. It also dealt with getting over a great loss, learning to live on your own and finding happiness. The story flew from the beginning to the end, maybe not in a perfect way, but nice enough. However, there were certain reasons why I didn't enjoy it. First it was too typical and Cecelia didn't add anything to make the story stand out. Second, there were so many parts about Holly's mourning, therefore it became draggy in the middle of the book. I was a bit sad that there was no climax, like the story could go on and on and on forever.    About the character, I really liked Gerry. My favorite parts of the books must be the flashbacks and the letters he left Holly. He was such a sweet, thoughtful, loving guy who cared more for his wife than himself. I was very touched when I read on how he sneaked out of the hospital to book Holly a trip he thought would make her happy. So, guess whom I disliked? Holly. I knew that she was hurt and depressed after the love of her life had gone but man, she was weak to the point of annoyance. She cried at times I thought she shouldn't and was way to dependent.    Overall this book is an okay one. You may or may not have fun reading this, I cannot tell :  
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie which has become a holiday tradition in so many households looks simply amazing on Blu-ray in high definition. Detail is high and the flesh tones look solid with colors vibrant and black levels pleasing. Overall the print is in good shape with some nicks few and far between but particularly evident in long distance shots, but on the whole the Blu-ray looks good and certainly better than an upscaled DVD. The audio track is presented in a Dolby Digital 2-channel audio track and is very front heavy with the majority of the sound coming from the center channel speaker with very little from the rear. Dialogue is clean and on the whole this Blu-ray disc sounds fine.<br />One area that is disappointing is the supplemental package though we do get a worthwhile commentary track. I was particularly interestef to hear what actors Beverly D'Angelo, Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Johnny Galecki, director Jeremiah Chechik, and producer Matty Simmons had to say in their commentary track and thankfully we get a humorous and fun track full of anectdotal recollections. The only other extra is a standard definition trailer for the movie.<br />But what of the movie itself? The movie is already a Christmas classic with the gags coming quick and fast. I have always thought Chevy Chase to be a hit and miss comedian but when Chase is in top form he is hilarious and thankfully Chase is firing on all cylinders in this movie harkening back to his other successes such as \\"Seems Like Old Times,\\" \\"Foul Play,\\"and \\"Fletch.\\" The movie follows the manic antics surrounding the efforts by Clark Griswald to put together the perfect family Christmas, an effort that does not go entirely as planned. If you've seen the other Griswald adventures you will have a good idea of what to expect as all of Clark's efforts unravel on the way to a satisfying conclusion. This movie and Blu-ray is well worth your time and money.
1595141715|5.0|I always say that I love reading sad books and there were some I would dwell on for weeks or months because I couldn't get it out of my mind. Th1rteen R3asons Why was one of those. When my friend showed me this one, I knew it was going to leave me with an impact. And I was not disappointed.    Firstly, this book was very different. I know lots of authors have written about suicide, but Jay Asher had his very own way. He didn't tell the story in third point of view nor did he let his character bury her tragic secret into her journal. Instead, she recorded her last words and spread them around, making those who were one of the 13 reasons why she chose to end her life feel like she was step by step taking them along her death. That explained how I, a sucker for romance only, fell deeply in love with this book (and absolutely never fall out of it).    Second goes with the story line. It was just...awesome. Hannah's heartbreaking story went on without a flaw. Everything made perfect sense. It grew more thrilling page after page. Each side of every tape brought a different secret, only to be more shocking and unbelievable. On reading this book I had this dilemma: I wanted to stop because the story was so cruel and hurtful, yet I couldn't but crave to know what else those people did to pain poor Hannah. I guess that was what made the book. Jay took us for a ride of mixed emotions just like his male lead, Clay was excited when he received the package, then panic on playing first few steps, later doubtful and scared, and finally, lost in deep guilt and sorrow.    Clay's feelings for Hannah developed through the story in a way that I found interesting. The backflap said Hannah was Clay's first love but in the beginning it seemed to me that she was only a friend. Only after a few tapes did he himself confessed how he was into her, how shy and hesitant he was to make a move and how he hated himself for not trying harder to to help Hannah out. It was great because that matched with the book's rhythm. Things started at a certain stage and they logically grew stronger and deeper.    I really hated the people who was in Hannah's tapes, disgusted to be exact. There aren't enough bad words to describe them, those who unawarely ruined a girl's beautiful life. Then again, I loved them because they were so real. And more importantly they made not only Clay but all the readers realize how we effect people's life. Sometimes what we think isn't worth making a fuss over is what makes an impact on others. A fault we blame on someone to make ourself feel better, a rumor we spread just for fun, a stupid list we consider harmless, a time being fake and mean, a few thoughtless words, all could turn a person's life upside down. The book also taught us one thing: if we do care for someone, try our best to protect and help them. Because, simply, we don't want to end up like once half-hearted Clay.    The last thing I want to mention is the ending. It was very touching, especially the part when the last tape ended and Hannah whispered \\"Thank You\\" (Seriously, I was on the verge of crying). Besides, even though it was really sad, the book didn't leave us in pain, on the contrary, gave us hope in a better world after Hannah's death. We could close Thirteen Reasons Why with a smile after a lot of crying because we knew Skye would not be a second Hannah, all thanks to Clay.    So...what more can I say? If you don't read this book, it's your loss!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Nice sequel.  My kids loved it!  You can't go wrong with Spiderman. Really!
0802798225|4.0|This book is truly a page tuner. Everything was exciting from the very first pages, and only got better in the next. The point of view switched between Alex and Brittany, so you'll get to know both of them immediately. Their first few encounters did not sound very original, but I adored how they flowed perfectly, paving the way for more and more interesting meets.    Brittany and Alex came from different worlds, even though they inhabited in the same town. While Brittany's neighborhood was luxurious and full of people with class, Alex's life on the opposite wasn't any close - he had to share a room with two little annoying brothers, carried the responsibility of the family man and had to join Latino Blood so as to keep his loved ones safe. On the outside they looked nothing alike, but there was something they both shared - their true selves were always hidden. Brittany was not perfect and she was scared that fact would upset her mother and everyone around. As for Alex, witnessing his Dad's death left him in a prolonged grief and fear of losing someone he loved. The characters developed through certain circumstances, with their thoughts showing the deep side; conversations, on the other hand, showing the goofy, lovely or playful, scary side.    I loved Brittany and Alex's love. It came unexpectedly and naturally. It was attraction at first but then it grew into something stronger and more beautiful. They did not only have crushes on each other, but also shared understanding and real affection. The relationship encouraged Brit to do stuff she didn't dare to or just helped Alex get along with people he always thought he couldn't be with. I really really admired how Simone wrote their love making part. It was simply breathtaking and touching, making something stir inside me.    The ending was perfect. After everything they'd been through the couple finally had their happy ending, with realization of true love, friendship and what family really was. The epilogue cracked me up and I was really hoping there would be a story about little Paco and some poor (or lucky) girl.    If you love the kind \\"when two worlds collide, facade cracks and true love invades\\" of book, Perfect Chemistry won't disappoint you. And I have to add, best way to learn a little bit Spanish too
B00008PX8P|5.0|The 1970 performance on disc 1 is probably the best show on here.  They're practically kids!!  Plant is almost shy when he talks to the audience and is much less flamboyant or polished than just a few years later at Madison Square Garden and Earls Court.  Oh, but his powers are there. And dig the sideburns. They look like a garage band except that even at this early point in their career they're still so f***ing high-octane, they're more like a force of nature than anything born of a garage.  Their stage attire (if you can call it that) is just the kind of ordinary clothes you might wear to the park (no dragon zoSo pants or open shirts) on a fine London afternoon (in 1970).  But lurking beneath the plain exterior is the beast that was Led Zeppelin. It's incredible to watch.  Without the polish and confidance of a few years under their belt and covering only stuff from the first and second album they are STILL the meanest sounding garage band this and that side of the Atlantic. Filmed in London, this is VINTAGE Zeppelin before they were REALLY big.  For true Zepp fans, priceless.  Their look, sound and stage show here are noticably different from Song Remains the Same. 1970 is already a vintage-like-fine-wine year for most filmed rock n roll shows and rock music in general, but to see Zeppelin doing it that year is to witness a kind of \\"creme de la creme\\" in the fledgling world of heavy metal, with it's roots still deep in the previous few decades of folk and blues whilst giving new definition to the word 'rock n roll'.  Reviewers who don't appreciate this show either don't care for early 70s rock, or don't KNOW early 70s rock.  This stuff is the witches brew. This is the band a year after their first album, a year after Woodstock, and the same year Janis and Jimi died.  What a point in the history of music. The clarity of the sound and picture on this show make it a real treat for Zepp fans who get a chance to step back in time to see what they were doing whilst wewere in diapers, or roaming around in the ether.

Amazon does not have a return policy on the vendor. Took the disks to a local video store and paid them to resurface and fix the scratches.  They played OK but with hiccups. Had to live with it.

B002VECM6I|4.0|This empathetic 2009 sports-oriented drama is what professional critics would call an uplift film, unabashed in pulling all the necessary emotional cords with an undemanding audience. Screenwriter/director John Lee Hancock is no stranger to the genre since his last two films reflected similar against-all-odds storylines, the Texan band of brothers in [[ASIN:B0002DRDBY The Alamo]] and the over-the-hill pitcher in [[ASIN:B000068DBE The Rookie]]. However, there are two key factors that transcend the potentially manipulative structure of Hancock's adaptation of Michael Lewis' intriguing 2006 fact-based [[ASIN:0393330478 book]] about the evolution of the left tackle in pro football. The first is the irresistible pull of the true-life story of six-foot-six, 345-pound Michael Oher, plucked out of destitution in the Memphis projects by a well-to-do white family to become the starting left tackle at Ole Miss and now with the Baltimore Ravens. The second is Sandra Bullock, bleached blonde, immensely likable, and heavily into no-bull [[ASIN:B00003CXFV Erin Brockovich]] terrain, in a solid performance as Leigh Ann Touhy, the feisty decorator wife and mother who takes Oher into her family home.<br /><br />The film begins when the coach of a private religious school sees the otherwise lumbering Michael display natural athletic ability on the basketball court. The coach sees untapped potential in Michael as a football player because of his huge size, so much so that he gets accepted despite his poor academic record. It also turns out that the taciturn Michael, referred to by everyone as \\"Big Mike\\", is homeless, sleeping wherever he can since the state took him away as a child from his crack-addicted mother. The upscale Touhys have noticed him before since he goes to school with their children, S.J. and Collins, but it isn't until they see Michael wandering in the freezing cold that Leigh Anne impulsively takes him in. Despite some initial hesitation, he quickly becomes a part of the family, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field. Once Leigh Ann crystallizes the team-as-family metaphor for Michael, the 345-pound behemoth starts to realize his talent for smashing the defensive line. College football coaches from throughout the South come to the Touhy home to recruit Michael aggressively to play for them. Ole Miss is the Touhys' alma mater, which leads to an unexpected but inevitable dramatic turn.<br /><br />It's not that Bullock does anything all that new in the movie. Rather, it's that she leverages her winning, every-person screen persona so very well within a character that would seem antithetical to her sensibilities as an actress. While it's true that the story probably puts too much emphasis on her character's role in Michael's ascent, Bullock is one of the few film stars today that can generate such an instant rapport with her audience, and she carries the emotional weight of the story with grit and dexterity. As Michael, Quinton Aaron has to be such an impassive presence at the beginning that when he starts to form into his own person, the actor brings a gentle, palpable force to his character's evolution. It's really the scenes between Bullock and Aaron that tug most at the heartstrings (I welled up at least three times during those shrewdly engineered moments). On the sidelines, country singer Tim McGraw plays supportive husband Sean credibly, and there are scene-stealing turns from towheaded Jae Head as the indefatigable S.J. and Kathy Bates in her usual gutsy-broad form as Michael's tutor, Miss Sue. Broadway actress Adriane Lenox - who originated the role of Mrs. Miller in [[ASIN:B001PA0FFO Doubt]] - provides the film's most heartbreaking moments as Michael's haunted mother. This is far less a sports movie and more of a story of individual need and the power of family. The film is powerful in that respect.y, and his performance at school improves enough for him to show what he can do on the football field.

0786838655|5.0|This review as \\"ghost written\\" by my 12 year old son, Joshua.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief tells the story of seventh grader, Percy Jackson,  who discovers that he is a half-- son of the sea god, Poseidon, and a mortal.  Someone has stolen Zeus' lightning bolt, and Percy is asked  to find out who stole the lightning bolt and to return it.  Helping Percy in his quest is two friends, Annabeth the half-daughter of Athena and his satyr friend, Grover.  Along the way of the quest, Percy has many adventures, including going to the Underworld, meeting many mythical creatures that try to kill him and he meets a god who betrays him.<br /><br />I think this is a really good book because its full of adventure and surprises.  Its also kind of funny.  Its also a really good way to learn about Greek gods and myths.  I would definitely recommend this book to any ages.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|i got this book and loved it i started reading and protested everytime i had to put it down. i love how this is such a detailed book, what i meant by more than 1 way is that this doesnt just prepare you for a zombie apocalypse but prepares us for an apocalypse of any kind what if a nuclear war broke out you wouldnt want to be near civilization you would want to be somewhere remote as the book describes considering if the world didnt blow up from the nukes!!!
0312570740|5.0|\\"King of Oil\\" is really a series of interviews, questions and answers with Marc Rich. It mostly fills in the US Government's case against MR for both tax evaison and racketering. What the new revelations are are enough to make any American wonder what kind of perverse and twisted legal rationalizations for the charges against MR. Having read prior works about MR, mostly the USG's point of view, I can only believe that from the very beginning during J. Carter's presidency, MR was a marked man facts or no facts, constitutional rights or none. The book describes an ugly attempt to condemn and isolate an individual and trample his rights while also riding roughshod over Sovereign states. A true blackeye for the US.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|I can't beleive I'm going through another Beatles phase.  Abbey Road is great - even the cheesy songs.  The latest disc comes with a mini-documentary that launches when you put it in the PC.  Neat-o!
B002R4K6AG|1.0|This is an album designed for sentimental old fans, who buy it because \\"its Dylan\\". It is the worst Christmas music ever recorded, outdoing even Alvin and the Chipmunks. Poor Dylan goes from imitating Robert Johnson in a heavy blues voice, to trying to sing like Dean Martin.  I think his Frank Sinatra imitation is the most offensive, although the Perry Como is pretty bad.

B0020MKTOS|5.0|This certainly deserves it's R rating, the language is phenomenally horrendously obscene.  But that actually adds to the movie in my opinion.  I'm fully aware that it's not meant to be a comedy, but I laughed through the whole thing.  It's truly entertainment at its best!!
B0025KVLSI|5.0|I didn't hear this album until I was in my 20's and started buying British Imports. As another reviewer wrote, the songs on this album were distributed in America on Beatles '65 and Beatles VI and the songlists on those albums made more musical sense than the 14 songs on this album. By the same token, I think the American Rubber Soul is a stronger album and works better than the British version. Anyway, I love the opening of \\"I'm A Loser\\" with the echo on the strummed 12-string guitar, Paul's \\"I'll Follow The Sun\\", the chorus to \\"Baby's In Black\\" with its soaring 2-part harmony, the two tributes to Carl Perkins with Ringo's \\"Honey Don't\\" and George's \\"Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby\\". John's aching opening plea to \\"Mr. Moonlight\\". The American version, Beatles '65 also contained \\"I Feel Fine\\" and \\"She's A Woman\\", which I think were better choices than some of the other songs that made it onto Beatles For Sale. I wish Capitol would release the American albums in the remastered format as well.     Yes, the Beatles look tired on the cover of the album but it's still a classic photo by Robert Freeman. I don't think this is a weak album at all, even after following A Hard Day's Night. It's well-worth making it a part of your collection.   [[ASIN:B0025KVLSI Beatles For Sale (Remastered)]]
B002P8O29K|5.0|This Direct Cinema (Cinema Verite) documentary ultimately brings us to a Rolling Stones Concert, the final stop on a North American tour in 1969. There along with 300,000 mostly stoned flower children, a couple dozen mostly intoxicated Hell's Angels acting as security, Jefferson Airplane, The Flying Burrito Brothers, Ike and Tina Turner and of course the Rolling Stones, we witness chaos in the making.<br /><br />The documentary begins with New York concert footage and then takes us to a film editing room where Mick Jagger, along with the filmmakers are watching film clips of the Altamonte Concert playing on a flat bed editing machine. The footage shows events' unfolding at the time a man was killed. After being disarmed of a pistol, this man is stabbed and beaten to death by a group of Hell's Angels right in front of the stage. The murder is shot from the stage, as the Rolling Stones perform \\"Under My Thumb,\\" but it's difficult to tell exactly what's going on until the footage is viewed frame-by-frame. There were, in total, 4 deaths and 3 births at the concert that day.<br /><br />Early in the film we see scenes of the Rolling Stones performing at venues, including Madison Square Garden where relative calm prevails. But after watching the promoters arrange to bring the concert to the Altamonte Speedway, it soon becomes clear that disaster is looming. At the concert venue we see long lines of cars coming to the concert, people getting stoned, running naked and hanging out. The musicians performing before the Rolling Stones have difficulty keeping the stage clear and a Hell's Angel hits one musician.  When Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones start performing \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" it seems to transform the crowd into an unruly mob.<br /><br />Gimme Shelter does not have any interviews. Typical of a Direct Cinema documentary we are brought into the story as observers. In this case we are more then \\"flies on the wall.\\" It feels somehow that we too are in danger. This documentary is a fine example of the work of David Maysles, Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin.  Who are the same team that made other documentaries including Salesman in 1968.  Salesman takes us door-to-door with Bible Salesmen selling bibles. We sit in as they pitch prospective customers, go to sales meetings and the local diner. In both Direct Cinema documentary films; the filmmakers seem to be invisible.<br /><br />Gimme Shelter started out as a concert tour documentary but not a lot of pure performance scenes were used as more attention is paid to the upcoming concert in California. Events created a story no one anticipated, one that came together in the editing room. Still the scenes with Mick Jagger and the Rolling Stones performing are revealing of what the band was like in those days; perhaps the perfect gift for a Rolling Stones fan with a Blu-ray Player.<br /><br />This Blu-ray Disc release has excellent sound and has been totally restored and enhanced using the original 16mm color negative. It is well worth owning and viewing.<br /><br />J R Martinocumentary is a fine example of the work of David Maysles, Albert Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin.

B002X20W2E|1.0|I've been a Rihanna fan since she came out with her first single- \\"Pon De Replay\\" and I've enjoyed her music since. Her biggest success was \\"Good Girl Gone Bad,\\" and I very much enjoyed that album the most out of all of her cds. But alas to my dismay, I really didn't like it. I was expecting some of the same feel as of her old albums, but this album, I know she is singing from the bottom of her heart about the emotions she went through and the darkness in her personal life. But even this cd was just too much for my ears, I wanna say that this cd is just a dark phase of her life, like how Britney had \\"Blackout.\\" But who knows, I hope her next album appeals more to my liking because this just sunk out. Sorry to those who like the album, \\"to each their own.\\"
0887307280|5.0|This is a must-read book for anyone who wants to be a small business owner or is one and is frustrated by the lack of success they might be experiencing. Gerber lays out what the issues are for why business fail and also what business owners need to do to address those issues. Gerber's suggestions are practical and very useful. The concept of systematization for a business is ultimately a very useful idea and one more businesses need to implement. This book gets you started on learning how to do that.
B00129H7VS|5.0|This series is fantastic! I've watched it too many times to count. Truly painful, heartfelt, devastating...real. The first time my husband watched it I wasn't interested, figuring it'd be just another docu-drama about WWII. Boy was i wrong. I've experienced some serious emotional responses watching this and would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release will be nothing short of amazing...I hope.

0385504225|3.0|Another typical Dan Brown book, this time leading us on a 10 hour tour of Washington DC's monuments and their ancient symbology.  The capital comes to life as Brown describes in exquisite detail the nation's monuments and the artwork found within.  This aspect of the book is always what I have found most fascinating in his novel, and The Lost Symbol did not disappoint in this regard.  Langdon's long time friend and mentor, Peter Soloman, has summoned him to Washington to speak at a conference.  Much to Langdon's suprise, when he arrives he finds that a mysterious man has kidnapped Peter and was actually the one to invite him, but not to speak at a conference, but to solve an ancient mystery in exchange for Peter's life.    I was disappointed a little by Robert Langdon himself. I'm getting a bit tired of his character.  I enjoyed him in Angels and Demons and Da Vinci Code, but he has not grown thoughout these stories and he needs a little something extra added to his character if Brown intends to continue the series.    The journey through the capital is fast paced and draws you in, I had a hard time putting the book down when I needed to.  The cast of characters are wonderful, but the suprise twist is was a little too easy to figure out if you paid attention.  While I greatly enjoyed the story, the last 50 pages or so seemed more like an addition to the story after the fact.  They did not quite fit with the rest of the story and kind of ruined the ending for me.
B002HNA95E|5.0|I HIGHLY agree this should have either been a multi-disc boxset, OR there should have been a multi-media set for the hardcore fan, in addition to this 2CD set...<br /><br />In itself, this 2CD set is great!!!  Even tho over 50 key tracks are missing, what's included is actually topnotch, and the discs are crammed to the brim...no more songs can fit...the remastering is great (VERY happy about the original \\"Into The Groove\\" included), and the 2 discs have a nice flow...only a coupla mixes were jarring at first, like \\"Lucky Star\\", but they settle and sound fine where they are...the 2 new songs are great too...even with the great, I was still let down as I was expecting a multimedia boxset...and there was supposed to be one around the time of \\"American Life\\", but it got delayed and then cancelled, but I'm still holding out for hope of one happening.<br /><br />I agree with M. Immel, Madge deserves a set like that, with a complete set of all her singles (original 7\\"s, all international releases, all 12\\"s), unreleased tracks, rare B-sides like \\"Ain't No Big Deal\\", odds & ends like all her songs from soundtracks like \\"I'll Remember\\", the 4 songs from \\"Who's That Girl\\", the 2 from \\"Next Best Thing\\", etc, the rare track from the \\"Just Say Roe\\" compilation, the online exclusive \\"I'm So Cool\\", etc.<br /><br />There should be the complete video collection on DVD and Blu-Ray...all the songs on the Blu-Ray disc as well, like on the multi-disc Tom Petty live box from BestBuy...consisting of ALL videos, not just the 47 clips on the 2DVD regular set, but the missing ones too, like \\"American Life\\", \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Fever\\", etc, her movies perhaps, docs on all tours, a doc on the \\"Sex\\" book...include a velvet hardcover book of essays, all lyrics and rare photos (complete with ribbon bookmark)...package it in a blue velvet box, and have it be numbered, a certificate of authenticity and signed note by Madonna herself??<br /><br />People would buy this thing...oh yes they would...like in \\"Field Of Dreams\\", if they build/make it, they will come...that MJ box was decent but far from perfect...Madge's should be better...and even tho she's no longer with Warners, they can STILL make the box, and have it out in time for when her Live Nation debut drops...Warners probably owns the rights to her catalogue...unless she does, and they should work together on it, in cohoots with her fans and manager, Guy Oseary...it's not too late...they rushed out \\"Celebration\\" for the holiday season, now they can take the time and assemble a proper classy set...<br /><br />It should be 6-8 CDs, 3-4 DVDs, a Blu-Ray, a version with vinyl perhaps, the hardcover book, art prints...<br /><br />Something like this would retail around $200, and should be sold either online only, or at BestBuy stores only, and they should be numbered, like 10,000 copies...<br /><br />They would sell, no doubt...it's not too late...it might get done, mark my words, I'D buy it!!make it, they will come...that MJ box was decent but far from perfect...Madge's should be better...and even tho she's no longer with Warners, they can STILL make the box, and have it out in time for when her Live Nation debut drops...Warners probably owns the rights to her catalogue...unless she does, and they should work together on it, in cohoots with her fans and manager, Guy Oseary...it's not too late...they rushed out \\"Celebration\\" for the holiday season, now they can take the time and assemble a proper classy set...

B001AVCFK6|4.0|Talk about taking the hard way. Director JJ Abrams could have done a million things for a Star Trek film. He could have continued the \\"Next Generation\\" films- plenty to milk there-. He could have started a brand new film franchise from the plethora of other quality spin-offs available like Deep Space Nine, Voyager or Enterprise. Instead he went to the source: The original series, and virtually re-created the franchise from the ground up. Not only was this ambitious but to some virtually impossible. Fans prepared for the worst. This is not some run-of-the-mill show. This is Star Trek! How do you change what millions on trekkies(trekkers?) and more casual (read:less obsessed) fans have come to know and love for decades now? Well, the answer is 2009's Star Trek. A film that manages to please not only the faithful but also draws in the rest of the movie-going audience as well. This little gem of a film has now made it to our homes in the form of a gem of a Blu-Ray package.<br /><br />First the film itself:<br /><br />As I asked in my statement above: How do you please the millions of fans of this franchise? On a re-make of all things?! Well, the answer seems to be: Go for extreme \\"geekness\\". (I use the word with respect. After all I consider myself one) Unlike other re-makes that completely ignore previous entries and start from zero(Batman Begins comes to mind), Star Trek goes around this problem by using time travel -a very common plot device used in the series- to basically maintain the legacy of the original series while creating a brand new beggining for the current crew. Yes, its still Kirk and Spock and the gang but its an \\"alternate\\" reality. Completely seperate from the original canon. I don't want to go into details and spoil it but it boils down to this: Those who want to give over-think the issue (as many sci-fi fans do) will have the oportunity to do so while for the casual fan, it will simply be a little detail that won't interfere with the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />And speaking of the casual movie fan, they are in for a treat. Star Trek is a great film. It is well written and acted. The pacing is just right in my opinion and manages to introduce all the characters without feeling like they rushed it. Like in the original series, the relationship between Kirk and Spock is front and center but somehow it feels fresh. A lot of that has to do with Zachary Quinto and Chris Pine giving a much needed edge to what we already know and love. In fact all the actors here seem to bring something new while paying homage to the actors that played the roles before them. Two exceptions though: Karl Urban seemed to have been posessed by the ghost of DeForest Kelley. His portrayal of \\"Bones\\" McCoy is downright creepy in how Urban got every single twitch and mannerism right. Also, I found the guy playing Chekov annoying but it might just be me as I also didn't care for the actor in Terminator: Salvation.<br /><br />This is a great film that appeals to both the fans and those looking for a good movie to watch. While the film is filled details and moments that the faithful will go nuts over, you don't have to know squat about Star Trek to simply sit down and enjoy the film. Certainly one of the top films of 2009.<br /><br />Now for the Blu-Ray transfer:<br /><br />It's fitting that this is one the top films 2009 because quite simply this is one of the best Blu-Ray releases of 2009 as well. Paramount not only delivered an amazing transfer of the film but put in a worthy package with great extras and the quickly-becoming-the-norm digital copy for good measure.<br /><br />The transfer is nearly flawless. The future certainly looks bright in HD. The set design of the film is clinically pristine. Everything looks new and shiny. You seem to be able to eat from any surface. This has carried over well to HD, where the whitest of white bridge of the USS Enterprise clashes with the intense primary colors of the uniforms worn by the crew. Speaking of which, the textures in the fabrics of said uniforms-basically the differing addition to the classic uniforms- is clearly visible. It's that level of visible detail that you can expect throughout the film. Thanks to this fact I can honestly say I enjoyed the film more watching it the second time in my home than the first time in the movie theater. The visuals in this film simply come to life in this Blu-Ray. My favorite scene is the Enterprise rising out of an inky-red mist. Without a doubt my favorite \\"wow\\" moment.<br /><br />The extras go deep into the creation of the film and covers the entire second disc of this release. Here fans can explore to their heart's content what went into the film and what didn't but most importantly the why's. Every decision has a reason behind it and this is where the extra content really shines in my opinion.<br /><br />This realease is really a triple threat: A film that will appeal to fans, non-fans AND HD aficionados alike. I highly recommend it.niforms-basically the differing addition to the classic uniforms- is clearly visible. It's that level of visible detail that you can expect throughout the film.

0316017922|4.0|As many people at work were raving about this book I needed to read it for myself.  I was a little reluctant at first because of some of the Amazon reviews saying that Gladwell culled information from a lot of studies and that the reader would be better served going to some of those studies themsleves.    Gladwell has done an excellent job of poring through mountains of data and presented many of these studies in a concise way that can be understood by any layman.  Most of the information is presented in a logical and interesting progression.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it in the same way when I am flipping channels and I see something marvelous structure being built on a Discovery Channel show.    Though the information is fascinating and I enjoyed reading most of the book, I wonder if this is really a \\"self-help\\" book or not.  The first few chapters talk about how successful people are made.  Having not been born in the first three months of the year, I already missed the first level of success.  Not having 10,000 hours available to master something new, I missed the next idea.  I was not born in the ideal years for success in the computer field (1952-1955) and my parents were not clothing makers in Eastern Europe.     I was not born Asian so I will never have the mastery of math that someone that speaks and Asian language has from the time they started first learning numbers.  Then the chapter on the likelihood of a crash based on ethnic background makes one be more frightened to fly on one of the airlines that may have a pilot and copilot from a \\"class-laden\\" country.  I assume that the studies and new training methods have since reduced these risks.    What it all comes down to is that this is a fun read and I definately recommend the book because the reader will find most of it fascinating.  But there is very little information that can be used for those that want a \\"self-help\\" manual to be successful.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|And that problem is Arista overlord Clive Davis. Ms. Houston SHOULD have let Davis sit this one out so she could make an edgier, more honest record out of her well-publicized troubles, but instead she plays it safe, belting out cliche after cliche and adhering to the standard Davis playbook every step of the way. Still, \\"Million Dollar Bill,\\" \\"Nothin' But Love,\\" and the bitchy closer, \\"Salute,\\" have just enough spice to justify a purchase.
0765360969|4.0|A really unique concept underlies these novels. I found the alchemical powers here refreshing in the same way that Steven Erikson's use of tapping into Warrens was... none of that abracadabra mumbo jumbo. Groundbreaking concepts aside, the characters and events bring a ton of clarity to this storyline. The 'Fledgling God' innuendos will have me thinking back on these books for a long time.
B00154GEFU|2.0|I can't say for sure why I decided to review this CD.  It is in hind-site a very insignificant release.  The nostalgia factor was high since they came into being as my puberty was taking hold.  I certainly enjoyed the 1st 3 albums (Astra to a lesser degree) so I figured I might as well complete the collection (not including the non-Wetton years which I found dreadful).    This is NOT a masterpiece, not wonderful, not mind-blowing, not a classic as some of the reviews I have read stated.  It's not even a matter of opinion really.    This sounds like men well past middle-age trying to cash in on something its middle-aged fan base has been clambering for decades to bring into being.    It's not terrible; it's simply fantastically average and at times down right boring.  A couple of songs were entertaining as they contained the signature multi-layered over the top melodic chorus Asia was famous for.  I simply can't sit by and listen to people call this CD a genius work of art without knowing where I can get me some of what they are smoking.  Genius 5 star albums are very few and far between (Moving Pictures, Lamb Lies Down, The Wall - you see where I'm going).  let's not throw around terms we don't know how to use because we once loved something that has come back to us a bit decrepit and past it's prime.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|If you like video games and CGI's this movie is a 10. However if you are greedy enough to want more from script and direction then altered personalities, biker style Romulans with dialogue to match, and key players who look and sound like your local high school troupe, you may find this wanting.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Christmas songs are so second-nature that listening can become a stream of conscious activity where the words, let alone the meaning, get buried in the holiday feeling. Dylan fans and true listeners won't get off that easy here. Dylan takes us on a dreamy trip to a past fictionalized America that is buried deep within each of us. It's a Christmastime America that only childhood memories can create. While we're there, the lyrics and the meaning of these Christmas classics come through again for the first time, magically recreating the familiarity of childhood in the complexity of our grown-up selves. In this place we're given another chance to recreate our stories, to start again. It's the Christmas story in its essence.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Please note that I saw this movie on HBO so I can't comment on the video quality.<br /><br />Gran Torino is perhaps both Eastwood's best movie and his best acting performance yet. He plays a crusty, grumpy, hardened Korean War veteran who doesn't take you know what from anybody. He brings a brooding, smoldering intensity to the character of a retired, working-class white man who doesn't like how his neighborhood has been taken over by various minorities and gangs over the years, becoming crime ridden and the homes falling into disrepair. In fact, he seems to be the only white guy left. But despite his racist feelings, he dislikes bullies and senseless violence even more, and when he comes to the aid of the neighboring Hmong boy when he's victimized by the local Asian gang, he unwittingly and unwillingly becomes a hero to the boy and his family.<br /><br />Eastwood strikes up an awkward friendship with the boy, and teaches him the old fashioned values he grew up with: hard work, self-reliance, independence, discipline, and integrity, values that he sees very little in evidence in his now fallen neighborhood. The scene where he teaches the boy \\"to talk like a man\\" is one of the funniest scenes I've seen in any movie, so despite the overall serious tone of the movie, it's not without its humorous moments too. Overall, it's a remarkable performance and movie from Eastwood and a fitting cap to a great career. Even if he retires after this he will have gone out at the top of his game. Not many people who are still working at age 78 can say that.
B0025KVLT2|3.0|I bought this, then was dismayed to read that it had \\"been enhanced to play on computer\\".  In that sense, it is probably truth in advertising.  It is compressed, loud and emphasizes midrange.  This is perfect for the awful excuses for speakers that most people have connected to their computers - screechy little boxes and tuneless thumping powered bass. Much of the beauty of music is in midrange and dynamics, both of which take money and space to reproduce.  I have just played the old CD, new CD and vinyl.  If you have a real stereo at home, play the vinyl at home, play the new CD in your car and iPod, make the old CD a drink coaster.
B000001F95|3.0|I suppose if there is such a thing as an Irish day spa, this is what they are probably playing. Beyond that application, I can see no use for this music. Relaxing, maybe. Tedious, definitely.
B002GZQY6Q|4.0|I avoided reviewing this one immediately in order to allow myself time to digest the thing properly.  With some bands (PT being a prime example), my opinion may sway from side to side as the days go by and I have listened through all my various mood swings.  I also wanted to know if this would age well.  Occasionally, I can listen to something 10 - 20 times and get all I can out of it and rarely feel the desire to resurrect it.  This is usually not the case with Porcupine Tree.   Until the Incident.       This one befuddled me at first as it seems a bit disjointed upon the first few listens.  After one becomes used to it's flow it has a charm that allows you to sing with it and enjoy what it's trying to accomplish.  After you have learned all the melodies and sequences, it pretty much has served its purpose.    I rarely have the urge to revisit it accept for my guilt factor which tells me I love everything this band does.  I can't put a finger on any one thing but there it is.  It's good, it's not great.  Great is In absentia; which I think we all (or most folks I know) would agree is this bands watershed moment.  I never wanted Wilson to try to recreate that album and he certainly has not.  Deadwing is almost if not as good.  FOABP got rather heavy and angry (fine) but was far more 1 dimensional than earlier work.     Maybe I don't know what the hell I'm talking about but this is how I view this CD after 3 months to absorb.  The live presentation I saw in Baltimore was excellent!    I give the damn thing 4 stars since it's still quite a bit better than what I'm hearing lately....And I support the HELL out if this band.  Nickleback anyone??  I think not.
0385504225|3.0|I wanted The Lost Symbol to have the same 'couldn't put it down, stayed up till 4 am to finish' quality Angels and Demons, Da Vinci Code and Deception Point had.  Alas, it took way too long to get into the story and it went on well past the point it should have ended. It was easy to figure out the real identity of the villain and having done so, his motive and actions just weren't credible.<br />The Lost Symbol would have benefited from a good edit.  I think it would have been a much better read at 350 pages.  At 500+, the suspense was diffused, and it was easy to find flaws.  It seemed to me that the characters were flat and the action scenes padded to draw them out.<br /><br />My major complaint was the lack of character development.  Perhaps if we knew what events had shaped Sato, Katherine and Katherine, or if we knew exactly why Mal'khi turned out the way he did (the reason given wasn't enough), it would have been more convincing.  As it was, the reader wasn't invested enough in the characters to make for compelling page turning. The bad guys who turn out to be good guys or is it the other way around? who are Mr. Brown's specialty weren't very interesting.  Other flaws include a tattooed villain weirdly reminiscent of a Thomas Harris character without enough at stake to justify the story, some not very interesting tangential story lines and the earthshaking threat was 'meh, so what?' and what could have been a riveting late night chase through DC was sidetracked too many times and in too many ways by too many bumblers.<br /><br />There were some good elements.  The research into Noetics was interesting, if tangential (I kept hoping Katherine would save everybody with a little practical Noetics), there were some nice scenes inside national landmarks (though how weird is it that Robert Langdon would fall asleep on the catwalk under the Capitol Dome), and Mr. Brown's trademark gimmick of turning the familiar on its ear was there, if dimmer than hoped for.  The nice elements seemed to be buried in filler, though.<br /><br />The Lost Symbol will be interesting for Freemasons, if only to check Mr. Brown's facts and I don't doubt it will make a great movie.  The right script will tighten up the story, and good actors will create convincing characters.  It just didn't make a very good novel.  I apologize.to be buried in filler, though.

B002M3GPOI|5.0|Before I bought this I debated as to whether it was worth it. After all, I've been a fan of this album for many years. I am simply glad to have gotten it. I won't give you song listings as another reviewer has already done this. I will just tell you to get it while you can. Evidently it is limited. There are a lot of tasty morsels to go along with the regular album and if I had one complaint to give it would be that the live bootleg cd had been left off. The sound is horrible. I'm sure they did what they could with it, but the tape must have been stretched to the limit. Other than that I am certainly pleased enough to give it 5 stars.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|It was great to get every possible format for 19.99. A regular DVD, a digital copy for my iTunes account, and the Blu-ray disc. The movie is tremendous, my wife and I love watching this movie over and over.
067144901X|5.0|This is a must have for your little one's collection.  My daughters both loved it.  Perfect from baby age to around age 3.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|You will be crying within the first 5 minutes of the movie.  I even saw men crying in the theater! It is a great story, well written, and has the funny little Disney quirks throughout the movie as well.  I will be buying this as a gift for several friends and family this year.  I have no doubts that they will love it as much as I do!
B001QOGY9K|5.0|Disney's taken the old fairy tale and given it a new spin.  This time, the story takes place in 1920's New Orleans at the height of the Jazz Age. The heroine is a little African American girl, Tiana (voiced by Anika Noni Rose).     Tiana's the daughter of New Orlean's best seamstress, but she actually wants to follow in her father's footsteps.  Her loving Dad (Terrence Howard) is the best cook on the bayou and he dreams of opening up a fancy restaurant where people of all walks of life will come and enjoy his good food.     Her unlikely friend, Charlotte or Lottie (Jennifer Cody) is the daughter of the wealthiest white man in New Orleans.  She dreams of marrying a Princess.  The girls were first exposed to the classic Princess and the Frog story quite young.  Charlotte's very willing to kiss a frog to get her Prince.  While Tiana does wish on a star, she believes like her father that hard work's the only way to get ahead in this life.      Even after her father's death, Tiana continues to work two jobs saving every penny to get her dream.  The last few dollars to put the downpayment on her dream restaurant come into her hands when word comes that Prince Naveen (Bruno Campos) has come to town seeking a bride.  Charlotte's having a Mardi Gras party that night and she needs a whole lot of beignets to win that man's heart.      But, the Shadow Man has other plans for the Prince.  Dr. Facilier (Keith David) puts a spell on Naveen exchanging him for his manservant.  The prince, who turns out to be a pauper looking for a wealthy woman to marry, is now a frog.      When Naveen sees Tiana clad as a princess, he believes that she's the answer.  All he needs is one kiss, but that kiss turns Tiana green and slimy as well.  The mismatched pair are off on an adventure in the bayou that is going to include characters as diverse as horn playing frogs and philosophical fireflies before the tale is told. Oprah Winfrey makes a brief, but very memorable, appearance as a swamp witch,  Mama Odie.      This Disney children's tale was spot on with the telling.  While we had an evil voodoo villain, Dr. Facilier didn't scare even the youngest kids in the audience because he was done in more of a comic fashion. Randy Newman's jazzy soundtrack was excellent, too.  This is one children's film soundtrack that I suspect many parents will enjoy as well.  I'm definitely buying the soundtrack myself!

0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown keeps his readers turning the page, but much slower in \\"Lost Symbol.\\" Brown's ideas are great, but re-using the same formula of the \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" and \\"Angels and Demons,\\" causes a little bit of disappointment. Brown provides many interesting facts in his books, because he does wonderful research. Brown provides the reader with race-against-time thrillers, which are well thought out, but not brilliantly written.
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Great to see a re-release with new songs and lyrics included and the dvd material is fantastic. It was worth buying the album again.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|Before you buy the movie tickets and order your popcorn, be sure to take about five minutes or so and brush up on the game of rugby. Then head for the theatre door, grab a seat and watch Morgan Freeman portray South Africa president Nelson Mandela in Clint Eastwood's latest gem,Invictus. In 1995, Mandela used the sport of rugby to bring a nation together, and now, Freeman, in 2009, uses his talent as an actor to show the world on the silver screen how one man's courage and fortitude brought together a nation of 43 million. As for a quick-reference guide on rugby, it is football without pads and it is rough. Forty-minute halves and no timeouts. No forward passing...and if you have a kicker who can boot the ball a long way,that will help. Field goals are worth three points, extra points are two, and if you can battle your way across the goal line it is worth five points. There you go. Of course, there's a few more rules (but not many), but that's enough to make you a little more knowledgeable than the fella next to you who just asked his friend next to him,\\"What is the score?\\"
0312360258|2.0|I was looking for another new series in the same genre as Sookie Stackhouse and Twilight... luckily, I was able to snag a copy of this initial book from the House of Night series at the library.    Geez... have to say, from someone who usually has no qualms about reading youth fiction series -- this book was very disappointing. It seemed to be very much geared towards a junior high audience. The vampire ideas are interesting, but after finishing it I just ultimately don't care about the characters. And as for the vocabulary, I think another reviewer mentioned their surprise at the reference to 'turd' -- well, I'm pretty sure 'boobie' made a rather frequent appearance as well, followed by the lead character giggling about it each time...
B00000373U|5.0|Probably his greatest album, the songwriting here is fantastic.  For guitar: listen to \\"Angeles\\" for guitar picking on par with Dylan's \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\"; \\"Cupid's Trick\\" for distorted rocking; \\"Rose Parade\\" and \\"Alameda\\" for melodic guitar lines; and \\"Between the Bars\\" for bare bones simplicity.  Harmonies here are on par with The Beatles, and there is a sense of intimacy as if the songs are sung for you alone.  The lyrics are aching, bleak sometimes, yet drive past the pain at points like with the optimism of \\"Say Yes\\".      If you like harmonies this is a must own.  If you like simple arrangements, this is a must own.  If you like honest emotions and great lyrics, you need to get this album.  Other than \\"Cupid's Trick\\" every song sounds very similar; but in those similar songs are a range of emotions, all completely real.  That's why this a classic, because all the songs are fantastic and you could listen to them all day long.  If you haven't heard the album before, you should right away.
B002JCSWUW|4.0|The story of 'Invictus' centers around newly elected South African president Nelson Mandela's attempt to move his people past the apartheid that has plagued his country for so long. An attending of a rugby match, and watching the fans reaction -- divided down racial lines -- to their home country's team, inspires Mandela to contact Francois Pienaar, captain of the South African Springboks rugby team, to see if sport can be used to bring the people together.<br /><br />One concern I had about the success of this film in the U.S. is that it centers around rugby, a sport which has never been embraced by Americans. I wondered if people would be able to identify with it, but the movie is filmed in such a way that prior knowledge of the sport of rugby (of which I have absolutely NONE) is unnecessary. There are stand-up-and-cheer moments in the film, but it's difficult to label this movie as a sports film. It's much more than that. There is a lot of standard sports movie fare within this film, but I wouldn't call it cliche in any way.<br /><br />This film is a probable Oscar contender for Best Picture, but Morgan Freeman's nomination for Best Actor, I would label as a certainty. Matt Damon, as South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar was quite possibly the best I've ever seen him. The South African soundtrack added some great flavor to the film.<br /><br />At the risk of sounding corny, it's been a while since I saw a film that I found inspiring. I would not call this film director Clint Eastwood's best work, but I absolutely found inspiration in 'Invictus'.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|since I received this.  Very rarely do I like an album completely but this CD is the exception that proves the rule and quite frankly, a CD like this should be 'the rule'.  Lady GaGa really opens up to her fans and critics with this one.  Leaving herself vulnerable yet strong.. she will not be denied nor made to lead.  I love 'Bad Romance and then I heard the rest of the tracks. It seems like this was just one hit after another! 'Teeth' is my very favourite track. So primal, raw and full of sexuality.  'Speechless' brings me to tears, just beautiful to listen to.  I could go on but I just really want to say \\"Buy this CD and open yourself up to a whole new world- the delicious world of Lady GaGa!\\"    And just for those that are wondering - I am only a fan.  A huge fan that has found music very boring until I heard Lady GaGa's music.      *yes, it's censored a little bit but it doesn't take away from the her songs at all.*
B001QOGYB8|3.0|This movie gets under way with everything going for it. Star-powered voicing features George Clooney. Merryl Streep's lovely low tones, Owen Wilson, Bill Murray, and more. Stop animation has made huge strides even in the age of CGI, and can provide some of the most innovative and engaging imagery around. Basing a movie on a Roald Dahl book certainly won't hurt it, either - look what Dahl parentage did for 'James and the Giant Peach', the various Willie Wonkas, and lots of others.<br /><br />So, with all this going for it, the movie just didn't thrill me, and I'm not sure why. The animation, though thoroughly competent, rarely rose above competence - but did so nicely in the \\"digging\\" scenes and in any involving smoke. Characters grated on me, especially Mr. Fox himself, who I found irredeemably self-centered, the kind who tends to reward friends' loyalty with some pretty poor behavior. Also, I'll happily go along with a forestful of critters in educated professions and snappy tailoring. Within that context (and within his sharp-looking leisure suit), Fox's claim to being a wild animal rings false - unless \\"wild\\" means something more like a frat party than like a jungle.<br /><br />So, I kept the characters at arm's length, and the artistry wasn't enough to pull me in. I'm glad I saw it, but I'm in no rush to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release

B001EO2UJK|2.0|I'm not going to ramble on about compression or tell you to \\"google loudness war\\" or tell you about opening up these files in a wave editor.  This is just my impression from listening to these remixes.<br /><br />These remixes are interesting in that you can hear all kinds of new things with some clearer separation, but for the most part in the attempt to make each instrument track sound more distinct the overall sound has lost a lot of the unity/warmth that the original mixes had.  The drums are way out in front now, and as a consequence you can hear the room they are recorded in.  It's interesting to listen to the isolated drum track so loudly placed in the mix, but you also hear how clearly it was recorded separate from the rest of the instruments.  It ends up taking away from the cohesive sound that the originals had.<br /><br />And then there's the fact that not all of the original studio effects were reproduced.  In some cases the engineer opted to use a simpler or different effect in place of the original.  This is especially true throughout The Lamb.  I found myself missing the original effects, even if they were considered flawed by current standards.<br /><br />The video content is great, I really enjoyed the documentaries.  The remixes are interesting but I don't agree with the way they have pulled the original mixes off the shelves and are now only selling these.

0156027321|3.0|Yann Martel anticipated readers like me. He wrote, in Chapter 22, \\"Whereas the agnostic, if he stays true to his reasonable self ... to the very end, lack[s] imagination and miss[es] the better story.\\" That is where he was wrong. Just as an evolution biologist can better admire the intricate beauty and infinite possibilities (as well as statistical improbabilities) of the universe than a Bible-thumping creationist zealot, an agnostic can better appreciate the duality of humanism vs. supernaturalism.    Martel's treatment of the ending made light of the Japanese officials' interrogation of Pi and made the officials incompetent and irrelevant laughingstock. In spite of the otherwise well written novel (albeit having an excruciatingly slow Part One), I found myself thoroughly disappointed in Martel's reluctance to let alone the reader's imagination of what truly happened at sea.    Oh, don't even get me started on the reading group guide. If I were a lawyer, I would accuse this guide of leading the witness!
B00009ZYBY|1.0|[I wrote this review some years ago under an anonymous account. I'm resubmitting it so that it will show up under My Reviews, as it sums up what I think about a lot of modern movie-making.]    I strongly believe that the tremendous success of this movie at the box office and the awards is tragic testimony to how the art of film-making has declined from storytelling to mere sensory stimulation. Consider: music that never lets up; reverb added to every voice, even when characters are talking out in the open; constant use of quick camera cuts to ensure that you never have a chance to study or reflect on anything; every scene keyed to the same pitch of intensity, so that there is little to distinguish a fight in a small provincial amphitheatre from the climax in the Colosseum. It's all just a barrage of noise and light calculated to keep your reptile brain stimulated while your intellect shuts down.     Compare this film to [[ASIN:B00005A8TY Spartacus]], a movie that could not be made in this era because the younger generation, overstimulated by movies like Gladiator, would consider it boring. Despite the lack of computer FX, the action scenes in the earlier movie are so much more successful because (a) they stand out against the background of long, slow, quiet plot and character development and (b) they are coherent, unlike the muddled battles and fights of Gladiator, where you don't get much of an idea of what is going on besides general mayhem.    It's really sad that manipulation of the senses has become so confused with artistry. Sad because more movies like this will be made, while we get to see fewer and fewer that offer any stimulation for the higher parts of the brain.

B002SJIO54|4.0|The best way to view this film is without knowing anything about it. Truly, it is best going into this completely blind. If you love watching something with an original spin on things, I really think this film has what you want. I mean, how often is it that you see a film where the aliens are the ones kept underneath the humans, treated like the lowest of the low, basically forced to live in their own filth? And that is just the setup to this really cool film. The actors are complete unknowns- and do a fantastic job, especially the lead. The movie itself, filmed quite inexpensively compared to just about anything nowadays, is filled with ridiculously awesome and realistic effects that makes Transformers 2 look like a video game.     The reason I fell in love with District 9 is because this particular brand of Sci-Fi isn't just about effects and aliens and coverups. It actually has a plot, and a heart, so to speak. The humans you learn to despise and the aliens you completlely sympathize with. It's not a common occurance. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, so I will just say that the reason I did not give this film 5 stars is because of how it ended. I wasn't dissatisfied, per se, but I thought it a tad predictable, and is clearly screaming for a sequel. Either way though, District 9 is a great film, and certainly one of the better ones from 2009.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|Here's a challenge for you:  Try to watch this animated short film just once.  Just try to resist the temptation you'll feel to go back to the beginning and start this amazing film all over again.    You won't be able to do resist; that much I can promise you.    This is by far one of the most amazing short films I have ever seen.  This is film about a mutual exploration; the child-protaganist builds The Snowman, and then through magic, this Snowman comes to life.  The child invites the Snowman indoors, where the child shows the Snowman the inside of the house.  The Snowman explores the child's world, showing the audience how things so familiar to us become things of oddity and wonder to the Snowman.    Then, in turn, the Snowman invites the child to explore the Snowman's world.  It is at this point of the film that we are taken on a flying journey into the magical world of the snowman, a world that observes our own, but is still apart from our own.    Be prepared for the ending of this film:  It is NOT what you would expect at all.  It says something about what we lose when we cease to be children, and become adults.    It is impossible not to be deeply emotionally effected by this amazing short movie.  I recommend it unreservedly.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|This album is outstanding.  It ain't your mama's hip-hop.  Kid Cudi's style is very dreamy and trance-like.  I can't wait for more from this guy.
B0000046JP|5.0|Chances are if you are reading this review you have already made up your mind on buying the album, i will keep this review short. I agree with all the previous 5 star review but i will add only one thing which no one has mentioned yet, did you know Paco de Lucia couldn't read the music notes? An article stated, \\"De Luc&iacute;a claimed in Paco de Lucia-Light and Shade: A Portrait, that he gave greater emphasis to rhythmical accuracy in his interpretation of the Concierto at the expense of the perfect tone preferred by classical guitarists. Joaqu&iacute;n Rodrigo later declared that no one had ever played his composition in such a brilliant manner.\\"<br /><br />I rest my case. Feast your ears on sheer genius of de lucia and rodrigo.
1416955070|4.0|In the first book, it took me a long time to get into it mostly because i was not thrilled with the style of writing- it was long and detailed, but towards the end there was enough of a cliffhanger to make me want the second book. By the time i got to the third book, i was completely in love with the series, they capture everything in my mind and it wanted me to read more. as a high school student, i dont have all the time in the world but i would highly suggest this book to every student. It was hard not to fall in love with the hard, but sensitive male characters. Great read, but it may take some time to get into
B001OQCV24|1.0|Here we are again. Over hyped Hollywood garbage filled with special effects trying to bank on irrational fears of the masses. I guess I would compare this movie to: \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and \\"Paranormal Activity.\\" What do all of these movies have in common? A crazy internet marketing scheme designed to fool people into believing the events are real and inspiring a more moving theatre going experience. This is ok for the two movies I mentioned because they just stole your money and your time....except for Paranormal Activity which was actually pretty good. However, in the case of \\"2012,\\" they're adding fuel to the fire of irrational ignorant masses. There were actually reports of suicides and other crimes due to people's fears of the 2012 events; many of them as a direct result of the propaganda associated with this film. I'm really sick of all the lies about global warming and other dooms day predictions pouring into the \\"real\\" news and the heads of gullible people. Thanks to the hype of this movie, I had to hear about 3 idiots a week try to explain to me the inevitable doom that would come in 2012. Not to mention that it reinforces the pathetic claims of various religious groups and allows them to continue their unwarranted solicitation at my house.<br /><br />I can't believe that Cusack signed on for this movie; he must really be getting desperate for funds. I found his performance to be the only salvageable part of the movie, but not enough for me to get passed the masquerade of half wits trying to act and special effects taking the place of a good plot. Oh wow, we're outrunning an earthquake...ehhh.<br /><br />If you like pointless action movies with a ton of special effects, then maybe you can enjoy this movie, but I for one am sick of Hollywood passing of garbage with irresponsible advertising campaigns.<br /><br />No more please
0312360266|4.0|This is the first book in a very captivating series of books. The main charter has many of the trials and tribulations of your average teenage in a not so average world. She is witty and clever. She at times reminds me of Harry Potter in the way she thinks. I would recommend this book to anyone in the early high school years and up. I read them at the age of 26. so it's never to late.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Juli's husband says it in the movie and he's right - she sure is narcissistic and then some.  I sensed before seeing the film, remembering the title of the book too - Julie and Julia - that it was going to be about her, Julie, with a \\"dollop\\" of Julia who should have been the main focus of the movie [i.e. Julia and Julie].  If you want to watch a self-involved person blog about herself and then watch her be surprised that Julia Child might not be happy with the \\"poaching\\" of her life and territory for Julie's own aggrandizement, well, then, enjoy the movie!!!  I notice in the picture on the front of the DVD, Julie is represented with her finger in her mouth, looking like she's saying \\"oops!'  Yeah, the film is an \\"oops!.\\"
B002361MLA|5.0|This is pure Eckhart Tolle, into the deep end. If you are religious this will strengthen your faith.  If you are not religious, you will appreciate his keen observations on life and humanity, maybe not too different to yours, but given relevance and urgency by this classic work of cutting edge spirituality. This  book was his first; and his second book, \\"A New Earth\\", is a fuller expounding  of his teaching. Both have been Amazon best sellers, and both are available on Amazon kindle. Eckhart Tolle says that \\"the now is all that exists\\". Think about it. See his interviews on YouTube. Is this the answer to your searching? It was for me, and many others, world wide.
B00288KNL8|4.0|I picked this up because I loved the style of it, and I thought it looked along the lines of The Nightmare Before Christmas.  While its nowhere as good as that one, it's still pretty good.  The alternate world is especially interesting, and I enjoyed the story as well.  It was a little scary for my toddler but me and my son both liked it.

Sólo una pequeña y discreta anotación aparece en éste para facilitar la búsqueda. Las versiones van de lo bueno a lo excelente. No podia ser de otra forma tratándose de esta magnífica pianista. Una compra estupenda.

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Portishead - Third (2008)<br /><br />A brilliant return after such a long wait. Portishead changes the game plan on THIRD, largely abandoning the trip-hop formula they helped pioneer. I completely understand those who call this music \\"prog\\" because it's very sophisticated and goes on mind-bending tangents. I prefer not to label it. This is a pretty unique piece of music and a striking reinvention. By far the most depressing thing they've put out yet. A tour de force.<br /><br />\\"Silence\\" - launches out across unknown territory like a train running off the tracks into a barren land, tumbling headlong into Beth Gibbons' nightmare-ish world spinning out of control. *****<br /><br />\\"Hunter\\" - This one's a sweet and hazy dream. And like dreams, it morphs in strange ways, burrowing through tunnels and going to disturbing places. *****+<br /><br />\\"Nylon Smile\\" - Gibbons is worrying her heart out on this hypnotic, unsettling trip through emotional wreckage. *****+<br /><br />\\"The Rip\\" - A supremely beautiful song - \\"Wild white horses, they will take me away . . .\\" It begins with sweetly picked acoustic guitar followed by driving keyboards and further intensified by insistent drums. Possibly the best track. *****+<br /><br />\\"Plastic\\" - features an off-kilter, unraveling sound like a slow-motion helicopter followed by white hot intensity.

I frankly find Beth's vocals to be terribly weak and I'm really not feeling the ukulele or the quaint minstrel back-up singers either. Some subversive purpose may be served here, but I still prefer to just skip this one. **<br /><br />\\"Machine Gun\\" - Underneath the jarring, mechanical atmosphere lies an amazing, futuristic-sounding song.

076532413X|3.0|What first attracted me to this novel was the premise.  It intrigued me to the point of buying the book, especially after I heard they were making a TV series out of it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the book.  I felt the author spent too much time explaining scientific theories, technology, etc. and not enough time advancing the plot or making it interesting.  I wanted a broader view of what happened with more peoples stories.  None of the characters stood out to me, and the main character, Lloyd Simcoe, was inconsistent throughout the book with his speech and actions.  Again, the idea was good, but the execution left something to be desired.
0547260695|5.0|I cannot stop raving about the sheer gorgeousness of this wonderful book, a favorite of mine for at least 40 years. This pop- up book is so cleverly and beautifully done, with little panels to open as well as the pop-ups themselves. Even if I had had to pay the full price for it, it would have been worth it....I am actually surprised that the full price was only $35 as the detailing is so extensive.<br /><br />This book will be treasured  ---and read and re-read.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I would have rated this a 10 if possible.  It's the first musical DVD I've purchased in years and I can't listen to it enough.  Inspiring and beautiful!  I am going to buy additional DVD's for Christmas and can't wait for her next release.

B001974DG0|5.0|I had never read Koontz before picking up The Watchers.  Once started, I couldn't put it down.  I wasn't surprised at the end to read that it is his favorite book.  I had read the reviews on this page which convinced me to buy the book.  I'm so glad I did.  I think you'll enjoy it too -- even if it's your first book of this genre. It's so much more than mere fantasy/horror.  Go for it!
B002ECJZ76|5.0|Christmas Story is a unique interpretation of the origin of Santa Claus that is different from anything I have seen. Produced in Finland, the story begins with parents leaving their young son in a small house on the edge of a lake while they take his infant sister to the village to see a doctor. Tragedy strikes and the boy becomes an orphan. That boy becomes Santa Claus.     I won't mention anymore of the story because I don't want to spoil it for anyone but what is unique about the story is that rather than relying on elves and magic flying reindeer and a mysterious workshop in the North Pole the story presents a very human Santa interested in honoring his lost parents and sister and those who have been kind to him when he was in need. The magic of Santa is as much in who Santa is rather than his delivering of toys on Christmas Eve which he also does.     The movie was shot in Finland with a Finnish cast. The filming was done at times in frigid conditions. Some filming was done in Lapland. The fact that the film was shot in conditions that we associate with Santa Claus adds to the film.  The scenery is amazing as well.        The movie has \\"Family Approved\\" and \\"Kids First\\" symbols on the box and I agree it is a good movie for children.  My only two concerns would be that this Santa is different from the Santa Claus we learn about in the United States with eight reindeer led by Rudolf and elves helping Santa with the presents. So if you have young children brought up with that interpretation of Santa Claus there may be questions. Also, as mentioned, death occurs in this movie. Some young children may be uncomfortable with the idea of Santa's parents and sister dying.     My only complaint is that while the film is in English the actors spoke Finnish and their lines were later dubbed in English.  As a result on a few occasions the actors mouths stopped moving while they were still speaking. The dubbing is done well but it must be hard to dub when you are changing languages. There is no option to watch the film in its original Finnish with English subtitles.  There is a \\"The Making of Christmas Story\\" feature with the actors speaking Finnish and with English subtitles. I wish the movie had that option as well.     This is a great movie worth adding to anyone's Christmas Collection.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|This album is an emotional roller coaster, beginning with an exhilarating crescendo and ending with a soft goodbye.  I suppose I can't make an unbiased review of this album, because it just fills me with so many emotions.  The first few tracks are strong, hopeful, and joyous.  Then the tracks become quieter and more subdued, but they're still imbued with feeling.  Get this album if you want music that will take your breath away, will make you think, and will make you feel.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Truly mindbending, Avatar is everything you expect it to be from visual standpoint, Cameron has created a brand new world here for sci-fi fans, and it feels right that he is back home in the sci-fi universe after the runaway success of Titanic. I was lucky enough to see this film at an advanced screening and all in attendance walked away in awe of what we had witnessed visually, even if the story is lacking as a whole. Said story is set in the year 2154 and involves a mission by U. S. Armed Forces to an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star. This new world, Pandora, is a rich source of a mineral Earth desperately needs. Pandora is a planetary forest inhabited by the peacful and graceful Na'vi, a blue-skinned, golden-eyed race of giants, each about 12 feet tall. We nevertheless send in the military to attack and conquer, though they are not a threat to us. There is clearly a military allegory about the nature of war mongering and the \\"noble savages\\" who often end up standing  in the way of the conquering superpower. Luckily Cameron controls his narrative from falling into the muck before it becomes an offensive stereotype by imbuing the story with heartfelt,if ocasionally stiff characterization. the hero, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is a paraplegic, recruited because he's a genetic match for a dead identical twin, who an expensive avatar was orignally created for. On Pandora, Jake is a good soldier and then goes native after his life is saved by the brave Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) who if she keeps this great acting up, (voice acting in this case) especially after Star Trek, may find herself with rockstar status in the scifi universe. Sigourney Weaver has a great turn in this film as well and turns in a strong performance. It is wonderful to see her back in a James Cameron film.  Michelle Rodriguez also makes a good turn in what could have been a throw away role. Visually he has unveiled the next generation of 3-D in \\"Avatar and wow does it leave you in awe! The interiors and rain forests in this film are like nothing you have ever seen and even the Na'vi are rendered so beautifully you can almost use the word sexy, both in their stop motion movements and the CGI. The creatures in this film are also a sight to behold, from the beauty of graceful, flying dragons which contains one of the films best scenes as Jakes tries to ride one of these beasts, to creatures that look like a mix between dandelion seeds and a jelly fish, and even the rendering of clouds, there is beauty in every frame. The entire range of his talent is on display here. Even more wonderfully he does so by never going so far as to create what some might call the \\"4th wall\\", or 4D animation. There is no need. He has left that territory for other directors. This is a world that lives and breathes in a way that is truly remarkable. Me thinks that if Stanley Kubrick's characters in \\"2001\\" had travelled even further they may have found a race just like this. Trippy and glorious, Avatar delivers Sci Fi like we have rarely seen it, making it a Merry holiday for Sci-fi fans Everywhere. This one will be off the wall in IMAX-- Get those tickets if you can, you will not be dissapointed that you did, trust me!<br /><br />Cast & CreditsJake Sully Sam Worthington<br />Neytiri Zoe Saldana<br />Grace Sigourney Weaver<br />Col.

0375758887|5.0|Overall, A Christmas Carol was a great book which would not be possible if Charles Dickens is not a wonderful author.  Out of all of the books I have read, A Christmas Carol has the most details told in the most exciting format.  Charles Dickens makes this book interesting because he does not have a paragraph in the beginning of the book that tells all of the details about each character, he gives clues to the reader about each of the characters and about the setting.  Many authors today like to state information about each character, so by the time you are finished reading about all of the characters in the book, you would forget about each one of them because reading all of the details about each character gets boring after a while.  The fifty page rule is not needed for this book.  The fifty page rule states that you should read up to page fifty in a book, and if the book does not interest you, then you can quit reading it and switch to another book that interests you.   Since Dickens does a wonderful job in giving the reader all of the details, the characters are easy to relate to.  There is the main character named Scrooge.  There is Bob Cratchit, who is Scrooge's secretary.  Then, there are the four ghosts: the ghost of Jacob Marley, Scrooge's dead partner in business; the ghost of Christmas past; the ghost of Christmas present; and the ghost of Christmas future.  In the story, Scrooge is a grumpy old miser who does not care about anybody except himself.  So, every time a charity has an annual donation at Christmas, Scrooge would not donate a penny.  Because of his selfish behavior, the ghost of Jacob Marley, who was also a miser when he was alive, came to Scrooge and told him to change.  But, Scrooge did not listen to the ghost of Marley, so Marley sent the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future to help Scrooge change.  Throughout the story, the ghosts of Christmas past, present, and future take Scrooge to certain time periods from when he was alittle boy to a deceased old man and each visit makes Scrooge more willing to change his selfish ways.  At the end of the story, Scrooge returns home from his journeys and promises the ghosts that he will change.   I think that this book should be read in schools, because the moral of this story needs to be in every person's daily life.  It is also a good book to be read in schools because Charles Dickens has a great writing technique that would be useful to learn.  This book also has a great story line.  I do not think that any person would get bored while reading this book.  Charles Dickens came up with a really good story line that is very exciting because of how Dickens presents the characters.  I wish I was as talented as Dickens in coming up with such a perfect story line.  This is definitely a book that everyone should read.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this today at Borders, and listened to it in my car on the way home.  I haven't even listened to the whole thing, but i can tell you that this CD is well worth having.  Susan Boyle surprised Simon, Piers, and the entire world with her voice on that YouTube clip, and it was NOT a fluke.  She has a marvelous voice, and her selection of music is a nice mix--it even ends with a Christmas hymn.  Buy it!  You'll like it!!
B000267JQK|5.0|I love the whole CD , makes me wonder why you need Disclaimer I , anyways My copy came with a DVD that has Broken , Gasoline and more on it .<br /><br />I highly recamend this CD
B002OHDRF2|1.0|If you want to watch a cartoon, buy \\"Snowhite and the Seven Dwarfs\\" or some other Disney animated feature.  Or if you want to wander through a game landscape and shoot at robot spiders and flying machines, buy the \\"Terminator:Salvation\\" game.  This DVD should be required to have a warning label (like those found on cigarettes.)  To say I was disappointed would be a gross understatement.  The animation was of poor quality and the lip-synching for the two characters was non-existent.  Even the old Japanese Gozilla and Mothra flicks were done better.      Instead of displaying the film in one episode, it was broken up into 6 episodes -- each with beginning and end titles and credits. Hey..I really enjoyed watching them over and over ad nauseum.  If the episodes were different, it might have made this thing more interesting but it was one chase scene after another with the spiders and flying machines shooting endlessly at the two human characters...and never hitting them.  It reminded me of those blackplotation flicks where the bad guys shoot at the black hero and never hit him while he shoots back and never misses the endless supply of bad guys.    Was I disappointed? Absolutely! Why did I give it only a \\"One-Star\\" rating? Because nothing lower was available.
B0026P3G12|3.0|Susan has an indisputably rich and wonderful voice, and I replay her introduction to the world on Britain's Got Talent whenever I need a lift. It's that 'lift' I was so anticipating when I ordered her CD, but it seems to be missing. It's not her voice, but rather the steady modulation of her songs that never brings me to my feet with exultation. I don't fault her but I think her producers have mis-judged what at least some of us were hoping for. How disappointing that even 'Daydream Believer' plays like a dirge. I hope in her next album she will really let loose, at least in a few songs, and lift our hearts as high as we know she can.
B000ZN802W|4.0|It is a sad story of a wasted young life while screening a natural beauty of America and her inhabitants, a 23-year-old main character inclusively.<br /><br />My Indonesia-made DVD is of a good jacket and a low technical quality substantially diminishing a pleasure at viewing this reality drama.
0440246164|5.0|Read this book all the way through non-stop. Great story!! Rumor is a movie may be made of the story. Gonna be damned hard to caprture on film.
B001974DG0|5.0|I am not sure just why I bought this book.  I'd never heard of Dean Koontz.  When I finally read it, I was thereafter hooked on Koontz's books.  Stephen King is a great and intriging writer about weird stuff but I am always glad that I have reached the end of one of his books.  Koontz is also a great writer.  Unlike King, you hate to have a Koontz book end.  As an added bonus, you are not left hanging in the wind like Stephen King frequently likes to do.  All you want is more.  Keep writing, Dean!
B002A4Q652|5.0|As you all may know, I absolutely love Metal music. I especially have a knack for Symphonic elements in Metal music; my favorite band Iron Maiden has done that before and they reached great heights with it. Which led me to get into Within Temptation, Kamelot, and Apocalyptica. However, while I had a friend of mine over back in the summer, she asked me if I had heard of Delain. After (shamefully) answering \\"no\\", we went on YouTube and listened to Control The Storm. I LOVED it! It was refreshing, like something I hadn't heard of before. A few days later, in HMV, I saw a copy of this, and picked it up. And wow, I was blown away instantly. The music was excellent, unlike something I've ever heard. Charlotte Wessels has a BEAUTIFUL singing voice!!!! She is very Karen Carpenter-like, she has a lovely and clean voice, and soars on the songs. She doesn't once oversing, she has perfect control over her voice. The symphony adds total effect to the mood, most of the songs have a dark mood, and the symphony is spectacular. MUST HEAR TRACKS would be Control the Storm, I'll Reach You, and Start Swimming. Overall, if you like symphonic metal, give this one a listen. You will not regret it.
0823016714|2.0|It's great to have all of the photographs of various people from different angles, but none of them are labeled.  The author says that he asked the people in the photographs to act various feelings like \\"scared, angry, etc.\\", but he leaves that mapping out of the book.  For me, it makes it almost useless.
B00127RAJY|3.0|Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred does deliver 3 solid workout.    PRO's:  There are 3 different workouts which is a good value.  The workouts are very challenging! You can get in a good workout in 26 minutes.  Jillian gives good tips on form.  There is someone doing a modified version which is good for beginners.  These workouts can really change your body in a short amount of time.    CON's  Jillian uses profanity in these workouts.  If you work out while your kids are around, don't get this dvd.  I took off one star because I do not consider this a family friendly dvd.  With some excercises, specifically the strength work, there are uneven reps. The music is Boring and out of sync with the exercises.      Personal experience:  I did have good success with this dvd.  However, I must say that I did not look forward to it everyday.  I really dreaded it. I wanted to reach a goal and used this dvd to help meet that goal.  I did not lose a lot of weight, but I did lose a lot of inches.  Regarding the music not being in sync, whenever I read this same comment from people prior to my review, I thought they were being silly.  I WAS WRONG!  I have several exercise DVD's and haven't really \\"loved\\" any of them.  The only ones I actually like were winsor pilates.  I needed more cardio though.  So I tried Turbo Jam and LOVED it.  What was the big thing that made it so fun for me and made me look forward to it everyday?  THE MUSIC!  The music is great and the exercises are synced with with the music.      Bottom Line:  If you want to change your body in a short amount of time, don't mind boring music and cussing, this may be the dvd for you!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is a film ahead of it's time...HDTV and blu-ray are what this film was made for!  I remember the first video of this...good but just another sci-fi movie, with blu-ray and recut/remastered it is almost real. Every version and comment on the movie and for those not in North America this version is region free.  The best bargain you will get in Amazon everyone should buy it and see what blu-ray is all about
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is my new favorite movie! My kids (2 and 7) both love it and my husband and I adore it as well. We recommend it to everyone who loves dogs, adventure, funny, silly, sweet, family, children or just a plain good movie. Have watched it half a dozen times and it is still funny and hasn't gotten old yet!Worth every penny!
B002JODV3S|5.0|Steve Vai is one of the greastest guitarists ever, and this can be plainly seen in this video. The addition of two violinists to the band makes for a unique experience. Even if you've seen Vai before, the new configuration of the band has allowed him to explore some new variations on his material, including doing an acoustic set in the middle of the show. Also, this Blu-Ray is simply the best concert video I've ever watched. Both the sound and the video are amazing quality. The disc has plenty of extras, including a band commentary, interviews with the band members, and Steve's product demo for his Jemini distortion pedal. This is one worth owning.
0307269981|1.0|I hated THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. I thought it was a boring, cliche-ridden, bloated mess. The Lisbeth Salander character was, by far, the best thing about it...unfortunately,  the story centered primarily on Michael Blomkvist, a thinly disguised, idealized version of the author himself and the magazine he founded. It's an awful book.<br /><br />The only reason I read the sequel, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE, is because so many people told me it was a much better book than TATTOO...and that it would make me understand the phenomenon. To some degree, they are right. The first third of the book is centered on Salander and her adventures abroad and back in Sweden...which actually are a lot of fun to read, if you can get past all the cliches (more on that in a minute). Salander is a great character that's stuck, unfortunately,  in two lousy novels.<br /><br />The instant Michael Blomkvist returns, and even before he takes the spotlight, the book becomes overwhelmed with dull exposition (which is repeated endlessly, telling you the same facts over and over and over again), ridiculous coincidences, and pointless scenes that neither move the story forward nor reveal character. The characters become so thin that calling them \\"cardboard\\" would be giving them more substance and depth than they actually have. As if this wasn't punishment enough for the reader, the cliche-count radically increases as the book slogs on until it seems like there's one in every paragraph. Here are just a few of them:<br /><br />\\"Nutty as a fruitcake\\"<br /><br />\\"Go jump in a lake.\\"<br /><br />\\"he's pulling my leg.\\"<br /><br />\\"too many irons in the fire.\\"<br /><br />\\"out like a light.\\"<br /><br />\\"keep it under our hats.\\"<br /><br />\\"like a hot potato.\\"<br /><br />\\"you're clutching at straws.\\"<br /><br />\\"afraid he'd spill the beans.\\"<br /><br />\\"the penny dropped.\\"<br /><br />\\"she's a loose cannon.\\"<br /><br />\\"cool as a cucumber.\\"<br /><br />\\"fight tooth and nail.\\"<br /><br />\\"kept her nose clean.\\"<br /><br />\\"fly in the ointment\\"<br /><br />And so it goes, on and on, one dusty old cliche after another. By far the most used cliche in the book is \\"Hung out to dry/hang out to dry.\\" It was used a dozen times before I gave up counting. I doubt these are Swedish cliches, so I blame the translator for being a lazy hack...and his editor for not doing his job.<br /><br />This is a truly terrible book on just about every level. That said, it's marginally better than TATTOO by virtue of the first third.he in the book is \\"Hung out to dry/hang out to dry.\\" It was used a dozen times before I gave up counting.

B00005JLCI|3.0|I have liked Kenneth Branagh's other Shakespeare films. I appreciate that he doesn't reduce the plays to sing-songy recitals. Having said that, he seems to have a weakness for some inappropriate casting. Let's start with Jack Lemmon. I like Jack Lemmon. He is a gifted comedic and dramatic actor, but he had no business whatsoever playing a guard in Shakespeare's Hamlet. Now, I know Ophelia's supposed to be mad, but Kate WInslett's Ophelia is simply incoherent most of the time. I'd have preferred Helena Bonham Carter, but with her you have to take Mel Gibson as Hamlet.  The choice of Julie Christie as Gertrude, on the other hand, is inspired. Her performance makes sense of a woman who would sleep with her murderous former brother-in-law.   All of the plot points are made clearly for once, but except for Hamlet's ambiguity about the status of humanity in the cosmos, most of the subtle stuff gets short shrift.

0780622650|3.0|I loved the TV series LOST IN SPACE when I was a kid. Then, I got a chance to watch it as an adult and... well, let me just say that many fond memories were destroyed! While I still enjoy the entire first season (in glorious b+w), I find the psychedelically colored \\"camp\\" episodes of seasons two and (especially) three, to be nearly unwatchable. The movie version is a modern retelling of the story (mostly from season one) of the Robinson family, complete w/ spiffy new outfits and an upgraded B9 robot. William Hurt and Mimi Rogers make a decent enough John and Maureen Robinson. Heather Graham is a stolid, yet beautiful Judy, and Matt LeBlanc is a cynical, sarcastic Don West. Will Robinson (Jack Johnson) is the genius / whiz-kid of the family, able to retro-fit just about any gadget. Penny (Lacey Chabert) is basically a throw-away role w/ little to do. Gary Oldman (Hannibal, The Fifth Element) gets the juicy part of the eeevil Dr. Zachary Smith. He's far more cunning and less of a sniveling whimp than his TV counterpart. He's also far more interesting than anyone else in the movie! LOST IN SPACE isn't terrible, it's just not a classic. Even so, it is certainly better than the the final two seasons of the show...

B0017HMF6W|5.0|I was introduced to this movie for a classroom exercise nearly 40 years ago. I became a Hitchcock fan for life. That \\"movie\\" print I saw back then was a 4x3 \\"pan and scan\\" version which was still great. Since then, I must have seen this movie 30-40 times, and most recently, always in its intended aspect ratio - although usually in a televised \\"letterbox\\" format.    I've owned it on videotape but, as it wasn't included in the Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection, never on dvd. I always intended to purchase it separately, but never wanted to pay big $ to do it. I even ordered it once from Amazon, only to find it sold out a few years back.    I jumped at the chance to order this new 50th Anniversary edition on blu-ray, and I was blown away. I've never seen a print with this clarity. Every scene looks like it was filmed yesterday. With a decent player and tv, this is one of the absolute best transfers I have ever seen. This disc is a bargain at twice the price (I got it for $20).    If you are a fan of this film (and you should be), it's almost a crime not to own it in this format. I've seen dozens of films that did not impress from the Blu upgrade, but this is not one of them. I can't say enough. Spectacular. You won't be disappointed.

6305907145|4.0|It's extremely rare that a film improves upon the original. \\"Gone With the Wind\\" and \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" are two of the few. However, the 1999 film version of \\"Mansfield Park,\\" Jane Austen's least satisfying novel, is yet another.<br /><br />Austen purists may well be appalled, but Frances O'Connor brings to life a heroine more in the classic Austen mode, more like Elizabeth Bennett or Marianne Dashwood. O'Connor's Fanny is clever and witty -- a vast improvement over the priggish milquetoast Fanny of the novel! The film is supplemented from Austen's own letters, making Fanny more representative of Austen herself than of the moralizing, nebbishy Fanny of the book.<br /><br />To those who sniff that this filmed version isn't true to the spirit of the novel's Fanny Price, I say hip, hip, hooray!!
1589944607|5.0|I was extremely skeptical of this when I received it as a gift last Christmas.  I am a big BSG fan, but I didn't really think it would work as a board game.  Even then, can a board game even come close to matching the spirit of BSG?  It turns out that it can and did, and is very fun to play.  I tried it out with two friends, one who was a fellow BSG fan and another who had never watched the show before.  Both really took to it (though I got a lot of questions from my one friend about \\"What is a Cylon again?\\"), and we had a great time.    That being said, this is a very heady game, not to be played casually.  Seriously, we took about 4 hours to get through one game of this.  Later plays have been shorter and longer, but plan to be there for at least 3-3.5 hours, even if you're ready for the complex rules.  You really have to pay attention to the rules, and keep the booklet handy, but it still is a heck of a lot of fun and gets you paranoid about who you can trust and who you cannot among your friends.  That being said, it does ask you to get 'into' character more than any other boardgame I have done before, and is kind of like a mashup between a boardgame and a role-playing game.    I may have been wary of this before, but now I enjoy it and recommend it for anyone with a cluster of BSG fans or boardgame/RPG lovers, because this will be a lot of fun for everyone.
1593081545|2.0|It's rare when the film version triumphs over the novel original; however, that's the case with Jane Austen's \\"Mansfield Park.\\" Unlike the clever Elizabeth Bennett of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or the lovely and lively Emma, Fanny Price is moralizing and priggish to a fault. Even Austen's own mother declared Fanny \\"insipid\\"! I love the other novels, even the underrated \\"Lady Susan,\\" but I could not finish this one.<br /><br />Instead of reading the novel, enjoy the 1999 film version: [[ASIN:6305907145 Mansfield Park (1999)]]. Frances O'Connor creates a spunky, witty version of Fanny Price that deviates from the novel and is all the better for it.

B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Ponyo is a young fish-girl who loves to explore, but her father, a great wizard of the sea, fears the chaos her untamed powers could unleash upon the world.  He's right to worry, since she, like every young undomesticated child, is an elemental force of nature who has little respect for the boundaries that grownups take so seriously.  She escapes and meets up with a young boy whose imagination at least is a match for her magical powers - and it is love at first sight.  Not romantic love but something more innocent and pure - like the youthful love of nature.<br /><br />It starts out strong - and contains some of Miyazaki's most delightful and exuberant imagery, as when Ponyo runs blissfully upon the backs of her sisters who are at once giant fish and enormous waves.  The story itself as it develops has gaps, moments that don't all add up, and unexplained elements.  As another reviewer mentioned, for example, the test that Fujimoto and the sea goddess devise for Sosuke is somewhat anticlimactic, unlike the tests faced by the heroine of [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]].  I had the suspicion several times that perhaps Disney cut things out for its U.S. release - since the plot lacked some of the depth and richness in its backstory of many of Miyazaki's other works.  A bit of searching shows I was wrong - this is the film Hayao Miyazaki intended.  He is quoted in the L.A. Daily News as saying: \\"I intentionally tried to simplify things for this film. I figured that this movie should be seen by 5-year-olds, since they are the main characters. So I made the storytelling easy to understand. I figured they could watch it later as adults and understand the more complex parts of it, so I didn't foreground those elements.\\"  In hindsight he may be right -- from a young person's perspective what matters is just the magical relation between two young children, and from their perspective everything else, the fate of the cosmos, even, hinges on that.<br /><br />Like most of his films, there is an ecological message here, that humans tend to ignore the wonders around them and treat carelessly the gift of the earth.  Here it is expressed in an entertaining and magical story that will be easily understood by children.  While, from the perspective of an adult viewer, I found this film less fully satisfying than masterpieces like [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXBK Princess Mononoke]], or even the delicate and rich [[ASIN:B0001XAQ0A My Neighbor Totoro]] - which is the closest in spirit to this film - still it contains some remarkable and beautiful imagery and delightful moments.  Well worth watching, and a very lovely and simple introduction to the work of one of the most inventive and important animated storytellers alive.  There's no one else quite like him, and we're lucky to have another Miyazaki film, especially given his initial plans to retire upon completing the Academy Award-winning [[ASIN:B00005JLEU Spirited Away]].  Highly recommended.ms, there is an ecological message here, that humans tend to ignore the wonders around them and treat carelessly the gift of the earth.

B001P22HK8|4.0|Daemon is a fast-paced cyberpunk suspense novel that stretches the status quo of technology, but not outlandishly so. It was an entertaining read, and I had a very hard time putting it down. Like many of Doctorow's books, it simultaneously entertains and educates the reader -- even someone with a decent amount of technical expertise like myself will likely find out one or two things he or she is not familiar with, especially if he or she doesn't know a lot about the black-hat side of the hacking spectrum.    Other reviewers have summarized the plot well enough, so I won't do that. While the book started out brilliantly, and felt like things were being set up for a really spectacular finale, toward the middle or just after I realized that there wasn't enough book left to wrap up all of the loose ends that had been introduced. Sure enough, a lot of plot lines were quickly dropped or closed in ways that didn't quite make sense. Too many characters were introduced but then never followed up on. Character development even for the main characters was a bit shallow. One of the best-developed characters appeared very few times.    Apparently this is Suarez's first novel, and I wasn't in the loop about him or it until recently. It's a promising book, and the expertise acquired in his day job shines through. The problems mentioned above probably stem from his relative lack of experience writing novels. I look forward to more polished books from Suarez. Even this book, in its incomplete wrap-up, leaves room for a sequel or two [edit: apparently there is a sequel to be released January 7th, Freedom (tm)], which might remedy some of the remaining open loops. Perhaps that was intentional?    I debated whether to give it four (because of the problems) or five stars (because it was still such a fun read), but given the rough edges I couldn't justify a five-star rating. If you like cyberpunk and like suspense, you'll almost certainly enjoy this book. Here's hoping for more along thesame line from Suarez.    (Side note: Most of the computers in this book seem not to have much memory -- they invariably thrash the hard drive when doing basically anything. What gives?)

B0026P3G12|2.0|Susan Boyle has a wonderful voice.  This cd is uninspiring.  The song choices leave a lot to be desired.  While I do like religious music I think there might be too many on this cd.  They should have been saved for another cd with religion in mind.  There are so many wonderful songs that could have been in this first cd.  What's here is sad.  Ending with a Christmas song is ok for the time of year, but really ... it could have waited for her to do a Christmas cd next year. This is a hodgepodge of music that does not do Susan Boyle justice.  I wish I paid more attention to the song choices before buying the cd.  I played it once and I'm not sure when I'll be playing it again.  Maybe I'll sell it on line.

B000002LMM|5.0|The music of Angelo Badalamenti often has this mysterious quality to it which keeps you involved and in suspense appropriate to the viewing experience of the movie scenes the music was design to accompany. I have never watched neither the Twin Peaks movies nor tv series (and it is something I'm still looking forward to do some day), but I have seen both Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive and I do know how his music interacts with the movies by David Lynch. I do love surrounding myself with the soundtrack music of Angelo Badalamenti and to have his mysterious, often emotional, unique ambient moods become part of my listening experience. The music of the soundtrack to Twin Peaks has this special spooky aspect to it which makes this album even more unique to Angelo Badalamenti. Our experience has a lot to do with the engineering of sound where melodies seem to flow a bit off center; the focus is turned to the ambient noise and arrangements keeping us a bit on the edge of something (in the words of the composer himself) `tragically beautiful'. This phrase describes the mood perfectly. I am really attracted to how mellow this soundtrack is overall. It is soothing and relaxing and after a few hours of being within this music you may also find yourself a bit withdrawn from your every day's reality and closer to your world of dreams. Try listening to track number 8 Night Life In Twin Peaks on repeat 1 for a couple of hours. It gets quite bizarre after a while.  Many of Angelo's soundtracks are very good, but overall this one is my favorite one. My favorite songs by Angelo Badalamenti are the following: Rose's Theme, Fire Walk With Me, Mysteries Of Love, Twin Peaks Theme, Miette, Mulholland Drive, Rose's Theme Delayed, Final Elevator, Laura Palmer's Theme, Gacnacrique, Why Do You Cry?, Diane And Camillia, Nightingale, Theme From The Comfort Of Strangers, Overture For The Wicker Man, Questions In The World Of Blue, Mysteries Of Love Instrumental, Falling.
B001GCUO4S|5.0|Paranormal Activity is one of the best horror movies of 2009. Paranormal Activity has just surprised the blair witch project as the most profitable movie ever. The box office hit was made less than $15,000 and as Wednesday has grossed a whopping $65.1. It's horror in the truest sense of the word. Some people make commentaries about what they think most people say it's just a horror movie, but Paranormal Activity goes beyond a simple horror movie to be the best horror movie of the year.

Why in the world someone would choose rap music on an MJ song is confusing to me. MJs name doesn't even show up on the credits (not surprising).

But, it doesn't take away from the wealth of information provided.  This book gives the same, and perhaps more infomation than it's predecessors selling for much more.

1594488916|3.0|This book started as a magazine article and I am sure it was a great magazine article.  As a book, it was a tad lacking, although appropriately short.    The author established relationships with two people in the rare book trade, an inveterate book thief and a store owner who headed security for the association of rare book collectors who caught him.  As she relates the histories of the two men, many sidenotes and anecdotes about the trade and especially the its thefts are thrown into the mix.  The anecdotal histories were much more interesting than the author's long musings about the motivations of the thief.    One disconcerting note, however, was how much the author became a part of the book even though she was the mere interviewer/narrator.  It was a rather self-centered rendition.    All that having been said, this is a rather quick read with interesting anecdotes about the rare book trade, particularly its security and lack thereof.  At its center are the thief and his captor.  The unique aspect of this story is how many books and how unrepentent the thief was and still is.  Recommended if you have a great interest in the rare book trade.  If not, I think your reaction would be: \\"Why didn't I just read this in a magazine?\\"

0440180295|5.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is a great stepping stone into the work of profoundly wise writer-philosopher. Although some may not identify with the bleakness and postmodernity of the work, if you enter this novel with an open mind, you will leave it with Vonnegut in your heart. It's tempting to say that this book is about absurdity, existentialism, quietism. War, meaning, peace. But I think the most poignant take-home from this brilliant satire is simple and resounding.    Don't cry about death and chaos defining our fragile lives. Laugh about it. It'll get you through.    Those three little words will get you through.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This apparently little known movie features a great cast, fun & lighthearted storyline and a fantastic soundtrack. I thoroughly enjoyed the humor, dialogue, special effects and action sequences. Similar in genre to the Princess Bride, but with higher production values. I don't recommend it for kids as its a little dark/scary at times for young children... Definitely a good date movie, etc. Highly recommended.
B002RSDW80|5.0|My friend forewarned me that I would love this film since I have always loved to bake and cook and hope to one day make that my life.  I share some similarities with the main character, making this film even more enjoyable for myself.<br /><br />Meryl Streep does a wonderful job portraying Julia Child and showing a side of her personality most people would likely not know to have existed.  My mother told me when she watched her on TV she didn't show personality like she did on this movie.  Learning about how she came into cooking, later in her life & after her marriage, gave a new perspective on her cooking style and her famous french cookbooks (which I just ordered the hardcover set due to my desire to replicate many of delicious cuisines shown in the film).  I have to say true french restaurants & cuisine is hard to find where I live, so I can't say I have longed for it or known how to make it -- but now I can't wait to try it out.<br /><br />In truth, the movie is mostly about Julie, played by Amy Adams, who plays an average American woman who hates her job and lives in a less-than-desirable apartment with her husband over a pizza place.  Amy Adams portrayal of Julie makes her annoying and aggravating at times, but for the most part an adventurous character wanting to figure out how to give her life meaning.  Julie's relationship with her husband is sometimes very similar to Julia Child's relationship with her husband; however, throughout the film there is a significant difference between their relationship likely related to the difference in age, experience, and ultimately what the movie is about - Julie's need to define herself and figure out how to change her life.<br /><br />I think this film was great for entertainment, good for those who love to look at food, fun for friends and family, but also very re-watchable -- something I always value in a movie.  If on the fence of watching it, at least rent it as I have fond memories of it already and enjoyed sharing the experience with my mom.my mom.
0307269981|5.0|I read the first book in this series and immedciatly ordered \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" from Amazon.com.  I could hardly wait to start reading it.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Movie studios should have done this from the beginning.  A digital copy plus a copy for use with hardware.  I keep the BD disc, the kids get the DVD, I load the digital copy on the HTPC for transfer to media players.  Nice.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I have been a fan of Star Trek since it first came out and believe the phrase, \\"Star Trek is like sex, even when it is bad, it is pretty good.\\"  When I heard that a pre-quel was coming out I wasn't sure how it would fit in with the \\"history\\".  After seeing the movie I was pleased with the way it was done.  Very little of the canon was violated.  The franchise was extended in an innovative and truly \\"Star Trek\\" way.  This alternate history has opened the show up to new movies and a new audience.  If this is how the franchise is to \\"Live long and prosper.\\"  then it is in good hands.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|Early in this book Stephen King recounts a discussion with a fellow author.  They laugh about how often fans ask them where they get story ideas.  \\"But they never ask about the language,\\" muses King.  This book is his answer to that oft-unasked question.<br /><br />The first section of the book describes King's childhood fascination with horror and early writing experiences--including articles in a newsletter his brother \\"published\\" from their garage.  In the second section King gets down to business, providing practical advice ranging from word choices to editing practices and how to pace the long-term work of writing.  King returns the book's focus to his own life in the final section.  He describes being hit by a car while walking along the road and the challenges and insights of his recovery.<br /><br />This book is recommended not just for Stephen King fans, but for anyone who wants to improve their writing.  After enjoying it myself, I convinced two of my children to read it.  Both found it a helpful perspective on their writing, in school and out in the world.  Satisfied readers may also want to try [[ASIN:0425104338 Danse Macabre]], Kings exploration of what makes us afraid, and [[ASIN:0165006439 Secret Windows]], his collection of short stories and essays on writing.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|I did like this album.  He sings some songs that I felt were  more his and not just singing songs from the past.  He reminds me of Frank Sinatra and some of the singers from the past.  I like Michael's work and believe this is the best album I have heard from him.

B000005IS1|4.0|I like the reviewer who says this is not a 'greatest hits' album. i wasn't aware that this was a top 40 band. Maybe he thought it was the DC5. This is a very interesting live album, it was shocking in '68, it is hard to listen to the whole album (the original live album), the whole album is washed out in feedback, and this is a great band who never got recorded well. The best is 'back in USA' for proto-punk songs- it is tinny sounding and over before you know it. And despite all that, this and 'USA' are fantastic, essential listening. And i don't care which reissue this and the demo tracks are from. I loved the revolutionary aspect of it at the time. But i'm old now, and i think Nixon was a great president.

B002UXRH10|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  Being a newer Rihanna fan who hasn't consistently listened to GGGB in its entirety- I didn't quite know what to expect when \\"Rated R'was constantly hailed as \\"darker\\". Sometimes it's best when you don't have anything to directly compare a project to, since it allows the art to be somewhat isolated.    I had already heard \\"Wait your turn\\" and loved it.  It hits very hard at first, showcasing Rihanna's accent in a rap like cadence.  Then the chorus comes in with beautiful melodies - a real delight. Very balanced and unique, usually female artists have to enlist the help of a male hip hop artist to create this sound - Rihanna stood her ground by creating the sound solo.  I also loved the message behind the \\"Wait your turn\\" lyrics - the phrase \\"sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win\\" really spoke to me and my own attempts at my goals. This song is one of my absolute favorites - a stunning declaration of strength and perserverance wrapped in a hard beat and flowing lyrical delivery.    \\"Hard\\" featuring young Jeezy is infectious - I am admittedly not \\"hard\\" myself, but find myself rockin' with puffed up bravado when listening to this track.  Harnessing my inner \\"hard\\" chick.  Russian Roulette is dark yet beautiful - another gem that drew me to buy the album.  Beautiful vocals and interesting metaphor that is not lost on those of us who do not take art as strictly literal.    I enjoy \\"Rock star\\" quite a bit, being a black woman who has always loved rock music - the fact that Rih blends genres truly speaks to that part of me.  It's a fun and lighthearted song - with an egotistical rocker twist of course.    \\"Firebomb\\" - wow... this song is so atmospheric and the vocals are quite lovely.  \\"The lovers need to clear the road\\" - this is one of those songs that transcends beyond whether you like Rihanna or not.  The lyrics are solid, and musically it is classic - edgy soft rock at its best.    \\"Photographs\\" - I really love this song- will i am did his thing on this one.  Rihanna uses a higher pitched sing-song voice that makes the song poppy - a welcome anecdote to the sad break-up nature of the lyrics.  It makes me want to dance - and how often do nostalgic break-up songs do that?    \\"Te amo\\" is just lovely with it's Latin rhythm and Rihanna once again showcasing her beautiful accent.  The subject matter is also very appropriate for the times we live in - with Rihanna gently spurning the affections of a woman who wants to be more than her friend.  Very sensual yet sophisticated song.    \\"Cold Case Love\\" is very haunting and beautiful.  The parallel between a murder investigation and a perilous relationship is a unique one.  Talk of crime scene photographs allude to Rihanna's own disturbing photograph taken after she suffered domestic abuse.  Good song.    Now for the bad - I am not a fan of gratuitous cursing or vulgarity, therefore G4L did not appeal to me at all.  I could forgive the cursing in other songs, as I really like those songs a lot and did not find it overwhelming. However, artistically, I believe Rihanna deserved to express the aggressive/angry part of her, especially with all that has occurred in the past year. I mean, I did buy the explicit version after all - hence the five star rating in spite of...    In closing, \\"Rated R\\" is a smart album that has continuity and depth.  I, for one, am glad that Rihanna kept it real regarding her artistic evolution, and did not try to reproduce the same album twice.  I am also impressed that she did not appear to try to prove to everyone that she is \\"okay, peachy keen\\" -  but allowed her pain to morph into real, honest, and delightful music.  I look forward to what is to come from her over the next several years.  She strikes me as genuine and strong as steel - a great combo for any musical artist.
B0029LHW68|3.0|So, I can't say this is a bad album like a lot of the other people but I think it is definately a step back for the band. I always try to see things from the perspective of the musicians and that's where I get confused here. Now, was their goal to create a radio ready album or do they get pushed in that direction? I have always liked 30 Sec but I always thought that they should concentrate on making straight-forward, edgy, and raw music. I always hope that bands are trying to progress with each album but I don't that's not the case this time. This album feels over-produced and like they went out of their way to make as many top 40 singles as possible. In that way, it doesn't seem natural to me much like all of the crap they do with the chorus vocals and talentless pitch shifting effects.     That being said, the only thing that saves this album is the fact that Leto is an amazing vocalist. If he was just average, \\"This Is War\\" would completely fail. It's hard to listen to something when you have to dig under layers of production to find the talent in a band. I understand why certain people love this album. If I am in the mood for pop music that's great but I don't expect a band to transform into that. I think others on here are very happy about. I don't think this band needs to do the theme song for the next Transformers movie but after this, I wouldn't be surprised. Like I said, there is nothing wrong with pop unless it's fake.
0451169514|4.0|What a story teller Stephen King is. I'm not gonna go in depth in my detail because there are a bunch of awesome reviews already up. So many in fact, that this may go unread. Even so, I felt a strong desire to write my first amazon review.     This book was really great. I'd give it four and a half if I could figure out how, but for now just four.  It is slow in some parts, but for the most part its pretty fast based, interesting, fun, and yes, scary.  With that said, it does get very weird near the end and I think King may have gone a little too \\"out there\\" for my taste.  He comes right back though, and ends spectacularly.  The real terror isn't in \\"It\\" though, the real terror is his message in the last ten pages. It made me cry to think about his message about memories, and how unfortunate it is that they fade. Really, just a wonderful book all around that makes you rethink your childhood from an interesting perspective.     I hope you take a chance on this book, don't get daunted by the page count

B002GJT4XW|5.0|We just got our blu-ray player, after holding out for so long.  So, naturally, I am on a blu-ray buying spree.  So far, of all of the blu-ray discs I have watched in high definition on our 1080p HD TV, these new \\"Ultimate Editions\\" of the Harry Potter films, have impressed me the most.<br /><br />I am *NOT* an audio/video expert.  However, I can say that the films look crisp and sharp, to me.  We are playing the discs on a Playstation 3 using an HDMI connection to our Sony Bravia Z-Series 46-Inch 1080p 120Hz LCD HDTV.  The sound is quite nice as well.  We don't have a full digital audio setup, but we do have a limited 2.1 sound system attached to our setup, and the sound seems to be better on the blu-ray discs, than the DVDs.  But that may just be a placebo affect.<br /><br />I was worried that because the films we made quite a while before blu-ray came out, or before it was super-common to film all digitally, and in high definition, that what we would end up with would be an upscaled version of the DVD footage, showing heavy grain and looking blurry.  I can say that it doesn't look like that at all.  It looks fantastic.  Like the actors are right there in the room with you.  Additionally, the blu-ray disc contains both the theatrical release, and the new extended version with cut scenes put back in.  A *LOT* of scenes make more sense with those scenes back in.  It helps if you have read the books, but if you haven't, then those extra scenes make the movies make more sense.<br /><br />As for the extras, the booklet is nice, and has some interesting photos (and very little in the way of words or explanations to explain them).  The case is fantastic, and high quality (the interior case which is the big box right inside the slipcover is the same kind of pseudo-leather the LOTR extended versions use, AND it has a nifty magnetic clasp to hold itself shut!).  The over-sized trading cards are ridiculous and clearly a gimmick (but they are well made).  The DVD copy has all of the old special features from previous releases.  However, if you are a super-fan of the books and movies, it will be the blu-ray special features disc that you buy this set for.  Specifically, for the hour long documentary included in each ultimate edition containing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff I have been wanting to see for such a long time now!  They also do in depth interviews, and show stuff we have never seen before, like the actors screen tests, and their green-screening techniques.<br /><br />I loved the set, I loved the price, I loved the quality of the films in HD, and I loved the extras.  5 stars, all the way!res from previous releases.

B002UXRH10|1.0|Another polluted artist I won't buy anymore. Loved her second album but now that she is a potty mouth like many other once clean and now dirty artists I don't even want to ever hear her again. I am deleting her second album off of my PC and iPod. No wonder I don't like mainstream music anymore and listing to alot more 80's and the only music I like today is Trance EDM.
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|I made a much longer review about the Ultimate editions of the Harry Potter films in the review I posted for the [[ASIN:B002GJT4XW Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]] so I am just going to go over the highlights concerning this specific film in this review.  For full details on why I think the Ultimate Editions are awesome, see my [[ASIN:B002GJT4XW Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]] review.<br /><br />The HD video and sound are excellent in this version of the film on blu-ray, just like they were for the other Ultimate Edition release.  Yes, they are double dipping on this release (which is one of the reasons I think the price is relatively low), but I think it is worth it considering the fact that we are getting the extended edition of the film in blu-ray HD, plus an hour's long documentary with never before seen behind the scenes stuff as well.<br /><br />The blu-ray disc contains both the theatrical release, and the new extended version with cut scenes put back in.  This film has 13 minutes of extra footage (most never seen before).  The extra footage makes a *LOT* of scenes make more sense with those scenes back in!  For instance, one of the new scenes shows Harry meeting Hagrid on the stairs on his way up to his dormitory.  Hagrid is holding the dead chickens which were being killed in the book.  Minutes later Harry stumbled upon the Hufflepuff boy who has been petrified by the basilisk. Minutes after that, as Harry is in Dumbledore's office explaining himself, Hagrid bursts in saying he knows it couldn't have been Harry, and that he would be willing to swear so to the Ministry of magic.  With the extra scene back in showing Harry and Hagrid meeting on the stairs, it suddenly becomes clear how a.) Hagrid got there so fast, b.) how Hagrid knew Harry was in trouble, c.) that Hagrid was so SURE Harry was innocent.  You will encounter scenes that expand your understanding of the films like that all over the extended edition.<br /><br />As for the extras, the blu-ray special features disc is the reason to buy this set.  Specifically, for the hour long documentary included in each ultimate edition containing all of the behind-the-scenes stuff I have been wanting to see for such a long time now!  They also do in depth interviews, and show stuff we have never seen before.  I LOVED watching all of the green screening stuff they showed concerning Quidditch, the flying car, etc.<br /><br />I love the set, I love the price, I love the quality of the films in high definition blu-ray, and I love the extras.  5 stars, for this edition, no question.d edition.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|In the fourth season of \\"Dexter,\\" America's favorite serial killer is dealing with a lot of change. Newly married, Dexter (Michael C. Hall) has acquired two step-children and is the father of a baby son. He's also hot on the tail of antoher serial killer, dubbed as the Trinity Killer (John Lithgow). Dexter gets close to Trinity early in the season but is shocked to discover many similarities between him and the madman, so he stalls on killing Trinity in hopes of learning a thing or two from him. All of this leads up to the most fantastic, overwhelming, and completely shocking season of \\"Dexter\\" ever. I'll be so bold as to say that I have never, in my 30 years of life, seen a season finale of any television show as jarring as the last three minutes of Season Four of \\"Dexter.\\" It is UN-FREAKING-BELIEVABLE, and proof that this series is one of the greatest shows in all of television history. (The only bad thing about the season is that it caused me to develop a recurring nightmare of John Lithgow appearing naked in my bathroom...long story.) Season Five is sure to be incredible...I can't wait!

I guess thats why EMI did not rerelease it when they did all the '96 remasters.<br /><br />The first cd version in '92 on Dojo records was a vinyl transfer and sounds reasonable.  Then in '93 a Canadian company, Griffin, sourced the American vinyl master, which was a copy of a copy, and used that as the basis for their cd.  That version sounds better and is the preferred one.  The sound is good given the source.  There is no 'loudness war' junk (google or wikipedia it if you don't know what it is), so the music is fairly dynamic.  The eq suffers though as the bass is very anemic and the top end a little too dominant.  But overall, the sound is better than the Dojo version.<br /><br />*****************The Music<br />I think this is their second best release behind 'The Space Ritual'.  It is quintessential Hawkwind.<br /><br />It starts with the amazing 'Assault and Battery/The Golden Void'.  Great double drumming, Mellotron, synths, flutes, saxes, and great fuzz from Brock and Lemmy.  Lemmy's bass played shocked me when I first heard it as I only knew him from the proto-punk noise of Motorhead.  I was amazed how creative and innovative his Hawkwind work was.  Too bad he was kicked out and started playing just thrash bass.<br /><br />The next track is 'The Wizard Blew His Horn'.  Some people don't like Morecock's spoken word contributions, but I quite enjoy them.<br /><br />'Opa-Loka' is an experimental jam.<br /><br />'The Demented Man' is a folk based song that harkens back to their first release, a very good acoustic song.<br /><br />'Magnu' is a driving rocker with an Arabic touch.

B002AOWXQ8|5.0|When it's time to name the Song of the Year, list-makers who don't put \\"Home\\" in their Top Five may come to feel...sheepish.<br /><br />That's because there's a medicine show coming your way, guaranteed to cure whatever ails you. And the best service someone like me can provide is to prepare you for it. That's simple: you're going to dance. Pretty much from minute one. With whomever you're with. With strangers. And with a massive, how-did-this happen grin on your face.<br /><br />Maybe you could know a bit more. Like: there is no \\"Edward Sharpe\\" in the 9-to12-member band that that calls itself Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros. Alex Ebert. the lead singer,  looks like a guy who's just back from an ashram in India: underfed, long hair up in a bun, loose white shirt and pants, and bare feet. The female lead singer is so enthusiastic and awake --- a knockout in a thrift-shop dress, cardigan sweater and running shoes --- that you can't take your eyes off her. \\"A beautiful woman,\\" Proust wrote, \\"is an invitation to a happiness she alone can fulfill.\\" That is Jade Castrinos.<br /><br />I love everything about this crew --- its large cast, its back story, and, most of all, its simple formula for happiness.<br /><br />Okay, so the lyrics are mostly unabashed cornball (\\"Alabama, Arkansas/ I do love my Ma and Pa/ But not as much as I do love you\\"). I love how the song starts with a whistled echo of an Ennio Morricone theme from a Clint Eastwood western. I love the band and its soloists. Most of all, I'm a sucker for the refrain: \\"Home, let me come home/ Home is wherever I'm with you.\\"<br /><br />I have read the reviews, and it's the same deal in every city --- Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros are a traveling Woodstock, a throwback to the great lost days when bands thought of themselves as families and concerts were foaming whirlpools of joy.<br /><br />Who are they? How did they happen? What do they mean?<br /><br />Pass the peace pipe, kids, and I'll tell you a story that may make you  --- depending on your age --- nostalgic or jealous.<br /><br />We start with Alex Ebert, lead singer of a band called Ima Robot. He is cynical and negative, drunk on a daily basis. Desperate to be someone else, he breaks up the band, leaves his girlfriend for a small apartment with a blow-up mattress and joins Alcoholics Anonymous. A year later, Ebert has written many pages about Edward Sharpe, who was \\"sent down to Earth to heal and save mankind --- but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love.\\"<br /><br />Then, in downtown Los Angeles, he meets Jade Castrinos. They \\"hit it off and made a run for freedom.\\" They start writing songs. They acquire a school bus and a band.<br /><br />Want yet another reason to mourn Heath Ledger? He gives the band seed money to record a CD.

I guess thats why EMI did not rerelease it when they did all the '96 remasters.<br /><br />The first cd version in '92 on Dojo records was a vinyl transfer and sounds reasonable. Then in '93 a Canadian company, Griffin, sourced the American vinyl master, which was a copy of a copy, and used that as the basis for their cd. That version sounds better and is the preferred one. The sound is good given the source. There is no 'loudness war' junk (google or wikipedia it if you don't know what it is), so the music is fairly dynamic. The eq suffers though as the bass is very anemic and the top end a little too dominant. But overall, the sound is better than the Dojo version.<br /><br />*****************The Music<br />I think this is their second best release behind 'The Space Ritual'. It is quintessential Hawkwind.<br /><br />It starts with the amazing 'Assault and Battery/The Golden Void'. Great double drumming, Mellotron, synths, flutes, saxes, and great fuzz from Brock and Lemmy. Lemmy's bass played shocked me when I first heard it as I only knew him from the proto-punk noise of Motorhead. I was amazed how creative and innovative his Hawkwind work was. Too bad he was kicked out and started playing just thrash bass.<br /><br />The next track is 'The Wizard Blew His Horn'. Some people don't like Morecock's spoken word contributions, but I quite enjoy them.<br /><br />'Opa-Loka' is an experimental jam.<br /><br />'The Demented Man' is a folk based song that harkens back to their first release, a very good acoustic song.<br /><br />'Magnu' is a driving rocker with an Arabic touch. The violin jamming is the highlight of the song, along with Turner's shadowing on sax.<br /><br />'Standing at the Edge' and 'Warriors' are the other two more Morecock spoken word pieces.<br /><br />In between the above mentioned spoken word pieces is 'Spiral Galaxy 28948' written by Simon House and is an expansive synth based instrumental track.<br /><br />'Dying Seas' ends the album proper with some great riffage complimented by superb violin and sax work. It is only three minutes though, and really needed to be longer to develop properly.<br /><br />On the later cd releases, the bonus tracks 'Kings of Speed' and 'Motorhead' are included. They are great strait ahead rockers. 'Kings of Speed' has a fantastic violin solo and some great guitar by Brock.

B002SJIO4A|3.0|I saw this film in the theater along with my son and my brother.  I expected more and overall I liked it, except for two things. First, the ending as mentioned by others, was so unlike the rest of the film it was jarring.  Suddeny there's this Robocop-like suit and . . . . well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it.  Secondly, not all sci-fi/action film lovers appreciate over-the-top use of profanity.  I started counting the number of times the \\"F-word\\" was used because it started to get so rediculous!  It was like one writer  said, \\"Wait!  I can't think what they would say here!\\" and another writer replied, \\"Oh, just have them say the F-word.\\"  I'd say rent, not buy.
B0002ZXCY4|3.0|While not the best of his career, the music this, Lucassen's third 'Ayreon' album is still top notch. And the storyline is fun, if negligible. However, the narration has got to go. One reading of the liner notes will tell you all you need to know about the story. After that, the narration is simply annoying. But, if you can get past that, an excellent collection!
B002EC3932|5.0|Historicity is the new trio album by the Vijay Iyer trio (Iyer on piano, Stephan Crump on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums.) It is also, in my estimation, the best new jazz release of 2009. The album features 10 tunes and includes covers of such diverse songwriters as Andrew Hill, Stevie Wonder and Julius Hemphill. There are also three originals by Iyer.     The playing on this CD is wonderful - angular, virtuosic, intelligent. This is piano trio music for the 21st century. Just listen for the traces of the beautiful melody in the density of sound that the group achieves on their fantastic cover of Leonard Bernstein's \\"Somewhere.\\" The Hill number \\"Smokestack\\" is nearly as brilliant. I listen to dozens of jazz trio albums each year and while many (if not most) are enjoyable and musically competent, very few really having something new to say. Vijay Iyer's Historicity is one of those albums. Listen and hear for yourself.
B00168OIOE|4.0|I do not need to say how good is this movie, because if you do not yet know it, then is simply because you have not seen it. However the reason I am taking off a star is because one more time Disney has published the DVD version without Spanish track, which is annoying considering that the B-Ray version includes it and if you want a DVD copy is because you wan the possibility to watch the same movie in those places where you do not have BR-player available.
B000DWMN2S|4.0|A delightful film, full of suprising twists and turns. not at all your typical Hollywood production told in a typical way by the usual Hollywood actors. Elijah Wood's character is presumably the protagonist of the story focused on his attempts to discover his Jewish roots and to thank the woman who helped his grandfather escape the Holocast in the Ukraine. Hutz and Leskin are local tour guides hired to help him in his quest. But while everything will eventually be illuminated not everything is so simple and straightforward. In the end, Wood serves more to guide the other two on their voyage. Wood is definitely fun to watch but the show really belongs to the other two and their dog, Sammy Davis Jr, Jr. Not to mention a caste of extras that don't seem to acting so much as going through their own lives. Like life itself, it's full of comic aspects, but capable of turning deadly serious at any given corner, without warning. there is time for both beauty and horror, sometimes simultaneously.
B002LW9ITY|5.0|This Cars movie version is so nice, with the two cars that it includes, which by the way were not in my son's collection. The only thing is that I would like it to have Spanish track (Disney does this very often), however that is my mistake because I did not read carefully the specs. Other than that, Cars is just lovely for children.

No it's nothing like the theater version of 3D that I agree, but this is tv folks and by the way, at it's best. If you were honest on your own review than you do know that when you purchased this 3D version it came with a 2d version as well. I never once heard those people mention that in there reviews. Hmm makes me wonder if they ever purchased the Blu ray version..I ejoyed it in 3D as well. It is what it is. A great movie in 3D and in 2DIf your not happy with the 3D, than plop in the disc 2 and watch it in 2D, it's just that simple folks! Watch it and become a kid again!
B002JCSWUW|5.0|....though it is NOT a biography of Nelson Mandela, and it is not a sports movie about winning the game against all odds. If you can step outside those possibilities it is a wonderful study in leadership style and method that prevented a newly unified South Africa decending into the sort of mess that Rhodesia/Zimbabwe did.    As South African friends of mine confirmed - Morgan Freeman IS Nelson Mandela and Matt Damon is Francois Pinaud with an impeccable accent.    The film portrays a wonderful moment in history when a Rainbow Nation rose and displayed the best side of Truth and Reconciliation to the world
B000ZELISO|5.0|This movie is great.  Some may disagree but if you liked the first of the series then you will enjoy this film.  Beware of young children in this film as it can be frightening to some.  I learned that the hard way with my three year.  For the price... the lowest price i have seen.  Wal mart had this film for $24.99 for just the DVD.

B001TWT0AE|5.0|John Ford and John Wayne, after building a career glorifying the Old West, hereupon set about to dismantle the myths and legends, in a deeply symbolic send-off shot in black-and-white in a small, violent frontier town.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays an Easterner young lawyer, who comes to Shinbone with a strong belief in the rule of law.  Unfortunately, he is the only one in town with this belief.  He seeks to improve the lives of the townsfolk, providing reading lessons, setting up the framework for a democracy, and even teaching civics and government.<br /><br />Lee Marvin and John Wayne, both of whom embody the lawless, violent old ways of the West, are old enemies who share mutual respect for each other, even as Marvin is a sadistic killer and Wayne a tough frontiersman who has built a life for himself.<br /><br />Land wars and territorial battles form the backdrop, but the film is really about how Marvin and Wayne are increasingly anachronistic in a changing West where violence gives way to law and civilization.<br /><br />Wayne recognizes this, and ultimately sacrifices himself and his love for a good woman to Stewart, who Wayne rightly sees as representing the future.<br /><br />One significant scene that clearly resonated with the civil rights struggles of the times involves Wayne's assistant, played by college and NFL great Woody Strode, who forgets the \\"all men are created equal\\" part of Declaration of Independence, at which point Stewart as his teacher notes that it's ok because lots of other people have forgotten that part too.<br /><br />Classic.
B001I5M9SC|5.0|Es un concierto que realmente le llega a uno desde el punto de vista musical y visual de una manera impresionante.  Todo muy cuidado y uno se queda con ganas de escuchar más temas.  Sin lugar a dudas cuando sucede eso, significa que es muy bueno.  Lo único que me faltó fue alguna canción más con Laura Pausini.  Igualmente es un muy buen concierto.  Recomendable!!!!
1439102813|5.0|Alice was in that funky stage of life many middle-aged women encounter.  Many who are in or have passed that stage often remember their mothers saying, \\"If your head wasn't screwed on, you'd lose it.\\"  She was misplacing or losing things constantly.  Her Blackberry was always hiding and showing up in odd places.  Her words began to elude her.  Even more disturbing when she was on her daily run in Cambridge she found herself in Harvard square, \\"but didn't know which way was home.\\"  Dr. Alice Howland, distinguished Harvard professor of psychology at Harvard, was starting to come unglued and decided to visit her doctor, who quickly chalked everything up to Menopause.  Maybe it was just that or maybe it was something more.<br /><br />Her sense that something was wrong was increasing by the day.  Her husband John found the Blackberry in the freezer.  Her children became agitated when she stopped connecting with them in a meaningful way.  Her beloved students most likely thought she was getting daffy.  \\"Can someone please tell me what it says on your syllabus for today?\\"  It was something more.  It was insidious.  It was terrifying.  It was the early onset of Alzheimer's.  Lisa Genova, author and actor, has penned a stupendously riveting tale of Alice and her loved ones struggle with Alzheimer's in Still Alice.<br /><br />Alice's sister Anne and her mother had tragically died in an accident many years ago.  She was asking her daughter Lydia where Anna, her other daughter was.  No, she wanted to know about Anne, her sister.  Lydia reminded her of when and how her sister and mother  had died.  Alice went into shock at the \\"new\\" revelation.  She had no sense of time, no memory.  The shock literally \\"filled her pounding heart with rage and grief.  She began to shake and cry.\\"  Lydia told her father that Alice really thought they'd just died.  Something was wrong, terribly wrong, but what was it?<br /><br />This was one of the most powerful and stunning novels many of us will read in some time to come.  It was not that it had any original or new take on a plot, but rather that it was so well written and brought the devastating disease of Alzheimer's, a topic close to the hearts of many, right up front in our faces with a big bang.  Lisa Genova's poignant and downright scary story of Alice is, to be quite trite, a must read.  The price of this paperback is high, but a large portion of the profit from the sale will go to the Alzheimer's Association.  I haven't read anything this heartbreaking since I read Clinton Erb's nonfiction portrayal of his wife in Losing Lou-Ann.

B001PO53IO|5.0|The clone wars takes place between Star Wars: Episode 2, and Episode 3.<br /><br />It does a pretty good job of taking place right after the Clone Wars movie, with Anakin having a padawan.  They go on missions, fight bad guys, rescue troopers, all the fun Star Wars stuff.<br /><br />The Picture Quality on Blu-ray is amazing.  The colors are vibrant, and the lightsabers look just plain great.<br /><br />The Sound Quality is also very good.  All the classic Star Wars sounds are there, and the voice actors (although many aren't the same as the Star Wars Trilogy) still do an excellent job with their characters.
B000TEPLFQ|5.0|That in and of itself blows my mind. I don't need to go in depth about the style and impact of this music, but I will say that I am still waiting for someone to top it... but I'm not holding my breath. If you are too young to have heard this one the first time around, pick it up. Cuts like Unfinished Sympathy, Daydreaming, and Safe From Harm helped to create and define trip-hop. The album takes some unexpected turns, unlike later Massive albums that tend to maintain one sound throughout an album. That's not a bad thing. When I first got the album, I wanted it for the grooves for dance class and the gym, so I skipped a a few tracks that didn't fit that vibe for me. I don't skip them anymore. It's that kind of album. Put it on a good pair of headphones, lean back, and enjoy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After all the hype it would have been all too predictable to have a a one track (IDAD) album rushed out. All credit to Mr Cowell, this is aything but. Wonderful interpretations of a wide range of genre.

B0002O06NA|4.0|To pick a favorite Black Keys album, for me, is a hard thing to do. All of their albums are great in their own respect. But this is probably the one i would recommend for the first time buyer. It starts out with the bluesy, droaning \\"When the lights go out\\", then ramps it up with one of their live staples, the high energy \\"10 am automatic\\". \\"Just couldn't tie me down\\", with it's head boppin', hand clapping rhythm, follows. \\"All hands against his own\\" is a nice tune with allot of spunk. \\"The desperate man\\",has a funky upbeat tempo to counter it's beat down lyrics (summer's here but still in fall, wonder what she done me for). One of my favorite Keys tunes, \\"Girl is on my mind\\",is next. \\"The Lengths\\", a nice ballad, mellows it down a bit, but only to have \\"Grown so ugly\\" bring it all back up to speed (baby this ain't me, baby this ain't me, grown so ugly). Then, the climax of the album, \\"Stack shot Billy\\" comes around turn three like a bat out of hell with it's murderous message and fuzz-wahh blend(45 pistol is Stack's right hand, sent him away to the promised land). \\"Act nice and gentle\\", a Kinks tune, follows (interestingly enough). \\"Aeroplane blues\\" is the rawest of the lot, the most to the core of the Keys sound. \\"Keep me\\" drops in like a meteor out of the heavens (keep me clean, keep me warm, keep my soul away from harm). \\"Till i get my way\\" closes the album quite nice, to the point the first instinct is to run out and buy the rest of the Black Keys catalog, which is what you should do! This is by far the best band around, don't miss the bus!
B00129H7VS|5.0|This is a great mini-series that really brings an honest look to the true stories of our troops in the 101st Airborne.  Everything about this series is done with integrity and shows much of the great commeraderie and strength, the personalities and personal thoughts of the troops, as well as some of the more difficult sides of war and ultimately our part in the victory of WWII from the soldiers' persective.  Each episode begins with a documentary style shot of one of the real veterans who are the \\"characters\\" in the film and it adds that necessary reminder that \\"this is real, this really happened\\" element that we sometimes forget when watching these kinds of documentaries/movies.  It is also very compelling, entertaining, comical, heart-touching and realistic.  I've seen it on DVD and Blu-ray disc and the Blu-ray is just as good as it always is.  If you have a Blu-ray player, invest in Band of Brothers.
0143116177|3.0|This isn't a great book, but it's not exactly bad either. Ferguson takes the reader through some interesting events and explains things with clarity. I disagreed with Ferguson on many theoretical issues, but this is after all just a book on history, so that's what you should expect.    At 10 bucks this isn't a bad buy, so if you aren't already familiar with the events that Ferguson deals with, this can be enjoyable. Just don't expect too much depth in analysis. I personally haven't read any similar books, so I don't know what to compare this with, but I expect that there's something better out there than this.    I guess mediocre is the word I'm looking for. It has its moments(I guess I'd give it 3,5 stars if I could).
1416594892|1.0|Beautifully written ... until the Cowboy rides in. Suddenly, on the last couple of pages, the big bad mean nasty rambunctious zealous Americans show up and destroy everything good in the world. HOGWASH! After a novel filled with reminders of the brutality of the Russians in Chechnya, the Germans in Warsaw, the Arabs with their brothers and lovers, and the assorted perversions of European and Mid Eastern culture, a group of American spies appear from outside the plot and overturn the namby pamby actions of half hearted Germans spying on their own country. The most wanted man is a young victim of misinformation and distortions done by non-Americans. The Swiss and Germans have no grace in their laws. The really bad guy in the plot is a sponsor of terrorists. But Le Carre', for purely liberal establishment reasons, enters a couple of spies on horseback as the last act. With what many would like to criticize as typical American cursing and judgementalism and bravado (which in truth is a charicature and misrepresentation of Americans) the really bad guy is swept to justice in the Mid East, and the Chechen is returned to Chechnya by order of Interpol. Le Carre' ends a relatively decent plot, with great characters, by tossing in two pages of claptrap that destroy the novel. DON'T BOTHER READING IT; but if you must, buy it used or check it out of a library.

B000ZELISO|4.0|1st of all, I'm a fan of this movie (and the whole series), I think the director and the cast did a fantastic job making the film. I also like the bonus features of this BD, it's so much better than those of other titles. But I think I'm not satisfied with the Image Quality of this BD: the image seems a bit fuzzy and foggy, it's just not as clear as other BD titles (for example, Startrek, G.I.Joe...), the average bit rate of Paramount 09 BD is over 30MB/sec, but this Harry Potter BD is only about 20MB/Sec (the Dark Knight is about the same bit rate, but the Image Quality is still much better), I really love this film, so that's why I'm expecting more from Warner Brothers. My conspiracy theory is that they did this intentionally, so that fans would be forced to buy their 2nd release (such like \\"ultimate version\\"...) for a better image quality... sorry, might be a bit drama queen here, but I'm really not satisfied with the image quality.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm old enough to remember watching the original series before there was anything else Star Trek. And while I at least have respect and reverence for the old series and actors, I can nevertheless proclaim that this movie is an absolutely outstanding new interpretation of Star Trek for the 2000's. Maybe I was in the perfect mood and frame of mind when I watched this movie, but I loved it. It was action packed. It was stylistic in a fresh (like I've never seen that before) kind of way. It looked outstanding on my widescreen TV! For me, the reinvention of the old characters didn't seem forced or campy. It wasn't over the top ridiculous as many actions movies are these days. The plot was interesting and engaging. Overall, 5 STARS!!! The most entertaining Star Trek movie ever! I can't wait for a sequel.
B002SZXSL8|5.0|How does this group continue to stay under the radar? They have a sound like old school AC/DC. I can't get enough of them, and this is their sophomore album and is just as good as their first, if not better. Pick this album up now if you're ready to have your ears thank you.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I remember thinking that season 1 of Lost was the most interesting, most entertaining and most innovative single season of television I had ever watched. While it still ranks at the very top of my list, I have to say that season 5 of Lost (particularly after a second viewing) at least approaches a similar level of overall viewing satisfaction. Mystery of the island aside, this show is really about the characters. And after this watching this season, I feel that things have really fell into place in regard to the character development. After five seasons, you have a pretty good sense of who these characters are, you feel like you've known them for a while. So when Sawyer enter's his \\"happy\\" stage this season, you really feel good for the guy. You laugh at Hurley because you know who he is by now. You empathize with Locke as he tries to figure out and/or deal with how and why he is so special. You understand Sayid's pain and (IMO loneliness) because of his background. And of course, you second guess and question the motives behind anything that Ben does. The story in season 5 uses everything you know and feel about these characters and begins to set up for the final conclusion. Lost is an excellent show. In the end, it may be the defining television show of this era.<br /><br />The only negative things I can say about Lost (and they are minor) are 1) by now, the Dharma Iniitiave has lost nearly all of its mysteriousness and 2) there appear to be some contradictions as to how difficult it is to get back and forth from the island.

B000053GTK|5.0|Gentle Giant were smart: they were able to ride the line of making music accessable enough to be a mainline prog band--like Yes or King Crimson, but they had the rigour of a Hatfield or National Health.<br /><br />From A Glass House is their most accomplished album. They actually lower the volume and trim the big guitar lines of their eariler work.<br />They use a lot more percussion here, maramba, bells, and chimes.<br /><br />This is a study in obtuse rhythms. Everything is scored to the last note, and the band works in both unison and counter ryhthms. It is complex, but not cerebral. Subtle, but impressive. You can get into the complications, absorbing them without disecting.  You appreciate, instinctively, this music that changes the reflexes of what is expected.<br /><br />Amazing album

B000063Y8F|3.0|Certainly you will fall in love with it when you first use it, but after a year mine has become dysfunctional.  As with cheaper models, after moderate use the handles of the press begin to hit each other before the clove is fully squeezed.  So mine is now a garlic flattener, because that's about all it does.      It pains me to have to shop again for a garlic press after buying such a highly praised one and I'm hoping that the Kuhn Rikon model will be good enough to be the last one I have to purchase.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Watched these in one weekend, with my then boyfreind now husband 7 years ago!  It was the most eye opening best mini series ever!!Most realistic to show the real true face of war, and what these men suffered, at the cost of everyones freedom, and many many lives.  I just wanted to say thank you to all VETERANS!!!  Be prepared to cry for these men, and to root them on, you will fall in love with this story!!  We have watched the whole thing more than 15 times!!  I love it!!  Everyone we tell about this, series wants to borrwow our set!
B002RSDW80|4.0|The reviews already posted convey the basic plot so rather than repeat the same points I'll skip to what I enjoyed about the film. The two stories nicely blend together and although I was drawn to the Meryl Streep/Stanley Tucci side of the movie, often almost groaning aloud when switching back to the Amy Adams/Chris Messina pairing, somewhere around the mid-point I stopped wrestling with which side was more absorbing and just started enjoying the ebb and flow of the two stories.<br /><br />I think this is Nora Ephron's most skilful and graceful directing, to date. And, the end result shows her maturity and talent for storytelling, and knowing what the audience wants to see -- something often devalued as irrelevant in the quest for artistic expression or big box office tallies.<br /><br />My knowledge of Julia Child is limited to her wonderful television cooking series and the cookbook which is the subject of this movie. How delightful to learn that she had a very loving marriage and quite an interesting life. In that regard, the movie was a revelation and sparked an interest to learn more about Child.  The story of Julie and her husband, although less engrossing was still entertaining, and both actors held their own remarkably well against the superb veterans Streep and Tucci.  It is also a pleasure to have two male characters portray loving supportive husbands rather than cads, womanizers, selfish stupid oafs or brutes.  These men had backbone, and heart.<br /><br />I disagree with the criticism that Streep is doing a cartoonish impression of Julia Child. For someone who has watched almost every episode of Child's cooking show, her voice and mannerisms were cartoonish - that's the reality.  If Streep had not attempted to replicate her very distinct cadence and gestures the audience would have felt something essential was missing. While watching Streep's performance in Julie and Julia, I forgot about the actress and focused on the character she was playing. For me that is an indication that Streep succeeded in her portrayal. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film.at Streep succeeded in her portrayal. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film.
B001EOOQEM|5.0|After Ozzy Ozborn left Black Sabbath, they dropped the keyboads and big arrangements they had experimented with on Sabatage and Technical Ecctacy.<br /><br />Heaven and Hell returns them to the basic heavy metel they started with, almost; when this came out in 1980, metel was less about the blues sludge Sabbath had began with ten years before. Rock was more streemlined, a much different beast than the 1960s underground they walked into when they signed to Vertigo in 1969.<br /><br />But that works in Heaven and Hell's favor. \\"Neon Nights\\" opens the album. Sabbath arrive lean and mean and are ready to rock. \\"Children Of The Sea\\" continues in this vein. But this is no dumb thumper band. Listen to Butler's fluid bass, on the whole album.<br /><br />People always classifiy Sabbath as rock goons. But if you listen to the playing on the taunt songs here, you'll find out--the conventional wisdom is wrong. These guys are great musicians.<br /><br />Ronnie James Dio is a different type of singer than Osborn. He uses theatrics as did Ozzy, but with Dio, it is more an act of a showman. You don't get the feeling that he is doing an exagerated version of his life as you did with Osborn. Dio is a metel singer doing metel moves. Listen to \\"Lady Evil\\"; typical metel lyrics about a lady \\"just south of witches valley,\\" but Dio just tears right trough the song. He has the confidence of a hard rock master, not the anguish of the masked Ozzy.<br /><br />But his voice is heavier, and more up front in the mix, and this changes Sabbath's music--they are working as a hard rock unit with a great pipeman rather than a band of burnouts recording their autobiography<br /><br />Great album.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|For those of your who waited to get the DVDs for Star Wars - These 3 packs will be worth the wait. Great price and updated content.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Black Sabbath were not a prog band--ironic since they were one of the first signed to Vertigo--but when they began to add heavier arrangements to their albums, it worked well.<br /><br />This happened on Sabatage. There is plenty of out and out old style Sabbath riff--thomp here, \\"Hole In The Sky,\\" but the band uses a lot more layering and different instruments.<br /><br />Listen to the harpsichord on \\"Am I Going Insane.\\" It is a completely un-Sabbath thing to do, but it works well. So do the chiors, heavier tracked guitars, and accustic interludes that bridge the tracks.<br /><br />There is a slight 70s chease element to Sabatage, but in this case, that only adds to the fun. Sabbath had such a sense of humor about themselves, even the few times today they sound dated, you still have love it.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|Hey all, just thought I'd add my 2 cents here. The adjustability of the joystick is a very nice feature. Out of the box it was too tall and the HAT control was too far back. I adjusted both using a small tool that comes attached to the joystick base in about 1 minute. I was initially worried about the 4 buttons on the 'head' of the joystick being too close to the HAT switch. When I actually used it I found hitting the correct button was very easy and my thumb never accidently hit the 'fire rockets' button instead of the \\"look left\\". I read reviews stating there was a need for a 4th leg on the base in front however, I've never noticed an issue. However, I'm more of a finesse guy so I'm not ripping the joystick off the desk every 2 minutes.<br /><br />Setup was easy and my version of windows found the latest drivers with no problems. I've only used it for about 1.5 months so far and everything seems great and I've had no issues. If I remember, I'll come back on here to write a follow up about it's durability.
B0009UC7QQ|4.0|This film by Peter Weir (Gallipoli, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Dead Poets Society) has some themes in common with 'Dark City' (by another Australian director, Alex Proyas) as well as the British sixties TV show 'The Prisoner', although it doesn't go into as much philosophical depth as either of those. It's still a worthwhile film, however.<br /><br />'The Truman Show' is clever in the way it gradually reveals the artificial nature of central character Truman's world. Jim Carey performs well as Truman - an actor people love or hate, but he suits the role admirably here, despite not being able to resist breaking out into his trademark exaggerated flourishes. Weir is a director who knows how to play the viewer's emotions, and the pathos of activists trying to tell Truman his life is a charade is beautiful. Truman's producers believe they can 'handle' him, but his spirit breaks out regardless in the end - a lesson to would-be totalitarians everywhere.
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief is an excellent book. I read the book in a week and I just didn't want to stop reading. The story is well executed and written. I read this book for a book club I just joined and was thrilled to finally have the chance to buy the book and read it.<br /><br />As I read the story I found myself getting more and more drawn into the characters and their interactions with everything going on around them. The story is about a girl named Liesel who steals a book and discovers the power of the written word. I was drawn to the fact that she did not know how to read very well at first and yet she was very eager to learn.<br /><br />The setting takes place in Germany during Hitler's reign. A young girl of 12 years is given to a foster home because her mother can not take care of her anymore. On the way to the new foster home her brother dies on the train and sets the stage for her to steal her first book. At first Liesel isn't happy about moving to a new home and having new parents. The Hubbermann's are her mama and papa. Mrs. Hubbermann is a very unique character and I actually started to like her as I read the book. Mr. Hubbermann is a fantastic papa to Liesel. All three have a wonderful relationship that changes and grows throughout the book.<br /><br />I found myself crying as I read the last part of the book. When I was reading the book I knew I would shed a tear or two, I shed more then that. I had tears of sorrow and joy as I read The Book Thief. I highly recommend The Book Thief and encourage you to pick up a copy and take the time to read the story.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I'm a gamer, not the most hardcore but I can see it from here.  I have a real job that I work hard at and when I get the time to game after work or on the weekend I want the experience to be as plug and play as the computer will allow (consoles are for children).  To that end I keep my hardware all up to date and all my graphics settings maxed.  I play RTS FPS and RPG mostly with a little bit of MMO mixed in.  The G15 has been my keyboard of choice since I picked one up a year ago and the software seems to finally be catching up to it's potential.  Then last month this little guy came into the mix.    The G13 is pretty sweet, the software utility that runs the G15 runs this one too and it's reasonable with the system resources. The profile utility has little trouble detecting most games and loading up the appropriate configuration.  I spent a half a day getting all the profiles set up for the G13 and G15 and am not sorry I did it.  When everything is tuned in and tested the pair of them make for a good time in any game genre.    The joystick being the most used feature, some quibble over it's reluctance to be pushed and used as a button.  I say this is a good thing, I'm a little heavy handed and would rather push a button twice intentionaly than once accidentaly.  I refer the naysayers to a worn out Playstation controller or the infamous windows button sitting between your ctrl and alt keys, experiencing either of these frustrations will surely find you in agreement.    Finally, the reason this is a four star instead of a five star product.  The \\"gamepanel\\" LCD screen doesn't look the same as the identical unit on the G15.  The backlight was a great idea and being able to turn it on and off is cool enough but come on Logitech.  Anybody that buys this thing is gonna set it next to their G15 keyboard and sexy G9 mouse just like I do and be disappointed that the two LCD screen with all their great functions and programs don't match.  This one would seem like a no brainer from a design stand point but I'm sure they had their reasons.  Nonetheless, I have played with the adjustable color scheme (very cool btw) and have had no luck getting it to match the G15's display.  All in all, good little gaming device.
1582701709|4.0|The Secret was recommended to me by a friend on Facebook because of something very difficult I am going through. He just kept going on how the book changed his life and that how what you are thinking and feeling is what will happen. I went into reading the book with skepticism. The basis of the book is the Secret to living a wonderful life and being able to receive everything you want and deserve.<br /><br />As I was reading the book I noticed how my emotions were influencing the things around me. I started to tune into my feelings and try to think positive thoughts. I noticed myself starting to feel better and getting happier as I read the book. I know that I will use this book as a reference when ever I feel negative feelings or thoughts. I am not going to try and persuade anyone that this book is the meaning to life. I will tell you that The Secret is a great book to help you find the real you and to discover the positive energy from with in you. So I would recommend reading The Secret for some great soul searching and healing.
B0026JWDQW|5.0|We only recently got turned on to Paulo through the Graham Norton show.  This is a wonderful CD.  I love the way he takes old songs and makes them his own, like \\"Worried Man\\".  Having lived in England thirty years ago, \\"Simple Things\\" takes me right back there.
B002JCSWUW|5.0|It sure is a unique movie about nation building. I thought Clint Eastwood captured the spirit of what happened during that World Cup perfectly. The All Blacks were more fearsome and the game far more intense than what is portrayed in the movie. But the intensity of the people, that was wonderful.    It is a very beautiful movie, made with a lot of love and care.
B0008ENIAC|5.0|I really love this movie and Amazon makes everything so easy to buy!  Everything comes to me!! I don't have to go to the store, and I love that.    If you love old movies this one is one of the best!!
B0009UC810|5.0|The Blues Brothers is a wonderful film about two brothers from a Church orphanage located in Chicago. They grow up to become not quite so gentlemanly. Even so they have good hearts. \\"Joliet\\" Jake Blues is released from prison and picked up by his brother El Wood Blues. They go \\"on a mission from God\\" to save the church where they were raised. How do they do this? They put the band back together. The movie climaxes to a performance that makes enough money to save the church, however it is at the cost of Jake and El Wood being chased by the police and other people for the majority of the movie. The movie concludes with the whole band playing in jail, right where the movie started. It is a feel good, musical movie that the whole family can enjoy. I highly recommend this movie for all people of all ages. It is a wonderful time to sit back and relax.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Our granddaughter requested this DVD movie for Christmas.  Even though the movie is over 40 years old it is a classic story that young people can relate to and enjoy.  The music, Julie Andrews, and the children is a delight for all ages.

B000A61RO2|4.0|Orginally, I bought this CD for one song, \\"Santa Maria [Del Buen Ayre]. This song was used in the movie, \\"Shall We Dance, \\" with Richard Gerr, and Jennifer Lopez. The two of them danced the tango to this. WOW. Since I purchased the CD the rest of the music has grown on me, and I love it.
B000CSOGSC|2.0|MAX MAX (Australia-1979) is a fine action movie. This videotape however is NOT recommended.<br /><br />VIDEO TREASURES dubbed their VHS's at speeds slower than SP (usually LP). Thus, video quality is somewhat degraded. Audio tracks are linear, not HiFi, which also limits fidelity.<br /><br />Seek out MAD MAX on a reliable studio release!
B002RSDW80|4.0|Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are the main reason to see JULIE AND JULIA.  Streep captures the ebullient eccentricity of Julia Child while Tucci beautifully underplays her husband Paul.  The JULIA part is much stronger than the Julie section.  Ireally like Amy Adams and she's fine in her performance...I just don't like Julie...she's self-serving, self-pitying and whiny.  The movie is based on her book ... notice how she even gives herself top billing.<br />Meryl's long overdue another Oscar..is this her year???
0307460444|5.0|What's more to say??  YUM!  I have made several of the recipes so far and am excited to keep trying them.  My favorite so far is the corn meal blackberry.  I'm generally a cheapskate and don't like to purchase cookbooks when there's so many recipes online and in old books that I have, but this was really well worth the minimal investment!  Happy Baking!
B001NESPHC|5.0|OK, if you still need convincing ... This is turning out to be one of my all time favourite albums. I have listened to it countless times and it always remains achingly poingnant, exquisitely sentimental and deeply moving. I loved and still love [[ASIN:B000WTNCYA Worrisome Heart]] and wondered how Melody Gardot could possibly get better than on that album, but this album goes deeper, is more intimate and personal. There are almost no distracting backing vocalists (except on the manificently sassy blues number 'Who will comfort me'), just Melody's smoky cool voice and thoughtful and sensitive instrumental accompaniment. Favourite tracks for me are Baby I'm a Fool, Lover Undercover and Our Love is Easy, but it's all good from start to finish. I can't wait for Ms Gardot's next album, sure to be another stunner!
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|J record has decided to end the year with Alicia's album. A good move in my books since the labels other leading ladies(Whitney & Leona) had lackluster albums. Alicia's Element of Freedom should have be aptly titled Elements of Love. You'll love this album for either the music, lyrics or Alicia singing. In my case I love all the above. I have listened to this album consecutively without skipping a song, although I've repeated a few of them. Most of the songs here are amazing and the ones that are not amazing are really good. The intro being 12 seconds is also a plus and I don't have to skip it.    When I read that Beyonce was going to be featured I winced a little bit. I'm not the biggest Beyonce fan so I wasn't sure about putting her and Alicia in a song. Wow was I wrong, Put It In A Love Song is one amazing song and I think it should be the next single. This song is a toned down \\"Single Ladies\\" by Beyonce, so you get the to shake to it while you take in Alicia on the piano. Beyonce didn't overpower Alicia and Alicia matched Beyonce on the intensity of the song. This Bed is the other up beat song on this album and the only unfortunate thing is that it comes after the big duet. You'll find yourself repeating Put It In A Love Song a few times before giving This Bed a chance which makes it an average song.     The one thing I like about this album is that every single song has its own feel to it. Individually each song has its own tone, style and you feel like a different story is being told. I almost felt like Alicia was giving me a private concert by singing to only me. Alicia also finds a way to balance the piano and the rest of instruments which is different from her previous albums. Is it only me or does her version of Empire State of Mind sound like the original? I was afraid that this would sound the same as Jay Z version minus the rap. It turns out she changed the music and instrumentation and made it better.    My favorite songs on this album are How It FeelsTo Fly, Distance and Time, Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart & That's How Strong My Love Is. Again these are just my favorite otherwise none of the songs on this album deserve to be skipped. I really cannot wait for the concert as I think this would be the most intimate concert Alicia will ever put together. This is a 5 star album and Alicia will cruise to the top of the charts and collect more awards.
1439144907|1.0|Beautifully written ... until the Cowboy rides in. Suddenly, on the last couple of pages, the big bad mean nasty rambunctious zealous Americans show up and destroy everything good in the world. HOGWASH! After a novel filled with reminders of the brutality of the Russians in Chechnya, the Germans in Warsaw, the Arabs with their brothers and lovers, and the assorted perversions of European and Mid Eastern culture, a group of American spies appear from outside the plot and overturn the namby pamby actions of half hearted Germans spying on their own country. The most wanted man is a young victim of misinformation and distortions done by non-Americans. The Swiss and Germans have no grace in their laws. The really bad guy in the plot is a sponsor of terrorists. But Le Carre', for purely liberal establishment reasons, enters a couple of spies on horseback as the last act. With what many would like to criticize as typical American cursing and judgementalism and bravado (which in truth is a charicature and misrepresentation of Americans) the really bad guy is swept to justice in the Mid East, and the Chechen is returned to Chechnya by order of Interpol. Le Carre' ends a relatively decent plot, with great characters, by tossing in two pages of claptrap that destroy the novel. DON'T BOTHER READING IT; but if you must, buy it used or check it out of a library.
0316044695|5.0|My first review and I'm compelled to inform you that is a great book. The book details the accounts of our military heroes and keeps you on edge and wanting to read more. I'm proud to recommend this book and especially proud of my fellow servicemen.

B0026P3G12|5.0|From E-mails sent to me by other persons, I learned about Susan Boyle, and I liked her from the very start. She was, and is, a great singer from the start. Her first CD all but confirms that. All the songs are well sung and have great meaning. About one song - \\"How great thou art\\" - she could have sung the stanzas, too. I also noticed that the last song is \\"Silent Night\\", a Christmas song. So O. K., I will be playing that CD throughout the year, and will hear a Christmas song during non-Christmas time. And whether or not Susan intended that, she promoted the idea that Jesus Christ came down to earth to stay amongst us at all times. Congratulations, Susan - you've done a great job in promoting a great idea!
B002N1AERI|5.0|I have been into this type of metal music for some time now but it wasn't until recently that I wanted to really check out this Epica band I kept hearing about. Truthfully I didn't really give them a chance because I already listened to Nightwish (among others) &  figured \\"if you've heard one then you've heard them all.\\" In some cases the previous statement is true but with Epica & their newest CD 'Design Your Universe' I would say \\"NO!\\" This CD is PERFECT from beginning to end....fast songs, slower stuff, great heavy riffs & melodies, powerful, doomy, etc! Seriously, this album is brilliant..I have played it AD NAUSEUM, that's how GREAT it is! Symphonic metal fans don't miss out on this one...if Epica has become this good with this album I CAN'T WAIT to see what they will come up with next!
1401323820|4.0|Detective Nikki Heat more than lives up to her name with her intense passion for justice and her stifling dedication to bringing down New York City's not so finest.  When a real estate mogul is found plastered on the concrete below his apartment, Heat and her team are called in to solve the case. Lies and secrets lie around every corner of the investigation, and Nikki must balance her police work with her new task from the mayor. Big time reporter Jameson Rook has been assigned to her squad for research on an article about the police. As much as Heat is annoyed by the arrangement, she can't help but admit there are sparks evident between her and Rook. As the case intensifies, so do Nikki's emotions, culminating in a heat wave she never saw coming.     For those who may not know, Richard Castle is a fictional character (brilliantly played by Nathan Fillion) from the ABC television hit, Castle. Heat Wave is written to be a fun companion to the witty cop/comedy/romance/drama, and that's exactly what you get here. In the first season of the show, novelist Richard Castle is assigned to NYPD Detective Kate Beckett to research his next novel. As their relationship progresses (mostly platonic with romantic hints), Castle decides to start a new series of novels about a sexy, tough as nails detective named Nikki Heat (which is obviously inspired by Kate Beckett). You can imagine the excitement that brewed amongst the fandom when ABC/Hyperion treated us with the very novel we heard so much about on the TV show.     I was a bit hesitant going into Heat Wave because I expected it to be completely over the top and gimmicky. While there certainly are elements of this story that fall into those categories, I was pleasantly surprised to find a novel that is actually readable and entertaining.  This is certainly not the year's greatest detective story, nor is it meant to be. It's written primarily for the fans of TV show, and I'm not sure someone who's never watched Castle could actually appreciate the inside jokes and subtle humor that run rampant throughout the story.     This novel does have a decent mystery angle, but make no mistake about it. This story is all about Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook. The sparks fly all throughout this tale, even overtly so in an overemphasized love scene that was really unnecessary. Fans of the show should be warned that some of the language and themes in Heat Wave are considerably more mature than what network TV currently allows.     As a fan of Castle, I enjoyed this book for what it was and I'm anxious to see if we're treated to more Richard Castle novels in the future. If you've not watched the show, do yourself a favor and rent Season One on DVD before you read this book. Not only will you have picked up a great new TV show, but you'll fully be able to appreciate the gist of this story.

0978053583|4.0|I think Haanel's work trumps Wattles work. The eloquent language and the beautiful prose of this book makes you feel romantically enraptured with the concepts of meditation and visualization in a way no other author has. This book is older so you may find it more of a laborious read than some of the books of late, but if you want to really master practices like employing law of attraction to create your life and visualization to attract what you desire you have to learn meditation - that's just a fact.<br /><br />Haanel talks about the \\"sun center\\" - which is the solar plexus in other words, and he explains the power of Light and how to quiet your mind. These concepts and practices are a must if you want mastery - if you want to be a successful law of attraction practitioner.<br /><br />This is the quintessential \\"how to\\" for all life mastery practices.

It will help you see that you will not succeed if you are doing the day to day work because you can't take the time to grow the business. The business will only be as big as the one person trying to do it all. I'm looking to expand my business and now I know what I need to do. I need to bring in experts who know the business and let them run with my vision. But I'll still need to keep an eye on the business.

B002XHN776|5.0|This is the BEST album I have heard in at least 10 years... I never write reviews, really ever.. But, this album is the best I've heard in a long time, and I can't stop playing it! Every song on here feels epic, if that's an alright word to use.  I was impressed with their other music, but this just pushed it over the edge. Jared Leto's voice is AMAZING and blends perfectly with his style of music. I have never heard better from any band before. AMAZING!!!!!!!!!! Every artist should take lessons from him... W O W! I would pay 100 dollars for this album if it costs that much hahaha, seriously!
0375842209|5.0|Liesel Meminger's life is flipped topsy-turvy after seeing brother die while they journey to meet their new foster parents. Her love of books and reading grows out of an initial theft carried out at her brother's funeral. It is with this that the lovely story of the Book Thief begins. With keen reluctance, Liesel enters the quiet burg, Molching. Not knowing what to expect from her adoptive parents, the Hubermann's. What she ultimately finds are her loving foster parents Hans, an accordion playing painter, and Rosa, a strict but fair mother.  Her real stories are to be had in company of a boy named Rudy with whom she shares many adventures like stealing fruit and other food during the wars hard times. Her hunger for the written word also sees her thievery extend to the Mayor's library, aided by the willing Rudy. Seeing her relationships with Rudy and her foster father blossom is the best part of the book. Hans takes it upon himself to teach Liesel to read and write during the oppressive times of Nazi rule.  Markus Zusak does a fantastic job of painting the horrors and injustices of war and narrowing their focus to the daily lives of the people Molching's people. Never have I before, as a reader, been so invested and had such an affinity for the central characters and their plight.  Zusak's vanilla writing style with its short punchy chapters allows the reader to follow the central thread of the plot without distraction. One unique aspect of the narrative is that it is told from the point of view of Death. It is an interesting and ambitious perspective on the unfolding events, and Zusak makes it work. Death's narration portrays an overworked, ruthless but somehow compassionate being. Another feature of Zusak's writing is the interspersed plot revelations, often pertaining to the demise of certain characters, before the events actually transpire. The foreshadowing serves to cushion the blow for the reader when events take a disheartening turn.  This book is an instantclassic, and should be mandatory reading for adolescents and adults alike
B002QEXN2K|5.0|\\"Continuum\\" was released way back in 2006 and set the bar very high for John Mayer.  Since then, he's mostly been notable for being in the tabloids, usually about his love life.  With John Mayer, there is a clear musical progression from his less-than-compelling middle-of-the-road pop on \\"Room for Squares,\\" the more mature pop of \\"Heavier Things,\\" the blues departure in the John Mayer Trio side project, and the fusion of all the best stuff from those albums in Continuum.  Needless to say, with such a long delay since his last album the bar has been set high.    In this regard this album disappoints.  It does not show a musical progression.  It very much is middle-of-the-road pop. It does have good mature lyrics, but a lot of this stuff is nice background music that is not compelling on its own.    It starts with \\"Heartbreak Warfare,\\" which is a pretty catchy song but unfortunately repeats its melody several times rather than doing something more interesting with the song.  There has been a lot of criticism for his choice of Taylor Swift as a featured singer on \\"Half My Heart,\\" but whatever lack of a real contribution she makes, I found that to be the best song in the album.  It's just a good catchy pop song with great harmonies, even if it's a bit cutesy.  \\"Who Says\\" is the radio single - it's fine and innocuous, but like \\"Heartbreak Warfare,\\" the song is just too simple.    \\"Crossroads\\" is downright awful.  It is not Eric Clapton's song, he merely made it popular - but there is no comparison to Clapton's version, that's for sure.  It uses awful synthesizers for the main riff - listen to it a couple times and judge for yourself, but it's the one song on this album I always skip.  Other songs, such as \\"All We Ever Do Is Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" are decent enough songs but lack that certain something to make them anything more than that.    I do have to admit that the depth of his lyrics makes the album may be the thing that makes this \\"background music\\" ofan album not get too old upon each listen.  Pop music is mostly about the hooks and melodies, yes, but good lyrics certainly do encourage multiple listens.  Unlike \\"Continuum\\" though, there is really no blues influence on this album, and it seems that the blues-pop fusion combined with great guitar playing and good lyrics is where John Mayer really shines.  Let's hope he does more of his best next time.    UPDATE 2 FEB 2010: The original review was one written after I had listened to the album around a half-dozen times.  I have now listened to it 20 times or so.  This album, like many of John Mayer's albums, seems bland at first but grows on you after multiple listens.  He has a way of doing that, you know.  As for the blues influence, I do have to correct myself by mentioning that the last track on the album is very blues-influenced.  Also there are subtleties of blues influence throughout the entire album in various spots (\\"Perfectly Lonely\\" is another one) - it's just not as in-your-face as it was on Continuum, which perhaps may be a good thing.  Even \\"Crossroads,\\" which is still a weird interpretation of that classic song, has a great guitar solo and is good vibe in a weird way, I suppose.  I highly recommend the album - just give it a chance.  There are many other reviewers here who had to revise their review after listening to the album more!
B002436WFI|4.0|I saw this with my kids (ages 10 and 7) and they loved it.  However, be aware that this film (and Hogfather) have no close-captions.  The English being spoken in Britain is drifting further and further away from American English ... or perhaps we are drifting further away from them ... and so captions would be good so you don't have to rewind to make sure you caught all the jokes.  Also, watching with my father (who is nearly deaf, and hates his hearing aid) would be impossible, and that's a shame.

0440242576|4.0|John Grisham, as most of you know, can really tell a tale.  In this short book (less than 200pp) he introduces us to the Kranks, Luther and Nora, and their daughter Blair.  Nora is a Christmas queen that loves to do the holidays in a big way...decorations, gifts, the tree, and a huge Christmas Eve party, and they've always done it as a family.  This year, however, things are different when Blair enlists in the Peace Corps and flies to Peru the day after Thanksgiving for a year-long assignment.<br /><br />Luther and Nora see her off, and then depression starts to set in.  They both agree that Christmas just won't be the same without Blair.  Luther gets a bright idea and convinces Nora that they should \\"skip Christmas\\", save the money they'd usually spend on their usual celebration and take a cruise instead.<br /><br />Follow the adventures and misadventues that ensue when the Kranks tell their friends that they are \\"skipping Christmas\\" this year.<br /><br />Grisham then takes us along for the ride as the Kranks simultaneously prepare for their trip and fend off efforts of others who feel compelled to convince them that they should NOT skip Christmas.  The days tick by one by one, and the departure date creeps closer and closer.  Then the completely unexpected happens...what?  You'll have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Grisham's tale provides an interesting insight into the commercialization and outward trappings of Christmas on the one hand, and the true nature of universal brotherhood and community on the other.<br /><br />Thanks for a great tale!
B002RSDW80|4.0|I can't cook. At all. As in, the only things I have ever made with any success are cheesecake, brownies, and Ramen noodles. The neccessities of life, of course. I've heard some say that any one who can read can cook, but I think there is a huge distance between cooking and cooking well.<br /><br />That's why I surprised my self when I picked up Julie & Julia at the local movie store. Mainly, I picked it up because of Meryl Streep and Amy Adams. I love them both. And even though I can't cook good food myself, I certainly enjoy it when others do.<br /><br />I adored this movie. It was fun, and it made me laugh a number of times. The movie alternates between Julia Child's slow rise to fame as a cook in the 1950s and Julie Powell's attempt to cook and blog through the entire Mastering the Art of French Cooking book in one year.<br /><br />I loved watching the romance between the couples. It was so sweet. The kind that while I watched I was thinking that if I ever did get married, I'd want it to be to a guy like that.<br /><br />Julie & Julie is a great movie. End of sentence.

0743455967|5.0|I've read several of Mr. King's books, but they are just way too scary for me.  And those reads were many years ago.  I was curious though when I noticed he had recently written a book on writing.  It was terrific!  The first part of the book is basically his life story and how he started writing.  Very interesting read.  The next part is what he thinks it takes to write.  Now, I may not care for his style of books, but he is very successful and I found his thoughts about writing extremely straight-forward and exciting.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Yes, it is horribly inaccurate, but that doesn't matter to most of us. If I want a historical depiction of actual events I'll watch a documentary.     This movie has something for everyone; fighting, action, comedy, gore (too much for some), revenge, and an absolutely great love story. Not sure why I'm writing a review, seeing how everyone has seen it already, but here we are.

B0026NWBY2|4.0|This collection of Harrison tunes represents a good sampling from various points in his long musical career. However, it may not contain the particular favorites from every Harrison fan, so one would want to hold on to other recordings one may have. It is by no means exhaustive, but nevertheless, it is a very good (and good sounding) collection. It contains songs that I've heard many times in my life, and also some that are utterly new to me. The only thing is that the album starts with \\"Got My Mind Set on You,\\" which I would have placed in a position more accurately reflecting its chronology, but this is a minor quibble. The main thing is, if you like George Harrison, you will probably like this album also.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This film became an absolute must for my film collection after watching it once with my family.  The child actor, Catinca Untaru, is the centerpiece of this film.  Her lovely Romanian accent, her naive mischievousness, and her chemistry with the other characters endear any viewer to the story.  In addition to her presence, the film's scenes are breathtakingly beautiful, apparently without any special effects, and the richness of the colors and landscapes alone would make this film worth watching.  However, the storyline is also intriguing, as are the nuances within the storyline that, while sometimes slightly disturbing (e.g. violence, tribal rituals, depression), hold the viewer's interest.  I would recommend this film wholeheartedly, as would my entire family, because it inspires creativity with its exploration of the imagination.
B002SQ3664|1.0|This is one of the most uninformative, uninteresting, and unconvincing movies I've ever seen. If I wasn't too exhausted from the rest of the festival I would have walked out, but I have a policy not to do so for any film in case some how in the second act something brilliant makes up for the first - in this case a stereotypical to the point of being borderline racist/xenophobic (the `Jewish Mother' literally hoarding cash in her closet seen later hugging the pile while she forces her husband and sun to live in abject poverty) unappealing mix of unmotivated cliché acting and characters. One or two scenes are slightly interesting visually, but to fit in the bland loosely edited boring diagesis of the rest of the film's world they only occur on an acid trip. To put in a brash manner, Taking Woodstock was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life, and by far the worst I've encountered at a festival, from a sheer effort-in-filmmaking perspective - especially in contrast to prior work from such a beloved director.

Very exciting story just like the 1st book. I have already pre-ordered the 3rd, and now have to wait till the end of May.  If you like mystery's, read these books. Start with \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" since they are made to be read in order. You will not have all the background needed for this story with out reading the other one 1st.

B000JVSUS4|3.0|Baisically the movie was too long and the love story was tacked on and unnecessary. My grandfather was at Pearl Harbor (bugler West Virginia), he talked about it all the time, he saw the movie and he agreed with me. He liked the battle scenes, but thought the love story was dumb too. I think we both wanted (and I'm sure I'm not alone on this one) an updated version of \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" I think Michael Bay would have been better off doing that, and having the Doolittle raid at the end rather than the lame love story. Make it more like \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and less like \\"the Notebook\\" It was supposed to be a war movie not a chick flick! Oh well it is what it is.
1401323820|4.0|This was a present for my finance', he loves Castle and thought this book was a great spin off from the show. He liked that it stayed in the realms of what the show was like instead of being a major murder mystery book. He loved it and thought it was a great birthday gift.

0061730327|4.0|This book is a very interesting and encouraging story for young readers.  It provides insight into what life is like in Africa and is a good story of the indomitable human spirit. This will encourage young readers to keep after their dreams in spite of any obstacles.  The creativity of man cannot be thwarted.<br /><br />One part of the book that I particularly enjoyed was the story about William and his friend who developed a business repairing transistor radios.  They salvaged discarded batteries and sorted through them to find the ones that still had a little power left to run their radios.  They swapped components from one radio to another to get a working radio.  They rigged up a homemade soldering iron to solder components in place.<br /><br />With curiosity, persistence, and some drive, this book shows that a lack of \\"things\\" is not enough to stop anyone for achieving their dreams!
B0026P7O6K|4.0|I'm generally not into the mainstream female-led bands.  I generally prefer European female-led symphonic metal/rock.  But Halestorm has really impressed me very quickly.  They are heavier than most of the mainstream female-led stuff that we hear in the US: comparable to bands like Seether, Shinedown, Three Days Grace, and Lostprophets.  But they don't try to be any of these bands, they much have their own sound.  Lzzy has a great voice and carries the songs well.  The guitar parts also sound great.    Nearly all the songs are very catchy.  Stand outs include \\"I Get Off\\", \\"Love/Hate Heartbreak\\", and \\"Dirty Work.\\"  \\"I Get Off\\" is probably the song that sold me on this album because Lzzy really rocks out on the chorus.  I'd say the only song that I'm not a huge fan of is \\"Bet U wish U had me back\\" which is more mellow than many of the other songs.      I wouldn't even bring it up except that I've been seeing people say it everywhere but no, Halestorm is absolutely not the \\"new Evanescence.\\"  Evanescence has more of a gothic sound while Halestorm is less minor (for lack of another word) and closer to the sound of the bands I mentioned above.    Overall, I was very impressed.  I would like to see more from this band in the future.  I think it's a great pick for fans of alternative mainstream rock or even fans of some of those European female-led bands (Within Temptation, Nightwish, Delain, Xandria).

0385342020|4.0|Sophie Kinsella always entertains me with her novels. I walked with Becky Bloomwood to all the shops in the \\"Shopaholic\\" series, I went along on Lexi's adventures of amnesia in \\"Remember Me?\\", and I laughed as Samantha goes from being an office flunky to an amateur housekeeper in \\"The Undomestic Goddess\\". I was thrilled to see this book, \\"Twenties Girl\\", in the library as a quick read and snatched it right up.<br /><br />And there was no false advertising. This was a quick read. I was at the library on Thursday, and closed the book after the final chapter today, Tuesday, only 5 days later. I loved it. I devoured it. It was a great way to distract me from any stress or any other issues going on in my life. I needed a quick, light, entertaining read, and Sophie indulged me.<br /><br />Her characters are just so easy to relate to. I don't know what that says about my life, but it's true. And adding a ghost to the crazy mix was an adventure that I just couldn't pass up. Lara and Sadie make a great pair. Two completely different viewpoints and generations thrown together in one erratic enterprise. Something new happened with each page turn and I was so excited to find out what happened next throughout the whole novel. I love books like this.<br /><br />I admit it proudly: I love chick lit. Life can be so stressful and ridiculous that it's nice to sit and relax with an easy read and a cup of coffee (or tea, depending on your preference). And if Sophie Kinsella isn't the queen of chick lit, then she should be. All of her books are great, and I recommend any of them.

B0028SVXR6|4.0|I'm a huge fan of The Mars Volta, so I had a bias opinion before even listening to this album. I must say they definitely took a different approach to this album. It has a more subdued, laid back vibe than what the band is normally known for. This was, in a way, kind of refreshing to see them try new things. The production and mix quality is top notch. I highly recommend this album if you like progressive rock or are a fan of The Mars Volta.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|'Element of Freedom' is a very different album for Alicia Keys. The music is rather understated and soft; there's no real stand-out 'hit' like the previous album's \\"No One\\"; it's a bit slow paced. I think it's great that Keys decided to take a chance with her music and take a route that doesn't have much commercial appeal or follow the path of her past hits. She's straying from the formula that's made her a big superstar so in many ways, the style and chances she's taken on this perhaps harp back to the 'freedom' theme. That being said, and this is no attack on Keys or her abilities, but I really found little to like about 'Element of Freedom.' While the lyrics may be strong and heartfelt, the message of the songs is somewhat killed and silenced by the mediocre, shoddy, dull musical accompaniment that runs rampant throughout the album.<br /><br />The Good: As stated, what you may enjoy most about 'Element of Freedom' is that this is really unlike any past album she's done. You can tell she wanted to take a chance with her usual style and play with different influences. While the expected piano element is at play on some tracks, others feature her voice more so than her piano playing. \\"Love Is Blind\\" stands out more because of her voice and attitude than anything; her vulnerability shines through on \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\". She's able to pack emotion into songs with \\"Love Is My Disease\\" and \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" feels like classic Keys with swelling vocals and the piano in the background. These few songs fit in nicely to Keys' catalog of music and don't feel too out there and far fetched.<br /><br />The Bad: Listening to the album from start to finish feels more like a chore than an enjoyable experience. What I didn't enjoy about 'Element of Freedom' is how similar each song sounds. While this helps ease the transition from track to track, giving you the feeling that each track somehow evolves from the previous one, it creates a feeling that you're listening to one song being reworked and replayed over and over like a drawn out improvisation. The only time the music feels as if it's changed and gone into a new direction is on the duet with Beyonc&eacute; \\"Put It It In a Love Song\\" where the album departs from the sad/melancholy vibe and picks up the beat and drops the serious tone for something carefree and fun. Perhaps that's another weakness of the album; Keys has the ability to work with so many different styles, as seen in the previous albums, and takes on both the downside and joyful aspects of love and relationships. Yet in 'Elements of Freedom' it feels as if she's restrained or harping on one continuous note for the entire album.<br /><br />There are import and exclusive editions of the album available that I recommend tracking down because they have bonus tracks that I feel should have been included in the standard edition because they would have definitely broken up the monotony of the album and made it more balanced and even. In all, an average/mediocre album. It is, in my opinion, definitely not Alicia Keys at her best. Some of the tracks feel or sound unfinished, the album feels a bit like a work in progress, definitely not a desired end product.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"How It Feels To Fly\\", \\"Put It In A Love Song\\", \\"Like The Sea\\", *\\"Pray For Forgiveness\\" *(Bonus Track not included on the standard edition)eing reworked and replayed over and over like a drawn out improvisation.

1401323820|4.0|A huge fan of the Castle TV show I was very excited to receive this book for my birthday. I love the novelty of having the book Richard Castle has written within the context of the show. Great marketing! However, I found the actual book itself to be a disappointing read. Rule number one in writing is to know your audience, and I felt this book failed on that attempt. The characters in the book use profanity a lot more freely than the characters on the show. As a fan, that was not something I would have expected. Richard Castle on the TV show is following Detective Beckett for the purpose of researching his new series of fictional novels, but I felt the book too closely mirrored the TV show, almost reading like a script rather than a fictional novel. I expected him to use the research to create new characters and stories. I found that it did not draw me in as a book should, and failed at keeping me wanting more. I love a good book that I can't put down. Unfortunately this was not one of those. Having said all that, I still love the novelty of it, and would buy it for that alone. My hope is that if anyone in marketing and research reads this they will have some constructive criticism for the next one.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|On studio album #4, Alicia Keys stretches herself even more, vocally and musically. She uses that higher/strained-sounding register she introduced on her last album (especially on a song like \\"No one\\"), as well as huskier, Rockier sounding tones. Lyrically, there seems to be a theme of pain and longing caused by love.<br /><br />The result is a rather eclectic sounding album, very pleasing to the ears. She sounds virtually unrecognisable on the opening Rock-tinged ballad \\"Love is blind\\" (with awesome harmonies and an impassioned fiery delivery from Keys), my absolute favourite song. The single \\"Doesn't mean anything\\" reminds one of the afore mentioned \\"No one\\" (same thumping beats and feel), while \\"Try sleeping with a broken heart\\" is simply beautiful with feathery vocals offset by thundering beats, and a nice piano coda.<br /><br />Everything stands out really; \\"Wait til you see my smile\\" (with marching beats and soulful harmonies), the beautiful piano ballad \\"That's how strong my love is\\" (reminds me of \\"Tender love\\" by Force MDs), the melancholic soul of \\"Un-thinkable (I'm ready)\\", the Reggae-tinged \\"Love is my disease\\", the cascading piano-sprinkled \\"Like the sea\\" (with a classical overture, and interesting synth flourishes), the sunny sounding \\"This bed\\" (on which she pines for her lover), the soulful ballad \\"Distance and time\\", and the Retro Soul of \\"How it feels to fly\\".<br /><br />Closing is a drastic makeover of her hit with Jay-Z, \\"Empire state of mind (Part II) Broken down\\", a very soulful Jazzy piano ballad with just Keys vocals. The lone song I don't quite get is the contemporary R&B dance song \\"Put It In A Love Song\\" featuring Beyonc&eacute;, and which can best be described as \\"Single ladies part II\\". Same skeletal sound, chants and drum rolls, and even similar lyrical theme: \\"Say you love me, then put it in a love song\\". I didn't like it at first, but it does grow on you and if you're one of those that loved \\"Single ladies\\" (I wasn't), you'll love this.<br /><br />I think this album will catch fans of her Soul sound a bit off guard as it is more experimental, but it's an album that richly rewards. Definitely one of her best efforts!catch fans of her Soul sound a bit off guard as it is more experimental, but it's an album that richly rewards. Definitely one of her best efforts!
B000002U9E|5.0|Released 3 years after \\"The Dreaming\\", \\"Hounds of Love\\" is a more grounded and accessible album than it's predecessor. It is Kate's second album to reach #1 on the UK album chart, the other being \\"Never For Ever\\".  \\"Hounds of Love\\" is produced by Kate Bush herself. After the high studio cost accumulated while recording \\"The Dreaming\\"(which she also self-produced), Kate built her own private 24-track studio near her home in order to rid herself of those cost-related time constraints.    The first side of the album is titled `Hounds of Love', and it is a collection of great songs dealing with different types of love. The second side is a concept piece called `The Ninth Wave' about a woman floating in the sea trying to stay awake so she doesn't drown...and I'll leave it at that.  As for the individual songs on the first side, they are essential Kate Bush recordings. `Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)' was the first single, released about a month before the album. The song touches on the idea of a man and a woman \\"swapping places\\" to see what it's like as the opposite sex. The second single, `Cloudbusting', is based on the controvercial practices and studies of Wilhelm Reich observed through the eyes of his son. The title track was chosen as the third single, a song about the fear of falling in love. 'The Big Sky', which was the fourth and final single from \\"Hounds of Love\\", is about admiring the sky and watching the clouds morph into different shapes. 'Mother Stands For Comfort' is the slowest song on the first side, a song that deals with the mother/daughter relationship.     \\"Hounds of Love\\" is a excellent and flawless artistic achievement. A body of work you have to experience atleast once in your life...5 Stars!!
1932100660|5.0|Well written and loaded with so much information.  Why do so many people (worldwide) have their eyes closed to what they put in their stomachs?
B000IOM0YC|3.0|This film has not held up particularly well over the years. The story is overwrought, overly long and tended to gloss over the historical events I was most interested in. Jack Nicholson is great as the playwright, Eugene O'Neill, and Beatty plays zeal well. However, I don't know that Diane Keaton was the best choice for the role, even though I am usually a big fan. A good movie, but not a great movie...    Also, I will admit I'm no tech wizard, but I don't understand why the film requires 2 Blu-Ray discs, as I understand them to contain about 6 times the information of standard DVDs.  Does anyone believe this film necessitated a 2-disc BR release when 'Gone With the Wind' is satisfied with 1 disc?
B000ZELISO|5.0|This is by far my favorite Harry Potter movie so far. The story was dark and intriguing. I thought it was a lot better than previous movies in the way it progressed the story, and in the acting and dialog. The other movies always seemed to have parts where the acting and dialog were cheesy and corny. Those parts are gone in this movie and as such it seems much more well done and maturer, especially the acting. This movie is also outstanding on blu ray. I HIGHLY recommend getting it in blu ray if you can, it's simply amazing.

Two years of prescription drugs, custom-made orthotics and physiotherapy couldn't solve these issues that came about from sports.<br /><br />After I read this book it just all made sense. I started spending more time barefoot, bought some Vibrams, and changed my diet (eat like a poor person).<br /><br />All my issues went away. I ran 5 miles for the first time in my life last weekend.<br /><br />This stuff is real and has helped me. Not only is this book an inspirational and dramatic read, it will help solve sports injuries. Priceless. I've recommended this to all my friends.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|The main character is sooo French, having cultivated a romantic fixation on the oddest thing, strining a wire between two huge edifices and walking across. Not really my cup of tea, but nevertheless, this is a really well done documentary and you've got to give the guy credit. He's stayed true to himself and he got to be the best at what he does. Not many people can make that claim. There is a lot to think about and remember in this film.

But capable scholars can help us engage the text with better understanding of what the author means by what the author wrote (the meaning and significance is determined by the author, not the reader--or the commentator). The ESV Study Bible is not perfect; there will always be debate around 'problem' passages. Yet every true Christian seeking the benefit of seasoned teachers who love God's Word will find this study Bible a good investment.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|Although this film probably won't go into the history books as a 'greatest of all time', it is very much a solid sci-fi action thriller. Don't try working out the details of the time-travel aspects of it, and you should easily be able to maintain your suspension of disbelief and enjoy the movie. Characters are fun and well acted. The action is fairly relentless. The special effects are astounding, top-notch.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|I vaguely remember \\"Let the Right One In\\" being released in the theaters in the fall of 2008. Unfortunately, it did not receive wide acclaim from the public, even though it gained many awards and was a critical success. Plus, it was probably in the theaters for all of three weeks. It's just more evidence that a film that has subtitles, takes a little patience to watch and may not have enough gore, cheap scares or car chases can be easily dismissed. Perhaps \\"LTROI\\" will gain a larger audience via the DVD/Blueray route. Let's hope so.    The story has been covered by many of the other reviews here - a 12 year old boy, Oskar, bullied at school, lonely from being emotionally disconnected from his divorced parents, finds friendship, strength and trust from a new girl Eli, who moves in to the apartment next door with her guardian/companion, an older man named Hakan. Eli is also twelve. And she's fragile looking, pale and only seems to come out at night. Their first encounter is kind of creepy but they continue to meet each other in the playground of their apartment complex. They bond over a Rubik's Cube of all things and slowly gain each other's trust and understanding.    The two young actors, Kare Hedebrant (Oskar) and Lina Leandersson (Eli) both give genuine, wonderful performances. I would've paid much money to see a whole film of scenes with just their two characters interacting.  One of the best shots in the entire film lasts for only about 15 seconds but shows how lonely Eli feels when she tries to suppress her need to communicate with Oskar via Morse code through the wall that separates their two apartments. And there is another great scene where Eli pleads with Oskar to try and see life through her eyes. She's clearly the wiser of the two, for good reason.    Director Tomas Alfredson and screenwriter John Ajvide Lindqvist (on whose novel the film is based) focus more tightly on Oskar and Eli's story than getting involved with too many minor plotlines that are inthe book. This is really not a horror movie. It's more of a drama mixed in with some horror elements. Even so, there are a few moments of dark humor as well - one involving an inquisitive dog and another with some suspicious, hyperactive cats. The cinematography is quiet and lush. And the film is beautifully scored with moving compositions by Johan Soderqvist.    I'm reading the book right now and it's quite enjoyable as well, though a bit darker than the film. For those who like the film and want some more details, or a more fleshed out story including motivations of minor characters, the book is highly recommended. It's a page turner.

1593083343|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

0786939532|5.0|In the Underdark, far beneath the earth's surface lies the vast city of Menzoberranzan, home of the drow; the Dark Elves. Here they worship the Spider Queen and in return she gives them powers and guides them. Deceit, treachery, and murder is her way.  She is the Queen of Chaos. The drow live strong by this way of life. There is no room for the weak. If weakness is discovered then eradication is the only answer.<br /><br />Menzoberranzan is segregated by house name, and within each house the ruling figure is the Matron mother, as males are less than females. The top and most powerful eight houses make up the ruling council. Each house covets a higher ranking position. And when an opportunity arises, they plan and pounce, but in order to not suffer any consequences, the vile, evil deed must be done wholly and completely. There cannot be any survivors of that house or the offending house suffers!<br /><br />A peculiar drow, Drizzt Do'Urden is born, and on the very day that house Do'Urden makes its move against another house, eliminating it and moving their rank to the ninth ruling house in Menzoberranzan. As Drizzt grows and begins his studies to become a drow warrior, he struggles within himself to conform to the the ways of his people. For inside he knows the wrongness that his people suffer at their own hands. One must watch over their shoulder, but in doing so they will surely die from the front.<br /><br />The ending left you with Drizzt leaving behind that which he always reluctantly called home, after an incident that left me saddened. But Drizzt will persevere, because thanks to his mentor, his father, he was given a sense of morality, and Drizzt will not let a certain sacrifice go unheeded.<br /><br />I LOVED this book! Written in such a way that it never dragged, and easy to follow, always something occurred, usually some sort of treachery and back-stabbing, and loaded with sword and sorcery action. The beginning of Drizzt's life, the hierarchy, the magic, the odd creatures of the Underdark and the characters fell together with such precision. I couldn't have asked for a better book to appease my need for fantasy. And this was only the beginning! I have some fifteen books to remain immersed in the legend that is Drizzt for whenever I feel the urge to visit him and his escapades.k and the characters fell together with such precision.

B002TZS5GU|4.0|Brian and Danny grew up as two brothers who were relatively close to one another. They cherish the memories they have of Turtle Beach, a beach their family vacationed to every summer. The abandoned motel in Turtle Beach may be their best bet of surviving the highly contagious disease that now plagues the entire country and possibly the world. Not much is known about the virus other than the victims coughing up blood and bleeding from the ears as their condition worsens. Brian actually came up with a few rules that will hopefully get him, his girlfriend Bobby, his brother Danny, and Danny's friend Kate through this disease ridden world to Turtle Beach clean. The rules include avoiding the infected at all costs, disinfecting anything they've touched in the past 24 hours, and that the infected are already dead as there is no cure. You may survive if you stick to the rules, but actually abiding by them is an entirely different story.<br /><br />Right off the bat, people are probably going to compare Carriers to Zombieland because of the rules. Carriers was released a full month before Zombieland, but Paramount Vantage folded upon its initial release causing its wide release to be an extremely limited one at the last minute (I think it wound up playing at only two theaters in the country). Expectations rise unintentionally in situations such as this. \\"This is that horror film that was practically shelved earlier this year and is finally being released.\\" The result is a horror film that is well worth watching, but may not be entirely what you're expecting.<br /><br />Carriers is more about establishing an atmosphere than anything else. Everything is abandoned and rightfully so as most people were picked off handfuls at a time by this pandemic. The entire film is more like the first half hour of 28 Days Later where Jim wakes up in an abandoned hospital and realizes how empty the streets of London are. There aren't masses of the infected running around lusting for brains or wanting to tear humans apart in Carriers. The story follows these four friends as they journey across the country to this supposed sanctuary where they hope to tough it out until this disease runs its course. Carriers is more of a slow burn as things turn from bad to worse very slowly and snowball as the film goes on.<br /><br />Chris Pine is really the drawing factor of the film. His role as Brian is kind of like a more intense version of his role as Kirk in Star Trek from earlier this year. Brian comes off as an inconsiderate prick the first half of the film and seems to only do things that benefit himself. The second half is where his character gets interesting though. The speech he gives Danny about their parents and telling Danny that he only told him what he wanted to hear is the turning point for Brian. Chris Pine shines as things begin to roll downhill for Brian as his emotions take center stage and his true demeanor is revealed.<br /><br />Everything else in the film pretty much feels like routine manuevers when it comes to films revolving around viral outbreaks as some main characters contract the disease, they resort to drastic measures to survive, and begin to question their humanity along the way. The most disappointing part of the film is the ending as things just seem to kind of stop without much of a resolution. It seems like films like this either end this way or have a really depressing ending and that's its biggest flaw. Movie buffs who have seen films concerning pandemics already have a rough idea of how the film is going to end and it's about time to mix that up a bit. There's got to be a decent way to end the film that offers something a bit different that could wrap everything up until that point, but also leave enough room open for a sequel if need be.<br /><br />Carriers may be a bit slow at first and doesn't really offer anything you probably haven't seen before in a film like this, but is still worth seeing for Chris Pine's performance. It's kind of a more serious take on Zombieland without actual zombies running or stumbling around with an atmosphere similar to the one established in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later. If you're a fan of films involving a virus that has wiped out most of the human population, then this is still worth a watch.eland without actual zombies running or stumbling around with an atmosphere similar to the one established in Danny Boyle's 28 Days Later.

0439023483|5.0|Walk..wait maybe you should run...to the bookstore, library or wherever you gets book and pick up a copy of The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.  I've read many wonderful things about this book.  And if you look at ratings on Barnes and Noble or maybe Amazon, you can see it gets overall fantastic reviews.  This made me hesitant, because I don't want to be disappointed.  It's why I put off reading the Twilight and Harry Potter series for so long. But, I'm glad I didn't wait for this one (or least wait too long).  Tthis book was everything I hoped and was looking for in a new series. I've read a lot of books this year, and only one other has captured my attention the way this one did. I borrowed this from the library, but you can bet I will be buying my own copy now.  I have to warn you though, its part of a supposed trilogy.  Apparently there were quite a few people who were upset by this (some people don't like books in a series while others didn't realize and were disappointed by abrupt ending).  The sequal \\"Catching Fire\\" just came out on September 1st, and the 3rd book in the series comes out in August of 2010!
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Blu-Ray Review<br />Movie:  4.5/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.6/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)<br /><br />Anybody remember that Italian war movie from the 70s with Bo Svenson and Fred Williamson? They had ridiculously over-the-top shoot-outs and naked Nazi women firing machine guns! Anyone? No?<br /><br />Well, Quentin Tarantino has taken the theme and topic of that silly film and turned it into something of his own. \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" doesn't quite have as much Nazi-killing as I expected, but it excels brilliantly with its plot, story, characters, dialogue, acting, cameramanship, and music selection. It is a bit strange perhaps, with some absurdity, but it is all earnest, original, and of decent quality. There are a couple of bloody brutal parts, but it's never over-done. There are some funny parts too, but it's also never over-done. Additionally, the movie has some interesting cultural/historical references and homages. Most of it even serves as a film about film and filmmaking, as the plot has a lot to do with a cinema. If you liked Tarantino's other work (especially \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" which has a plot structure similar to \\"Inglourious Basterds\\") or it you want to see a war drama of a different nature, check this one out by all means.<br /><br />The disc has superb quality. The video looks incredibly sharp, clean, clear, and vivid; I saw no problems worth mentioning. Sound quality is excellent (DTS-HD MA 5.1). It includes numerous extras, and a digital copy. Comes with a slipcover.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|5.0 stars<br /><br />An exemplary film and easily one of the finest animated movies of them all, Up is up there with Fantasia and Snow White and you name it. Surprisingly sad at various points, this is an amazingly emotional film, which somehow feels funny, in a good way.<br /><br />After seeing this in 3D in a theatre, I think the blu-ray is better. The 3D still felt like an effect; the blu-ray through hdmi on a decent flat screen is astonishing. The colors on Kevin the \\"snipe\\" were easily the deepest vermillion, most translucent purple, and so on, that I have yet to see on our LCD screen. Incredible, and a pleasure just on its own.<br /><br />Add a perfect script, flawless animation with especially natural lighting effects, and an overall patina of unstinting quality, and Pixar has made an animated feature that will wear as well as any film of any sort. The retro feel is integral to its charm, and the whole story feels timeless. I really can't think of anything I don't like about Up. Even the sad bits feel authentic, not Disney fake.<br /><br />The various extras are excellent, especially the short that preceeded Up in theatres, and the fascinating documentary about Tepui, the original Paradise Falls area in Venezuela. The folks who made this film seem very sweet and very smart, and that sums up Up.<br /><br />Can't recommend this one highly enough.

Most of my students, however, felt it was at times confusing and other times boring. I think this book is more appealing to those over 20 years of age who may have shared some similar experiences as Chris McCandless. It is a challenging read with intense vocabulary. It is one of those books that has changed me and how I see life. Not sure my students were ready for a change.

B0010X8NF0|4.0|India was the star of this movie, at least for me -- the colors and vibrancy were amazing. It showed a side of India that are less often seen, particularly since much of the movie involves a long train trip, and most of the rest, an unplanned excursion in the desert (the area around Jaipur).    The story line involves three brothers, apparently wealthy, who don't get along. The father, we learn, is deceased, and the mother has vanished from their lives. The family is dysfunctional and the brothers aren't doing so well as individuals, either. The oldest, who tends to be very controlling, put together this trip as a time for spiritual renewal and healing for the family. They are to meet on a train, the Darjeeling Limited, to go visit their mother, who has moved to India. Their behavior is so bad that they are soon asked to leave the train, and then they meet up with some locals.    A couple of things bothered me, however. The first was the lack of subtlety -- all traits and messages were writ large, lest you miss them. The controlling nature of the oldest brother is broadly exaggerated (he takes the passports to make sure no-one loses them or leaves without his permission; in the dining car, without asking, he orders for each of them). The symbolism of the final scene (POSSIBLE SPOILER FOLLOWS.......................................................................................................they catch the train but leave all their expensive baggage behind them) is ridiculously obvious -- what we're supposed to see as the personal growth that these horrible brothers experienced. That gets me to the part I liked least: how easy it was to dislike just about every character in this movie. For me, I need to like at least some of the characters!    Still, I think this is a movie worth watching, if for no other reason than the India setting.

0380789035|5.0|This book is fascinating, titillating, smart and funny.  This is not a light read on vacation because the book asks you to suspend reality and be immersed in it.  Mr. Gaiman makes many cultural references, societal commentary (not always good) and loads of mythological elements weaved into this fascinating story.<br /><br />The book's main character takes us through a journey which weaves a tale of how the old gods (Odin, Thor, Anubis, elves, leprechauns, etc.), who were brought over  to the US by immigrants, are dying because people stopped believing in them to favor the new gods (media, celebrities, technology, money and more).<br /><br />The book follows \\"Shadow\\" upon his release from jail due to the death of his wife in a car accident.  Shadow gets a job as bodyguard for a mysterious man named Wednesday.  As they travel across the US visiting Wednesday's friends it is slowly reveled that Wednesday is an incarnation of Odin who is recruiting the old gods for an epic battle against the new gods in order to regain their power and status.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away as this is a wonderful book, but the storyline gets much more complex, interesting and fascinating.

0316066524|5.0|My two cents is that \\"Infinite Jest\\" is like those grand sweeping novels from Tolstoy et al in that to read it is to experience a full life (due to the length and how comprehensive it is on the experiences of life), except it's set in an oddball alternative future DFW-verse of North America. I wouldn't say this was a quick read but it is the type of tome that you can leave and then come back to later. I enjoyed playing in DFW's imagination and with his somewhat obsessive characters.    You will either love or hate this book. Reading the first few pages before buying is suggested.
B002WY65W4|5.0|ZOMBIELAND<br /><br />STARRING: Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, Abigail Breslin, Amber Heard and Mike White<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Ruben Fleischer<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Horror / Comedy<br />Release Date: 02 October 2009<br /><br />You know it's been a bad year for movies when a film with a title like Zombieland gets a perfect score and was hands down the funniest film of the year. I'd even go so far as to say it was better than Shaun of the Dead.<br /><br />I'm a sucker for zombie movies in general (even though there aren't that many great ones) and I see anything and everything that Woody Harrelson does. So throw the two of them together and you are bound to have one hell of a film right? Right!<br /><br />Pile on more amazing actors like Jesse Eisenberg, who is destined to be the next John Cusack; Abigail Breslin who will be the next Julia Roberts; Emma Stone who will be a new someone all together and you're in for a genuine cinematic treat.<br /><br />I was so excited to see this film and while I did have expectations for it, they were nowhere even close to what the film actually delivers. It could very easily be nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay. It's filled with wit and twists, was shot beautifully and the comedy never skips a beat. No wonder these actors were down for the ride; the script must have been amazing.<br /><br />The film starts out in the muck of the end of the world, overrun with zombies. It was one of the best opening credit sequences I have ever seen in my life and must have cost a fortune. There are never-ending stylized slow-motion shots of zombies being bashed and blown to bits and people being attacked; all seen to the amazing sounds of an old school track by none other than Metallica. And the great music doesn't stop there; we get plenty of great tunes throughout the course of the film.<br /><br />We meet Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) who is named after his hometown in Ohio. Columbus is a softy of a kid who didn't have the greatest life pre-zombies and may actually prefer his life post-zombies; despite the fact that he very well could die a virgin in a world overtaken by zombies.<br /><br />He was a loaner then and is an even bigger loaner now. In an attempt to stay alive, he's decided to play it safe and has created a hilarious but strategic set of rules to live by in order to survive this apocalyptic adventure. We learn these rules through laugh-out-loud narrated scenes of him and others in action with the zombies.<br /><br />Zombies are pretty much the safest monster you would ever want to come into contact with in reality. I think that's what makes these movies so fun and likeable. Perhaps something else is that many of us want to be that guy or gal on screen, smashing and destroying zombies. You can do to them what you would secretly like to do to your annoying neighbor or arrogant boss, and feel absolutely no remorse whatsoever!<br /><br />Evidently many of us have an itch for killing and a taste for blood somewhere, way down deep inside of us; or these movies would not make more than 25 million dollars in an opening weekend. And by that I don't mean that we all want to go out and murder or kill; but at the very least a lot of us want to watch someone else do it (in movies of course).<br /><br />Then if you consider the apocalypse side, as devastating as it would be, clearly we enjoy the idea of that as well. Look at all of these huge blockbusters over the last decade alone that have made a killing off of the destruction of our beloved planet.<br /><br />Zombieland nails that fantasy in the chest. This is one of the major components that make this film work so well. Not only do we laugh at the zombies, but we get to see our characters partake in all of the great and worry-free stress-relievers that we would all enjoy doing if it were the end of the world; like smashing up a perfectly good store just because you can; or finding a deserted truck filled to the brim with delicious treats and no-one to tell you that you can't help yourself.<br /><br />The character in the film that gets the most use out of this newly found freedom is Tallahassee; played by Woody Harrelson. Tallahassee may even like killing zombies more than The Bear liked killing Nazis in Inglourious Basterds. He refuses to use guns unless absolutely necessary. He finds way more pleasure in bashing them in with car-doors, banjos, baseball-bats and a million other common household items; and we get a kick out of watching him do it.<br /><br />Harrelson may be a goofball in this film, but his performance is genuine and you believe him in every scene. All of the actors truly suck you in and sometimes you even forget you're watching a zombie movie.<br /><br />Tallahassee meets up with Columbus and they almost instantly hit it off, despite the fact that they have virtually nothing in common; with the exception that they're in this mess together and neither of them has been infected. They decide to stick together.<br /><br />Eventually the two of them meet up with two ladies: Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin); all of the characters call each other by the name of their hometown, which is a nice little touch. I won't spoil how funny their meeting is and I especially will not give-away where they all end up going.<br /><br />I love the man's work but DO NOT read Ebert's review of this film until after you have seen it. A huge spoiler was revealed and I'm not sure he's even aware of how big of one it was; trust me folks, it's a big one. It's perhaps the funniest and most enjoyable section of the film and is spent with a Hollywood legend. The scenes with this person are beyond genius. I would very much like to know if the script was written with this character in mind, or if they were added later. God bless the filmmakers for putting that sequence together either way. It only adds to the comedy of the scene that Woody Harrelson co-starred in a film with this actor in real life, and yet it is never mentioned as Harrelson is acting here.<br /><br />You would never guess that the artists behind this project were amateurs as far as the big screen is concerned. This is the first major film for both of the writers (Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick) as well as the director (Ruben Fleischer) but I'm sure we will be seeing a lot more from all of them. This is astonishing work for anyone in the business, let alone fresh talent. Rumor has it a sequel is already in the works.<br /><br />Zombieland will give you your blood, it will give you more laughs than any of the comedies you've seen this year and you will be more than entertained and will probably want to see it again.<br /><br />My only complaint is that I would have loved to see another 20 minutes or so with these characters slaying zombies; it was seriously that entertaining.<br /><br />Hopefully Zombieland will show the writers and directors of 2009's biggest movies (with the exception of Star Trek) that clearly you don't need your film to be jam-packed full of useless explosions; and expensive but crappy special effects; and horrible actresses just for the sake of eye candy, to make it good. You just need to put the time into the story and let great actors do the rest.you can't help yourself.

My only complaint is that I would have loved to see another 20 minutes or so with these characters slaying zombies; it was seriously that entertaining.     Hopefully Zombieland will show the writers and directors of 2009's biggest movies (with the exception of Star Trek) that clearly you don't need your film to be jam-packed full of useless explosions; and expensive but crappy special effects; and horrible actresses just for the sake of eye candy, to make it good.

B000ZEE3I6|2.0|This film is nothing but setup, and at 2 1/2 hours, that's a crime. At the end, I felt absolutely nothing. The book didn't leave an impression on me, either, but at least it had more details that made it more worthwhile. I loved the \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" movie, so I was surprised at this mistep from the same director. Blame it on the source material, I guess.
059004513X|5.0|i loved this story when i was a child so i bought it for my daughter.  she just loves the story.  the person i got it from had rips in about 5 pages.  but it is a great story any way.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It came fast, and the day it was to come out on dvd. I was happy and satisfied with the entire process, and I will always order dvds through Amazon.
B000AP04EW|3.0|this is an ok movie but not the best movie that mr pitt or mrs. julie did before.  it was a boring movie.
B00000IHC7|5.0|I am amazed every time I listen to these recordings.  Man, this guy could play and sing! He really did put his all into it.  This collection is much more polished than the others. Some don't care for that, but I've seen him live a few times, and this comes closest to a live album, energy-wise, but with a decent enough recording.  He's really at the top of his game here. This is my favorite Rory album, it's urgency and intentionality make it so very special.  Fly Off the Handle is just a killer blues track.  Every song is a crafted gem.
0756656230|5.0|My son first saw this in the bookstore. He loved it. So did his cousin and older brother. (9,9 and 13)This is a Christmas gift so he hasn't had a chance to really go through it all, but I think it's something he'll want to keep(and not outgrow).
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is one of the best cds I have bought in a long time.  Susan Boyle's range of tunes have no limit.  I believe she chose a great collection of music and she does them justice.  As someone who started her career with a bang, I think she has settled down and focused on her talent and let that speak for her instead of the media.  I look forward to her next cd.  I say, \\"Susan Boyle, good for you.\\"
B0000X61UU|5.0|I did this workout years ago and it is timeless. It works your whole body and is fun. I recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to break a sweat and have fun too! It is not daunting. It is fun and great!! Over the years I have been in great shape, and then I had four kids and my shape changed. :) This has been great for all time periods in my life. I have done a lot of workouts and this is by far my favorite. I even bought one for my workout buddy for the times we end up skipping the gym. It is such a great alternative.
B002OOG6RQ|2.0|somehow it is not monumental, not huge, not hard, not heart-tearing.  66% of what rammstein used to sound like;  it's just like the old songs, but less.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This year, besides appearing on Jay-Z's mega selling track \\"Empire State of Mind,\\" Alicia Keys is being overshadowed by more in your face female artists from Lady Gaga to Ke$ha. Her first two singles have not made a huge dent, and it's a shame for the latter, \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart,\\" is a prince song at its finest with a gorgeous falsetto and synth line that is matched by, \\"This Bed,\\" (but that song leans more heavily in a Vanity 6 mode of operation).     The Element of Freedom is a much stronger album than her last one, \\"As I Am.\\" The lyrics on her last disc left me wanting, but on this disc there is a clear and precise concept working: love is dangerous, beautiful, painful and full of beautiful hooks and melodies that will imprint themselves into your brain and draw you into every track on this album.     Among the strongest cuts is, \\"Love is Blind.\\" The rawness in her voice is unaffected and overly dramatic and goes deep into the mix - it's excellent. And is, almost, a complete 180 from what she is known for sonically. \\"Love is the Disease,\\" \\"Wait 'Til You See My Smile\\" and the stellar \\"Distance and Time,'\\" all go for the emotional jugular, and work brilliantly.     There is a quiet lushness with this album that I haven't felt since \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\\" She doesn't seem to be holding back. Her voice is impeccable, the range on display in \\"How it Feels\\" to fly, with its slow burn to the soaring choir is another jewel in a disc that is flawless.    This is Alicia Keys at her best. Her voice, lyrics and melodies are just perfection on this album. I can't recommend it enough.
B002VH7P4O|4.0|The Beatles USB key is a great example of how to do a box set in the 21st century.  In addition to MP3, the key contains 24-bit FLAC files, which offer the best possible audio quality and tickles my inner audiophile.  The Beatles in 24-bit sound unveils new levels of depth that I never heard on vinyl or CD; certain subtle sounds and effects that I was never aware of are suddenly present as if I was sitting at the mixing console with the Fab Four.    Why only four stars?  This key has some technical issues that hopefully could be resolved with future USB box sets.  The integrated player, which look cool, only plays the MP3s, and thus has inferior sound quality.  Furthermore, there are no included AACs.  (iTunes and the iPod support AAC, which also supports 24-bit sound at MP3 bitrates.)  Even though the key is advertised as 16 Gigs, it contains under 10 Gigs of data!  (Why not use the extra 6 Gigs for the mono versions to sweeten the deal?)    In summary, this is a must-own for any audiophile who is a Beatles fan, although it contains a few bugs that could be improved in future USB box sets.
1594488916|3.0|Reads VERY quickly and so I guess I can't say that there is no \\"there\\" there, but the story never really does develop into the subtitular tale of a detective (not sure who this refers to actually in the end) and \\"literary obsession.\\"    John Gilkey plays the role of Bartlett's villain. She spends a healthy amount of time wondering out loud if he really is a bad guy at all before settling in to the realization that he is at least a liar, though perhaps a harmless one. But, if his crimes are kind of harmless, the reader is left to wonder what the big deal is.     Certainly Ken Sanders, a bookseller (to whom the subtitle must be referring as a \\"detective\\" given his role as chair of the American Antiquarian Booksellers security committee) thinks the Gilkey's crimes are not harmless. He spends a good deal of his time chasing Gilkey's trail, with a vengeance. At times in the narration, Bartlett ponders whether Sanders is not just as obsessive and misguided as Gilkey. She is kind enough to not hit the reader over the head with the question, which she revists a few times, of which of these men \\"loved books too much?\\"    Those tensions (rare book theft as petty misdemeanor or serious offense, and the psychological Sanders versus the psychological Gilkey) become the book's driving tension. I don't think it really ever delivers in a profound way. There is also the fact that Sanders is not a detective and that Gilkey - whatever motivates him or inspires his deviance - does not seem to have anything resembling a \\"literary obsession.\\"    The biggest problem - cited in many of the \\"bad\\" reviews\\" is that Bartlett has made herself a part of not only the book, but also the case. Early in the book, the constant first person references are jarring and annoying. Instead of using her access to deliver a classic omniscient nonfiction narrative based on telling us what she discovered in interviews, she insists on telling us about the interviews themselves.     Instead of the Gilkey v Sanders storyline, the central conflict becomes her own, between wanting to get close to the story (through research and access) and becoming a part of the story (accompanying the thief to one of his past victim's shops for some sample recon). And, I couldn't help but be distracted from the story by her mismanagement of the sources she used for the story.    As a conclusory side note, I am noticing this a lot lately as narrative nonfiction takes a lot more first person reflection on board. Writers seem to find the most noteworthy parts of otherwise universally interesting stories to be their own role in or perception of those events. I point to recently-released work like Evening's Empire, Miracle Ball, and A Death in Belmont that all take on stories in which the author has some intimate personal involvement. It is not a trend that I am enjoying.
0316069906|5.0|I became a vegetarian 2 years ago because I found out exactly how animals were being raised in this country and slaughtered in this country. After that I saw no reason to give factory farms a dime of my money. It is not okay to torture any living being every second of its life just because it taste good. Books like this are rising awareness, thank you Jonathan Safron Foer.
B000AP04NI|3.0|What would you call it when a great movie is overshadowed by loud and bad music that broadcasts the message: Don't steal dvd content. I'd call it stupid. Not only that, but on my DVD player, I can't get past that message and get to the main movie, it keeps repeating this over and over. In my opinion this is a bad DVD layout. The first thing we ought to see on a DVD I've purchased myself is the menu. I can't stand the theft warning, and I loathe the previews. Please, movie industry, shape up!
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I watched the North American version (1 DVD) and enjoyed it tremendously, but didn't understand some of the scenes until I read the reviews which detailed missing parts, especially the \\"Downtown\\" scene.  I was able to get the British mini-series as shown on TV (PAL) and boy what a difference editing with a chainsaw makes!  While the one sold here is funny, the original is really the best since it provides more insight into Amanda's relationship with her boyfriend, etc., things that really didn't make sense.  I mean, he didn't seem like that much of a boor or so totally clueless in the American version.  So, if at all possible, get your hands on the complete version.  The behind the scenes short on the American version was very interesting.
B0020NH94A|5.0|Enlightening and inspiring while quite understandable for a lay person.  Jill Taylor's journey back to health speaks to the many issues surrounding healing: spiritual, positive attitude,listening to your own inner voice and the support of caring people.  After I listened to the CD version from the library narrated by the author, I wanted a copy for myself.
B000ILYYJE|5.0|I can't get enough of the Doors even after all these years. The Perception boxset if just awesome.
0679777547|4.0|The Club Dumas was a very good book that keeps you interested the whole book. This book starts off to be very confusing. In the beginning Corso, a book dealer, is speaking to an expert in novels about a Dumas manuscript. Soon Corso is contacted by a man wanting Corso to view the two other copies of The Nine Doors and compare them to his. The nine doors is a book to summon the devil and there are only 3 copies known. Corso needs to figure out if one of them is a forgery. He is in Spain and he gets attacked by a man with a scar. He needs to find out what this is all about.    The plot is based around the book The Nine Doors and the Kingdom of Shadows. It is a book that could be used to summon the Devil. This made The Club Dumas a very interesting book. The book can get slow at some points but it is worth it to keep reading. I was confused the whole story until I read the last 50 pages and then the book made sense and was amazing. The ending of the book is worth reading through any of the boring parts, which there are few of. If you have read The Three Musketeers it will help you reading this book. It has a lot to do with the plot and many of the characters make references to The Three Musketeers. Most of the characters have an obsession with books and talk about different books often. If you have a good understanding of older books it will make the story make more sense than if you did not. This book covered many subjects, love, action, religion, books and suspense. There is something in this book for everyone.     The pros of this book were that the plot was great the author gave you just enough action to make you keep reading and not get bored often. The ending was one of my favorite book endings.    The cons were that it can be a little bit slow sometimes but it is well worth it.    Overall if you are on the fence about buying this book, GET IT!!!     I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good suspense novel action and a little bit of romance to complicate it.
0786868724|5.0|I am not a hardcore reader at all. I stood in front of the book shelf and this one grabbed my attention. I picked it up because it was interesting. I opened it and the pages were cut different keeping my EXTREMELY short attention span from running away. The first page grabbed me and I couldn't let go. I thought this book was simple and thoughtful. I loved it.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is such a wonderful movie.  My 2 and 3 year old girls just love the movie and the music so much.  I'm so happy they love it like I did and still do.  Delivery was very quick and the condition of the dvds was perfect.
076790592X|5.0|I made the mistake of reading \\"Have a little faith\\" first. I will say I enjoyed both books, yet... they were EXTREMELY similar. Same message, different characters. I thought it was educational, uplifting and a must read. [[ASIN:0786868724 Have a Little Faith: A True Story]]

0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\", by Lois Lowry, is a book that when finished causes the reader to really think about the society he lives in. Jonas, the main character, lives in a society where everything is perfect. Pain, disease, and any kind of suffering has been eradicated from society. Everything is in order; no one has any worries. Except for one person, The Giver. There is one person in this perfect society who carries the burden for each and every individual. This is the person with all of the memories since the begining of time. The Giver has memories of famine, war, sickness, poverty, and many more indescribable memories especially the abortion-like process which is happening in the society. However, The Giver also has every good memory since the beginning of time such as snow, springtime, love, and the ability to smell and see color. Jonas has been chosen to be the next Receiver of Memory for the society. Along with many memories Jonas is fond of, he receives the memory of what is done to the babies after they are born if the family already has too many children. This utterly terrifies him and he plans to stop this act. When his mother brings home a baby, Caleb, and says that he will only be staying for a while, Jonas is devastated because he knows what is really happening. This profound memory and the drive to stop this horrible action takes Jonas on an journey that will change his life forever. This book shows us how important the flaws in our society are and unlikely we are to really like a perfect world. After reading this novel, the reader will have learned that a perfect world would require many sacrifices some are unwilling to give. HMJ
0439023483|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable.  I'll let you read all the other reviews because I don't have much new to say.  I will say this, I've read maybe 5 \\"five star books\\" in my life.  And I read a lot.  This is one of the few.  Definitely not only for young adults.
0790729601|5.0|Ordered Eraser on DVD 10/17 and received on October 24 (fast delivery).  This is a very action packed movie from beginning to end with great casting; very good story line.  We watched this twice on TV, but it is not shown very much, so we ordered a copy.  Thanks!
B000000132|3.0|Mildly powerful progressive melodics keep the album perched nicely between mechanized and pertinent, not exactly a fierce poker hand.
B001S86J0I|5.0|I ordered this DVD on October 17 and received on October 24 (fast service from Amazon, as usual).  The item was received in excellent (\\"New\\") condition.  My family enjoys watching Galaxy Quest - an extremely funny movie and great cast.  We had this movie on VHS, but we no longer have a VCR, so I ordered the DVD through Amazon.com.  Thanks so much!
B002X20W2E|5.0|i absolutely love this album. almost every song is my favorite. if you love the hard edgy Rihanna with some real sentiment added it to it you will love it. you can really feel how she felt. my two favorites aren't even singles so you must buy!
0790731452|5.0|A comedy spoofing an alien attack from Mars; very funny and with an all-star cast.  A Tim Burton movie the whole family can enjoy.  Thanks!
0803731094|5.0|I purchased this for my son at a toy store in Novato, CA. It was highly recommended by the young lady who works at the store. My son absolutely LOVES this book, and we have since purchased other J Donaldson books on Amazon, and continue to purchase the Gruffalo as THE perfect baby gift. My now toddler son still likes for us to read it to him. And I enjoy it myself (even if I have to read it 2 or 3 times a sitting), as its a very creative and funny story.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This is really stunning serie. Don't think it twice and pick this up. I was so impressed with the quality of this serie that i ordered Band of brothers from HBO. Remember this has lots of nudity blood and gore so send the kids to sleep before watching this. I wish there was some kind of setup that let you play a censored version of the serie while keeping the original version for the adults so all the family can enjoy a history lesson taking a look to the ancient time of Rome.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|The twists and turns make for a great ending.  One of Guy Richie's better movies.  They are definitely getting better as he goes further into the depths of talent.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great stand-alone series which includes both the unaired pilot (later released as a full-feature film) and several episodes completed, but not yet aired, when the series was cancelled. The special features are amazing and I loved the series so much that I watched it again (twice) with family and friends. I even purchased the boxed set to send as a Christmas gift.
B000002J1O|3.0|Well... i have mixed feeling now that i own this.  The sound is great.  I used to own this on tape, but it has been maybe 15 years since i have heard the studio versions of these songs.  They are all excellent - EXCEPT, man, The Battle OF Epping Forrest and After The Ordeal... these two songs are TERRIBLE!  I was showing my friend this album and after these two songs were over i was so disgusted that i took the CD off during the start of Cinema Show... I havenet played any Genesis in two + weeks since then.    Its just too bad these songs are on there... it really knocks the album down tons of notches.  I know Cinema Show is great... my fingers are crossed that Aisle Of Plenty isn't as bad as BoEF and ATO.  I'm still glad i got the cd, as tracks 1-3 & 7 are total classics.  The inclusion of BoEF and ATO insures this will never be listed in my top 25, or whatever, as they are just too much of a stain on the album - i know many consider this to possibly be their best album - not with those songs on it! (Note: the main refrain where they sing 'The Battle Of Epping Forest' is good, its the rest of the song with all the Gabriel squaking out some sort of British dry wit, talking, that makes this fairly long song unbearable - so, i suppose it could be a good song live without that middle section ruining it - i dont recall if i have heard a live version or not).    Perhaps i am more of a Phil-Genesis fan than i realized!  (Seconds Out is how i became a Genesis fan back in the late 80's).  I have a ROIO of an August '74 live lamb show that is one of my favorite musical perfomances ever, so... I do love Pete, but...    Final thoughts - this has some essential stuff on it, but be prepared to possibly be disgusted or at least disappointed by a couple of the tracks on this album.
B0012GMUPO|3.0|\\"Trash\\" is not Alice Cooper's best but it's immensely enjoyable nonetheless. A reviewer here has pointed to the fact that Mr. Cooper hangs his head in shame on the cover while delivering unabashed \\"Trash\\". I find that pretty funny as it may actually contain quite a bit of truth. Alice Cooper is not a very complicated musician lyrically speaking but his endless diversified quest in finding a right sound has produced some very memorable albums. At this point in his career he was having a tough time getting a hit single so he enlisted a hit maker (Desmond Child) to aid him in that respect. Also here are artists Joan Jett, Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Steven Tyler, who by the way had all been a bit influenced by the Coop, helping Cooper get to the top of the charts. IT WORKED.     On this album there are at least two classics; \\"Poison\\" and \\"Bed of Nails\\". Numbers like \\"Spark in the Dark\\", \\"House of Fire\\", \\"Only My Heart Talkin'\\" and the title track go down really well and overall this is a fine Cooper album, although a bit more shallow than usually.     I treasure this album as it helped the Coop get visible again and he needs not hang his head in shame as far as I'm concerned.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|I took my 4-year-old and 7-year-old girls to see this at the theater. It is great that the movie teaches that you can't get what you want from just wishing on a star. The movie has outstanding visuals, too, and many funny moments. IMO, however, many of the songs are just so-so. Both of my daughters absolutely loved it, more than Enchanted, more than Sleeping Beauty and more than Snow White. For my kids it ranks up there with Beauty and the Beast.

B000NU2CY4|5.0|Now I'm not saying the image quality is perfect. There are halos around the characters and little strands of hair in some scenes. Image enhancement has obvisouly been used. Is it as horrible and distracting as some people make it out to be? Far from it in my case.    I was blown away by the level of clarity showcased in this movie. Every fine detail in a characters face, in the architecture of the sets and city shots, every little rock in the dirt, every bit of detail I want to see pop out on the screen is gloriously there, something sadly missing from most Blu-Ray's released.    Those who claim it looks no better than a DVD are simply fooling themselves. The difference was almost Night and Day for me, especially after comparing the two formats, even upconverted.    If it hadn't been that I happen to work at a video store and could take the Blu-Ray home to see for myself, I wouldn't have bothered buying it going by what the people on here and other sites have said. Well, I did end up buying it and it's one of my favorites in my collection.
B00005JMJG|4.0|One of the most beautiful romances...a true journey to find/keep those memories or real life events occuring from being erased.      I read an article from Alex Sandell that said, \\"Even if love is nothing more than a chemical reaction and string of random memories, it is indeed real.  It's only when you decide to erase what makes love what it is -- the memory of love itself -- that love turns into nothing more than flowery words scribbled out on Hallmark cards.\\"     The movie was creative and done beautifully by Michel Gondry and the story is nconventional, but a love story nevertheless that reminds you that \\"there's no such thing as unconditional love, but conditional love is more than enough.\\"

B001AVCFJM|4.0|I am a big Star Trek fan and enjoyed this movie once I got over the fact that there were more special effects than story.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I will not write a book. Others here have done that.      I will just tell you I have done blind A/B listening comparrissons with the 16 bit box set tracks and the difference is obvious. The extra 8 bits allows a better, more faithful reproduction of the volume levels in the tracks and, as a result, there is an openness that some said was missing on the box set's 16 bit tracks.    These 24 bit tracks have a wider dynamic range. It's obvious, just looking at the waveform and swapping A/B with the 16 bit track, but the proof is in listening. In a blind A/B test, with someone else flipping back and forth between the two on the same song, I was able to pick out the 24 bit every time. 10 times out of 10.      The improvement is obvious and worth having. This is the best digital representation of the Beatles catalog available. It isn't a huge improvement over the Stereo Box Set (2009), but it IS an improvement and for some, that's all that matters.
B001B7CNXI|1.0|Miami Vice is a great movie but don't waste your money on the Blu-Ray version.    I'm not sure if it's because the movie is filmed with a 'dark' theme but the HD is worthless.  In fact, I put my regular Mice dvd in my Blu-Ray player and parts of it looked better.

It is a tribute to writing wrapped inside mystery and darkness. It creates a reality that rides on the margins of reality.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|This is far and away the worst video transfer of a movie to DVD that I have ever seen.  I own over 1600 DVDs.  I've never seen a more poorly executed video transfer.  What does that mean?  The dark (and moody) scenes that appear shadowed and contrasted on a 30 foot screen show up as a black, blank screen, extremely low-definition as if my 32\\" high-resolution television screen had just been turned off.  No, I don't have to change the contrast setting on my television for my other 1600 odd DVDs, and I am not about to change those settings for this one movie!<br /><br />I am only glad that Walmart started their price war for one singular reason.  I only ended up paying $10 for this all but unwatchable (in parts) DVD.  Unfortunately, Warner Bros. doesn't really care, but you should!  When you pay good money for a DVD movie, you should expect some quality.  You won't find that here.<br /><br />I am a great fan of the Harry Potter series, both the books and the movies.  But this DVD is a great disappointment!  Buyer Beware!
B0008ENIAC|5.0|You might not be aware of it, but long before McDonald's and Wendy's built their empires, there was a little-known predecessor called Veda's Old Fashioned Hamburgers, out of the little hamlet of Santa Monica, Calif. \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a documentary about the licentious family behind the failed restaurant chain -- and it's a sad thing, too, because this take on the fast-food experience came furnished with a full-service bar! See, Veda's was kind of the New York Dolls (or The Ramones, if you're homophobic) of the mom-and-pop scene: trash-talking, back-stabbing, guns blazing; it was all there under the surface, behind the twinkling eyes and sparkling lips.<br /><br />Don't believe me? Try this on for size. When Mildred's \\"good\\" daughter dies, it's nothing more than a mere afterthought. It's a real-life Cinderella in reverse. Mildred vows never to forget the little twerp based solely on the fact that the last word Kay utters is \\"mother\\" as she is fed a lethal overdose of oxygen by a doctor who's been paid off. If Kay were allowed to continue her existence a while longer before being squashed out -- and with it, all of America's hopes to remain innocent as the last threads of Rockwellian values to which we clung become unravelled in yet another \\"punk rock\\" parallel -- her full sentence probably would have gone something like, \\"Mother, Veda will never love you because you don't own 5-star restaurants, just a silly fast-food chain.\\" Wise words, indeed.<br /><br />For no matter how much Mildred worked to wash herself clean of her fast-food taint, no matter how many barons and dandies she swallowed up on her way to a White Castle in the sky, her eldest daughter Veda resented the Styrofoam empire her mother had built for her, and hit the road to be a showgirl, if you know what I mean.<br /><br />So when you eat your next hamburger, don't think about how it's mostly just spinal shavings sprinkled with \\"meat-tasting\\" magic dust fashioned by chemists at MIT. No, think about how you will never, ever connect with your children (unless you were born with a silver spoon sticking out of your mouth and it's still there when they pop out) because they will leave the nest as soon as they can out of shame, and probably ruin your marriage in the process.<br /><br />Cue sunset. Roll sweet music.connect with your children (unless you were born with a silver spoon sticking out of your mouth and it's still there when they pop out) because they will leave the nest as soon as they can out of shame, and probably ruin your marriage in the process.

B002Y5210G|5.0|Must listen must buy must see in concert!    I own every single Alicia Keys album and it seems like with each and every new album she grows more as an artist...is that possible even? Most artists usually start with a bang and at their peak then decline...her first album \\"Songs in A Minor\\" was so good that it made you think it can only go down from here.  Remember she was grammy nominated (and may have even won...cant remember?) Then \\"The Diary of Alicia Keys\\" came out and had just an uncanny number of hits on it...made me think again...wow she cant get any better....then \\"As I Am\\" came out and As I Am was a celebration of love with Reckless Love and A Teenage Love Affair And Nobody....once again just another compelling album.  So here I am again today saying WOW Did you Really do it again Alicia?    I Agree with the previous review to the concept of this album...this is not a love celebration album...this album is about how dangerous love can be and how it can be your disease...as stated in \\"Love is my Disease\\" I have to say the first song on the album (not the intro) Love is Blind is just a wonderful song. It sounds like Alicia is a little hurt/heartbroken on this album and her emotion really comes through in the songs.  She is just so soulful...she's an old soul in a young persona...she's way ahead of her time. Love the concept to this album love the variety of different tracks showing her pain and her happiness....love the tracks that encourage people to keep their heads up and the tracks where she's hurt make you feel her pain too.  I always thought the best artists can make you feel their emotion with them.  She definitely does    Cant beat the $3.99 Amazon Price!    Best tracks on the CD for me are (everything really)  Love is Blind  Doesn't Mean Anything  Wait Till You See My Smile (very uplifting)  Like The Sea  How It Feels to Fly  Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down
B002H3EUA4|1.0|I bought the 20th anniversary addition thinking the dvd was getting an overhaul, plus all the cool extras, I was wrong. Its the same 2003 version just with a different picture on the disc and dvd cover and for 31$ thats not worth it. All the extra stuff is cool and so is the tin, but to reissue the same disc with no extras just isn't very cool, especially when I already own the 2003 special edition. So save your money and buy the 2003 version or upgrade to Blu Ray.

B000QZTNQ6|5.0|Wintersun has really made a name for themselves with only one album, and that album is Wintersun.  While Jari Maenpaa is currently working hard (I hope) on the follow up \\"Time\\", I really don't care, since this one self titled album has placed Wintersun in the upper echelon of metal, with its precise musical excecution, and awsome multi-layered vocals.  Wintersun is perhaps one of the best compositions of all times, placing Jari with the likes of dare I say Mozart, or Bach.  This blows away Jari's former band Ensiferum; who are one of the elite Pagan, or Viking Metal acts; with better songwriting, composition, and classic metal performances.<br /><br />  Beyond the dark Sun kicks it of with a quick introduction of new melodic death metal meets neo-classical music.  Winter Madness, and Sleeping stars continue the mood with punishing, yet melodic riffs, and classical arrangements.  Then Battle Against Time picks it up a notch, and really helps culminate the mood for the whole album.  If you liked the first two Ensiferum albums, these first songs really will \\"deliver the goods\\" for you, and yet differentiate themselves from both Viking Metal, as well as Melodic Death, placing Wintersun in a metal subgenre all their own.<br /><br />  Starchild is maybe the best metal song ever recorded, with fast and presice drumming, intense picking, and wicked vocals, plus the sheer rockin' factor that metal was founded on.  It also has very progressive rock tendancies, much like the rest of the album, which is one of the qualities that makes this CD work so well.<br /><br />  I love the song Beautiful Death more than any on the album, for what reason I do not know.  It simply reaches me.  Life is just a beautiful death.  For some reason it penetrates my soul.  I think of my grandpa Julian, who passed on seven years ago, and left a legacy through dozens of grandkids, and great-grandkids(I wish I could say, \\"all of which loved Wintersun\\").<br /><br />  But the album as a whole shines, and establishes itself as probably the best metal release of the first decade of the twenty-first century.  Great metal, great composition.

While it does not get to in depth, it is my belief that the author does a good job of taking the reader far enough in terms of financial terminology that he does not loose them, but makes it interesting nonetheless.  I would have to say I am not normally a fan of such books, but I found it hard to put this one down.  I was interested from the start.  The author wrote this in such a way that the reader can try to relate and/or remain interested throughout.  I would recommend this read to both financial and non-financial types as well as anyone interested in learning more about the event.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|Let me start this off by making it clear that I'm not like most others that would be reviewing a Pink cd or concert video.<br />I am a middle-aged man in my 50s. I'm not exactly her demographic and I'm not a dirty old man either. I'm a retired musician and still make a buck or two as a writer and I wrote Pink off as another of the cookie cutter pop princesses that have littered the music business ever since Madonna first got watered down by Brittany Spears. Then I heard/saw the video for \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and realized that she was anything but cookie-cutter. It was her Declaration of Independence from what the music industry wanted her to be. I bought the cd the next day and heard \\"Family Portrait.\\" From that point on I was a fan. Good music is hard to find and Pink makes some VERY good music.<br /><br />Now, on to the Blu-Ray concert. It doesn't look like Pink knows what she wants to be when she grows up. The first handful of songs she performs are in the standard diva mode we've seen from hundreds of others from Cher on down. With a big flashy stage and a heavily choreographed dance troupe she bounces and bops through some pretty generic modern dance music. In the midst of this is \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" and another of her big hits, \\"Just Like a Pill.\\" Although the original rock arrangement sneaks in here and there the songs are designed to get her target audience of teenaged girls jumping and happy. There isn't anything wrong with any of this section if you're in the age group that likes that sort of thing. Understand, it's just not the sort of thing I'm into. It's also the sole reason I docked the video the 1/2 point in my subject header.<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br />No matter how old you are - even if you're an old coot \\"enduring\\" this video with your kids or grandkids, DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM. There is an absolutely gorgeous extended piano movement that is placed to allow Pink time for a costume change. When she re-emerges the pianist (who is also the musical conductor) and the violinist join Pink for a slightly altered and riveting version of \\"Family Portrait.\\" From this point forward you are in for a rare feast to the ears and eyes. There is a very personal acoustic mini-set in which Pink plays several songs dealing with the heartache of the failure of her first marriage. They are sprinkled with some lengthy banter with the audience that is just a touch too long in parts, but the songs themselves are nothing short of gorgeous. The fact that her voice isn't pure and perfectly pitched makes the emotional tone of them all the more vital and real. As a performer myself, I wondered how she was going to be able to transition back into giving her audience more of what they came to see. She does it by a lesser-known Led Zeppelin song that interweaves gentle vocals with sudden explosions of the heavy metal that made the Zep legendary. She handles the very difficult transitions in vocals extremely well, doing Robert Plant proud, disappearing during the final extended solo for another costume change. From that point forward she and the band kick into high gear. As others have mentioned, she does indeed perform \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" in its entirety only unlike Queen, she and the band remain on stage and sing through the very difficult operatic central section. The song is subtly enhanced with some of Queen's original vocal tracks but the live singers MORE than hold their own. Just when you begin to wonder if Pink isn't human at all, her voice breaks for a brief moment toward the end. She smiles over at the drummer with a brief, \\"what can you do\\" look and then finishes the song perfectly. Almost any other performer would have been finished at that point, knowing they'd taken it as far as they could. Pink is literally still getting warmed up.<br /><br />In addition to kicking up the energy even further, you should keep in mind that Pink also (well harnessed because of insurance requirements) executes a fairly intricate single trapeze act some 25 feet above the floor WHILE SINGING. Although lip synching is rampant amongst female vocalists nowadays, Pink does NONE of it. You can hear her gasping for breath as the songs and athletics progress. She even tosses off a joking threat that she's going to start lip synching so she can do 9 shows a week with matinees.<br /><br />The lady performs for almost 2 solid hours and never once lets up. Her voice only falters once or twice during the entire night and more than once she performs lengthy acrobatics high above the stage and audience. This is a woman at the absolute peak of her performance capacity and she is one of the few people I've ever seen that could pull a show like this off once, let alone for an entire world tour.<br /><br />The extra features range from being valuable glimpses behind the scenes to a somewhat silly explanation of the history of \\"shredding the nar.\\" (Pinkspeak for playing face-melting guitar) Make no mistake. This lady is an artist at a time when most of her contemporaries are either complete studio-enhanced frauds or so self-obsessed with their own talents that they become intolerable. Pink is the real deal and (despite some four-letter language in her lyrics that might make you a little careful viewing the show around small children) this concert video is worth three times what you will pay for it. I don't care if you're a young teen lion or one of the tame and toothless tabby-cat baby boomers, this blu ray concert joins Stop Making Sense and The Last Waltz as one of the three absolute best concert videos on the market. It is a MUST see.<br /><br />So is Pink a teeny-bop pop icon or a hard-edged rock queen that will help bring back the rock sound that has been dead for well over a decade? I don't think she knows. She shows both personalities at various points in the show.<br />I'm convinced that she doesn't know what she'll be when she grows up.<br /><br />After watching her talent, athleticism and musical diversity in this concert I deeply hope she never finds out.HILE SINGING.

B00008FYEH|5.0|Best remembered as the frontman for British pop phenomenon Frankie Goes to Hollywood, singer Holly Johnson was born February 9, 1960 in Liverpool; in 1977 he joined the short-lived Big in Japan, and after issuing a pair of solo singles, \\"Yankee Rose\\" and \\"Hobo Joe,\\" he formed Frankie Goes to Hollywood in 1980. Buffering their epic, opulent dance-pop with a brilliant marketing campaign highlighted by a series of provocative videos and sloganeering T-shirts, Frankie remains one of the '80s' quintessential bands, although their success proved short-lived and never really translated across the Atlantic; rising to superstardom on the strength of the singles \\"Relax,\\" \\"Two Tribes,\\" and \\"The Power of Love,\\" their 1984 debut Welcome to the Pleasuredome was also well-received by the press, but the group's fall was as meteoric as their rise; after a disastrous 1986 effort, Liverpool, they disbanded. Johnson then spent the next several years locked in a court battle against label ZTT, ultimately winning his artistic freedom; he returned to music in 1989 with his solo debut Blast, which topped the UK charts. Dreams That Money Can't Buy followed two years later, around the time the openly-homosexual singer discovered he'd contracted HIV, a subject frankly detailed in his 1994 autobiography A Bone in My Flute. Also a successful painter, in 1996 Johnson exhibited his work in London; forming his own record label, Pleasuredome, in 1999 he issued his third LP, Soulstream. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide    Content provided by All Music Guide Copyright © 2008 All Media Guide, LLC
B0009ML238|5.0|Over the last 3 years, CM has become one of my favorite melodic prog bands. To come out of the chute with a freshman effort like this - and then to follow up with ISOLATE - well...that's something.    Topnotch talent, wonderful composition and soundscapes, exciting guitar work.     Vocals - yes!! A unique voice. While I believe he's been trying to \\"find himself \\" vocally (here, he conjures elements of Steve Walsh and Geddy Lee, to name a few -- and in YouTube club gig videos, you can hear him learning to pace himself so he can pop up to his high notes night after night - a rite of passage for all singers when they tour and play a lot)... his lyrics, phrasing, and chops show he's a rising star with the power, range, and fluidity to play in the ballpark with the likes of Russell Allen and Mac McDermott.    Can't wait for their third release!  This is an album (yep - I said it, too!) which will get YEARS of play around my house.

B0002NRQTS|4.0|This album marks a return to guitar-driven music for Rush, and also marks their most consistent set of songs in some time. This album does not contain a track that one would call a Rush \\"essential\\", nor would someone buy it looking for some huge Rush hits; however, there is no \\"filler\\" either - every song is moderately strong. Presto is both consistent (in quality) and diverse (musically), and this makes it very enjoyable when you want to listen to a whole album.    Standout tracks include the African beat \\"Scars\\" (could have been Rush's only dance track ever if they had wanted to market it that way); the intense ballads \\"The Pass\\" (which deals with teen violence and/or suicide) and \\"Available Light\\" (which has a piano lead); the pop-metal hit \\"Superconductor\\"; and the musically intense \\"Chain Lightning\\" and \\"Show Don't Tell\\".    This is also the last Rush album to really touch on teen issues (in \\"The Pass\\" and \\"War Paint\\"), yet even here, it is from a more \\"grown up\\" perspective than such oldies as \\"Subdivisions\\", \\"Analog Kid\\", or \\"Circumstances\\".    The lyrically creative \\"Anagram\\" is a fun little gem. It uses anagrams/partial anagrams in a clever and engaging way. Opening lyrics: \\"There's a snake coming out of the darkness/Parade from paradise\\" (The letters in the word \\"snake\\" come out of the word \\"darkness\\"; \\"Parade\\" gets its letters from the word \\"paradise\\", and so on).    Musically, this album charts a new direction for Rush, or perhaps begins a return to more basic rock form. Synthesizers have (happily) been put back to the background where they belong, and are even replaced by piano on a couple of tracks. There is also a healthy dose of acoustic guitar layering, which adds to the texture of many of the tracks.    The only song I really don't care for is the alarmist \\"Red Tide\\", which is a fear-dealing look at environmental and disease issues. Musically \\"Red Tide\\" is well-crafted, but the \\"This is not a false alarm...\\" refrain, while certainly catchy, is alsoa bit preachy.    As far as the production, this album was originally a little \\"thin\\" sounding, but the remaster certainly helped improve the sound quality.     Overall, I really enjoy this album, especially when I want to listen to a whole album.
B00003CXC7|3.0|I LOVE Hitchcock. But perhaps I watched this movie with the wrong expectation. What I expected was a nail-biter. The truth is I only felt nervous/fearful in the last 15 minutes of the movie. It felt long, and the climax was over too quickly. Not a satisfying payoff to all the waiting.    It is very interesting as a drama. (Fantastic for watching human behavior and for the little storylines of the neighbors.) As a suspense film, though, not scary enough.

The approach to music that they use is so wonderful, I can't really put it to words.  I play guitar, bass, drums, some piano, etc... and this music makes me just want to give-up because I know I'll never be nearly as good as Jamiroquai is.  I've even considered taking dancing lessons just so I can dance to this music and know that I won't look ridiculous.  Listen to the samples.  If you like what you hear, BUY THIS ALBUM!

0810979772|5.0|My son has read and re-read and re-re-read all of the Wimpy Kid books. He likes the idea of writing and this book keeps him doing it. I pulled the book off the shelf today and found that he had been keeping a sporadic journal - \\"don't call it a diary\\" - for months. While this book is probably only 1/4 full of pre-printed stories, the pages of blank, lined paper are well worth the cost.

0823015017|5.0|This is a gorgeous book that addresses one of the major frustrations of polymer artists:  use of color.  It's exactly what I have been looking for.  The work is inspirational and unusual.  If you want to make refrigerator magnets, don't buy this book.  If you are an experienced polymer clay person, get this book now.  It's amazing.  Thank you, Lindly and Maggie.
0452295548|5.0|I had already read My Stroke of Insight by Jill Bolte Taylor, PhD.  It was a library loan and I wanted to have that book on hand almost like a handbook on how to treat anyone who had a stroke.  So I ordered three books, with the idea to give two away at Christmas.  Got the package in no time.  Well wrapped.  No problem.  Prompt delivery.  Meanwhile, I've read another book, Don't Leave Me This Way, by Julia Fox Garrison, which tells of a right brain stroke, whereas Bolte's was left brain.  Both books made me realize I've got to watch my blood pressure, though those two strokes were aberrant ones indeed, hitting either at 37 years old, and caused by other than high blood pressure or a blockage.  Their varied experiences teaches much, and should be required reading for anyone treating or helping a stroke patient.
B001PKHS68|5.0|This is another movie I absolutely adore.  I don't think it has been released yet because I haven't received it yet.  But I'm not worried.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Phantom of the Opera--I enjoyed this movie, considerably more than the Broadway and theater versions. Somehow, from the movie, I understood in a deeper sense the plot of the play.<br /><br />I could emphasize with the Phantom, the poor disfigured creature and his hopeless love for the young Christine Daae. I could say, \\"Poor Phantom\\", while still not wanting him to get the girl.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum, actually about 18 years old herself, played the 16 year old Christine beautifully, both in terms of acting and operatic voice.<br /><br />The climax of the film was touching indeed. Her terminally ill husband lays flowers on her grave. He is struck by the flowers and ring, obviously deposited by the Phantom, still alive and still grieving himself for his lost love, Christine.<br /><br />Although Phantom has been acclaimed for its music, I found the score so-so. It was the depth of the plot that got me. In another film, Billy Crystal expressed his disdain for the Phantom's live theater musical version, paraphrasing as follows:  \\"This guy has a mask, covering his pizza for a face. The main melody of the play is a copycat version of `School Days, School Days.'\\" Maybe it was plagiarized, but in the film version, I didn't mind one bit.

B002JCSWUW|5.0|Rugby has never been well publicized in the US. Soccer, although not a ranking sport, receives far more publicity. Therefore, it was knowledge-expanding and stirring to observe the underdog South Africa team's road to a 1995 Rugby cup victory.<br /><br />The accompanying plot, of course, was the work of Nelson Mandela in using this victory and its team preparation to try to unify South Africa. From our own trip in 1994, when the country was just opening up, we had an idea that there was much unrest and volatility. The nation was still racially divided, although the Apartheid enforced by a distinct white minority had just ended.<br /><br />Mandela has never received credit for the job he did in keeping South Africa's peace, while trying to encourage foreign investment. He saw that merely seizing white-owned businesses and infrastructure would only be looting of a fixed amount of wealth. No growth could result from the types of activities that were occurring in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, where white minorities had been ousted from power.<br /><br />As the new President of South Africa, representing an overwhelming black majority, Mandela took a long term view of what was needed. He alienated a considerable portion of his own party to implement his program of racial reconciliation.<br /><br />The movie provides an exceptional, well integrated blend of sports and far-seeing political strategy.<br /><br />Some critics have heaped praise on Invictus, claiming that this represents director Clint Eastwood's work \\"at the top of his game.\\" Other critics have carped about what they see as \\"trite\\" dialog. Perhaps if Mandela had been ranting against his racist predecessors and, even more, against the US, they would have enjoyed the dialog more. One critic claimed that too much artistic license was taken in portraying actual events of Mandela's interaction with the rugby team and its captain. These objections seem trivial.<br /><br />Others have predicted that Morgan Freeman, in his role of Mandela, is a strong Oscar candidate. I hope that Invictus receives a potful of other rewards as well.<br /><br />With all the negative, tragic outcomes of recent history and, of course, today's events, it was refreshing and stirring to see the rugby success of the South Africa team. More to the point, it represented a hopeful outcome for the nation as a whole.e. I hope that Invictus receives a potful of other rewards as well.

B002M27QQK|4.0|This deluxe \\"art book\\" package of Lady Gaga's \\"The Fame Monster\\" IS very nice, and is worth it for collectors, but I agree, they should have used this set as a golden opportunity to domestically release the 3 international bonus tracks...\\"Disco Heaven\\", \\"Again Again\\", and \\"Retro Dance Freak\\" (are there more songs I don't know about??), maybe the Christmas sex track \\"Christmas Tree\\" in proper CD form, cool import-only remixes, and NON-edited versions of the songs...there could have also been a DVD of all her videos to date included, as well as unreleased live footage??<br /><br />Personally, I'd buy the Japanese edition of TFM first for the bonus tracks, and unedited versions, and if I see this set at a reduced price later on, I might spring for it...as what's included is pretty cool...but extra songs to me are more important than a lock of 1 of Gaga's wigs, paperdolls and puzzles.<br /><br />Again, nice package, but it'll be for later...cheers!!
B000AYQLX6|5.0|WOW!.... I guess it was great with yoko gone!  no surprise!  This is really John at his solo best. The back up band on most of these tracks were really tight and were great players! I'm a strong lennon fan, and I never saw until recently what a great CD this one really is...  If your wondering why the drums on YA YA are a little off?  that was Julian his son I think at 4 or 5 years of age playing drums... also yoko took out may pangs vocal on #9 dream and put her own in....YEAK! Truly don't pass this one up!
B002RSDW80|2.0|If you want to watch whiny, privileged, generic white liberals talk while they stuff their mouths with food - then this movie is for you.  Overly precious, self conscious, annoying.  Comes complete with the cliched \\"lunch date\\" in which the idealistic, oh-so-cute protagonist realizes that her friends are all greedy, narcissistic phonies!  She then goes home to complain to her hyper-supportive, eunuch of a boyfriend and a dream is born.  Makes me wonder if the book is this bad.

The booklet is quite elaborate with linernotes written by the band, all the lyrics are included and very beautiful artwork that fits right in with the theme.

B0000033TE|4.0|Brain Salad Surgery being ELP's 4th studio album and their 1973 release and is a fine example of progressive rock. The album can also be said to have experimental rock elements to it. The sound reminds me quite a bit of The Who, Yes and even early Kraftwerk before they went all electronic. Allmusic gave this album 4/5 and this is also my grade. 4/5.
B002NXSRW0|3.0|I have to start this review by saying I was a huge GI Joe fan growing up, first the cartoon and later the comic. So any change to the series I remember so fondly is tough. They had to run a fine line with this movie, appeal to those who loved and know GI Joe, while appealing to those who just wanted to see a good movie. I think the biggest problem I had with Rise of the Cobra is they tried to do too much with it. It is a fine line to create a movie based on a much loved and nostalgic comic/cartoon and do it in a modern way. I am all for updating and even a change in continuity if it helps the series and over all story, but I didn't get that from Rise of the Cobra. What I saw was a poor story, over acting, under acting and so much scene chewing it made me hungry and I had to make a trip to the lobby. The biggest issue is they took away so much of what made GI Joe unique. Forced multiculturalness, drastic changes to beloved characters, and the inability to tell if they wanted to make an action movie or a comedy. They had good actors and a lot of money to make this, with a better story and better direction this could have been great. If you haven't seen it yet I'd say to pass and if you really want to see an updated and adult version of GI Joe, then the animated GI Joe Resolute does the job so much better than this mess. Too bad really, I wanted nothing more than to write a review about how awesome this movie was, but it just isn't very good.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Saw this film in theaters and loved it. Great on DVD, loved the extras. The outtakes were great. Haven't heard the commentary yet but I'm looking forward to that too. There's a nifty behind-the-scenes discussion of how the producers/directors envisioned the film, great insight into what ended up in the theaters. Spock and Kirk's characters were wonderfully developed - hope to see similar development with McCoy in future films.
1416955070|3.0|City of Bones is a pretty straightforward action based teenage novel with a few uptight demon hunters as stars. It's a pretty easy read with a few surprises, and not too much teenage angst, which is definitely a good thing. Unfortunately, the main characters are all shallow, the demon hunters especially, and the plot is a little too simple. One event clearly leads to another, with only one or two surprises along the way. When someone is kidnapped the main characters go find them. When someone's memories are blocked they use a name that pops up to go unblock the memories, and so on. The relationships aren't very meaningful and the romance isn't very interesting, but all in all it's a nice, well put together, quick read. Not necessarily interesting enough to continue in the series, but I'm not sorry that I read it.
B0000D96NW|4.0|Through the Ashes of Empires being Machine Head's 5th studio album and their 2003 release is a great mix of groove metal and thrash metal. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with photographs and a list of whom plays what. Allmusic gave this release 4/5 and I somewhat agree. I wish I could give 3.5 but since I can not then 4 it is. I really dislike the photographs. They look like a friend has shot them and not like a professional photographer. 4/5.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brother is bar none the best war series ever produced. Saving Private Ryan was a great movie but only so much can be told in two hours. The ability for characters to develop and grow requires time and that is what Band of Brothers give you. You will see the highs and lows of war, you will see comradely develop between men who become closer than brothers. The acting is fantastic, the setting is great and the writing is spot on. This is the best series about war ever, any war, bar none. You will find yourself feeling the same highs and lows as the characters you grow to understand on the TV. Having been off to war a time or two this series really hits home. Combat no matter the time or war is brutal, you see the best of man and the worse and this series captures that like no other. I highly recommend this not just to the war movie/TV show fan, but to anyone. No one should ever forget the sacrifice made my our forebears to free the war of tyranny. A great series, you will not be disappointed in it.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Ingmar Bergman has really changed the way I look at film.  He was a brilliant master of cinematic marvels and he really challenged the viewer with every film.  `Persona' is probably one of his most widely acclaimed and most widely discussed films, and for rightful reasons.<br /><br />This film speaks to me.<br /><br />The plot is simple (at least on the outset).  Elisabeth Vogler is an actress who, for no apparent reason, decided partway through a performance to remain silent and she has been hospitalized because of it.  Alma, a young and naïve nurse, has been commissioned to care for her.  The two women are relocated to a small seaside house where Alma will attempt to break Elisabeth of her muted condition.  When alone though, these two women begin to clash.  Mentally they start to break one another down, frustrated and impatient and stubborn they start to attack one another (especially Alma as her frailty starts to unravel).<br /><br />The film is not given a clear conclusion, but that doesn't take anything away from you've experienced.  It actually helps to watch the film multiple times, for it is with each viewing that one can dissect and uncover the core of this very poignant and powerful expos&eacute; on human mentality and illness.<br /><br />With brash directorial touches, Bergman blurs the lines between character developments to expose a truth we strain to see.<br /><br />Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann are flawless here.  This is Andersson's movie, despite this being Elisabeth's story.  As Alma, Andersson carries the bulk of the films dialog, and she handles each scene rather effortlessly.  Even when discussing weighty subjects (her erotic encounter is just brilliant) she has this natural tone, an ease that helps establish her remarkable comfort with Elisabeth.  Although silent, Liv really transcends that silence and delivers a very moving performance.  Bergman always pushed his actors to deliver with minor facial movements to really convey feelings and emotions that were not dependant on words.  Liv's dynamic performance is proof of that.<br /><br />If you are willing to climb inside your mind and explore what may not be most comfortable, then `Persona' is a film for you.  With startling images (the opening scenes are rather abrasive and shocking) and a subtle yet complex plot, `Persona' has everything a film needs to make an impact.<br /><br />And what an impact it makes!v's dynamic performance is proof of that.    If you are willing to climb inside your mind and explore what may not be most comfortable, then `Persona' is a film for you.

I almost don't know what to say............but never let it be said that Bob is not full of suprises
B001IUBZAU|3.0|Black Ice being AC/DC 15th studio and their 2008 release is a standard hard rock and heavy metal light release that one has heard many times before and whilst it is not bad it is not all that interesting either. The booklet contains no lyrics but a bunch of photographs of the band and a list of whom plays what. Allmusic, The Guardian and Blender gave the album 3/5 and I agree with this. Compared to great releases like Back in Black this is not nearly as good but then again not a terrible release. 3/5.
B00006B1HH|5.0|A supurb movie.    In FULL SCREEN my television can utilize 100% of the picture tubes pixells to provide the sharpest image of this film on a standard definition NTSC set.    I would have liked to have \\"Grease2\\" but alas, it's only avaliable in widescreen which turns off 60% of the available number of pixells to produce an image.
B000EHSVS2|3.0|Some films, no matter how great they `were', just don't hold up over time.  I'm sure that, at the time of its release, `Patton' was a stellar film.  In fact, I know it was.  The film won seven Academy Awards (although, I know of a recent Oscar winning film that wasn't stellar upon its release, so I guess the Oscar's are not the perfect judge of quality) and has been hailed as one of the best biographical war movies of all time.<br /><br />I don't know, to me, it just felt `cheap'.<br /><br />Despite a blisteringly good performance by George C. Scott (I really love this guy as an actor, for he can really do just about anything), the film falters for me in scope and construction.  While the development of Patton himself is quite good, I found that everything going on around him felt cluttered, sloppy, confusing, rushed and, well, cheap.<br /><br />And I totally understand the detractors that call this movie boring, for at nearly three hours it does ride at a slow pace for the most part.<br /><br />While I am not a huge fan of war films to begin with, I am a very big fan of the biopic and an even bigger fan of the slow, brooding character study.  Sadly, even my patience was tested in parts.  Some films really stretched themselves and delivered something that was `ahead of its time'.  `Patton' is the type of film that feels outdated by the time the decade was over.  It feels like a poorly made `Television Movie' to me, and that is never good.<br /><br />When you consider the types of war films that came out in the late 70's you have to wonder why this particular film wasn't...better.<br /><br />Still, George C. Scott is a marvel here, and his performance does elevate the film in many areas.  As much as I wanted to end my viewing early on many occasions, it was Scott who kept me glued to the television.  `Patton' is far from a great film (as one friend once said to me, great movies are the ones that `hold up' over time) but it sports an astonishing performance and does carry with it some intriguing history.  It is a film that is worth watching at least once.  I understand good and well that entertainment and the enjoyment it brings is purely subjective, and our own personal situations, emotional crutches and whatnot all play a big part in what we find enjoyable, moving and shapes what we consider masterpieces.  So, I totally understand why so many adore this film.<br /><br />I hope that you can understand why I didn't.ilm that is worth watching at least once.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|Finally, we have some jokes about physicists. Good to know that some years studing physics can cause some typical behavior. The Big Bang Theory is about our believes and difficulties to handle the routine. Relationship with friends and lovers. It is extremely well based with perfect references to modern Physics.     Unforgeable to see a couple arguing about how to grow up the kids, if using Standard Model of Particles or Super Strings. Religion is replaced by Physics critizing the society. Perfect parallell.

B00003CXSM|1.0|I love Jennifer Lopez.  I don't particularly find her a drop-dead knock out like everyone else (she is attractive, but not my cup of tea), and I don't really think she is the greatest actress out there (I foresee NO Oscars in her future) BUT, and this is a HUGE but, she is so likeable and charming and just effortlessly captivating.<br /><br />I LOVE WATCHING HER!<br /><br />That said, when I first saw `The Wedding Planner', her captivating presence blinded me to the films flaws.  I really liked this, but truth be told, I like almost everything she does.  I mean, what isn't to like about predictable romantic comedies so familiar you could quote them before you see them YET maintain such charming chemistry with the viewer that you walk away totally refreshed and completely entertained.<br /><br />I mean, really...what ISN'T to like about that?<br /><br />Still, after a few recent viewings it becomes clearer and clearer that, despite Lopez's charm, I really don't wish to watch this one again.<br /><br />`Maid in Manhattan'; yes please.<br /><br />`Monster-in-Law'; double check.<br /><br />This predictable, preposterous mess; I don't think so.<br /><br />One of the biggest issues I have with `The Wedding Planner' is that it is SOOOOOO stupid.  It's one thing to present a premise that is predictable and `far fetched', but it is another thing entirely to insult the viewer by degrading your main characters, delivering people who appear to be just plain stupid.  The whole idea of a groom-to-be having one last potential `outing' before he ties the knot is not far-fetched.  Having that fling turn out to be your bride-to-be's hired wedding planner is stretching it a little, but believable.  Having the bride totally oblivious to everything that is obvious and (get this) TRUSTING HER GROOM AND HER PLANNER TO MAKE ALL THE DECISIONS FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF HER LIFE WITHOUT OUT is just going so far over the line that it is eye-rolling ridiculous.  I mean, forget her naivety about her grooms wavering pants, there is no way I am going to believe that a woman that neurotic about her wedding being perfect is going to let two other people plan it for her while she goes away on business.<br /><br />Stupid.<br /><br />Add to that the ridiculous Massimo sub-plot (which is drug out far too long and becomes such a stupid reminder of how clich&eacute;d and unintelligent rom-coms can be) and you have a film that lacks so much in brains it loses all charm.  It's sad, because Lopez and even Matthew (I'll never really understand his appeal) both play off one another wonderfully here.  They deserved a better script.<br /><br />Alas, they were handed a lump of mud and couldn't do anything with it.to believe that a woman that neurotic about her wedding being perfect is going to let two other people plan it for her while she goes away on business.

B000007443|5.0|I was so excited when I finally found this album available on CD after twenty-five years.  I was a sophomore in high school when this album first came out.  At first it sounded rather alien and bizzare to me, but after a few hearings I was hooked.  \\"Steps Ahead\\" remained my favorite jazz album all through high school.     All of the musicians are incredible.  And they have a very unique sound.  I think of how Eddie Gomez (the bassist) was constantly bending and warping pitch, or the way the other musicians would phase in and out of tonality.  They knew what they were doing.  This stuff was cutting edge.    On a more serious note, I have to say I was very sorry to hear that Michael Brecker (tenor saxophone) died a few years ago from leukemia.  The world lost an amazing musician.  I guess it's a sobering reminder of how frail we are, regardless of our gifts and talents.

So with this reveiw if your thinking of getting it go ahead cause for the price its a win-win it makes the music sound noticablly better and louder and its pretty cheap.

Software development, complaint management     These building blocks are laid out on a page in a very specific way, referred to as a \\"business model canvas\\". As each chapter unfolds, we get a clearer and clearer understanding of each building block and how to use them to create, evaluate and communicate business models.      The business model canvas can be used to describe any of awide variety of business models. Patterns emerge which correspond to categories of business models.  For example, the Long Tail business model is all about selling less of more.  The focus is on \\"offering a large number of niche products, each of which sells relatively infrequently\\". This pattern is illustrated with the transformation of the book publishing industry and Netflix.    Another example is the so-called \\"Freemium\\" business model used by Skype and countless other Internet businesses.  This is compared with the standard Telco model making the two models easy to compare.  A similar analysis compares the traditional computer gaming model used by Sony and Microsoft which competes on high performance with Nintendo's Wii business model which focuses on casual gamers and a dramatic reduction in development costs.  Visualizing these alternatives on a canvas is very powerful (much easier than the above lists).    The Freemium model is a special case of a more general \\"multi-sided market\\" pattern which \\"brings together two or more distinct but interdependent groups of customers\\".  For example, Google gives away a variety of services to one customer segment, the average web user, and earn income from keyword auctions from advertisers, which comprise the other side of the pattern.  As is typical with the multi-sided market pattern, the key resource is the platform which facilitates interactions between the two customer segments.      Another major section of the book is devoted to designing business models. Very explicit instructions and tips are given in the context of an overall process.  Different phases include: gathering customer insights, ideation/brainstorming, visual thinking, prototyping, storytelling and scenarios.    A major section on strategy includes a section on how to evaluate existing business models, identifying problems, and brainstorming about possible solutions.  Nintendo's Wii is featured.  One problem with the traditional gaming model is that consoles are sold at a loss to a relatively small market.  By eliminating the huge cost of gaming platform development and adding motion-controlled games with a family focus, the market grew much larger.      The design and layout of the book is equally delightful. It is a cross between a Powerpoint pitch and a regular book, and is easy and fun to read.      The only negative I can think of is the binding.  I don't know the lingo, but basically, the front and back (hard) covers are not directly connected to each other. Between them are the sewn and glued sections of the book that are normally hidden. Unfortunately, the book seems to be flimsy.  But this is a minor niggle.    Overall, this is a brilliant book.  If you have any interest in business models, get it as soon as you can.  I got mine by chance on a recent trip to Europe while visiting a colleague.  I saw that it was not available yet in the US, so he traded me for my copy of an equally excellent book: [[ASIN:0273708058 The new business road test: What entrepreneurs and executives should do before writing a business plan (2nd Edition)]].

B00192IV0O|4.0|CD's arrived on time. Eventhough disc #1 of this 2 disc set was inoperable, I would use the seller again. The replacement process was extraordinarily smooth, professional, and positive. No complaints here; things happen. It's nice to know that their response time and impeccable customer service in such cases is superb.
B000L43AN4|4.0|I'll admit I don't like every song Tom does, but this collection covers much of his range and had what I was looking for. The gritty, gruff blues hollering he does shines on the 'Bastards' CD, and Brawlers has a few good ones on it too. If you liked 'Eyeball Kid' or 'Phillipino Box Spring Hog' it's not far from it. There's also a weird poetry regarding horrible insects too which makes you feel as though you've been mentally assaulted without even knowing it. I'm not a huge fan of his softer songs which some may like on 'Bawlers,' where I continue to skip over these songs to get to the one or two good ones. He also does an Americana-type old time song too which sounds quite like an old woman. Very satisfied I added this to my collection of his older work...I just hope his voice holds out so he can continue his ballyhoo for many years to come.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|Very, very ordinary album and because of that, just poor (but maybe it's too big word). Of course, you can't say that this is the disaster, but mediocre always hurts me.<br /><br />Best songs in my opinion are \\"Like The Sea\\" and \\"Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart\\" which're representing a real good, \\"high\\" kind of pop. The rest is very unoriginal, and you really won't find there much imagination.<br /><br />I couldn't write that \\"The Element Of Freedom\\" is a big disappointment cause Alicia Keys has never excited me too much, so I didn't expect an \\"artistic mountains\\", but the impression is considerable dissatisfaction.
