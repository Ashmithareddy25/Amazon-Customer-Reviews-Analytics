B005ERYEGU|5.0|I worked for a similarly popular software company and it was enlightening  to see the similarities in how we figured out our sales model compared to how Aaron details his experiences at Salesforce.com.  What I found most useful was the way he delved into some of the &#34; nuts and bolts&#34; of building a sales machine.  I highly recommend this book for any executive building a sales org.

This is one of the few movies I put on that held my attention the entire way. Very enjoyable and suitable for the whole family. The end was not what I expected. Go rent it.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|Went to see this at the IMAX theater today. I was not disappointed. At first I thought it was just going to be a remake of Pitch Black but it was far better. Great cast of actors, great effects, great action, suspense, the whole package. FIVE STARS. Pre-ordering.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Always enjoy Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman.  Reminded me of the Moon, but less cerebral.  Good movie; I'll watch again.

B00ESY827C|5.0|I was really nervous about this, but knowing it was going to have modern music and directed by Baz Luhrmann I also knew what I was getting into to.  I do love Luhrmann's films but they can definitely be a surprise to those who are unfamiliar with him.  I was worried the modern music would ruin a classic novel that I love very much.  To the contrary, I think it was excellently done and truly expressed Fitzgerald's disillusionment with the jazz age.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Vigilante movie.  Bad guy is a drug dealer.  Cliche futuristic dystopia, feels extremely tired and out of date.  Didn't films from the 80's explore this territory?  Watch \\"Brazil\\" or \\"Robocop\\" instead, or read \\"1984.\\"  People who support George Zimmerman probably will like it.  Action flick with a lot of blood, some exploded brains, and short flashes of rape scenes.  Lead character wears a 3/4 mask, minor characters die quickly, so almost no acting.  Plot very straightforward. The pacing works, and special effects are good enough to not draw attention to themselves in a negative way. So the film is not conflicted in its artistic vision, just feels very derivative and irrelevant in 2013.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel Washington and Robert Zemeckis team up to make a movie that is way out of the common mold for both. Neither have worked together previously. It's a raw and edgy role for Denzel, but I thought it was a terrific film for all kinds of reasons; and I highly recommend seeing Flight without reviews or spoilers (such as follow this paragraph) for maximum impact. Just the fact that Denzel is in it should be enough.<br /><br />Washington plays Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic, commercial airline pilot, whose plane crashes for ambiguous reasons. Though he miraculously crash lands the plane in a Georgia field, saving many lives and emerging a hero, his troubles slowly begin to mount. Airline pilots are among the most respected professions in our society, but when Washington as an icon of the public trust comes under suspicion of having piloted a flight under the influence of a drink, his life slowly falls apart.<br /><br />Any number of A-list actors could have turned down a role such as this, which probes the fundamental weaknesses of a man under the influence of an addiction. But Denzel picks up the mantle of a character full of contradictions, and delivers a fully-fleshed, depressing yet fascinating story of a man in crisis.<br /><br />There is also a parallel story of a heroin-addicted woman, played by Kelly Reilly, who manages to pull herself out of a death spiral, while also watching Captain Whitaker go down the tubes.<br /><br />Don Cheadle and Bruce Greenwood play Whitaker's supporters from the Airline Pilots Union, who will stand by their man to the last straw, but their efforts are sorely tested by Whitaker's alcoholism. But if Cheadle and Greenwood are the angels on Whitaker's right shoulder, Harling Mays as Whitaker's coke dealer (John Goodman) is perched on Whitaker's other shoulder, ready to lead him into a paradise of vice, injecting massive doses of humor into the film's most tense moments.<br /><br />The film seems a bit long, but as the story drove on to its last third, I was totally absorbed in what was going to happen next. Will Whitaker fly to Jamaica and escape his legal troubles? Will the airline be found negligent because pilots are forced to fly stressful schedules?<br /><br />Denzel's willingness to take on roles that probe the inner crisis of a middle-aged man demonstrate great flexibility and a prolonged career path for Washington. Whitaker's aircraft and his life may be falling apart, but Flight holds together marvelously.s last third, I was totally absorbed in what was going to happen next.

B003INBNXO|5.0|Donnie Yen plays Ip Man, a renown martial arts master who is subdued and in control of his emotions.  The film takes us from his days as a well-respected and wealthy man to being a coal-worker during the Japanese occupation of China.  The film is extremely well-acted and choreographed with the martial arts action being part of the plot and not just eye candy.  This is a magnificent film that will draw you in.  Donnie yen can carry a film in a way that few martial arts actors can.  This movie will make you cheer for him.
B003M70O5O|5.0|So amazing and very addictive! Can't get enough.  We watch it every night.  Not sure what we will do when we are out of free seasons.
0064471837|5.0|Not a genre I'm generally attracted to, I was convinced to read this by my daughter, a huge fan.  I was immediately captivated by the premise and carried along on an amazing adventure into the land of the dead and back again.  Nix has created an entire universe with his imagination and used it as the backdrop for a fast moving adventure tale.<br />Our heroine, Sabriel, lost her mother at birth and has been at boarding school, visited intermittently by her father.  The magic he taught her on his visits was something she rarely thought about, having no need in her cloistered world.  Although they were close to the Old Kingdom, they shut the doors against that world. But when evil comes to her, Sabriel is forced to enter the world of death, to fight evil magic.<br />It all sounds a little odd to me, even reading my own description of this story.  But Nix has woven a tale that draws you in from the very beginning, and the book has a tone that makes it very believable, as if it isn't fantasy at all.<br />The characters are well written, fun, and interesting.  Sabriel is a smart normal girl with an amazing ability to think on her feet.  Her father, Abhorsen, seems like a wise wizard.  There is a handsome prince, not written as a handsome prince, and even a talking cat.  Creatures come and go, magic starts and stops, and there are clever tools with which to perform magic.  This is a story that draws you in from page 1 and holds you until the end.<br />Although this is considered young adult fiction, it is a book that will appeal to all ages.  The first of a trilogy, it is a great introduction (for me) to fantasy and I am looking forward to reading more.  Highly recommended for all ages.
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I didn't even open this after I got it. plus,  I sent my Kindle back.  I guess I need a note book instead

B00A8ECU24|4.0|So many people are complaining about how expensive the game is and i don't see why. Some people say Fluttershy cost way too much, but it only took me 3 days to save up 47,800 bits! You won't have a problem if you just save up your bits instead of spending TONS of money! :-P

B00D8RYV52|1.0|Have purchased almost all the dr panda apps and am VERY happy with the overall play. We were really looking forward to having this one added to our growing group.... unfortunately I can even get it opened! I tried un installing and re installing a few times.... no such luck and turning off and rebooting device! Even more disappointing is to read the other reviews and find this particular app to be a waste money and now my time!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|a little hard to stop playing once you start...after all...who doesn't want to earn enough to buy a unicorn?? cute game.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I I use this alarm clock with my kindle. It's easy to set the alarm, and you can save different alarm days and times, which I like because I have different schedules on different days. The selection of alarm music is great too. Overall, a great app...
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|As a true fan of My Little Pony, I felt this movie fit right in with the show. Although the movie was geared towards the younger fans, it still was right in line with the values of what MLP is. Two thumbs up from me.
B00C7AXJMW|5.0|Atwood proves her status as a Canadian literary icon with this moving, tragic, yet hopeful finish to the Madadam trilogy.<br /><br />This is a must read for Atwood fans.<br /><br />The trilogy is a must read for anyone with even the smallest concern for the course Western civilization is currently charting.  I hope the Madadam trilogy is not prophetic.  I fear it is.
B00D8HNR2K|1.0|This album is bad.  Stinky.  No really.  I like pretty much everything prior to some degree.  This is awful.  No redeeming qualities.

B00C7L4QB4|5.0|I recommend that you watch Silence of the Lambs again. I did this after watching the first season and appreciated the series even more.  I watched the movie when it first came out and although I thought it was a great movie, I didn't care for it very much because of how disturbing it was. I watched it again because I felt like I was missing out on some inside jokes during the series.... and I was right.  They do a very good job of keeping true to the dialog and story.  The actors in this series are amazing. Each show is creepier than the previous.  I'm enjoying the show more than the movie because there is more psychological content to keep me interested.  I think if you like serial killer stories, Criminal Minds and the like, you should give this a try.... but watch Silence of the Lambs again.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Not since the original Star Trek has there been such an awesome movie.  Great job.to see the ole Spock again was the icing on the cake.  Always wise, but so human
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I I This is the best game of hidden objects I have played in a long time!  I enjoy hidden objects games, they are my favorite.  Like this one better.

B00CBKLO52|5.0|You get 3 rc stuff when you first by it but you can buy more stuff and you will have more fun
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Page turner - but seemed rather long.  Should read before the hit to make some things make more sense.  Would<br />recommend.
B00B1ME3DQ|4.0|Defining CD for a band driven by a voice and the attitude and demeanor of that voice. Lyrically as well. A progressive step up. Guitarist and drummer really finding their strengths here. Very little slack. Tightly knit production. Some riffs seem to be reaching into the muscle zone, but still a lot of plucking and stabbing along with the drums and bass line. Overall, a fine addition. I get a sense the band wants to leave a mark -- an impression. They are getting more deliberate without tossing out the fun and games.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Myself and my family love this show. Download was easy and fast, and new episodes available withing 24 hours of broadcast
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I cannot begin to put into words how much I love every song on this album!  I've always liked his songs but never been a huge fan.  This album has changed that!  Very country vibe  - old country, not the new crap.....  Will be listening to this for years to come!
0064471837|5.0|Recommended by my cousin. Fell in love with the story, especially Mogget! Now I wanna name my next oet that, even if it's a dog! :D
B00ESY77LO|5.0|I usually have a hard time watching movies on work nights but this movie drew me in. It has great acting and a great story line, definitely a must see!
B000W91RUG|4.0|Am a big fan of the Big Bang gang.  Was surprised how 'undeveloped' the characters were in the early episodes as compared to my knowledge of them after many seasons, but was fun to see the progression over the season
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Is a great movie, I recommend if you like action and comedy together also was a good price 1.99$ can't bit that
B001U3ZYVG|5.0|So if you had to give up your record collection from your youth (darn ex-wife), this is worth picking up. What can I say about a classic album other than, pick it up on the format you first listened to it on. It sounds amazing. It'll bring back memories, sitting around listening to Janes without a care in the world. It'll be a great escape and trip down memory lane.<br />Packaging is great. Its the 180g, so it will last past your next ex-wife.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The theme in this novel was making choices, ones that were not easy to make, and those who are affected by those choices. I found myself wavering between laughing and crying.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I'm a fan of temple run, so this was a nice new adventure. Seems like they tried to put too many graphics into the background. I swear most times I feel dizzy playing from seeing all that stuff go by so quickly.
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|Great album, well worth the wait. I may have found a song for the first dance to my wedding on this album
1452110581|4.0|Another must for the crazy cat people in your life.  It was a great gag gift with some fun poems to remind us of the kitties we know and love
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie is a great compromise for two people wanting to watch a movie when one wants a comedy and the other wants an action.
B00D8HNQZI|5.0|Its nice that Reznor decided that NIN isn't done. This album proves it. The songs are great the lyrics are NIN from the past 14 years. The anger from the first albums has definitely been replaced and he keeps moving forward. The evolving of NIN while keeping its soul shows that Reznor is ready to give up or put a daggar into the back if NIN.<br /><br />All of Reznors projects from the past few years have been great. I hope he doesn't decide that NIN is worn out again. I have listened to this album several times since I recieved it and I can listen to over and over.<br /><br />The vinyl itself is great. The packaging is beautiful. It is also nice to have the cd along with it since, I had to remove the turntable from the car.<br /><br />If you are a NIN fan and love vinyl records go for it. You won't be disappointed.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Let's you have fun without having to spend tons of cash. The art is also very nice, and rounds are short enough that you can at casually.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game itself is okay, but it takes so long to &#34;load&#34; in betwen each time you run. As an adult, I was frustrated waiting - imagine a child! Wish there was a way to by-pass the starting and just get right to the running.
B001CDLATE|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor - it's really fantastic - a picture of life on this planet.  The extra features are also pretty incredible, as many of the shots will leave you wondering - how did they DO that?
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I want to talk to someone else who has read this book but then again, I don't. I believe to truly appreciate this, you have to internalize it and keep its meaning to yourself. It must have a different meaning and different impact on each of us to honor the words.<br /><br />I know that paragraph sounded like a bit of esoteric bull ****, but you have to read this to feel it. It's both blunt and beautiful and John Green, it's a gift.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|A nice way to waste some time. Not so hard as to frustrate, and makes you want to keep going. Once you get started it goes fast.
B000FC1QQU|5.0|The humor and delicacy is marvelous. This series of books is addictive. I reccomend them all enthusiastically. If you read the first one you will read them all. PBS created a delightul series out of these books. I suggest that you read them in order..
B009ZH4K0A|5.0|Talk about the great John Contrane really is daunting task trying to be one of the most important jazz saxophonists that have existed. A great and complex language, musician brings us a landmark album. Sound strong, virtuous and complex improvisation, these 7 themes are accompanied by a second version on 'alternates tracks' making us enjoy these beautiful themes and solos. A great cd without a doubt.<br />Extraordinary 'Countdown' and 'Giant Steps'.
B000HL09SA|5.0|A must see movie.  A true movie about life and the learnings we will all go through,  a great movie for adults and children.

B009OYSFDM|5.0|This was much better than I expected.  I did not watch it when it was broadcast as it sounded like it would not be good, but I was wrong.  Now I am playing catch-up before season 2 starts!
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Lots of unrealistic shootout scenes, things get blown up and bad guys get killed. What more did you expect. Bubblegum for the brain.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked like how crazy they were in the book and how willing and how much  Acton in it brick hated that gale just went of good a fansy job and left for ever not even trying to win katness back and that she married pete and not Gale how she just like forgot him after all they been through there. Like  not even friends they don't even speak I really thought she should merry gale other than the gale and Pete thing I liked it and PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER BOOK THIS IS THE ON BOOKS I WILL READ  and I'm really sad about Gale
159463176X|4.0|Successive chapters unfold very compelling portrayals of the story characters who make up the whole book. Elements of oral tradition occur throughout with deep-dish pathos that often caused a tear to come to my eye. Love how Hosseini rounds out the 1st and final chapter with the same main characters.<br />Starting off in a village in rural Afghanistan, mid 1940s, a father tells a folk tale to his two young children. On the next day, they will travel to Kabul and start a chain of events that will take the reader on a journey across the world and through the lives of several story characters.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is my favorite bingo game so far. I love the free daily tournemant! Even if you run out of chips you can still play until you get more.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I can spend hours on the slots and bingo part o  the games. My favorite part in the tournament's is the free tournie games. I have tried the blackout tournies and the high roller ones but I just keep coming back to the free games.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love this cd not disappointed at all not often do I buy a cd where I actually like all the songs but I knew I was safe with this one because Bruno Mars is so talented. If you are hesitant about this one don't be you will be absolutely satisfied.
1609611543|5.0|Very informative. Information everyone who cares about their health and well being AND that of their family should know about.  And the book is an easy and interesting read. Highly recommend it!
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Great acting, dark comedic. Interesting symbolism. Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening were awesome. Storyline relatable today in a strange kind of way.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Works as described.<br />Easy to use alarm clock. Could have more choices for clocks and sounds. Would like to use my own music for the alarm.

0307279189|5.0|What a modern epic tale of running -- a great read buttressed with stats and facts.<br /><br />If you have ever enjoyed a run through nature on trails for the sake of running, this book is a must.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I heard about this book on Oprah and had to get it.  It is a easy read but gives you lots of spiritual work to think about and make an effort to do.  Go back to this book to re read parts and i inspire me to do the work
B007REV4T8|5.0|Skyfall is a great Bond movie.<br /><br />There is plenty of action and unique twist to keep most people interested for the entire movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought it to go with my powerfast charger that I bought for my kindle fire 1st generation. I like the length.  I actually was pleasantly shocked because my kindle fire 1st gen works as soon as I plug it in.  When I used the charger that came kindle, I had to plug it in multiple times or do a hard reset to make it light up and start charging.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Purchased this movie to complete the trilogy.  It has 3 versions of the film to suit whatever way you want to watch.  Great movie, great price.
B00E5Q1HJS|3.0|With all of the writing talent out there, it is truly inconceivable that the Wrath of Khan has been rolled out yet again.  Particularly disappointing is the role reversal of Kirk &#34;dying&#34; while kicking the dilithium crystals back into alignment (also a ridiculous premise on a Star Ship) and Spock yelling out &#34;Khan&#34; as his friend expires.  Come on now.  I have been a loyal Star Trek fan since the original series appeared in the 1960s but this is straining my affiliation.  By all means make more movies.  The cast is terrific and uncannily morphs more and more into looking and sounding like the original characters.  But please find a script that values their talents and does not insult our intelligence.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I had been playing candy crush until I started to think I may need Xanax at the end of each round. Found this game and its amazing. Imagine.....a puzzle game that is relaxing! The soundtrack is amazing as well.....I actually downloaded it from Amazon too!! The game and the soundtrack were both worth the download and the money!!!
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I listen to this and I can't help but feel that this is how good pop music was originally supposed to sound, before something called \\"doing everything you can to get generic commercial pop music played on the radio and make lots of money\\" happened to the music industry.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is one of the few artists today (yes, ARTIST - not just singer) who truly never disappoints. I have NOT been a fan since the start, as I became a fan during The Fame Monster era, but I have followed her career and artistry ever since and if anything is certain is that this woman never ceases to impress.<br /><br />\\"Applause\\" is the first single of her fourth studio album A.R.T.P.O.P. (her first three albums being The Fame, The Fame Monster, and Born This Way of course).<br /><br />There are a number of things set Lady Gaga apart from her contemporaries like as Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Kesha, and others. Some of those things include the fact she actually writes all her own music, that she constantly continues to re-invent herself and transform (an idea that is, in fact, explored in the music video for this song), and the fact she truly, genuinely cares for her fans. How can you one be sure she doesn't say that just to appeal to the public, you may ask? It's quite obvious, really. This particular song (just like some of her past songs such as The Queen, Bad Kids, Born This Way, Just Wanna Be With U, etc.) was written not with the general public in mind, but exclusively with her \\"little monsters\\" in mind.<br /><br />Those who have made a hobby out of looking for things about Gaga to criticize have taken it upon themselves to declare that this song is vanity at its finest and that Lady Gaga is conceited and shallow beyond belief for writing/singing about living for the applause. What they fail to see is that this song is literally a thank you to her fans as well as an ode to the art of performing (which we all know Gaga loves, probably moreso than most of today's performers).<br /><br />While the song's chorus strictly speaks about her living for her fans' applause, the really interesting lyrics are found in the verses and I just want to point some out to you.<br /><br />In the ending of the first verse, she says:<br /><br />If only fame had an IV baby could I bare being away from you<br />I found the vein, put it in here<br /><br />She's literally saying that the only way she can withstand being away from her beloved fans is by having the feeling of fame injected into her very being. In other words, she doesn't care about the money. She only cares about the applause. And while money is the financial reward for the commercial success of attendance to a performance, the applause is the real HUMAN reward for the art of theatre found in said performance.<br /><br />An excerpt from the second verse says:<br /><br />I overheard your theory, \\"Nostalgia is for geeks\\"<br />I guess sir, if you say so... But some of us just like to read<br />One second I'm a Koons fan, suddendly the Koons is me<br />Pop culture was in art, now art's in pop culture in me<br /><br />Just like in the first verse, this verse is somewhat of a little jab at the critics who criticize her with the \\"Geez, where have I seen that before?\\" remarks.<br /><br />The reference to Jeffrey Koons is amazing and yet really obvious. I don't understand how some people seem to not get it. One second she is just a fan of Jeff Koons, and suddenly, she IS a Jeff Koons artwork. (Let me explain: in the music video, she reenacts Koons' famous swan sculpture during these lyrics; in her VMA performance she has Mr. Koons' Gazing Ball onstage with her; and recently she revealed that Koons is actually making a statue of her that will be used as the album cover.<br /><br />Lastly, the final lyrics from that verse are genius, if not a little indulging. She's saying that pop culture has always been depicted in art but that now there's an element of artist value found in pop culture through her (because,I don't know if you've noticed, but Lady Gaga is really like the embodiment of pop culture). Honestly, that's probably my favorite line in the whole song.<br /><br />Overall, it really is an amazing song - both in terms of sound as well as lyrics. The song is very \\"different\\" and extremely catchy and dance-able and it's simply unlike anything on the radio right now. And I'm not even saying that because I'm a Gaga fan. I'm saying that because it's really just very obvious. Gaga could very easily do another song like Poker Face and Bad Romance and get another #1, but instead she chooses to experiment with new sounds (as she always has) and evolve musically and artistically. This isn't another Born This Way because she's already done that and this isn't another song about partying, dancing, and sex because there's already an abundance of that in pop and rap music because most artists just do the same song over and over again in different ways (ehem, Katy Perry). That's what makes Lady Gaga so original and brilliant. Heck, the Lady even got early acceptance into NYU as a music major during her high school days, so profound meaning behind intelligent lyrics in her pop songs is not something to be surprised about. Pop music can be good music. It just depends on the artist and Lady Gaga is a great artist. She is a musician, in every extent of the word.<br /><br />I can't wait for the rest of the album!

B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Can it really be 20+ years since I first removed the packing from my first NIN album? I've come back for every offering since, and while sometimes I've been blown away (Year Zero, for example), I haven't always loved it (With Teeth). I had a difficult time digesting some of NIN's output, which reminded me too much of 14-year-old me. I'm a very different person now, and I while it's no artist's responsibility to grow in the same directions as their fans, I was disappointed that it didn't always feel like \\"my\\" music.<br /><br />But wow, do I love this album. If you're looking for the grinding, dirty feeling of The Downward Spiral here, you'll find none of it here. What you will find is mature, subtle sounds from someone who has come a long way from Broken. Sonically, this album brings a lot from Reznor's recent-ish scores, with a cleaner, more bleepy-bloopy electronic sound on many tracks. Also here are quiet ambient introspections, and a surprising straight-up pop-rock piece with \\"Everything.\\" Don't worry, there's still plenty of the tortured lyrics you came for. But it's the tortured words of someone who has seen a lot more life, and has grown and been disappointed and loved far more than Mr. Self Destruct had.<br /><br />This will no doubt be a controversial album for people looking for more of (insert your preferred NIN-era here), but I absolutely love this album.<br /><br />So, so good.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga is one of the few artists today (yes, ARTIST - not just singer) who truly never disappoints. I have NOT been a fan since the start, as I became a fan during The Fame Monster era, but I have followed her career and artistry ever since and if anything is certain is that this woman never ceases to impress.<br /><br />\\"Applause\\" is the first single of her fourth studio album A.R.T.P.O.P. (her first three albums being The Fame, The Fame Monster, and Born This Way of course).<br /><br />There are a number of things set Lady Gaga apart from her contemporaries like as Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Kesha, and others. Some of those things include the fact she actually writes all her own music, that she constantly continues to re-invent herself and transform (an idea that is, in fact, explored in the music video for this song), and the fact she truly, genuinely cares for her fans. How can you one be sure she doesn't say that just to appeal to the public, you may ask? It's quite obvious, really. This particular song (just like some of her past songs such as The Queen, Bad Kids, Born This Way, Just Wanna Be With U, etc.) was written not with the general public in mind, but exclusively with her \\"little monsters\\" in mind.<br /><br />Those who have made a hobby out of looking for things about Gaga to criticize have taken it upon themselves to declare that this song is vanity at its finest and that Lady Gaga is conceited and shallow beyond belief for writing/singing about living for the applause.

B009PEKRY6|5.0|Barely out of her teens, and no, being young isn't a crime...but perhaps this much talent at this age should be.<br /><br />I was so overpowered by Ms. Mendler's voice alone--and now I'm learning her songwriting holds hidden complexities--I tweeted to her that I could not wait for her music to grow into that voice.<br /><br />Now Bridget is talking about a second album, and we all know she knows she cannot simply repeat the first, yet still her music--her art, must be true to itself. That she must dig deeper to find the next level to her performance.<br /><br />That's where the pain comes from, because real art is neither easy nor always popular, but it must be a view of the future as the artist sees it.<br /><br />Most of my favorite vocalists have been singing professionally longer than this incredible young woman has been alive, so I can see her future quite clearly.<br /><br />She needs only the same kind of hard work and honesty she has already proven...and perhaps the most difficult of all at her age, patience.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It is refreshing to find a book that puts in Jesus life in a historical perspective.  I have always been more impressed by what he said and his life than what organized religion says &#34;about&#34; him. This is important. It is important because people throughout the world are drawn to religious organizations and other social organizations to define themselves as a member of a group.  It seems to be a part of our nature to feel we are more secure by believing what the group believes without questioning.  If everyone else believes it, then it must be true and if we question, we may find ourselves unacceptable by other group members.  However, one group cannot be right without someone with different beliefs being wrong. More people have died fighting to prove their spiritual beliefs than for any other reason in history.  It is great to find a book that tries to establish the facts of Jesus's life rather than organized religion's approach starting with the unquestioned assumption of his divinity. If there were more books like this one, there might be fewer religious wars and terrorists.  I found this book well written and informative.  It is a great book for anyone with an open mind and brave enough think for themselves.

B00D7JGL36|5.0|I can honestly say I have never been a fan of Buck Owens- too twangy for me- but this interpretation of the songs of Buck Owens and Merle Haggard takes them to a new level through very high quality musicianship and singing. You can tell which songs came from Buck and which came from Merle- they each have their own indelible style stamp on their songs- but the flawless performances from Vince and Paul puts their own stamp on them and pulls them all seamlessly together. Recommended for all lovers of great tunes and great guitar music.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|HTC One is a phone for music lovers and has great sound already, I thought this app might give me a little more control over EQ, but it drops my total volume by 20% or so when I tried to use it. Checked to make sure it wasn't just because the Eq was flat, total volume stayed lower in any configuration. May work great for Kindle or other sound a challenged machines, but if you own HTC one, don't bother.<br />2 stars because there was obviously effort put in to the app, the eq does change in the correct bands, everything looks nice and is easy to use. I would keep it if it didn't downgrade my sound quality for my particular phone model.

We get to watch him develop right before our eyes every season.<br />Karl is a product if his environment. Will he end up like Shane or Rick?<br />The writers are working hard to keep us on the edge of our seats.
1439102813|5.0|This book was a huge departure for me as I usually read thrillers and mysteries.  I am so glad I read this book as it touched me deeply.  I loved the character of Alice and it was very emotional for me to see her change so drastically.  My own mother is 88 and although she has not been diagnosed with the disease she still suffers from dementia.  This helped me a lot to understand how the person with dementia feels.  I think it is a well written novel and have already purchased Left Neglected, Lisa Genova's second novel.  I highly recommend this book!

B007SGM084|2.0|I only read this because I was under the impression that Ian Somerhalder would play the lead in the movie.  I figured if I was going to see the movie, I'd read the book first.  The first book really had no plot, just sex.  It's annoying how often the author uses the same descriptive terms over and over again....there are other ways to say &#34;bemused.&#34;<br /><br />Sadly I bought the trilogy off the bat, so I wasted my time and money on all 3 books.  Pretending Somerhalder was in the running was a great marketing strategy.  I wonder how many other fools like myself bought these just so we could picture him in our minds while reading it.  At least that part was nice, but I could have done it with any other romance novel and still enjoyed a story with an actual plot.

B000SEIK2S|5.0|I read Scalzi's re-write of Little Fuzzy and was not impressed.  I like his voice and he did a great job of making you hate the once lovable character, but I was such a huge fan I did not like what he did with the story.<br /><br />However, I decided to give Old Man's War a try because of the positives mentioned above. This is a good read, the characters are well defined, the technology and environment of the story are plausible.  This is science fiction that is not miles above the heads of us moderately educated readers.  Don't read Fuzzy Nation if your a H. Beam Piper fan, but read this if you like a good story that is entertaining and tugs at your emotions a bit.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I loved this action film, better than the other Bourne movies.  It was very exciting, the actors were great at it, and the way it started out, in the North Country, was spectacular.  It gave it a sense of the Old West, down to earth type, and yet in our time also.  Renner is excellent and so is Weisz.  I have not tired of it yet, especially when you consider what is being offered otherwise.  The only thing I wish they would stop doing is cursing, using God's name in vain.  There isn't a need for that.  Movies didn't have that until the last 25 years, and the  movies did well.

I did not stop smiling once during this book! It had me busting out laughing through the majority of the book!<br /><br />I LOVED LOVED LOVED the POV of this read. Not only is it told from his POV, it's like he's talking to you...guessing and telling you what you are thinking as the story unfolds. And for me he was surely spot on!<br /><br />Drew is so used to being able to get any woman of his choosing at any given time. He adores having one-night stands..he wants no commitment. He truly is very content and happy with his life. He is arrogant, incredibly handsome, a sweet-talker, and of course the woman flock to him because of his amazing ability in bed!<br /><br />&#34;I can't help it if they see me, f*** me, and suddenly want to bear my children. That's not my problem. Like I said, I tell them how it is, give them a good time and then the cab fare home.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Here's a fact for you--once I'm done, I'm done. I'm not the kind of guy who rides the same rollercoaster twice. Once is enough, and then the thrill is gone and so is the interest.&#34;<br /><br />The reader meets Drew during his self-pity party! He thinks he has the &#34;flu&#34;. When really, truth be told he has a &#34;heart-ache&#34;.<br /><br />Kate, an intelligent, witty, stunning, and successful woman challenges everything Drew thinks he knows about women, relationships, and love. This one woman will make him work so hard to unravel his ownself...and his heart.<br /><br />&#34;She's like a Rubik's Cube. So frustrating at times that you want to toss it out the goddamn window. But you don't. You can't. You're compelled to keep playing with it until you figure it out.&#34;<br /><br />I love good banter in a book! I love being able to laugh out loud as I read! I love the bad-boy-turn-good-boy in light of a woman he can't get enough of.<br /><br />&#34;She's everything I never thought I wanted. She's not just perfect--she's perfect for me.<br /><br /> I'd do anything for her.<br /><br /> Anything.<br /><br /> I want her near me, with me. All the time.<br /><br /> Forever.&#34;<br /><br />This is not just a one way street. Kate holds back with Drew as well. I will not give spoilers, but lets just say she held back graciously! She put up one hell of a fight! She made him work for her!<br /><br />&#34;I know you just got out of a relationship and I've never been in one. And I know I'm supposed to tell you that if you're not ready, that it's okay. That I'll be patient and wait. But..if i I say those things..I'll be lying. Because...I'm just not a waiting kind of guy. I'm more of a take-the-bull-by-the-horns, keep-at-you-until-you-break-or-go-insane kind of guy.&#34;<br /><br />Laugh and fall in love with Drew Evans!

B00DP3IESY|4.0|Finally, a science fiction movie that is unique and entertaining.  It misleads you a few times so that it can throw some interesting twists your way.  The revelations are truly weird, and the ultimate enemy of mankind is strange enough to leave you with a bunch of theories.  That's all I'll say.<br /><br />The movie has a mix of tense action scenes, interesting futuristic living scenes, and discovery scenes that thoroughly entertain.  The acting, settings, visual effects--all are astounding.  You WILL immerse yourself in this futuristic world.<br /><br />The movie is an action-packed futuristic love story thriller set on a ruined planet with robots, aliens, and a couple other weird things.  How can you go wrong?  Worth a buy.

1401938906|2.0|Got the book with great hope that what she says is true. About 5 more hours into the first 'experiment' and ''nothing'..no sign of anything different, or confirmation that my thoughts really create anything or direct the FP to do anything to prove itself to me. I like the book, and it holds hope, but so did the Bible when I first started reading it 45 years ago and like this, the 'promises' failed to materialize. Would be nice to have Pam suggest what to do if 'nothing' is the result of the experiments..especially the first one..seems like that one needs to work to have any hope for the rest. Would be interested to know what she thinks of alternative ideas such as the one I found at [...]  So far, it looks like we are really 'on our own' in this life..no God, no FP, no caring anything..just us. BUt the book is written well, even if it is not 'reality'.

0739378341|3.0|Its a fun read but if youve read at least two Grisham books before you'll recognize the recycled plot devices and character traits that he uses in almost every book:<br /><br />1) This book take place in the south which is full of racist conservatives<br />2) The plot involves a large sum of money and a dead federal judge<br />3) The protagonist knows he is being followed<br />4) The protagonist doesnt like the federal government<br />5) The protagonist is a young male lawyer (although this one is black..so that SOMETHING different).<br />6) The protagonist likes girls with long legs<br />7) The government convicted an innocent person<br />8) The cops use shady tactics to get a \\"confession\\" for a suspected killer.<br />9) The protagonist visits and wishes to live in the Caribbean islands.<br />10) The female accomplice has little to no depth.<br /><br />That being said, I wanted to see how it ended because the guy can flat-out write.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast is a scam. Stay far away from it. Just another product that was created to screw over the consumer. And their helpline is worst than the product itself
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|A very cool Bejeweled inspired game with some nice twists to set it apart from Bejeweled. The resolution is a little low, but you won't mind once you get into it. Also, some in-game volume control for the sound effects, instead of just on or off, would be nice. Still, it's a very solid&amp; enjoyable game.

0307271080|2.0|Nigeria is a source of rich literary pickings but on this occasion Adiche has stylised her subject too far.The story is constantly interrupted with her socio political ramblings about race, which I personally found tiresome. This is supposed to be a novel,fiction, but it is so overloaded with excessive descriptions of black people not fitting in that I was forced to skip a lot. No idea how many pages of a normal book it is but on my Kindle it went on and on and on. Too long. Shame, because I greatly enjoyed her Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow Sun.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game. It is very addicting. My 4 year old loves to play it with me. It something we love to do together.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Free app of the day: I am quite impressed by this application because it opens on top of what you are doing, which allows it load almost instantly. Buttons are small but doesn't inhibit you from pressing them. I like using it on their classical preset.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|the creator said simply open your music app then use the widget to open the equalizer, what widget is he taking about, looked for almost 5 minutes for the widget and finally realized the creator obviously doesn't know the right terminology needed to describe how to properly use this app, there is no widget but instead you have to add a shortcut to the homescreen not a widget due to the lack of an actual widget

B00E978FGQ|1.0|What in the heck did I just watch?! What a convoluted mess of a movie! The plot makes no sense, the twists are completely ridiculous, and the talent is completely wasted. Who is the protagonist? Who is the antagonist? Why did Woody Harrelson agree to this mess? Please help. I'm so confused by this movie. I can't believe I paid for this garbage.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is a very interesting and beautiful movie. The visual are outstanding, the actors are epic, the story is very well done, and the action is kick ass! I really enjoyed the love story that is intertwined, because this makes it not only a mans movie, but also a great date night movie. The 3D was very well done worth gear depth throughout, though if you are looking for pops this movie has very few, but the depth really does immerse you in the movie. This movie has a very big Star Wars influence, which is why I am rather surprised that Star Wars fans didn't cling onto this movie and skyrocket it to stardom, but as you can see by the rating it has on here it has gotten a pretty large fan bar and deservingly so. I enjoyed every second off this movie and am very pleased I picked it up. This is truly a must see movie, do grab your popcorn, you're favorite soft drink, kickback and enjoy cause its a spectacular ride!

Decent articulation and above average paint apps.  Don't like the mold line or seam on the neck.  Very noticeable.  But hey its a Man of Steel Superman figure!!!!!
0345533666|1.0|I hated this book.  The father was in such total denial and after the incident with the dog you knew the kid was a killer.  I couldn't believe the father was in such total denial and I wanted to smack him up the side of the head to wake up to what his evil son really was.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This mouse does everything I want it to. The driver that you download from their website allows you to modify everything about how this mouse works. The mouse feels light, but the additional weights that come with it give it the extra handling. I am surprised just what you can't customize on it. Better yet, you can change the DPI settings on the fly with a mouse button press to 4 customizable DPI settings, so certain games are easier to adapt to. I would highly suggest this mouse as a desktop mouse for anyone, as you can customize the buttons to enhance your web browsing to photo editting. The price and quality can't be beat.
B0041KKYDI|5.0|I know the term is much overused, but this movie is truly inspirational.  The grit displayed by this young man is amazing, particularly that he did not allow this one experience to change his life view.  He continues to display a positiveness and enthusiasm for life that is refreshing.  I highly recommend it!
B000002HJR|5.0|I am a huge fan of Rock and Metal.  I have listened to hundreds of bands, and thousands of albums.  Down's 1995 album NOLA (short for New Orleans, Louisiana) is probably my favorite album of all time.  With so many amazing albums out there it is really hard to pick favorites, let alone an absolute favorite.  That being said, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this is my favorite.  The band is a heavyweight of the Stoner and Heavy Metal genre, with members from Pantera, Corrosion of Conformity, Crowbar and Eyehategod.  NOLA basically sounds like a great combination of all those bands, becoming it's own brew of Southern riffs.  The riffs, done to perfection by Corrosion of Conformity frontman Pepper Keenan, are easily the highlight of the album for me.  Every track is gold, but my favorites are the opener Temptation's Wings, Lifer, Pillars of Eternity and Rehab.  Bottom line, this is one album that you must hear before you die.  The passion of the album will fill your soul with emotion.  This is a definite desert island album.  Get it today!!!!!

B00CL0J99K|3.0|NOTE: There are minor spoilers in this review, but nothing that would deter from your overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this movie and had a fun time, I think \\"Iron Man 3\\" is the weakest of the Iron Man trilogy.  That's not to say it's a bad film, it just means that I liked the previous two Iron Man films better than this one.  I should state that while I've become a big fan of Marvel movies, I was never a big reader of comic books - so my feelings toward the film are more about it's merits/flaws as a movie experience (rather than how true it is to the comics).<br /><br />I think about how far we've come since the first \\"Iron Man\\" (and it's not in a particularly good direction).  That film was refreshing because it played everything totally realistically - everything was tech-based, there was nothing supernatural.  And now, in the third film of the series, we've moved on to Extremis (which is by far the most un-realistic concept in any of the three films).  Now I'm not against fantasy movies, but up until now I've considered \\"Iron Man\\" to be one of the more grounded superhero franchises - and I liked it that way.<br /><br />Also, it seems the new mandate from Marvel is to tie their movies together as much as possible, which is fine but it also puts a strain on the individual story being told.  This film seemed to draw less on the previous \\"Iron Man\\" movies and instead focus on the fallout from \\"The Avengers\\".  I understand why the events in at film, notably the battle in New York, would affect Stark emotionally.  But that whole storyline feels unnecessary in \\"Iron Man 3\\", and Tony's random panic attacks seem very out of place (and don't mesh tonally with the rest of the film).<br /><br />PROS:<br />- As always with the Iron Man films, the crowd-pleasers - the action sequences and the moments of humor - were very well-done.<br />- Brian Tyler's score was fantastic, particularly the main theme for \\"Iron Man 3\\".<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Although I love the song \\"Blue\\" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music.  It just seems odd to not have AC/DC in an Iron Man movie (it fit so well).<br />- To me, Tony's panic attacks felt out of place.<br />- As someone who likes a certain level of realism in movies, the concept of Extremis (and in particular fire-breathing) was another step in the wrong direction.<br />- I just wasn't a fan of the Mandarin's character arc.  It was a valid choice the filmmakers made, but it just didn't play well for me.I love the song \\"Blue\\" that opened this movie, I really missed AC/DC's music.

B00E3IZIM0|5.0|\\"Pacific Rim\\" was one of my favorite movies this summer. It delivers on everything that a summer movie should - most importantly, it's a lot of fun and has a big heart. Guillermo del Toro is one of Hollywood's best working directors (particularly in genre filmmaking) - his experience doing creature features and his talents for visual design was exactly what this film needed.<br /><br />Obviously, one of the most appealing factors of this movie is the spectacle. This movie handled scale very well. One of my favorite shots comes from the first sequence, when a destroyed Jaeger falls in the snow right next to a person on the ground - seeing this massive 250-ft. machine next to a human was amazing. And it all looks photo-real; the visual effects and compositing work on display is top-notch.<br /><br />In terms of the 3D: it was post-converted rather than shot in the stereo format, but the process was given several months to be completed. \\"Pacific Rim\\" is an example of 3D post-conversion that was given the time and money to succeed, and as a result the consensus seems to be that it looks very good.<br /><br />Also, a movie with monsters and machines is going to require unique sound design. The soundscape is every bit as massive as the visuals. The musical score by Ramin Djawadi is one of the year's best and adds a sense of fun and adventure to the film (I highly recommend the soundtrack album).<br /><br />********<br /><br />LIST OF SPECIAL FEATURES (available on both 3D Blu-Ray set and the regular Blu-Ray Combo Pack)<br /><br />1.

The differences in the book set it afar from the movie, but in a good way. I will read this again and again, just as I will watch the movie again and again.

0064471837|5.0|When I first came to Sabriel from the Seventh Tower series, I wasn't sure if I was ready for a novel that was considered to be \\"adult fiction\\".  I needn't have worried.<br /><br />Sabriel is a novel that not only paints a world of mysterious magic and whimsy, but of possible (and very real) terror, if you know where to look.  You follow a character that is shunted into a world she only peripheral knows from her loving, if oft absent, father.  She bumbles about, learning the ins, outs, dos, and don'ts of her new job and manages to be both relatable and inspiring.  Her story, and that of other important characters, creates a genuine coming-of-age tale while dealing with circumstances that are generally considered to be above everyone's heads.<br /><br />If you're someone looking to pick up a short fantasy series with characters you can empathize with, absolutely give these books a shot.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|not a bad game at all. I only wish it gave more bingo credits. I only get started and then out of credits
0062059963|3.0|There seems to be something about this trilogy that gives it the absolute love it/hate it quality. I mean, I was torn. After finishing The Selection last year I wasn't immensely impressed by how the book turned out, but man, it wasn't as bad as some people claimed, either!<br />It had a very unique premise, a nice setting, and - gotta admit it - Maxon, who made everything better, always! And OK, neither The Selection nor The Elite could actually convince with the characters or plot. America, just like Marlee and Aspen, May and pretty much all of the side characters seriously lacked depth or surprising elements. They continued to be the a little bit flat beings that they were. One exeption was Maxon. His story -as revealed toward the end - really caught me off guard and let me see him in a very different way.<br />The plot did pick up  in The Elite. It's still not the fastest paced dystopian novel I've ever read (by no means, actually), but there were some twists and turns that kept things interesting.<br />Sometimes it seemed a bit forced, I'll give the critics that. Cass certainly made it quite easy for herself sometimes, simply giving Maxon the power to change everything whenever he wanted to.<br />However, a good book does not always have to have unique characters or plot or a detailed background or whatever the usual reviewing aspects are. Sometimes, it's enough to just enjoy the story that unfolds in front of you.<br />I'm going to be honest, I didn't want to spend a lot of time on The Elite. It wasn't on my TBR list originally and I just got it on Netgalley, pretty unexpectedly, and decided to squeeze it in. Also, at the time I was ten books behind on my Goodreads challenge and really hadn't any time to waste.<br />And in that situation, The Elite was great. Exactly what I needed. Quick and light, but not contemporary. No endless highschool drama and blabla (which, if you know me, I love when the time is right), but a completely different world to sink into. Literally like a reality show, it confronted me with entertaining problems and fights that I didn't have to find a solution to. It had a nice little love story (and yes, a love triangle) that I didn't have to wrap my brain around, either (weird imagery, by the way...)<br />To cut it short, The Elite - like The Selection - did have its flaws, it's by no means for everyone. If you crave something on the lighter side, something unique. And if you like authors who do not spend three hours describing a tree that has nothing to do with the actual story (am I getting a littly cynical here?), but who simply tell their story, fluently and to the point, then you should try this trilogy.<br />Especially compared to other books, I really don't understand why these novels seem to get so much hate.
0385342055|1.0|I read Confessions of a Shopaholic years ago and really liked it. It was a cute, refreshing, quick novel about a quirky chick with a serious spending and hoarding problem.<br /><br />Over the years, I read each of the new Becky Bloomwood stories, giggling as she struggled to reform her ways in NYC, of all places and watching her plan a wedding with a nightmare mother-in-law and a spending habit she was trying desperately to hide from the somehow ever-patient Luke.<br /><br />Byt the time she found out she had a long-lost sister, I was slightly less charmed by her antics, but still on board. Then she had her baby and I found myself wanting to punch a fictional character in her moronic face. Because stupidity that is funny and quirky in a young twenty-something becomes bad parenting in an established adult. And everyone in Becky's life it a moron. Her parents. Her parents' neighbors. Her husband. They all indulge her terrible life choices and reckless disregard for her family's well-being with eyerolls and shrugged shoulders. Luke transforms from a super-humanly patient and devoted husband to a wimp who needs to lay the (figurative! Not literal!) smack down on this broad before she ruins their lives. It's not cute that they have to live with her parents because her spending is ruining their lives. It's not charming that their daughter is completely vile and over-indulged.<br /><br />And Becky, a character that fans have followed for...what, eight novels now?...never, ever grows. She is a simpleton with no self-control or regard for anyone else's welfare thrown into a variety of situations and failing to ever mature. She's so unlikable by the time she's raising her evil spawn in her parents' house that it took me six months to finish a Shopaholic book. Six. Months. I read the first few in, like, two days. I just could not stomach her stupidity in this last one.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that Kinsella has put Becky out to pasture. Her non-Shopaholic novels are so verygood, and the early Shopaholic books are cute enough. But after eight novels, to see a character still the same exact person she was in the beginning is disheartening and frustrating. Please take this broad's credit cards away for good, pop her kid in a decent reform school, and get Luke a pair of cojones.

This perilous journey involves travelling through the decaying Old Kingdom, facing dead who won't stay dead with the help of seven bells. Oh, and a sarcastic cat-creature known as Mogget.<br /><br />Nix's prose transports the reader into the Old Kingdom; a tense, coming-of-age novel that is unputdownable. This series stayed with me for a long time. I am incredibly glad it's not over yet!

B00516G5W0|4.0|I really love my Zorro's statue. But I did have some minor problems with placing im on his little support plate. Finally I managed to do that, but I still have problems with the little sword. hope I'll figure it out, how it works.<br />Anyway, arrived quit quickly, in an one piece with no major problems.<br />If it's worthy to buy or not ... Sincerely, I don't know. For a One Piece fan, like me, yeah, it's for someone else... Don't really think. But he is a cuty after all ^_^
B00B69UQJY|3.0|Yes, I'm a huge fan of DM; madly in love, yes I'm an old lady; fan since mid-80s. But I am forcing myself to like this album.  Some songs are good and enjoyable but, the word \\"soul\\" is seriously over-used in most of the songs.  When I think about Enjoy the Silence live i get the goosebumps.  No goosebumps with this album.  After all that, I believe Dave wants to get dirty with me when I listen to \\"Slow\\".

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Very fun game.  Have had no problems with pop up thingy.  Really works your problem solving skills, especially when you have had a TBI (traumatic brain injury) as I have.  The faster that I can solve the puzzel the more confident I feel that my brain is repairing itself.  Thanks for such a great game.  I like to sew also but have not tried that again yet.  :-)
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I have always liked th story of the hobbit and this movie doesn't disappoint.  It does a good job of keeping the little details in there and I can't wait for the Desolation of Smaug.

Old stories that you hear when you were a child are now brilliantly told in a more eloquent way by Chris Colfers perfect use of words, simply really good and not just another cheesy story

B000I55YU8|5.0|\\"Black Rain\\" is a period piece, set during the decline of the Soviet Union and years before 911. So this fish-out-of-water, 'Odd Couple' of cops movie portrays the prevailing American world view of that time: That Japan seemed technologically, if not militarily, poised to become the next great global superpower.<br /><br />The plot basically revolves around two cops: Michael Douglas's brash, New York City-bred Nick Conklin and Takakura Ken's priggish, Osaka-born Masamoto. The script is very film noirish--loaded with irony and distrust--as Conklin faces theft charges back home. Nevertheless, he is tapped to escort the ruthless Yakuza [Japanese mafia] enforcer Sato back to Japan. Once the gangster cleverly escapes extradition, Conklin and his stylish partner Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) struggle to capture him on his own turf.<br /><br />The xenophobia of both late 80's America and Japan saturates every scene, highlighted by Japanese characters' quotes as \\"Now, music and movies are all America is good for!\\" and American counterpunches as \\"If there was one of you guys who had an original idea, you'd be so tight that you couldn't pull it out of your [rear]!\\"<br /><br />The writers, however, almost overdo the clash of cultures concept. The obtrusive, ill-mannered Conklin is unsympathetic for the first half of the movie. And Masamoto is rigid, blinded by by-the-book duty to his superiors. It is only through a personal tragedy later on that Conklin and Masamoto bond and become more likeable and effective.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Black Rain's\\" greatest strength is director Ridley Scott's extraordinary efforts behind the scenes. His dark, rainy style (though not the source of the title) imbue the sets and photography and wonderfully set the mood. And, if you watch the accompanying behind-the-scenes extras, Scott works overtime to perform some nifty feats of international diplomacy and location trickery that save the movie!<br /><br />All-in-all, \\"Black Rain\\" is a very good action movie that pulls no punches (physical or verbal). Its top-notch production values complement a script which fairly accurately portrays the growing paranoia of its time through two headstrong leads (who must somehow bridge deep cultural differences in order to capture a dangerous criminal fugitive).on movie that pulls no punches (physical or verbal).

B004CMBZJC|4.0|Being fans of Doctor Who we have been wanting to watch Torchwood for some time. Most of the stories are pretty good but there is way too much sex between, well, everybody. Sometimes it seemed as though the show was more about the sex than fighting aliens and obtaining their technology.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I liked the movie but it almost seemed too technical for me to follow. I would still recommend it for viewing.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It's got a lot of interesting, loosely connected stories with plenty of character to be entertaining. Most of the jokes are not funny and are rather predictable but there are a few scenes that are absolute gems. Worth a look if you're in the mood for something cheesy, funny, and not too serious.

B007ZXK08C|4.0|I thought the story was excellent. It was fresh and new. However the script used to paint the atmosphere and background of the story was a bit like going the long way round. I felt that it needed tightening quite a lot. However having said that, the writer certainly has got hold of  the nasties that lurk in most of us and aired them blatantly, which takes recognition, firstly, and secondly, a lot of courage. I came away with feeling quite frightened about how the 'need' in our beings can play such an uncontrollable role. It certainly made an impression.
0553384775|2.0|So, this book was not near what I thought it was going to be. I was expecting it to me more about the SEC violations and the ramifications of all that. Instead it was a self-portrait of an addict. Honestly, this book should be marketed to recovering addicts, because that was the bulk of the book aside from about 75 pages of securities fraud. The whole thing just seemed very self-serving and \\"look at me and all the crazy stuff I did when I was rich as hell and doing every drug known to man\\". Yeah. I'm not sure how the movie is going to turn out. I might have liked it more if I had known what it was going in, but instead I spent most of the book waiting for the other FBI shoe to drop. Which it did in the last 5 pages.

0064471837|5.0|I suppose I had a less-than-typical introduction to 'Sabriel' since I had read 'Lirael' and 'Abhorsen' years prior. Rather than entering a completely new world, for me 'Sabriel' was a return to the same great characters, writing, and high fantasy that had drawn me into the two later books in the trilogy.<br /><br />What makes the entire trilogy so delightful are the well written characters and the carefully crafted universe. Sabriel and Lirael both stretch the mold on the stereotyped 'strong female character.' Rather than being oner-dimensional caricatures, they both have their own insecurities, questions about their identity, and short-comings which they try to hide from other characters; yet their sense of responsibility sets each on an inescapable path of total badassery. Also striking: this entire series deals with death -- and in a very exciting and novel way that retains much of the mystery surrounding the afterlife, but also making it something less frightening for younger readers. The entire role of the Abhorsen is to make sure the dead stay dead and continue their journey into the afterlife. It's the books' antagonists' fear of death that puts the world out of balance and precipitates the events leading to 'Sabriel.'
B00DW39B2K|4.0|I thought it was entertaining, John Travolta looked weird as was his performance, but De Nero gave an excellent performance as always, the scene where DeNero shouts in agony seems so for real.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Much darker than the prior series, but entertaining. Some of the situations are too real in the sense that I could see myself acting in strange ways if I were stuck in the situation. So, thought-provoking
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Orange is the New Black is an enjoyable book - Piper Berman recounts 15 months in federal minimum-security prison and how it opens her understanding to several things - how her behavior a decade earlier has created the incarceration, how her privilege minimized the duration, how the US criminal justice system is patently unfair, and that everyone, regardless of their past or background, has something to give.<br /><br />For those who found the text after watching the Netflix series don't be surprised that Ms. Berman's life is not as crazy as the character Piper Chapman created in the writing of Jenji Kohan.  Like Ms. Kohan, however, Ms. Berman's writing is filled with humor and clever lines.  The book is a quick read and flows well.<br /><br />I hesitated before purchasing book based on a few of the negative reviews that mentioned the author recounting her privileged background and education too much.  Would this be a \\"woe is me\\" text?  Not at all.  I think Smith College was mentioned twice directly and alluded to once as a seven sister school.  That's too much for a 250+ page book where a person's background is key?  No.  I did not share the other reviewers' experiences.<br /><br />The end of the book captures perfectly the ambiguity of the corrections system, how prisoners are (mis) handled, and the vacuum of real policy or leadership and creates a feeling of suspense.  It left this reader wanting learn more about the writer, how the experience has filtered her perception and her subsequent choices.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Glitches with update &amp; lost my game at level 30. Tried again and lost it at 50. Money disappears as well. You will never ever reach anyone at game support. Ever. Worst experience I've ever had with a game. Beware.
0812982622|5.0|The most improbable parts are the truest parts of this dark comedic novel of a North Korean everyman reinventing himself and eventually finding love and redemption in a nation cowering in the shadow of its portly &#34;Dear Leader.&#34; The propoganda that punctuates the text is lifted from real broadcasts and headlines. The major role Kim Jong-il in the cinema is also true. Only the well documented violence of the dictatorship is toned down in the novel, where there remains plenty of pain and oppression to go around.<br /><br />With all this, the novel is hopeful, doing for North Korea what Casablanca (a movie important in this novel) did for Nazi Germany by showing love and hope in the face of political and military might. And while the main character Pak Jun Do is the son of the master of an orphanage, it is Kim Jong-il himself who proves to be the true orphan master. The everyman protaganist could only arise in such a distorted world where his improbable story is made possible.<br /><br />This Pulitzer Prize winning fiction would make a great book club book. It's a quick read driven by a desire to see how the story will unfold through the twists and turns of the dark maze that is North Korean life.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|A very interesting book! It had many twists I wouldn't have thought. It was very well written. I highly recommend it!

Also I want to download to my device (Kindle Fire) so that I am able to read when I do not have a Wi-Fi connection but I have not been able to do that either.  I just recently purchased my Kindle Fire and am not very familiar w/ the device yet so maybe I just need to learn how to do these functions. Any recommendations would be appreciated.

1451626096|5.0|The book is so good, really fun to read. I didn't quite like Elizabeth of York from the end of the \\"Kingmaker's daughter\\" (playing the temptress to another woman's husband), but in this book she is really nice and interesting. I love her observations concerning her husband and her mother-in-law's hypocrisy. The mother in law fasts, prays while plotting murders, intrigues, false accusations on innocent peoples and how to control her daughter-in-law. Elizabeth Woodville should have poisoned Margaret, the old bat, once and for all. The woman was so self righteous, pretending to be a sincere Christian woman but she was really evil at heart. I liked Henry VII at the beginning of the story but near the end, really, I felt pity for Elizabeth, she deserved a better husband, not this momma's boy, this coward man who plotted to kill other innocent men, was obsessed and greedy and two faced, and was trying to have a mistress while his wife was trying to give him more heirs and to set him at peace, but the ungrateful husband just couldn't love her back. The end was so fast and unsatisfactory IMO.

Reinstall the USB 3.0 driver from the Motherboard Website(ASUS) and still that port is of no use now. I'm scared to connect this to any other USB 3.0 port now.

B00BEIYMZ6|5.0|When I saw the trailer of this movie, I knew it wouldn't dissapoint... it looked so funny, and just as the trailer promises, the movie is even funnier!<br />I was waiting for this since it was announced, because I'm a huge Jennifer Aniston fan, and I like Emma Roberts too.<br />The story moves on quickly without anything taking your mind off the main plot (which happens a lot in current comedies), and it's filled of clever jokes that will make you laugh out loud, and even sexual jokes (but finally tasteful sexual jokes that actually make you laugh, and not feel disgusted or annoyed like it happens with other movies), for me, that was the best, the way they handled sex with comedy without getting too disgusting or too naive.<br />Jason and Jennifer have a great chemistry, and Emma Roberts impresses the audience with a bad girl role after always playing a nice girl on her other movies. But Kenny (played by Will Poulter), was the best of the movie. Kenny is the typical stupid guy in a comedy, but finally, this movie shows that a character doesn't have to be annoyingly stupid to be funny, just the necessary when it's needed! I hope to see this guy soon in other movies because he really has the talent.<br />The film counts with unexpected twists that leave the audience shocked, but still making you laugh throughout the whole movie. The only thing that I didn't liked was the ending, I thought it was too predictable, but still enjoyable! Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I even dare to call it one of the best comedies of 2013 so far! It's totally worth the pre-order.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's ok for 99&cent; because it does have big maps but almost too big and its just not that scary but it's at a good price of 99&cent;

B005LRWRZ8|5.0|I've been listening to these guys since Peace Sells came out, and I can say without a doubt that with the exception of the title track, this is a solid, heavy album. I thought the sound on Endgame was a little distorted, but not on Thirteen. The sound of it reminds me of Countdown-sonic and heavy.<br /><br /> The songs are all catchy and heavy. Good double-bass parts, and excellent riffs-especially from Mustaine. They sound like a batch of songs from the old Friedman/Menza lineup. Tunes like, Deadly Nightshade, New World Order, and Black Swan you can hear over and over, and never get sick of them.<br /><br /> I'd tell any fan that, if you liked Countdown To Extinction, or Youthanasia, to definitely give Thirteen a spin. Mustaine's voice sounds excellent on every track-even on the one I didn't like.<br /><br /> Haven't heard anything off the new one yet, so I can't compare it to that, but if you love Megadeth, put Thirteen in your collection.<br /><br /> *(The songs on Endgame weren't bad, it was the guitars. They sounded screechy as hell, and distorted. Not bad enough to not buy the disc, I've heard way worse from bigger selling bands. Plus, there's a song called Headcrusher on Endgame that should wind up a Megadeth classic if there's any justice in the land of Metal).

B00GX50BD2|3.0|The film attempts to cram 40 years of history into 2 hours. It starts with Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher) dropping acid and hanging out with the counter culture group. It shows us that he was a very flawed man and early on is called an a-hole. In addition to glimpses of Steve's personal life, we see his difficulty in dealing with the various suits who want to make dollars and sense of the company.<br /><br />The main problem with the film is that Jobs is the only character that is developed and he is unlikeable. There is very little connection to the viewer. While I love a 60's music soundtrack, the songs they selected were hit and miss with clearly better selections available. The credits show us a picture of the real life individual next to the actor that played them as a way to say, &#34;Aren't we clever?&#34; The secondary actors were cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />The film sends a message of innovation and thinking outside of the box, which is weakened by the personality portrayed of Jobs. Worth a view as a rental.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|Many SCI-FI stories are there to teach a parable or some kind of lesson.  This story focuses more on the love story and some of the complexities introduced by future technology.  This one has several surprises, not just the spooky stuff in a dark ruin.  It's got enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat, while the love story smolders in the background.  I won't tell you any of the details, but I was very pleased they found a way to end it on a hopeful, positive note.  Nicely played !

B004YW4L5K|4.0|Gaiman has included the asides that were left out of the original work, much to the readers delight.  Juxtaposition and an uncanny sense of which way to wander bring it to the climax.  The inherent story can be almost anything the reader needs it to be, as the underlying morality tale unwinds.  All in all, very satisfying and enjoyable!

B007XXD3RE|5.0|very nice item as i am acollector this is good as it is in a box set this has some good odd songs of u2 not often always heard
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Enjoy the show very much and great to relive the nerdy humor. Sheldon is the best. Good quality used product.
B00C6B9PX4|5.0|Here is a man who can get something done. Obama should take a lesson and get something done himself, besides golfing
B008NW67E0|4.0|Thanks Mumford and Sons for this record.<br />It lp as a whole is nice to listen to. Good investment overall.
B008469DGY|5.0|This game is so addicting! While it is more of a hole-in-one type game instead of golf, it's still a blast to play. The graphics are amazing and beautiful. Be warned: once you start playing this app, you won't want to set it aside. I don't play golf, so not sure how accurately the visuals mirror the real courses, but I am impressed with this fun and challenging game.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|never really used it that I know of I can not be faire in assessing this site since I have not used it
B006O5XYWG|5.0|This is exactly what will happen in the end. Just keep putting those kind in leadership rolls and it will be exactly as wild as the movie. The genetics of it all is why.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Arnold is getting old. Funny movie at times. Actors could have been coached a little better on firearms use. It was a good movie.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|Great film in a great Blu-ray print. This film goes into some deeper issues of the relationship of man and machine while providing a hell of a thrill ride.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app daily to check weather condition  in the area I live or are traveling to, to monitor weather alerts and phenomenoms that may be occurring in our area
B004B63M1S|5.0|I loved this movie... I love anything about hard working Hispanics. Too bad Obama cannot get his kind to work.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I used this item lightly for 6 months and then it died.  Would not turn on.  I tried to contact the seller 3 times, but got no answer to my emails.  The product worked fine for the first six months and I liked it very much.  I have another one and am waiting to see if it dies soon.
B00439MV42|3.0|Great movie, but I had mediocre playback.  About halfway through the movie, after watching in full screen with great definition, the movie became much more blurry and had poor viewing definition.  Not sure if Amazon's server were slowing down or if my ISP was throttling traffic back.  Either way, it was very disappointing.
B008JFUO36|5.0|Oblivion is simply the best sci-fi movie ever, ignore the stupid critics who don't know shit about films. Tom Cruise is the greatest actor of all time.
B004LWZW6U|2.0|Reminded me of the total mess our present liberal government has created. Under the leadership, hahahaha, if you call it that, of obama
1423140605|5.0|I wouldn't even know where to start with this book.  With the ghosts possessing people and blowing things up?  The psycho hags?  The giants in ballerina costumes?<br /><br />As with anything Mr. Riordan has written, the book was absolutely filled with hilarious dialogue and truly random bits of humor, all entwined with adventures and a fast-paced plot.  I'm happy to note, as well, that Rick Riordan is NOT one of those authors that gets caught up in his own hype and loses steam.  He's only getting better with each book.<br /><br />This book was, however, a little darker than the others in the series, and not just for the way it ended (though I absolutely loved the ending--talk about a cliffhanger!).  I think it's just that while death and possible death have always been a part of this series, it seems closer in this book.  The encounters with the monsters seemed less like we'll-laugh-about-this-later sort of adventures and more like battles that leave psychological scars later, and though our heroes escape again and again, there's more of a sense of pressure and doom...all of it, of course, adding up to a very intense book I honestly just want to read again.  I'm so very, very glad the next book is almost out.
0064471837|5.0|There are a small number of books that I would consider the most important stories I have read. Ursula K LeGuin's Catwings got me into writing fantasy. Robin McKinley's The Blue Sword got me into epic fantasy.<br />Garth Nix's Sabriel introduced me to writing fantasy out of the box.<br /><br />I can't remember how many times I've read this book now. I own at least 2 copies of it, and they are well loved. Not only is Sabriel good as a stand alone novel, but it is a great lead-in to the full series! Sabriel is one of the best written female leads in any fantasy I've read, and this book has left a lasting impression on me. If you haven't already read this book, I'd definitely recommend this for your reading list!
B005ISZRES|4.0|I enjoyed rereading this book on my Kindle for my book club. This time I needed larger print. Kindles are great!
B00BOXZAG6|3.0|I would save my money and pass on this one. A few interesting 3D affects but have seen better examples.
B006P96PAO|4.0|Yes, a good clean movie with a moral lesson for everyone.  Helping fathers to be fathers and care for their families while still working and being a part of their community.  What more could you ask?
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like this redneck fun . Really cute easy for me. Good all around fun.<br /><br />I am usually not one for these types of games but I am hooked on it so get your red neck on!!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This epic book is written in a very nice and funny way and provides you with a deeper understanding and practical experience on the law of attraction and quantum phisics. As Abraham/Esther Hicks used to say:&#34;words don't teach&#34; and here Pam Grout gives us the opportunity to experience the principles behind quantum phisics.
B001GCUO52|5.0|A fine example of how Obama has duped the American free loaders into voting for him. He staved off elimination by lying and cheating but in the end, the liberals are done for.
B00846REIS|5.0|I am loving the crossfire series, it started a little slow, possibly because I was comparing it to 50 shades.  I am on book 2 reflected in you and it does seem so much like the author read 50 shades and then wrote her books.  However, it is pretty well written and an easy summer read.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|This game is so fun you get to play mini games, be a model, singer, an actor, wear fabulous clothes, date super stars and win rewards. And you don't get to a certain level and then have to get the full version. This game is completely free. You don't have to buy coins it your patient because you get a lot of coins when you get a job. You don't need to buy jems because you get ten every time you get to the next level. I wouldn't mind paying $5.00 for this game.
B00C6B9PX4|5.0|I have seen this movie a hundred times but never has it looked and sounded so good until I got this blue-ray.<br />This is a must-have item for movie lovers!
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|Reminds me of the Obama administration. Starts out with them all being finished and due to ignorance of the American free loaders, turns into another four years of disaster... Only to eventually end in the way fate destined it to end.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My Grandson has other Bruder Trucks, and loves them. This was a Birthday gift, and, he was so happy to receive it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This is usually not my type of reading material but I loved it and can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy! This story is witty, funny, sexy and is a definite page turner. Can't wait to see how they translate this to film...
0060920084|5.0|I have read thousands of books, and this is my favorite. It never fails to make laugh. Bryson is brilliant! Warning: You are likely to laugh in public when the recollections of Bryson's phrases hit you at the worst times!
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Ridiculous movie, a complete scam. Don't waste your money on it. Nice effects to disguise the lack of a good storyline.
B00447G29S|5.0|This is a gift for someone who religiously watches Polar Express every Christmas. We thought the 3D version would be a big hit. We are giving it to him on Sept 10th.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a great app but right now it's making my armor look funny if you have answers help. But this is seriously the best app
0060594896|5.0|What I liked about this book is that it is specific and does not engage in any wishy-washy general talk. It also drives home the point of success being a result of working hard AND smart. Bought copies for my children and godchildren. Should be required reading for high school and college students.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love it.  Sleek, simple and effective.  Great value for the price.  We tried a few other covers.  They were cute but bulky and have yet to find one that fits as perfectly or protects as well.
B00BWQTZBG|3.0|The movie is dated but it did bring back memories of when I first saw it.  In a way, it's similar to another movie (Fail Safe) which I saw in black and white.  Both were strong indictment on the risks for the nuclear annihaliton and provided me with a lot of excitement and entertainment  In so far the quality of the dvd and how t was shipped, the disc was good but it was loose within its case.  Shipping depts. should ensure that the disc is properly engaged in the case.
0817439390|5.0|Awesome. if you want to do more and more on the &#34;how to take a picture&#34;, all of his book are awesome. I ordered them first 3 now I order the &#34;Beyond Portraiture&#34;.<br /><br />Thank you Bryan!! your books are amazing.....
0897502027|5.0|It is amazing that we have this guide. Reviewing the book and then watching his moves will lead to revisiting both over and over again, each time learning more. This is a book every martial artist should have.
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|Very detailed information. I LOVE the graphics. Also the hourly weather updates and the forecasts for the days ahead are very helpful.
B00EPL4PBK|2.0|And not in a good way.  There are some good riffs, but some songs sound like the band directly ripped off Metallica's Black Album.  The Bonus Track St. James is the only standout.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|very hip, fun, sexy series. great character development, story lines are interesting and love the strong women. makes me want to go to Harvard Law!
0380713802|5.0|This book is as brilliant as The Lost Continent! Bryson is the ultimate travel writer and the ultimate person to take you away. Travel Channel needs to sponsor his visits to Africa and Asia so that we can have more of these witty gems from Bryson.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|so.....<br />Am I losing my hearing that I decide to use Chinese ?!?<br />Dare u stop watching movies when u start talking Thai ?!?
140006922X|5.0|This was an excellent read. I am always looking for a different twist on Christianity and this book did just that. I would recommend, that all conservative Christians read this book. It just might make them think outside the box a little. Awesome Read!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game always has you coming back for more. This is a good game and it is free for the time being. Doesn't hurt to download it and try it out!!!
0316017930|5.0|This is a fantastic book that everyone, especially young people, should read because it highlights the value and the need for hard work.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|While this had some innuendos not suitable for children under 18, it was a great movie.  A perfect role for James Franco, and I am now a Michelle Williams fan.  Great surprise ending.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this book and The White Queen. This story was fascinating to see where Henry the 8th came from and how hard his father had to fight to keep his throne. Since reading this book and The White Queen I have started to look up some of the information mentioned in the books and to trace the rest of the royal line and it is so amazing to see how much the throne of England was fought over. I am really hoping that there will be another book continuing with this family's story.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|It is a change in general sound with some flavor of avenged sevenfold still left intact. I enjoy the fact the band continues to do new things and I frankly enjoy this new drummer despite the critical opinions some may have of Arin.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Great MBO from Gigabyte, everything works just fine, solid construction excellent components, bulldozer works as fast as a lightining bolt for heavy CAD aplications and 3D rendering with V4900. No regrets
B00008J2PG|4.0|In the production of The Scarlet and the Black, a fact-based story is told with delicate precision, avoiding the understandable temptation of being drawn into a political quagmire where the greater issue of humanity could, and probably would be lost.  The cast of professional actors, led by Gregory Peck, Christopher Plummer, and John Gielgud provide a set of absolutely superb performances<br />as they weaved in and out of dangers and threats of danger.  Great movie!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I bought this book based on the Amazon description and the reviews others wrote. This is the first Liane Moriarty book but not my list. I can't wait to read the next one.
B0098460O4|5.0|I am thankful for being led to their online videos. Could not help but watch all I could find. Truly life changing for them, and also for all that listen. What talent!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|No where in the description did it say it was the UK version.  I was a little nervous after reading some complaints that it was not the US version.  However, I was very satisfied with the series!  I saw no problems with it at all!  A friend had introduced me to the series, so I had viewed the US version.  I saw no changes or edits in the story at all!  Very pleased with my order.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Check it everyday. When I worked for the airlines, I packed clothes according to The Weather Channel and watched all the time! And  because Jim Cantore is hot!
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Plot development and character development<br />camera directing and photography<br />availability of access and price and the fact there will be more
B0034G4P9E|5.0|A great story of a torn family brought to love and forgiveness. I've watched over 5 times, and brought it to the attention of others.<br />Highly recommend  to anyone needing thrills and their heart touched.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much especially when you're going against your friends! I love the mystery box and I love the hoverboard and when I bump into things I get like a second chance not to mess things up lol
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Excellent writing.  Page turner.  Surprise ending for sure.  I highly recommend this book even if you're not interested in books about lawyers and trials.  Just AWESOME.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|An overabundance of sex .  It did not hold my interest for I knew what to expect.  I am going to read book two for I wonder how long she can stay away.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|Appreciated the easy to follow format and the overview at the end. This book is a true eye opener of things we encounter day to day when trying to make a switch. It was also nice to have so many examples of the different strategies being out to action and being successful.
B006LSZECO|4.0|i'm not a huge fan of fiction, but took a shot at this after hearing an interview with ms. Flynn on NPR. At one point, the interviewer asked, &#34;So, do you reall think YOU could commit the prefect crime?', to which Ms. Flynn, unhestiatingly, replied, &#34;Yes, I do.&#34;<br />That was all I needed to hear! A quite enjoyable read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|He loves to play the game.  He has even found the lego minecraft kit that he now wants! Does it ever stop???
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this app 24 hrs a day !  This is my bedside clock and alarm and it works like a charm!
B00992CF6W|1.0|Zzzzzz, BORING!! Minecraft needs to update. Keep up with the real world Amazon. UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE UPDATE If you guys update, then I would be much happier and wouldn't have submitted this.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is possibly one of the best headsets to exist thusfar.<br />It has superior sound, superior features and superior overall quality.<br /><br />If you're going to purchase is buy it from here.. Retail price is rediculous.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|I personally think that this is the best one in the series and it is very good and I like it.
B008220AVW|4.0|I saw this on Netflix a few months ago, I had just gotten over a long night shift and wanted to watch something \\"lighthearted\\".  I liked Katy's music, but I wasn't a hardcore fan or anything.  The movie just flew by and I found myself liking Katy as a person more and more.  She comes off as such a genuine person and I was almost in tears when she had to go onstage right after she found out Russell wanted a divorce.  The movie does interviews with friends, family, and her business people.  It also shows a lot of behind the scenes footage.  Russell is featured somewhat in the movie, but Katy comes off as so caring and devoted (she took constant red-eye flights to go see him in the middle of tour) and Russell just comes off as a selfish jerk.
B00ADIT8U2|1.0|Wouldn't give it 1star. Too hard to get to map. No logic to the story line. I bought it thinking it was a Big Fish game. Very disappointed. Graphics are simplistic. All around bad.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I love this cd and I love all of the music on it if you like Adele get this CD.!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far my all time favorite book.  I started reading Colleen Hoovers slammed series and when I finished those I came upon hopeless.  It blew me out of the park with emotions.  My heart rate would go up and I cried on numerous occasions.  I love sky's character  I love holder even more.  I love  the story line and had me reading non stop.
0312330863|5.0|I bought this for my grandsons and they love it as much as I do.  The product was exactly as described and the shipping was prompt.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I have been a Rush fan for 30 years.  Their albums have formed the sound track of my life. This album however sounds a lot like Snakes and arrows. That recording<br />I do enjoy from time to time, but it seems these opus type concept albums are becoming a little long in the tooth.  I just remember the sense of exhileration when listening to songs like Tom Sawyer, Red Barchetta, The Spirit of the Radio, etc.  I'll admit it. I really like tunes that have a mass radio appeal about them. Like the classic songs from U-2, Big Country, The Kinks, The Cult, Simple Minds etc. Like the old saying goes: \\" sometimes less is more\\". I know that the era of Radio Hits is long over for groups like rush ( Sad ) But they are starting to go down that road where it all sounds the same. Where you can't exclaim \\" what a great song\\"!<br />What Im saying is Please go back to the formula of more structured, shorter songs. The type of formula that spawned all those great iconic, popular and bright songs<br />that you could easily hum in your own head.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|We love it a lot. We like the funny forms and pudding. GO PUDDING MONSTERS!!!!!!!!! Some levels are hard so later we look back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really awesome you can get this huge minion who just destroys anything in its path good luck
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|alive vibrant and consistent through all the discs this is the best recording of these concertos i have come across
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Great EP! Ella is awesome. Can't wait to throw some dimes down on &#34;Pure Heroine&#34; &#34;Royals&#34; spoke to me from day one.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|No one can say this wasn't a fun movie to watch. just clever and appealing all the way through.  no messy plot pieces despite a tricky premise.
B000VSAEYI|5.0|Fun pool, my granddaughter loves it. Set up only took a few minutes. Even the dog loves it. Good deal.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I have never taken the time out of my day to write a review about anything unless it was convenient or required but this book was so moving that I had too. I love John as as author as well as a person and he (through youtube) has given me much knowledge and wisdom. I cannot thank him enough for his contributions to society and me as an individual.
1781162646|3.0|I'm not a middle aged man, so maybe I'm not the target audience for this book. This is a murder-mystery with a slight supernatural twist ( pretty slight for S.King!) that is a good little story. However, the book is written as a sort of trip down memory lane. The narrator is now, thinking back to his time at Joyland in the 1970s, when he was a college kid. I guess I could do without the present tense part.<br /><br /> I liked the actual story, but there are a lot of interruptions from the narrator reminding us about how he is fat and lame now, or how he could not get laid forever and how sad that was, etc. I found that a little annoying. But, I did enjoy the overall story, and thought it was a fun departure for King.<br /><br />According to an interview I heard with him, Joyland is based on Canobie Lake Park, which is near me in NH, and it is fun to see the small similarities. Overall it was a fine book, but I'm not crazy about it.
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|disk no good, could not watch the movie completely.  I had to skip alot of parts.  Brand new, but must have been damaged somehow or poorly made
B000002MFE|5.0|I had the tape, but no longer a tape deck, so purchased the CD.  Love Eric Clapton - that is a great CD
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I haven't found any issues other than there should be other ways to be able to win the golden coins.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great game!love it! I haven't played for a couple of years but after i downloaded in my Kindle I can't stop play it!  Pure fun.! :))
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I started minecraft my first time  it was good but when it was September it was awesome game !!!!
0393327345|4.0|I hated Catcher in the Rye. I still do. Anyone giving it five stars probably hasn't read it since high school. I agree, the book had a serious cultural impact, but it has become dated. I nominate Fight Club to take its place on reading lists.<br /><br />Okay, I get it, we can't do that. One book features a student and the other features a working man. However, if we are looking for a modern critique on society, then Fight Club is the better choice.<br /><br />I wish I could change the title without changing the book's meaning. People that haven't watched the movie or read the book see the words \\"Fight Club\\" and dismiss this as a senseless story of violence. I suppose Catcher in the Rye received similar confused critiques.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this quote-worthy book. It's a great read; Chuck Palahniuk has a unique voice. However, I grew weary of witnessing the mental breakdown of the protagonist and the chop suey of words. Sentences repeated themselves and perspectives were mashed together. It all became sensory overload after a while--like staring at a Picasso painting for too long--brilliant, but wearing.<br /><br />That said: here is a book that makes you think. Is there life in the realization of death? Is nothing static? And what is our end game? Deep thoughts that make this book a deserved read.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|My family and I play it all the time. A wonderful game when your bored. Bad thing is that it is addictive. It is amazing for a free game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|there are so many intertwined stories that it stays interesting, even as they yank your heart strings in all directions!
B003A3K3JW|5.0|Exciting music - and who better to conduct than Gustavo Dudamel, who brings out the power of an orchestra.  I love dramatic music and Hispanic music.  This is a fine addition to my CD collection.
030758836X|5.0|I was standing in line at the library, trying to counterweight the heavy book bag in one arm and the precariously stacked books in the other. Then I saw it. Gone Girl: predominantly displayed on the fourteen-day loan shelf. After a year of everyone talking about it, over 13,000 reviews on Amazon, and a movie deal, I had to check it out. The landslide of books slid across the circulation desk, with Gone Girl skiing on top.<br /><br />The best description I can offer of this book is a retelling of the movie American Beauty, but darker--much darker. Herein is a story of a marriage gone wrong, told in dastardly alternating viewpoints. The author builds a downward spiral momentum through a perfect channeling of perspectives, both male and female.  We are graced with charm and wit, and we are shocked with deception and connivery.<br /><br />I imagine women readers may feel uncomfortable or let down before the end of the first act. Reasonable so--this is a deliberate maneuver by the author and showcases the intelligent design thereof. The book in its entirety is something everyone can rally behind.<br /><br />The narrative is smart and sexy. And I don't mean erotica. I mean word pornography. Big words, small words, words used in various ways. The author did a great job of making nearly every sentence mean something relevant.<br /><br />I can't go into much detail about the book without spoiling most of its fun. What I can say though, is if you enjoyed the movie American Beauty and if you enjoy a well-constructed plot, then check out this book.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|the case both met and surpassed our expectations. not happy with  the other portion of my order im usually very satisfied with my purchases on amazon.com but unfortanately im up in the air over ordering anything else in the future :(
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My eighteen-month-old grandson loves this. I don't know which he prefers, the fantastic sound effects or the rewards for correct completion. Well done!
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|Love this game! Graphics are great, the cars are detailed, gameplay is smooth with little to no lags.<br /><br />I'd like to see the leader board to show how many total players
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show on TV. They should NOT have killed off Merle though. Their was so much more to explore in the Merle/Daryl story.
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|I'm a very casual gamer, but this looked like a fun app to try.<br /><br />I can't get past the very first time trial! The physics of the game aren't true. It's hard to drive straight through the narrow gates, the car spins out or goes incredibly slow on the grass.  (My device might play into this as well.)<br /><br />I was looking for a game I could play in my spare time, but I do not want to be stuck on the first level of a game for a long time, trying to figure out how to adapt to the physics of this game.<br /><br />The developer would be wise to give stars or something, so that very casual gamers and kids can unlock levels, but experienced gamers can be challenged to beat their own scores.<br /><br />I'm uninstalling. :-(
B002VBV1S6|5.0|My fiancé convinced me to read this book and I was not at all disappointed! The way that Lynch weaves his tale through the world of his creation is purely magical. Definitely a must read for any fan of fiction
B005K17RU0|4.0|pretty good app. I was able to to get all of the info I need and then some. the video's are very helpful because they tell me in real time were the clouds are.
B002ZG98FU|4.0|Rachel McAdams nails the life of desperate TV Producer. She suffers the trials of juggling stories, personalities, and (most important!) raising show ratings. She hardly has time for hurried romance. Could be a grim tale, but Aline McKenna kept the script jumping between them. Diane Keaton and Jeff Goldblum get some telling lines; although I never warmed up to Harrison Ford's curmudgeon. This is more than a nuts-and-bolts view of creating a hit morning news show, its finding what challenges her.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Fantastic and unusual story. And the good part is, &#34;it is a true story&#34;. I can recommend it to people that like true history
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun to play but it does require a lot of patience if you don't want to spend a lot of real money to play
B000FC2L1E|4.0|I am now completely hooked to the Outlander series--so much so that I almost find it painful to be so emotionally attached to the relationship between Claire & Jamie. I think Gabaldon is obviously quite a talented writer. However, I often find myself annoyed by her story-telling tactics. In short: while I love this series, I sometimes find myself skipping pages, thinking \\"Okay--get on with it!\\"  My criticisms arise most likely from reading screenplays and film analysis where no words are wasted. So if I was a more patient reader, I probably would be more satisfied with my obsession with these books. But alas, I am painfully hooked.
B003WE9TU8|5.0|Max Brooks tells the story of humanity's survival: physical, psychological, philosophical and spiritual. His short-story-memoirs style keeps the reader engaged and interested, and succeeds in providing a multiperspectival view of a fictional global war. Perhaps this is the best style to tell these sorts of stories in, including those about real-world events. Reading World War Z made me yearn for similar collections concerning real wars in global history. If anyone knows of such collections, a reply to this review with links would be appreciated.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I've sought out David Mack since reading the Destiny trilogy.  This book doesn't disappoint.  Fun, quick, and entertaining -- I had trouble putting it down at times.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was really in need for this, I am going into nursing and everything helps. so thank you, it came in a timely fashion and in really great condition
B00B8BR6CU|5.0|Lovely movie -  if you are a fan of Shakespeare and romance, this is a movie not to miss.  Love it!
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|I liked the chronological back and forth, it struck me as almost Odyssey-esque. Wonderfully inventive premise.  The angst was tempered with humor, while still keeping the book serious.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is really good, great graphics and actually gives you things to do. Gems are needed for some things but they're way easier to get than in other games.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is a fun game to play if you like subway surfers. It is kinda just kinda just like it.
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Very sexy and fun to watch. The ending was a little bit of a let down, but still an awesome movie over all.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This author is angry, and it shows in her writing of Gone Girl!  My husband and I stopped reading it early on.<br /><br />A very boring, and sad story.<br /><br />Marion & Dick Roever

0399159347|5.0|First time reading this author, no expectations. Was pleasantly surprised the story was well written and fast paced. The ending ties all the plotlines together nicely.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it. I hope that there is always an app available of Kindle Fire HD. If there is always an app I will always use it.
B007G5O3K0|5.0|I've had a long hard think about this one since I published my review on Amazon UK last year. And I feel exactly the same now as I did then, but now I know why. Why I had problems with the backing, that is. What we have here is an attempt to emulate the a-ha sound and it succeeds. However, when I buy an a-ha album all three members are equally important to me and I want to hear them all, er, equally; when I buy a Morten Harket album I want to hear, yes, Morten Harket. For me, the backing must complement not drown his vocals nor should he be upstaged.<br /><br />Anyway, I believe first impressions count so here are mine...<br /><br />01 - SCARED OF HEIGHTS: He lifts ME up into the sky with this track - absolutely exhilarating. Definitely one of the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />02 - KEEP THE SUN AWAY: The best parts are the great thumping fast throbbing beat at the start and his vocals switching from smooth and melodic to powerful and exciting. A grower methinks.<br /><br />03 - LIGHTNING: At first it sounded as though he was in the room with me but unfortunately the backing becomes too busy - his voice gets backstaged quite early on. He does rise now and then but just as his beautiful notes reach me they are overpowered again. There are lots of nice and unusual sounds, though, and I like the 'organ' two thirds in.<br /><br />04 - I'M THE ONE: I love the echoey sound in this at the start and I feel the Morten of the past. Again, the backing is too loud and intrusive a lot of the time so I'm missing those unmissable notes! The 'chorus' is a bit run-of-the-mill and without his distinctive voice the song might not be memorable.<br /><br />05 - QUIET: Oh joy, this is the Morten we all know and love - his vocals make me shiver - so so so pure and beautiful AND it has a simple backing. At times he gets closer to the mike particularly near the end and again it feels as though he is in the room with me. I think I might burst for it is so moving. This should be released as a single.<br /><br />06 - BURN MONEY BURN: Very a-ha sounding and I'd really like it if I didn't have to strain to hear the vocals through the noisy backing, AGAIN! Should I just assume this is meant to be an instrumental and the voice is incidental? Of course not. This is after all Morten Harket not a backing singer. How disappointing.<br /><br />07 - WHEN I REACHED THE MOON: Oow, dark 'rock' band sound then Morten starts immediately with falsetto - made me really sit up and listen. Add this great contrast, with increasing power as it progresses, to some weird and wonderful sounds from both Morten and the backing and here is one of the best tracks on the album.<br /><br />08 - LISTENING: This has a superb orchestral intro which is then interspersed throughout. It has noticeably short rhyming lyrics. The vocals are pleasant and elating alternating with urgent and then near the end it builds into exciting. But then it ends. A song that leaves me wanting more.<br /><br />09 - JUST BELIEVE IT: This is so nerve tweaking - the way the instruments twist around Morten's varying levels and lengths of notes is mind-blowing. I absolutely love its quirkiness! (Maybe too much drowning out of his voice in the last quarter though.) Another hit single I would have thought.<br /><br />10 - OUT OF MY HANDS: This has a piano nicely complementing the rich notes of Morten's voice. Lovely. And then in come the drums which add a third dimension. A truly well composed and performed piece.<br /><br />...What a shame that for many of the tracks, the song is marred by over-the-top backing where the components merge into a disappointing noise whilst drowning out THE voice we want to hear. To be honest, Morten does not need ANY backing but if it is there it should be complementing his vocals not competing with them. However, because the songs are sung to perfection I cannot give Morten Harket less than five stars.<br /><br />I'm surprised to see that an MP3 version isn't available here inthe US. I bought both in the UK - the pre-ordered CD took too long to arrive, hence the download - and had the bonus of an extra track, 'UNDECIDED', on the MP3 version. For some of those who only bought the CD this was a bone of contention. For anyone who wishes to know, nice tinkly piano notes start this then half a minute in Morten joins in singing so sweetly. Many more interesting sounds are added but it becomes too busy and loud by the end.<br /><br />As I wondered if the MP3 processing had anything to do with my feelings about this I compared it to the CD on various equipment and I couldn't consciously discern a difference between the MP3 and the CD sounds. After playing the album many times I did feel less annoyed about the loud backing and indeed became mostly impressed by it. But, I do still feel there are parts that should have been toned down (particularly the drums) in order to let us taste the finer qualities of Morten's voice. However, it is a truly outstanding album and if you weren't in love with his voice before, you will be after hearing this.the US.

B005LLSZNM|5.0|It's dark at times but suspenseful and has great characters and story. very well done, great cast, great script as well.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|It gives options to play different ways which is good. Does not get boring! Good way to pass the time and keep it interesting at the same time
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It won't let me use it unless I have a YouTube account. I would like it if I could use it without a account
B004GXZ69W|4.0|Seems to significantly save wear on my wrist, although it hasn't completely resolved the pain issues I had.  It takes a little getting used to.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Love it! It is simple, sweet and intriguing.  Love the characters. I hate having to stop watching it. I could watch for hours!
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|More fun than the first game plus new characters that are interesting to use and keeps the game from getting stale play it have fun
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Very fun not too hard but still challenging if you like match 3!!<br />Great boosters. Hard to coordinate with the colors sometimes
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game is awesome. you get to fight globe with awesome gadgets and hack computers. this app is worth the money
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|The movie is hard to follow.  There are a lot of moving parts and hidden inuendos that are easy to miss the first time you watch the movie.  I watched it twice and the second time around, It made more sense and I could see more of the connections between the stories and the characters.  I think if I watched it again, I would be able to follow the story even better. The futuristic story of  Sonmi~451 and Hae-Joo Chang is my favorite.  It's such a powerful love story of two people from different worlds who come together to fuel a revolution. They find love and, in the end, sacrifice themselves for the cause. I also found the character of &#34;Old Georgie&#34; from the last story very haunting and entertaining.<br />If you watch the movie, watch it atleast twice or you just won't get it.
B00004CY38|2.0|This movie would not play in any of my DVD players. Format was not recognized. They made it easy and painless to return but I'm very sad I can not find a copy of Pretty Woman that is not the Anniversary addition.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am definitely enjoying this Mahjong game! The tiles are sharply defined, clear and very pretty too. The game so far moves along at a fast but gentle speed. I will definitely recommend it to my friends who are beginning to play Mahjong.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|As promised the scenes were excellent, showed well on my 46 in flat screen but the story was short. Hope there is a sequel.
B003QSHIPS|5.0|The LP was in great condition. The artwork inside the case was amazing cartoonist look to it. As for the music itself you have to have a certain appeal for hip hop, rap and electra. The songs are great in my opinion I'd say this is worth your money
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I read the Kite Runner and Land of 1000 Suns and was not disappointed in this book.  It was both sad and uplifting.  I am looking forward to his next book.
1781162646|5.0|Issued new as a paperback, and is a good S. King read.  It is more his new style vs his good old scary stuff, but it works for King fans, as does almost all his books.  Lighter and quicker than most, but an okay book.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I love this game. It is very entertaining.  Hard enough to keep it interesting but not so hard that you give up.  And if you get stuck, you can use a hint.  I have Hidden Letters too and they are both great games.  I wish there were more like it.
B000FA5SMK|4.0|DeMille is always pretty good.  Suggest you read Up Country.  This is up to his standards but a bit too predictable and tedious toward the end.
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Another great suspense/action/thriller by Lisa Gardner. It keeps the reader guessing and at the edge of their seat. It definitely kept me up late at night as I could not put it down.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Love this series and it is great the have the full collection. Comes in a nice box and the dvds have all been fine quality.  If you liked the show it is worth owning this collection
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Addictive and fun.  Easy for any age to play.  I got mine for free gotta love Amazon daily free app
B005XQLBU4|5.0|if you've played other missile defense games and liked them, you're going to love this one.I haven't really played missile defense games before, but i really like this one. this is a fun game
B004GTQ4DI|5.0|This show is so great, I so wish they had more seasons. Anyway, the characters are well written and you are really taken by everyone of them. I find myself having emotions for all of them. I love shows that do this, I means isn't that why we watch to be taken away to another place even just for a little while.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It was a good read.  It lacked the serious conflicts found in the television show But it was more emotionally Charged.
B007MDB71O|5.0|The characters are wonderful and complex.  I actually watched this movie because there was nothing else on, after a couple of minutes I was hooked.  I hope there is a John Carter 2 and I actually see it advertised.  I would go to the theater to see it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing.  It touched my heart and made me cry and made me speechless.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is lookinh for a great read and seeks adventure.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I think horrible the stupid kik bot is dumb  do not get once u have it messes ur kindle fire HD
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another winner!  I love this series more than \\"Fifty Shades\\".  It's a believable story with intrigue and mystery as well s a story of friendship and a deep love.
B00BV5FVR0|5.0|I am bereft that the story has finished. Fantastic finish to the trilogy. Smart, funny, real, sad and hopeful. Atwood at her best.
0345528581|5.0|This book has literally transformed my body in 3 weeks. If I need motivation I need only look in the mirror. I downloaded the App from iTunes ($2.99 also available for Android) and he does the work with you in addition to keeping time and track of your routines and progress. I've tried many things over the years and this is the only thing that has worked.  I look forward to the weeks ahead.  Long live Mark Lauren!!
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This app is awsome because when you listen to music you can listen to it louder and the boom is awsome if you could get this i really suggest it
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey, and unlike a lot of dramas, they don't run out of story ideas as they get further into the series.
B0060D11OU|5.0|Everybody loves MP! We bought it for our 2 yr old granddaughter. She loves it, Grandpa loves it. Everybody's happy.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Who can't get wrapped up in Sookie' s life. I'm an sad there is only one more book to come:(
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Another great Clancy novel about the Ryan's,with all of the original players still doing what they do best.<br />5 Stars
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works like a charm and does exactly what it says it will do. Wakes me up every time, no matter how early
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|This game is advertised as an adventure game. It is nothing more than hidden pictures. Boring!<br />It is free to download but then you are forced to buy anything you need to complete the game.<br /><br />Also your energy runs down quickly so you cannot just play - you must wait for it to recharge or you must purchase energy.<br /><br />I think it's a waste of time.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Enjoyed watching the movie and never saw the end coming.  Other than a few foul language words, the movie is suitable for all members of the family.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|It was nice to see the little guy become the hero. The beginning was a little slow to start, but won me over in the middle and kept me interested till the end. Nice ending too!
B00181JGI2|5.0|This is one of my favoite movies of all time. A cult classic. Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi are a hilarious ensemble.
B009AY04A8|4.0|I really enjoy puzzles and problem solving. So this is right up my alley. I have to agree about the dialogue. It was a bit much until I figured out how to skip the dialogue. One of two ways; tap through it or hit menu and tap 'skip dialogue'.  Overall, I really enjoy this. In search of more since I got through this one rather quickly.
B007TK77QE|4.0|Easy read, and I enjoyed the multitude of characters and each of their stories. Good bit of escapism, and not too heavy.
B005HED08I|5.0|What I'm loving the most is that I can watch them one right after the other, as they were aired originally.
1442359919|5.0|I have never read a Stephen King novel, though I have seen some films based on his books.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but this book received excellent reviews and I was drawn to the cover. I was immediately taken in for the ride through Joyland. Set in the 70's, an old amusement park, a murder, Carny folk... what's not to like. The novel flows nicely and the characters are well thought out and interesting. This is the kind of book you still think about after you finish it. I learned some new amusement park lingo.
B00007EDY5|5.0|it works with my Sunpak 622 pro. Yes it does. ten more words required. Six more words required. 2 more.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down! It really grabbed my attention from the beginning. Now I can't wait too read the other books by this author.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Realistic and true to life - a difficult concept to expierence, but very nicely produced and directed.  Acting is superb.
B008476HBM|4.0|I am just starting it, and it is so far easy reading!  I still don't like the ebook layout of no page numbers and just one page of floating words.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|If you are interested in better understanding of your mate and yourself (and who isn't?), then this is the book for you!  What a difference this has made since reading it!
B00CFA225Y|5.0|This movie is great on every level.<br />Highly recommended!!<br />Magical, exciting, and breath taking. You will feel like you are in a fairy tale.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I enjoyed the book, love the characters...who cares if the author added more books to the series? She felt there was more story to tell. I eagerly await the next installment.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm click is very handy! It's almost like I designed it just for me! The temperature that is displayed and the ability to choose which song you wake up to in the morning is AWESOME~<br /><br />This is what I'll be using from now on &lt;3
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this. It was crazy funny.  I was so able to relate to these people. It was neat to see how the relationships developed after having loss in their lives. One of those movies that makes you realize that you can love again and that you're not as crazy as you think you are! lol.  Someone just might be weirder than you.  Funny love story and definitely worth watching with someone else or even alone.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is way better than I thought. Thought it was going to be bad but it's really fun.<br />Poop poop
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This hidden object game is better than any others that I've ever played. While the scenes stay the same, the hidden objects move so you can't memorize their respective locations. It makes for a more challenging game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|my grandson loves this game  and i need to reload on new tablet. so he can keep playing. he's three
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|An B+ effort from Trent Reznor.  I really enjoy listening to this album.  There are a few good songs on this, and a couple of not so good ones.  I felt Mr. Reznor was all over the emotional map with his songs this time around.  The different songs could be put on different albums.  For example: &#34;Satellite&#34; could be placed on &#34;Year Zero&#34; it would fit perfectly on there.  The highlight of the album is &#34;All TIme Low&#34;  with its bawdy beat.  &#34;Find My Way&#34; is the off key song here, it just seems to be the only song that does not fit.  I just skip it.  I have never had a NIN song I've skipped.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Ordered it mainly because of the song that mentions Fireball whiskey (which I enjoy), but have found I enjoy the whole album. Songs are upbeat and the band seems to like to have fun which shows in their music.
B00ENBTI8C|5.0|Bloody and action packed as usual! Everything I expect from Spartacus. I was worried about the new cast, but they did well. The dialog, however, is getting a little over the top; but that has never really been the series strong point
B0063M22QO|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is so relaxing and such a wonderful stress reliever.  You can choose whatever option you want as far as intensity level.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game has everything you love about the games that are out there today. And<br />it's all wrapped into one.  It was hard to quit playing. Definitely get this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I enjoy being able to tell at a glance what the weather is.  It is easy to get to.  thanks
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I now have a full-length book to recommend people who start sentences with &#34;I can't&#34; or questions with &#34;how.&#34; I've been recommending julien smith's &#34;the flinch,&#34; because it's one of the few actionable treatises I'd read. Add &#34;choose yourself,&#34; with its stories of personal failure and actionable daily practices that should be lifelong additions for everyone, to the very short list of books that will be life-changing for many in all walks of life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|wow this game is the life of fun and you can fight mobs and mine wow this is a cool game
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|It is what you would expect from a free hidden object game. Nice graphics. I enjoy that there are quests and collections to work towards. You repeat scenes, but the objects are not always in the same place in the scene which adds to the challenge. I would recommend to a friend. The reason I did not give five stars is because you run out of energy pretty quickly and if you don't want to spend real money, you end up waiting a while before you can play again.
6305428050|5.0|Loved this movie. So cute. I remembered it from way back in the day. It's still fun to watch now.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I just had to get this complete season 1 of Glee.  I remember when this show first started and how much anticipation I went through waiting for the first episode.  I have a special place in my heart for performance art high schools as my daughter graduated from one.  I so enjoyed the musicals and concerts they put on that I felt a special connection with all the gleeks.  Once we lost Cory, I just had to go back and re-live all those special first season shows.  I can't believe how young they all looked only 4 short seasons ago.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Fun to play. Challenging games and nice graphics. I would recommend this game for any Mahjong lover. Happy happy happy :-)
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Loved this action packed movie that bought all the Marvel characters together. It was fast paced and kept me enthralled throughout the movie. Looking forward to the sequel.
B000P12LWY|2.0|In my opinion. This season didn't make me want to watch any of the other seasons. Not very accurate on the times. The acting wasn't all that great.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I got this after I saw them in concert! And, I absolutely love Zachary Brown Band no doubt about it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|To say this book was touching doesn't do it justice. It is such an honest account of how difficult but rewarding it can be to do the right thing.  So good on so many levels!
1612930425|2.0|It may not be a 'truth' universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife. However, It is a universally acknowledged phrase, from the book that has captured the hearts of many (not me though), Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.<br />First published in 1813, it is a charming, old style witty book but, from the perspective of a twelve year old girl living in the twenty-first century, I found it to be lacking in modern context.<br />Here is the plot - When rich and handsome Mr Bingley moves into the Netherfield manor, the small town of Longbourne is abuzz. The Bennet family consists of five unmarried daughters and their mother and father. Mrs Bennet is desperate to marry off her daughters to rich men and Mr Bingley is her dream come true. Mr Bingley introduces an entourage of interesting characters to the Bennet family and every character has an interesting personality and story that helps to shape the plot of Pride and Prejudice. If you were to compare the book to a TV genre, Pride and Prejudice would be a BBC classic British drama.<br />I was not particularly captured or gripped by the book and could not relate to it. Every single character had some sort of facade and complex back-story but, instead of finding this interesting, I found that it made the plot drag on and made the characters unrealistic and boring. No one could see anyone for who they really were and as a reader I believe that there still needs to be some anchoring characters that are simple and still unique.<br />The book would have possibly been interesting and relatable had I been living in the nineteenth century. It is a quaint and charming book but it has insignificant issues. Every problem is a first world problem and the book is not exciting or stimulating.<br />If you enjoy boring classic BBC drama, perhaps you will enjoy this book but I did not. I will leave you with a quote from Stephanie Hood's Amazon review: 'It is like a Victorian 'Keeping up the Kardashians'.'
B002OMZTSU|5.0|This book was very entertaining. It has made me choose adventure vs safety. Great inspiration Craig..thank you. I recommend the read.
B00BN3ECTS|5.0|Love this movie, granted its not exactly the same as the book, but what movie is! It's a movie I can watch more than once!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The book was alright can't wait to it get to the details of his past and hers. In this book I could have done without three to four pages is sex. I just hope it don't take another for the follow-up book
0064471837|5.0|I was first introduced to Sabriel, the first book of the Abhorsen series, in the early 2000s. During that time, Sabriel was not as known and I would have never known about the book had it not been for my oldest sister suggesting I read it. She had enjoyed it so much and had seen that I wasn't as pleased with golden compass series, so she felt the need to introduce to me a book she had just finished reading .  I've always had a vivid imagination and was sucked in the moment my sister said 'necromancer'. I honestly felt I finished the book in 1 or 2 days. The story involves a young, yet very mature Sabriel who ventures from her school and into the dangerous lands of the Old Kingdom. With nothing but her father's bells that are used to fight the dead and minimal instructions from her missing father, the Abhorsen, she fears there is trouble brewing in the Old Kingdom. The Abhorsen serves to bring the dead back into the realms of the dead and prevents necromancers who try and bring the dead back into the living world. With the Abhorsen missing, the Old Kingdom is thriving with the undead. Sabriel's journey crosses path with a man with a mysterious history, a talking cat-like animal (or is it?), and lots of dead chasing her. Readers will follow a young Sabirel bloom into womanhood.<br />I highly recommend this book to teens, young adults and older adults as well. I've introduced this book to a dozen of other folks as well and have started my own mini- Abhorsen Triology fan club within my group of friends. If you liked reading Lord of the Rings and any of Garth Nix's other books/series, you will surely enjoy this book as well. I admit, I've re-read this book so many times that I have lost count! It really is a must read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is so much fun!  I can not stop playing!  I recommend everyone to play this.  It is just awesome.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|A friend recommended the movie to me. I picked it up to watch when things on my satellite TV service don't offer much. It's a fun movie but very complicated in the information that's woven into it - touches on so many aspects of aging and life in general. I've watched it twice and plan to watch it a few more times as I gain something new from it each time I watch it.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I really liked this movie. But it keeps changing on you. I really don't understand the end at all. If anybody has the end and understands it let me know. But a really great movie to watch.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|So fun to play . I'm so happy i bought it . You won't regret but this . You will play for hours .
B004TIKXCE|5.0|This book ended up on my reading list because I saw it on a Reddit thread about must-read books that changed peoples' lives that it was a free download on Amazon.  Marcus Aurelius was the Emperor that got stabbed by his son in the movie Gladiator.  This is his journal, full of pep-talks that he wrote for himself and nobody else.  He was an eloquent writer, raised as a philosopher and initiated into the Elysian Mysteries, and so somebody really ought to take this book and make it the scripture of a cult. It is full of quotables that I want to cross-stitch and hang on my wall.  This is easily my favourite book of all time. I feel like knocking on doors and sharing this good book with everyone.  While reading it, my friends and family heard me quote him all the time saying, \\"well, as my boyfriend Marcus Aurelius Antonius says...\\"  I couldn't wait to finish the book so that I could start reading it again. If the rating system gave me the one-time ability to rate more than five stars, I would use it on this book. I don't even want to be writing to you people right now. I want to be with my boyfriend, Marcus Aurelius Antonius. Peace out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great App. Challenging. Recommend great way to get the mind thinking.  Be part is its free. Great for kids to.

B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I have been doing some wine bottle crafts and thought this would be a nice addition to my armory.So far it's not as easy to do as it is described. I have already junked 3 wine bottles and a beer bottle. I'm not saying this isn't the correct way to cut bottles, it may be contributed to my lack of expertise.<br /><br />Would I buy this item again? probably not.<br />Would I recommend this item? Maybe.<br />Will I continue to practice? Yes I will providing my source of wine bottles don't evaporate.<br />Is the price reasonable? For what was received, I'd say about 25% too expensive.<br /><br />This is as always my personal opinion.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This is a quick review - but I think the series is remarkable in documenting that &#34;bad&#34; doesn't get decided at once - it is a process.  One can turn back and make changes... one can chose - but here we see the sniff, turn into the nibble, into the whole hog bite.  Very moving - if all TV were like this - I'd watch more!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Terrific DVD for fans of Downton Abbey.  You won't be disappointed with this set of seasons 1 & 2.  Must Buy!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and I didn't see the ending coming until right before the exposition.  I recommend seeing it.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I currently have Rarity and I did not spend any money to get her. I just saved my gems. And you will need either a Facebook account or a game account to get hearts. This is the only thing that annoys me about the game.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This product wasn't made keeping user experience in mind. Plenty of bugs, WIFI reception is bound to be a problem because this dongle has to be attached so close to the TV which is a big hub of radiation. This radiation interferes with WIFI reception and I rate it flaky at best.<br /><br />Google isn't known for being huge on user experience.  Setup is confusing. It took me hours to just figure out how to get chromecast to connect to my network. I started with the Ipad, it didn't work. Then I tried chrome on Linux PC, it didn't work. Then I tried Chrome on Windows 7, it didn't work. Finally, I used the Windows 7 application and it didn't work 5 times, before connecting to my home network. Phew! I consider myself an expert in technology and I had a ton of trouble, god knows how much regular folk's will suffer setting this thing up.<br /><br />Bottom line - if you aren't getting the free 3 month Netflix subscription with this, not worth spending $35 on this device. Go get yourself some beer and wings instead.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|It had a unique story line, but overall I was not that impressed by this movie - though I wanted to be!
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|App does what it's supposed to, press the &quot;eq&quot; button to access the 5 band equalizer, hit the little power buttup up and to the right to minimize the app and keep it running in background. It all DOES work, just not very well in my opinion.<br /><br />Maybe I'm spoiled after using poweramp, but the 5 band eq seems very limited even for a 5 band eq, I figured it would have more effect than it does, but alas it is all but impotent. Maybe the Dev will swap to a 8-12 band eq? It would be perfect for streaming music to my car stereo.<br /><br />I wanted a simple eq app that I could use instead of poweramp as poweramp decides to be glitchy occasionally, what I found was both exactly what I wanted and exceptionally less than what I wanted.<br /><br />It is good for what it is, and nothing more.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game! I love all the options, and freedom. There's a lot to do, and its like having your own real horse!!
006056251X|5.0|I loved this book!  It is easily one of my favorites (and writers) in this genre.  Lisa Kleypas is a great writer, and her characters and stories are always well developed.  The tenderness and love that grows in the hero's heart did positively made me fall in love with him.  Go ahead, read this book and see if you don't agree.
B0015XAT3Y|5.0|Elementary school is were I was when I first began my love of music. It was the 1970's and my older sister bought A New World record by ELO. I loved Telephone Line and could listen to it and the rest of the album again and again. I bought the next two albums, Out of the Blue and Discovery myself. Later my tastes changed and when CD's came out the only album I bought on CD by ELO was a greatest hits collection. Recently I've gotten nostalgic and the latest ELO greatest hit collections just wouldn't cover it. I've now purchased A New World Record, Out of the Blue, Discovery, and Eldorado all by ELO. I also purchased Greatest hits from STYX and Supertramp. Been enjoying them all in the 6 disk changer in my car and digital downloads came with all so listening to them in the house on my computer. Love it.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although I don't normally read these types of books, I'm a stickler for a love story and that's what this is with a  whole lot of edgy sexual stuff.  Very good read though although too much cuss words.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A touching and moving book that left me with soft tears and a strong sense of hope in the end. Loved the interwoven stories reminiscent of a colorful tapestry. A bit slow at times, not every story as engaging, but it comes together beautifully...each 'fabric piece' important after all, falling into place. A true treat!

140006922X|5.0|To put it simple, the VAST majority of people I meet who consider themselves religious, and that's Christian, Jew or Muslim, really only have a very general knowledge (if any) of Roman and Jewish history, the Old Testament, and the geopolitical environment of that region of the world at that time.  Most only know what they hear in church or from a televangelist, and most don't care to know anynmore, and unfortunately contemporary ministers and churches seem to want it that way.<br /><br />The author ties all this together nicely, so you don't have to read the entire 20 volume Antiquity of the Jews by Josephus etc to get a grasp of of all of the above by the end of this book.  Throughout the book you'll have many \\"Ah ha\\" moments where you say to yourself, \\"Oh, OK now the Bible makes sense, why this happened, or that happened and logically yet.<br /><br />If you're wanting to discover the history of Jesus, his followers, the Holy Land, and make some sense out of how and why Christianity grew and spred, then read this book.  If you want to hear about alot of superstition, supernatural, and end times prophecy then turn on a televangelist.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|Well, I don't think I'd like to live in this neighborhood, but it sure is interesting to visit!  The opening of the book has an assassin waiting for his victim in the local park; then we go back in time to lead up to that scene.  The characters start out as people you'd meet anywhere, and gradually take on darker aspects as you try to figure out who might be killing whom and for what reason.  Plot twists keep piling up and the author gives a lot of hints that lead in different directions so that even if you think you have the answer to this mystery. . . no guarantees!  Enjoyed it immensely.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Funny, not boring, good ending.  For some reason I need to have 15 words so hopefully this text will fulfill that requirement.

B00ECUARO8|5.0|A good story needs an interesting plot and interesting characters. Mud has both, and the acting is strong - all the way from Mathew McConaughey to the two boys, their parents, Reese Witherspoon, and the always dependable Sam Shepard. Set in the river country of southeast Arkansas, the film is rich with local color and gives us pause to reflect on love, loyalty, coming of age, and overcoming adversity. Well worth the watch.

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|\\"Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems\\" is a companion book for \\"Peter: A Darkened Fairytale.\\" That first book was as imaginative a novel as they come, a trippy ride and a delightful story. However, let's imagine for a second that \\"Darkened Fairytale\\" does not exist, and judge this book on its own merit.<br />As the title implies, it's a collection of poems, that I feel are best described by the following lines:<br /><br />The man once said inside my head<br />A house of haunted rhymes...<br /><br />\\"Haunted rhymes\\" indeed. In a very British literary tradition, William O'Brien squeezes a stream of consciousness into the confines of a rhymed verse, while keeping it simple and accessible. Let's take a look:<br /><br />Oh, what a little light<br />That shines through those tiny eyes<br />Twinkles like starlight<br />High up in the skies<br /><br />While you might not know what the poem is about from this little bit, you most definitely feel the picture being drawn just from these four lines.<br /><br />Or take this one:<br /><br />Coastal cliffs and mountain skies<br />Treeless country you will find<br />Watch out sprites, children too<br />Talons are jagged wrapped around you<br /><br />The feeling of danger is palpable, the picture of the world where this danger lives is present, and we know towards whom this danger is directed.<br /><br />I think my favorite verse is this one:<br /><br />Moonlight spreads throughout the land<br />Feeding glow bugs sets the plan<br />Fingle grows and shines so bright<br />Telekinesis works just right!<br /><br />I am not certain as to why, but it does tickle me just right.<br /><br />A very good collection of fairytale-inspired poems, both kid and adult friendly, with some nice twists and \\"Aha!\\" moments, especially for those who already read \\"A Darkened Fairytale.\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Yesterday I finished Hopeless.  I was so affected, I could barely function at a party I attended with my husband last night.  When we got home, I immediately began reading Losing Hope and became swept up in the beautiful, heartbreaking, amazing story, told through Holder's point of view.  I finished it tonight and with tears in my eyes, started re-reading Hopeless...Damn!!!!! The best word I can use to describe this story...BRUTIFUL...
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app is truly amazing. I play zoo games like this all the time but  I love the Jurassic park movies so this makes it better.
0981951252|5.0|So many good points I decided to order the book as well to highlight and write them down.  I strongly recommend this book.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|The author has woven a dramatic and powerful vampire story. Luna Sanguis (Luna Series Part1) by Simon Okill, is an eloquently written tale laced with tragedy, desire, violence and love. There are many surprising aspects to this dramatic and powerful story. There is also something eerie and hard to describe, like an invisible mystery written between-the-lines that only exist on an ethereal level - not sure how the author achieved this but it adds an exciting, unseen texture to the book. Recommended!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|I am writing this review without reading first the other reviews.  Normally I read reviews before I start on a book, but in this case I am reading it for a book club and wanted to make my own assessment first.  For the first maybe 75% of the book, I thought it was possibly the finest book I ever had read.  The author certainly knows how to write, he knows well the English language and his descriptions of people and events and happenings and topography and relationships are so delicate, so creative, so poetic that they are almost indescribable.  And I was so taken with his interrelations with and love for Khaderbai and Karla and of course the wonderful descriptions of Bombay and life in that country, and the people who inhabit that world, both the of good life and the life in the slums.  And I didn't even mind the repetitions of descriptions and events because they were written so well.<br /><br />And then.......... and then approximately 75% through the book we come to the war in Afganistan (no, not the war we were having recently, but a war of criminals and thieves) and there the book fell apart.  It went from this incredibly poetic story to an action/adventure war story and the protagonist turned out to be a common thug just like the rest of his compatriots.  What happened to the Linbaba who cured the ill in the slums?  Whose ideals were friendships, not with criminals but good souls like Prabaker? We now have a Linbaba who fights and almost kills people for mafia turf wars.  And then the plots got too contrived and too convenient and unbelievable.  The only part of this last section of the book that I liked was when he got back to his original themes and stops writing about this \\"war\\".<br /><br />I read that there were 13 years between the beginning of the writing of the book and the end.  I can believe that because this is two different books.  One, a wonderful enriching book of a soul finding his way through life and love and the other a callous description offights and killings and stabbings and mutilations, etc.  I do think he always knew what the ending of the book would be, because for the last few pages then he gets back to the original themes of the book.<br /><br />The hardest part of reading this last 25% (more or less)is that this book is incredibly long.  As I read it in Kindle size I don't know how many pages, but someone said 900, so that 25% of 900 is 225 pages, almost as long as some books. I really wanted to just skip to the end, but because I was reading this for a book club I could not. I would recommend that people read the first 75% and then skip to the end if it gets too boring.  You won't miss much except for his writing skill (which is excellent even when he is describing action war stories).<br /><br />I had to almost laugh when I got to the end and he meets again Prabaker's parents and they call him Shantaram.  It had been so long since I read what that meant, so I searched for the reference and came up with Man of Peace or Man of God's Peace.  I really had to laugh, because the end part of the book had absolutely nothing about peace, only criminals and criminal behavior and fighting and everything which we associate with evil behavior.<br /><br />I would have to retitle the last part of the book as Thugs with Honor, or Honor among Thieves.
0061353248|2.0|I found this book pretty predictable. The studies and findings weren't at all shocking; most of the info was common sense. I also thought this was dumbed down as it dealt very little with brain science and sociology and just reports the results of studies on college kids.<br /><br />I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow instead.
B00821OX98|5.0|Best SciFi series in a long time. Well written and actors do a great job. Great alien make up. Don't miss it.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|Author William O'Brien has created a whimsical companion book to his Peter: A Darkened Fairytale, but this collection of enchanting poems (Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems ) can also be enjoyed for its own sake. The author seems to dance with words taking us to magic places again and again.<br /><br />\\"Frozen Magic\\"<br /><br />Land of snow and sleet did find<br />Peter's world was once blind<br />Spells of witches, sacred fire<br />Skies explored flying higher<br /><br />And to \\"Wildflower Valley\\"<br /><br />In the magic blades of green<br />Ladybirds, spiders will be seen<br />Creepy-crawlies spangled dew<br />Plum-lipped fairies tiptoe through<br /><br />He also introduces us to elves and dragons and many other clever characters. Most of the poems are like visiting a dream and they do what poems are supposed to do - transport our thoughts and moods to possibilities as yet unknown. This small book contains large volumes of pleasure - highly recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is very very fun I wasn't expecting such a good quality on this game but I am enjoying it very much
1451626657|5.0|It was hard to get into this book. I read the rave reviews in the front of the book, and after 50 pages I was like, \\"Really?\\" But I gave it time and it got so much better. It's hard to read at first because the author introduces so many characters and moves so much in time. But once you get used to all the zany characters and their nonsensical characteristics, it becomes a pleasure to read. I do think I would appreciate it even more the second time around.<br /><br />This reminded me a little bit of some Vonnegut I've read. It's funny (I laughed out loud a few times), but really, it's dark. Characters die left and right, and there's just no rhyme or reason.<br /><br />I understand now why this is a classic, and I'm so glad I finally read it.

006224454X|4.0|A fun quick read. I loved the twists. It was cheesy and over-dramatic at times, but for a suspense book it was engaging and well-written. Plus you can't beat the concept, which is so close to feasible that it adds a creep factor.
140120841X|5.0|We are Anonymous. We are legion. We do not forgive. We do not forget.<br /><br />As a fit young anarchist male, this Graphic Novel really inspired me and I credit it for making me who I am today.<br />My only complaint is that (**SPOILER**) V dies at the end . How could Moore do that to us?? Also, don't watch the movie, it's TRASH. Alan Moore didn't want his vision to be ruined by the Hollywood Machine. Natalie Portman was hot though, so I'd give it about 3/5 stars.<br /><br />Basically, read this Graphic Novel. It will CHANGE YOURE LIFE

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I was given a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say reading \\"Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems\\" is a more like a wonderful gift, because I loved them all!<br /><br />Nothing makes me happier than poetry, and the enchanting poems in this collection I will read over and over again! Having loved the magical story, \\"Peter: a Darkened Fairytale\\", I was already pleased to read more from the very talented, imaginative, William O'Brien. This collection of poems is an excellent companion to the book, but also a must have for any lover of fantasy and poetry.<br /><br />These poems made me smile, my eyes water at times and transported me far away to a whimsical place. I still have a huge grin on my face from my little vacation! As with his other tale about Peter, I will be reading these to my children at night. I was so touched by these beautiful poems, The Gift, perhaps being my favorite. I look forward to more releases from this truly gifted author!
B007CFL4WO|2.0|The synopsis of this book is intriguing. Other than that, I knew nothing about this book and had no preconceived notions.<br /><br />This comes across like a summary of itself, or like a choppy novella. It was pretty boring. The trial, which is supposed to be central to the story, does not occur until halfway through the book. The trial was not at all suspenseful, just flat, like most of the rest of the plot. The romantic relationship was neither heart-rending nor interesting. It was just there. The protagonist is lame, almost lethargic, despite his rather exciting life. The ending was predictable.<br /><br />I was surprised that this was about Nazi Germany. I found it interesting seeing that form a young German's perspective.<br /><br />I can see that this would make for a beautiful movie - the movie must have imagery that isn't shown in the book, and plot points that aren't delved into. But the book was just flat.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great movie! The start of a wonderful franchise.  A very innovated movie concept, with good actors.  The only actor who is a bit less that convincing is the boy who plays RA.

0156027321|2.0|I loved Part 1 of this book. Reading about zookeeping and religion and Pi's early life was fascinating to me.<br /><br />But Part 2 was a waste. It was pretty much 40 chapters of graphic descriptions of animals dying, or being hunted and butchered. I could get past that if it were a few pages, or even a few chapters, but that's really the only plot that was happening for over 100 pages. What a waste, given the totally unique setting.<br /><br />The end was interesting and made me glad that I had suffered through the middle part, but I was disappointed overall and wouldn't read it again.

B000GCFY0I|5.0|I have read the \\"Uglies\\" series before when I was in high school.

B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This Secret Society was a nice and challenging game. I always enjoyed Mist. You should try it out when you have some time to learn the navigation of this game.
B001SRC9P8|3.0|I read this for a challenge as my book that a TV show is based on. I've never seen the show.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this, even though I know I'm too old for it. I think I enjoyed it more now than I would've when I was the appropriate age, because that's just not what life was like for me (and 99% of the population) as a teenager, even though like the characters I'm a girl who grew up outside Philadelphia. Yes, the girls are overprivileged and talk a lot about their designer clothes, but that stuff is essential to that kind of clique (which probably also would've irritated me as a teenager).<br /><br />Reading this sort of felt like watching Gossip Girl, which probably enhanced my reading experience. This isn't literary genius, but the story is told in a compelling way and the situations and dialogue are believable. I read it in a couple hours and will probably read the next book in the series too.

0812550706|2.0|Ender is a precocious 6-year-old who is summoned by the government for training to fight an alien race humans bested decades before. He is removed from his family and friends, permanently, after the government monitors him with a cool device implanted in his head for a couple years. Eventually, Ender and the other children he trains with will have to put their battle skills to practical use.<br /><br />Ender's brother is a sociopath who tortures squirrels and plans world domination. Their sister loves Ender. She's super-smart too, but mostly lives to serve her brothers.<br /><br />I kept wondering why Card made the characters children; they are children in age only. The stilted dialogue sounds like it's between middle-aged British men. They end sentences with \\"you fool!\\", keep their emotions in check (most of the time) and ruminate on adult concepts. I could buy that in this future world children are just different, but the kids keep announcing that they're just kids. Card makes such a big deal out of it that I know it's supposed to be crucial, but I think it's just a trick to make kids relate to the characters. There's a part where Peter and Valentine (Ender's siblings) are talking and exclaim something like, \\"We are going to take over the world, and we barely have pubic hair!\\" Valentine is also quick to point out (to her brother, mind you) that she doesn't even have her period.<br /><br />I sort of pulled for Ender, but he was hard to relate to because there is no actual human like him. He is the same at 6 as at 20-some when the book ends. He is smart and works hard, but I just don't believe he's real. The scenes in which he is commander are especially unpalatable - no human being talks like that.<br /><br />I didn't care much for his parents or for Valentine. The military higher-ups are talking heads. Peter is creepy and promising in that way, but the B-story about Pete and Valentine is slapdash. Even the main story comes to an end pretty suddenly. There are other loose ends in the beginning that seemed important but were dropped.<br /><br />Most of the action consists of battle and game descriptions, which I found tiring.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't like sci-fi necessarily to begin with, but I can like anything with good characters and a solid storyline. This just didn't do it for me.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is really addictive game. Don,t mind waiting for the energy otherwise I wouldn't get anything else done. Well worth downloading
B00ATPVA78|4.0|I just got started on this game, but so far, I like it. Good graphics, easy to see. I am looking forward to playing the rest of the game.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for my math.  I'm in elementary school and I really need a calculator in school and for homework. This is a cool calculator.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|great disc nonstop kick ass music, recommend to any fan of five finger death punch. quite possibly their best yet
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Maybe I expected too much, but the thing does almost nothing. Basically, it will fling netflix and youtube videos on your big screen and that's it. I don't have a netflix account. I don't care all that much about youtube. I was mostly interested in it for casting internet from my tablet. Except that doesn't work at all. It is impossible to install the chrome cast extension on my tablet for reasons that are unclear. Clicking on the link that should take me to the download redirects me to a page that lacks the necessary button. Going straight to the google store tells me that my OS is not supported, when it's google's f'ing OS! I can get it to work on my desktop, located one floor up, but why bother?<br /><br />Unless google increases the number of compatible apps, above a whopping 2, and pretty fast, then this is a completely useless piece of dook. I'll add stars if in the near future it turns into something other than a dumb waste of money.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Could not put it down......a truly deep, thought provoking subject ....extremely well written and easy to read.  A book that will stay in my mind forever.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Sure, there are serious moments, but I think there was a note of comedy even in them. If you liked 'North to Alaska' you will love 'McLintock'. It's one you will pull out of the movie case and watch again and again. PAY ATTENTION !! you will most likely see or hear something you missed before.  Try turning on the captions, I have found that I will discover something I missed without them.
1781162646|2.0|What was King thinking when he wrote this?  Not much!  Zero suspense, zero thrills.  However, if you like tear-jerkers, this is definitely for you.  Otherwise, the book is simply nothing more than a waste of time.
B004N6369Y|3.0|Typical Danielle Steel - either you like her style or you don't.  There are always round-about words that finally take one to the central story.  I keeping reading Steel, so I must like it!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|If you liked the movie youll love this game. It's a amazing game. It does glitch some times but its awesome.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game on my kindle. You get to play with your friends and go to the different rooms. You can meet new people.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think think this game is addictive and worth downloading and I would like to recommend this game to lots of people
B009NYF2ES|5.0|This review is primarily for the blu-ray picture quality, sound quality, etc.-- not for how good the story or acting is. \\"Cabaret\\" has an excellent HD picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's sharp enough, considering that it's a 1972 film and has a soft layer of grain (as it was photographed originally).  The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Great job on this classic film's Blu-Ray picture, it has fine HD quality for a 1972 film, clearly remastered with care.<br /><br />The story is terrific, it is a classic, great movie, and technically not really a musical.  As noted in the film's SEVERAL extras (several documentaries) included on the disc, the musical numbers were intentionally confined to the Cabaret only; at the time, they felt that audiences no longer felt that characters singing and dancing in the streets (as in Rodgers and Hammerstein films) was believable, after the turbulent 1960s.  This fact was quite enlightening to me.<br /><br />One of the great movies ever, outperforming nothing less than the first, \\"The Godfather\\" at that year's Oscars.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended on all counts!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love this game sometimes it freezes but other than that love it. I would like to see more B options. Like maybe free ones when you level up and not so many limits are girting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much it is awsome i play it all the tine almost every day this game is s
1419705644|3.0|I loved the book! Every Adventure Time fan should own one. It made me laugh, and I even learned some new stuff from the series. But even with all the funny stuff in it, I still feel like something is missing. I feel the pages could have been filled with more creative stuff. Instead of having pages like &#34;instruction to the instruction&#34; and &#34;please help me, a wizard turned me into this page&#34; I would rather have more meaningful pages. Also, I would love to see a sequel where the book focuses more on the later episodes, because this book focuses mostly on season 1 and 2. I love Adventure Time, and I love this book! I do not regret buying it, it's a magnificent piece of paper full of genius and funny stuff, but I feel like the book could have been more throughout.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This review is for the blu-ray picture quality, sound quality, etc.-- not for how good the story or acting is. \\"Taken\\" has a beautiful picture, with very accurate colors (as with the flesh tones, for example), vivid colors, and it's very sharp.  The audio is excellent as well. I'm very pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />GREAT job on this film's Blu-Ray picture, just beautiful HD quality. One of the best blu-rays, quality-wise, that I've seen!<br /><br />Totally engrossing, fast-paced, spellbinding action movie, too.  Truly one of the best movies made, of ANY genre, since the year 2000, in my humble opinion. (Generally, I'm not even into action films.)  Liam Neeson, and I'd guess perhaps a double he may have had, are incredibly good-- looking really talented, very believable, at fighting (usually against men with weapons!)-- in the several fighting scenes.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Awesome album from start to finish. Didn't realize how many of their songs I already knew. Think ill have to buy other albums of there's now

B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever it is not a waste of money love the updates good graphics and love the minecraft realms
B00D67DI9O|4.0|Music is such a subjective thing, I don't really feel a need to bore you with details of what I think.  Modern technology gives you the option to hear samples before you purchase, so you know, take advantage of that.<br />If you're familiar with Austra and liked the first album, you'll most likely enjoy this as well.  (I do like Feel it Break more).  Songs I repeat most:  Painful Like, Home, Reconcile.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very good addictive puzzle / hidden object game, only fault is it can be frustrating waiting for energy to regenerate if you choose not to buy it.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|Okay, all of the reviews are bad because of the cash and stuff, I I hate  it's bad but in the new updated version, they made it so you can get a crapton of bits fast and one gem per level. You did good, gameloft. You did good.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book shows us another part of the world besides Westeros, a part of the world where Westeros is considered a savage place. Some news characters, much more action!
B00EEDJM2Q|4.0|Makes you use your thought processes.  Not just another mindless game/  Can be a little frustrating, but in a good way.
B00506NRBS|5.0|I simply love the way Derek writes - honest, unpretentious and straight to the point. He easily engages the reader with his style of storytelling, and you are, at once, invited into his personal space. This book is an easy read and will inspire you to reflect on your business goal and the way you go about achieving it. Above all, it is about the importance of being true to yourself.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wow...I finished this book this morning and I'm still in awe. It was well written, I had a love-hate relationship with some of the characters, and that EPILOGUE was pure brilliance. The secret I pretty much guessed by the 30% mark, but that didn't take away from the story. This is due to the fact of what happens after the discovery is made. I will say that some of the choices that were made by these characters, made me stop reading and ask myself \\"what would you do in this situation?\\" The fact that I even had to think about my answers, is a testament to this authors fine writing. I had my sister buy the book also because this is definitely one of those books you want to discuss afterwards. If you are looking for a great read with realistic characters and situations I recommend you read this book.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|As a collector of movies/series, and, a long time viewer of any Battlestar Galactica topic, I do not regret purchasing this full set.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My children absolutely love this new musical from Disney!  They are singing and dancing around the house every day.  Even the neighborhood kids are joining in role-playing the bikers and surfers out on the front lawns.  It amazes me how genius the creators of this film were to bring this type of music and film to the children of this generation.  I grew up in the late 60's and watched beach movies with Frankie and Annette.  That genre of musical film has been brought to my children now and not only are they enjoying it, my husband and I are too!  There are so many occurrences that we get, because we know they are being pulled from the old films.  Thanks, Disney, for a wonderfully entertaining film the whole family enjoys!
B00AEFYPLG|4.0|I had forgotten a lot of this move.  Pretty good was as I remembered a mind bender.  Did not much like the ending but all in all I enjoyed it. Great addition to my Philip K Dick collection.  I remember when I saw Blade Runner it was a Sneak preview and that was where I heard he had died.  A very troubled man.  Love almost all of the movies based on his work.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Kind of like Luminosity, makes you work your brain. I look for hints online and find all kinds of Factory Balls on line, but I like the original.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I enjoyed the 1st anthology disk.  Lots of very  interesting info on how the movies were made the second disk was not.  It was boring.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Well written, surprising. I haven't seen the movie yet, but if it sticks to the story it should be good.
B004V6BQ3O|3.0|When i picked up sounds or speech, it's not like other shotgun very clear and clean sound, but included a lot of noise, overtone. I couldn't hear stereo effect that much.<br /><br />Using Nikon 27045 ME-1 is better than without it. I can get better input of volume.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|If you are unwilling to explore your beliefs and opinions, then you should avoid this book.  If you are open to such exploration, don't miss it.
B0031RS44S|4.0|His old team are not the people you would mess with if you knew their capabilities.<br />Jack is such a good investigator and just plain dangerous if you push him too far, it<br />was like poking an angry Lion.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|The structure of this book was easy to follow, and the content is simple enough to try and move forward with Tracy's techniques. I cannot wait to try these on my own baby girl!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This program allows for replay with both random and stacked deals. This helps to improve the skills to become a stronger player.  I really like it.
B006W33UC4|5.0|These songs are magic to the body and soul.  Such happy and life giving sounds to heal the mind.  Too bad these tunes are no longer broadcast on pop radio or made today.  This music is essential for making life joyful, hopeful and fulfilling.  The talent and effort that went into each production was masterful.  Such exquisite work focused on full spectrum orchestral bliss.  No wonder the 70's were known as the smiley face decade.  You just can't help but feel good after listening to these tracks.  Anyone who does not agree, does not like clean joyous music and probably has evil in their hearts.  If you can't play your music in church?  Then it is not music.  This is!
B00B9B4IYI|4.0|Happy.  received the product promptly, hooked it up with no problems, although i did have to supply my own ac/dc transformer (could have been included in the box). Performs very well - bluetooth pairing is quick, decent range, very good sound quality. Rocks !

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|it has a variety of puzzles, progressively more difficult.  so good I wish it were even longer.  I have played it on an image and now on my kindle fire.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Every musician or music fan should watch this.  It was very well documented and edited.  Not only does this movie explain the history of this legendary recording studio but it'll give a brief insight into the recording process, the elements, the people and equipment involved. I had been to Sound City in the early 90's and I'm very pleased to see that this place has not been forgotten.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Loved the characters, totally enjoyable for both kids and adults. What a wonderful story line. The actors who voiced the characters were perfect! Great buy for all ages.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Another great book that kept me up late reading late into the wee hours of the morning. Now I get to sleep and dream of what will come in the next book.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I pride myself on being a voracious reader. This is the first book that made me, honestly, yell \\"WHAT!!! HOLY (profanity)\\"...cannot get over this book and cannot recommend it enough!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If I could give none star, I would do it, but Amazon not allows me. And I would not like to spend my time on writing a review on this crap...<br />If you want to read a very handsome man, fall in love with a girl who comes from nothing, read the Grimm. Cinderella story is much better than it!!!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Awesome movie!! Great for younger folks and also great for us 'middle aged' folks too.  Great music!  Just proves that even sometimes good CAN overcome evil!!!
B00AKGG6XY|4.0|This sci-fi film is so much fun. If you liked Total Recall (1990) you might appreciate The Running Man. It comes with 45 minutes of bonus content (which came from the sparse 2004 2-disc SE DVD) and no exclusive supplements. My only complaint is that the extras are fairly light and \\"Meet the Stalkers\\" with character bios wasn't ported over. The picture quality is good but the audio is fairly average.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Audio commentary with Director Paul Michael Glaser and Producer Tim Zinneman<br />Audio commentary with Executive Producer Rob Cohen<br />Two Featurettes<br />Theatrical trailer<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.

B0068FZ0PG|4.0|This is a 2-disc version of Field of Dreams. It is a great story starring Kevin Costner who is a corn farmer in Iowa. He builds a baseball diamond to bring dreams to reality. Great performances, dialogue and plot twists are in Field of Dreams. With over 4 hours of bonus content it is stacked with extras. Universal ported over all the supplements from the 2004 two-disc anniversary edition on DVD. You also get a digital copy.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Tsunami comes to town and everything is turned upside down. What follows the disaster is disaster after disaster under the guise of community devastation, social upheaval, massive displacement of people, governmental bureaucracy, overwhelmed medical facilities, food, water, and transportation shortages. What's more it really happened.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's a pretty helpful app in terms of in-kindle books, like, the ones you download (not the ones from other book apps), for seeking knowledge of word meanings while reading. The one click meaning finding is really convenient, although, I suppose that's credit to Amazon.  On the other hand, in general ways, i find it difficult to use with the lack of content wise distribution of pages. Having to scroll continuously till you come up to the right words and even the location line isn't easy to use at all in the dictionary. But, it's benefits pretty much empower the flaws, so I'm taking it as good.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I am still amazed at the information that is contained here. I am a type II diabetic that had blood sugar problems (wild swings) until I read this and started to cut out the wheat. Amazing, now my dietician is on board and counseling others to stay away from wheat.
1476727910|4.0|An Earth mathematician solves an important question regarding prime numbers, and an alien civilization is not pleased - now Earthlings have the ability to progress toward space travel, and everyone knows how violent Earthlings are. SO an alien comes to Earth, kills the mathematician and takes over his identity in order to find out if anyone else knows the solution to the prime number question. All copies of the research must be destroyed, and all people killed who might know about it. This was a very interesting and easy-to-read book, told in the first-person from the alien's point of view. As he lives as a human in the man's house with his wife and troubled teen, he learns many things about Earthlings and their capacity for love and caring. He grows fond of the family, and develops a very close bond to the family dog. Will he follow through with his instructions to kill? Will the 'hosts' who monitor his every move and give him his powers convince (or force) him to do so? Read it and see!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like the whole time travel idea and I'm a very big fan of dinosaurs but chasing down wounded animals is kind of weird
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I bought this book for kindle on June 5, 2012 for $1.50. I read the book and really enjoyed it. So why more than a year later do I run across this book with a different cover? I started to read about and recognize some of the names. The book now sells for $5.98 and when I went to the page it no longer (at the top of the page)said that I purchased this book. Good book, bad business practice by Amazon!!!!
B004NGYXIM|5.0|As I read many reviews, most of them degrading this album for being &#34;not as good as the rest,&#34; I assumed that they are not paying attention to Maná's Discographical Evolution. This album is different than any others, musically. Although many sit and destroy Sergio Vallín for not having prominent guitar solos, they do not applaud Maná's use of experimental techniques such as an orchestra, distorted guitars, gospel chorus, etc. But, I won't generalize much. I will give you a break-down of the finest details, song by song:<br /><br />Lluvia al Corazón:<br /><br />This is the song for which many characterize Maná as a pop band. The lyrics are Fher's usual poetic imagery, with a feeling of mutual comfort as portrayed by Vallín's guitars. This is very well another classic. Nothing big to emphasize. Rating? 7/10<br /><br />Amor Clandestino:<br /><br />Now here is a song worth noting. Not only do the orchestral arrangements start to flourish, but the harmonical introduction of this song makes your goose bumps appear. The sound of Alex's Drums, Fher's Acoustic guitar and Sergio's symfonic orchestra make this song a highlight in the album. 9/10<br /><br />Mi Reina del Dolor:<br /><br />Here is something new. A very powerful, punk rock song that will awake you just in case the previous pop and acoustic songs put you to sleep. Vallin's guitar solo, although not as broad, has great sound. Here is where the rock in the album start to become evident. 9/10<br /><br />El Espejo:<br /><br />Now, one of the 3 glorious masterpieces in this album! Hard Rock, Rockin Symphony Orchestra, Sudden Stops, Distorted Guitars, and a Bridge of Complex Chords all in one song. Not to mention, it ends with just a sudden, 3-second acapella. A real journey to what this album has to offer. 10/10.<br /><br />Sor Maria:<br /><br />Another of the 3 jewels in the set, Sor Maria is completely contrasting with El Espejo, although has many simultaneous similarities. More Orchestra, but this time,the feeling of a haunted medieval monastery. Did I mention the great message it has? 10/10<br /><br />Vuela Libre Paloma:<br /><br />Despite being a song suitable for the loss of a loved one (unfortunately), this song doesn't reach any of the top 5 spots on the list.  It does have great musical arrangements and synth backups, but it does not fit in with the Rock (or Introductory Pop) that has been trending on the album. 9/10<br /><br />No Te Rindas:<br /><br />A very amazing composition by Fher. Amazing in every way. Amazing acousticly, gospely (?), and rockfully. This is the first time Maná EVER records in 3/4 time, thus making this song worthy of highlight as well. P.S.: The chorus really pulls you into the song! 10/10<br /><br />Latinoamérica:<br /><br />Nice, Hard/Power Rock track. Very Powerful message. This is something that could have also been fitted into the Amar es Combatir album, without doubt. The dynamics (present ONLY on the Vinyl release of this) are out of this world! But, good'ol Mp3 compresses the dynamics, making it sound like just another rock track. 9/10<br /><br />El Dragón:<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen.. Behold, the most NOTABLE and EXPERIMENTAL song of this album! The best song on this album, lyrically, musically, and technically (El Espejo follows). FULL Distortion of Guitars, Drums are amazingly well mixed and engineered, orchestra does more than its best... What else can I say? Check it out!  11/10!<br /><br />El Verdadero Amor Perdona:<br /><br />A great song. But, just the fact that it is after a super, hard rock (or slight metal) piece just makes it outnumbered. Perhaps being placed after Amor Clandestino, No Te Rindas, or Lluvia al Corazon would have made it a better highlight.  9/10<br /><br />Envenename:<br /><br />Just like Latinoamérica, but with a subtle passion-love inclination. 9/10<br /><br />Mi Corazón No Sabe Olvidar:<br />What makes this song great is that it is NOT completely rock, but rather Latin and perhaps caribbean. Some rock touches. But what Maná shows with a song like this is their &#34;awesomeness&#34; to compose many caribbean songs, yet all sound different and have different directions. 10/10<br /><br />Contra Todo:<br />Mix of Latinoamérica, Combatiente (from Amar es Combatir), and Tu Me Salvaste (also from AEC). Doesn't really show anything new. This is the only track from which I question its placement on this album. 6/10.<br /><br />So there you go. Hope that helps. Take it from a reviewer who is a complete audiophile, has experimented with music analyzation of bands like U2, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Dream Theatre, Apocalyptica, Nirvana, and Queen. Is it worth the purchase? DEFINITELY! Not just because you're a fan and want to collect everything they release, but because there are new things exhibited in this collectional album.<br /><br />P.S.: And no, I didn't go to the concerts to listen to their classic, but this album in particular!
030758836X|4.0|Why do people insist on revealing plot points in reviews? Books and movies? Well, thanks for ruining the \\"new-car smell\\" of a book, so to speak. I want the author to introduce me to the characters in the book and story too, if you don't mind! But how do you say 'This is a good book, you should read it' without telling something about the book/movie? Find a way. This is a very good read. Can't wait for the movie. In the hands of the right director, it should be great!
B003TQ50V6|5.0|I remember going to the theater to see this over and over when it first came out. One of my all time favorites.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Love this series! A little more edgy than the Doctor, but not too heavy as to boor me with excessive drama.
B008469DGY|5.0|My husband and I both love this APP.  Would recommend it to others who love the game of golf. Good game.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|No action, horrible script...the preview did not do this film justice, if you want to watch an action film just watch Lethal Weapon over again it would be so much better than this.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|I recently watched 2001: A Space Odyssey for the first time in at least 20 years.  So my expectations are a bit high right now.  This movie was not only in comparison very cheap and little, but was one of the very few movies whose special effects failed to suspend my disbelief.  I don't recall ever before feeling so aware of &#34;special effects&#34; in a movie.  Anyway, I'm no great movie expert, but this one didn't work for me.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love you need it it is the best game in the world you need it. if you like building you will love this I love it you need it now so get it is free so get it.

B0036S4B6M|5.0|I never realized when I started watching OITNB on Netflix that the show was based on a real experience. An experience we all hope to never live through. The book was and was not what I expected. Having worked in a county jail in my younger years, I knew the basics of how she lived. Piper Kerman brought to life the people she lived with. Made them real. Mothers, daughters, sisters. You could almost feel her emotions and trials as you read. I read it in a couple days. Hard to put down. I would definitely recommend this book.
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|You must go beyond the bad reputation of this film and the accompanying legend. This film is epic, Some (very) slow bits but the rest in fascinating
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book, I love it so much. Reading the book is always better than watching the movie. The descriptions were so vivid and too real.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Love it so far and will give it five stars when more apps are able to work with the device
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing book, I love it so much. Reading the book is always better than watching the movie. The descriptions were so vivid and too real.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|My friends suggested this book after another horrible dating experience. I think I have two primary love languages and will seek a partner who can speak both languages.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing book, I love it so much. Reading the book is always better than watching the movie. The descriptions were so vivid and too real.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I tried a few FM transmitters many years ago and gave up.  None of them had the courage to transmit at a useful power level.  This one works well.  It can't overpower a strong local station, but it can completely cover a station that has enough strength to light the stereo indicator.  The sound is better than commercial FM broadcast, a good clear FM station that does not turn to hash after an hour of freeway driving.<br /><br />The player handles folders and subfolders, so the music collection can be arranged without depending entirely on embedded tags.  Sandisk 16G SD works well.  It does index on power-up.  10G of music on a 16G SD indexes in about 20 seconds.  It did not index a PNY brand SD that was working ok in my camera and computer.<br /><br />For my intended use as a replacement for the lame audio in my car, this is perfect.  There's no aftermarket audio available for my car, and I've hated it for years.  Excuse the rave review here.<br /><br />Minor complaints:  1. Clever use of too few buttons.  You may need some practice with the user manual in hand to enter the frequency presets, and then learn not to accidentally clear them.  2. The remote control can't do much more than volume without watching the LDC display.<br /><br />update: SD card indexing is faster than I originally said.  A Sandisk 16G freshly reloaded with 12G indexed in 10 seconds.  Manufacturer says 32GB is max size but I have used only 16GB so far.  Maybe it takes 20 seconds for a 32GB SD.  If it hangs on power-up for much longer, then try a different brand of SD card.
0545265355|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter because she loves the series so much. I price here was more reasonable than any book store and they shipped it when it was available. Great.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Actually I was looking for this application.<br />I didn't find in google play store.<br />Thanks amazon.<br />4 star becoz I can change the skin of calculator.
074401493X|4.0|The guide is great. Artwork is awesome but does lack some important detail if you're looking for 100% completion. Could be better but still a nice guide, keychain is awesome!
B00DQQZNZW|5.0|Digital technology is the PSBs friend. Their new release sounds like a sonic, fresh, digitally recorded update to their 80s sound without sounding tired. And seeing them in concert proves even more so why they have been successful for decades.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is fun to pass time or just to play u can play on and on cause u cant beat it
B008GWOVOA|3.0|A good and entertaining movie.  Kind of like a Twinkie- the creamy filling is closer to the center.  It shows the aliens, if you're into that.  But, I think mystery is better.  Everything seemed more plausible before the creatures were shown.<br /><br />After watching a few seasons of \\"Ancient Aliens,\\" this movie gives you even more to ponder.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great movie with lots of action and a great cast selection. Always been a fan of Kurt Russell in action films and he's well casted in this. The TV series that follows never quite did the original film justice, it was good, just too campy.
0783231032|1.0|This dvd I bought is horrible, so small you can't hardly see it. The worse thing I ever got from amazon. As a matter of fact I threw it in the trash.
B0097GTUCC|2.0|Completely different than what I expected from Duff Mckagan. Not even close to his past work. not my cup of tea.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I pre-downloaded app for my Iphone and the Chrome extension for Google chrome on my PC. When the device came in the mail, I was up and running in 5 minutes or less. I have two issues so far.<br /><br />1. I can't seem to get it to turn on my TV (yes I am using ac adapter), but I think I need to make adjustments in my TV menu setting.<br /><br />2. Most of the cable channel networks (TNT, TBS, USA, etc.) have their online streaming blocked if you don't sign in with your cable provider (I have no cable provider).  The few that weren't blocked sucessfully \\"cast\\" from the PC to the TV just fine.<br /><br />Hoping more apps are coming. So issue number one I can live with, issue number two is a real big pain in the rear!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I have always loved the weather channel. However, I totally and vehemently dislike the new version. I will be unloading it from my kindle fire. I would have rated a five but the new version dragged it down.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|While I had not read anything by the author prior to this, I have read several books in the fantasy genre and expected more plot development and complex characters. The story was somewhat interesting in the beginning but the ending left me flat and the potential for expanding upon why the &#34;ocean was at the end of the lane&#34; was never developed fully.  Good for a fast, simple, fairy-tale type book but it didn't match my expectations based on the strong reviews.
0061124958|5.0|I love the story and the moral it teaches.  My son enjoys it.  The chapters are short enough for you to keep going or stop.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Great hidden object game.  The only thing I didn't like was if you zoom in every time you move the screen , it thinks you are tapping which can cause a penalty.  I liked that you can skip dialogue.
034554398X|5.0|Its Game of Thrones. Its amazing. I just woke up and its Sunday morning. Hail Victarion Greyjoy and the mighty Kraken.
B000AJIF4E|2.0|These were packaged in a fancy box. The headphones sounded tinny, not much oomph. Maybe I would have to increase the base boost, or play with the mid range response, but I didn't want to have to re-set my amp. I've heard better headphones for $30. These are way overpriced.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Haven't had this app very long yet, but so far so good. I especially like being able to check on different locations.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The true story lies not in the superficial world described in the book- it lies between the characters, and it is so enticing!
B007STXHTM|5.0|excellent product ,used it a lot while swimming ,snorkling and surfing.<br />Light,solid and efficient highly recommended, good value,fast shipping.love it.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A very thought provoking and interesting as well.  I laughed and cried....the author continually wondering what next?<br /><br />I enjoyed the vivid descriptions and felt I was there, and wanted to hear more.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|love this game. add me ill help out on your farm and send you gifts :-)....faqaauk...hope everyone has a great day!!!
B0015442YU|4.0|This sequel to Silence of the Lambs, was even better then the original.  As usual Anthony Hopkins did a great job in his role as Dr. Lector. Maybe the one thing I did not enjoy was the amount of blood and gore in the movie. it was maybe to direct and not enough mind playing.  Missed Jodi Foster.
B00A285OOW|5.0|I had now read 3 of his books. They have all been wonderful. I have to find the next in this line.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, I really did, but I just couldn't.<br /><br />This movie is one huge plot hole with no real resolution.  It starts off looking like it could be a smart movie, but it quickly degenerates into bland, boring cliches.  The only redeeming parts are the few cool tricks they do use to get things done, with the occasional, \\"Aha!\\" moment.  Still, there's no real resolution at the end and it all feels too contrived, like they made the movie for the sake of making the movie rather than really caring about the end product.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|hay muchas entrevistas en youtube que hablan mal pero es muy bueno...graba mejor de lo que me esperaba. a ese precio es un buen mic, el maerial es un poco barato pero vale la pena de verdad..<br /><br />interviews on youtube there are many who speak evil, but it is very good ... better record than I expected. at that price is a good mic, the maerial is a bit cheap but really worth ..
B006LSZECO|3.0|None of the characters in this book are likeable, with the possible exception of the sister.  The tough as nails wife who plays with reality, the weak as water husband, who at least grows up a little in the book, and the wife's parents, who created the monster that she is.  This is an interesting read, and unfortunately I have actually know a person similar to the wife's character, but certainly there is no one with which to sympathize.
B0034CNSFU|5.0|From now on, every time you hear the Jimi Hendrix song \\"Freedom\\", you're going to imagine Dennis Leary doing front kicks.  This isn't a choice of yours, it's something you'll picture for the rest of your life.
0307476464|4.0|1Q84, the book that starts as the size of a pin hole, swells to the size of a universe, and implodes into oblivion. I'm frustrated, annoyed, yet oddly satisfied.
B004UNX1LS|1.0|I have tried to play vevo on my kindle fire HD but, it is not working at all. I still have the same videos on here from weeks ago I thought it is suppose to change up to different video's. I am so disappointed at this app rite now because I love beck and it does not work. I guess I will have to uninstall it. I just read a review from someone below saying that they don't know why ppl are saying that this app doesn't work well, it doesn't work different strokes for different folks. I hate when ppl do that some work some don't. Ugh!!!!
B009RX8AQW|5.0|I am so happy to be able to sit and watch this complete season all the way through. And the Blu-ray makes it even better. Just love this series!!!!!
B000063DGC|5.0|I guess you can find detailed reviews on this CD from other buyers. I'll just say it's so awesome to hear Randy's playing in raw! Intense, fiery, melodic and mean solos in every song, love it! A must for a Randy fan.
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Loved the filming and the movie was good too. Not what I expected nor happy with the ending. Worth the money though.
B000069KGM|2.0|The cover art indicated to me this would include the same songs on the original album which we owned years ago and enjoyed tremendously.  Very disappointed.
B005LJK3AC|3.0|I did not get to see the whole movie. The price was good but I think it should expire after 36 hours.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Hey Twitter,<br /><br />Follow Me @best0wed. But yeah I luv this app &amp; the ppl 4Eva. Bye not a hipster @ all.
0140177396|5.0|I am about to read for a part in a play picking a piece of my own choosing. I have selected a page from this novel.  For several years as an English teacher I used to read the book to Junior High students, changing my voice for various parts. It never failed to hush the class and keep them listening, the characters and themes are so universal and involving.<br /><br />Steinbeck perceived something about modern life which many of us who believe in \\"The American Dream\\" fail to recognize.  To achieve that dream you have to be very lucky, ruthless, or at least clever and watchful.  It seems like hidden forces do not want us to find our dreams. For every Abraham Lincoln there are thousands of people who die trying and failing to be a successful farmers, gold miners, novelists, or simply great parents.<br /><br />Intuitively we like George and Lennie and we ache to see these basically good people succeed, but we know that they hope too much, and even their little dream is beyond the grasp of these men. Perhaps the fates are watching for dreams to shoot down, and we should keep silent about them.<br /><br />After many readings I still cry at the end of this one.  Read it as a must if you haven't already.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|exactly what you would expect from a cast of super hero bad ass. Lots of good jokes and trading of catch phrases.
0064471837|5.0|This is one of my favorite books and I go back to it year after year. Sabriel isn't a stereotypical teenage heroine, and it's a refreshing read when compared to most new books on the market today. The characters have their own unique motivations and goals, and even Kerrigor, the antagonist, is mysterious and very well-written. Mogget is by far my favorite character; the cat is hilarious as often as he is somber and is the perfect side-kick to Sabriel and later Touchstone.<br /><br />The magic in this series is different yet logical, and unlike anything I've read before. The Charter Mages and necromancers, along with the role of the Abhorsen leave this book unable to be pidgeon-holed into any of the popular sub-genres of fantasy. The dichotomy and relationship between Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom keeps things interesting when they're close to the wall, from the healthy fear and respect the soldiers around the wall have to the utter disdain for it that is shown by the rest of the military.<br /><br />If you're reading these reviews wondering if you should read it -- you absolutely should. It won't leave you disappointed, and you'll be hungry for the next books right after!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it!  Intense and interesting! Character development is well built!  Our family watches this show together, as my teen son loves it.  Great sparks for discussion.  Startling, but not too scary!  Very violent, so not for the faint-of-heart, but we love it.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|I like hidden object games. reminds me of Highlights magazine. lol. Passes the time when you have insomnia or when you just need to relax.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|In a nutshell, because I don't want to spend too much time on this review, the steering control is very flawed. I realize it is rally style racing which takes place on dirt but the learning curve is far too great to become a go to race game or even a secondary racing game, for that matter. For that reason alone, I am uninstalling this game.
B008AT9XOC|5.0|Just as good as i remember it. I especially loved that they restored the original ending, but the theatrical one could have been included in the special features.
B00338QENI|5.0|This is a very well-written book, detailing the life of the woman whose cells changed more than I ever knew. Henrietta's story, and that of her family, is so interesting. I was hesitant to read this book, since I typically read fiction, but this was a great story. I've been telling everyone about, especially those that I know are interested in biology. It felt like a great character-study on real-life people at times. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes biology. Very fascinating and at times, disturbing.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|These kids on here need to stop complaining about the game and start getting better at rallying...<br /><br />This is a great rally game, bottom line.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was one of the best I have read in a long time. It tells the story of three separate characters; Cecilia, Rachel, and Tess, and their interwoven lives. Cecilia is devastated after finding a letter from her husband that indicates she should only open it in the event of his death. Rachel has to live with the fact that her daughter was murdered when she was only seventeen and Tess is baffled and hurt when her husband confesses his love for her best friend - who also happens to be her cousin. All the character's stories are tied together and the author weaves a truly beautiful tale. It's funny, sad, intriguing, and relatable. Buy this book; you won't be sorry!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I do love it. It was so easy to program my location in for local weather. So much easier and quicker than checking on my computer. As i don't have a laptop it is great to have this information at my fingertips because of the kindles portability.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large keys, fast and easy to understand, goof-proof; what's not to love about this calculator!  I'd say you did a stupendous job designing this app!  I love it and have abandoned my manual calculator, which was not goof-proof.  Thank you.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This was a different type of alien, futuristic  movie. I enjoyed it probably more because it is a love story.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I  love this movie  a  masterpieces ! A really cute movie and all around good family movie too.I like all of his movies.
B001EPYQO6|5.0|Let me first start saying that I don't understand the reviews which criticize the movie in general. The director stated that it was &#34;inspired&#34; by the Iliad, it is not a historic description of the events that supposedly happened 3,000 years ago. Now, I really enjoy the extended version of the Director's cut. It helps to understand why Paris doesn't hesitate to take Helen with him to Troy and why Achilles went to the city in pursuit of Briselles. Again, in this novelesque version of the book. A lot of blood but that was expected. The sex scenes added are enough to complement the arguments; for me, nothing excessive. Thank you for releasing this version and sorry for the Greek cultural purists.
B005COO1X6|5.0|great story to tell around the camp fire. Stephen King is a master storyteller. Love to read his short stories.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|If I could give this book more than five stars, I would.<br />I needed a box of tissues.  Loved the story.  This will be<br />my book selection this year for Book Club.
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I love reading Dan Brown books cause I know I will be throughly entertained. This book started out great a real page turner. I was very enthralled with all the freemason and Shriner information since I  my grandfather was a freemason and Shriner. But the ending just left me wanting more after all the excitement of most of the book. I gave it three stars because of the ending. But would definately recommend especially for Dan Brown fans!
0060594896|5.0|Although it's a thick book and I haven't completed my reading, 'The Success Principles' has exceeded my expectations!<br />This book specifically walks you through to change/goal. It's like having your personal coach!
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|great great... good show old boy and all that nonsense.  um yeah not really one for reviews.  read the book watched the movie liked em both.  I most certainly would recommend it .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome trilogy!  I can't wait for the movie. I hope the movie is just as good as the books. Ke
B0026O475M|4.0|i just wanted to give it a star rating not actually give it a review.  Um good movie, some metaphors could be drawn from the character&#34;s experience and what not.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|An excellent telling of the sad tale of how the 99 percent got screwed, and ...ended up paying the bill for it.<br /><br />The most dangerous people are not the stupid ones, but the smart ones who are spectacularly wrong, because they are much better at providing rationale for their folly. (Iraq springs quickly to mind.) Sadly, because so few understood what the bond markets were up to, the incompetence and deceit were only immoral, not contemplated by the law and therefore not illegal. Sadder still, little has changed. Wall Street's version of the narrative appears to have won the media war.  Makes me wonder what the next crisis will be like.

1603420398|5.0|I love this book.  It's got so many unusual patterns and I love the color schemes it shows.  It has helped me buy some yarns in colors that work together for my lapghan
140006922X|3.0|I have not read the book yet... but... on the in part... propaganda site of Wikipedia... he is listed as a member of the CFR... all should be aware of this and since his family fled Iran after the CIA/Mossad supplied puppet/King... was taken out in the perpetual cycle of programed disorder... anything he says should be read in that light.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Good graphics, enough of a story line to keep things interesting. Only on level 6, but it is challenging enough- assuming it's going to get harder. Samsung note10.1-Running fine. Good powerups.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|Another terrific movie that missed its audience, thanks to a studio's lousy marketing campaign I presume. The DVD had several previews apparently aimed at teenagers, one for a vampire/witch type movie, a video game, an animated movie that looked like a video game. No previews for smart, adult movies. Seems like the studio took this smart and stylish period drama and tried to make it seem like older kids would like it? When it was due to be released the first time in theaters, the Colorado mass theater murders had taken place, and Gangster Squad's release was pushed back. Not sure what happened after that, but it seemed to open and close in theaters without a peep. Many reviews here are negative. I have not read them yet. I like to write my own first.<br /><br />This is a really good period action drama with lots of star power, great acting, fantastic action scenes, and a complex and interesting story. We watched the DVD last night and my husband said a couple of times, \\"I love this! It moves so fast!\\" (Heads up for those who do not like any violence or gore: there is quite of bit of that. It is fairly stylized and creative, but when it happens, it is gory. There are many killings...this is a movie about crime gangs.)<br /><br />Gangster Squad, based on a book of the same name, and based on a true story of a real crime boss in LA, is rich in period detail, including the final credits on painted \\"postcards\\" evoking 1940s/1950s Los Angeles landmarks. The plot, in which chiseled-jaw leading man and stand-up guy John (Josh Brolin) decides he can't let the bad guys win, and puts together an all-star squad of law enforcers to clean up LA, reminded me a lot of The Untouchables; you just love the guys, and pull for them, cheering them on. Their intricate plan to disable the crime machine in LA reminded me at times of yet another period action drama I love, The Sting.<br /><br />Recommendation: Absolutely, two thumbs up.

B00A2H9OZS|4.0|The quality of this movie depends on whether or not you are a fan of the series.  This was a good installment... but, I don't like the way they treated the way he got kicked off the ship!!! The Chronicles of Riddick was the best one to me... didn't even watch Pitch Black until after I saw Chronicles... This one is more like Pitch Black on the desolated Planet with the critters! Felt sorry for the hybrid dog though, but it was kind of predictable what would happen to it... In any case, I liked the movie enough alright... The action - as usual - was good.  This is one of those movies where you are either going to love it or hate it... and... it's clear that he is still in search of \\"home\\" which leaves room for another one.  Perhaps the fourth installment will be a return to the Chronicles format... this dried up planet stuff won't survive another entire movie.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Great musicians playing great music.  This surprised me. I was expecting a lot of showman stuff.  Yes this cd has some of that but what shines through more than anything are the songs.  Just good song righting. I would love to see them live.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Yeah i know it'e the free version, but I'm not going to upgrade to a paid version if they can't get the free one working right.  Half the buttons on the screen didn't work or they opened the wrong menu or they completed actions before I could hit the screen, and the alarm was so soft I slept thru it and I had my volume WAY up.  Removed it from my device after one day.
0064471837|5.0|It's always so nice to see a strong female character who devotes her time to more than chasing after boys. Aside from that, Sabriel is exceedingly different from anything I've ever read before, with a strong plot and relatable characters. Overall, a huge success for Nix.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I really love this app before it erased all my notes.  I checked my appointments and its all gone, erased, disappeared, nowhere to be found.  Totally disappointed.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game o gosh it would make it head turn but gets u really thinking. I would recommend.  This  game  to everyone  it's good trust me
B005C6HGSG|5.0|This is the third Supernatural Book I've read. The others were OK, but this one I couldn't stop once I started. I highly recommend for fans of the show.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|I do agree that the graphics are top notch. Action replay is awesome. But somehow this app has some issues in trying to interpolate the tilt sensor and or touch controls and cars go out of control too easily. I wanted to rate this with 4 stars I really want to as everything else is good. But honestly what good is a racing game when the steering controls are that bad?<br /><br />Even if you assume that the controls are flawed because my steering is bad and move on you will find that the game progresses very slowly. I mean you cannot skip anything. You got to overcome the challenges (And many other hidden challenges) to advance further in the game and that is a major annoyance. With poor controls and same maps and cars over and over again makes the otherwise nicely presented graphics boring too quickly.<br /><br />I am keeping this in the cloud for now. If I ever see an app update I will promptly attempt it again and revise my rating.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.
031620157X|2.0|I bought this for my sixth-grade class library. I read a lot of children's books so that I can make recommendations for my students.<br /><br />So, I wonder if I'm the only Glee fan to give Chris a poor review. Now, the premise is pretty good, and I love how all the kingdoms are next to each other, and there are parts so far that I have enjoyed. I am on Chapter 10 - about halfway through - and this is such a weak book. I think too many people were \\"supportive\\" before this book went to print. Where was his editor? I quote: Alex and Connor (the main characters) \\"were so petrified, they were paralyzed.\\" Um, yeah, that's kind of the definition of petrified. Earlier in the story, when the twins were given the (magical) storybook by their grandmother (a book that had been treasured by generations of their family, apparently), Alex thinks \\"It was like receiving an heirloom from a relative that was still alive.\\" Yes, Chris, getting a treasured family object from a visiting grandmother is a lot like receiving an heirloom from a living relative - in that those are exactly the same things.<br />Last example, when the children are in the storybook land, and Alex is looking at the buildings of the city, she thinks \\"It was like being in a storybook.\\"<br /><br />This is harsh,  but there's an episode of \\"Friends\\" where Joey has to write an official letter, and so he uses a thesaurus to change every other word to a synonym, reducing the letter to gibberish. There's a place or two in this book where I imagine Chris did  the same thing.<br /><br />This is why it's worth having a really good editor. I don't know if there were too many \\"yes-men,\\" or if Chris Colfer refuses to listen to any constructive criticism, but I expected a lot more from him. I hope the third book in the series is more polished (it's too late for the second), and I wish that fewer fans had written such glowing reviews. The good parts have such potential that with some serious attention to writing, this could havebeen a much better read.
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|I do find this app useful in certain tablets & phones that does not have a good Audio equalizer pre-installed by the manufacturer. The best would be to use the default app as it will provide the best compatibility. However there are some apps from manufacturers that only let users modify audio EQ for their on-board speakers and leave the Headphone out & Bluetooth Audio untouched.<br /><br />This was attempted on [[ASIN:B00E0EY7Z6 ASUS MeMOPad HD 7-Inch 16 GB Tablet, Blue (ME173X-A1-BL)]] as the above mentioned need for a good EQ app for Headphone line output was needed. This app modified the global audio characteristics and it allows me to have total control of the sound when left running in the background. The APP does work as advertised. Love the VU meter. The user interface is hard to see for my old eyes I wish developer adds to super size to full screen size or at least add double size. Also a \\"Widget\\" would be nice to add the VU meter alone to any part of the screen.<br /><br />FYI, there are some good tablets ([[ASIN:B007M50PTM Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch, Wi-Fi)]]) which has excellent audiophile characteristics and the built-in EQ app makes it even better. But if the on-board Audio chipsets are 'marginal' there is nothing a EQ app can do for you. If audio hardware is bad you cannot get Audiophile output period with or without EQ. Also the quality of the source audio media also matters. It is not fault of the app.<br /><br />3 Stars! from me as it does what says and works well on tablets which does not have good EQ app.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book is really boring. It takes you up then it just eventually disappoints. Ana`s account of what happened is boring. I wish it was Christian who was narrating
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved watching the entire season on my own schedule.  Great show, but I truly hated the cliffhanger ending!  It can't be true...
B009K0P10K|3.0|I really enjoyed the first season's approach - how they would go back at the end of an episode and show you how Emily did the things she did... they second season was much more drama.  I guess they wanted it to be like all the other night soaps...  Will tune in next season to see if they tone it down a bit - would like more action, less soap opera.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I was surprised to find the date was not correct, it always seems to be reading a day or 2 behind
0073398101|5.0|This book is just so awesome..it has everything that are required for an aeronautical student to build a good base
B00DURGZHW|5.0|I think this movie is this generation's Stand by Me, but really it is more timeless than that.  As I've gotten older, I've found that it is harder and harder for movies to hold my attention the whole time.  Whether I'm watching a certain trope play out for the hundredth time or am watching my thousandth car chase, no matter how well done, it just isn't as magic as it once was.  Despite, or perhaps because of, its relative lack of action, MUD was enchanting throughout.  The acting, writing, music, sound, cinematography, and character development all came together in a way that I found irresistible.  To me, the title of this review was not hyperbole.  This movie was magic for me.
B00168A6KY|5.0|I love Black Sabbath and this is one of my favorite...I love all of the Ozzy albums and the Dio albums! Tony Martin is pretty good....
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd is the film that current day Law Enforcement and our courts of law should really be about: swift justice, fair prosecution, speedy sentencing, and real closure for any victim of crime! Not the continual revolving door that sends violent offenders in and out of incarceration and/or, through plea bargaining, many years in prison (at the tax payer's expense) instead of the death (unburdening of tax payers) they so deserve.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i enjoy  doing the puzzles  picture quality is great when i finish a puzzle i get forced close so cant move on till I shut off game and go back in frustrating but still fun. have trouble putting it down
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is a great family movie!  It's so hard to find a quality film these days, but this one is not only original but heartwarming, too.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|This is the first tower defense game I played, and I am happy to say that it is tons of fun. Sometimes, dragging may be sensitive, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I couldn't complain for getting it for free on the &#34;One free app a day&#34; from amazon.
B00CSYR432|2.0|I own all of Hayao Miyazaki's films and was prepared to buy this even though this is technically his son Goro Miyazaki's film. I was sure that it would be high quality and just as magical as previous Ghibli films. I was lucky that a friend already rented this film so I got to see before I bought it.<br />I did not enjoy it. The movie dragged...and dragged... we even had to fast forward because became so tedious. I don't think Goro Miyazaki has the same talent for bringing out characters, story and music as his father. I also love Whisper of the Heart which is by Hayao which is also a love story about two teenagers but the difference is that story was engaging and warm and sweet. From Up on Poppy Hill simply bored me. Plus if you liked fantasies such as Howl's Moving Castle or Spirited Away, you'll definitely be disappointed by this...so rent and give it a try first...
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|An instant classic.  This is one of the very few movies I would want to own a physical copy of.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so fun if u like to ride hoses or just like them. In this game you can take Cate of you're own hoses, it's super fun. Plus the graphics are great never  blurry. You should get this game!!!!
0064471837|5.0|Ok, so I'm not Oprah... And people don't immediately rush out to buy my favorite things. But in an ideal world, where I am Mistress Dictator of the World (benevolent dictator, mind you....), people would rush out to buy my favorite things. And this book - as a matter of fact, this entire series - is one of them.<br /><br />I've loved these books ever since I first read them in high school and I've re-read them a couple of times since - like comfort food. I mean, what's not to love? A tough, spunky girl heroine (not a fluffy, idiot-doll, like some other ones I've read, whose names are not to be spoken in this context). Romance and mystery and fantasy. Alternate realities. Magic (well, necromancy - but I count that as a form of magic - and as I am Mistress Dictator of the World, it would be dangerous to your health to debate me on this...).<br /><br />And,of course, zombies, if you're into that sort of thing (which generally, I'm not. As a matter of fact, I hate zombies and refuse to interact with all zombie-related things. These books are the one exception to that rule. And that really should say something about how good they are).<br /><br />I won't spoil the plot for you - suffice it to say that it's a cross-world adventure, with a young girl taking the ultimate risks to save her world and her father from an insidious creeping evil. I've always wanted the opportunity to use the words \\"insidious creeping evil.\\" There, I've done it.<br /><br />In any case, I love this book. And taking it from someone who has a vast catalog of reading material stocked inside her tiny, tiny brain, you will too. I hope you give it a chance.
B007XF4J70|5.0|This is absolutely great on blue ray. That are a good amount of extras and commentaries also. Well worth owning!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This was a great Navy Seal book with detail about his time in the field and his time in training.  This just sounds like an amazing person.  This is also a good book for anyone struggling with their Christian faith or drug addiction.  It totally changed my opinion of people suffering from addiction issues.  If it could happen to this individual it could happen to anyone.  Very inspiring book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I know it's a soap  opera, but I don't care. Maggie Smith is wonderful, the rest of the cast is very goAnd, of course, the scenery and costumes are a large part of the appeal of a period piece. The ''Bates' subplot was a bit drawn out ( not the actors' faults ). But all that is forgiven and I have been watching season 3 again in preparation for season 4.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is addicting. Not too hard, not too easy. I was proud of myself for solving the puzzle game!
B004SKHJF2|5.0|liked: simple, easy to use, great hit rate,<br /><br />suggestions: could move into exploring songs in other languages better. still struggles with this a little
B003XVYLDU|4.0|Vonnegut's gift for descriptive writing is screaming, bleeding and hemorrhaging off of each page. A must read. Not your typical war story of the dead and dying. So it goes.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|liked: customizable, cool designs, fast and efficient, does the job well, great prediction, useful when changing keyboard size<br /><br />Excellent alternative to stock keyboard!
B0095H4FAA|5.0|Well I was very impressed to get the book.  Now all I need is the time to read it before I buy the next one.<br />.
B005LJITS0|3.0|I am not a huge fan of DC Comics, but I enjoyed this movie for the most part. The overall story was decent but it seemed very rushed towards the end of the movie when it should have been split into two movies.
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|I enjoyed this book but I was a little disappointed with the ending. The book is set in 1997 when Reacher is still an MP.  There are two occasions when he acts as judge, jury and executioner which I find unacceptable when he has the option of arresting them.  You expect someone working for law enforcement to believe in the rule of law. Executing people makes him no better than the criminals.  Although as a drifter in the other books I am usually rooting for him to take out the bad guy. I suppose it's all about context.  On the whole the book was well worth reading.
B002436WFI|5.0|Humorous, frequently tongue-in-cheek and irreverent -- what's not to like??? Considering this was a British TV series in four or six parts, its production values are rather good. If you are a fan of Terry Pratchett's writing, this is an entertaining way to spend an evening or two.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game I made it all the way to the end and just wish that there was more to play. I have to start over just to have more fun.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|The problem with this disc is that the volume is so very low that it can barely be heard even with the volume of the DVD player turned up as high as it will go.  This is the case when I tried this disc in other DVD players, and still no volume.  I seem to have ruled out problems with the players and have confirmed that the disc is at fault.<br /><br />I'm sure I'd like the product if I could hear the dialogue!
B007T7MIR0|4.0|This is just like having excel on your kindle. You can create word docments and power point presentation. The graphs are good too.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Awesome flick I highly recommend it! My wife even enjoyed it so much that we watched it twice so it's definitely a must see. This thing says I have to put twenty more words to take my review so I just thought I would share this with all of you.
B00AKOB7CG|4.0|It is a great workout if you want to work out at home. It was fun to do and easy.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I loved this music growing up.  To see it in a comprehensive compilation was fantastic.  If you are an Elvis fan you will enjoy this 1973 music.  This is probably his best Seventies music of all.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game it's not like the other gem games this one is great. You will love this game plus when I give this review I get 3 free gems.@
B0017SWPXY|2.0|To be fair, no book really had a chance.<br /><br />I just finished reading Dostoyevsky's swan song, his masterpiece &#34;The Brothers Karamazov&#34;.  It took me about 4 months.  It's long and eloquent with a philosophical and oft confusing storyline.  It requires your enitre brain to read.  None of these can be used to describe The Art of Racing int he Rain.<br /><br />The Art of Racing in the Rain seemed like a 4 year old wrote this.  I raced through it in about 2.5 hours.  I love that it's a story through the eyes of a dog, and it could have been pretty powerful but it wasn't.  The first chapter made me cry and I thought that this book was going to be very emotional for me...but it wasn't. It was very simple, too simple.<br /><br />It was so close but just wasn't...even close.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I have really enjoyed this app. It is not just another tile game. I have been totally drawn in. I highly recommend this app.

B00CPWTRAA|5.0|That Pl&aacute;cido Domingo is singing at all at age seventy-two is remarkable.  That he does it so well is nothing short of astonishing.  Apparently unsatisfied with being one of the finest tenors in history, he has begun an aggressive quest to recast himself as a baritone.  And although he has already sung Verdi baritone rôles on stage (Traviata, Rigoletto, Simon Boccanegra), some of which have made it to DVD, this is his first recital to appear on CD.  The results are genuinely surprising - and quite good.<br /><br />Domingo sounds much more like a baritone here than in previous recordings.  When the voice lightens and the tenor timbre shows through, Domingo manages to compensate with the sheer beauty of his singing and his magnificent musicianship.  Curiously, on this disc, he seems most convincing in some of the heavier rôles, especially Macbeth.<br /><br />For now, I am perfectly content to put aside further attempts to classify Domingo's new voice and simple enjoy the music.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|From what I can tell it's way better then the first movie. They did a great job making it dramatic with great visuals. Hopefully this director will make another one.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book. Oh man. I was completely captivated and emotionally invested right from the start. The pull that Abby and Travis have on one another is crazy and their attraction is undeniable. I was constantly rooting for them. There was just so much going on throughout the entire book and I was completely invested. I got choked up several times and the words gripping and heart wrenching come to mind.<br /><br />Abby and Travis. Abby kept trying to do what she thought was right, not what she truly wanted. I was thrilled when she finally got it all worked out - I was a bit of a wreck reading this book. I was so drawn to Travis. He was so sweet but at the same time, he had some serious issues - I wanted to fix him. I didn't like all of Abby's decisions but I did like that she didn't put up with all of his crap. I wasn't thrilled with all of Travis's decisions either, at about the 20% mark I think I yelled at my Kindle because of something he did.<br /><br />I love how everything unfolded and all the different layers there were. As far as the other characters, I thought they were great. I enjoyed America and Shepley immensely and LOVED Travis's family. There were lots of different players in this book and I thought they were all well written.<br /><br />There was so much angst and drama, I was on the edge of my seat and couldn't read fast enough. The book had a good pace but there were a few spots that I thought were a bit drawn out. There were also a few things that I found pretty unbelievable but since I was so wrapped up in everything else, I kind of just accepted it and moved on. All in all, I thought it was fantastic.<br /><br />The ending. The epilogue. Oh my gosh! Loved it!
B000J1U0ZK|5.0|Out of all of The Fast and the Furious movies, this one is my favorite; hence, I had to purchase it! With the whole industry of ebooks, instant videos, etc. booming, I figured I should buy this as a digital copy instead, rather than an actual DVD. I like how I have the option to play it from virtually anywhere that plays amazon instant video content. It's very convenient when you're moving from room to room; i.e. watching from a television on a couch, to watching it from a computer on your bed. It makes life very convenient.
B002BRRTUO|5.0|Classic science fiction. Horrible special effects and predictable plot line and queen sound track make for a great movie. Flash!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|excellent book and very objective work!!! It's a very good description of the real Jesus and the basis of Cristianity.
B009AJDET6|5.0|First off, let me state that I have EVERY Chicago album on the original vinyl from CTA all the way through Chicago XXI.  And I also have a USB turntable for dubbing my vinyl albums to CD.  So this was somewhat of a debate in my mind as to whether or not I should buy this 10-CD set.  But now I am glad I did.  As a great Chicago fan, listening to the albums for the first time on remastered CDs, I can hear subtle background sounds, especially with the horns and strings that I never had heard from the vinyl albums.  So it is almost like listening to new versions of their music for the first time.  Well worth the price at less than four dollars per CD.  And several of the CDs have bonus tracks, which is like \\"all new\\" Chicago music to me.  The packaging is substantial, never mind that the double albums don't fold out (as some reviewers have complained).  The covers are faithful and reproductions of the original album covers, and the backs have the listings of all the music on the CD.  The only album that this  presents a problem for is \\"Hot Streets,\\" because the original fold-out cover was a wrap-around photo of the members of the band, and some were wrapped to the backside of the album.  So they are missing on this cover.  And \\"Hot Streets\\" is, of course, the first Chicago album with the members' faces on the cover, and the first Chicago album with a real name, and not a number for its title.  And the first album recorded after Terry Kath's untimely death.<br /><br />So it is well-worth the price.  I just wish other record labels would come out with multi-album compilations of an artist's music.  I have all the Eagles's albums on vinyl, but I'm thinking of buying their multi-album set next.
B00B3MN65K|4.0|I like Josh Groban's new album. Some of the songs aren't what I expected, from listening to his previous albums. However, his rendition of &#34;Falling Slowly&#34; and his new song &#34;Brave&#34; are quickly becoming the most played songs on my phone. Buy the album and see for yourself. This isn't my favorite Josh Groban album, but it's still Josh Groban :)
0553381407|5.0|I am about halfway through this book and it has been so helpful and enlightening for me. I have learned so much about why I feel so inadequate and why my self esteem is so low. I am excited to read the practical parts which deal with how to reclaim myself and to put the responsibility for so much pain back on my parents where it belongs.<br /><br />This is not a book about blaming your parents and maintaining the victim stance. Instead, it is a concrete guide for how to learn to get one's power back and feel whole again. I am so so fortunate that I came across this book. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy. You'll be glad you did and you'll be doing yourself and your children a favor in the long run.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I liked the original version of this app. It changed without notice or options for the old one to stay. The new one is too gimmicky and looks like the animated version of itself. Please bring back the old app!
B00271B752|4.0|Overall very good. Pacino at his best. (Yes, I know, &#34;Pacino&#34; and &#34;at his best&#34; in one sentence is redundant.) It's fun to watch actors  performing in their young, beautiful years who've since achieved the pinnacle. It's not fun -- for me at least -- to watch performances essentially about one good cop vs a whole department of bad cops. Bad Cops cringe me up. For those who derive pleasure from watching films about police department graft, greed, bigotry, insincerity, and xenophobia, it would be hard to beat 'Serpico.'
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Full disclosure: I hate racing simulators and love arcade racing (like the GTA series). This game is neither. The control and physics are horrible. You can't calibrate the tilt, so for my phone (Samsung GS3), I had to tilt it slightly to the right to go straight. The slightest tilt will put your car into a power slide even if the car is barely moving. Whether using the onscreen slider or the phone's tilt controls, the responsiveness is so delayed, constant oversteering is inevitable. I would be in a slow power slide to the right and slowly turn my phone to the left eventually holding the phone sideways and nothing would happen as I slid onto the grass which acted like glue until I came to a near stop. I did 3 laps in the ancient city which has a very narrow, very short tunnel. Twice I found my vehicle trapped sideways in the tunnel unable to escape except by abandoning the race. Zero fun.
0316228583|1.0|I read 250 pages and finally skipped ahead 50 pages at a time, then to the last few pages to see how it concluded. The ending was boring and too easily predictable. At almost 500 pages, this novel could have been half that, as there is little positive character development.<br /><br />The characters are mostly sad and uninteresting. The adolescents intrigue in how they will or won't cope with the turmoil of that time of life. Krystal Weedon is engaging and empathetic, in so many ways the most self-determined of them all despite her limitations.<br /><br />The grownups...they are not adults by any stretch...are petty and selfish, many in failed, hopeless or resentful relationships of their own making for which they take no ownership. I lost track of who was who in their variations on this common theme. Worst of all, a couple hundred pages in I learned I didn't care.<br /><br />I'm a big Harry Potter fan (I'm a man in my 60's) and found this a disappointing waste of money and time. For the incredible creative mythology created in HP, this is the worst of muggledom. It isn't interesting to see how people attempt to ruin their own or each others' lives. I read the paper and watch the news, and see that daily.
B00846REIS|5.0|I felt like it was too soon for him to just confess his desire for her but overall it was a great book.
0345529057|5.0|The books follow the HBO series exactly.... amazing, enjoyable read. I recommend reading the books before watching the series. The four books are fabulous and cohesive as a story.... epic.
1439102732|3.0|This was an enjoyable read; however, the song didn't take me all the way home.  True to the Picoult theme, this novel dealt with not one, but two controversial issues, and that immediately wanted me to take the journey.  The first issue is homosexual couples and their marriage and parental rights.  The second is who gets custody of frozen embryos in a divorce case.<br /><br />In our modern world, neither issue is shocking; but when a woman conceives embryos with her husband, then post divorce, wants them wants them implanted in her lesbian wife, the issue becomes more complicated and takes me further along for the ride.  Add the fact that her ex wants the embryos not for him and his new wife, but for his brother and sister-in-law, and I'm driven right to the heart of controversy at its best.<br /><br />Where the story leaves me off, however, is its all too harmonious ending.  That in itself wouldn't be too bad, but for me, details of the most interesting part of the story were omitted.  (WARNING:  Possible spoiler alert.)  Max and Liddy's relationship was more controversial than Zoe and Vanessa's; but what transpired in the final stages?  What happened to Reid?  Also, what was the purpose of Lucy, and how did she feel about Zoe in the end?<br /><br />Usually, Picoult's novels are so well-rounded they seem to come full circle on their own.  However, this time, important pieces of the story appear to be missing, as if I fell asleep in the final hour of the trip home.
B0053O89JM|3.0|I LOVE House series and I own every season... But this season was not as great as I would have expected.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|My grandson loved the book and the DVD's.  I was able to have next day delivery which made it a great birthday gift.
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|I go into every new NIN album with a hope for the Downward Spiral again, it's just inevitable for me. Now, deep down I know I will never get to to listen to something of that magnitude again, but there is always a small hope. Anyway, Hesitation Marks is now the 28th halo (20 halos after TDS) and a lot has changed from the earlier days of NIN. I was quite disappointed (yes, pun intended) when I first listened to HM, with only a few songs that I sort of liked. But like every NIN album, one listen is not efficient enough to fully understand the album. I would say I've listened to the album about 5 times now, and I must say, it has grown on me. Favorite songs I would say would be be &#34;The Eater of Dreams&#34;, &#34;All Time Low&#34;, &#34;Satellite&#34;, and &#34;While I'm Still Here&#34;.<br />**Sorry the review of songs is out of order from the actual track list.<br />Even though &#34;The Eater of Dreams&#34; is extremely short, is a fantastic start to the album. I would love to hear a 'full' version of this.<br /><br />&#34;All Time Low&#34; is a funky, almost &#34;closer&#34; sounding song with the clean, cool guitar sound and sultry sounding voice of Reznor.<br /><br />&#34;Satellite&#34; something that could be on a more poppier version of Year Zero. Very Electronic, but clean and crisp sounding, unlike most fuzz induced songs found on YZ.<br /><br />Now, &#34;While I'm Still Here&#34; is a fantastic song by itself, if you bought the deluxe edition of HM, you also received a remix by Breyer P-Orridge. This is my personal favorite song on the HM (funny because it is only on the deluxe edition). Anyone who wanted something that sounded like TDS (including me), this is it. A very dark and sinister sounding track.<br /><br />Copy of A is very minimalist, but neat, bleep sounding track. If you are a NIN fan, you have already probably heard this one.<br /><br />Came Back Haunted is another sexy, funky sounding song reminding me of &#34;Closer&#34; (but not nearly asgood). Again, if you followed this album up to its release, you've already heard this song.<br /><br />Everything. Now this song has received a lot of s***t from fans. I have to agree with them to a degree. It sounds rushed from start to finish with the very weird sudden guitar-filled verse (I know Trent does this quite a bit like on &#34;We're in This Together&#34;, but this sudden burst just sounded odd.) Definitely not my favorite track by a long shot.<br /><br />&#34;Find My way&#34; is a great ambient, sad but still optimistic sounding song. Can hear a How to Destroy Angels vibe in the song.<br /><br />&#34;Disappointed&#34; is fairly decent, but lacks any high point. The guitar intruding into the song at the chorus doesn't do anything for me.<br /><br />&#34;Various Methods of Escape&#34; is ok, if your listening to the album as a whole, this song sounds like a filler.<br /><br />God, the beginning to &#34;Running&#34; sounds like the beginning to a hip hop song or something of that sort but it actually turns into a quick, quirky, enjoyable song.<br /><br />Forgot to put this one into my favorites. &#34;I Would For You&#34; sounds like A Perfect Circle mixed with NIN for some reason to me and I love it! One of the highlights of the album, most definitely.<br /><br />&#34;In Two&#34; is another great sounding song, electronic, skinny puppy sounding, with various awesome vocal techniques.<br /><br />&#34;Black Noise&#34; is a continuation of While I'm Still here and a great way to end the album with the fuzzy, disembodied noises we have all come to know and love from Mr. Reznor.<br /><br />The other two remixes on the deluxe edition are kind of whatever, but I would recommend getting the deluxe edition for the third remix if nothing else (hardcover art book really isn't what it sounds like. It is just the lyric book glued into the middle of the CD case.&#34;
0345803493|3.0|I wish I wouldn't have started these books. No substance to the books. Just a little S&M. I was bored reading the first book and read the next thinking they would get better, but it didn't. It was like reading a romance book with a little sex mixed in.
B000WC3AKI|5.0|One of my all time favorites. I guess I'm a disaster freak. Usually watch this once a month and wonder if the will be a solar panel disaster or maybe a windmill disaster movie.
0345803507|3.0|I wish I wouldn't have started these books. No substance to the books. Just a little S&M. I was bored reading the first book and read the next book thinking they would get better.
B000093BDX|5.0|Traditional Songs and sounds in great re-creation. Brings back memories from my time in Southern California. A great starter set for the Beach Boys hits.
B00124BNF4|5.0|Classic music from my childhood! My kids didn't appreciate it but what do they listen to? Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry. No taste.
B009LGO88E|5.0|If you can believe it.  I play monster hunter 3 ultimate and this makes it a lot more bearable.  I found it lets you play a few hours without your hands feeling like they've been twisted into a pretzel.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Works well makes the sound quality of existing speakers much better! You just have to figure out how to turn on the equalizer
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much. I love the crafting, the landscape, and the survival aspects. In my opinion this is the best game in the world.<br /><br />I
B000LPS4BG|5.0|Best movie ever made. Ya know what makes a great movie? Besides the obvious, its a movie you can NEVER remake. Ya had DeNiro and Pesci in their prime with Scorsese calling the shots.<br /><br />The scene going thru the restaurant kitchen where they didn't cut....best scene of all time. The music, the acting, it invites the viewer into the life of a gangster and how they live. All the perks, the upside to being a bad guy. Not admirable but a realistic scene and very well done. Love it
B0067R0APK|5.0|Best weather out there<br />easy to use<br />good forecasts<br />works great on my Kindle HD<br />my wife has it on her iPhone
B005V3WRVQ|5.0|this casket is wonderful , bonus is terrific , soundtrack powerful This short book is a steel bead has not hesitated aquérir
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft pc is awesome! All it needs is railroads and endermen. I love it when I dig somewhere and find diamonds. And also gold. I don't really care for iron and coal though. Minecraft pc also has the nether, but I have a hard time making obsidian in survival mode. I would like to thank Mojang for minecraft. Minecraft is awesome!
B00979CS50|5.0|As a long-time lover of Neil Young's music (I go back to Buffalo Springfield with him) I am prone to like whatever he comes out with, even some of the weirder stuff.  But Psychedelic Pill is definitely classic Neil.  Like a fine bottle of wine, it is comprised of several interwoven flavors -- a heft dose of the Harvest album sound, especially the melodies; a strong twinge of Like a Hurricane;  a heavy dose of electric guitar jam, as in his live performances, some serious rock & roll vibe and some mellow as well.  The songs are all new and the lyrics are up to the moment. Crazy horse is in totally peak mode, jamming hard and tight, perfect accompaniment.  If you like Neil, like counter-culture ideals and philosophy, or just like heavy jam rock, BUY THIS ALBUM.<br /><br />Favorites:  &#34;She's Always Dancing&#34;  &#34;Drifting Back&#34;
B001R10BEG|4.0|If you are into good and original movies you'll like this one, Tom performance is absolutely awesome, I wouldn't be surprised if they do a remake
B004DLPXAO|3.0|It doesn't even display the articles I send my kindle and won't sync the books from project Gutenberg. Really only useful for things you buy from amazon.
B005WMQ5R8|4.0|Action sequences are intense, music is great, story very simple and straightforward it'snot the regular animation look forward to watch more anime like this
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game addicting. Wish you were able to save your progress in each room. Cant wait to see the next levels.
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|Since I'm a Bee Gees fan I couldn't be happier to watch and listen to this (one of the best) live performances
B0040I09RM|5.0|This show has so much drama, excitement and it will keep you glued to your seat! You will have to watch the whole season in one night.
B0035G1K7S|4.0|Viewing is such a great experience however I hoped more; love the way they interact with other people... it's different...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Perfect for the whole family. Really enjoyed our movie night. Carrell is fantastic as Gru. Looking forward to the sequel!
0756655307|4.0|I frequently use it as character reference, every time it's an enjoyably experience, full color pages, the artwork is impressive
0790729369|5.0|This has got to be one of the best.  The plot as well as both Cline Eastwood and Meryl Streep makes it a classic for me.
B000002LND|5.0|Madonna is and forever will be the queen of POP, it's an oldie but lights years better than gagas , nikkis, katys and all hybrids we listen these days
0064471837|5.0|I bought this set of books at least five years ago and i seem to re read them every year, Sabriel is a wonderful example of a book you just can't put down from start to finish!<br /><br />The characters are rich in detail and the way in which is written leaves you completely involved in their lives. I love the concept of the book, this is much better than the usual struggle between good and evil!<br /><br />Reading about Sabriels struggle to accept becoming the Abhorsen and the possible loss of someone dear to her still gets me every time i read it.<br />Well worth the money and a read especially if you already enjoy books in this genre, there is nothing i would take a star away for!
1616551607|5.0|Yoshitaka knows his business, the set is awesome for a fan who loves good art work; for me is a very well spent money
B0066WJLU6|5.0|At first I loved this ap.  Then it kept wanting me to upgrade.  After 2 weeks, it failed to run at all, so I replaced it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This Game is amazing I had the most fun of this game for 15 minutes But I like it more because you could see you friends score
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this application.  I can now log in with my desktop computer and create my favorites folder.  It also allows you to move favorites between folders.  The only thing I wish they would upgrade is the ability to change the order of the folders.  Minor issue really, just something I would like.  Lots of stations to choose from.<br />I listen to this all the time while I'm at work.  Just wish the wifi at work was a little better.  I have dropouts behind some of the concrete walls!  It's not TuneIn, just they way the wifi at work is.<br />It is very easy to use.  I use it on my desktop, phone and tablet.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Shows all aspects of war. Raw, dirty and courage. Shows from the beginning to the end of true soldiers and a true battle.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Love to see what she really goes through and that all this fame doesn't happen overnight. Oh and she's amazing of course!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Best drama since West Wing!!  Pulled us in; we're hooked and looking forward to getting current with the new season!
B006P4FBUE|1.0|I ordered the Mini Piano but I cannot get it on my Kindle Fire Tablet.  It is very disappointing. I must be doing something wrong. I enjoy my kindle very much. I would appreciate some help. Thanks.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Rango didn't give me a time where I wanted to stop the movie. After every scene, I wanted to continue to watch it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is not a bad app for free. Worth it if you like hidden object games.<br /><br />Downloading takes a little longer than some apps out there but still worth waiting.
B003U74NQW|5.0|This is a film that can be seen over and over through the years with whatever new company you might be with, especially if they have not seen it before and enjoy it's perfection all over again. The fact that David Lynch's miniseries, \\"Twin Peaks\\" was a his spin-off of this film makes it all the more interesting.
B0064MGU98|4.0|I'm engaged after the pilot. I wish I would have started at the beginning of the series. Catch up time.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|I really respect and like the band, but am not an aficionado.  Listening to this and their Greatest Hits, satisfies my Pepper's jones.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|The album itself is more or less a standard Whitney Houston album, but in 2009, obviously the style of music has changed and so has she. Whitney as a person/artist basically destroyed her voice because she was over-worked, and overtaken by the devil of addiction. This album is one final battle cry. One final \\"I'm still here\\". As you listen you're pulled into her struggles, into her triumphs, into her life. It's not her final album, It's her goodbye Letter, and I think it's more than good enough.
B0018AM2JI|5.0|I had not drug out my vinyl version of this recording since the early 90's.  It was exciting to hear it again on my MP3.<br /><br />A very intricate, subtly thematic album.  You can hear these guys were working well with each other and not struggling to write.<br /><br />In my experience, progressive bands often sound contrived or forced.  Lyrics which don't flow or are obvious.  Musical pieces which sound like scales or comps of classical pieces.  Not here on Selling England By The Pound.  It flows and moves you.<br /><br />Steve Hackett ventures out of the blues based guitar into his own uncharted territory - reinventing electric guitar.  Tony Banks' keyboard parts are complex, yet entertaining.  Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins vocals interplay perfectly.  The punchy, melodic bass of Mike Rutherford and the intricate drums of Collins are at their peak {and what I feel was missing from the &#34;I can't Dance&#34; era}.<br /><br />I've turned on a few Genesis fans to this album and it quickly became one of their favorites!
B00BESM14U|5.0|Had not read the book or known the storyline. Very realistic as far as the era (late 80's early 90's). This could have been my group of friends.
B00122PUS2|5.0|I always enjoy this album, which is what I think of as their transitional period.  They packed a lot of intricate elements and introduces more catchy hooks into their songs.  Phil Collins was really influenced by Peter Gabriel at this stage, making a wonderful mix of the two.<br /><br />The lyrics take you places and are not trapped with some 'heartache' or 'I am in love' themes.<br /><br />It is really cool to go back and forth listening to this and 'Seconds Out', to hear how talented they were both live and in the studio.<br /><br />Have an original pressing on vinyl and love to have it now on my MP3 player.
1781162646|4.0|As a long time Stephen King fan I always get excited about the next release. I could not wait to read this book so it went with me on vacation to pick up after my previous read. It kept my attention and I neglected my husband a little just to keep reading. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and felt a connection to the main character.  However, when I had finished reading it, I felt nothing. And this surprised me. Generally, I'm left wondering \\"what else happend\\",  or \\"finally....\\", or \\"ok, next book\\" (if it's part of a series), but this was just, over. I thought \\"that's it?\\" I felt like there should have been more substance, more action, more suspense, more \\"everything\\" that is Stephen King. Overall, I enjoyed this book but it was over too quickly.
B00122OTQ6|4.0|It seems as if this album has been forgotten over the years, but I remember when this broke Genesis on American radio.  A crucial turning point from 'Then There Were Three.'<br /><br />I haven't listened to this in quite a while.  First note took me back to the late 70's.  Great album - can't go wrong..
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play this game all the time. It is awesome. I have a world that I have tons of things on it. Download it, It is awesome
B008M87GJK|5.0|Another excellent app to have on your Kindle.  It's actually just a more handy way of visiting this website.  Lots of times computer owners want just one thing and it's not worth powering-up the laptop or desktop.  For me this is one of those things.  I like to tune in to BBC because I don't trust local and national news and BBC News at least broadcasts a different prospective - even if it's not always more accurate.
B000GT6KEU|3.0|Live theatre almost always beats the celluloid screen. Many of the actors here were the same as on Broadway, so they bring the intensity, but there's no substitute to the energy of live action in real time in front of you. Here's what totally redeemed it: the cinematography in and around New York City. That was cool.
1558908382|5.0|Saw this movie in theaters when it first came out and it instantly became a hit with me.  The soundtrack by itself is awesome, plus I love pretty much anything John Cusack does, all the way back to Better Off Dead and the bit role he had in Sixteen Candles.  This movie is sarcastic, funny, and greatly entertaining.  The scenes between Cusack and Dan Aykroyd are hilarious.  A must see!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This is a film for everyone: kids, adults, esp. the jaded cynics/skeptics in your life. For anyone who believes they're too overwhelmed, too tired, too old, too whatever, this is the film for them to say. It's all about the message, and you'll never see squirrels the same way again! :-)
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|Great soundtrack, but more importantly, fantastic acting by Robert DeNiro and Chazz Palminteri.  A complicated story of a working class father trying to raise his kid with solid values, and the kid idolizing the thug on the corner.  Granted, that's a really simplistic explanation, but this movie became one of my favorites from the moment I saw it 20 years ago, and continues to be a go-to movie for me on weekends where I need a DeNiro fix.
B000JZ68GG|5.0|Cult classic. Super sexy sixties. The generation that Austin Powers parodies. The origin of the name of the rock group Duran Duran. LOVE IT!
B002GHHHKG|4.0|A nice romance about the sacrifices some are willing to make for love.  I can never watch it thru to the end w/o crying.  Of course, I'm a total sap too.
B008OOYALE|5.0|love the app! The new dragons are so cool! Although I am just getting started my fav. Dragon so far is my poison Dragon.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. I always loved the Sims on other platforms,but it is really great on the Kindle Fire HD. Can't stop playing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game I've ever played. All of the characters you want you get with coins not money, the game is endless fun!!! Get this game NOW!!!!! It's free, and every month or so, they go to a new place in the world, with a new limited time character from that place. It is awesome.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|Got this for my son's birthday since my kids are Minecraft crazy. I was disappointed when I first got the package as it was extremely small considering the price. But then I really looked at the box and saw you can actually build different worlds with the kit and not just one. My son loved it and immediately set about building all of them. I, however. still wish the box was a little bigger or maybe the price a little smaller.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|I am 52 years old, and I can not say that I am the part of the IT generation. Football, basketball... are the games of my childhood. I never loved this kind, of the games and I never learn to play.<br />My good trend insist on me to try this game. Beginning was horror and I throw away my phone. After a couple of hours I tried again and bang!!! I was playing this kind of a games for the very first time in my life!!!<br />For everybody like me:TRY IT.
0552778095|4.0|I came to this book via word of mouth recommendation and 'The Sunday Times best seller' etc. This can always be a little awkward as you are then almost expected to love it. I enjoyed it and at times couldn't put it down. But I did think that maybe it was a little long at 350 pages. The twist at the end didn't surprise me much I'm afraid, but maybe I'm just an old cynic. The writing is lovely but for me the story lacked detail at times. Some of Harold's dithering occasionally lost me sympathy too,as he sometimes just behaved like an idiot. It's not easy to write a detailed review without it being a plot spoiler so I will stop there, suffice to say that I did enjoy reading it. It's nice to see I'm not the only writer who sometimes uses the weather along with appropriately placed bits of flora and fauna to bind a story together!
B004X80QNG|5.0|I really do not understand the people who expect that their smatphones works like a PC or Mac. This is really good application if you learn how to use it and that is really not difficult. It is very good. You can use it as a calendar, remainder, attach any kind of a file along same event including a photo, doc, off...<br />Anyway I am using it and it is very easy and effectly, because of than I have to recommend it to everyone.
0765325950|2.0|It is unfortunate that Mr. Jordan was unable to complete the series himself. I found the final book severely lacking. Definately NOT worth the asking price . if I were you I would wait to find it at a book fair or second hand book store.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|There are two kind of the EQ on the markets for the smartphones. Firs of a kind demands of you to disable parts of the sistems tuning. The other ones leave you to dicede and that is much, much better. It is working anyway. Only you decide when you wont to enable EQ. For example you will need it while listening radio, but you don't need it alongside EQ in the almost any better players and this is that kind of EQ. Works really grey, and I recommend it as a must have one.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is addicting and fun but they do make it a little hard to complete rooms. I also had a problem purchasing credits. They took my money but never gave me the 40 credits I ordered. Complained numerous times but no response.
034580709X|5.0|Since I discovered Jo Nesbo I have read every book with English translation I can find.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a great read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great graphics. Don't feel like I need to spend money to succeed. Keeping me entertained. Kids like to participate. Good job.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me : minion rush is my favorite game in the world .I love it  plz whoever made this game plz make a Despicable me: minion rush 2 game I love minion rush thanks
B0011XBLUS|5.0|It's simple...The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is hands-down the best western ever made. Chock full of historical inaccuracies, over-dramatised parts, and even some less than stellar actors the storyline is so good, Eastwood is so superb, Wallach is exceptional, and Van Cleef delivers the best performance of his career, that Sergio Leone manages to direct himself out of difficulty, and into cinematic history. The South Koreans adapted the Leone tongue-in-cheek formula back in 2010, making a homage movie entitled The Good, The Bad, and The Weird that is a fantastic movie as well.<br />If you like westerns, you can't afford to miss this movie..or it's Weird Korean brother!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I use this app for everything! I clean my device daily and it runs SUPER fast! This is probably the best app for cleaning your device that there is.AWESOMENESS!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This Kindle Fire cover fits perfectly and meets my needs for protection of my Kindle, and the stand-up feature is a bonus.  It arrived quickly and the price is great.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Time line of this story doe's not appeal to my taste. Other books I would read before Les Miserales as I did not enjoy the story line
B005K17RU0|3.0|Item is not a good product but then you get what you pay for & in this case they were very cheap.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Enjoyed the plot could not imagine being in a situation as described in the book. Is there a sequal to this?
B004DLPXAO|4.0|easy to use and so many great choices. loads easily on my android tablet. even has books for my kids for free
B007Q35PLI|5.0|Brilliant performance by Claire Danes of a really inspiring story.  Definitely encourages empathy and respect for autistic people and their families.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|The game is awesome ,but can get expensive. It occasionally like,s too start over and l lose all of my progress other than that ,it not bad.
B0035OC7PO|4.0|Perhaps this book will  be most appreciated by people of the same generation as  the author as he remakes a trip through Europe that he had made in his 20 ies.  It is true as some reviewers had already pointed out that he often stereotypes the different Europeans after the country they live in but,  so what ! The stereotypes are still valid and they are funny. Not so many things change after 20-30years and they are still valid if.....still stereotypes. Then the book is a very personal one, not a travel book for the voyager wanting to know what to see in Europe. To me that was one of the charms of the book. There are otherwise hundreds of travel guides that one could use when in Europe. The writing is fluid and vintage Bryson which pleased me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I LOVED this book!  I can't wait to read the next one.  What I really can't wait for is the movies, I can only hope they turn these books into movies.  Very well written, suspenseful, interesting.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Lives intertwined from the past and present.  A Holocaust survivor's story comes to life through the eyes of a journalist's eyes in modern day Paris.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play, but after level 10, they make you rate it.  So, the first 10 pretty good. Get your friend's to play with you.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I used to open encyclopedias and read them for fun.  Oh the ideas that would open up for you. Now Wiki makes this same wonderful world available to everyone.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this!  Saves time and is easier to see all that Facebook has. :)  I use this all the time!!
1439102813|4.0|This book was  recommended by a friend, I found it very helpful!  Have not finished it, but I will soon.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is quite fun, but is very short.  I solved all of the puzzles in a couple of hours.  There were some repeat puzzle styles which made the Epilogue level less difficult and it took much less time to complete.  The game is really lovely; however, I think I would rather have had a slightly lower image quality and more puzzles to solve.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Finally not all filler. Well worth the wait. Go Rand...gotta love the ending. I give it full all thumbs up.
B006M3JVD6|5.0|I loved this book, written in plain English making it very easy to read.  The fact that it is written by the victim in her own words make it great, a must read.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lots of fun. Addicting, can't put it down. Never know what to expect around the next corner.<br />Look forward to more games from this company.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was wonderful read! It's was a great page turn er and the author New how to get the reader in! The only disappointing part was the end. Amazing Amy absolutely deserved what was supposed to be coming but never did. I was longing for the book to continue. But I still give this book two thumbs up and should most certainly be read.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I haven't read many Gaiman books, but I did like this one. It kept me reading and thinking. I'm not exactly sure who the intended primary audience is for this book, but it worked as a great summertime read for me.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think the game is awesome so far I have no complaints but if I come up with any I'll let you guys know other then that enjoy you horse
B003ICWTR4|5.0|I am very happy that the Boss could play a concert outside! I have never seen him do that before!
1904633153|5.0|First of all, if you are looking at reviews here on whether or not you should purchase this book...just head over to Good Reads and check out the information they have there. For the product itself...amazing. It even comes with a cloth bookmark as a part of the book which is immensely useful and an unexpected feature. The book itself is quite small, but not too small. The text is a great size, and the content, as always, a masterpiece.
B001L5SXQG|5.0|I will pass this along to my family and friends so they can enjoy and honor the Boss and his band for such great music:-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game you can travel and run<br />Also you can get money and avatars plus miame is the best place to be
B000002B30|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band are the Best!!! I will continue to purchase his products through Amazon!<br />Rock on Springsteen and the E street Band!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Loving this game. It's so easy to play. There should be more games like this to play. Love it so much.
0451166515|4.0|I always loved the movie so I thought I'd read it. ; Holly was much more salty and Varjac a little more on the edge..  Interesting comparison to the movie.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It was like The Matrix meets Grimm&#34;s Fairy tales. Alot of fighting action, awesome moves. Some parts are a little corny but overall entertaining.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Interesting love story if it weren't for the sm stuff going on.  My fault, I didn't know what it was about before downloading.  Probably wont read the rest of the series.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I do not like the most recent app. It seems to be more about show than functionality.  The old version was better.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I was expecting a ending and was left hanging. I thought this was a trilogy! ? The story was hot and steamy and I still would like a Gideon Cross of my own but this was just eh. I'm getting more and more irradiated that authors keep adding to a series. Sylvia Day could have finished this up, left a lot out and given everyone the story they were expecting. I will not be reading any more Sylvia Day. She is obviously doing this for more money, shame on you Day!!<br /><br />I am so disappointed with this book I returned it and for $9.99 I'm glad I did. You can return up to 7 days after purchase you go to mange your kindle find Entwined with You and hit return and refund. I did and I encourage others who are unhappy to do so too!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I was excited to receive my Chromecast today and tried to set it up.  Initially, it had trouble connecting to either of the two wireless networks I have in my house.  After fiddling with the main DSL router, however, it seemed to kick in.  (It may have been when I changed most of the 802.11b Rates(Mbps)options from \\"basic supported\\" to \\"supported\\".  Or maybe it just coincidentally connected at about that time.)  Since then, I have several times gotten it to connect to the network, but it tells me it can't connect to the internet through the network (although all my other devices have no problem getting on the internet through the same network.  In fact I'm connected through it as I write this.)  Afterwards, each time, it forgets the network password.<br /><br />I tried Google troubleshooting.  Unfortunately, they give a limited list of problems you're allowed to have and mine isn't one of them.  There is no way to contact them for other issues.  (\\"Contact Us\\" just returns you to the canned issues list.)<br /><br />I'm a software developer and fairly knowledgeable (though not an expert) when it comes to networking.  I'm used to configuration issues with new technology.  But Google needs to provide better diagnostic tools that pinpoint the problems if they don't want to provide support beyond their canned answers.  It's a pity because this looks like a product that has potential.  But this kind of experience damages the Google brand.
0307277887|5.0|The book is not exactly like the show, though I was not expecting it to be. But if you like the series you will Love the book! As soon as I starting reading it, I knew I would love it just as much!
030758836X|4.0|It does not have a happily ever after ending and that might deter some readers. The language skills of the author are evident and it is a great smooth read.
B00CL66FEQ|4.0|I'm not really sure this movie was truly HD. Next time I'd get the regular version. The movie was sort of funny!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I watched the first season then learned there was a book series, GREATEST BOOK SERIES EVER, but I absolutely recommend this buy.
1450400957|5.0|It's required for a class I'm taking and it's helping a lot as we have to plan out entire exercise routines for clients so it's a good book
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This is a book for teens and tweens. I enjoyed every minute of it! It is like A never ending circle of love hate and sadness that will keep you on your toes! Till they magically finds the end.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I loved this movie growing up and I'm glad I could finally buy my own copy. I definitely recommend this
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is fun to play and easy too. The only problem is that sometimes It takes at least 5 minutes to load. Hopefully this problem will be fixed
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|For a couple bucks you can't beat this app. Works very well with the Kindle Fire HD. Lots of color and the availability to be very creative. It gives you a great many colors to chose from, brushes in two sizes, crayons, marker pens, colored pencils, stencils and digital stickers. Easy to use for any age child.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|Love his style and sound. Album is very enjoyable. Eleven more words are required, but I am not writing any more.
B008M721MS|1.0|Doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD.  I can't log into it.  It keeps telling me my password isn't valid.  Sucks!
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|This is a good faotd for my kindle fire.  The graphics are amazing and there is no lag in play.  I opted for the on screen controls rather than the tilt steering.  There was a lot of drift but that is to be expected in dirt track racing.  I am not a racing game fan but this is a nice game overall.
0316010669|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. Gladwell makes a compelling case for something that is erstwhile immeasurable: intuition.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having trouble with the orginal usb cable but once I received a new one along with the kindle powerfast charger my problem was solved.The accelerated charger does make a difference
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book met all of my expectations, and it was free! Very interesting and was hard to put down. Awesome!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is a great way to increase productivity.  To see full benefits be willing to try some of the add on's you need to pay for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very good game to play on the kindle my kids love it that's all they play thanks
0061122416|4.0|Very enchanting... I could read that book over and over again!! I fell in love!!  I love Paulo Coelho he's amazing...
B0050DZN4K|4.0|It does exactly what it says on the tin. It has a hard time with some of the formatting, though.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I just love this you tube downloader. It makes it so easy to see videos on the go. I can see my favorite artists performed. It is almost like being there at a concert.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put it down...I all three books non stop in two weeks. Be prepared for the unexpected. I hope there are more to follow.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This album is just the best album she has made yet. It shows songs about her recovery just like Unbroken did, but this one goes into more detail and it also shows how she is now completely recovered. I love all her music but this is by far the best album.
0142000655|5.0|I had not read a John Steinbeck book for many years and had forgotten what a wonderful writer he was. There is a reason that he is held in such high esteem in American literary tradition. This book is one of epic ambition brought to life by a bevy of rich characterizations and wonderful imagery. The book also has one of the greatest literary villains of all time (Kate) who can not be rivaled in vileness and cold nature. The main victim of her venom is the innocent and naive Adam Trask who is her principle patsy. This book is way more than this -= the depth of plot and character development is astounding. Some modern readers might find the story development a little slow in spots but overall I can not see why any person would not appreciate the greatness of this book.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It is a fun game but it does not tell you the instructions for instance it will tell you to do something but it wouldn't tell you how to do it but even if it did tell how to do it has bad instructions
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Started watching at home on sony bd palayer and fell asleep.  I picked up where I left off at work that afternoon on my ipad to finish.  Movies throught amazon are just too convient.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Great book, a wonderful story that just keeps you wanting more. Great plot twists and turns. A well written book.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Better than I expected.  Def not kid friendly.  Story line is okay with shoot and blow up scenes throughout movie.  Love watching movies through amazon any where any time.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does not cast (google's word for mirroring) from IOS unless you are using only the netflix or youtube apps. Not even from the Chrome broser APP. From a laptop, you can cast from Chrome. What a useless POS. Went back through promotional material and nowhere were these called out, infact it was all about how you can cast from anywhere and anything. I expect most people will return this.Do no Evil.. yeah right, Google! bloody liars
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and soothing music -you won't hit mute. Just downloaded this game so not too far into it but it looks like if you select right things to grow and be patient you won't need to purchase anything with real money. Definitely a soothing game if you want to de-stress from a crazy day.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|The album to listen to as you drive on I95 through North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia.  Every track is extremely listenable.  'Miss You' from the title implies a couple separated by distance, when that couple is separated in the same bedroom.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|Good movie and glad I could download it instantly. However, would be nice for amazon to allow me to hook up my iPad to the tv and watch the movie on a bigger screen. Their app (which you must download to watch these movies) does not allow that feature.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I already had this app on my Blackberry and it was working very well, but this one is even better!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This is a fun, simple game for anyone in the family.  It is very addictive. Not for the person who wants a real challenge.  Just simple fun.
B00322PKBW|5.0|Great watch. Good price. Looks awesome.  I've always had a swatch since the 80's and the still make a quality product !!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was one story I couldn't stop reading. It kept my attention right up to this chapter. I even shed a tear at the terrible things that Latinas and the people of the district's were put through. What a lesson for everyone to learn. A wonderful series.
B0082Z447U|4.0|This an interesting story with very defined characters. You will certainly know the good guys from the bad guys! The &#34;detective&#34; work is perhaps more involved than is needed, but after all it is meant to be a tale of wrong turns and missed chances. The Fosco character reigns supreme as a more complex villain, and Marion comes across as the 19th Century's &#34;thinking woman&#34; although this perhaps knocks her out of consideration as a love interest. The romance is saved for one of those limp and lovely creatures so popular during this era.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game was fun it was hard to put down. At times it was frustrating.you had to think to figure out the clues.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD TRY THIS APP ITS OK YOU COULD DOWNLOAD PICTURE'S AND SO MUCH MORE YOU COULD ALSO VIEW OTHER THINGS TO.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Just what I needed to make my kindle even more of a valuable tool! it is wonderful to add apps that make a good product even better!
0060763280|4.0|As a veteran sales agent, this was suggested to me by a well respected, and very successful, salesperson who I recently met. It may be only the second such book I have ever read on the subject. Well worth it especially if you are looking for a new slant on sales.
B0098460O4|4.0|We watched Jonathan and Charlotte really grow on the show. Their voices are heavenly together and the songs are very relaxing.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Love your attitude and your music<br /><br />Fourteen more words are needed so you can stop reading this or just waste your time reading my drivel.
B004ZNB12O|5.0|Brings back old memories of a younger age. It's good to reflect on the past and have a perspective on the future. The kids now young adults like the older music like this.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|ENOUGH TO DO 3 - 4 MOTHERBOARD INSTALLATIONS.<br /><br />I THINK IT RAN COOLER, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS I EXPECTED.<br />NOT THE FAULT OF THE CASE, PROBABLY I NEED BETTER AIR FLOW.<br /><br />THE PASTE WAS EXCELLENT.
B000007492|5.0|Brings back old memories of a younger age. It's good to reflect on the past and have a perspective on the future. Rodger Hodson was the best.
B0081336FO|5.0|Just great! Keeps you right there! Interaction with the story and characters a plus! Must be able to look at the intended focus and the background
B00DW36G32|3.0|Good movie that makes you keep watching to the end. Robert De Niro is getting old. Hollywood needs to make some classic gangster/mafia movies with him before he retires for good. John Travolta had a convincing Eastern European accent. GOOD JOB!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Good alarm clock app. Multiple possible alarm times. Multiple alarm &quot;chimes&quot; possible-- the alarm WILL awaken you. Several clock face images available. Useful weather forecast information. Also has a variable-timer &quot;snooze&quot; feature. Can function as a bedside clock (should be plugged in). Five-star (5*), A+++.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I watched it with really low expectations, and it turned out to be a great film.  I would recommend it for everyone.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is a very fun game. I like the little puzzles it has for you to figure out. Keeps you on your toes and keeps your brain busy.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I have this app on all three of my laptops and both of my tablets. I just downloaded the app on my muve music smart-phone and so far so good. If you are a music lover this app is for you.
B00D37UP4S|5.0|I watched the movie first and fell in love!! Watched it a couple more times. Then I decided to read the book and realized the movie wasn't all that. The book was 10x better. They cut so much good parts that made me love that book. The way Jared came to love Wanda even though she took the body of his love. How Kyle learn to except Wanda and found his love, Jodi. Wanda becoming \\"more\\" Human. Jamie and Wanda's GREAT relationship. Her human friends that stood by her in the cave, including the death of 2 of them. Why Wanda decided to die instead of keeping the body or going to another planet. And the Ian and Wanda scene \\"your not leaving me\\" was WAY more emotional in the book and captured the essence of the moment. In the movie I didn't feel Ian's anger the way I imaged and how much they came to love each other. Also when Jamie was sick and Jared and Wanda snuck off to get meds cause no but Jared trusted het. But both were great so I give a five.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I liked the first one and the second did not disappoint. Book number three here I come.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I think this is the best book ever, and trust me,i have read a lot of books. This book has sonething for everyone and its so amazing.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Love the connection of orphans from different time periods having such parallels lives.  Vivian and Molly are so real.  As you read you can see that we have always had a throw away population of children that need he same things as a normal child.  We all know someone who has been in a similar place.  Start reading and I will bet you will not put it down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|HARD TO PUT IT DOWN CAN SAY IT IS ADDICTING  NO DIRECTION AS USUAL  BUT I DID FIGURE IT OUT  HAVE PLAYED MANY MANY GAMES AND HAVE  NOT WON ANY GAMES
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Damn those trains they make me so angry but the game it is fun i took away one star because of the trains they are not funny
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This is a ok book and the next words are just for the minimum amount of words  that you need
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very fun game. Easy to get addicted to. Great way to pass time. I would recommend this to any and everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great running game. I especially like the boss battles. Minions are awesome! Want to be one for Halloween. Minions rock!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Excellent writing and reading.  Couldn't stop reading it<br /><br />I liked the book because it took me quite awhile to put the plot together
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a game of skill. You have to be smart to do this game<br /><br />The best part about this game is that it is free to play it. It one of the best games I have ever played. You have to be smart and skillful to do this game. You have to find and put stuff together to win the game. If you want a hard game this is the game for you.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and couldnt stop reading. The book is so poetic and beautifully written.<br />I cant wait to read the other books
0399255370|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my 29 month old nephew. My brother reads to him and thinks the book<br />is great! He also thinks it may be better when the child is a bit older so while my brother is<br />really enjoying it, he'll keep in on hold for a year or two more for his son.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game, totally addictive and fun.  You can play without Internet also, which is good in car or other travel.  It's a keeper!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Easy and amusing. Always glad to find something to share with kids & grand kids. Looking forward to the next adventure.
B000WC39SG|5.0|Most war movies are anti-war by their very nature and this one is no different. Where this movie excels is by teaching lessons beyond the horrors of war by providing insight into politics, business, logistics, and leadership.
B000YAYIXQ|5.0|Love the old Amy sound, bluesy, jazzy, and retro. So sad she chose a harder life than necessary. Miss her music and her, R.I.P.
0321934318|3.0|This is really 3.5 stars.  I got Lightroom 5 several weeks ago - first Lightroom product; wanted a physical product I could refer to while trying to figure it out. This fits the bill and has indeed helped me learn some of the techniques and tweaks that are possible with the program.  The explanations are clear; the instructions mostly spot on. My problem with it is that there is a LOT of flipping back and forth in the book.  For instance, you can be on (say) page 40 and on step 2 of what Kelby is trying to describe.  He then says, go back to xx page, or go forward to xx page.  And, in the first three or four chapters, this happens every page or so. Fortunately, I have tons of post-it-notes and spent a bit of time writing on them and using them as bookmarks.  But, by chapter 6, I had so many little notes sticking up from the book, it became hard to follow.  All that said, it is an instructional book and if you read it, it could likely make this part of your workflow easier.  Perhaps in his next iteration, Kelby could come up with a way to understand not all of us started with Lightroom 1 or 2 and make some page flipping less needed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Makes you wish to find your own Christian Grey!!! Made me laugh, cry, but most of all.. Yearn to love!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Pretty cool horse game<br />Although I wish the horses were cheaper, it's still fun though.<br />The competition are awesome.e<br /><br />The horse is well animated'
B0089LOG02|5.0|I have never read about the orphans from New York being taken by train to new families before and this book gives such a powerful , emotional account of what these children endured and survived, that it made me cry. The 74 year age gap between the two main characters is wonderful and just proves how life from century to century doesn't change human behaviour or emotions. Amazing novel which is beautifully written.
1574214276|5.0|I recommend this to anyone just learning to Tangle.  Follow it day by day and you'll soon find yourself creating beautiful works of art.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Firstly all the ads say it cost $35.00, but I had to pay $70.00 at amazon.  What we realized later is that when they first came out some people bought a whole bunch so that they then could sell them at their price.  Too bad I didn't realize this sooner.  I would never have gotten it.<br /><br /> Especially since we also found that it doesn't do what the ads say it does.  It only works with you tube and net flix that you have to pay for.<br /><br />We were also disappointed in the fact that you have to bring your Reuter close to the tv.  That could be an inconvenience for some, like us.<br /><br />Another thing it does not work with iPads although It works with an one of our iPhones and our laptop.<br /><br />After the initial novelty of it, we haven't used it and probably  won't.  Probably will put back the Reuter back in its rightful place and the chromecast back in the box it came in.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Hi there, I just want to say, great game. But 1 problem. I can't pass level nine! Please CHANGE the stupid assy TARGET TIME for level nine to 4:36.00 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
B0063GORYU|5.0|One of the best versions of solitaire ive played. Great app to play while your waiting. I play as often as I can.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was  best book I ever read and I like to read it again and please make more book Jeff
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Fast paced and well done movie. Great acting and unpredictable plot that keeps you guessing throughout. Every time you think you have it figured out another twist comes
B000PMG16U|5.0|All three movies are Blu Ray Quality.  I'm not going to review the movies because if you haven't seen them...Fast delivery and the movies look and sound awesome.  Definitely worth the money to upgrade to blu ray over DVD.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I love the game! Please try it you'll it! Good card game for friend and family to play you can invite only to play.
