B009AMALGM|5.0|i think it was great very good peole get this if you have 1-3 because it is very good to me at least
B009YU6FJM|5.0|just fantastic from start to finish. best since white pony changed their style. although every album is great Deftones are one of the only band who get better with age.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Excellent price on classic story. Voices are on target with characters. Inexpensive gift for a child. I bought this one for my granddaughter.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun for kids and adults.  The entire family enjoys this game. Too bad the additional horses are so pricey!  Nonetheless a great game.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|Plot moves swiftly and keeps me interested by introducing technology in the story that does exist but I didn't know about it!
B008JFUUIA|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this movie a five star rating is due to some unneeded language. Great singing!!! Even my husband loved it, we will watch it again and again.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|First encounter with Facebook.  Easy to use, easy to retrieve, fun to see all the stuff people post and consider it a &#34;something&#34; to play with....
B004GYY714|3.0|I used it for awhile, but I like Pandora better. What can i say? Sorry tuneln, we had some good times...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game really is the best game on the market! And,it's free! I love it! Great graphics,good challenges and missions,and it doesn't cost real money to get farther in the game. I think it's way better than temple run. It's great!!
0920668372|5.0|I could not endorse a book more ....it is a true love story of mom to her child which inevitably carries on to her now adult child to his little one. LOVE YOU FOREVER is a VERY HEARTFELT BOOK written with such emotion that it brings one to tears,it does me every time i read it. I read it to my son,who is now a father himself ,who reads it to his infant child.It is a book that carries on through generations ,a TRUE LOVE STORY !!! EVERY PARENT Should have a copy of it !!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is great, but the &quot;Save me&quot; feature has a bug. Sometimes when I try to use it, it crashes the game, and when I run the app again, I have -1 Gems. I'd rate it 5 stars if the glitch was fixed.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I wish they were up front about having to buy the full version,  I would gladly have paid for the full version straight off.  Otherwise, this game is pure fun.  The storyline is superb and the puzzles kept me on my feet.  I don't know if all games come with the option to pick easy level or hard level,  but I appreciate the options.  I recommend this for anyone who likes puzzle games.
B00A757EFW|4.0|nostalgic and a lot of fun!! fUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN FUN A lot of entertainment! fun fun fun.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its a pretty good game that pretty much fits the description. I like competing and caring for my realistic-ish horse
B006C1DH92|5.0|I have been enjoying Fruit Ninja for several months so tried this version & I love it! There is much more variety in the games & the music & commentary are great fun. So glad that I finally tried it!<br /><br />I am not a gamer but I am totally enjoying these games & have recomended them to my friends -- who are 55+ years old like me!
B0097PW7H8|5.0|This is a life saver.  I get extra juice out of my cell phone battery.  Since my husband and I use our cell phones as our &#34;house&#34; phones, it is important to have them running all the time.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is loads of fun I have to force myself to stop playing so that I can get dinner on the table.
B007FC3AAI|4.0|I've seen it a lot of times.  As a filmmaker, it's a little slow but enjoyable. I definitely wanted my own copy.
B000H7JCIW|5.0|Play this one over and over. She's slim,energetic,powerful ! Love the dancing divas, the backdrop of Radio City and the choice of music.
B004TI5N38|5.0|It was a Baldacci, a very good read read read read read read read read read read read read read
B008APX4P0|5.0|While looking for a monitor for hobby photo editing on a Mac Mini I found this informative article on the features of high quality monitors: [...] (or search for \\"high quality monitors ImageScience\\"). The Eizo Foris FS2333W monitor was recommended in the under $500 category.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|First let me say I'm not your typical Tegan and Sara fan.  I'm an old 48 year old guy who worshiped Kiss and Bruce Springsteen growing up and still do.  My daughter who is an amazing musician in her own right told me about them.  She is also a gay teen and I was very impressed how T&S were such a postive influence in her life so I took a listen.<br /><br />I have to say I was instantly hooked.  My first introduction was the song \\"Where Does the Good Go\\" and then ran to Barnes & Nobel and bought the Con.  I was so impressed how poetic their lyrics were and played that CD endlessly in my car.  My daughter and her girlfriend thought it was so cute how I became such a big fan.<br /><br />When Sainthood came out, I rushed to buy it and noticed how different it was from the Con.  However, I liked it just as much and realized how versatile T&S was.<br /><br />So here comes Heartthrob in all its glory and I instantly had flashbacks of Tiger Beat magazine when I saw the CD cover. I had a strong feeling these amazing artists were flexing their artistic muscles once again.<br /><br />What the Con was to teenage angst and finding oneself through trials and tribulations, Heartthrob feels more like falling in love and falling out of love but without the self examination and more of the emotional surface feelings that come with strong crushes and new found love.  Although my nature is to be a little OCD, I know I am going to be obsessed with this album.  The music is fun, catchy and intelligent.  In one sentence I would say Tegan and Sara go mainstream and still seem cool and intelligent.<br /><br />To all their old fans who feel this album is not being true to the emotional dark side and the indie spirit of Tegan and Sara, please give this one a chance, they have been at this game for more than a decade, so it is about time we start hearing them on the radio and this album has the potential for that.  It has so much more depth than many might first realize.  As a musician myself, I can instantly hear how their chops have been flexed and how their artistry has grown.<br /><br />I have a feeling the mainstream music world and critics alike are going to stand up and say Damn, \\"what an amazing album\\".<br /><br />Great Job Ladies!!  Your 13 year career is going to last another 30 or 40 years or as long as you keep gracing us with such wonderful music.I can instantly hear how their chops have been flexed and how their artistry has grown.<br /><br />I have a feeling the mainstream music world and critics alike are going to stand up and say Damn, \\"what an amazing album\\".<br /><br />Great Job Ladies!!

B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's free, it's a good translation, it's easily navigated and it's on a Kindle, what more can you ask for?
B00B19DMUE|1.0|That should be a warning to not buy this movie or even rent it. In fact, don't waste your time even if you can see if for free.<br /><br />Husband is separated from wife. Husband gets weekend with children where the younger daughter spots a box her daddy buys for her at a yard sale. There is an ominous warning from a bandaged person in the window beyond who watches the purchase. The girl figures a way to open the box, and soon there is a voice that starts talking to the girl, who in turn, starts acting strangely. Daddy doesn't understand and mommy thinks daddy is abusing their little girl. In desperation, daddy takes the box, which incidentally had Hebraic writing carved in it, and takes it to the Hassidim Community in Brooklyn for answers and solutions.<br /><br />Taking it into a temple, the other religious men in their shtreimel and rekels gasp and step back as if Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who is daddy, has just released the Bubonic Plague. The grand rebbi says he cannot help him. He pronounces it an evil box used to constrain some evil spirit that was evil in humanhood, and it will kill his daughter. But the son waiting outside says it is his obligation as a Jew to help, and the two drive back upstate to get the evil spirit that is taking over daddy's little girl. A Jewish exorcism begins.<br /><br />With daughter sounding odd, rolling eyeballs, levitating, snd smacking mom and dad around a room in the basement of a hospital where the lights go on and off like some kind of light show at Studio 54, our Hassidic hero in shawl and yalmulka is bowing repeatedly saying some kind of exorcism ritual to take that evil soul out of the man's daughter. Ahhh-beeeee-zoooo, he yells continually.<br /><br />The Possession might possess you in an evil sort of way. It might make you want to put this director and script writer into a little box--for eternity. If you buy it or watch if after reading this, you can only ask yourself whatever possessed you to do it?<br /><br />Ahhhhh-beeeee-zooooo! A-beeee-zoooooo!ee-zooooo! A-beeee-zoooooo!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Oh yes! I have read all of the Jack Reacher novels at least once. I am crazy about Jack Reacher! I love the action, I love the man. Never have I been disappointed. Lee Child has created a character that really does please me. This book was no exception to the &#34;Jack Reacher rules&#34; rule! A great read!
0743270754|4.0|Good, informative book.<br /><br />However, all of the praise we heap upon Lincoln would not exist if not for Grant. Lincoln passively accepted poor general after poor general until the country was practically bled white.<br /><br />Only with the entrance of Grant (and Sherman), and their hard bitten, stern methods on the battlefield (winning) did Lincoln come around the glory he has today.<br /><br />If not for Grant, willing to kill as many as it takes (regardless of losses), Lincoln would be viewed today as a total failure.<br /><br />Don't take my word for it, read the book.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|It had been a while since I read anything by Stephen King, but the title of this book really caught my attention. I found it to be a fascinating idea and I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent reading the book. It was better than a lot of King's books, it had a different feel to it. I would recommend it as a very good read. I very well remember 11/22/63 and the sadness associated with that particular date. The &#34;what if's&#34; were all very interesting.
B0075MFS9Y|2.0|I was really excited about this record, based on the song I had heard on the radio. Unfortunately, the rest of the album was nothing like what I expected, it was boring, dull, repetitive and a downer.Not a good listen at all. Nobody in the house liked it at all.
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|Just found Castle through re-runs and now I'm hooked. Had to catch up from the beginning. This show is great. The characters are so real world especially their facial expressions.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|And he did not appear in this movie. Obviously the people lauding this film as being so great are the ones that think McDonald's is haute cuisine. The producers of this movie really should have thought more out-of-the-box. The whole thing was just bad.
B00992CF6W|5.0|As a fan of minecraft since I got it around 1.2.5 on the Pc, this app was a no brainer for me. I will always love that feeling when you finish that awesome house, or come out of the earth carrying more resources then you know what to do with. Amazing adaptation of minecraft onto the mobile platform. I don't have xbox (ps3 forever!!!) but I play this on the computer edition and its amazing. In my opinion, Minecraft is the best game ever created for creative people like me. I like how they have added new content that differs from the Pc edition's alpha days. PLZ ADD CAVES! Besides building, caving has always been my favorite thing in minecraft. Well, see yah! Peace! And happy mining!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love this book, Over half way through, its a real page turner, and Wow what a shock! Cant wait to finish reading it and discuss at book club!
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Not a book for a conservative soul. Very descriptive, extremely entertaining book. Once I got through the first book, I couldn't help but to read the second and then the third!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Very addicting story. It was like a movie playing in my head as I read it. Each chapter gets deeper. Definitely looking forward to reading the other trilogies!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it as much as I loved the first two. Again, you either love it or hate it. It's very intriguing! Must Read!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Another Stephen King book that I couldn't put down.  I could go on and on explaining what made it such a good book, but why bother.  It's a Stephen King book.  That says it all!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|What a truly compelling book! I had the WHOLE trilogy read in 14 days, all three books! you either love it or hate it. Simply COULD NOT put it down!
B00008PX8P|5.0|would recommend to anyone. the is for anyone that love led zeppelin. luv it<br />could be used for history of led zeppelin fans
B007J4T2G8|5.0|After the first 10 pages you will either have the whole trilogy read in a week, or never want to open it again. I found it IMPOSSIBLE to tear my eyes away from it. LITERALLY!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|you know a game is good when your in the top 2% on the the all time leader boards, like me... if your looking for hours of fun and need time to waste, get this game, I have no idea what there going to do for temple run 3
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome Book! So Compelling. Hard to put down. Every other page it seemed took a new and unexpected turn. So much fun to read!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This cd is great to listen to as it has a great variety of songs.  Taylor Swift is just great!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a great app you should get is i play it all day long  i love love love it
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book, told through life in the dogs eyes.  Make sure you have kleenex handy, it is sure to bring tears.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the game and graphics. Very fun to play. Great for all ages. Can't wait for a third. The monkey is bigger than ever!
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST GAME IN THE WORLD accept that the updates come later than they do on i pod it is so annoying but still THE BEST GAME
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Still reading it will let you know when I finish it...but so far I am enjoying it and getting alot out of it
B00555X8OA|5.0|This book is full of interesting psychology studies. It's an easy read, has lots of interesting ideas about how the brain works, and will be great dinner conversation fodder.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I decided to read the book before seeing the movie as I had heard mixed reviews about the film.  I enjoyed it, it was entertaining.  I still have not seen the movie but plan to in the not too distant future
0545265355|5.0|The books are great, and they box set arrived on time. It is exactly what the description said they would be, so it was accurately explained.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I wish they had this on blu ray. I absolutely LOVE the show. When it aired I watched every episode at least twice-- and laughed hard each time! Zooey Deschanel is lovely as always and the character Schmidt is so original and extremely funny. Two thumbs up!
B00B2166BS|5.0|I was a little skepitcal when i saw this on amazon, because its not currently being sold by other outlets. However I have had it now for 4 days and I can say this thing is great! Faster charging, great magnetic break-away feature, and it doesn't take up your micro usb slot. If you own a nexus 10 this is a must buy
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Although I'm a little tired of the young ladies guilt the book is great continuation I didn't expect what was coming
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game it looks so real and fun and I am so glad I download its amazing g and i
1451695195|1.0|This Neurosurgeon is surprisingly unscientific in his account - he may be writing for laymen but, as a layperson with a strong interest in neurophysiology and having studied it myself, I could tell there was no 'proof' about his personal experience more aligned with a psychedelic trip than a visit to Heaven.  He has obviously wanted to believe in God all his life but never been able to - this, along with his skydiving experiences gave his brain a perfect motivation to come up with a comforting fantasy while he was in coma.  There is no proof his neocortex was not functioning - certainly none has been given in the book - no reports, no fMRI, just his word for it (and a doctor he probably works with anyway).  I would love to know where the millions of dollars of profit from this book are going - charity?  Research into brain injury?  Churches?  A jolly pleasant life for this man?  No mention was made of how his biological sister, Betsy, passed away - why?  How could Heaven be so different to that described in the Bible?  I have no faith in this being an account of Heaven - none at all.  In the Appendices, he cites nine alternative reasons for his experience, based on other neurologists' theories - they all sound plausible to me, some more than others - but he discounts every one by just saying they don't adequately describe the detail of his experience (trip).  I want to follow up and see how much profit was made from the book and exactly what it being done with it.  VERY sceptical indeed.
0375842209|2.0|My daughter and I started reading this together and just couldn't get into it, we didn't like it at all.
B00062PN6I|5.0|Nice build and surprisingly good sound for $10 headphones.  If you're used to high end equipment and picky about your audio gear, these probably aren't for you.  You wouldn't be looking for $10 headphones to begin with.  If you're looking for cheap headphones with good sound, you really can't go wrong with these.  I sometimes find the square edges of digital music irritating, especially at the top end.  So while some may find the sound through these to be slightly muffled, I find it warm and comfortable.  Of course it's all subjective.  At this price...I love them.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book because it brings together Greek history and real life situations. I've always loved Greek history and reading this brings back memories of hearing all of the stories for the first time.
B00015YVD6|4.0|This movie is one of my favorites, I even watched it when I was little. It's funny and romantic at the same time!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This may not be great literature, but it's so fun to read and I could not put it down. I always had to know what comes next.<br />And for me, books that I cannot put down are the best!<br />It's a great impossible love story and I like the two main characters - crazy as they are...<br />(And as for the sex scenes, they are kinda hot...)<br /><br />The first book was better in my opinion, but this doesn't fall much far behind.<br /><br />If you're into a good, impossible love story and easy reading that you will not be able to put down - this trilogy is for you.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book, I couldn't put it down and finished it in less than a week. Nicholas Sparks knows how to make the novel, romantic and suspenseful all in one. I LOVED<br />it , I cried, laughed, and was just shocked. I suggest you read this book.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Loved this movie as a kid and purchased it as a Christmas gift for a great price.  The 10-year-old, who received it, thoroughly enjoyed the movie.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This little case fits great and gives me great protection and is simple and well made, GOOD JOB. It lives up to the video piece in the ad.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|When I started to read the first book I was sceptical at first because it was constantly being compared to fifty shades of grey. But when I read it I fell in love with Gideon as I fell in love with Christian. What I truly like about this series is that Sylvia Day didn't try to replicate fifty shades I believe she used it as inspiration. Waiting five months for the next book is going to be torture but it'll be worth it!
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I love it, there are some videos already seen the first DVD, but the other videos are spectacular.<br />Good opportunity to gain a DVD with wonderful videos
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot. Good time waster. Ok, now stop bothering me for reviews! LA LA LA la
B001NZEHMS|5.0|If your from the 80's you know why.  it is one of the best albums to define a generation and obviously launched a new style in music.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was totally boring to me. I think the reason I found it so dull was because there was no character included in which I felt any empathy.. I really didn't care if any of his characters met an awful fate.  Not one of them had the least bit of human kindness or appeal.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I think this book is better than the Harry potter series  and the invention of hugo cabaret and the Harry Truman
B002LFPAUC|5.0|We loved it when it aired years ago so much that we ordered the set. We enjoy watching Fawlty Towers over and over. Silly but lovable. Wish it had run longer when it was on BBC.
B000O77SRC|5.0|I looked everywhere for this movie and finally found it on amazon and I'm so happy I found it. My husband and I love this movie and finally decided to buy it for ourselves. The movie never gets old, always a thriller.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I never really was a devotee of the show when it was on the air, but my husband was and by the time I started watching it I'd missed a lot of the history of the group's dynamics. Now that we have the series we are really enjoying watching it in order and have laughed out loud so much that it is like therapy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun! love this app! this game is fun for me and both my daughters ....it keeps them entertained for hours!
0312330537|5.0|We were urged to read this book by several friends who swore, although it is a huge book, we would not be able to put it down once started. They were so right. My husband and I each got it and read it at the same time; enjoyed sharing about it because it is an emotional roller-coaster ride as well as a fabulous story with a bit of factual historic element. Although fiction, based on fact, we felt we were right there experiencing everything Shantaram did. I've never had a desire to go to India but after reading this book I have a renewed perspective on India and her people. We have bought this book for several friends and we've recommended it countless times. It is way up in our top 10.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Even better watching it for the second time! This time in the comfort of my own home, in my own recliner!
B001EBV0NU|5.0|It is not a serious  movie, it  is jut plain fun and entertaining.  These actors must have had a blast making this movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun game. This game keeps me happy and busy. It makes me feel like I have a real horse.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|sooo much better than temple run 1it is really good it is great great great  great it is so so good!
B001K3KK0Q|4.0|I know a re-make is coming out soon with Leonardo Decaprio and I wanted to watch this one again to refresh<br />my memory... so I'd have something to compare it to.. I wasn't disappointed! Love Robert Redford, it's going to be hard to<br />see someone else in the role of J. Gatsby....
B00B780TAK|5.0|I understand that this is over, but really? How can they after that series finale? This show has been the best entertainment in television that I have seen in so long. It breaks my heart to think they are all gone now. I have so looked forward to each episode; more than any other show on television.<br /><br />I am in mourning.....
B0043WDK2G|5.0|Never had time to watch from the beginning, everyone was always telling me that<br />I was missing a great TV show and that I'd love it....I'm on the 3rd Season and<br />love all the characters and story lines... Love the relationship between Castle<br />and Beckett!!  Can't wait to get caught up, so I can watch on Monday nights!!
B00A2H9L2E|3.0|First off. what a movie. I agree with everyone saying that if you havent seen the first, you will be lost completely but thats with a lot of sequals. This movie is something built for the fans. It brought out alot of references (SPOILER) like the red shoe on the dresser an item used in the third game, the hotel room that they saty in, same as in the game, plus the locations in the movie went throught pretty much the same order as in the game. but it added alot of stuff that should have never been in it like pyramid head, american scares like pop ups, alot of gore, dumb f***in 3D and a scary kid mostly used in japanese horror films. It was a movie that had alot of potentail to have the right to be called silent hill but lost it all completely. This is why I give a 3 out of 5, it was ok but could be better.
B003B02O7I|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Really hard to put down cause you just want to know what happens next. I am a huge John Grisham fan and this book just made me an even bigger fan. Thoroughly pleased.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Its just a little quirky but I loved it! You will notice that a lot of stars got their beginnings in this series!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Johnny Depp makes this movie the same as he does in most of the movies he has played in lately
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Best book I have read in a while! Could not put it down! The possibility of a zombie apocalypse has never seemed so believable.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I love all the actors going in and I was hooked from the trailer in movie theaters. A bit disappointed that more folks didn't jump on the bandwagon once it was released but I was so not disappointed. This is a GREAT movie! Good story, wonderful locations, and really nice actors to watch and have working in an industry that does not always include their demographic! Thanks for reading!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Moved very slowly, but once it got going was very engrossing. Some aspects were confusing but eventually it all came together. I was very satisfied with the ending.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I quit reading this book 3 times.  Her  pages of intimate description became so tedious.  But I am glad I fiinished.  If the reader can hang on long enough, the plot is worth it.
B00B2166BS|4.0|Shipping was good, ordered Sat morning, received Wed by mail.<br /><br />At first the plug wouldn't attach to the tablet, the magnets felt too weak. Then I saw that the magnets weren't in line with each other, like the plug was twisted in two dimensions. I really didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it and waiting on a replacement so I gave it a gentle twist to put the magnets in line with each other, and it worked!<br /><br />The plug now connects properly and charging seems a bit faster than with the micro-USB plug.<br /><br />Remember that this is only a charging cord, it doesn't include the actual charger, and the cable is only 4 ft long. For $20 it should include the charger and the cable should be 1 or 2 feet longer, but this is the first (and so far only) such cable available. If you want to wait for more choices in the market the price will drop, and maybe the selection will improve.
B0009P5YXO|3.0|So, truthfully, I expected something at this price point to be a little sturdier. It's very cheap plastic, and the extendable part just slides in and out with gravity. My husband bought this for me for my grad school graduation. I didn't want to tell him, but I'm a little disappointed in the quality, frankly. Having said that, my 7-year-old loves it, and if I don't keep it hidden, he's off with it.<br /><br />This is a ten-dollar toy. If you find it for ten dollars, you are golden.
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I really enjoy this app, but I do have a couple suggestions. One, that I have seen some others mention, is the loop of the sound clips. Most of them are pretty good, but I find the thunderstorm to be a bit repetitive.<br /><br />The only other thing I wish is the ability to record and mix sounds, which only seems capable on the iPhone<br />Overall, a great app. I would even consider paying for it (I happened to get it for free in the appstore).
B0038QGXHW|5.0|This is another of Jarrett's masterpieces and every track is a stunning interpretation of what I love about his music.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great effects! good story line. wish there was more.  I was disappointed when I finished the game. Would have liked it to be longer.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Not much to say other than these 'card' type storage devices are very well made, I feel confident I can carry this in my wallet without fear of bending or breaking my case. You can hear a definite 'click' when inserting my SD cards into the open available slots, so no fear of losing your cards by accidental falling out. Plenty of room to write down the size and data on the media. My only CON is; be careful after writing on the outside, best to let it sit for at least a few hours for the (Sharpie to dry) or you will have a smeary mess. My marker (Sharpie) didn't dry as fast as I thought. I have two of these and both look quite messy as I explained earlier, but work fine. Once you smear the outside paper you will never get it clean again. So the CON in fact is human error and can be avoided. I wish I knew this before they arrived at my house. I would have 'marked' them and let them sit for a day before using them.
B0090X4HES|4.0|Great rookie album for Kendrick. Im sure he will come with a lot of heat for years and years to come
B000JMKNZQ|5.0|Love this author.  He engages your heart, mind and soul. So many things that cause introspection and growth if you allow yourself the opportunity
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I chose to read this book because I went to a friend's house, and she had the book so I read the back and book jacket. When I got home I read some reviews that amazed me. Ten dollars well spent!!<br /><br />  I gave the book a 5star. I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good surprise or two, and who loves anything to do with kids that are different like the character Auggie. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.
B0094OLJD0|5.0|No complaints about this album.  A great match-up between these two - natural chemistry and talent gives this a unique and utterly enjoyable sound.
1442444053|5.0|Sometimes when you get a hardcover book of a classic, you keep your expectations in check just in case it really isn't as good as it appears to be.  This one is.  I am impressed with this book.  While I read the story years ago, in a small mass market paperback book, I really wanted to read it again.  This time though, I wanted a good quality copy hardback edition for reading again and again and this is perfect! I would recommend getting this edition if your thinking about it, either reading it again years after reading it the first time, or reading it for the first time.  Its a treat to me to be able to read such a fine quality story in a fine quality edition. Excellent quality.
B0067TQQI8|3.0|This product, like all Anker products I've used offers great value combined with a quality product. I take issue in this case with not only the description for this Amazon item, but the wording on the packaging. The box has the feel of a quality product of course; thick cardboard, raised lettering, foil embossed highlights, sticker-sealed and well laid out. But nowhere in the description here (as of 01-31-13) nor on the box is the auto shut-off feature listed.<br /><br />I have the previous version of the Astro2, and I also have the bigger 10,000mah external battery which has an 'auto shut-off' feature. For what I use that pack for that's OK (it was also listed in the features so I wasn't surprised). However if I plug a device into this new Astro2 unit and leave it overnight (as I sometimes do) it will not be fully charged in the morning like with the older design. Once it hits full charge, it shuts off and does not turn back on when the device calls for it and instead drains. Also, with the previous design the blue indicators stayed on, with this they shut off and there is no way to visually verify the device is on. They changed the way the LED light works too, however it was better previously imo. The button was on the side and needed to be pressed twice fast to activate. Now the button is on top (it is at least set in a bit which is good) and needs to be pressed and held to turn on, but it's actually more likely to get turned on in my bag with this layout. I was hoping to get a second one so I can swap them out and always have one charged and ready. It looks like since Anker no longer brands their own Astro2 (original design) I'll have to go with the PowerGen version to replace this. Also it's not a deal breaker but what's the obsession with glossy plastic? I would much prefer something with a more matte finish so scratches and fingerprints are better obscured.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Everything about this series is done so well, the acting, the costumes, the story.....I can't stop watching. I can't wait for the next episode!
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another excellent thriller from Vince Flynn.  I have read all of his Mitch Rapp line up and this ranks on par with the rest.  The action is packed in this book and the suspense, while it may be predictable, is still compelling.  I can not wait for the next one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|i've only watched one episode so far & really enjoyed it blah blah blah blah a a a a a
B0063IH60K|3.0|This traditional card game has very realistic qualities but annoying and obtrusive advertisements. A full page advertisement must be dispersed before every game. This advertisement is in addition to the ad which will display for Kindle Fire HD users every time the device is used.  The game itself is well executed and quite fun. Ability to add multiple decks, change the card background and have shuffling sound effects adds to the realism of the game.  The free price is great but the pervasive full page ads are an annoyance.  I do not see a paid version of this game in the app store that would eliminate the ads. All in all, a worthwhile download but the forced advertising, limited apps (including more game choices) and inability to install Android apps (including a strong ad free solitaire game) outside the Amazon app store (unless one performs a warranty killing device root) combine to greatly diminish the Kindle usability experience. As well executed as this game is, it is also a reminder of the commercialism which is forced onto Kindle tablet users.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|abyss is great.  It has a good story line and the graphics are phenomenal.  The puzzle are great and works the brain.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've always tried to read the Bible all the way through, but so often I'd have a little time waiting for an appointment or my kids and not have my Bible with me.  Now, with my tablet in my purse and the Bible and reading plan on my tablet, I'm making good progress!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Moneyball is 2011's best film, after [[ASIN:B0094K1NYE Hugo]].<br />Rather than conform to the usual cliches that plague modern sports films, Moneyball is well-acted, smart, funny, sharp, and informative. It will almost certainly capture your interest, even if you aren't a baseball fan.<br /><br />The cast is very strong, with Brad Pitt giving an exceptionally great, Oscar-nominated performance as out-of-the-box thinking baseball manager Billy Beane. I really couldn't take my eyes off him - it's definitely in the top 5 five performances in his illustrious career.<br />Critics also praise his performance saying: \\"Pitt is mesmerizing - he's high-strung and laid-back all at once. It's an Oscar-worthy performance\\", and, \\"Pitt is terrific as the film's complex, driven protagonist.\\"<br /><br />In the supporting cast Phillip Seymour Hoffman (Reuniting with director Bennett Miller after Capote) and Robin Wright (The Princess Bride) act as Art Howe and Casey Beane. Hoffman and Wright's performances are typically good and are generally beyond criticism, but the biggest surprise of the film is Jonah Hill, who plays a number-crunching Harvard graduate. Hill usually acts in comedies such as 21 Jump Street and Superbad, but after 2011 he has taken to more dramatic roles with Moneyball and Scorsese's upcoming The Wolf of Wall Street. He absolutely will blow you away in this film with his performance of surprising depth.<br /><br />Equally surprising is how Moneyball appeals to both baseball fans and NON-baseball fans alike. I fall into the latter category, but I was just as riveted (and just as able to follow the baseball-related plot) as any fan of baseball.<br />Director Bennett Miller has achieved something quite extraordinary!<br /><br />And although at it's core Moneyball IS a sports underdog story, it's one that's unpredictable and entertaining, not suffering from the usual cliched plot devices. Miller and screenwriters Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin have also woven in some fine human drama and sharp humour into the mix. It works effectively.<br /><br />In conclusion, Moneyball is one of 2011's best films - an exceptionally well written, well acted, well filmed, well directed, informative, easy to watch, funny, dramatic baseball story, but one that concentrates more on the logistics of the game rather than the people who play it. It features a breakout role by Jonah Hill, and a damn good performance by Brad Pitt. This is must-watching for baseball fans and non baseball fans alike.<br /><br />4.5 Stars! Strongest recommendation!fine human drama and sharp humour into the mix.

0670026603|5.0|This book was difficult to put down.  It hooked me and kept me hanging.  The story is a bit like a rose unfolding or peeling back the layers of an onion.  It keeps exposing and bringing to the surface experiences, emotion, growth and life.<br /><br />Louisa Clark meets the handsome Will Traynor under the worst of circumstances.  At the time she meets Will he had been confined to a wheel chair as the result of a life changing accident which severed his spinal cord at the C5-6 vetebrae.  Louisa is hired to be his companion on a six month contract.<br /><br />Will is difficult.  However, eventually Louisa's manner slowly begins to thaw Will's horrible temperment. Will and Louisa seem to be making progress towards a comfortable companionship until the day Will's sister Georgina arrives.  Louisa overhears Will's mother Camilla and Georgina discussing the agreement Will has made with his parents to give them six months before he undertakes to take his life in an assisted suicide in Switzerland.  Upon hearing this, Louisa with the permission of Will's family, embarks upon a mission to show Will that there is still much in life for him to enjoy, even though his life has dramatically changed and is not the life he had always envisioned leading.<br /><br />Over time, Will and Louisa fall in love.  But, is this enough to deter Will from his prearranged destiny.<br /><br />I can't destroy the ending by telling anyone who may chance to read this book.  However, I will confess I found it difficult to put down and was cheering Louisa and Will on, hoping that they would find a lifetime of forevers and adventures together.  You will have to read this story of compassion, will and adventure to learn what occurs.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is fun but it takes a long time to get gems.  The graphics are very lifelike and well done.
0060566108|4.0|I gave these books as a Christmas gift - The person that I gave them to reports that the books are very informative and helpful.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This Nicholas Sparks book was an easy read, fast plot, nothing unexpected in the story.  Reminded me of a &#34;Lifetime&#34; TV movie.  Probably a good rainy day or beach type book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a very good book and was funny and I laughed my butt off so u should buy it now
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got 0.6.0 on my iPad and it was awesome. I can't wait till it comes out on android. Please come out with 0.6.0 also there is a game called pocket inventory you should get that to

1616550414|5.0|This book contains so much information and art from throughout the Zelda chronology, and it's quite an incredible sight. This book is incredibly informative when it comes to Zelda info and trivia, and contains some great interviews with the people behind the series. All-in-all, this is more than worth the price, and a must have for any Zelda fan.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I borrowed the DVD for my friend and after I finished watching I knew it was one that I had to add to my collection with the star-studded cast like Joe DiMaggio, Jason Ekles, Neil Patrick Harris and whoever plays principal Lewis from American dad this is a great film with a great storyline and great acting. Amazon got Me a great Blu-ray in great condition for a great price!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Sooooooo amazeballs! I loved every second of this book. Travis and Abby took me on a roller coaster that I never wanted to end. This wasn't just some cheesy smeesy romance novel, it was the real deal. From the arguments to the kisses. I need more, now!!!!!!!!!!
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Its very nice and handy but the division s inside are a bit too small for my equipment....  its still a nice back pack.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Moving account of what our brave men go through and the terrific sacrifices of their lives for a nation that is sadly forgetting about them when they need us the most. Wake up America and do what is right.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|best obstacle game i ever played its hard when it gets fast but it's fun only thing I didn't like was the prices
B008YCMM2A|4.0|If you're reading this, I don't need to tell you about the music. But like 'The Bootleg Series Vol. 1', this Vol. 2 has to have the worst packaging ever for a release of this stature.<br />One of the reasons 'we' still buy physical product, CDs, DVDs, etc., is for the pleasure of first-rate packaging. This is flimsy, has excess glue, a crappy 'poster', and overall, just a poor design.<br />Let's hope that Vol. 3 gets the packaging it deserves.
0770435726|4.0|I was watching Bob Schieffer on CBS News' Face the Nation, and as his guests he had four authors who had written books that he had recently enjoyed. One of them was Chris Pavone, who had written a spy thriller, The Expats.<br /><br />Pavone said that his inspiration came when his family moved to Europe for his wife's job and he became a full-time dad. I had heard of the book, but Shieffer's enthusiasm and Pavone's description convinced me to put it on my TBR list.<br /><br />Kate Moore is a CIA agent married to Dexter, a nerdy computer geek who works in banking security. Kate worked in the field for the CIA and we discover that she is more than an analyst; she was field agent who killed people. Her husband knows nothing of this, and thinks she writes position papers for the government.<br /><br />So when Dexter comes home and tells Kate that he has a fantastic opportunity in Luxembourg. Kate quits her job, (no easy task) and off they go with their two young sons in tow. Kate makes friends with other expats, and she and Dexter become close friends with Julia and Bill.<br /><br />Kate begins to become suspicious of the couple. Is it because she worked for the CIA that she harbors the idea that Julia and Bill are perhaps assassins? She contacts someone she knew in the CIA and puts her spy skills to the test to find out what is going on.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Dexter is working longer hours and spending little time with the family. Their marriage is strained and soon Kate is snooping on her husband wondering what he is doing. Is he cheating on her? Is he involved in something illegal?<br /><br />Pavone expertly unravels his story slowly, going between the present day in Paris and their time in Luxembourg, yet the story feels so fast-paced. This is a story that you will zip through to find out what is going on, yet at the same time you want to savor the writing and the relationship between Kate and Dexter.<br /><br />I enjoyed being dropped into Luxembourg, watching Katefind her way becoming a full-time mom. Pavone brilliantly compares marriage to the spy game, intimating that people in a marriage may not really know their spouse as well as they think they do. I guarantee you that after reading this terrific novel, you will look a little closer at your spouse.<br /><br />There is a nail-biting action and interaction between Kate and Julia, and between Kate and Dexter. As the story reaches it's crazy climax, I found I had to slow down reading in order to understand exactly what the heck was going on. There are double-and-triple crosses, tables become turned again and again and at the end, I'm still not completely sure what the heck happened.<br /><br />This is a book that will appeal to John Grisham fans, although I like this better than I like most Grisham novels. Pavone combines heart-pounding action with fascinating characters, and I read it in two sittings. This is a very cinematic book, I'd love to see it onscreen, and I hope to read more of Kate's future adventures.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not my usual reading material but I will definitively finish the trilogy. The author does and excellent job putting you in the story without dragging it out with too much useless information. Not for anyone who doesn't have an open mind.
0061692042|1.0|Well-written in terms of plot, character development and dialog. But why am I reading this? Who cares? Not a worthwhile investment in my recreational reading time.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Nice Clock and free! Nice graphics ,options, and features. Will reccomend this app to anyone. Glad I found this one!
0547848412|5.0|Apart from the famous tale, this book is food for thought on the meaning of religions, faith, and survival. A classic that will live beyond our lifetimes.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a great game and the updates are cool. The game is amazing especially because there is always a new character for each update. This game is so fun you will not regret buying it even though it is free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very addictive and fun, if you really like horses this is your game! I like to play it all the time and buying new horses is even better.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it's ok...pretty addicting too.i wish the regenerating ytime offline was lower though because i might want to go do something else besides leaving the game on....i mean i want to go play other apps. but i guess it's a good way to get people to buy coins.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Quick moving story.  Enjoyed it and now know what the grandkids are talking about!<br />Looking forward to reading the sequel.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read the reviews on this book, and they all seemed generally pleased with it. I don't recall reading that it is an entirely consuming page turner. Which means I fell into the story myself (which I love to do) and just couldn't put the book down. Another reader was so spot on with their review...just when you think you have it all figured out the author throws you another curve ball....it's just elaborate enough with twists, love and turns that you will dote on every page. There is a bit of darkness to this story, but a good romance and page turner wouldn't be as enticing without it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is they most fun game I ever played.it is a bit like temple run but has a less complicated way of playing.I love subway surfer
B00866JL96|5.0|I do believe that is the only comment that needs to be made here. They did a pretty good job, I of course read the book first so I love the book a little more. Wonderful soundtrack too.
1439102813|5.0|I work in a nursing home on an alzheimer's unit and I absolutely loved reading this book.  I also lent it out to many other co-workers and they all loved it too.  The author really hit the nail on the head,  and brought the dementia patient's feelings and thoughts to life.  Anyone who works with dementia patients, or the loved ones of a dementia patient would benefit from reading this book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book! I'm a teacher and I would recommend this book to my sixth graders because it US so suspenseful and would hold their interest. Can't wait to read the next one!
B0062ABRDQ|5.0|It was an excellent movie. It was so hard not to dismiss each of the characters for their short comings but by the end you felt so connected to them that you couldn't help but realize how quick we are to distance ourselves from those who do not fit our pictures of how one should be.
B00992CF6W|1.0|HAY! I know a lot of us have a Kindle and play minecraft, so where is our update! Iheard there was an update, so where is it?! HUH?!!!
B005GG0MIS|5.0|First, I am a political history buff.  Secondly, I have read many books on political intrigue and \\"behind the scenes\\"  maneuvering.  But.... this well written  book looked at our national politics from a very unique and refreshing viewpoint.  For example....Watergate is known to all but did you know that Johnson \\"nudged\\" Nixon into taking the path that destroyed his presidency?  Ford helped convince the Senate Republicans to bring the Clinton impeachment hearings to a successful closure?  This wonderful book is like the \\"insider's guide\\" to history and rises above \\"politics as usual\\".  A fast read....and a must read for those who want a refreshing view of our presidential leaders.  Thanks to my darling wife for buying this wonderful book for me!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great horse game. Fun to play. Needs a black horse. More activities would make it better. More ways to get gems would be great as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is way better then temple run. I just love this game! who wouldn't love it.  every body should
B00AIA89HS|5.0|Hatebreed has returned to their roots with this album. It's hard hitting, heavy, and has some of the most brutal tunes you'll ever hear. I was blown away when I started listening to it. One of the best music purchases I've ever made. Buy the album and support these guys, you won't regret it!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My grand daughters loved it. They are 6,4,n1an they were captivated. I ended up buying 2 so they had at both houses

B00A3DZ61W|1.0|Why is this free for everyone else except the Kindle Fire HD? Is that the thanks we get for purchasing your Kindle Fire HD? Thanks alot Amazon. Way to screw your customers.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|As will all Angry Birds, you cannot see the target from the starting point so it makes it a little harder.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game and trying to beat my own scores to get three stars on all levels.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. I can't get enough of it. I think every girl who likes horses should have it!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This is a good game for reasoning.  My granddaughter enjoyed it but the puzzles seemed easy for her.  Fun to try to get them all perfect.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I have read the first two so sometimes I get irratated with the recaps but otherwise another good story line.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I couldn't believe how this game drew me in.  I quickly played all the levels, but then started back through to achieve 3 stars on all levels.  some of them are proving to be a real challenge.  This uses up lots of time, but is hard to put down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Please put in the new update for minecraft pe I t has better graphics and it has baby animals and way better stuff
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Added this to my Kindle so I could record video messages and so far it seems to work well.  Also like the editing tools.  Should be included in the Kindle to begin with.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Extremely illuminating on how we think; especially good on the mistakes our brains make. Not so much a logic machine, more a vast collection of rules-of-thumb.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Perfect conclusion to an excellent series. All the right loose ends were tied up I in the midst satisfying way!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|They went out with a bang with their music selection this time. Great for background and easy listening. Like always, the best song choice for the movie.
B004C4IKCU|5.0|I always give Elvis 5 stars. I bought about 12 Elvis CDs recently so I'm a fan. Many songs that are not played commercially plus many hits - Judy, I Feel So Bad, Stuck On You, I Gotta Know.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|For any air war history buff, &#34;Higher Call&#34;  fits perfectly into ones reading.  A great perspective from the &#34;other side's&#34; point of view.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I am a repeat customer.  These are a good product
B007A2O3FO|3.0|This is a good TV movie for kids and adolesence.  Maggie Smith is always good but I think she has been better. I think the plot was a little light on substance.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Watching all three one after the other is just great. It tells the whole story of Jason Bourne. Great watching.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|He is a much better actor than this.  He must have needed the money cause there was no plot and no story
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I do love this game but its February and there is still Christmas stuff. they should make it where breeding is faster for valentines day.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Great job of acting and tying loose ends from earlier movies.  Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith continue to be awesome
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! I love the graphics and the funny endings for guy dangerous! Thanks for making a fun and addicting game!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|I had heard great things about this movie- but it was a bit of a disappointment.  Would not recommnend or watch agaain.

B005IU1OMA|5.0|Honestly, even if you are not a snowboarding fan this movie is amazingly well done.  An absolute must for any home theater nut looking to show off their system.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This is an excellent book. I enjoy Gillian Flynn's writing thoroughly. I am waiting for her next novel to be released.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Nice puzzle game you can pick up and put down easily. I tend to do a several levels at a time and then take a break!
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I'm just a car chase fan, I like all the Fast and Furious movies when you just want to watch some brain/eye candy and have a good time.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|There are plenty of sounds and settings pre-installed to try to get you to sleep. If that's not enough, you can install more from their marketplace.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|There are some frightening aspects in this movie, but for the most part it's well-done. I would recommend that parents watch the movie with children so they can explain how to handle frightening scenes. I usually tell my grandchildren to cover their eyes if they are afraid during those scenes.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I did get stuck, but there is a lot of help on YouTube out there. This game really caught my attention, and it's unique in that there are several different ways to solve levels.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Sorry Mathew died. He is one of the main stars in this story. If it continues HE will be missed.
B0058BI896|5.0|I purchased it because I wanted it either for my self or a friend or a family member. I graded it with the number of stars I thought it deserved from my view point and that is all I'm willing to do.  You are wadting my time and yours asking for more than that.

B00AEFVRB2|2.0|This movie was definitely a screenplay written for those that think outside the box...made me look at each actor in a different light after viewing this movie. The young girl wasn't one I expected to actually be the star player but she did her part well. I do believe the writer could have put more detail in about why Killer Joe wanted the girl, and the ending left a lot to imagine. All in all, worth a watch but definitely not a buy.

B00A9C3RB8|2.0|This was one I had put off watching for a while, although I had looked forward to it because of it's story line and the stars. No matter how they tried--this couldn't be made less boring. Just a story line that went to nowhere till the last few magical scenes and the music, while really good songs, played so loud i felt like I might wake the neighborhood.Really---this was an unabashed turkey from 2 academy award winners. Can't imagine what they were thinking other than how big their paychecks might be.

B009FZFONO|5.0|The best series yet. My only gripe is that I had to use my playstation 3 exclusively for the hd stream. My xbox 360 slim would never stream in hd.

B009G8GRX6|5.0|This album continues the Muse trend of sounding like the love-child of Queen & Prince.  Just fun all the way through - with music that always surprises you - and pleasantly.

B004PVKFR8|4.0|A fun album - filled with odd beats and surprisingly soft melodies, wedged in between joyous screams. Similar to Family Force 5.

0783116934|5.0|Excellent film and in excellent condition. one of the best film I have purchase so far. one for my collection. one of the best film I have ever seen.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I LOVE this set! I am a Star Wars nut, and for me there could be nothing better. People complain about the CG rock that disappears when R2-D2 is hiding behind it in episode 4. If you look carefully, you can see that it is pushed off to the side. I would definitely recommend this set for anyone who loves Star Wars.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is THE BEST series on television! I find so little to watch on the major networks, I was delighted when I discovered this fabulous show on Amazon Prime. Over the course of a week a watched the first two seasons, and the first 4  episodes of Season 3. Like a good book, I don't ever want the episode to end. I truly have become addicted and many of my friends have as well.  During these cold, dark days of winter, it was a great respite and I felt transported right into Downton Abbey. How great to leave my cares and worries behind!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This program is so entertaining and very well produced.  It is also refreshing to watch a show that is completely appropriate to share with my teenage daughter.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Okay so let me just say this, this is an awesome bag and that's final, especially for the price. Now if you wish to read my full review feel free to do so :) This bag comes in one of amazons frustration free packages which was really nice and my first impressions was that the big was medium sized, not huge which is a good thing! The only thing that I noticed that some people may not like is the fact that amazon promotes themselves with this bag as every single zipper on the bag saids Amazon Basics. This really isn't a problem to me so it won't affect my review on it. The bag itself is very nice in design and it has a pocket in the from that is probably big enough to fit a notebook or a small book. The second bag above it is large enough to fit a small computer. At the end of this review I will list all the things that I have inside of the bag for you to get a feeling of what you can fit inside of it. The main compartment is huge and I simply love it! It has a lot of separated sections which you can move and customize to fit whatever you need to inside! It can also hold a small tripod and is very comfortable to wear. Here is what I currently have inside my AmazonBasics Camera bag!<br /><br />* A Canon EOS Rebel T3i/600D with an 18-55mm lens attached with a revered lens hood for it.<br />* A telephoto lens (75-300mm)<br />* A pretty big lens hood for the telephoto lens<br />* A Speedlite with its attached stand for off camera flash<br />* A Canon Selphy CP900 Portable Printer with its paper holder that is holding 30 photo papers.<br />* A Battery Grip for the Canon T3i<br />* A 10 foot long HDMI Cable to micro HDMI<br />* The charger for the camera and its cable<br />* The AC Adapter and Cable to use the Portable Printer<br />* 6 Batteries for the Camera<br />* 6 SD Cards<br />* My iPad also fits in there in the front pocket<br />* A book to read in the front pocket<br />* A Small/Mini Tripod attached to the Side of the bag<br />* All the manuals and paperwork of the Camera<br />* A 200 Page notebook and 2 pens.<br /><br />After all of this, the bag is pretty much full. There is still however 2 pockets on the side of the bag that I haven't filled. I can probably fit around another 7-8 Batteries in there if I needed to, so hopefully now you can see how much this bag can actually hold!<br /><br />I rate this product a perfect 5 stars out of 5 stars! I hope this review helped you out today!Camera<br />* A 200 Page notebook and 2 pens.<br /><br />After all of this, the bag is pretty much full.

076115678X|5.0|Great book! Gave it to my hairdresser. She loved it. Was pleased with my purchase of this book. Hope it helps.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I am heart broken as I write this review; first because of the last scene in season 3 and second, because it is over for now....what a wonderful story. So full of true life, the loss and heartache, the ecstatic joy of life. Downton is full of lessons and shows how we all are touched by the good and bad, no matter if we are rich or poor. Bravo! Artfully and tastefully done.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like it. I can get the weather almost anywhere I am. You can just get the immediate conditions or a 10 day forecast. One of my favorite apps!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is so much fun and addicting to play. I love it so much I am speechless. It is awesome game.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Although this movie was irrevent.My wife and I thoght the comedy in it was excellent.<br />We would wath more movies like this
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I love the game but after two days it wouldn't come up when I would try to play it. I had to reinstall which took away all my coins then about an hour after that whole process it isn't working correctly again plus this time it doesn't always jump or duck when I swipe.
B000I8FTY6|5.0|I loved Huge Grant as always and I liked he's character even when at first he's a devil may care type.<br />First comes the boy who changes his life who living with his single mother.<br />Second, the the lady he really wants to date and she's the single mother of a young Augustus Prew in tuff kid mode.<br />If you don't know about this fine British actor Augustus Prew by now, you might want to know more once you've seen<br />The Secret of Moonacre Valley.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. But when you connect to Facebook your friends will most likely have a higher score and you want to try to beat them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love how realistic this game is! It makes me feel like I am actually taking care of a real horse! makes me think I actually have real responsibilities with taking care of a horse! I absolutely love this game hands down
0385510454|2.0|This book had the skeleton of a good plot, but it never developed. Tension fizzled at every opportunity, and the romance element was flat. The best part was that it took place in Italy, my favorite country. Otherwise, choose any of Grisham's other books over this one. Not recommended.
B0094KF4WG|3.0|The book starts well. Its not terribly indepth. It reads a bit like an action movie. Shows how tough SEALS can be. Though it can be a bit 'in your face at times'. This man talks so calmly of busting into insurrgents houses and killing men front of their children in the name of the war on terror. Are they the bad guys or are we?<br />The last section of the book regarding the killing of Bin Laden is a little overrun with SEALS whining about the bureaucracy in Washington and the time it takes to get the okay to take Bin Laden's compound, while posturing about how good they themselves are. I have to say, by the end of the book, I liked the author much less than when I started.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game but having issues with collecting coins and when I get so much in coins the coins disappear and then I have to start over in collecting coins. does anyone else have that issue?
B000GCFG7E|3.0|I've read almost all the Reacher books, this one's good, not great.  Still, one could do worse, right? Give it try.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|I loved out, but then again i haven't been disappointed by any of them. Sure, they all have highs and lows but as a series it works
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a fun game to play and very easy to play on the kindle.  I have always played it on my computer and having it on my kindle allows me to take it with me at all times which helps to pass the time when waiting for appointments, etc..
B0070Y46UY|2.0|In light of the graphic depictions of gory killings, I found this book hard to read and I decided not to see the movie since it too is probably very violent.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|discover card is the best and my cat just barft all over my kindle fire hd i love my grand<br />ma
B004J4WNL2|5.0|How little we know about the world of the introvert. My husband certainly wishes that he, a taciturn introvert, had read this many years ago.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I found this book interesting with more twists and curves than a pretzel. I look forward to reading the other two books in the series. This is the first book I have read by this author, but look forward to other works.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My children enjoy this game because of the new graphics and new locations. They however wish there were more characters to choose from.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|This is a great CD for any fan of David Guetta. &#34;Where Them Girls At&#34; is a popular choice and &#34;Lunar&#34; has that sexy beat I love!
0525953728|5.0|This book is fantastic! it is very detailed and entertaining<br /><br />Definitely more thorough than any biased news channel. This guy gives it to you straight
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I got it in the mail in a decent amount of time. It was in good condition. I will read it
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I guess maybe if I had read up on the theme of the story I would have been prepared for how morbid the storyline was. I think it gives kids a very unrealistic perception of death and dying of loved ones. That aside, I feel like Tim Burton has run dry. The characters, story and even the Danny Elfman music has become very tired. It is like he has run out of original material.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this its soo fun just horsein around with this game. I'm glad I got this game. My neice loves it too. So u must get
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The program brings you into a world few see and wings you along with wonderful production design, clever dialogue and great story.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I could see this story happening.  Mitch Rapp has too many close calls for my taste.  I will read more Vince Flynn and Tom Clancy.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Brings back fond memories!!! Too Bad that advertisements always pop up when you want to play... Otherwise It's Still A Classic!!!
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I think my Grandma loved this present! She had just gotten her a DVD player so I wanted to make sure she had a good movie to watch on it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun to play I would recommend it to anyone that likes games . Just try it
1434427986|5.0|It is as advertized, full book, no pages missing or marks inside. Had to buy for a class, so no personal feelings about it.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love one direction so so much I will read anything by them or about them. Thus was a amazing book I would recommend it to everyone who loves one direction.  The boys are so cute and funny I was sad that this book came to an end. There will be other books that I will fall in love with. It's worth what you spend on it.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Amazing Sequel to Delirium. A little slow at first but soon I couldn't put it down. Can't wait for the next one!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It sharpened everything with a wide cutting angle . . .<br /><br />And then I tried sharpening one Chinese knife with no success and thought it was bad. But after I sharpened the same knife with a stone I realized it's not the products fault, the knife just can't be sharpened . . .
B008X77K8W|5.0|I have most of Chris's albums, and of course, had to have the newest. Great sound. For those who haven't heard Chris, He's a little like Steve Earl without the Commie B.S.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|There are some strange twists in Season 3 but I'm still hooked. I'm looking forward the show to start back up on AMC on feb 10th.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the first time that I have read this classic. The author writes very well and reveals an historic sense the is real. It is a good experience to be caught up in this historical drama.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Well if you ask me I would say great but I think there is a glitch because my friend can  buy a trading portal and she is a level 8 and I am a level 20 we tried everything to help e get it. We tried an update but there wasn't one then we tried reinstalling it and we still didn't get the portal and stormie has all these buildings and I can't even get one.My friend and I still don't get it. We think the creator needs to either let everyone get the buildings and trading portal or don't let anyone back able to get it at all.
B001B3MCQK|5.0|Love this guys songs. He was ahead of his time ! Would recommend seeing the movie Searching for Sugarman also...such a great story.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It's nice to have all the films and notice details missed before.<br />Great for a rainy afternoon. I really enjoy having all the films on hand.
1594488886|5.0|I really liked this book.  I was going to avoid it knowing that it would upset me.  I wanted to read it for the Women Thrive online book club though because I thought that it is a way to work on rights for women in Southeast Asia.  I did feel badly and angry, but I felt as if I was working.  That is also why the 5 stars.<br /><br />It is an amazing story about the treatment of women in a conservative society.  I was happy and surprised that a man that grew up in such a society was able to draw women so well and sympathetically.  Now I shall have to read the his earlier book on flying kites.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is so much better than the 1st one it should be five stars. if there was more than five stars I would give it max
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great read! Really good twists and turns. very unexpected ending and plot. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone
B004LWZW2E|5.0|I thought this movie was a good horror movie and had some exciting parts worth watching if you are into the horror genre.  It is always disturbing to me to see children possessed or having a bad time in life.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|The charger Works well for not being an apple product. I received it in the mail within reasonable timing. I would recommend this product.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Ok, it is animated, but the animation is great and there is a good story line.  It is  a good sci-fi movie and certainly worth watching a few times.
0143039431|5.0|My daughter needed this book for summer reading and it came without any problems. It is a good book to have in your library.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite horror author and this is definately one of his best works.  The book is also awesome and one that you can really get into.  This movie can give you nightmares and makes you not like clowns...
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game!! Lots of fun!! You have to think a lot and that's great for you brain. It wasn't terribly challenging a lot of fun.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|This is what made a generation love cops.  They got things done to get rid of criminals the way people thought it should be done.  It's a little dated, but still good action and excitment.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Everyone loves this game  It is addicting once you play it you cannot stop one of the best free apps
B000KJT8IG|5.0|This movie is a Christmas favorite and contains many funny scenes and situations which many people actually face during their lifetime.  Really funny and great acting.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I looked for this because I really enjoy the Persona games. All the characters are great and the story is well fleshed out. I would totally recommend this to anyone looking for an interesting RPG.
B002ZFQD0Y|5.0|Serj Tankian expertly blends a philharmonic orchestra with his unique lyrics and message in a way that I have never seen anything similar to.  The music is fantastic and even superior to his studio albums, in my opinion.  The quality of the DVD is excellent, as well.
B004SBULWE|5.0|My Kindle kept losing its battery quickly and I was having to charge it twice a day after little usage.  After getting this app i was able to close several apps that open to refresh themselves and save my battery!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome because there is a whole lot of twists and turns that can make you go crazy!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a story that does not need to be told!  It is a silly excuse for a book in that the entire premise is foolish.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'd have liked a little different ending, but all-in-all, a great series. Can't wait for the next movie in the series to come out.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|They paid the ultimate price. This Nation owes a big debt of gratitude towards our men and women in the military , doing the jobs most of us would never attempt. A Special thanks to our Navy Seals, the best in the world!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So far better than the original. The graphics are more detailed. Game play is very good and seems to get tougher as you advance.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is amazing and great it is a great game to pass a lot of time it has ziplines, cart in tunnels of rock also one bad thing is that it keep as asking if you would like to rate this app but you c as n tell them to not tell you again to rate it but overall it is pretty good game I would recommend it for everyone if you don't have temple run I have that too it is good to so you should really get it best app it great
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Having recently visited Southport, NC and being told about the book and pending movie, I felt drawn to read Safe Haven before the movie release.  Sparks did a great job bringing all the pieces together and building up to the finale.  BTW...Southport is a great place to get away from it all.  Mike S. - Annandale VA
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very nice app a little confusing about the PLEASE stand by for so many hours but otherwise a wonderful app I'd recommend it for any body with any tablet to keep track of exactly how much battery life is left
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two books and her writing style, but this book is a little slow and a little too predictable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game, but I can't figure out how to update it! I have it on kindle fire. If you know,please help me!!!
B004HD61KE|3.0|I've enjoyed Rollins in the past, to be quite honest.  However, this book draws very heavily on historical figures that we all recognize, and presumably admire, without a plot line that seems feasible to me. Nowadays there's apparently a renewed<br />interest in our country in what could be called Colonial America, President Lincoln example.  Meacham's new biography<br />of Jefferson seems to be another reflection of public interest in the era of the founders.  Politicians routinely invoke what they<br />call &#34;the founding founders,&#34; to bolster their positions on one issue or another.  So the stage is set, so to speak, for a lively<br />adventure in that time frame.  In this instance, I felt a bit disappointed in the plot's unreality, so to speak.  There's just too<br />much emphasis on mindless adventurism that winds up being awfully boring to this reader.  I could give more examples,<br />but don't want to spoil the surprises for future readers.  It's just okay, in my opinion.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|I rather enjoyed it have read a few Jack Reacher books and this one was just as good as others that I have read
B00AREIAI8|4.0|lots of fun to play. no bugs or problems. my toddler loves it its easy enough for him to play himself. he loves feeding the horse.
B000FCKL6G|5.0|I remember living through the days when the survival of IBM was a hot topic of discussion.  It was very interesting to read Gerstner's account of the obstacles he faced and how he overcame them to accomplish what many thought couldn't be done.  I hated for the book to end because it was such an enjoyable read.  Any student of management should include this book in his/her library.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Fantastic movie; however it would have been much better if the director had been allowed to make it the way he envisioned, rather than PCing it down.
B007CW2FCA|5.0|Each measure, each movement, each sonata is so rich, I am virtually addicted to listening over and over again. Arrau's piano playing is the pinnacle of performance, conveying with nuance and originality the full range of Beethoven's musical and emotional palette--from profound depth to dancing delight. Truly a transcendent experience!
B00177YA1K|5.0|Slowly replacing VHS with DVD -- this was one of them.  I already liked the move; now I can watch it without worrying about the VHS breaking or degrading in quality.
1400031001|2.0|This endless, wordy, shapeless book bewilders me. How can Time magazine call it the best of the year? It seems to me to be the product of the author wondering if he thread a fictional narrative through the likes of Hemingway, various royalty, and Picasso, and -- if he does -- if anyone will even stay with him. It must be men who like this book. Perhaps his previous reputation bought him boundless credibility. I felt roundly ripped off.
B000067J1Y|4.0|was purchased to replace VHS copy -- Funny movie, but sequel was better.  Can't really say any more than that
B0064W639K|5.0|Though I am not the biggest comic book reader, I can't help but love this one. Tim Sales art is really cool, and the story has many elements that were later added to Nolan's batman films.<br /><br />If you're not sure about comics, this is a good place to star.
B00004WG2F|4.0|I somehow missed viewing this movie when it was in theatres.<br />I was attracted to it by some music from the soundtrack so<br />decided to buy it.<br />The scenery and cinematography are wonderful even though<br />the story has many dark turns.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I love this movie.  It is very funny and the acting was very good.  Also, the special effects were great. I recommend this movie to all of those who enjoyed the first and second installments.
B004UID2LC|2.0|I feel this app only wants to work when it feels like it. It always freezes up and for days at a time.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|Not much to review - the adapter works fine between thunderbolt (computer) and FireWire800.  I pluged a FW400 to FW800 cable into it and connected a FW400 computer as an external disk.  Works fine.  I have not tested its ability to supply power to a FW device.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is great for someone that hunts or uses knives quite a bit.  They can take it anywhere they want to take it.  It's small and fits right in your pocket.  Great Product!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'm a big fan of Pinterest &amp; was thrilled to find kindle fire app.  unfortunately the app is buggy &amp; needs more work.  App freezes and then closes automatically; so must frequently restart. Please fix!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is one of, if not the best,<br />television show, foreign or domestic, that has been made. I'm completely and irrationally in love with it.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|If you are a Jane Austen fan, and want to read more about the adventures of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth AFTER Price and Prejudice, this is a fun read. Don't take it too seriously - if you are a Jane Austen purist, you may not want to read this - but I enjoyed it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Mars is popular.  The science.  The human adventure.  The pop culture aspects.  I'm not surprised there are this many reviews for a book that costs a buck.  And, I'm not surprised there are so many 5 star ratings.  This book is good.<br /><br />But look a little deeper, and you'll find a story rich in the texture and architecture of a desperate struggle for survival.  Mars is the stage, and as we learn more about the red planet every day, the more tangible it becomes.  But this story is less a framework for human existence on Mars, and more an engaging, approachable accounting of one man's ingenuity when faced with incalculable odds.  It gets \\"mathy\\" on several occasions, but it's not distracting.  It's a consistent enough level of detail.<br /><br />I forgot I only paid 99 cents.  Worth a lot more.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|If you like off-beat mysteries, read this one! Fun, quirky, and entertaining, and a little bit of suspense - worthwhile.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|Not the worlds greatest science fiction movie but it’s a decent story line.  Life in a hypothetical world where everyone “tunes in, turns on and drops out”.  Sort of the ultimate work from home idea, plug into a cord and have a robot be you for the day.<br /><br />I happen to like all the actors in it so its entertaining.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|If you like quirky and off-beat, with some mystery thrown in, this is a fun read. I enjoyed the story and the characters...
B0064T6LV8|5.0|If you remember the old pinball machines you will like this game it works just like the old pinball machines you used to play with the flippers and all.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Pretty captivating game.  Solid story and plenty of mini games.  There are a lot of things to do, and it really makes you wonder what will cone to pass.  I give it 4 stars.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so fun because I have always wanted a horse and this is so very realistic
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app but I need help it won't let me have my normal guest profile. I don't have a Facebook and I filed a report cuz I ain't to happy. But this is my favorite app!!! I need your help BINGO!!!
B0090YHSFC|3.0|its a game, it can be fun and it's a bit quirky. I think my kids would like it more then I do
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best apps ever! And the best part is its totally free! It's got more obstacles and the monkey chasing you is a lot better. This is not a waste its the best APP EVER!!
B0094K1QR8|1.0|I was so bored while watching this that I could scarcely draw breath. This has SO been done, and done and done again.

B000A6CLL0|5.0|Great series, pity it had to end before it's time. Looking forward to the next Star Trek movie.<br />Live long and prosper!
B009GED3HS|5.0|couldn't wait to see it on Netflix some months from now...worth every dollar I paid! Specially if you cant watch the show on TV.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I enjoy the mix of natural sounds with the choices of ethereal music to accompany them.  I think these combined with the Theta waves provides the best possible way to lull yourself to sleep.  It even works for me when my RLS symptoms are at their worst!
B00633W614|5.0|I am so into this series! The dynamics between the 2 families builds & builds. The storyline keeps me breathlessly waiting for the next chapter as the lovers are torn apart yet again. I will not give the story away. Read it for yourself!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|No blood, no violence, no guns, no monsters.. Thank you so much.  It's soothing and challenging and completely enjoyable.  Worth trying.
B00280LYIC|3.0|This would be a very good book for young teens. I enjoyed reading it, and it kept my interest. The language and content would be excellent for young people. As a retired teacher, I enjoy finding books that I would recommend for children of all ages.
B00A12VW86|5.0|This is my favorite of the three releases... The songs are a mix of old and new sounds and you can hear a little Sgt. Pepper influence along with rockabilly and other genres. While Uno has my favorite song - Let Yourself Go - I listen to every song from DOS and never get tired of it.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|Any assistance?  I've tried multiple time and do not want to uninstall/reinstall to get update.  Error indicates a bad signature.....  Is there any type of support?
B0007D5FZK|3.0|I chose this rating because there is only one thing I dislike about this item, I can't fit both discs in, one falls out.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I thought that this app would allow me to download books to my samsung Galaxy tablet - but it always says that it does not recognize my reader.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I bought this for my wife for Christmas and found myself listening to it as well.  I was never anti-Taylor, but thought she was maybe a bit too girly for my taste.  I was wrong.  She is a great songwriter with great vocals.  There's some really nice mature material on here, along with the pop candy.  She deserves the accolades.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I would not recommend this book to anyone.  Basically, the ending was &#34;The End!!!.  There was absolutely no need for the base descriptions either.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|There is something unusual about Ellie Goulding's voice, and that is a good thing.  I don't think anyone out there sounds like her.  Also, she happens to be a good songwriter and the songs are well-crafted, sticking in your head.  I believe she has a bright future and I look forward to other offerings.
B004QIG7CW|5.0|Great story line, motivational, even the adult family enjoys it.  Daughter watches it as a treat!  Do not like the fact that you make me write a minimum of words so I am writing just to fulfill your request.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I read this book in 3 sittings and had a hard time putting it down.  I appreciate Dave's honesty in not sugar coating the mistakes and downright bad decisions in his life.  He seems like a genuine person who is trying to make good.  Of course, you can't argue with his musical catalog either (the musical journey is well documented here too), so if you're a Megadeth fan, pick this up.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Taken -  is a movie that EVERY young girl and her parents should watch. It scary to think how fast young people can find themselfs in trouble.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|You can't say they're not catchy.  They have a great pop sensibility without sounding cliched. Also, I was really struck by how the lead singer changes his vocal attack from tune to tune -  it makes for great variety.  Go buy it and see for yourself!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|A wonderful movie that deals with real life issues in a funny way but still realalistice. Both actors are absolutly wonderful.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Is use this app to share notes, lists, records, and thoughts between my desktop, laptop, and iPhone. It works flawlessly.
0743233832|5.0|I cannot recommend this book enough! For those who are concerned about the accuracy of the translation, I cannot comment one way or the other. This is the only translation that I have read, however, I chose this version by comparing various passages against other translations. In my opinion, The Emperor's handbook was the one most poetic. I will be reading this one again!
B001O22ELQ|5.0|It made me laugh and had enough unforeseen twist to surprise me. The cast was great, and a few of the songs are kind of catchy.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love hidden object games this is a good one wish it had more levels it seemed to be over too soon
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This is a great movie. I love the story as it involves forgiveness, redemption and resurrection and a little lion love story that is all G rated, its a great movie with great music to sing along with.
B008476HBM|4.0|Jolly good read - deservedly one of the most famous novels ever - can't believe it is now 200 years old - although the word pride does not carry the same opprobrium today as it did then  and prejudice is probably a greater evil today as it was then- probably worth thinking if it as Arrogance and  antipathy
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The book was a fun read. There was a lot that happened at the beginning, but once the book got going it got better. Beginning was a bit confusing for this reason, but overall good fun romantic book.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Just another great Action Movie to watch just ordered taken 2 also !<br />Looking forward to watching it too !!!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I really enjoy the Jack Reacher series and this novel is a great addition to my collection.  If you like Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, you will not be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This would be worth using if it actually worked properly. It's so annoying waiting and waiting and waiting for the pages to never load. I have the fastest internet available and you would never know it. If this could be fixed that would be AWESOME!!!
1595825045|5.0|If you're a fan of this show, or even just animation and art in general, this book is definitely worth your while.  Amazing artwork, as well as insight into inspiration and design from the creators themselves.<br /><br />Also, the shipping was great.  I ordered Super Saver shipping, and I had the book in my hands less than 48 hours from when I placed the order.
B004J4WLPU|3.0|I was attracted to this book because of the close relationship I have with my sisters.  I think Rosamund Lupton got this part of her book right.  I could see how much Bee and Tess loved each other.  I could see how devastated Bee was by Tess's death.  I appreciated Bee's search for the truth.  I even enjoyed the rather contrived, but nevertheless engaging, first person narrative.  However, I was very disappointed with the ending.  I didn't feel any real surprise, just some confusion.  It made me feel that Tess's death was even more senseless.  Too bad.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|I love this app I watch all my music videos on it and justin bieber videos I really recommend it
B001KP2J3U|5.0|THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT WORK BY AGATHA CHRISTIE.  USTINOV IS GREAT AS THE DETECTIVE & THERE ARE MANY MANY TOP STARS ABOURD.
B002BWTN0I|5.0|Over the years, before I started reviewing books, I have read 3 books by Benjamin Hoff--The Tao of Pooh, The Te of Piglet, and The Mystical Nature Diary of Opal Whiteley and enjoyed each of them.  Every now and then, some books are so good that I just have to read them again.  That is the case with The Tao of Pooh.<br /><br />Among other things, Hoff is an exceptionally talented author.  I am amazed that he was able to explain the basics of Taoism via A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh characters.  I have read hundreds of self-help books and numerous books on Taoism, but none explain the basic tenets as much as this one does and besides, Pooh makes me laugh out loud!<br /><br />Benjamin uses Eeyour, Piglet, Rabbit, the Owl, Pooh, Tigger, Kanga, Roo and Christopher Robin brilliantly in the nine chapters of this 157-page explanation of the concepts of Taoism as a \\"particular way of appreciating, learning from, and working with whatever happens in everyday life.\\" It is a lesson in awareness as in taking the time to really see, listen, smell, taste, touch and feel nature just as it is.<br /><br />He translates, simplifies and explains ancient Taoism and stories in terms we can understand how this way of life can be used in everyday life though Milne's humorous characters.<br /><br />This book has been translated in many languages--Chinese, Japanese, Hebrew, German, Spanish and more--and is also sold in a set with The Te of Piglet.<br /><br />I thoroughly appreciate this short wisdom book and bet you will too!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004CURZFC|4.0|LEGEND OF THE GUARDIANS: THE OWLS OF GA'HOOLE  The story was good & the pictures were very good.  Art work was very well done.  Good for the young.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|The critics said it was brilliant but they didn't think it would earn repeated listens. When are the critics going to quit underestimating us? Each album Fiona releases is better than the last. If you want to listen to a smart, funny, amazing talent and come along for the ride as she perfects her craft, get not just this album but her entire discography. And the next one.
B0016OLC5Q|5.0|I  loved  this  movie. It  was  so  interesting  and  entertaining! I did have some connection issues, but nothing too bad.
0743270754|5.0|Team of Rivals - the Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, is a long, funny, weighty, worthy, and well-written book over 900 pages. This book captivated me for over a month. At times brilliant and others mundane, the book leaves one feeling like they are living through the tough choices of our 16th president. In my opinion, this book solidified for me that Abraham Lincoln is undoubtedly the best President.<br /><br />The book diverges from the movie in showing the early life of Lincoln, the rise to running for Republican primary, Lincoln's tour on he circuit, the viewpoints of his rivals, and the lives of some prominent women of the 19th century. I firmly believe that the book is a more accurate portrayal of Lincoln. The premise of the book is taken from others' view of Lincoln and his impact on them.<br /><br />While not prefect in any means, one walks away with the feeling of being in the presence of a great individual. Lincoln's entire life from his stories, generally humble demeanor, toiling over his speeches, dealing with political opponents, and knowing his role as commander-in-chief all culminate into a well-rounded individual. Looking at his view that African Americans would be better relocated early in his presidency, Lincoln finally evolved his thinking and fought for the God-given rights of African Americans. In addition the Civil War was fought over state's rights - namely, do the southern confederacy states have the right to slavery.<br /><br />These points in the book are all worth mentioning:<br /><br />Lincoln was self-taught: Page 152, we see Lincoln struggling with mathematics - Euclid, and being deeply absorbed until he mastered the subject. He also believed that \\"life was a school.\\"<br /><br />On page 165, \\"Lincoln (while debating) produced a conviction in others because of the conviction of the speaker (Lincoln) himself.\\"<br /><br />Read the Gettysburg Address on page 586 - the most moving speech ever recorded.<br /><br />Page 719 - Lincoln coming into the recent captured capital of the Confederacy - a group of black Union soldiers surrounding Lincoln and bowing to him; Lincoln wanted him to pray only to God. The scene is almost surreal with the end of the war coming to an end.<br /><br />If you enjoy early 19th American history - this book is a must read.<br /><br />Just my opinion...g into the recent captured capital of the Confederacy - a group of black Union soldiers surrounding Lincoln and bowing to him; Lincoln wanted him to pray only to God. The scene is almost surreal with the end of the war coming to an end.<br /><br />If you enjoy early 19th American history - this book is a must read.<br /><br />Just my opinion...
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show has a great story and plot with a great cast of actors. I can't get enough of this show, it is so awesome.

B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I bought this DVD for my wife.  she absolutely LOVED it!  I will probably have to buy the other seasons.
0307720748|5.0|As many, I also admire Richard Branson. It's easy reading, funny at times, inspiring of course, but most importantly it comes across as very genuine.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Love the way this book was so easy to read. I finished it in one day because I just could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best on the ENTIRE market! It is a must have! Stop reading this and buy it already! P.S. it's free!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the story line. I can't wait for the next book to come. May seems so so so far away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game forever for life.great game love it very much for the game.Love  walteria phelps love this game forever.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|The color is soft and warm. The strap is comfortable to wear. This is an automatic watch so when wearing it your movement keeps the watch working. Al in all the watch works great and I'm happy with its looks and the function because it keep the time well. Great purchase. Yes I highly recommend this purchase.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|It was ok. It was pretty predictable, but I also have friends who like to tell me what's going to happen. I've been told the others are better.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Only gave it 5 stars because I couldn't give it more. One of the best series ever on tv. I resisted so long because of the English  accents - you really have to concentrate and listen closely. But within 5 minutes of series one, episode one - I was hooked. Amazing show. Everyone at work loves it and it's frequently the topic of conversation.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the best game ever. I am addicted to it. I play it every day. Go temple run 2. You rock!
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|If you like andrea bocelli, then you'll definitely find this cd worth to own. However, I couldn't give it 5 stars due to the song selection. I agree with other reviewers that mentioned these songs are too easy.<br /><br />I really like this version of \\"quizas, quizas, quizas\\", but Jennifer Lopez ruins it. I would have liked for him to sing it alone, or at least with a different female that can keep up with his voice. I think the only reason they did this was to reach out to a different audience. That's my opinion.<br /><br />My favorite song in \\"champagne\\"!! I highly recommend listening to this song!
B005HJAOLY|4.0|Stephen King is the Master. Held me as always, opened it and finished it. I just didn't feel there was an ending to it.
B000ICZD4I|5.0|We at the the restaurant before knowing of the movie. We ordered the movie to see how well it depicted the town.
B00B2166BS|5.0|No regrets.  Shipped from CA to FL in 3 business days, via USPS.  Works great out of the bag.  Magnet clamps firmly.  Anybody wanting a longer cord could add a 3 foot M-F \\"USB extension cord\\" to the charger end.  YMMV, I find six foot charge cables a bit of a nuisance, but so is camping out next to an outlet.  Those saying wait for lower cost alternatives may have a long wait, given the past history of custom accessories for Google devices.  For the impatient, be careful what you wish for, a slow charge is better for battery life.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|If you have a 3D TV and player, this should be your first movie on the list to buy.  It is a great movie in 3D with stunning special effects.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Tommy Lee Jones delivers his lines and his character flawlessly. He is the only reason, the movie received two stars instead of one-half. Unfortunately, the story was just stupid.  Most of the conversations were not interesting and the movie definitely was not entertaining.  I just kept shaking my head in disappointment while listening to the dialogue between the couple and the therapist.  It just did not work - sorry to say.
B008YE9CEO|3.0|The book has some notable wear but it came on time and is in good condition. The plot surrounds two stories interwoven in a new way. Fascinating, as well as unusual.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|After Steely Dan made a brief return to the land of the living with &#34;Two Against Nature&#34; (2000) and &#34;Everything Must Go&#34; (2003), Donald Fagen likewise seemingly capped his solo trilogy off with &#34;Morph The Cat&#34; (2006) which, with its themes of aging and death in an increasingly hostile world, brought closure to a life that started so optimistically in &#34;The Nightfly&#34; (1982). After this, what could Fagen possibly have to say?<br /><br />In &#34;Sunken Condos,&#34; it turns out, the answer is &#34;plenty.&#34; If &#34;Morph&#34; seemed a bit apocalyptic, then &#34;Condos&#34; is post-apocalyptic, right down to the cover image of a Miami drowned by climate change. And indeed, &#34;Weather in My Head&#34; uses climate change as a metaphor for internal conflict in a straight-ahead blues that may well be this album's first hit single. &#34;Memorabilia&#34; is pure atomic-age chic, a sort of bookend to &#34;New Frontier,&#34; with its images of 1950s H-bomb tests (&#34;Color film of Castle Bravo/Girl you know that shot was huge&#34;). &#34;Miss Marlene&#34; could easily be a remembrance from Fagen's own youth, complete with a reference to James Bond's heyday, only transplanted to Generation Y (&#34;back in double-O-seven...&#34;). And &#34;I'm Not The Same Without You&#34; is one of the best breakup songs ever; one could easily imagine it being sung by, say, Superman after dumping Lois Lane, or Galadriel minus Celeborn, in alternate versions of their respective universes. On the other hand, the album as a whole seems a bit less cohesive than &#34;Morph&#34; (or especially &#34;Kamakiriad&#34;), perhaps because it's overall theme is a bit harder to characterize than those earlier albums; &#34;Good Stuff,&#34; a throwback to the 1920s gangster era, is IMHO the album's weakest track, while &#34;Out of the Ghetto,&#34; an Isaac Hayes cover, inexplicably juxtaposes images of the Black ghettos of the 70s with Jewish ghettos of the 1930s by throwingbits of klezmer into what would otherwise be straightforward funk.<br /><br />As might be expected from Fagen's experience both with and after Steely Dan, the musicianship is superb, as is the recording quality. (If you're putting this on your iPod or media server, it's worth the space to do it lossless.)<br /><br />If you're a fan of the Knights of the Metal Leg, this album is of course a must-have. But even if you're completely unacquainted with either Steely Dan or Donald Fagen's solo work and are considering this album 'de novo,' &#34;Sunken Condos&#34; stands in its own right as an excellent example of Fagen's artistry.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|you know when you cant of the word or how to spell it then this is good to have around
B009LROCJI|5.0|Everyone knows The Four Seasons.  But Richter's new interpretations bring something special, new, and very listenable.  I had first heard an interview with Richter and some teaser clips on NPR (I'll bet you can find the interview on their website), and I was intrigued enough to want to buy it.  I'm very glad it did.<br /><br />It's sort of like hearing a \\"remix\\" of Vivaldi -- familiar, and yet fresh, new, and in many ways \\"not quite familiar\\".  The word \\"Recomposed\\" in the title is accurate, I guess, but I more imagine this recording as more modern -- more remix, where Richter, as the composer's equivalent of a DJ, pulls out and highlights themes or melodies that you might never have heard in the original, or are inventions to enhance and complement the original.  The same song, but different.  I actually get drawn in to paying attention in a new way, hearing the same tunes we all know, but not the same -- really intriguing listening.  The production is also quite nice, with seamless, almost ethereal transitions between the movements/tracks.<br /><br />If you never thought you'd actually purchase something as common and overplayed at The Four Seasons, or didn't need yet another CD of these same old pieces, you might want to reconsider.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have not watched the movie, but was intrigued by the preview.  I got the book in November, but kept putting it down because the beginning had so many factoids and details that it seemed like the story was just boring and pointless.....but when the plot finally started, I was hooked, couldn't put it down.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|Loved playing this game, until I hit around Level 30. It has now locked up and will not open AT ALL. I play this with my son, but we have not been able to play for a couple of days because it will not open! Perhaps an update is needed to fix this glitch.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Video quality not great on season 1 episode 11. But show is great. I highly recommend watching it. Funny with great story lines.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I downloaded the TR2 it worked like a charm and was much more fun filled that the previous version, but now it won't load up on my Kindle Fire? Can we get some support please?!
B00B2V66VS|2.0|First, the good: the new setting is pretty and a nice change from the original. I like the small touches-- swinging on the ropes and such. I'm also a big fan of the missions within the game. I always think that aspect makes for a more enjoyable game, long-term.<br /><br />The bad: the lag and lack of tilt sensitivity makes this game unplayable. I've lost many lives because the game doesn't register my swipe correctly. Of course, you may think this my fault, not the game, but it occurs with much greater frequency than in Temple Run 1. I also have to tilt my device to an extreme angle for the game to register the side to side movement.<br /><br />For these reasons, I am removing the game from my device.
B00B2EWNWG|2.0|This movie starts out with a story that seems promising but as it progresses it just falls short of being an interesting movie. I give it 2 1/2 bags of popcorn in my rating.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|This movie was good, and the second one was even better. The third one was a piece of poop though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|iI could not put this book down. My Husband thought I was more interested in the book than him! Loved it!!!!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Wow I'm not sure we're to begin a wonderful story with it's twist and turns. I so can not wait for the 3rd one in the cross series I want to read it like now.
B006O3MU96|5.0|Fun for winter, helps me feel the Christmas spirit by using it so I don't become a bord old screwdge.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome cant believe  the ending wow what a cool ending recommend this book to ms students very entertaining to all
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great sequel to the first one! The reason for only 4 stars.......It did freeze on me. I had to uninstall and  re-download so I lost all my progress :-( . Outside of that, no complaints, besides it's free. The additions are to this one are really good
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so much fun n since I'll never have the money for a real horse this is a good idea of how it would be lol I'm addicted.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I use this in a small studio so we can use multiple headphones from only one stereo line out.  Individual volumes controls make it perfect.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A sexy steamy follow-up to book one. You can see the relationship developing, find out the causes of Christian's childhood trauma and watch a man overcome his inner demons. From the ending, it looks like book three will have a suspense story line, hopefully it will still h ave the hot steamy and playful sex scenes too!<br /><br /> it was as steamy as the first book with some great twists and turns at the end. Definitely leaves you wanting to read the final book in the series.
B002APU580|5.0|There are many versions of this story so which to pick?  This one!  My daughter's favorite - no wonder I had to get it for her!
0670026603|5.0|I was trying to find a new book and had some samples on my Kindle.  I wanted something good to read that would keep me interested.  I never imagined when I started reading in the morning, that I would pick the book up again in the early evening and continue to read it until I finished at 1:30am!  Needless to say, it was a good book and I was exhausted the next day!<br /><br />I am taking about Me Before You by Jojo Moyes.  The book description intrigued me.  The story is about Louisa, who has just lost her job and is searching for a new one.  She is from a working class family and her family depends on her income.  After many attempts to find employment, she interviews for a job working as a caregiver to a man that is a quadriplegic.<br /><br />Will was in an accident which left him unable to move from the neck down.  He is young, angry and not the friendliest.  Louis is challenged and without giving anything away, she finds out exactly why she was hired, which changes her life in so many ways.<br /><br />This is a great book.  So many terrific characters and issues to discuss.  This would be a wonderful book club selection.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next.
B005M5XCZ8|1.0|This item was not as advertised. Did not have DVD in it. It was just blue ray and digital copy.
B005WMQFOQ|5.0|This Barbie Collector Rear Window GK Doll looked beautiful on the Amazon website, but when it is seen in real life, it is absolutely exquisite.  The facial expression bears a genuine likeless to the real Grace Kelly, so its not just another generic Barbie dressed up as a Hollywod star.  The detail on the dress is superb, and so close to the original film that Edith Head would be so impressed by Mattel's reproduction!  The overall presentation of this doll screams class, elegance and old Hollywood style, even to the presentation box she comes in. There is no need to even remove her from the special presentation box, in fact she could be displayed in the box and still look delightful.  If anyone is a fan of GK then this doll is a must buy even if you are not usually a doll collector.

B007HACDLK|4.0|With enough twists and turns to make it interesting, this latest chapter in Mitch Rapp's famous career is a fun read even if it telegraphs the plot twists a bit too loudly in places.  I enjoyed it, but I don't think it is as exciting as some of his earlier work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was fantastic! There were so many twists and turns that I never knew what was going to happen which I absolutely loved.I changed my allegiances to characters a number of times. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good mystery.
B004LWZW6U|4.0|You can imagine my disappointment when I realized neither my DVD player or PS3 would play the 3D version.  However, I was able to watch the DD version and it was excellent.  Close up and personal with giant ancient piranha from deep pools beneath the Earth.  Didn't they learn from the previous attack that you can't fill a pool with hundreds of people at a specical event and not expect the piranha to crash the party. Lots of bouncing bossoms.<br />A couple notable performances by Christopher Lloyd and David Hasselhoff to liven it up with some additional comedy.  This is a great eat popcorn and laugh movie.  This is not a thinking SciFi movie like [[ASIN:B001THAS5K The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008)]], so don't even think about it, just have fun with it.<br /><br />CA Luster
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it awesome I love it is better because it has more opsticles to do. if you don't like it why its not that bad.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Not what I expected.  It was ok.  I thought there would be more detail about his Heavenly experience and less about what lead up to his experience.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|I bought this album on a whim from hearing only a few song of theirs. I didn't know what to expect, this was almost a blind purchase. I know little of this band but I must say I am blown away!  This is a magnificent album filled with life and great energy. I would highly recommend this album to anyone hesitating to purchase this album. The style of music is fesh and invented, unlike anything I've heard. It has a little bit of everything. I'm VERY satisfied.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|The instructions are muddled and confusing, after I finally got it assembled I was unable to actually cut the bottles.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Started out very entertaining.  It seems to be focusing more on the &#34;dark&#34; side of the story, which is not as appealing to me personally.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Good read and an honor to have this story shared. I don't know what else to say about this book
B000FA675C|5.0|I just not finished the book and its got to be one of the best book ive read so far!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is a very engaging game. so may levels some very challenging. yes, it was free but the ads are such an annoyance.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games is a book I could not put dpwn read the wholw thing in two days! Totally amazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I originally thought that Temple Run, being more popular, would be better than this. Within one play I was hooked. genuinely good game for all ages. &infin;
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best ive had to say, full of exiting scenes I cant wait till they make the movie.
B003X27L9U|3.0|Very interesting style of writing, in the voice of a 5 year old.<br />You cant help getting sucked into the story and it's a real page turner.<br /><br />Sadly though I found it lost a lot of momentum, like a train pulling slowly into the station.<br />A little bit of an anti-climax at the end, which is why I rated it a 3.5
B006LSZECO|5.0|The novel kept you guessing until the end.! A very good read. What is with this mandated # or words. People will stop doing reviews because of this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it to bits!!!<br />Its was such a change from what i'm reading at the moment and I just loved it!!!<br /><br />Suzanne transports you to this world that is so bizarre , yet could be so real.<br />Its a bit like the movie &#34;Avatar&#34;<br /><br />A real page turner with twists in the plot at every corner!!<br />Read it in three days and already on the second book
B005IQZB14|5.0|From start to finish this was an incredible story of Cheryl's journey. The introspective parts were excellent, did not ramble on as some introspectives seem to do. Very vivid descriptions. She did not make herself out to be perfect at all and let us know tht it was a healing journey for herself. I will probably read this again and have recommended it to many.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|Yes yes I followed the masses and downloaded the book. What a load of rubbish.<br />I read all three but really I shouldve just downloaded the spoilers after the first and gotten the &#34;in a nutshell version&#34;<br /><br />Dont waste your time!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Being a big fan of time travel stories and of course the mysteries surrounding the JFK assassination, I was instantly drawn to this book.  Though I don't exactly share the same views as King regarding the Assassination, IE who all was involved, lone gunman/multiple gunman, etc. I was not disappointed in the least by this book.  I looked forward to each and every page as King took me on an amazing adventure, perfectly capturing the late 50's and early 60's with amazing detail.  The characters were colorful and full of life.  At times I even found myself connecting with the villain, Lee Harvey Oswald himself.  Midway into the book I couldn't wait for the Oswald confrontation, for this terrible little man to meet his just end, then King spun it just the right way and I saw how human Oswald really was.  How even a monster still had love for his little girl.  Overall a truly great book by King.  As I said in the title it's one of the best books I've read by him in years, perhaps ever.  The thing that has always bothered me about his books is his lack of ability to finish them with a satisfying ending.  This one, for once did not disappoint.  A truly wonderful piece of fiction.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Yes yes I followed the masses and downloaded the book. What a load of rubbish.<br />I read all three but really I shouldve just downloaded the spoilers after the first and gotten the &#34;in a nutshell version&#34;<br /><br />Dont waste your time!!
B003L77G10|5.0|I have enjoyed this show from the very first program. It can be watched several times and still be enjoyed. Often the unexpected happens and it is easy to get involved with the characters as they make their way out of difficult cases and situations. Definitely one to watch. Looking forward to getting Series 3. If you enjoy legal dramas then this is definitely one to get.
B007KZY1YY|1.0|Yes yes I followed the masses and downloaded the book. What a load of rubbish.<br />I read all three but really I shouldve just downloaded the spoilers after the first and gotten the &#34;in a nutshell version&#34;<br /><br />Dont waste your time!!
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you is a very good read. Keeps you turning the pages! Five stars for Sylvia Day! Can't wait for more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it was reedic that people would say that this game sucked. well, that's what I heard. personally it was a.little bit slow but I very quickly became addicted and must play everyday.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so I cant stop playing things they should add are nether portal or make the nether reactors bigger and add armorial which is in the next update but I don't like how in multiplayer it chunck lags alot
0062200909|5.0|Beautiful illustrations. Got this for my husband for Christmas and he LOVES it. I had ordered it before it was available for purchase and it came to my home on the day it was released. If you want to see how they came up with the scenes and miniatures for the movie, this is a great book. Highly recommend.
0937381888|5.0|This book is a must for anyone wanting to craft you own beer no matter if you are new to brewing or a long time home brewer.
0385535147|5.0|For the most part, I enjoy ALL Grisham's works, but the past few works were just slightly below his best work.  However, having just finished reading &#34;The Racketeer&#34; I can say that this book is easily his best work since the &#34;early days&#34; IE: The Firm; The Rainmaker; A Time to Kill, etc.  This book is outstanding in every way Grisham is known for.  The story MOVES its relevant to &#34;today&#34; and it is nonstop page turning interesting - there is absolutely no downtime.  It starts at a high-level and really never dips.  One of his best.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good graphics and the kids love it! Only drawback is you have to be connected to the Internet... Oh well
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very interesting I felt nervous at the end when peeta was acting like katniss didn't like him but she really did like him.
B0025YKDJC|5.0|This is a funny movie and I really enjoyed it..so much that I also bought it on Blu-ray very good movie
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie is on my favs list! I have washed it three times and can't wait to see it again. Such a feel good happy ending that has me dancing and clapping every time. Watch it!!
B0044DEAUA|4.0|very good, product- iam satisfied with the quality. reached in time- perfect packing also. keep up the good work. thanks
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is one of the best books I have ever seen and heard of in my life it is also very funny
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I really liked this app...until I started scoring really high and my kindle fire would crash. I don't know if its my Kindle or the app. but I'm guessing the app because this has never happened until now. just frustrating.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|Probably their best album yet. It's fun yet serious with amazing lyrics and killer beats! If you Love their work you're going to love this album, buy it now!!
B00APUQT7I|4.0|Good movie, but I like the previous one better. I would definitely recommend it. It is a good movie for the whole family.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I just cnt put it down... what story, what plot, n what characters... OMG...<br />Already read 2 times back to back, defenitly one of my fav. read of all times...<br /> i would recommend dis to every one for sure.... 5 freaking stars are just nt enough for dis book..<br />Just go for it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I thought it was a wonderful game. Defiantly better than the first temple run. I would recommend this game to all.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|High School is difficult for many.  It was for me and it was even worst for others.  I was very happy too.  It is amazing how the small actions of one person, or a group, during these school years are enough to mark a person so deeply for better or worst.  I wish I have had the courage to stand up for some of my school mates.  I plan to see the movie so I got the book.  It is good reading.
B00368PSN2|5.0|Very nicely done. I wish the so called dragon had come out in the daylight because I love seeing the threat plainly...not guessing what it is supposed to be.  We do get a better view towards the end of the movie. I recommend this movie whole heartedly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway servers it is awesome I am 13 and I love to play it and it is super fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My sister told me to get the app and I did so when I first started to play I was like wow this game is like amassing.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Never a dull moment and loved the story line too. I love the twist! It was action packed! I can't wait for the next one.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|This book is another brilliant story. Well written,very well researched.<br />Can not reccommend highly enough.<br />For those who love history and brilliant story telling.<br />Enjoy all who read this.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I wanted a calendar app for my new Kindle Fire that would sync with a desktop calendar.<br /><br />CalenGoo filled the bill perfectly.  First, it installed without problems.  I set up a Google Calendar, and linked that Calendar to CalenGoo.  Now I can update my calendar anytime, anywhere.  If I'm using the Kindle, CalenGoo is right there -- I can read my existing commitments, and I can easily add new events.  At the desktop, I usually access the calendar through Thunderbird, but I can also get to the calendar directly through Google sign-in.<br /><br />Everything works seamlessly.  And the visual design of CalenGoo on the Kindle is pleasing, smooth, and easy to learn.
0817439390|5.0|This book really made me a Bryan Peterson fan for life.  Simple but solid.  Really helped me form a solid foundation on Exposure.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is very fun to play and better than Temple Run!!!! I hope all you peeps like it!!!! Some things I don't like it .........But besides that it is SOOO cool!
B00002E23E|5.0|So much was said about it and I wanted some video of Led Zeppelin for my collection.<br />I've enjoyed it so much and watch it over and over.<br />Was so glad that this site had it on stock and I could obtain it so easily.<br />Thanks so much.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I absolutely love this kit.  The moment you take it out of the case, you cant handle this thing without feeling the quality.  The selection of bits is wonderful, and the folks at iFixit have really figured their customers needs out.  Its got bits for everything I possibly could need.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the adapter bit does not stay in its spot very well.  Other than that, this products quality is very high.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|For those of you familiar with the Jungle Book thanks to Disney's classic movie, this book will be interesting. There's a lot that looks familiar, but there's so much more worth the read. So do yourself a favor and read about Mowgli, Baloo, and the crippled tiger Shere Khan.
B009ZFPQOQ|4.0|Freezes a lot, but fun and informative when it works.  When reporting, for a GPS based app, not very intuitive. Overall worth it
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I loved this book!  Great story telling, could not put it down.  One I will definitely read again in the near future!  This would make a great movie.
0240810961|5.0|If I was teaching a class on animation, I would use this set of two books combined with The Animator's Survival Kit. Survival Kit will teach you how to animate sequences and this will teach you how to make your characters come to life.
B00B780TAK|5.0|I agree with a previous review about the first episodes of season 3. It felt repetitive. However, the last 4 episodes more than made up for the lag enough to say I thoroughly enjoyed the entire series. It cannot be true that it is over. The last scene cannot be how it wraps up. Up until that moment, the season finale had a an air of closure to it, feeling neat and tidy. But surely not. Otherwise a well done series I will miss.<br />Added later: There will be a Season 4. Sorry for repeating unverified gossip. [...]
B007TXN4TK|3.0|Slow. Takes a second after you press the key to hear the sound. Would not recommend it to my friends.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I really like this case, it is easy to use and protects the Kindle real well. The only thing missing is a place to store my stylus and a few papers.
B0086700CM|5.0|I pick this game up periodically for some fast paced action. I generally like my games a little less frenetic, but if you want quick thinking, fast swiping, and wild tilting, this is the game. Game is excellently put together. Good game for a party maybe, and just pass it around. I have played this on my Android, but it is far better on my Kindle.<br /><br />Give it a try and start running for your life. Remember that big ball chasing Indiana Jones in the Raiders movie, this is just like that the entire game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and brings out the nurtring side i use to have a horse this is much easier its very realistic
B007WOFXAO|5.0|This is, for the price of one CD (thereabout), the first five album releases from one of the pioneering bands in the California/Country Rock genus which greatly influenced American pop/rock in the early to middle nineteen seventies. There are no studio flubs nor previously unreleased live performances, etc. This is one-stop shopping that gets you five very important recordings from an age when the music (for the most part) was pure and honest, as bands like America enjoyed a freedom to create and express themselves in their own way for a brief interval in rock history. America's first album gives testimony to this claim. The entire album is built upon experimental acoustic rock that didn't really hold much promise of being chart-worthy. I'm sure no record producer in the world would have predicted a song like \\"A Horse With No Name\\" would leap to great heights on the Billboard Top 40, much less that it would leap to the number one spot and attach itself to the pinnacle position for three full weeks. The only real chart potential the album had (looking back, in retrospect, with all things considered) was in the Gerry Beckley should-have-been-number-one-song, \\"I Need You\\". Gerry Beckley told me, in person, that he wrote the song when he was only sixteen years old. (Gerry and Dewey typically hang around after shows to meet with fans - these guys are for real!) I'm not sure that a prettier love ballad has ever been written. I could go on for hours about why this collection is such a gem, but I'll let you take it from here. I already had four of the five CDs (I failed to pick up Hat Trick at any point throughout the passage of many long years), but this five-album set was irresistible! I paid about twenty dollars for something I would have paid much more for! That's the standard, everyday price for this trophy collection (subject to market fluctuations, no doubt)! These are the best works from one of the nineteen seventies' most important and influential bands. And, if I may segue a bit and be so bold, as I will...I just want to make it known that Neil Young WISHES he ever had a voice as beautiful and true as Dewey Bunnell's was - and still is! Let history record my words and know them to be fact! Now, order this set! Do it! Now! Off you go!may segue a bit and be so bold, as I will...I just want to make it known that Neil Young WISHES he ever had a voice as beautiful and true as Dewey Bunnell's was - and still is! Let history record my words and know them to be fact! Now, order this set! Do it! Now! Off you go!
B00B2LRK7W|5.0|LOVE the new Hatebreed! Great workout music! This album is just as good as the rest if not better. Enjoy! :)
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Started a little slow, but after getting into it, couldnt put it down.  Grisham books are fantastic and always get them when they come out.  They never get boring
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is nothing more than a glorified piece of Twilight fanfiction that somehow got published.<br /><br />There is no character development, there is no real plot and what is up with the sex scenes?<br /><br />I first purchased this book in order to find out what all the buzz was about. &#34;Oooh you have to read this book, it's simply AMAZING!!&#34;<br /><br />Well, it's not.<br /><br />We're introduced to the two main characters, Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey (*couBella&Edwardgh*), through an interview that Ana is doing for her best friend. We walk through the stages of Ana's final days at college, and somehow, even though she's self-proclaimed &#34;uncoordinated&#34; and socially awkward, she is able to completely captivate Grey, a multi-millionaire at 27, and - you guessed it - a total sex god.<br /><br />The book goes on about Grey's life beforehand and how he came to be this business tycoon through Ana's and his dates together. Plus, they spontaneously have sex. Every time. And every time, Ana is able to have double digit orgasms throughout the day. &#34;Come.&#34; she orgasms. Grey slaps her ass, she orgasms. It's quite frankly, ridiculous.<br /><br />I realize that this is a work of fiction, and is meant to be read as such. But still, couldn't you have at least put in a small measure of realism? The relationship between Ana and Grey is incredibly shallow. Ana gets abused numerous times in the relationship. Add in the fact that Grey has some kind of domination disorder and you can't help but wonder, &#34;Why in the world is this girl still with this creep?&#34;<br /><br />I'm sorry. Fifty shades of junk.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Excellent and exciting.  Kept you on your toes throufh the whole book. I would reccommend to everyone. The way she planned for so long was exceptional.
B00AKYRCNY|5.0|My 22 month old grandson loves this puzzle app. It gives sound effects for each vehicle keeping him engaged & entertained
B006LSZECO|1.0|Kept reading and reading and hoping something great was coming but not surprised at all and the whole book was very boring for me.  My neighbor encouraged me to read it as she loved it so everyone has different opinions I'm sure but I did not enjoy any part of it.
B0014BEDBG|5.0|this CD keeps me working out harder than ever. I love Justin Timberlake and this DVD is the best ever!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I haven't been hooked on a tv show since Entourage. Got hooked on the show by watching the last couple current episodes. Decided it was the best show on tv right now, and decided to buy the whole 1st season. GREAT decision...starting at the beginning confirmed my thoughts, it IS the best show on tv right now.
B00316DDUE|3.0|Chose this rating as it did not compare to Yanni at the Acropolus.  Music was good and had my guests rocking.
B006YXTRHY|3.0|I'll make this quick. It really doesn't matter if you read reviews or not - you'd probably choose this movie eventually IF you've seen the other parts first. Read the book first!<br />Its a great movie - the characters are portrayed very much like in the book - in spite of the ridicule the main actress receives for her expressionless personality, she portrays Bella well. There are a number of events missing in the movies especially this one that lead to character building, so its important that you do read the books first. None the less its a great series of movies to watch.
B000YEUUCK|4.0|Amazing Blu-Ray.  Showed it at my lucheon and everyone was amazed at the show.  Didn't miss a thing by not being in Vegas.
B00439MV42|4.0|So, I watch it 25 or so years later and we see how far cinema has come. All the weirdness of the 80's comes back to haunt you, but its still a great three part series to watch. Ends well too.
B00992CF6W|4.0|its a good game in all but it is behind the other devices like ios and android and samsung like as though we arent very important.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I had a great time watching the serie<br />Very well done , one of the best ever. The rhythm  is perfect , the acting absolutely credible<br />Top
B005NGKMOU|5.0|I really liked the story and the acting in this western. Probably the best to come along since the Unforgiven.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is amazing, I got it a few days ago and I am addicted!It is amazing how updated it is and you never get bored with it!I love temple run 2 and so will you so get this game now!!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|There's a new gaming mouse in town, the Anker Gaming Mouse! Programmable, precise, and a very fast response (8,000 dpi) are the equal to Logitech. The comfort surpasses Logitech's G500, similar G7 series and definitely the G9, all of these I've owned. Comfort is key for me; a degenerative neuropathy makes using a well designed mouse or keyboard a necessity.<br />Improvements are needed. The manual barely mention how to program mouse buttons or macros.(FYI, assign a key to &#34;macro&#34; to bring up the macro program). With no profile display, opening the mouse program is only way to be certain which of the 2 profiles is active.<br />Would I recommend the Anker mouse? YES, It's a great gaming mouse at a price 1/3 less than Logitech!
B008PZ69T8|4.0|I have never listened to classical music before this it made me appreciate it so much it's so relaxing I love it
B007N31ZBU|1.0|This is not about the movie. It was GREAT. This is about the &#34;book&#34; packaging.<br />The Book is done well, the pictures and information excellent. Then they glued the plastic disc holders on each end. On one end of the beautiful book is a green background with a WHITE THIEF PROTECTION DEVICE under the plastic.  To my knowledge, it cannot be remove without destroying the cover. Had to send it back. Someday they will wake up.  .
1466401885|5.0|Can't wait for walking disaster. Jamie McGuire right writes amazing Jamie McGuire writes amazing books check out the Providence trilogy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This one sucked me in...a real page turner. I've recommended it to many friends and gifted to various family. I can't wait for the movie- Ridley-Scott bought the Director rights to produce.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book has everything I liked. mystery, suspense, good and evil characters, romance and a surprise ending. I would like to have a sequel.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|Such a beautiful story! It warms my heart and brings tears to my eyes. My kids like it just as much.
B0086449YA|5.0|As always, Mark Knopfler's songs are melodic and set a unique story. It dawned on me that each of his songs is like a very good short story you can &#34;see&#34; and hear. &#34;Privateering&#34; is one of his best, offering great variety and &#34;stories&#34; that move you.
B0092W2GSG|5.0|This band continually grows and this album demonstrates their range of song writing and musicianship.  They easily move between folk, jazz, and Latin influences to create a truly unique sound.
0205313426|5.0|This is the best resource.  We buy one for each student.  High school and college and anyone with a job will use it regularly to check on how to say or write something.  Easy to use.  The best guide.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another good one by Nicholas Sparks!<br />Pretty predictable, as usual, but I still can't wait to see the movie on Valentine's Day! ;-)
B009UWYFFK|5.0|When I saw previews for this in the theater I thought it was going to be stupid, but I ended up really liking it and would recommend it.
B001HN694K|5.0|great just what they said it was  movie didnt skip stick like new out of the package at a store and it was used
B0010X8NF0|2.0|My husband and I could only deal with about 1/2 hour of this movie.  I don't understand why others rated it  so hight and as one of the funniest movies of the year (2007 I believe).  Slow starting and never really gained any momentum when we were watching it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was very detailed,but I love this book and all the other ones. It was an absolutely amazing , fantastic book
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like this game just not face book! it would be much better without the whole face book thing on my kindle. I don't have a face book nor want 1.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It can be a little glitchy but other than that it is soooooooo fun!!!!<br /><br />And free!!!!!!<br />Plus u don't have to buy a bunch of in app stuff to beat it like in other free apps
B00280LYIM|5.0|FOR ALL READERS READ THIS BEFORE BUYING! This book is amazing. The book finally brings an end to so many mysteries and leaves you with more. The Pan mystery is solved, the mystery on Luke's next move and the mystery of the title. This book finally brings an end to the mystery of Rick's writing.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|Delirium was a very well written and great book. It keeps you guessing till the end. And it was a great love story.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game was way better then I expected it makes you think which I love games that actually require somewhat of an IQ not dissing on other games just happy. to see a game that requires a brain.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|The second book was way better than the first. I kept on wondering what was going to happen next and although some parts were slow. It was a great book
B001UV4XIS|5.0|very happy with the product this is the most perfect way to purchase products.I would recommend anyone to get great product at very good pricing.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I bought this video for my grand daughter and she loves it. When she visits she wants to watch it.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|very happy with the product this is the most perfect way to purchase products.I would recommend anyone to get great product at very good pricing.
B000VIK8D0|3.0|If you read any of the well written books about the life of Wyatt Earp, you'll find that this movie is more spot-on that Tombstone, though Tombstone is a much more frolicking, fun, witty, Hollywood-flair version. Both movies came out at the same time so it's hard not to compare them! But this movie is about Wyatt Earp, the man, and he is well portrayed by Kevin Costner, according to biographies. Earp was quiet, effective, reticent, bold. It's a long movie, meanders sometimes, but overall a good historical biography of one of America's most legendary men of the West.
B002XDFOGM|4.0|I'm no classical music expert by any means. I still have a pair of ears that tire of the electronic beat pulse of our times. This collection is fresh, vibrant, lively, and concise. The dynamics are not overblown up like many \\"modern\\" recordings. Gentle depth here. Worth a listen, and if you can get a real cd well worth it.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good story line. Mini games are good. Wish it was longer. Good graphics also. Would recommend for someone who like these types of games.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I thought it was longer than the one that came with my Kindle...but it is nice to have an extra cable. Would recommend it to others as a great way to have an extra on hand.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Good timing, some interesting technical details of the military and spy world but quite repetitive and weak in the story line. Characters are very shallow and way too black and white.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A great game to play as you wait for appoints and just to have fun. Takes learning  to a new level
B0044DEAUA|4.0|I was looking for a speakerphone to enhance the quality of audio from my iPhone 4S when used at home with my wife. Bought the SuperTooth Buddy as an affordable alternative to $100 devices that may also have worked. Very loud and easy to use. Haven't even tried it in my car yet but am very happy with the device used at home. One drawback, although not major--it does not play audio from iTunes or streaming radio stations. Perhaps that's not the case with other mobile phones, but with the iPhone 4S it's definitely the case. Setup was simple and controls are very straightforward. In the week I've had it, with the exception of not playing other audio, I've been very happy with it.
B008K8H9C6|3.0|I got this game for my 6 year old son, well, its okay, but it is not 'wheres my water' or 'wheres my perry'.  I got it because it was in the category of those two games, but it didn't hold my sons attn as those did.
B000I3R796|2.0|Aeon Flux doesn't have a bad story. It also has good actors, especially Charlize Theron, of course. But every good scene of the film is being killed a few moments later, with a ridiculous action scene or, even worse, a stupid comment. With a little bit more logic (okay, a lot more logic) and some optimization of the story line, this could have become a nice flick, indeed.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved this book. He is lucky to be alive but then maybe that was God's intention so he could tell his story.<br />I have always believed in reincarnation and many writers out there prove it.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love all Michael Connelly books. The reason why I would give four instead of five stars is because I found it a little boring with all of the statistics relating to the Los Angeles riots. Michael does a wonderful job with his research but this time I found myself skipping several paragraphs of facts and figures anxious to get into the heart of the story.

B0030BCCB6|5.0|great early fleetwood mac reissues, sound quality is superior to regular cd releases, which usually sound like a speaker covered in mud
B009FZFONO|5.0|One of the best shows I have viewed in a long time. Great story line and some what original writing.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|I found the game to be fun to play and Friendly to follow. It has a few flaws that have already been stated in other reviews.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|What more is there to say?  They are hot and they kill monsters.  They are absolutely the best!  Love it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is overall a pretty awesome game I love it however for some reason I can't install the new update that has been made available to androids Google play store I'm not sure why this has happened but have sent a message to customer service to find out what the problem is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love the game I play it all the time, can't stop playing it. Like how i can compete with my friends on facebook also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game rocks!it not only teaches you how to care for  a horse but you'll have fun while doing it
B002APU580|1.0|Painful!  I enjoyed the book and the BBC version, so I assumed this adaptation would be tolerable.  Don't waste your time on this crap.
B001F6TXME|5.0|A perfect picture is worth a thousand words !<br /> Perfect for wildlife and nature shots to reduce camera shaking that can distort images . :-)
B007EECSFA|4.0|I have read  many Kate Morton books, but I have to admit that this is probably my favorite. A definite &#34;Read it!&#34; recommendation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is played by almost everyone in our family -- from grandma to kids to grandkids (ages 9 to 61).  We visit each other's world, help each other with construction, and generally have great fun being creative.
B0086700CM|4.0|its nice to play when you want to put down your violent games.don't get all down and say its just some Disney price of crud. it takes a while to get the stuff you want in the credit store but that's the challenge. get it now!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesomely off the rocker crazy fun. I play nonstop all the time we ninjas humanly awesome coolness broadcasted.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|It was difficult to read. I wanted to shake her. It is hard to imagine anyone that deprived of learning any right and wrong.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Wes, Jeremiah and Neyla deliver on a sound that I can't get enough of lately: this &#34;modern&#34; Americana folk.  There's something special about the dynamic this trio creates when they come together.  The lyrics really paint a picture; coupled with the raw gruff tambre in Wes's voice, to the layered harmonies from backing vocals by Jeremiah and Neyla, stitched together with Neyla's fantastic classical cello arrangements: the Lumineers deliver both a raw and personal sound while keeping it full and rich all at once.  This first album is truly album and I, given what I've heard already, their next album will further prove that they're here to stay.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It gave an insider guide into life as a SEAL and the raid to get bin Laden. Fascinating book. A recommended read.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I don't know what Tegan and Sara have done to provoke such unexpected reactions in me, but I get goosebumps and occasionally feel overwhelmed to the point of tears while listening to this album.  Now is exactly the right time for this kind of sound, and I hope it brings them massive success.  Bravo, ladies!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I had to call and request  that we be sent a new DVD, when I purchased the movie it stated new and when my husband went to download on his nook the security code was already used. Customer service was very understanding and sent a new DVD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. it helped fill the time and the graphics were quite good as well. my sister liked it as well.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|Because I had never seen this film and it was time. And let me tell you, that was the most worthwhile use of $1.99<br />Everyone who is of an appropriate age should see this movie. It's a spectacular, deeply moving film. I loved it. Bravo, Darren Aronofsky.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a Young Adult. Not even a young-ish adult. I fall in with the older crowd. Back when the Harry Potter novels and movies became so popular, I decided to give the books a try. I couldn't get past page 3 of the first book, any of the half dozen or so times that I tried reading it. So, when The Hunger Games became popular, I ignored it as something similar. But then the movie was on TV, so I watched it, and really enjoyed it. I hate cliffhanger endings, and so I had to go and give the book a try, just to see what happened next. I'm very glad that I did!<br /><br />The trilogy is written in a way that is appealing to all ages. There is some violence, of course, so it is not appropriate for the under 12-14 crowd, but it's also not so graphic as to be a turn off to the older group. The story focuses on a teenage girl, and the oppression and injustice that she is faced with in her world. The topic itself is what makes it appealing to all ages. Anyone would commiserate with Katniss' plight as she struggles throughout the book.<br /><br />I will not go into detail about the content, I am sure it has been more than covered in all the other reviews! Just wanted to add my point of view as an \\"adult.\\" Highly recommended book from Ms. Collins, as are the other two in the Trilogy!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! Its got everything: romance; action; danger; mystery! Oh and don't forget the zombies! The only thing I wish could be different is for the price to be a little less per episode or a better package deal.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I got killed by a zombie and it deleted one of my worlds which had so much stuff. Why did it happen?
1451695187|5.0|Non-fiction at its best. I highly recommend this book to everyone! It is an amazing story and extremely thought-provoking. Don't judge the writer until you've read his story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the new temple run! I like all the new obsticals! challengeing but still really fun and interesting! I would Defnitaly recommend it!
B002BWP49C|5.0|As is typical, the books are better than the films, so read the books first and then dive into the movies.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Have been using for a while. Have found it to be the best  tool that I have to monitor my network. Use it to identify mac addresses of devices connected thus allowing me to manage them better.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|As is typical, the books are better than the films, so read the books first and then dive into the movies.
B008CJ0KI8|2.0|I saw all the positive reviews for this cd so I figured it must be pretty good.  I have attempted to listen to this cd 3 times now, and I just can't get through the whole thing without skipping past most of the songs or just turning it off altogether.  I'm sorry, but I really don't get what all the hype is about, and quite honestly I find the cd pretty much impossible to listen to.  At best this cd would be background music at a party or gathering where people aren't really paying attention to the music.<br /><br />I haven't listened to a cd this bad in a long time.  I agree with one of the other reviewers who stated that just because an artist is \\"different\\" doesn't mean he's any good, and that pretty much sums up my experience with this cd.  It almost feels like the artist is just wondering around aimlessly with no real sense of direction for his music.  Production is just like a hodge podge of music put together.  I want to give this one star, but I'll give it an additional star solely because I know people have different musical tastes but this is just not my cup of tea.
B002ADYFJC|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this book, if you like fantasy, King Arthur and the like, you will love this book. If you get it though, do not forget to get the prequel &#34;The Forest House&#34;
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's fun, but a lot harder and confusing. I didn't know quite what to do when I came to this one part that wasn't in the tutorial.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Growing up, I had always loved playing this game in person.  Now it's so easy to play multiple games at a time with your friends; whenever it is convenient for you to take your turn.
1616550414|5.0|This is an amazing book and is full of information you can't really find on the internet, at least you can't find it and be 100% sure it's true. I've been an avid Zelda fan my entire life and even I didn't know some of the information that was in here. It even has art and explanations of characters that didn't even make it into some of the games. It is extremely thorough when it comes to Hyrule's history, as the name suggests, but it was even better then I thought it was going to be.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|I purchased this for one of my kids' stockings at Christmas. With the way they treat their DVD's I was excited to see that the price was only $3.99 when I purchased this movie. My kids love it and it arrived super fast.
0984183523|5.0|I am a leading MBA admissions consultant (VincePrep). Even though I am not trying to join a management consulting firm, I found Victor's book to be a priceless resource in my consulting practice for two reasons. First, he helped me understand the consulting industry (Why do companies hire consulting firms? Why do consulting firms hire some candidates, and not others?). Second, and more importantly, he gave me the tools to clarify the assumptions I make every day.<br /><br />It was introduced by a former client, who recently joined McKinsey. From 2013, Victor's book will be required reading for my MBA admissions counseling clients, especially those looking to join consulting firms post-MBA.<br /><br />Whatever your industry sector or future career plans, I recommend \\"Case Interview Secrets\\" as a useful toolbox that can help you persuade others to support your ideas.<br /><br />Thank you, Victor!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my son's stocking at Christmas. I couldn't pass up the $3.99 price it was at the time. Great movie too!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing. The ending makes me want to start to read the next book. So exciting and gripping I did not want to stop reading. LOVED IT!
B003YNFYCO|5.0|I love this CD.  What fond memories.  Now that I hear this - I realize how much the Beatles borrowed from others,  Little Richard, among others.  Great music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book seems to be good for all ages. My grandma actually recommended it and she was right... Suzanne Collins has a way of making u unsure of who u like more in the love triangle.
B000UJ48WC|5.0|If you like scary movies this is the one to own.  Every time I see I still jump out of my skin even though I know what is going to happen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun. when my son comes home from school he go's right to subway surfers. My son loves this game
0783226888|5.0|We have watched this movie several times on the TV and found it very good.  We decided we wanted to have a copy of our own.
1594744769|4.0|I am a teacher and I am considering doing this book with a small group of grade 8 girls (13 years old) in my special education class. They are into mystery/paranormal/thriller type of things. Do you think this book's language or content is inappopriate for this age level? I'm not so worried about how sophisticated the writing is because I will work through it with them.  I am more concerned with whether or not there is a lot of swearing, sexual content, violence, etc., or whether it would be too \\"scary\\" for them.  Thanks!<br />(P.S. I know it's not fair to give it a 4-star rating when I haven't read it, but I had to give it a rating.  Since the average is 4-stars for this book, that's what I chose!)
B00005RDRO|3.0|This is just any OK movie.  Some of the scenes are funny but other seem to lack.  Thought the best character was Alec Guinness and the most annoying Peter Falk.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|when I got this app I loved it and then when I tryed to go back on again it wouldn't let me.was amazing,now it sucks
B002UD56I6|5.0|This is perhaps one of the very best videos of Michael Jackson.  Not only does it show what a great talents he was, but it also shows him as an exceptionally sensetive human being.  He is greatly missed.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|My daughter uses this app on all her android devices. I like how it works. Gives great detail of the products usage.
B001P829VY|5.0|This is truly a classic Bogart movie.  One everyone should have in their collectioin if you are a Humphrey Bogart fan.
B0086700CM|4.0|Every run makes you wanting more and more. Love the graphics, love the fun and its VERY VERY ADDICTIVE. THANK U FOR THE FUN
B00APUYN0I|5.0|My 19 year old son rented this movie to watch with his girlfriend.  He said I should watch it, but I wasn't quite interested in watching a \\"teen\\" movie (I'm 40 years old).  I had some time so I decided to watch it, and really enjoyed it.  Granted many of the songs are 80s songs so that greatly appealed to me, but the story was also quite cute and enjoyable.  There were some gross stupid jokes moments (like when Fat Amy gets a drink thrown at her) that I didn't care much for, and some of the acting was a bit over the top, but ultimately I enjoyed it and even found myself singing along to many of the songs and rooting for the Barden Bellas.  The ending was predictable, but it's a teen movie so I expected that.  It was a good rental and a good way to spend the afternoon, even for an adult.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Most part two products usually aren't better. This app is most appreciated. The graphics are phenomenal. I love the levels. Thanx for making part two just as ADDICTIVE
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I don't have enough words to describe how great this movie is. It is easily the best comedy in years.
B002361MLA|1.0|I purchased this book halfway through reading Dave Ursillo's sycophantic ode to Tolle in &#34;Lead Without Followers.&#34; If THAT awful book was any indication on how dreadful Tolle's book would be, I missed it... and regrettably suffered about halfway through this so-called extraordinary book before I wised up and just stopped reading. Hey, I've suffered through depression too, but I didn't come out the other side a condescending D-bag. Just another reason everyone needs to stop reading self-help books and simply work on getting your own head out of your butt!
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is full of great explanations, well-cited research, and written well enough to understand even if you've never taken a statistics course. If you want to be healthier, this is a must-read and must-follow!
B0086700CM|4.0|Sometimes this game just freezes up when you almost get your high score... Please fix this. this gets very frustrating...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketter<br /><br />Best John Grisham book ever!! Loved it, full of suspense and unpredictiable.  Thrilling to the end.  Need more authors like John Grisham - never a disappointment.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|On your old one Imangi Studios I said there was lag! This new one is cool and all but way too much lag! Fix this in the next update please! This is really annoying. Other than that it was OK...
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Amazing combination of origional writing, great story and awesome acting.<br />I have given this movie to more friends than any other.<br />And, there are witches,.... And good guys, and really bad guys. and.....<br />See it
B006RUJST6|5.0|Wow.  Completely inthralled.  And the second book is even better.  You will not regret reading this book.  I cried and a lot and laughed a lot and just couldn't stop.
B005HSL626|5.0|Love this game and passes the time with a slice of fruit and a flick of the finger. Gotta love it!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|Hot and sect and steamy!!  The story line is a good one too.  It makes you feel sympathy and compassion and keeps you wondering if some one this hot could really exist.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game, however, for some reason it won't stay on my kindle.  I have had to install it several times and each time I have to start all over again.  I'll give it one more chance, just in case it is something that i'm doing, but if it disappears again, good riddence.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Addicting logic puzzles.the only thing that i wish it did was show to scores so that you can try to to improve your score numerically.
6300248550|5.0|This one is the best of all the Jane Eyre movies, in my humble opinion. Can't beat Timothy Dalton! Love it!
B00A3YTC6Q|3.0|I enjoyed this movie, but it was quite predictable.  I love Miami and enjoyed seeing places I'd been to.  My son liked it for the music and the dancing.  There are many curvy, beautiful girls (just like the real Miami) and some hypersexualized dancing scenes.  But there isn't any sex.  If the kids are young and you don't want to expose them to a lot of skin and \\"booty gyrations\\" then don't watch it, but if you aren't bothered by that, it's a cute little show.  Not gonna win any Oscars.
B000065V41|5.0|One of my MUST WATCH Christmas movies EVERY year. I *LOVE* this version and Michael Caine did a great job.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I enjoy using this app.  I can Facebook without having to carry my laptop around.  I can just put my kindle in my purse and use it wherever I go in my day to keep up with my friends.  Yea!
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Love Andrea Bocelli's voice and paired with David Foster, I really like his arrangements. Love the song done with the Muppets too! But boy....Andrea is a gem! And I don't know anybody that can hold a note like he does...and you almost never hear him do an inhale. He is just so gifted. This was a good ol fashioned Christmas program. Thank you, Andrea and David. Job well done!
B0086700CM|5.0|Okay, I don't play this game, but my son steals my kindle and plays this game whenever he has a chance.  He enjoys the game, the sounds it makes, and there are times I have to say &#34;That's enough.  Step away from my kindle.  Now.&#34; to get him to stop.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is very addicting.  Shoot at like-colored balls to make them disappear.  A person can play for hours on the same game, increasing the levels successfully cleared.  I have gotten to 112 one time and 113 another.  Then you either start running out of balls, or make a stupid move and not allow your ball to escape the red line at the bottom.  Of all the bubble games, I find this one in a league of its own and enjoy it very much.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game had great mystery and enjoyment had me playing it forever non stop .The way the design and animation was done perfectly which reeled me in to the end.With the different chapters were different and amazing that I wanted to play the game more times.The challenges were great taught me about strategy which I didn't know how to do before everyone should download this.Buy version because it's worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game!!!!! It's the best game I have ever played. I think other should play it to. Love it!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is wonderful! One minute you hate a character and four episodes later you are changing your mind. If you love period films, get this series!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|My grandson loves this game!  He tried a more expensive version & was really disapointed. But he says this one is great.  Creepy like it's suppose to be :)
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Incredibly written to hold the readers attention in high anticipation for the next page!  I truly could see the<br />Whole story unfolding before my minds eye!  I look forward to seeing the movie and compare my vision<br />of the events and characters.  Truely an unparalleled adventure of the human spirit triumphant!
0689829590|5.0|After watching the video again and again with my twin grandsons, age 2, I thought they might enjoy the book version. They are crazy about the MOON, and they love this story! Needs SUPERVISION because there are paper fold outs that show how big the ladder was, how big the moon was, etc. The rest is board book. The boys really love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|You must get this game. It is AMAZING!!!!!!! I love it and all the new features. I think the best part is the new mines
1564029654|5.0|The book has such well-done pictures, but it is also the theme of the book that causes my twin grandson, age 2, to request this book again and again. Somthing about the littlest baby owl wanting his Mommy to come back, and then she DOES, really makes him happy! I bought my twin grandsons about 15 books for Christmas, and I would have to say that this is their FAVORITE, and that is up against some very strong contenders!!! Great book!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids have me hooked! Its 6:16 am and I'm playing before waking the kids up for school. Very creative the graphics are awesome and you dont have to spend real money. I love the pace. The dog stays right on your heals. The trains just keep coming. Will be tough for competition to out do this game. Cant wait til they come up with another game.<br /><br />Kitten<br />Douglasville Ga
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show and have really enjoyed the CD.  Can't wait for the next one and I hope is has &#34;Fade Into You&#34;. Go Nashville!
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great on the kindle but u can't update it! The 0.6.0 update for pocket edition just came o it and said It is all so an update on the kindle but how do you update it is my question?
0307730697|3.0|Fearless is the story of Adam Brown and his journey from rock bottom to a navy seal.  Honestly this book was hard for me to get through. I had read all of the reviews and was really excited to read this book, but it never grabbed my interest. I was a little surprised with the language in the book published by Waterbrook, but do realize that this how things were during this time. This book is an incredible story about a true hero and man of God, but it wasn't what I was expecting.<br /><br />(I received Fearless from Waterbrook in return for a review. The opinions expressed are mine alone.)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing! I a literally addicted to it. I can't put it down. I play it everyday!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I have used this app for a few years.  Both on Android phones and now on the kindle hd.  Makes getting your listings online a breeze.  Scan the barcodes, take pictures, and check the status of your auctions on the go.  A must have if you are a serious ebay user.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book numerous times ans still feel the same each time I read it. I love Abby and Travis!
B0018CENUC|5.0|If you like Toby, this is one fantastic album.  Love his style and his independence.  The fact that he is a great supporter of our servicemen and women is a big plus in my book.  Buy this album, slip on the headphones, all enjoy some great music.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is amazing! Like watching a mini movie each episode! Love love love it!!!!! Even if you are not a comic book fan you will like this series!
B0042GIRYE|5.0|Great price for an album of some great songs.  Zac Brown Band's unique sound is delivered on every song.  Really enjoy playing this album, over and over.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|I bought this for my MacBook Air & you just plug it in and it works. Seems pricey but is worth it for what it does.
B0040GYAOM|4.0|My wife loves Elvis, so this was a great way to stay out of the dog house.  I was disappointed it did not have Blue Suede Shoes, but other than that, this is one great album Elvis fans.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Classic Grisham. I got lost in the pages and couldn't put it down! One of the best he's written since pelican brief. Kudos John
0399160450|4.0|Like most of T. C.'s books - plot is very pertinent to current happenings.  The sub- author is really catching on the style of Clancy and I am really enjoying the book - about 120 pages left.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|YES, get it!! Handy little app to check your listings, search for items, bid and win...loving ebay! This is a fun one!!
B002WY65W4|4.0|Some of my family hadn't seen this movie and with the zombie craze really ramping up I wanted to have them see the best acted and technically produced zombie movie.  They loved it though one of the family is concerned that there are no more twinkies.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun<br />this app has good graphics,  simple yet fun.  this app is easy to use.  it is free and I can play with my friends.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Adds a whole new dimension to all of your favorite storybook characters, I love it, and I bet you will too!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Bought it one night when I couldn't sleep, 3 hours later, I was done! I really enjoyed it! I love a book that will quickly bring you in and make you feel as if you are the main character.
B002VECM6S|5.0|The whole family can watch this. There are good lessons in it for adults, children and anyone who cares about fair play.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|I am happy to support Susan Boyle's storybook climb to fame, and this album includes some really beautiful songs. There are one or two that will not make it onto my iPod but that leaves a good percentage that will.She does a really nice job with &#34;Memories&#34;.
0316224588|4.0|There's something about a guy like Rebus, who is so set in his ways, that is like a breath of fresh air. He's a no nonsense sort of cop who is going to get to the bottom of a case whether his superiors like it or not. What I found most satisfying in seeing Malcolm Fox, the sniveling whinging sack of dull, put in his place. Enjoyable story with an enjoyable main character. . .Though there was something about the copy editing, holy cow! Who let this go to print with all the errors? Maybe if American editors weren't so keen to take this series and dumb down the dialogue to suit Americans who refuse to learn a little slang from across the pond, there wouldn't be so many odd errors in Rankin's books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing writing it definitely keeps me wanting more. I can't wait to finish the third book then watch the movies.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This is the fouth Ice Age movie and one of the best. The action is almost non-stop. The characters have great interactions with each other while providing a moving story line and robust humor. Its a great movie for all ages!
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I really like non linear story lines, and I feel this movie executed that really well. Also, it's pretty funny.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|This movie was a blast to watch.  Not what I expected, course I really didn't have much of an idea what to expect, going in.<br />Very suspenseful, and you REALLY connect with Sam Rockwell's character through the course of the movie.  Very well shot and well-written.
B008DYZKQE|5.0|This is a great alternative to a normal fairy tale. I read it to my four year old son and he loves it. :-)
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really loved this book, it was a page turner right from the first page to the last. When it finished I spent the next week continually thinking of the book and how much I related to Laurie, how betrayed she felt to find out the man she was married to was not authentic. The difficulty of losing a child ... so amazing, a must read.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Excellent book for people wanting to know more about the Halo world. I am excited and can't wait to read the next in the series.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|I vastly prefer a good slasher or horror film any given day of the week, but this movie made me laugh out loud and that never happens. I honestly don't care what rotten tomatoes or metacritic have to say about this movie, its fantastic.
0062082353|5.0|Iv read many sniper books and this one def ranks up there with the best. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good war story.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|After level 12 you can't see the whole board anymore. I uninstalled it and it happened again. It was fun until then. Waste of time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it, the graphics are amazing and there is a new area I wish I could tell you but you're gonna have to play to find out.So get it this game is amazing
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the book! Had a hard time putting it down. Definitely would recommend it! I love their story! It was so passionate one minute and tension filled the next!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read, I know that most don't include a dictionary as a book but I do I reviewed this book to show how much it helps people. I thank the editors and junior editors for making this book alive for me and many others too read
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Many reviewers stated that this mouse is very light weight. It is heavier than the Razer Abyssus I had been using. The user interface downloads with the driver and is an absolute no-brainer<br />to learn to use. One very strong point with this mouse is that it never fails to click or double click. My Razer mouse was forever missing a click, a needless annoyance. I hold it with the<br />tip of my thumb and the tips of the ring and pinkie with ease, even though it is maybe 50% larger than the Abyssus. I have never tripped the side buttons with my thumb and I can reach the<br />forward most button in front of the wheel without effort.<br />  This is my 1st programmable mouse and I am very happy with it, every keyboard stroke I have assigned to a button has worked without fail.<br />  The wheel is light weight, but it works perfectly and does not seem likely that it will \\"develop a mind of it's own\\".<br />  The cord is top notch, it's not going to fray or end up in knots.<br />  I've been using this mouse daily for a month now and I have no regrets and not even one nit to pick.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This book helps you understand many different words, being a inspired writer it truly helps a lot I really recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much! It was not one that I could not put down but it had a good ending and I am looking forward to seeing the movie!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This case was just what I was looking for. The color is perfect. It is solid quality and stands without slipping.
B00B1OEEB0|5.0|I've been a fan of both Binki and Adam for a while, so I had high hopes for this album. I was not disappointed. The songs are beautifully crafted and sung, and their voices go together so well. Best album of the year so far (they even beat out Local Natives). I hope to hear more from these two very talented musicians soon!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love this game a lot of fun and haven't run into any issues. It's a lot arcade games but this one works better. . It's easier to get the coins to fall. It's fun and exciting to win the prizes and unlock the puzzle pieces
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It made me buy something I didn't want imangi u r total idiots morons and idiots. Worst game producer ever
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best British costume dramas ever! The acting is great and the story twists and turns quickly. The costumes of the era are almost as fabulous as the story itself. It is partially filmed at the actual Highclere Castle, which can be visited if you find yourself near London.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Have a great time with the different modes finding the objects, sometimes the description doesn't make sense. But other than that very fun to play.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|The folk music of the early sixties spoke to the open young minds that believed it was time to move on from the ineffective political cold war strategies of their parents. From women's rights, to constitutionally guaranteed rights of equality to African American's, to investing the lives of our children to fight war's that we failed to understand, and refused to come to terms with the impossibility of winning. All this factual history took place between 1960 and into the early 70's. BUT, the poetry of acoustic  folk music evolved into Rock & Roll but tied more to Rhythm & Blues. This was evident in the historical entrance of Dylan at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival backed up by The Paul Butterfield Blues Band. The album &#34;Highway 61&#34; changed Rock & Roll forever. Enter The Beatles, The Stones, The Doors, Jimmy Hendrix and we just about reach the Summer of Love in 1969 at Woodstock. So why, would the American youth fail to embrace &#34;Cold Fact?&#34; Perhaps because what was immediately relevant to Rodriguez at the time in Detroit, was already sung and said by Dylan, Baez, Ochs and more prior to 1965.<br />  What happened in South Africa was addressed at the earliest possible time, but 5-8 years after the cries and demands for equality of Life in the U.S. lead to anthem like songs such as &#34;The Times they are a changin ...&#34; The film, like a &#34;time delayed echo&#34; of the problems in the U.S. was now fueling the frustrations of the dissolutioned youth of South African. Although there are some very interesting similarities in Dylan's lyrics and music. Primarily from &#34;Freewheelin&#34; (1963) through  &#34;Bringing it all back home&#34; (1965). But the music of America & England had moved on by 1968. So it was no longer immediately relevant to the drug induced lyrics & beat that helped that generation work through it's alienation & pain. Suddenly, what might appear no longer new and relevant in the States, is revolution to the ears & lights fires inthe hearts of the youthful movements that helped change the moral compass of a backward country, half way around the world.<br />  Like Pilgrims and so called Prophets before him, Rodriguez helped change the lives of a Nation. Not only did he have wonderful songs to hear, but thankfully he touched the hearts of many and changed there lives forever... This movie is a gift! Treat yourself and your friends to it...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book nearly made me cry, or at times BURST with laughter or joy. 4 words: I LOVE THIS BOOK.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Still unable to take pics really disappointed with this product.  I feel the description was misleading and the product is not satisfactory.
B000002O4X|5.0|Composed beautifully.<br />The cinema photography in this movie was so awesome and the music really took you there.<br />Even though it had award winning actors, the compositions really allowed you to feel their emotions.<br />One of the best movies ever.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|This is pure rock that makes you feel good.<br />I can't get enough of this music.<br />I play it many times a day.<br /><br />And buying it on Amazon has a plus: it costs less that on iTunes!
B008MEM24S|5.0|He watches &#34;Phineas & Ferb&#34; and was thrilled when I showed him there was a game with 'Perry/Agent P' as a character.  Gameplay has been easy enough to get him involved and challenging enough to keep him after it for a few weeks now (he is 4!), but other than the introduction of new games on my phone, Where's My Perry still captivates him.<br /><br />What else is there to say? Oh, I think it's fun, too.
0545265355|5.0|I chose this rating because like everyone else, so it seems, I couldn't put it down.  I did find the book very oppressive and I was frustrated and emotional for the characters.  I thought the content was very imaginative and creative, and thankfully, there was somewhat of an upbeat ending. This was quite the trilogy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|u must get this app it has no glitches or shutdowns the game is tricky and surprising in a lot of ways
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love the book and I always enjoy ordering through Amazon.  Received the order very quickly and book in excellent condition.  Great to order through Amazon instead of going to book store
B004GYY714|1.0|None of the apps I've downloaded have helped me do what I want to do with my Kindle Fire HD & I've come to believe that the whole problem is with the Kindle itself.  Am not happy with the &#34;wanna' be&#34; IPad my son lovingly strained his budget to purchase for me.  Sadly, it was a total waste of his hard earned money for MY purposes.  I feel guilty for wanting to trade or sell it & angry because he spent over $200 for the stupid thing & Amazon will give me $65 for it.  What a rip off.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the book and I always enjoy ordering through Amazon.  Received the order very quickly and book in excellent condition.  Great to order through Amazon instead of going to book store
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Because it doesn't help me do what I want to do with my Kindle Fire HD.  Nothing I've tried on the Kindle has helped.  I need Adobe flashplayer & this &#34;wanna be&#34; IPad Kindle doesn't support it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book and I always enjoy ordering through Amazon.  Received the order very quickly and book in excellent condition.  Great to order through Amazon instead of going to book store
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|So long as you don't think too much about the &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34; of time travel it was entertaining.  Not sure I'd watch it again though.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Just a very cute movie based on one of Roald Dahl's books.  My husband and I love it and wanted to watch it without commercial interruption, so we purchased it.  Whether you are five or 105, the kid in you will be entertained!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|okay the game is amazing but I'm disappointed when I try to start it up 5 times in a row and it crashes everytime. overall when I can get it up its a fun game but the crashed might need to be checked
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I loved this game.  I can't wait to see the sequel! The graphics were beautiful and there was great story.  Highly recommend.
B000059XUI|5.0|NOW I THOUGHT GENE HACKMAN AS LEX LUTHOR WAS THE BEST SUPERMAN VILLAIN IN CINEMA UNTIL I SAW THIS VERY GOOD SEQUEL. TERRENCE STAMP AS GENERAL ZOD JUST BLEW ME AWAY, ESPECIALLY HOW HE TALKED AND JUST TOOK THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE PLANET. SERIOUSLY HE SHOULD'VE GOTTEN NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR IN HIS PERFORMANCE.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Great job from all the actors. The movie has almost everything: it's funny, witty, action, drama. The crew is more cohesive in this second part too and the movie benefits from it enormously. And this second part is as good as the first. Once you start watching, you can't pause until it's finished!
B000059Z8J|5.0|First of all let me say this Christopher Reeve to this day was and still is Superman/Clark Kent. I mean it was like he was born to play that role, thank Mr. Reeve  for giving us a perfect performance. Margaret Kidder as well as Lois Lane and honestly she was actually pretty hot as Lois Lane back in the day. Finally Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and Marlon Brando as Jor-El; are just perfect. From a great villain to a great father, I also enjoyed the symbolism in the movie. Superman as a Jesus Christ figure being sent to Earth just blew my mind away. Honestly Christopher Reeve should've at the very least gotten an oscar nomination in his performance, Margaret Kidder as well.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was a great short story.  I thought it was a very original idea and I with I would have read it when I was younger.  I can't wait till my son is a little older so that he can read it.  The book does jump forward in time to cover a few years but I think it is well done and if you are paying attention it is easy to follow.  I would just stick with the book in the &#34;ender quintet&#34; I have read that next several books in the series and was not impressed so just stick with enders game you will not be disappointed.
0061906220|5.0|My class could not get enough of this series of books.  They would ask to listen to them over and over.  Great to get children interested in books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I hate to wait and this game is perfect for filling time. very easy but challenging for on the go or in leisure time
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|This is a beautiful album of romantic music sung by a Master. The songs are beautifully sung by Andrea Bocelli.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I read most of the A. C. Doyle stories when I was a teenager which was many years ago.  When television came along, I was enthralled with the movie versions and watched them over and over.  It is a joy to read this book, especially on my Kindle since arthritis does not allow me to hold a heavy book.  I enjoy the language usage to describe the scenes, plots and characters.  This is my first Kindle purchase, the first of many Amazon book purchases.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get the update they already have it for ipod when will they get it for kindle fire and I need to play with my friends
B005GIS1WA|5.0|I bought this for my son but I think all adults enjoyed it as well. Good movie and a great story
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good but could use some work on the car part of the game and the yarn game difficult to figure out at first
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is awesome because it has better graghics and there are lots of different things and it is really fun and I recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I like the characters and the setting. Shows the relationship between the help and the family. The history is interesting. Downton Abby, Season 2
0393317552|4.0|A mind-expanding book for me. On a subject which I didn't know much about when the book first came out. And while I no longer agree with everything Diamond says, his ideas are wonderfully stimulating. Highly recommended.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Mystery with brains and beauty! Guaranteed to be a family favorite. We've watched several times and enjoy it as much as the first time.
B004SKJTY6|4.0|Great historical portray of King George VI, his fight to overcame speech impediments, and the great leadership during WW II.
B0083Z614S|1.0|Hi there is a memorial service Virginia and the LORD looks at targeted by the heart of an important role in
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I would prefer this game because it kicks asa and like most are rip offs but this game is worth it. so if I were u I would download it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|It's interesting that most reviewers are so taken with this book.  It wasn't bad.  The story is engaging and it's a quick read.  However, I found the characters one-dimensional and stereotypical.  The smart but overweight and socially awkward teenage girl, the bitter and grasping tycoon, blah blah blah.  The time keeper is less fleshed out as a character than the other two, but as he's the catalyst for the resolution of the plot, he really doesn't need to be more than a few brush strokes.  The &#34;great truths&#34; of the book aren't anything new, but there are some nice lines.  I'd say the book is like one of those made-for-TV family Christmas movies--enjoyable and entertaining, maybe even causing a tear, and once it's over, instantly forgettable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a very good book that kept your attention. Going to watch the movie now. Can't wait to read the next one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this app BEST of all the horse apps I've tried.  These are a few things that skills make it better: different breeds offered, different grooming tools and tasks, more ways to earn gems, a way to communicate with friends through the game....m and some content that teaches about names for colors, horse care, breeds, different kinds of showing.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love it... we're so excited for Phillip & we can't wait to see/hear what the future holds for him & for &#34;US&#34;...His fans!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|i bought episodes one and two and am in the process of buying number 3.  I've also bought all episodes of Doc Martin and others so you can see I'm a great fan of the British shows.  Jo Story
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Adequate, it passes time. You don't need to spend real money to be successful and you don't automatically have to post to Facebook and fill up your friends timelines
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|Maybe I'm too old or this just isn't my cup of tea. But I thought every song on it sucked.
B00003CXXJ|3.0|When I received the DVD the case was broke. The DVD's were fine but are not protected by the broken case.
B004IK8Q86|5.0|My favorite, read it every 5-10 years and always inspires, makes me think and brings me joy,  highly recommended and loved
B005NKGEP2|4.0|Sheesh...I'm glad I did not read any reviews from this site or I would not have read his book, despite it's listing as an Edgar nominee.  But I did read it, an had a highly entertaining time of it, curled up on my couch on a bleak winter 's day.  This is plot-driven, escapist fiction.  There are flaws, yes, but I managed to enjoy myself none-the-less.  Looking forward to reading whatever comes next from this author.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|The last part of the good seemed like an ongoing rain report-I understand that it led to a conclusion, but very boring until you got there.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is super fun and oober addicting. this game is great for animal lover's all around.the only thing I wish was different would be that it was easier to get gems.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|I remember watching the movie. The book is always better, lots more detail. I would recommend this to most anyone who likes the genre.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|for me it did not work on kindle fire hd because it required a phone number might be great for a smart phone
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good graphics. Gameplay is nice and relaxed.  My husband said that the horses looked like horses.  Just wish it were easier to earn gems.
B00138KFYO|5.0|love her music.  memories of 60 and 70 comes back.  such a unique voice and pleasure to my ears to hear
B0013D6LEM|4.0|I have the album and wanted to download the music to my MP3 player.  Best thing.  Michael Jackson was at his best.
B007M45PMU|5.0|love the music and definitely has a unique sound/  songs have meaning and are uplifting and gives you hope for the day
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Love this show.  I have never been addicted (ha ha) to a show ever.  I wish it could go on for at least 10 seasons but I think 2013 is suppose to be the last.  If you never have watched Breaking Bad you need to give it a try - there is a reason why Bryan Cranston won the Emmy three seasons in a row for lead actor in a drama and why he won best actor again with a Screen Acotr award for 2013.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|use it everyday  easy to setup alarms well wrote application  would recommend the app to all those that need alarm can use rings or music
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|The character development is excellent. Seems like an exciting time in the Midwest. Historically significant but have no idea on its accuracy. Would watch again. Careful, it is very violent and graphic.
B004DM0UII|5.0|great selection and very ewasy to use.  I would recommend this app to anyone.  easy to keep track of favorite stations
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter, 8 years old, loves Temple Run 2.  She loved the first one, but likes 2 even more because of the 1 big bird.  She always enjoyed challenges, and this game fits right in to her idea of fun.  Thank you, and she hopes there will be a 3 that will take the game to an even higher level of challenge.  She says its &#34;awesome&#34;!.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|use on kindle fire and it does exactly what i need to keep track of items.  nice application and screens are good. like that you can write or type
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book brought to light so many things I never realized. I applaud Shin, and all that have helped him. I recognize the shame he states and although I cannot understand it, what I do know is he had an amazingly strong will to survive; everything else was raw human nature. Highly recommend this book to everyone.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|makes finding files on my kindle fire easy.  This is a must for anyone that is use to seeing directory structures.  you can delete etc. from app
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love or like horses this is the perfect game for you!! You can train your horse take to competitions and feed them and give them treats and sooo much more!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|i did not like all the differnt screens would much rather have something with less choices but the game is the same and works well on kindle fire
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|I liked the book okay but there are several parts that seemed a little far out there.  One guy against almost the whole police force set in the south like small town southern town police are mostly bad.  I would believe clique'ish is more like.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|not a real user of facebook so I cannot really rate the application it gets and brings up page quickly
B006P96PAO|5.0|one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product
B00B2V66VS|4.0|good game fun to play so far.  will keep on  trying and see how it goes but game is fun and easy to install
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product
B005K17RU0|3.0|removed the apps liked the weather channel app better.  just a personal choice but the same functions exist so i like screens a little better in weather channel
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and all the functionality i need screens are easy to see and use.  i would recommend this to others
B005VOXOYO|5.0|one of our better buys, we'd do it again if the opportunity presented itself; we're very satisfied with the product
B0064X7FVE|5.0|i love this app quick resource of checking weather and setting warnings which I find very useful when bad weather is coming
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book was almost as good as &#34;The Client&#34;, my favorite Grisham book. The book had just enough twists to keep me interested and turning the pages.
B004I744AS|5.0|easy to use and I am a bad speller so it helps a lot.  would recommend it for kindle if you are reading a lot and need to find definitions
B007MG360G|5.0|This game is so much fun! It keeps not only myself happily occupied, but it has captured my 15 year old.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfer is really cool I think and I also think that if you viewed this coment you mite want to donwnload this game because it is a great game
0375851569|5.0|Love Dr. Suess, now my child will also. The collection is great, saves money from buying them individually, and looks great on my child's book shelf.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! You will NOT regret reading this! I totally recommend this book! It is amazingly wonderful!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|If your looking for a romance story, this one won't disappoint.  I loved the connection that the two characters had and how well they fit together.  I would have loved to hear more of their story, but I'm a sucker for more to the happy ever after.  Highly recommended!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was a page turner I didn't know what would happen next!  Jack was very nice to August and Summer was too. I loved this book for various reasons and it tells what an amazing life you have.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had zero idea of what this book was about.  All I knew was that I was seeing the title EVERYWHERE, and for me, that means I need to read it.<br /><br />I sat huddled over this massive book, back bent, on and off for nearly a week.  After my free time for three days had been eaten up by the book, it felt weighty and a little confusing.  It was too much.  So I put it aside for a few days.  Then I picked it back up.<br /><br />I kept yelling out theories to my disinterested husband.  \\"I'm telling you this now so when I'm right, I can have it confirmed!\\" I said about four times.  I am usually really good at guessing secret twists.<br /><br />My first theory was right.  But as the book went on and kept taking twists and turns, I second guessed myself.<br /><br />What I could not have guessed was the ending.  What a horrific, confusing and dissatisfying end to such an investment of time and emotion.  I couldn't stand one single main character and their decisions baffled and angered me.  It seemed like a rushed ending that had been submitted to meet a deadline.<br /><br />Overall, the characters felt real and the writing was good.
B00065GX64|5.0|Terrific film.  Lorre at his best.  Very moody and atmospheric.  Extras were quite interesting.  Worth the time and price.<br />--DJS
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best game ever! It is a sequel to temple run. The controls work really well and this game is addicting.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a Fun game...also this game has a good story line...good graphic...good sounds ..worth the price of the upgrade
B008XG1X18|4.0|love it love love-love it!!!  I have gotten so many ideas and tried things I never would have.  this is the best app ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I say this an awesome game an three of my friends play it with me. it is great for horse lovers and future horse owners because it shows you how you have to practice riding to enter a show, feed your horse healthy foods, play with your horse, buy things your horse needs, and treat your horse. it is also great for horse lovers that cant get a horse, because it gives them a virtual experience of owning a loving, furry friend.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love this game, but on the kindle fire it crashes most times I use the Second Chance  crystals. This makes me lose all of the crystals used for the resurrection plus it charges me another crystal, so I open up the game again and can have negative crystals. Plus I lose all of the points, coins, and distances earned that round. Sucks when I'm on a record setting run.<br /><br />Other than that it's a fantastic game. Fix those bugs and it would easily get a 5 star review from me.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Basically this is &#34;Firefly-The Last Episode&#34; The Series never got the attention it deserved, not because it wasn't good, but because network bigwigs are douche-bags in suits. The show was buried, never given a real time slot and mostly shuffled to the back burner...If you love Sci-Fi and Westerns, you're gonna Love this. But don't just buy the Movie, buy the Series and the Movie...it's worth it. It really is...I didn't get to see the show when it was on, I had bought the Movie. I didn't understand everyone's connection so I went looking for background and found it in the form of half a season of &#34;Firefly&#34;...You have to have it ALL!!! It is so AWESOME in the All-Together...
B008BM9L72|5.0|Very happy with my purchase, loved the books and happy to have them on my kindle! Will definitely read them for a second time.
B009VA1FN6|4.0|I do enjoy a novel that keeps you guessing and this one did the trick - although I did correctly predict the little twist at the end.
B003UD7JEE|4.0|I found the Nikita series very enjoyable.<br />Plenty of action and suspense.<br />It kept my interest for the whole series.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|It wasn't long enough.  I beat it in 2 days. Lots of fun while it lasted. It has good graphics.  Also a good story.
0865479410|4.0|I particularly appreciated the chapters at the beginning on Stoicism and Buddhism and was especially grateful for a fresh look at the human condition apart from the positive thinking mania that has much of the Western world swept up in its crazy clutches. He pointed out that studies show that pursuing happiness for its own sake doesn't work, we become more self-centered and more focused on what we don't have, and we become less happy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last chapters fell short. It seems he couldn't sustain the energy he'd started the book with. The chapter on death went on too long and while there were interesting bits about Mexico, I felt he overestimated our refusal to accept our own deaths. Aren't most of us perfectly aware we're going to die?<br /><br />I found it ironic that he wrote about being open to mystery but had already told us that people couldn't believe in God because they now knew God didn't exist. He dismissed the religious concept of an afterlife with the typical atheist opinion that some people just can't accept that they're going to die. The author has, in all his wisdom, shut out a great deal of mystery with his certainty. I was annoyed by his bringing in Keats's negative capability and then trying to say it could also be looked at as \\"negative thinking,\\" which is not at all what Keats meant. Keats's negative capability is when a person \\"is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.\\" (The author doesn't seem to be very good at this.) He never said it had to do with thinking negatively and it was irresponsible of the author to take his words and use them in that way.<br /><br />I give the beginning of the book five stars and the end two stars. I'm giving it four overall because he's saying some things that need to be said and few others seem to be saying, or even thinking, them. Positive thinking doesn't make people happy, pursuing happiness doesn't make people happy, studying happiness doesn't make people happy. What seems to make us happy is acceptance--of uncertainty, of our circumstances, etc. (and for many of us, religion, but this book leaves that out). The attitude of not judging but accepting what is has been taught by the Buddhists for thousands of years. The Stoics knew it centuries ago. Positive thinking isn't a fantastic secret that was overlooked by intelligent people throughout time (all those smart people weren't smart enough to understand that all they had to do was think positive? all the world's great religious thinkers never knew it was so simple?). Thank God someone is telling another story, even if the medium is a bit flawed.

B000JMKQX0|5.0|Being a zombie fan I was very excited to realize the stories related were from a recovery period after the zombie apocalypse. Almost all the zombie material out there deals with during or immediately after. Within  the collection of interviews, the story of how the apocalypse comes about. If you are a fan of the genre this will be a great read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Definetly better than the first one and the first one was great game. Will keep you enertainex for a while
B0085W09ME|5.0|I have used Skyscanner a couple of times. Very easy to use and very useful app to have on my Kindle fire.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|The movie with Gary Sinese and John Malcovich as much as I enjoy those actors does not come close to the having  the same impact of the book. If you read this book in high school read it again. You were an idiot in high school and now as an adult this book takes on a whole new meaning
B00992CF6W|5.0|you should really update it to 0.6.0 because I have it because I have it on my i-touch and amazing
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Always a great read as are all Steinbeck books. Never a risk reading Steinbeck or an old copy of Mad Magazine. These treasures are essentials to the American way of life. If you never read East of Eden do so because the movie with James Dean is a real let down if you've read the book.
B0027MJU00|5.0|terrific book, i really enjoyed it. I would recommend to anyone. Gillian Flynn is a great author and I am looking forward to reading Sharp Objects next
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Much better than the first and the first one is good. I like the save me button. I need it.
B006ON41FC|3.0|so I tried to download it but I cant even get to that it keeps saying a error occurred and ot is so annoying I just want to scream.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best game. The quality is really great. please download and review. Also another great game to download is subway surfers
B003WUYRGI|5.0|It was really good. So good in fact I read the entire book in like 31 weeks it was so GOOD
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was great. I read the whole thing in two days because I just had to know what was going to happen next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game· It rocks! I can't get off it!I wish I could play it forever!that is what I think of subway surfers·
B000002KGT|5.0|Takes me back to another time and place, they are the best. Stevie Nicks just gets better all the time.
B000ICXQHE|4.0|This movie's been out for a while.  If you haven't seen it and like a good bank/hostage/mystery kind of movie then you should definitely check it out.
B00466HM28|5.0|Replaced a 49 key with this much smaller one.  Very sensitive keys and pads, sturdy knobs, fits in my laptop bag.  Only complaint is I wish it didn't use mini-usb since those tend to be more fragile.
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I know this show's been out for a while, but I usually don't start watching anything until it's been out at least 3 seasons.  Caught some episodes on TV while stuck in a hotel and continued from there.<br /><br />The show is entertaining.  Nathan is awesome.  Stana is lovely (and a new favorite).  And the chemistry is great between them.
B004UH84Z2|3.0|I should have researched a little further. The books are well written but not for me. They were a super buy.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this is not my 1st one, gave the last one to a friend to use. as advertized. have no problems
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Disappointing.  I'm glad I waited for video to watch this one.  It's wasn't so bad that I turned it off, but I certainly couldn't recommend it to anyone.  I kept waiting for it to get better. And it didn't.  The premise of time travel was silly and there wasn't much more depth to it than a cat and mouse shoot 'em up.  I prefer Bruce Willis' Die Hard series.  If you rent this, keep your expectations low.
B008Z9L94O|4.0|So the vinyl remaster of Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness is pretty awesome. This has been one of my favorite albums since I bought it on CD a decade ago. I'm not going to review the songs though, since everyone already knows this is a great collection of songs.<br /><br />The presentation of the records is amazing. I love the box, the book and the artwork. Very cool. Upon my first listening to the remaster, I thought the recording was crap compared to other 180 gram remasters I had bought. I find that most of them I do not need to play with the settings on my turntable or receiver to get it right. However, this set I had to change many of the levels on my receiver and play with the tone on the turntable. Probably but the time I got to Jellybelly I had figured out how to get everything sounding right. At that point, I thought it sounded great. It's probably not the best remaster I've bought since I had to go through all that effort, but still very good.<br /><br />What I don't like is that for $75, it does not come with any the special extras of the CD box set. I would have liked some of the b-sides and demos. I also would have liked an MP3 download. Between the lack of extras and the need to fix my levels, I'm only giving it 4 stars.
B009GX6600|5.0|It was a very sad and well written episode, I expected Ziva's father to be ill or something but not the ending.
B005CK76ZA|5.0|This isn't a review of Nevermind, but of this particular edition. Reviewing Nevermind is pointless since it is one of the top 3, if not the top rock album of the 90s.<br /><br />This edition is fantastic for the vinyl lover and Nirvana fan. I had the previous re-release of Nevermind on 120 gram vinyl and there is definitely an increase in recording and sound quality on the studio record. What makes this a great set is all the B-sides, live and demo tracks. However, keep in mind, the quality on all of those are not going to be as good, but it is interesting to listen to some of the progression of the tracks or how different they sound as a gritty live recording. I spent a good 3 hours listening to everything. The downside is a lot of the extras are of the same songs, so it can get very repetitive to listen to it all at once.
B001BJNIIK|4.0|This is a good old shoot-em-up movie. The scenery was pretty bland. The cinematography was average for the time. But it is just a good shoot-em-up from the typical Stallone type movie.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love it, love it, love it... will  hate to watch all the available episodes!!!  I will need a &#34;fix&#34; soon!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|epic game but 2 is out peeps 2 has ziplines too and is better graphics then 1 has lot o reviews
B007SGM084|5.0|These books are so good! I Couldn't stop reading them!  Once you start reading you won't be able to stop!
B004SBX112|5.0|My five year old daughter loves this game and she is very accomplished at it. She loves the different seasons.
1250006341|5.0|This book is beautiful. The pictures are wonderful and if you are a Downton Abbey Fan<br />you will just love all the stories about each character. It really gives you a better<br />insight on each character. They even have some recipes. It is on my cocktail table and<br />everyone comments on it.
0525425764|5.0|This book arrived in a timely manner. It was just what it was advertised to be. Grisham has once again given us a book we can enjoy and share with friends.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This books has lots of twists and turns.  Really good book.  I've read her other series first. So I am familiar with the Shadowhunter world. Can't wait to start the next one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Not exactly what i like in a read but very well written. Very scary outlook. Sad how society evolves and how the people become so complacent.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awsome i rate it five stars try this game out on your amazon app store its free!!
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I don't usually watch documentaries, well, because, I have enough reality in my life, but when my wife turned this on Palladia last night, I was drawn out of what I was doing.<br /><br />The Foo Fighters have been a band that I would hear on the radio, and not change the station. That's about the extent of my relationship with the band. They're a great American rock 'n roll group made up of some surprisingly interesting and down-to-earth members.<br /><br />The story was so well crafted and edited, and the genuineness of Dave Grohl shone through to really make me want nothing but happiness for the guy.<br />The scenes of him with his daughters and wife are touching and grounding in human way, not a celebrity \\"look, we're just like you regular people\\" kind of way.<br /><br />The music, montages, the older footage, all came together in such a way that made me really respect this film as a work of documentary excellence.<br />I normally don't even write many reviews, but I have been thinking about this film since I woke up this morning.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The update for this app on my I pod came out but not on this why???<br />The update is really good and I would like to have it on a bigger screen
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had some anxiety about loading this software to my tablet after seeing some reviews, but Kindle has always worked well on my under-powered phone.  So far, it has been flawless on my tablet.  Pleased.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved every bit of this book....all 3 books! I'm actually kinda sad I'm done reading, such a love story. I want a Christian Grey,!
B006LSZECO|2.0|This read starts with an iteresting plot and is a page turner to a point.  The last quarter of the book is a &#34;Jerry Springer&#34;  on the written page. Very disappointing.  Borrow from the library so you can quickly return it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is the best game ever but I found domain in less than 60mins + gold , iron to go
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This novel is a page turner with a cynical ending.  Not the stuff of &#34;The Firm&#34;  and many other of his first novels. The story lacks a likeable main character and although it is a page turner, the end disappoints.  There are some unexplianed bumps that made me wish for a tad more detail even if the page turning might have slowed the pace a bit. Another mediocre Grisham that continue to sell due to his name.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I think this app is great.it makes you be creative and its a fun thing to keep you from being bored especially for the parents when there kids say I'm bordered @
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you love Harry Bosch you will love this book.  Each &#34;Harry&#34; book adds yet another layer to this character.  A somewhat flat chraracter in the first Harry novel, he is now a very complex character well developed over time.  Since the character has continued to evolve with time, so have the plot lines.  Always a pageturner.  Read and enjoy.
B008G59IBI|5.0|This is a great album! If you love Green Day, or good rock music, your bound to love this album! Also, if you buy this, you have to get Uno and Dos!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|All time favorite book. I have this version of YOUVERSION - BIBLE on my PC, and smartphone. Thus, you can take anywhere without having to hand carry a book. It's the new way of Bible study as it offers many programd for self and group study; locally in your home, church or other location that is considered a physical church. You can also share notes or have a bible study anywhere in the world with others that are using the internet and YouVersion. I no longer take my Bible to church as I have it list on my phone or the Kindle Fire.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Tugs at your heartstrings. Really shows how strong a woman can be with her actions. You don't need a man who doesn't treat you right
B0063IH60K|5.0|All time favorite card game. This version allows you to play against the computer, ala; Kindle Fire or with others that the system finds for you. I play this a lot. Solitare helps you think logically, and is a value in learning to count. Great app, that is easy to use.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I've listened to the album a few times since I purchased it and have enjoyed listening to every song. Emmy has a beautiful voice. I especially love The Object of My Affection - it's a fun song. Highly recommended you purchase this album!
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|i love bruno mars music- great cd but wish i had purchased edited version-will b more careful next time :)
0316228532|2.0|If you're looking for the action-packed scenes found in Harry Potter, don't read this book. In a word, BORING. Small town London full of secrets, lies, and hypocrites. So depressing. I didn't find any of the characters remotely likable, I couldn't root for any of them and I had to force myself to finish the book. She throws about 30 characters at you in the beginning of the book and expects you to remember them all as the story flies from one prospective to another, so confusing and unnecessary.<br /><br />Honestly, if this had been her first novel, I don't even think it would have been published. So disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Just like a big kid I was very excited to get the kindle version. lol and my God daughter too!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have Downton Abbey seasons 1 and 2.  It's the most borrowed  DVD I have.  I have been<br />following the third season on PBS, and now have the whole 3rd season. I'm so confused as<br />to whether or not to watch the DVD because if I do, I will be ahead of everyone I know and have<br />no one to discuss the series with. Then they will all hate me because I will slip and spill whats going<br />on and OH Dear, what to do. LOL. I think I'll watch it. Oh, by the way. I could not believe how quickly<br />it came!!!
0375826742|5.0|My son loves the Inheritance Cycle, so when I bought him this for his birthday, he was overjoyed. He read the book in 3 days.
B007L96SI6|5.0|After a few listens, this has become a favorite. Great song choice and arrangements make this release a Haley classic that fans will surly appreciate for years to come.
B00009RAJH|5.0|I only bought this to get the &#34;single version&#34; of Say You Love Me&#34; with all the heavy guitar. Loved it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is an addicting game for animal lover's. this is more of a girl game. I wish you could get gems easier. overall great app. GET IT!:)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is fun to play but when I try to log on to share shuts the game down and want let me posy again
B006O3MU96|5.0|This app is addicting!!! I love it!!! Played it for several hours a  day for the first few days. Hope you love it as much as I did.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This app is great across all my devices and my computer. I have different uses with it. In places it's better to use my phone and in others it's better to use the tablet and the computer.<br /><br />I have a minor complaint. I find it difficult to manage admin permissions from the tablet and phone. Like renaming notebooks and such. Maybe I need a little more time with it on the app. Other than that this is a very powerful cloud document app that I highly recommend because of its versatility.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best thing you can play in your life. I love this game so much. you will love this game so much.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|Classic for Celine Dion. I love the songs on this DVD, especially if you have children. Great new mommy gift idea.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|these movies are a must for me, all of them.(5). i have got to own all of them. thank you/
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A few times I had to wait while the movie was processing, but I do love the series and enjoyed watching a few episodes before I could go and buy the season. This is a great series especially if you love the BBC type programs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is a good 1. the next one u should be able to have friends and run with hem in the temple :')
B0095VP8D4|4.0|Well let me start off by saying that this processor is very good for the price and the built-in gpu just takes the cake. My only issue is that from experience and what I've read, AMD makes terrible drivers. I've gotten several BSODs (blue screens of death) relating to a display driver failure and Windows errors telling me that the display driver failed and was successfully recovered. Besides these issues, it runs great. I have a laptop with an nvidia geforce gt 550m and the gpu in this processor matches that.<br />I can play skyrim at around 35fps on medium/high settings at 1080p. Try that with any other integrated gpu. I use the word 'integrated' loosely because this APU is more of a cpu and gpu simply put on the same chip so it's wrong to associate it with other integrated graphics that can lag on the least of games.<br />An annoyance is that no temperature monitors can seem to read the temperature correctly besides the software that came with the motherboard. I about had a heart attack when I had HWMonitor telling me my processor was running at 95c (around 200f) but then I looked at the motherboard software and it told me the processor was at 55c. So keep this in mind when trying to read a temperature. Speedfan also reads it but simply lists it as 'Temp1' and not as the cpu.<br /><br />I've already ordered a GTX 600 since I will no longer buy anything that runs off AMD drivers but this new combo I'm sure will work great.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book has made me look at love differently and made me thankful for the things I have. This book had me in tears, and the characters are well developed and I felt attached to them within fifty pages. Definitely one of my favorite books. This novel was beautiful and I recommend it to anyone who likes a suspenseful adventure filled with love and attachment. However, the ending resolution should have concluded a tad more. It sort of let me hanging and in disbelief. Over all it Wayne of the sweetest books I have ever read and Sparks has done it again.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book may have me hooked back on Nicholas sparks. I couldn't put this one down. Keeps you in the edge of your seat.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|my daughters think it's the best after I showed them the original - it was better than I expected and I'm glad I got it
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I have downloaded,but when I go to install,it tells me &#34;can not install&#34;.<br />Help! I can not get this on my kindle
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I remember the first one when it came out and now watch them all - my daughters like the newest one best
B00003CX9W|3.0|This special edition of the DVD arrived in good condition. The movie is not quite the same as I remembered it to be, though.  Animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is a book that is sweet and simple. I would recommend it. It covers friendship, bullying, romance, whats not to love &#60;3
B001AQT11M|3.0|This DVD arrived in good condition. The movie is not quite the same as I remembered it to be, though.  Animation quality has greatly advanced since the 1950s.
B008VBYN80|3.0|I think the prices of the things in the game are a bit over the top but other than that it's a pretty fun game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game was great any one looking for something simple will enjoy it. Good clean sweet fun easy to play and lean.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|the game is awesome and interactive.  the graphics are pretty good. would love to play this game anytime anywhere anyplace. definately reccomend
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the way Gillian Flynn wrote \\"Gone Girl\\".  I was disappointed at the end and crave more closure, but on the whole, it is a fiendishly cleverly written novel - keeps you guessing and makes you love and hate the characters.  Definitely worth the money.
0151003084|3.0|Liked it because I love Edward Gory but thought the book would be a little bit bigger.  All in all it was fun.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|More of the same fun with some added bonuses like more upgrades and better graphics. I would recommend this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|to find out what happens to all the characters and how the world changes, absolutely addicting. i wish there was more. i couldnt put this book down
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you are looking for an easy, romantic thriller, this book is for you. I love the way Katie 's character develops through the story. It isn't a mushy romance, but has its sweet moments. A few twists I didn't expect. Definitely a page turner.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|decision i ever make was to purchase this. it is an amazing book. i couldnt put it down!. it just so amazing and nothing like i have ever read!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Well written and enjoyable.  The initial premise is a bit of a stretch, but I liked the characters and the story
B00B2V66VS|5.0|With new features temple run 2 is a must get app. I love the zip line and mine cart. The temple trails have more hills and curves so it actually feel like you are in the game. I love it!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|It make the Kindle easier to handle and protects the surface. You can charge the tablet without taking it out of the case
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it's like having a horse in your house totally reckoned by me  you should totally agree to get this  Fun sweet fun going game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Best 99 cents I've spent in a long time. Great game quite addictive and fun if a bit morbid. the sound affects are a bit creepy. I love the game and have got at lest two other people playing it.
B004VMX5TQ|4.0|I personally think this is one of Bob Seger's best live recodings, and is certinally a testiment to his long recoding career. I have had this recording for years, and even had to replace it a couple times, and this is one of those times. I will go onto replacing it whenever I have too. Great album!
B006G7Y7GY|5.0|This book was just what i expected, good service as well. I purchased it for my son. thank  very much
B005V2S7FW|4.0|I really like this product allot. I purchased the 12 bucks a year to have it on my phone and tabs and to support the product. It's about as good as you can get given all the devices it needs to work on. There are only a few web sites it will not work on and on the phone and tab you need to bounce around a bit to get the usename and password in there... but overall a good solution for the many usernames and passwords I need to keep up with... I almost feel bad not giving them 5 stars... it's very close to perfect...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting. Matter of fact I feel like playing right now! I'm obssesed. I'm playing the Rio version now. Well, I'm done. Bye.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this amazing game however it is 1-31-13 and 6.0 came out yesterday I know because my family has an Ipswich and iphone and 6.0. came out hurry up people!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game! Love the graphics! I'm hooked! I REALLY ENJOY ALL THE NEW FEATURES! I was addicted to temple run 1 but the second one is so much better.
1594744769|5.0|I chose this for the high school book club that I started.  The only problem is that most of the kids had the whole thing read half way through our meetings.  One young lady read the entire book the first week.  The kids are loving it and so am I.  They are intrigued with the pictures and the story keeps you moving along.  Each chapter throws you into the next chapter as the author keeps you wondering.  The only negative I can say is the ending is kind of leaving an opening for a sequel but not sure if that was on purpose or just a loose ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game changes to a differnt places all the time! :) I recemend this game to everybody who likes Temple Run or Temple Run 2.
B004XZ99LO|4.0|I love all the Cirque du Soleil shows.  I have been to a number in person (Allegria, Dralion, O, and Zumanity,  Seen several more on TV.  The TV versions always left me cold.  The 3D Blu-Ray version of Journey of Man takes you into a place where movies cannot go.  I wont reveal the experience, but as with all CdS shows, there is a mix of water, acrobatics, and the ubiquitous characters who communicate with non-verbal gestures.  Some parts of the story are hard to connect, and it seems short compared to the live shows (or the movies).  Since there are so few 3D Blu-Ray offerings, this is a great one to have if you love CdS!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Exciting fast paced game. Keeps your mind reeling, and fingers moving, great mental excercise for an older mind :) would definitely suggest it to others.
1616550414|3.0|This will be a brief first impression review. I just gave the book a good look over but I havn't started reading it yet.<br /><br />Firstly I feel the Title and back are very missleading. 1/4th of this book is about the latest released Zelda: Skyward Sword. Then the next 1/4 part is the Chronologic order of the game. Then 1/2 is documented artwork of all the older releases. I feel the way its described and being called \\"Hyrule Historia\\" It should be geared equally towards all in the series. This book should be renamed: Legand of Zelda, The Skyward Sword with Hyrule Historia.<br /><br />It is however a nice looking book overall. Its rather large and the gold print on the front is very shiny, It would make an awesome coffee table book. The artwork looks great and I enjoy the layout. The Chronologic order seems to have most of the historia, I will be giving that part a good look over. I would buy this again for $20 but not the list price of $35 (no way).
B009UX2YAC|2.0|IT RESTARTS WHEN U UPDATE IT AND I HATE THAT<br /> BECAUSE MY BROTHER GOT A LOT OF THINGS AND NOW IT IS GONE
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I haven't checked out the 3D version yet, but I don't consider buying any new movie without a digital copy included- it's a must for your portables & it doesn't cost the studios hardly anything to include it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King hits this one out of the park.  A great book for Kindle (my first, in fact) because of its size.
B003WO4UIE|4.0|This CD collects 12 of BA's biggest hits. Why only 12 I don't know, but if I myself had to choose 12 songs to summarize his career, I would have chosen the same exact songs.<br /><br />They're not all necessarily my favourites, but it makes it easier to view his later years in a short time and puts them in perspective adequately.<br /><br />Yes, there are a handful of songs missing. I don't think I have to mention which ones, if you're a fan you already know. But not all people want an extensive collection like \\"Anthology\\"; there are casual fans who only want the surface, and this is literally just scratching the surface of his work.<br /><br />For a 12-song collection, this is about as perfect as you can get. Just keep in mind that he has done a lot more songs that deserve to be in your collection, but if you're a newcomer, this will make a good purchase... along with \\"[[ASIN:B000002GGU Reckless]]\\", of course.
B00555X8OA|5.0|A fascinating summary of a lot of the research on how we make decisions and evaluate data. Moreover, Kahneman comes across as a warm and engaging person, the kind you would love to have a chat with.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's a great idea. Love Star Wars Angry Birds! I would recommend this app to anyone. Hours of fun awaits.
B000KIPT30|4.0|In addition to being an audio nerd, I am a home recordist of many moons. Historically, when I make music, I'm entirely on my own and don't need more than one headphone output-- which is good, because most semi-pro interfaces and mixing boards don't give you more than one headphone output.<br /><br />Stupidly, much belated in life, I started a band... and when it came time for us to record, we realized we'd need more than one headphone output to track, mostly to distribute the click track amongst the personnel desperately trying to play against it in the same room.<br /><br />Due to the way we were going to record things, sound quality actually didn't matter much for this particular purpose. So being broke at the moment, I gave the HA400 a go despite a few negative reviews here in the clarity department. It mainly mattered that the 400 could deliver that all-important click track loudly to four people at one time. I was pretty confident that it could do *that*.<br /><br />I am here to report that the negative reviews were either made on the basis of defective units or were made by people who cannot objectively judge the quality of a signal when it comes through a cheap box with \\"Behringer\\" printed on the front.<br /><br />The HA400 sounds just fine. I've tested it when fed from my PC's headphone jack and the headphone jack of my Tascam US-1800 (USB audio interface), and have listened to it through six different sets of reasonably capable phones. When you get to about 12 o'clock on the volume dial of each headphone out, you are roughly at what you might call \\"unity gain\\" with the headphone output of your source. Past that, the HA400 does deliver additional volume (which has been very valuable in feeding the bash-'em-smash-'em drummer the requisite click; the headphone amp on my US-1800 ain't quite as powerful as it really ought to be).<br /><br />Distortion is sometimes quite discernible when you push an individual headphone out's volume up past 3 o'clock or so, depending on the input. At that point, where distortion *sometimes* audibly kicks in, it's already perhaps 4-6dB louder than the headphone-level input driving it-- no small potatoes. And before that point, it basically sounds like what you're feeding into it. No muffling, no extraneous noise, no meaningful signal degradation.<br /><br />OK, the HA400 might sound a *tiny bit* harder and less open / \\"transparent\\" than the source when it's not being pushed to the brink, but not so much that you'd really even notice it vs. the source. Certainly not so much that I'd ever describe the experience as sonically unpleasant or go out of my way to remove it from the signal chain at any point up to mixdown.<br /><br />And you shouldn't be mixing music on headphones anyway. Ask anybody. Anybody old-school, anyhow.<br /><br />At a fraction of the price of just about any other headphone distrib amp, this definitely gets the job done. You *do* lose the ability to make separate cue mixes, which may be important depending on your musicians. Personally, I just crack the whip that I keep on the wall for these sorts of \\"problems,\\" and magically, we don't need such advanced functionality any more.<br /><br />And if you're a Head-Fi type looking for a bargain-basement headphone amp just to push signal harder into your $800 Audezes so as to subsequently shower the forum in effusive, flowery and meaningless adjectives re: the end result, no, the HA400 is probably not quite what you're looking for. I said it sounds \\"fine\\".<br /><br />But for anybody else besides studio types, just needing a basic way to push multiple headphones from a single source, I have no problem recommending the HA400.
0316017930|5.0|I am not a genius, and it is not my fault. That is pretty much what you will get out of this tremendously interesting and thought-provoking book.<br /><br />The premise of this book is pretty simple: to reveal the truth behind the notions of intelligence, fame, and success. The American dream has always told us that our success is directly related to our work ethic. As long as you work harder than the competition, you will win. But if you dig just under the surface, you will find is nowhere near true.<br /><br />In Outliers you will see how you birth date can make you a better athlete, how your 10,000 hours can make you an expert, how timing is absolutely everything, how culture-sensitivity can mean life or death, and how IQ is simply nonsense.<br /><br />To say it simply, this book was just a fun read. I enjoyed stories and the numbers, and I loved seeing how such little things can affect the big picture.
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|I am truely sorry to have watched this.  I wanted to bail after about 30 mins but my wife tlhought we should give it a chance to redeem itself. Not by a long shot. In the words of Clint Eastwood, &#34;what a waste of film&#34;.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|What drew me in were the first 2-3 pages of a paperback belonging to someone else, I went back to read the first page again and realised I was hooked. If you don't concentrate you may find yourself going back over again as this amazing series of books is complex with multiple concurrent story lines which weave about like a many headed Hydra, biting and snapping all the way through. I found I had to simply accept whatever the author threw at me and move on until, as the book draws to the end, every thing drops into place. Erikson has created a world the size of Tolkien's but bigger, similiar to Herbert's sweeping Dune series, (the first three and best novels)it has the gut wrenching violence of death by the sword warfare like Cornwell's with the sometimes suprising supernatural aspects of Donaldson & Martin. What separates it from Martin's is that this series of books is more satisfying when finished. You feel you have read a completed story with a few hints that there may be another in the offing. Unlike Martin's that wander this way and that, while he backs his heroes into impossible corners and invents ways to reintroduce them unrealistically. Having reached the 4th book, I'm teetering on overload as I find this type of story quite demanding, forcing me to focus on it for however long it takes, usually 2-3 days to a week, with some very late, sleep-deprived nights staying up until &#34;just the end of the next chapter&#34; So if you like a tough read, complex stories, late night reading, all wrapped into a huge fantasy war theme then this is for you.
B009X01C64|5.0|I don't usually buy such a high end case for my devices, but I do always get some type of case or protection.  While waiting to order my new Kindle Fire HD 4G LTE, I was shopping for accessories and saw this case.  I decided to order it because I wanted to protect my investment and figured a higher end case - for a higher end device.  I had the case for several weeks before I could order the new Kindle, and already knew I loved it.  It is made from very fine leather and well constucted.  It has that rich, leather scent to it, that only top quality leather gives off.  Once I was able to put my Kindle into the case, I was in love!  My favorite feature is that the case turns the Kindle on and off automatically, when you open or close it. It does offer protection, both from handling and short drops.  I love the easel feature as well, and the fact that it can spin from portrait to landscape and still use the easel is unique to this case and a most useful feature.  It also features a hand strap, which cuts down on hand fatigue during prolonged periods of use.  You can charge the Kindle with the case closed, which is ideal to prevent any issues during a time when you are most likely not nearby the Kindle. It is obvious that the manufacturer really stopped to think about how we use these devices and how best to support that with their product. Marware will be on the top of my list from now on, whenever I need any type of device protection.<br /><br />Beyond all that, it looks FABULOUS!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good left u hungry for the third book!!! I would absolutely read it again! Now on to the third!
B00111YM5G|2.0|I thought this movie would have been better.  I finally just turned it off because it was so bad.  Very disappointed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great app but updates too slow I wish updates were faster maybe in future.<br />This app you can do anything build anything, no rules to follow no one to listen too follow your in rules

B004SBS8LA|5.0|It is so nice to play without the ad interruptions all the time. I don't have to worry about my kids clicking on something they shouldn't .
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is so awesome! I absolutely love it and I can play it with my daughter. she absolutely loves it too.
B000058983|5.0|I'm sure this album is not for all, but I was blown away by how many 1 stars this got.  I've heard albums deserving a one star and this one is not.  First off, when you rate this album, you have to take in account when it was released.  I found this album just this year for the first time.  I was actually mad at myself that I did not know about this album.  So here I am, listening to this album for the first time and it is almost 50 years old.  I was blown away, just like when I really listened to Pet Sounds.  This album is a journey and I enjoyed the whole thing cover to cover.  If you like the Moody Blues, you'll like Love Forever Changes.  I loved the horns and guitar placements, very neat.  If only this album had a huge hit, maybe like the Moody Blues Ride My See-Saw or Nights in White Satin, then maybe this album would have been looked at in a totally different light.  Pet Sounds had some hits on it, but the whole album is the journey.  But dispite the lack of a hit per say, it don't need one, and that is what makes the album so special.  If you are a musician or music lover of the 60's and 70's sound, this is a must listen on your agenda and a definate to be put on everyones list of albums to listen to before you die.  As Ringo would say, Peace and Love.
1612680011|2.0|bought this book for some one else. I've read in the past and recommend it to all college students to read and alert them to whats waiting for them in the world.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A quick easy read, but I wasn't able to put this down! I highly recommend this book to anyone debating reading it!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The inside cover of this book sparked my interest and once i started reading it, it did not disappoint.  Fascinating book!
B005KR6OBM|5.0|I love this show so its great to put these in and watch Big Bang Theory all day with no commercials!!  jo doesn't love Sheldon and his goofy laugh???
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is fun and good to play when your bored. I suggest people get this game. so get it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Being a novice to writer George R.R. Martin, I approached this book somewhat cautiously. Even though it had been highly recommended by my son, the immensity of the thing was intimidating. However, once I began reading I became lost in the world of Mr. Martin's fantasy. His style of writing is so lyrical it was captivating. The plot and characters, though many in number, were presented in such a fashion that I found myself wishing I could speed read! This was the first book I read on my new Kindle. Once I realized how simple it was to retrieve a definition of an unknown word, I was even more enthralled.<br />In summary, it is a great story written in a beautiful way...enough said.
B000VI6T6U|4.0|Very sweet deal, here....I just wished I could have been there, for this{ wonderful wonderful concert}...Jimi is FAR OUT and I LOVE HIM!!!!!! He is toooooooooo GREAT, even for his gittair.....He was wayyyyyyyyy before his time, but 'play on', Jimi......God loves you and had to have you, play on, forever, with God!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Oh my goodness. This series was just flat out amazing. This book, in particular, had me on the edge of my seat for the entire book. Each chapter is ended in suspense, so I just could not put it down. I just wish it didn't have to end. If you haven't read this series yet, you are seriously missing out. Go read it now.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I love this app! I normally don't write reviews, but this app deserves attention. This app does what I need it to do. The browser UI is not too bad, but it's organized enough to to start exchanging files between your android and pc right away.<br /><br />Great job on this app Mr. Devo.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|I have been a fan of Tegan and Sara over the past couple of years and I will be honest with saying that I did prefer their more acoustic indie sound than the electronic feel of their previous outings.  This album is all electronic but it has something to it that will not take it off of my iTunes rotation.  I am loving every song, especially \\"I Couldn't Be Your Friend.\\"  There is not a single bad track on it.  Even if you are more of a fan of their previous indie outings, definitely still give this a listen...you will be pleasantly surprised with how the catchiness gets to you.  And for only $5 for the MP3 album, you definitely can't go wrong!!!
B00ACB9Z3U|5.0|Each series get funnier. I do believe that one of the eppisodes in the fifth season was the funniest. The one where Sheldon tries to play baskerball.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Superb; let us hope there are many seasons remaining of the quirky, brilliant, fun show.  Should belong in the collection of every fan of Sherlock Holmes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Could be better u have to unlock more than 85 percent of the game but besides that it's a very good game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game!!!!!<br />It is alway clear never blurry  it always keeps u busy and it iskind of addicting
B009SIE6AA|5.0|I'm not typically a big James Taylor fan, but this Christmas album is right on the money for me! The arrangements are the classic Christmas sound we've all come to love, but he manages to keep the traditional tunes fresh and interesting, almost like I'm hearing them for the first time! His rendition of &#34;Here Comes The Son&#34; is wonderful! I hope he plans on releasing another Christmas album in the near future!
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I was looking for a stand to use at home to lift my 15.4\\" MacBook Pro up to eye level.  I was leery about making the purchase after reading the reviews, but I went ahead and purchased the stand anyway.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with the stand.  It does everything that I want it to and nothing that I don't.  The plastic stoppers work to keep the computer in place and I have never feared the computer falling off of the stand.  Some reviews have warned about using caution with larger laptops, I do not have that issue, but I do see how it could be a problem.<br /><br />If I had to find one complaint, I would say that I don't like how the base will sometimes come loose if you slide the stand back and forth too much.  This was easily solved by putting the arms firmly in the base and then leaving the stand in one spot.  If you're not a fidgeter like I am, you shouldn't have an issue with this.<br /><br />Overall, I am very please with this stand after two years and I am currently purchasing a second one for my office.
B0048Y9TPG|2.0|I was really excited when I saw this in the MP3 store! I have owned the first album (Merry Christmas) since I can remember and LOVE it! It's one of my all time favorite Christmas albums. So you can imagine my disappointment when I started to play this and all there is to it is a bunch of late 90's sounding drum loops, a bass line or two and some vocals. No clever arranging, no variation from track to track, and the remake of &#34;All I want for Christmas is You&#34; is downright terrible! Very disappointed to say the least. I expected more from someone with Mariah's talent…
006145205X|4.0|Haven't read the whole thing yet, but love it so far.  A fun book to read.  Makes you feel good!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It's nice there's two discs, Blu-ray and dvd, it was a gift for my boyfriend and he loves this movie!
0312933541|5.0|Fascinating story that you can't put down.  Pretty gory in spots.  I heard it is based on a true experience.  Hard to believe.  But maybe not!  See what you think.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|Great movie....shows that true love never ends. If you believe in love @ first sight go rent it. Buy now.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. It's filled with compassion and mystery and always Keeps you  on your toes. I second this book  to everyone.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|Good movie but not sure I can see giving any one my house after a couple of min talking with them.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app for kids and adults who are not Christian and who are.<br />Love this app!!!<br />Get this app for everyone in your family and friends.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|After coming off my 50 Shades high, the Crossfire Series was recommended.  At first, it seemed like a clone, but the story is more interesting.  The characters were more in depth.  Although sexual, the story had more to it than the intimate scenes.  I can't wait for the third book to come out in the spring!
B0000714BP|5.0|I had this movie but it got damaged and I wanted to replace it.  The movie is priceless.  I've watched it dozens of times.
B00846REIS|5.0|After coming off my 50 Shades high, the Crossfire Series was recommended.  At first, it seemed like a clone, but the story is more interesting.  The characters were more in depth.

B00AA0TJO8|2.0|I guess I need to call customer service, but the app did not show up on my Samsung Galaxy.  My Amazon account shows the purchase and when I tried to download it a second time, my device said &#34;Already on File&#34;.  However, it did not show up in my App folder and I can't find it anywhere!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun for me and my two kids ! I would only change the fact that there aren't different levels but love it anyway !
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was awesome. I loved all three. I liked this book the best, even though I needed a box of tissues to go with it
020161622X|5.0|I have read this book twice. Unintentionally or subconsciously started implementing all the practical approaches in this book in my day to day programming.And never got bored for even a minute.Awesome book with superb presentation.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok this is good but it updated on my Phone but not on here! Whens the new update going to be available for my kindle fire Hd?!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|This has to one of my all time favorite movies. The actors are great. The music is well chosen. The dipiction of the many types of loves is so well done. And, to make it even better the comedic timing is impeccable. Just my favorite movie. First saw it in London and have liked it ever since.
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book is just wonderful Carson Philips is the best character I have ever read about. His wit confidence and sarcasm. Chris Colder gets me to love Carson so much that I cried during the ending of the book.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This is an amazing picture. Prejudice of many types are inherent to the story. This is a one of a kind love story.  You will need a box of kleenex for sure. The acting is deserving of an Oscar.
B001PPGAIA|5.0|This film is fascinating. It shows some of the history of Darwin's destruction during WWII. The scenery is gorgeous as only Australia can be. I thought the treatment of the aborigines was respectful. It showed a disgraceful period when children were taken from homes and placed in &#34;schools&#34;. All in all this is an amazing film, well worth viewing.
1452110581|4.0|Talented writer who understands the complexity of a cat's view of the world and its place in it. worth the read
B001NHNG64|5.0|Great plot<br />Fireworks and lots of side stories ... well connected.  Action and romance with plenty of drama.  Great story
B007THA4FI|4.0|If only we had gotten to see more of what the dursleys lives without Harry potter in it.... this is what it would be like.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love this game.  It is perfect for playing while watching t.v.<br />I do have a problem with it.  I can't get a good downloan so I can never get to a high level as the game suddenly ends.<br />No way to save a level either.<br />In spite of these negatives, it is really fun to play.<br />It is good brain exercise!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy it. Wish it would load a little faster and make it so that you can play the game a little longer without running out of energy.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|It is all I expected it to be and more.  It is rich looking and my Kindle Fire is a perfect fit.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I've been waiting to get  Minecraft pocket edition on my kindle fire but now it should have 0.6.0 get it but wait till update comes out
B00000DCHI|5.0|I got this for Christmas for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it! She has adored Billy Joel's music since I first played his tunes for her. Great album!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Lost - The Complete Second Season Lost -now I have them all and can view them any time I want
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|okokokokokokokokokokokokokokok, thanks! i bought this to gift it to give other person, i received it complete and ok If you want you can buy it without problems.
B000INAXGU|5.0|Has a good compilation of differents Jamiroquai's discs, since 1992 to 2006, if you want to heard something new, you can bought abby road session or the 2010 disc Rock Dust Light Star.
B006LSZECO|5.0|It is one of the best suspense books I have ever read.  It was intriguing, the plot was twisted and it kept me on the edge of my seat - had a hard time putting it down.  The end was unexpected but terrific!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, very erotic...a must read! Ana and Christian are unbelievable sexy couple.. they continue to bring the fire in these books
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|So I love me some Angry Birds, Who doesn't? Don't answer that. I like the game (So do my kids) which is obviously important (for both me and the kids) to enjoy. I usually play at night before I go to bed. My kids on the other hand- its really great for a distraction when your waiting at the Docs or waiting in general to keep the kids occupied.<br /><br />Levels of the game- They are a challenge and they do update it every once in a while with new levels or extra levels. The game is fun and is at times hard but that's the point to any game is to conquer it. Overall I think it is a neat fun game and I like it. I don't think that its to vulgar or has anything that a kid shouldn't see.<br /><br />The 4 stars is for the commercials, they could lighten up a bit.This is the only downfall to the game (the non-stop commercials.) Of course we expected something like this because lets face it free is only free to an extent. So it does pay off to actually pay for the game if not then you'll just have to get used to it and deal.
B00000DHR0|4.0|Sent to my Mom for her B.day, she wanted some Celine Dion music to listen to around the house.  She liked it.
B000ID37KO|5.0|This is a must see for people who love suspense.  Also, it is a window to another time in the US that has gone by, when it wasn't absurd to row a boat on the ocean in a mink and high heels.  Some of the dialog is absurd, but Jessica Tandy really steals the show when she discovers the dead neighbor.  This scene is worth watching a couple of time.  Her acting is superb.
0689835604|5.0|My two years old boy love this book, he learned so much from this book, believer or not your kid will love!
0743537009|5.0|I have seen the film several times over the years and have read the book, The guy who reads this story is brilliant! He is able to transform himself to being so believable as all of the different characters! A very edgy and frightening journey, I was afraid to listen to this at bedtime!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm normally not a romance category reader, but this book had me in tears and I absolutely loved it. I highly recommend it.
0446554995|4.0|Preston and Child's collaborations (and individual efforts) have provided me with hours and hours of reading entertainment. I am fond of their Aloysius Pendergast character who takes inspiration from Sherlock Holmes, The Shadow, Jason Bourne, Bruce Wayne and many more. The series featuring this intriguing FBI agent has within itself a sub-trilogy dealing with Pendergast's wife Helen (Two Graves follows Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance). This entry continues to profile their trademark thriller and mystery twists. It represents a bit of a resurgence in the series that I felt had been dragging and become repetitive. I also felt Pendergast had worked best when he was a curious enigma but over time the authors were forced to reveal more and more about his past and capabilities. Two Graves erased this objection as the agent is once again interesting but for different, compelling reasons. Congratulations to the authors for resuscitating the series.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|bought this for my niece so she can play games on my kindle but she doesnt understand it, shes 4
B004VMUS9G|5.0|with this clock you can choose to shake the device to snooze or solve math problems, or wake up to music
B004JZBGWI|3.0|i dont remember when i bought this but i dont use it very often. its good though if you want to keep lists
B009VB998I|5.0|i bought this movie because my niece wanted to watch it and i did too probably more than she did. its a cute movie
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is a good way to connect with old friends and family that don't live close by.  It's a good way to share pictures and keep in touch over the miles.  There can certainly be &#34;cons&#34; to it if you share too much information (or the wrong kind) to too many people, but of course that should be under your control.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series. It gives a view of how the servants and the upper class lived and how life's trials affected them both. A well done series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I have a game that I just don't want to think after a long day this is it. It may be the same thing but it's a great game to kill some time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Excellent photography. Outstanding detail. Shows what HD is designed for. Sometimes like Christmas, I just let it play with the sound off when we have visitors.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Safe Haven is a good page turner and the ending gives a sense of &#34;I'm glad they are safe&#34;.<br /><br />The &#34;friend&#34; of the little girl and the main character was a nice little surprise.
B00005K3NR|3.0|I adore Stephen King's Carrie. The book is an excellent horror story as well as a harrowing look at bullying and adolescence. It even predicted school shootings.<br /><br />The film has none of these qualities (except for the school shootings prediction, of course). Brian de Palma's screen version eclipses most of what makes the book so good--the fragmentary style of panicked thoughts, the town-wide rampage after the prom, the telepathic connection between Carrie and Sue, etc.<br /><br />The saving grace is that Sissy Spacek gives a strong performance, but Piper Laurie is terrifying. Such a tour-de-force performance in an otherwise disposable film. I look forward to Kimberly Pierce's (Boys Don't Cry) remake, and I rarely look forward to remakes. If you've never seen this version, read the book first.
B004L03B3S|5.0|So. I'm not a big fan of love stories, but WOW.<br /><br />The two main characters are brothers--not \\"step\\" brothers as some of the publicity notes have tried to obscure it. They share a mother, and they're passionately in love. They even roll around naked on camera, which is mind-bogglingly taboo while also being really, really hot. Both the actors are stunning to look at.<br /><br />In a very non-American sexuality, there's no evidence that they're \\"gay.\\" One is even clearly attracted to women. But they're in love, erotically, and they are as attached as two lovers can be.<br /><br />This Brazilian film offers something refreshingly different than what I'm used to, and what I'm used to has soured me on love stories, particularly LGBTQ ones. There's no melodramatic scene in which they have to confess their taboo love in the face of judgment. There's no social, legal, or mortal punishment for their \\"transgression.\\" It's just a gorgeous and sexy love story about siblings. I can't stop watching it.
0060936223|5.0|One of the greatest books I've read in a long time. I'm a big fan on non-fiction, biographies, documentaries, etc.<br />I am not a huge Patti Smith music fan, but I have always been a big Robert Mapplethorpe fan. And I have grown to just love Patti Smith as a person and writer. I think Just Kids is such a beautiful rendition of a long term relationship between two sensitive, ambitious souls told from a poetic and earthy nature.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great I think she is excellent at developing a story worth reading and great sex.  Very descript. I would recommend to all adult readers.
B0063IH60K|4.0|new to this type of available gaming. lots of fun and really enjoy the hallenge, recommend to anyone who likes to play this game.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I DID NOT LIKE THIS TYP OF ENTERTAINMENT ON MY NEW KINDLE FIRE. NOT REALLY INTERESTED IN DOING THIS. jUST TRIEDIT OUT.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played in my life!!! It's fun and it deals like you really are owning a horse!!
B001BANK32|5.0|I love this book. The movie does no justice. My favorite author is Stephen king and I look forward to discovering more of his work.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|Very smoothe, easy listening jazz. Makes me feel the music. Makes me want to learn to play my tenor sax like John Coltrane.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I started the series and I couldn't stop reading it .I love these books.I can't wait for the movies to come out.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|it would have benefited greatly from a little proofreading. The rampant misuse of commas and apostrophes drove me nuts (yeah, I'm a little weird like that), and there were several occasions where the wrong word was used in place of one that sounded like it. Good thing the characters were interesting or I wouldn't have been able to force myself to finish it.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I cheered when Amazon started selling MP3 music a few years ago. It was time for Apple's iTunes to get some serious competition, and Amazon's MP3 store has done that. With the MP3 app being integrated with the Amazon Cloud, it's now easy to purchase or play my music from my Android phone and tablet.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This is not a movie with hidden messages, so don't go looking for them, at least not where the movie doesn't go. On the contrary, the messages are all on the surface, thrown at us from all different directions. It seems like a messy Inception with young \\"hot\\" women -- instead of Christopher Nolan's nerdy yet macho guys -- participating in their own dream within a dream. Instead of corporate thievery (the guy's world), we get domestic and institutional abuse.<br /><br />The visuals, with lots of CGI, are over the top. Do they make sense? No. Who cares? But everyone IN the movie seems to care: Women are generally good; men generally bad. Is this a revenge movie? Yes...but not quite. Questions get thrown at you throughout the film but never gives you enough slack to come to an answer. Before you know it, the movie's over. For some, maybe it's about time. For me, a novel experience. Sucker Punch is a dark, gloomy movie that is only uplifting in, ironically, a very depressing way. Who said movies should only make us happy?
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Although I own a Kindle Paperwhite, I often don't have it with me when I have to wait in a doctor/dentist office or at the car repair place. For those times, I continue my reading on my Android smartphone using the Kindle for Android app. It's saved me from hours of boredom many times. The app doesn't give all the convenience and features that I have on my Kindle, but it's close enough.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This series is addictive, tried to spread it out but too gripping watched all episodes over a weekend.<br />You have to see this.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Haven't been able to get into Cloud Atlas at all, have moved on to other material. May try at another time
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very addictive game. Hours of fun as long as your battery holds out. Family fun for all ages.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|We love these movies and have been impressed with the actors and with the stories and how true to life they are!  Great family movie and funny for adults who like movies that are not violent and disgustingly filthy like most movies are.  It's clean and hilarious and rings true!
B0047VSW30|4.0|I enjoyed this film very much. It does make me sad about the human race and all the horror we inflict on each other.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Holds my headset perfectly and protects it nicely.  Magnetic snap closes securely and fits nicely in my purses.  Highly recommend for those buying the Voyager Pro.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love to play spider solitare. It entertains me for hours. It's easy to play andI can win most of the time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun and challenging app. It take a bit to get past the 'easy' levels, but when you move on up to the harder levels it does give a person a bit of a challenge! I highly recommend it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game fun for hours. I recently uninstalled it to reinstall it again but it wont let me I cant even open it does anyone know what to do please tell me here.

1616550414|5.0|I have been a Zelda fan since I was a child with my first game being Ocarina of Time. Thus, my love for the games grew as I played Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess. Even the less well-received games are usually pretty fun and decently made. However, I came into the series during the time when the whole timeline debate got started so that does influence my perception of the book.<br /><br />The good:<br /><br />This book is beautiful and well-made. I received my copy without any dents or dings, and the binding was in good shape. The cover itself is a work of art, and the pages within are no less beautiful. The pages are fully colored and feature official game art. There is also an entire section in the back devoted to concept art of the main characters and enemies. The collector's edition also features a 32-page manga telling the story of the Hero's bloodline and is set before Skyward Sword. Some of the manga's pages are in full color but many are in black and white. Still, the art style is eye-catching. I was particularly interested in the concept art and was intrigued by many of the designs that they had for the various Zeldas, Links, and Ganondorfs. There are also summaries of all the games in the series. The first quarter of the book focuses on the characters and environments of Skyward Sword. The middle of the book focuses on the various timelines (more on that later) and the many games in the series. It also reveals the official timeline of the series and the chronological order of the games.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />This doesn't offer a whole lot of new information concerning the games or characters. Most of it is stuff that you can learn from the manuals or from simply playing the games. The only new intelligence offered is the timeline, and that's where the trouble starts. I'm a bit of a timeline theorist and was disappointed on the way things were arranged. The timelines seemed thrown together hastily. Yes, I can understand the order,but they still leave huge gaps and contradictions. Truly, it seems like the only reason Nintendo released a timeline at all was due to pressure from the fans. However, if you are not a big timeline skeptic this shouldn't bother you too much.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The good definitely outweighs the bad for this book. It is gorgeous and a great deal for the price. The art and sketches are wonderful, and it's a great buy or gift for any die-hard Zelda fan.
B0055OG2BC|5.0|Its not the same as the Daniel Craig, But its' funnier.  As only David can do.  Some parts are similiar tho
B000G73UEU|5.0|Favorite artist, favorite songs.  Just one of many Cohen albums I own.  Great story teller ... his life story told in song.
B000YPUFA6|5.0|fantastic exactly what I expected the cgi was the best. The action couldn't have been better.  Need more movies like this
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I puchased temple 2 for my daughter to her nabi loves it and so do i we play it all the time
1451695195|3.0|Although I believe she had a very real heavenly experience, she said that she was offered two doors to walk through, meaning after one dies he gets a choice as to where he will spend eternity. The Bible confirms that our decision for eternity is made while still living on the earth. Also she was shown that all spirits were previously created and lived in Heaven. Then God sent them to be born in the flesh on the earth. This concept is often confirmed by what God told Jeremiah, &#34;I knew you before you were born.&#34; If God did send already existing spirits to live on the earth, then He has sent millions to be condemned to Hell, because of the poor choices they make. Why would they leave a safe place in Heaven, to wind up in Hell?<br /><br />Of course, God knows His plan for every person that a man and woman would create, confirmed by Psalm 139, just as he knew and conceived in His mind the world before it was created. But that newly created spirit by a man and a woman is offered a choice on the earth to follow Jesus Christ, or Satan. An otherworldly experience must be verified by the Bible.
B005636HPS|5.0|By that, I mean Barry Gordy's nephews. Talent was handed down to these guys.  I like this version even better, because it includes a bonus track...and cheaper that the original!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|It came on time. It is an awesome cd! Go out and get it right now. All the songs are great.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|It was very good quality and shipped promptly. Thanks!<br /><br />Now I never have to go another christmas without watching because I own it!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this app!!! I could barely make it through half of the time without turning around! He was just running from a distance right at me! SO SCARY. I definitely  reccomend this app. By the way, for best results play this in the dark. ALONE.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I got the movie for my daughter and the more I watched it, the more I noticed how beautiful the music was. This is a great companion to the movie.
0895260131|5.0|I took a graduate level elective in Islam that was very helpful in 1998, and that one-semester class explained Islam to me in an understandable and extremely respectful way, full of generalizations.  This book is concise, clear, documented and brave enough to confront the most important issues. It taught me a lot.  This is a GREAT book! I bought several Islamic source books to check it out, and Spencer's footnotes led me to the information that verified his points.  Then I bought a few copies for my friends and told them that I have the key source books if they ever want to borrow them.  Here are three points that everyone should know.  Muhammad married Aisha when she was 6 but waited until she had her first menstration at age 9 to consumate the marriage (-you can verify this at Wikipedia for now). According to Muhammad, the only reason to declare a truce is to build up strength and gain the advantage for the next attack, virtually requiring Muslims to lie to unbelievers.  Muslims believe that Muhammad is the most honest, holy, and virtuous man to ever walk the earth.
B000E8N690|3.0|Bought it as a gift for my grandaughter. I will probably wach it eventually. I'm not into these type movies. Chick Flick.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is one of the best I have played!  I can't seem to get enough of it.  I especially like the idea of changing locations.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Watch this one first the get a copy of &#34;The Eagle&#34; and watch it. One leads into the other. Much more enjoyable.
B009MO57H6|3.0|You would think that a former model and present day actress (who is arguably the most photographed woman out there) would demand a little better effort in these vehicles she appears in.<br />Oooo, look out! It's the Umbrella Corporation again; and what - They haven't learned their lessons yet? Well, no surprises here today.<br />What next, Resident Evil X ?  Alice awakes from cryostasis to find herself abandoned on a dead spaceship plunging towards a distant star ??  Really.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|So the story is ok, but I really hate those kind of endings where the reader gets to choose what version is the real one. I mean, I am ok with fiction, I actually enjoy it, but when you get to choose if everything was just some dellusion.... well,it kind of \\"kills\\" it for me.
B009NCM248|5.0|Stone Sour never disappoints.  I can't believe you can grab it for 3.99!!!<br /><br />It is so nice to hear real music being made.  There isn't a part of this album I dislike.<br /><br />Thanks Stone Sour!!!  and keep up the great work!!!
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|This set is a bit small but you soon realize that it's solid and loaded with goodies in its compact design. It is perfect for collectors like me but it may be a bit too complex in its layout for younger children to play with.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|All I have to say is wow I was blown away by the graphics and speed. Very clean an sharp look. I also like that you can unlock other characters( which look really good too). This is a must have for for tablet or smart phone.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Long live Harry Bosch!....and, Michael Connelly, of course! He is a true L.A. gem and it's amazing how he weaves real spots, like these awesome little restaurants, into his stories...can't wait to try a few!
B008D28HYS|4.0|The app is well done. I've tried others that aren't as easy to use or see the end picture. I really like this kind of puzzle. Some end pictures are mediocre at best but others are excellent. I'm worried that I'll finish all the puzzles too soon.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great new challenges without taking away the simple grab and go fun. Love the addins and quick back and forth functions for upgrades &quot;very smart&quot; don't wanna spoil it but play for a while some really fun stuff . RUN ON!!!
B007G51UV0|4.0|Other than the Bells and Whistles that Z77 come with didn't see any big performance boost compared to an Asus Z68 board. But any day Asus rocks. I have been building PCs for almost 10 years and never found a better brand then Asus when it comes to Mobo.
044654759X|4.0|My Thoughts: It took me quite a while to get to this one on my TBR. I got it soon after it was published but I hadn't read it yet. But I want to see the movie so I had to push it up and read it! I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />We are introduced to Katie who has just moved to Southport. She doesn't have much money, walks to work, and spends what little money she does have on small items at the grocery store while storing some of the money in a can to save it. She's always looking over her shoulder and being on the lookout for her husband.<br /><br />Yep, thats right she has run away from him and is now out on her own. She was sick of the way he treated her and she had to get it away before it was too late. I liked seeing the flashback chapters so we know what she went through.<br /><br />She meets a friend named Jo. Jo is actually living next to her. She also meets a guy who runs the store along with his two kids. His name is Alex. I really liked him and the kids. The kids were so sweet and innocent. Alex lost his wife a few years ago and he's still getting over her death. He sees himself as content with things and isn't out looking for women.<br /><br />But when he and Katie connect, he can't help but fall for her. Katie starts to feel the same way but she doesn't want to get close because she's scared she'll have to run again.<br /><br />I liked the chapters where we got to see in her husband's mind and what was going on. But it was also very creepy. I didn't like his thoughts.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this Sparks novel but I have liked a few others more. It was emotional, and suspenseful though and I'm glad to have read it. I'm also happy now I can go see the movie and compare. LOL<br /><br />Overall: Enjoyed it. Read it in a day which is pretty fast for a Sparks novel. I loved Katie and Alex together. They were perfect for one another. And the ending was very traumatic and riveting. Wow. Did not see everything that happened coming. There were a few surprises in there that threw me for a loop. If you like Nicholas Sparks books, don't forget to read this one.<br /><br />Cover: Like it. The bicycle makes sense! So cute!<br /><br />What I'd Give It: 4/5 Cupcakes<br />____________<br />Taken From Princess Bookiethere that threw me for a loop.

B008J34466|5.0|This was a gift for my husband & he really loves it......plays it constantly.<br />It was shipped with out any problems.
B007KYQIEQ|5.0|Predictably enjoyable.  Hugh Jackman fans rejoice!  Meg Ryan, while improbable, Also delivers.  I really enjoyed this when it came out, and re-watched it recently.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great followup to the original.  More ways to fall.  I love that there is a surprise around every corner. Fast paced, and a lot of fun.
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I purchased the set as a gift for my daughter.  She received it, was thrilled to get it and then popped it into her mac.  Unlike every other dvd she has ever put in her mac, this one wouldn't play and she had to do a work around to get it to play.  When it did play, there was no menu structure as there would be with a normal dvd.  She would have to click on a file, each file is one and a half episodes, no way of knowing which episode.  And it was in Portugese.  Every time she puts it in to watch it, she has to change the language.  She is certain it's pirated.  I'm certain I'll never buy from that &#34;store&#34; again.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Clancy again creates thriller story with past character Pres. jack Ryan and the new cast from The Campus.  There are plot twists and surprises that come at unexpected times.  Scary to think we are experiencing cyber attacks from China now and that is the theme of the story.  If you like Tom Clancy you will love this book.
B005RAO0GS|4.0|Listened to this album on the beaches of Jamaica. Easy to listen all the way through.  Notable tracks include Seven Devils, Leave My Body, Only for a night, and What the water gave me.

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I received this bag as a free add-on with a camera purchase before Thanksgiving.  I haven't had much use for the bag since seems made for a camera and multiple lenses/gadgets and I am just starting out, so I only have a camera body and one lens.  It's just too big for what I need, but maybe once I get more &#34;gear&#34; I'll get more use out of it!
0060516402|3.0|I like it. It has all I need to add to training sessions. The whole series is good and I do not regret buying it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is so much better than the first one there is more upgrades and cooler people<br />I love this game
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Great show, well worth the money. Looking forward to season 2. There was the occasional problem with buffering. I would recommend downloading each episode if you have time; it's slow on iPad.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I never really use pinterest on my computer. I'm addicted to this app. It is easy to use, you can do everything like you were on the pc.

B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Great book.  Good read on a rainy day.  Lots of twists that you don't see coming.  I can't wait to read the<br />next!
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Unlike &#34;Diamond Eyes,&#34; a strong but disjointed effort, &#34;Koi No Yokan&#34; represents a new chapter for the Deftones.  On the last album, we heard the strained sounds of a band trying to survive a catastrophic loss in the form of anchor Chi Cheng; KNY is a whole new approach.  The grooves are still there, but the textures and layers of sound are subtle yet crushing in a whole different way.  Worth REPEATED listening on a good stereo!

1608193381|1.0|Chang's book is high on editorial-ese, but low on academic merit. Lacks a \\"References\\" section (or Works Cited, Bibliography) and uses instead a \\"Notes\\" section with entries like \\"Thing 7, 2 This story is told in greater detail in my earlier books: Kicking...\\" and \\"Thing 8, 1 For further evidence, see my recent book Bad...\\" A few concrete examples follow (compare to the many glittering-generality type of reviews):<br /><br />SOURCE EXAMPLE<br />Thing 4: from eponymous section on p. 32, the author Chang writes<br /><br />\\"According to an American friend, the Spanish textbook that she used in her school in the 1970s had a sentence saying (in Spanish, of course) that 'everyone in Latin America has a maid' \\"<br /><br />then devotes the next two pages to show its impossibility. Ask yourself, would a Cambridge student be allowed to state a counter-position via what an anonymous person said, about an anonymous book, used in an anonymous school, from three to four decades ago, in a paper with a semester deadline, much less should it be, by a teacher \\"in the Faculty of Economics at the University of Cambridge\\" (back flap), for a book with none? Compare it to this quote from hit movie from 1986: \\"My best friend's sister's boyfriend's girlfriend heard from this guy who knows this kid who's going with the girl who saw Ferris pass out at 31 Flavors last night. I guess it's pretty serious.\\"<br /><br />He continues on the same page with, \\"one can see why an American author could come up with such a statement.\\" How can he deduce the author's nationality when he's going off hearsay from a friend about an unnamed book? Even if it was designed to teach Spanish to English speakers, English is also spoken in England, Canada, Australia and other countries.<br /><br />It gets better/worse on p. 33 where he says, \\"if you read Agatha Christie novels up to the 1930s, you would notice that it is not just the press baron who gets murdered in his locked library who has servants but also the hard-up old middle-class spinster.\\" That's right, this Korean graduate is using fiction novels as reference material to draw conclusions about washing machines in a book about capitalism.<br /><br />LOGIC EXAMPLE<br />Thing 3: from p. 24,<br /><br />\\"Free-market economics tells us that, if something is more expensive than another comparable product, it must be because it is better ... So, if a Swedish driver ... is paid fifty times more than an Indian driver [130 kronas {870 rupees} v. 18 rupees] ... it must be because Sven is fifty times more productive as a bus driver than Ram is.\\"<br /><br />But turning back to page 7, Chang states \\"what a starvation wage in the US is a handsome wage in China\\" and talks about \\"outsourcing from low-wage countries, such as China and India.\\" Ask yourself does this reflect a fault in the idea of free-markets, or reflect that wages can be relative to what is \\"handsome wage\\" within that country, or that Sweden can some how outsource the job to Ram so he can drive a bus around Stockholm while seated in New Delhi? Is an \\"expensive\\" pre-transaction offering price by one party the same as the post-transaction sold price agreed to by both parties, and are either immune to the effects of supply and demand? If error isn't obvious, look up 'confounds' as they relate to the 'internal validity' of an argument.<br /><br />INCOMPLETE ANALYSIS EXAMPLE<br />Thing 2 contends \\"companies should NOT be run in the interest of their owners\\" (p. 11) but only talks for the next 11 pages about stock companies (primarily limited liability ones), with no discussion of those owned by a person, a family, or other forms of ownership. He claims that maximizing profits \\"means increased work intensity\\" thus more mistakes which leads to \\"lowering product quality\\" and in the long run \\"threatens [the company's] very survival\\" (p. 20), but ignores that a company thus run can only persist in a controlled market where consumers are not 'free' to choose the higher quality product. Thing 2 also closes with a hardly objective or Cambridge-worthy title \\"The dumbest idea in the world\\" referring to limited-liability companies whereby investors can pool resources that none can financially back independently.<br /><br />IMPLIED ASSOCIATION EXAMPLE<br />Thing 5 opens with Chang stating \\"they\\" tell you \\"[w]e have to assume the worst about people\\" without providing a source for that claim. He does provide a quote from Adam Smith (1723-1790, commonly referred to as the 'father of modern economics') regarding self-interest. \\"Self-interest is a most powerful trait,\\" Chang then acknowledges, but \\"it's not our only drive.\\" From there he attacks not what he quoted, but what he would like you to believe Smith was implying or said without quoting a source. Simply put, if Smith actually advocated the \\"worst,\\" why does not or can not Chang provide a citation (quote with page and book title) to that effect?<br /><br />So again, he is not countering someone saying self-interest is negative (much less \\"the worst\\"), rather Chang counters a phrasing of his own construction. No where does he cite someone claiming that self-interest is the only motivation in play of any economy. Does buying from a product based on self-interest (e.g. bang for one's buck, reputation for quality, taste you enjoy) or offering a product with the best chances of selling and thus provide most income in the shortest time (thus having time and money to share and spend as they wish, such as with/on family) make that person among the worst of people? Or is self-interest neither good nor bad, as there many different self-interests one could have, some more noble than others (health, fame, education, power, appetizing food, free time, ...)? There are literally hundreds of years worth of material fleshing out the role self-interest plays in economics, but Chang avoids citing them in their own words, but rather prefers to represent both sides and play counsel for both the prosecution and the defense of the matter at hand.<br /><br />AVOIDING PITFALLS<br />Every chapter starts with a half-page \\"What they tell you\\" followed by considerably longer \\"What they don't tell you\\" section of several pages. As the author and given the length, Chang presumably is writing for the latter, but by failing to identify and quote an individual for the former, how does one distinguish if it is a fair representation of the opposition or a mis-characterization (regardless of how appealing it might be to believe it)? This raises the question of the Strawman Fallacy, using extremes or miscaricturizations to represent an opponent and then claiming defeating those is the same as defeating that (unidentified) person. For example, \\"Scientists say the moon is made of cheese, I've shown it isn't, thus you can dismiss whatever scientists say.\\"<br /><br />Thing 1: Chang states that markets aren't \\"free\\" because the \\"free market doesn't exist. ... It is a political definition\\" (p. 1) and \\"There is no scientifically defined boundary for free market.\\" (p. 8) \\"If wages and interest rates are politically determined ... then all the other prices are politically determined\\" (p. 6) and thus not free. The claim is if it doesn't exist in a pure state, it doesn't exist. Even if an ingot is 99.9999% gold, by Chang's logic you can't call it gold because of the 0.0001% that is not. So if not \\"free\\" (or capitalist), does that make it \\"controlled\\" (or socialist)? Or, if mixed, does term \\"free market\\" (and conversely controlled market) have any utility? Could it be that the degree of 'regulation' determines how 'free' or 'controlled' a market making the later terms directions versus terminal designations, not unlike Westward direction versus the North pole (ambiguity fallacy)?<br /><br />Economists like Adam Smith and Milton Friedman advocate markets that are more free (direction) and also believe that government has a role, but it should be as limited as possible and focus mainly on providing for national defense (extra-national), a system of courts to settle differences, and protections to protect one citizen from infringing on the freedoms of another (intra-national). Is Chang equating \\"free markets\\" (economic term) with \\"anarchy\\" (political term)?<br /><br />\\"Is free trade fair? ... contemporary debate on free trade vs fair trade\\" (p. 6), but since Chang claims that free markets are a \\"political definition\\" (p. 1) by extension so is free trade. Fair is a moral classifications, not a political, thus it isn't an argument of two different kinds of trading but rather two kinds classifications, political v. moral. Should one sort shirts by color or size? Both can be done if you represent it as a bi-factorial not linear arrangement, a 2x2 grid of free fair trade, controlled fair trade, free unfair trade, and controlled unfair trade.<br /><br />(It would be easy to do this for every chapter and every section, but one has stop a review at some point.)<br /><br />After reading direct citations (above) versus non-specific opinions, ask yourself:<br /><br />' Is this book in my best self-interest to my spend money on and my time reading? Is this is a book about economic science, economic rhetoric? Should I purchase it or preview it first via an online sample or e-holding a library copy? And does my 'market' leave me 'free' to choose if I do or not? 'efense of the matter at hand.<br /><br />AVOIDING PITFALLS<br />Every chapter starts with a half-page \\"What they tell you\\" followed by considerably longer \\"What they don't tell you\\" section of several pages. As the author and given the length, Chang presumably is writing for the latter, but by failing to identify and quote an individual for the former, how does one distinguish if it is a fair representation of the opposition or a mis-characterization (regardless of how appealing it might be to believe it)? This raises the question of the Strawman Fallacy, using extremes or miscaricturizations to represent an opponent and then claiming defeating those is the same as defeating that (unidentified) person. For example, \\"Scientists say the moon is made of cheese, I've shown it isn't, thus you can dismiss whatever scientists say.\\"<br /><br />Thing 1: Chang states that markets aren't \\"free\\" because the \\"free market doesn't exist. ... It is a political definition\\" (p. 1) and \\"There is no scientifically defined boundary for free market.\\" (p. 8) \\"If wages and interest rates are politically determined ... then all the other prices are politically determined\\" (p. 6) and thus not free. The claim is if it doesn't exist in a pure state, it doesn't exist. Even if an ingot is 99.9999% gold, by Chang's logic you can't call it gold because of the 0.0001% that is not. So if not \\"free\\" (or capitalist), does that make it \\"controlled\\" (or socialist)? Or, if mixed, does term \\"free market\\" (and conversely controlled market) have any utility? Could it be that the degree of 'regulation' determines how 'free' or 'controlled' a market making the later terms directions versus terminal designations, not unlike Westward direction versus the North pole (ambiguity fallacy)?<br /><br />Economists like Adam Smith and Milton Friedman advocate markets that are more free (direction) and also believe that government has a role, but it should be as limited as possible and focus mainly on providing for national defense (extra-national), a system of courts to settle differences, and protections to protect one citizen from infringing on the freedoms of another (intra-national). Is Chang equating \\"free markets\\" (economic term) with \\"anarchy\\" (political term)?<br /><br />\\"Is free trade fair? ... contemporary debate on free trade vs fair trade\\" (p. 6), but since Chang claims that free markets are a \\"political definition\\" (p. 1) by extension so is free trade. Fair is a moral classifications, not a political, thus it isn't an argument of two different kinds of trading but rather two kinds classifications, political v. moral. Should one sort shirts by color or size? Both can be done if you represent it as a bi-factorial not linear arrangement, a 2x2 grid of free fair trade, controlled fair trade, free unfair trade, and controlled unfair trade.<br /><br />(It would be easy to do this for every chapter and every section, but one has stop a review at some point.)<br /><br />After reading direct citations (above) versus non-specific opinions, ask yourself:<br /><br />' Is this book in my best self-interest to my spend money on and my time reading? Is this is a book about economic science, economic rhetoric? Should I purchase it or preview it first via an online sample or e-holding a library copy? And does my 'market' leave me 'free' to choose if I do or not? '

B002G1YPH0|4.0|This fan definitely does its job! It's unfortunately the most confusing piece of hardware to install on the face of the planet. At multiple points I actually thought I caused damage to the motherboard. The directions it comes with are next to useless and you're forced to desperately Google search for a decent user-made video. The metal part's also extremely sharp and ended up slicing my fingers in a few places.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's different, not perfect but it's fun to play, my kids said it's a bit challenging. We love this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very addictive game, graphics are sharp and cute and best of all it's truly free. Collect coins and buy upgrades...no misleading info...it is free! I luv it!!!
0201633612|5.0|This book will forever stand as a foundation of software development.  The example code is getting a bit dated, but the priniciples are the important part, and they are just as relevant today as they ever were.<br /><br />Also, this book has some great foundational work that explains things like encapsulation, interfaces, etc.
B00AGKH7K0|5.0|Eric has always been an unbelievable talent....this CD carries on with his amazing voice and some VERY strong lyrics.......such a pleasure to hear someone continue on with creativity and not even resemble the no-talents who are recording nonsense nowadays....Eric continues 50+ years of greatness....
B000VZQM7E|5.0|This has the best compilation of Garbage songs available and for $5 it is a total steal!!! I suggest it for anyone who loves the group!
B009AMALGM|3.0|This one is not nearly as scary as the first and is quite predictable with too much info given away too early; however, the younger actors are quite good and convincingly creepy as they are used by demonic forces.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I love this movie. Its so sweet and it really is quite hilarious. Wonderful moral to the story and a reflection of how people can be sometimes. Great sweet movie to watch!!
B004HW7JH4|5.0|Don's new wife, Megan, is compelling but unhappy with advertising and wants to act instead; meanwhile, Sally goes through some major changes, Price does something horribly unexpected, Peggy makes a big change, and Pete has an affair.  Watch everybody carry on during 1966 in this season.
