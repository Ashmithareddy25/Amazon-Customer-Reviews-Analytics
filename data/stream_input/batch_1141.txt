B00001W9G0|4.0|I didn't realize I was buying the Widescreen Version of this classic! What a shame Amazon isn't more forthcoming.... Having heads cut off and the bottom of the screen doesn't make this movie half way as enjoyable. I was cheated. The Amazon description conveniently does nothing more than say how much money they want.
B004NYQYNQ|5.0|Like Joni Mitchell, Aretha Franklin, and Carole King before her, Adele has delivered an album that is classic and iconic with '21'. Infused with elements of gospel, blues, & soul, the album is a breath of fresh air in the current musical landscape that is oversaturated with party, rump-shaking songs that say a whole lot of nothing.<br /><br />'21' showcases Adele as a woman of many dimensions. In one moment, she displays wide-eyed wisdom and strength as on the driving \\"Rolling In The Deep\\", and then she exudes a frightening and real vulnerability as on \\"Take It All\\". Then there is even a hybrid of both strength and vulnerability as on \\"Set Fire To The Rain\\". If you haven't seen her sing \\"Someone Like You\\" on stage, get thee to YouTube immediately. The 2011 BRIT Awards performance is particularly emotional. While there are no best songs on the CD (each stands as a classic on its own), I connect most strongly with \\"Turning Tables\\". One thing is certain: she is aware where she is emotionally and shares it through a wide range of incredible music for our benefit.<br /><br />In the mid to late 90s, there was a wave of outstanding albums delivered by some incredible artists - Sarah McLachlan's Surfacing, Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, and Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill. I hope Adele's '21' ushers in another wave of good music even if the other artists don't quite reach the heights of this particular release. Unlike many of today's female artists whose music is secondary to their image, Adele uncovers and bares her soul on '21', an album that will be remembered as one of the greatest albums this decade. It's one of my favorites of all-time.
0743496736|5.0|Few books are so haunting that you stay up all night to finish reading them, and then you can't fall asleep afterwards, so you end up just staring at the ceiling until dawn. That was my reaction to NINETEEN MINUTES. For three days, I lived this book.<br /><br />The main draw is the hopelessly pathetic central character, Peter Houghton. Throughout the story, you ache for Peter's redemption, but it never happens. On March 6, 2007, he becomes a mass murderer, and for that he deserves to be put to death. On March 5, 2007, however, Peter was not a mass murderer; he was the victim of predatory bullying. It was so incessant that he believed what the bullies were telling him, that he was a freak, a homo, etc. Through attrition, they convinced him he was subhuman. He becomes a sociopath, one who sees himself among other people as a lone trekker in a deadly jungle, everyone a potential enemy. Murder, it's clear to me, is the logical conclusion of such a mental state.<br /><br />To single out bullying to explain Peter's killing spree would be simplistic. Bullying is the symptom of more systemic problems we face, like the feminization of our public school system. When Peter's kindergarten teacher finds out that he's being bullied--that fifth graders are throwing his lunchbox out the school bus window and pushing him to the dirt on the playground--she responds like the good Soviet apparatchik she's been trained to be at university. Peter must stand up for himself, she says, and the bullies will back off.<br /><br />Um, what? That's the reaction of Peter's mother, and understandably. Any adult, much less a competent teacher, doesn't tell a kindergartener to stand up for himself against fifth graders twice his size. She smacks the fifth grader upside the head, and then calls his parents. If the parents give a damn, they cut off their son's allowance or ground him for a week. Dare I say, maybe the boy's father removes his belt and teaches his son a lesson.<br /><br />But that's not true--at least, not anymore--is it? We are told that children are so fragile that they can't handle a little punishment when they deserve it. We are told that it doesn't matter who starts a fight; violence, even in self-defense, is reprehensible. Privately we reject these notions, but they dominate the public sphere, especially our public school system. These delusions are by no means limited to student misconduct. In some states, teachers can't even give a child a grade below 50! That's because it might damage children's \\"self-esteem\\" to force them to face the consequences of their shortcomings, whether academic or character-driven.<br /><br />If the bullies who make Peter's life a living hell lack anything, it's not self-esteem; it's discipline. Like most teens and pre-teens, they think they are God's greatest gift. This belief is reinforced every time they snap Peter's glasses in two or stuff him into a locker. His suffering is their ego boost. If they are not disciplined, why, then, should they stop? Why, then, should they develop a self-conscience that asks: \\"Is this wrong?\\" Even one of Peter's victims who survived the massacre is still oblivious to his own evil when, at the trial, Peter's defense attorney makes him recount how he routinely humiliated Peter.<br /><br />Ignorance is too simple an account of parents' and teachers' inaction. I actually think they are cowards. They would rather pretend there's no problem so they don't have to face it, because facing it takes courage, courage they don't have. It's overwhelming, the immorality that surrounds us. You can either take the path of least resistance, or take a moral stand, thereby risking being cast out. In the words of the female protagonist, Alex Cormier: \\"The right thing sets you up to be incredibly lonely, sometimes.\\"<br /><br />Alex's daughter, Josie, isn't technically a bully. She never touches Peter. She never ridicules him. But she does stand by while her boyfriend and his cult of personality do what they can to ruin Peter's life. When she gains acceptance into the \\"in\\" crowd, she can no longer be Peter's friend, much less defend him, and hold on to her new status. She has to choose, and, because growing up fatherless left such a gaping void in place of her self-image, she chooses the attention of her clingy, douchebag boyfriend over doing the right thing.<br /><br />For awhile she tries to morally distinguish herself from her so-called friends--tries and fails. Silence is agreement, after all. Since she does nothing to stop Peter's emasculation, she is effectively complicit. She lives with the guilt of her decision until she can live with it no longer, and murders her boyfriend in a desperate attempt to escape that decision.<br /><br />The flipside of all this is that some degree of conformity is good for children. At one juncture, Josie remembers Peter wearing a tinfoil cap on the playground to facilitate communication with aliens. The other boys are right to tease him about that. Oddball behavior is a barrier to assimilating into society, and the sooner it stops, the better.<br /><br />This presumes, of course, that society is worth assimilating into. If the fictional world of Sterling, New Hampshire, is at all indicative, I'm not so sure it is.ance into the \\"in\\" crowd, she can no longer be Peter's friend, much less defend him, and hold on to her new status.

B000002HEM|4.0|This album flows musically and it's nice to have on for background music or if you just want to unwind and chill.  My favourite song is Because The Night, I love the lyrics of that song.  The only songs I felt were average were the last 2.  They sounded to somber and it makes you want to just end the album prematurally.
B004132I20|5.0|I was extremely dubious about Sherlock Holmes being moved to the modern era with cell phones and high tech labs, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised.  These movies were great - I loved the actors cast as Sherlock and Dr. Watson.  I was also extremely pleased that Dr. Watson wasn't played off as a bumbling fool.  All in all, a great series - I would definitely recommend it.
1597801585|4.0|It's a radically changed future.  New York City and New Orleans are totally gone, just as examples, because of the overwhelming power of water.  \\"The Windup Girl\\" takes place in Bangkok, Thailand and it guards constantly against the same fate.<br /><br />This was not an easy book to read.  Paolo Bacigalupi has created a very complex future world and I didn't want to miss any of the minute details.  And because of this, it took me longer than normal to read through the adventures of Anderson Lake, Hock Seng, cheshire cats, Emiko, treadle computers, megodonts, the Tiger of Bangkok, and SO much more.  Currency of choice is disease-free food, which is getting harder and harder to locate.<br /><br />This is not a pretty picture of our future but it seems scarily prophetic.  It really is a masterpiece.<br /><br />Also written by Bacigalupi is [[ASIN:0316056219 Ship Breaker]].  It is written as a Young Adult book and is another view of this cruel dystopian world.  I also enjoyed it immensely.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|Enjoyed this text as much as the first. Felt that it dragged at a couple of points, and I got tired of the extended stay in the Fae realm -- but, otherwise a great sword-and-magic book for folks who don't otherwise read sword-and-magic books.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|What I have to say about this film is that it was actually not bad. Marty goes to the year 1885 to save Doc. Now to me this film wasn't the best Back to the Future movie but I still really liked it. Back to the Future Part 3 is the conclusion to the Back to the Future movie series. This movie is a very good and successful conclusion also. So if you liked Back to the Future Parts 1 and 2, then I guarantee that you will like Back to the Future Part 3. So definately check this film out!
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game has great graphics and enjoyable puzzles but it is very short. The puzzles were on the easy side with my only difficulty being with the lack of screen sensitivity when attempting to enter the safe code and adjusting the last three dials.  Ending was rather lame.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|LOVE THIS DVD!  I highly recommend it for anyone that has questions about whether organic foods are necessary.  It's an eye-opener!
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I wrote an earlier review about video and audio problems with the BD version after a second set presented the same problems as the first set.  It was not the Monster speaker cables as implied by another \\"person\\".  I decided to try it on a friends player.  It was flawless.  My BD player is now in for adjustment and cleaning.  There will be a follow-up when my player is returned to service. I am person enough to admit my mistake at jumping to conclusions.  A big thanks to Amazon for their customer service and return policy.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|How can it be Sherlock Holmes when half the movie consists in fight scenes? What about the subtle character inferences and observations? I'll admit that Jude Law did a pretty good Watson, but Downey Jr. just wasn't the right fit for this role- Holmes is not only brilliant and scattered, but also neurotic. The relationship between he and Adler didn't have enough context to be at all moving or interesting. The only good thing about the movie was the bickering between Watson and Holmes, but for fans of the Conan Doyle stories or the original Jeremy Brett series, you will be very disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|So, I have actually never written a review for a DVD workout before, but after doing the 30 Day Shred from Jillian Michaels, I just HAD to write one.  I have had the 30 Day Shred for a long time (a couple of years) but I just recently got it out to prepare for a trip to Cancun in June. I tried to do P90X for a couple of weeks prior to this DVD, but I just couldn't keep up.  I am a college student graduating in June, working 25+ hours a week, along with teaching piano on the side, so needless to say, I do NOT have a lot of free time!  (The workouts from P90X are 60+ minutes.)  Plus, P90X just seemed to make me tired and I always felt exhausted, instead of energized.     Since I had already been working out before 30 Day Shred, I began on Level 2, and let me just say, P90X DOES NOT compare to this DVD!  It was quick and I have never sweated so much during a workout!  Each session is 25 minutes, consisting of 3 circuits.  My arms are like buttah, and I can already feel the muscles in my legs getting bigger and stronger!  This workout is perfect to do during my break between classes, and I feel like I could go for a run with my dog after this workout! (Something I could NEEEVER do with P90X)  Another great thing about this DVD is that each circuit is different (there are 3 circuits per 1 session), meaning you won't get bored with the workouts.  Also, I don't feel intimidated to do the circuit again tomorrow, which is something I have struggled with when I was doing other workout DVDs.      I feel as though it's important to say that just because P90X didn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for others--I just personally feel like there is NO better at-home workout DVD for me!  Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred is AWESOME!  I can't wait to see my results after the 30 days are over!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I had the Kindle app for Android and I loved it!!!  I was having a problem, not connected to this app, so I was instructed to format the phone, so to speak. When all was completed, which solved the phone problem, I had to reinstall all applications. I was not allowed to do so with the Kindle App, as it was not available on the Android Market from AT&T. I thought that was where I received the last app. but evidently not. How I was able to download it before is a mystery, as the phone doesn't allow any apps, not from that store, to be installed. I can't seem to find any fix, such as an \\"allow unsourced apps to be installed\\" in my Sony Ericsson Xperia X10a phone, serviced by AT&T. I'm literally screwed now.
B0018RWMNM|4.0|If you have never seen Lonesome Dove, then you have a treat that is waiting for you.  Just about everything works in this movie.  The cast is outstanding, the story / screen play will keep your interest and combined with beautiful cinematography that is just a pleasure to watch.  With 4 hours of runtime, there is pleny of time to develop the story and characters.  Even saying that, I wish it was longer.  Reminds me of a few books that I have read, that I was sad when it ended because you begin to live through the characters.    There are so many good performances within Lonesome Dove.  Naturally, Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall are the heavy hitters here.  Both were stars before but believe Lonesome Dove cemented their credentials as being top actors within Westerns.  Even with these two seeming larger than life, Diane Lane is unforgettable as the vulnerable and heartbroken prostitute.    The only disappointment than I have is in the digital transfer.  The image quality is very good but falls short in the formatting.  Lonesome Dove was initially released in 1989 as a miniseries for TV, meaning that it originally shot in a 4:3 format.  This bluray version is reformatted to appear to be \\"Widescreen\\" 1.78:1, so the top and bottom is being chopped off in order to make it appear widescreen.  There are some shots that you just don't feel like you are seeing the entire picture...because you aren't.  Still, this is a minor criticism in looking at the production as a whole.    All in all, great entertainment.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I couldn't watch this movie and not think of The Matrix.  Very similar, but different as well.  I may need to rewatch to really understand the ending.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Hey, Guys. Like most people today, most of you think that things start when YOU discover them :-) Guess what..... The doctor has been weaving his magic spell on the screen for close to 50 years. He has been reverse-aging (like Merlin, coincidence?) since Billy Hartnell plied his way through the folds of time. I've been a fan since 1963 and it has never lost its magic for me. The stories are alot more complex and the effects are incredible now, but I really miss the originals with the zippers in the costumes and the \\"Hoover Vacuum\\" Daleks! Enjoy the new ones, but do youself a BIG favor and check out ALL the Doctors. They are all incredibley wonderful, each in his own way!
B004FOA84A|4.0|The only hard part was the globe, everything else was pretty simple to figure out. Great article though, and certainly one of the better games in the market.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I downloaded this app as the free app of the day, but had I paid for it I would have been disappointed at how short it was.  Had it been longer, it would have been a five star app.  The graphics are great and it worked perfectly on my HTC Thunderbolt. If you have twenty minutes you need to kill, this app would not be a terrible way to spend 99 cents.

B004A8ZWT2|1.0|I saw this on BD a couple weeks ago.  I wish I hadn't rented it.  I seriously thought that it was getting a bad rep just because most people hate everything nowadays and love to hate on things.  They were not wrong.  This movie was a mess.  Depp and Jolie star power you'd think would be cool.  Nope.  They have no chemistry.  It's quite bad.  It's not funny, nor thrilling. It's...just a long period of blah. Then, the story....let's just say that this was one film I actually groaned when the ending \\"happened\\".  And it's not the pace of the film either.  Slow yes, but I actually like old films with a sweeping story and not the usual Hollywood fare (though I like those as well). It just feels off...<br /><br />How this film cost $100 million I'll never know.  There are no special effects nor stunts, unless you count Depp jumping onto a fruit cart the death defying stunt of the year.  There's another scene where Jolie drives a boat.  Pulling another boat.  For maybe a couple hundred feet.  Exciting.  The film tries to pretend it's smart, but it's ending is so so lame and bad it makes a bad video game (see movie tie in games) seem like Oscar material.  Sorry, not even Jolie can save this Tourist from going home.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This game is the best &quot;escape&quot; game on the market. Graphics are great, puzzles are difficult but not impossible, the story (however minimal it is) was good. The only reason for the 4 stars is how short the game was.
0316056863|5.0|The book had me laughing out loud throughout.  It's very similar to the tone of 30 Rock which is one of my favorite shows.  It's a very interesting read with some golden nuggets of wisdom sprinkled in. I loved every minute of it and plan to buy more copies of this book as gifts for my friends.  I think what makes Tina Fey so likeable is that she is very intelligent & witty yet humble and normal.  A great read with some humorous old photos of Tina. Highly recommend!
0684853523|5.0|As a lifelong fan of the work by Mr. Stephen King, I am happy to declare this book does not disappoint. Mr. King provides his readers with useful writing tips that he has learned along his journey as an author.  He also shares personal stories about turning points in his life that have helped to shape and define his writing style. This book was a delight to read. The only criticism I have is that I wish it were longer in length as I finished reading it in two sittings. I would highly recommend this book to everyone and especially to fans of Mr. King.
B004O86JZ4|5.0|First, I have to say that I never write reviews.  I also don't think that I need comment much on the content of the album itself; the 100+ reviews do an adequate job.  It is quite possibly one of the best Rock & Roll records of all time.    The reason for me writing this is to RAVE about the quality of the vinyl discs.  When ordering this item I couldn't understand why it was a double album; the quantity of songs and their length did not appear to warrant two records.  So I put side A on my vintage 70's Thorens turntable, and cranked up the volume (instructions on the recording ask it to be played at maximum volume) on my old Marantz amp/preamp and realized why 2 records.    As if the brilliance of the recording wasn't enough, it is pressed in 45 rpm.  Anyone with an understanding of analogue music knows, the faster the speed, the better the sound quality.  This is without a doubt the BEST recorded material I have ever played.  It sounds and feels like the band is playing in my living room.  I bought the CD version of this album as well (the vinyl was back ordered by Amazon and I just couldn't wait) and although one of the finest CD's in terms of sound quality that I have listened to, the vinyl pressing just blows it away.  Simply AMAZING!
B004TANJG4|5.0|This album returns Duran Duran to their roots and is fantastic for those of us who have listened for 30 years!  New songs have clear links to Friends of Mine, Chauffeur, My Own Way, Careless Memories and other classic DD.  See them live if you can.  Simon is back in form and they all seem relaxed and seem to enjoy performing.  Very different from 2008.
B004G6009K|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie at the pictures in 3d and highly recommend it to anyone  in need of a laugh and a wake up call to life    It is enjoyable from start to finish and we especially enjoyed the horse/dog scene with rapunzel    You will not regret buying this dvd
B004SBX112|1.0|While this paid app is mostly ad-free, there are still the occasional video ads. I've noticed them a lot among the Twitter bonus levels. Not only are they annoying as Hell, but the screw up the actual game. I've had to close and restart every time a video ad runs. I paid for ad free and that's what I want! Otherwise I would have saved my $.99 and played with WiFi and mobile internet turned off.
0316017922|5.0|As with all of Malcolm Gladwell's book, Outliers is crack journalism, brilliant, and fascinating.

0061715050|3.0|Being a Narnia fan I was excited to see that \\"A Celebration of the First Edition\\" of LWW was published.  This is a hardcover with dustjacket and includes one color illustration of Aslan playing with Susan and Lucy.  The first few pages are different but the story printing on each page coincides with the first edition.  The reason I gave it only 3 stars is there are several pages in the story where the ink must have been running short on the printer because some of the words are difficult to make out.  Also, the book boards are covered with paper not cloth and the pages are glued not sewn.  The Chronicles of Narnia have such a huge following.  I think I speak for all book fans of this series in saying I wish a publisher would get it right.  Print the Chronicles of Narnia as they were originally published including cloth boards and sewn pages.  A little quality in this product would be a huge seller.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really fun, wish it was longer, hopefully with a  new upgrade there will be a sequel maybe prequel. It dies forclose a bit but you just need to restart it.

0060558121|4.0|My only prior experience with Neil Gaiman's work in the Sandman graphic novels. Having enjoyed the surrealism and oddness of those, I thought I'd give American Gods a shot.<br /><br />Plot Summery (MINOR SPOILERS)--Shadow is released from prison to find that his wife and best friend are dead, and he has no job or life to go home to. He is recruited by Mr. Wednesday as an errand boy, and soon discovers that Mr. Wednesday is actually a god. The gods of many religions followed their believers to America, but have since been largely forgotten or ignored. Wednesday's goal is to gather other old school gods to battle the new gods of America--things like credit cards, the internet, and cancer. The story follows Shadow as he observes the ways of gods and ultimately realizes the part he has to play in the scheme of things.<br /><br />This book requires a good amount of patience on the part of the reader. The plot rambles and sidetracks, and you have to be willing to get through a lot of detail that seems random and unrelated before everything comes together. For a fantasy novel, there isn't much in the way of world building or explaining--it's all showing and little telling. In other word, rarely if ever does a character explain \\"I Loki. I'm a Norse God.\\"--you have to figure a lot out for yourself or just remain ignorant. I thought about giving up several times, but was intrigued just enough to continue. I'm glad I did, because in the end it was a very rewarding and thought provoking reading experience.<br /><br />Shadow is a character about whom I have conflicting feelings. Gaiman gives him a minimum of character traits, letting him remain a ghost-like observer rather then an active character for most of the book. He shows few strong reactions to the fantastic things he sees and is told, just going along with everything. At one point another character comments that he doesn't seem very alive, and I'd say that's quite accurate. On one hand I feel that this is a terrible way to portray a main character, but on the other hand I can't think of a better way to tell this particular story. After all, the story is really about the gods. When Shadow did start to show development and liveliness (in the last 100 pages or so) I really found myself liking him. The other characters are extremely intriguing and well written.<br /><br />Overall, while not a perfect epic reading experience, this book was worth the time I invested in in. It portrays Gods as victims of their believers, and America as a muddled and fascinating mix of cultures. 4.5 stars.ter, but on the other hand I can't think of a better way to tell this particular story.

0316069353|4.0|I read all of Micheal Cornelly's Harry Bosch and Lincoln lawyer series, some of them more than twice. Yes there are few downers but as a whole I really can't complain too much about his work. The same goes to his new book, the fifth witness. In fact, I really enjoyed and finished in two days. If you like his work, there is no reason for hesitation. Get this book and submerge yourself into the story. Mickey is evolving just like everybody in a dog-eat-dog world we are currently living in. Not the best book you've ever read but good enough to read.
B00005JLD4|5.0|\\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" awakened me to the plight of the Australian Aboriginal people.  I didn't realize that a law was created to breed the aboriginal blood out of half-castes, as they were called.  Supposedly, it was for their own good.  To make them more acceptable to society and they can find jobs.  Sometimes it's so hard to believe how fellow human beings can be so cruel. They literally tore away children from their parents and although there was no indication in the film that they were mistreated horribly, it is still inhumane.  But in every human tragedy, a person will rise up to challenge the status quo.  The girl named Molly led her younger sister Daisy, and cousin Gracie through the desert, eluding capture by a trained tracker, until Gracie is fooled by the promise of meeting her mother a train station.  For months, nobody could find Molly and Daisy.  It's a testament to human survival.  This movie is based on a true story and at the end, you will actually see the two sisters, very old now.<br /><br />Another amazing fact about this film is the children who played the lead characters where auditioned from aboriginal children who had no previous acting experience.  I commend the brilliance of Phillip Noyce and his rationale for doing this.  It made an impact in the story-telling.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon for recommending this film to me!
0670022411|1.0|I absolutely hated this book.  The book starts out with a fun plot and then degenerates into a romance novel with sexists themes running through it. The females in the book are weak and constantly look to the main male character to save them.  I found it highly offensive.  I had to quit reading it about half way through and I never quit books.  DON'T BUY IT!
B0011Z52EW|5.0|I just purchased this the album after watching \\"The Black Parade Is Dead\\" concert from Mexico on HDNet and being thoroughly impressed by My Chemical Romance's solid performance.  Solid album, too.  Seemingly a wry take on the subject of cancer, death and dying.  The talent therein is to be respected and a complete listen is always the case for albums that are \\"Classic\\".  This album was definitely an event and one hopes that the band never comes to regret that they, ironically, gave it life.  The Black Parade Is Dead!  Long Live The Black Parade!

B004LGPBZI|3.0|Not a bad album. Liam's \\"new\\" band made up of last incarnation of Oasis so they work well together. So good tunes and some mellow ones. I was expecting a little  more punch but guess that came from Noel and band tension.     Produced by Steve Lillywhite (U2, DMB, Big Country), it is well paced and formatted. Good album worth listening too as it grows on you like most good albums.

B0028N72A8|4.0|At first glance the book seems a painfully eclectic, possibly disconnected one. What authorial vision can possibly hold together chapters on chefs, Chinese censorship, and book scanning? The answer it turns out, is that these, like global mapping and indexing the human genome, are all part of the Google story. It is evident that The Google Story is going to require constant updating, and one looks forward not only to Sergey and Larry's next outrageous adventure, but also to Vise and Malseed's intelligent retelling of it.    For a full review see Interface, Volume 7, Issue 2.
B0010HA68I|5.0|I travel alot and I am really an adverturer.  I love this product for my Nikon D5000 because it is so versitle.  I have this product on 2 of my backpacks and also on the front of one of them as well  I can shoot then let my camera hang from my sholder straps and for my where i have them placed on the straps I can let the camera rest but it is ready to shoot in a second.  It is also nice to have the camera hang from my straps because it counter weights my pack a bit.  I also find that I never have neck or sholder pain by it hanging from the backpack straps.  We all know how it feels after a day of hiking or being at a zoo to long with heavy camera around our necks!  No pain and no worries.  Great product!  Anyone with a camera should have a few pairs.  I sure do!
B000001GAE|3.0|Maurizio Pollini is the perfect pianist to listen to when you want to get introduced to a work you are only slightly familiar with or not at all. You may be sure that you will not get any monkey tricks with that man. He plays everything as objectively as possible in so subjective a world; no weird accents or wild tempo fluctuations with Pollini. His technique is stupendous and it seems that he can play, literally, everything with ease. The problem is that this rigidity of approach may work very well in Stravinsky and Schoenberg, but in Chopin and Liszt it is nearly disastrous.    If you are (un)fortunate enough Pollini's rendition of Liszt's Sonata to be the first one you have ever heard, everything would be just wonderful. I have not been so fortunate. It is difficult to imagine how anybody who loves the work might give less than three stars to this performance - for the music is so great, that even when played without the slightest amount of imagination it is an exhilarating experience. I also understand that some people, apparently admirers of anti-Romantic piano playing, may find this disc worthy of four or five stars, but I am not one of them. For Liszt's Sonata is infinitely more than tremendous technical feat. It requires passion and poetry, abandon and rhetoric, a great deal of imagination and a very fine sense for building a dramatic climax - everything, in short, that Pollini completely lacks. He more or less completely misses the point of the work, sounding dull and drab, not to say mechanical and monotonous, almost all the time. Even Zimerman, who is far removed from my favourite pianists, I would prefer over Pollini any time. To put the Italian pianist in the league of Bolet, Arrau or Gilels, or even in the league of the monstrously fast Weissenberg, Howard and Argerich, would be absurd. Though I don't particularly like Brendel, Berman or Richter in the Sonata, I do prefer any of them over Pollini, too; these men (and one woman) at least show some personality on the keyboard, no matter that I dislike it.    Also, I have to say, DG have done a very poor job with the sound. It is crisp and well-balanced, to be sure, but abominably flat and to speak of anything like sonority or depth would be to misuse the words. The booklet is just as disappointing. It contains an amazingly dull essay by one Paolo Petazzi (who?) which combines boring technical analyses with superficial historical overview in the worst 'liner-notes-style' possible. Last but not least, a total duration of about 45 minutes - nearly half of the maximum capacity - is a crime against the buyer (unless you find the CD at 50% reduced price as I did).    Excellenet CD to get rid of by giving it as a gift to somebody who is a perfect newcomer to the field of Liszt and his magisterial Sonata.    P.S. The 'bonus tracks' fair quite a bit better, by the way, since Pollini is obviously more comfortable in Liszt's no less unique, but far less artistically challenging, late pieces. Unfortunately, they are by far not enough to compensate for his vapid rendition of the Sonata.
B002IKLNW4|1.0|Unfortunately, I find little to recommend this book.  I am trying to finish the last quarter of the book, hoping to discover some redeeming qualities.  I expected humorous descriptions and experiences.  I expected to discover new places to explore on my travels.  Instead, I found a mean-spirited writer, who apparently found little to recommend in small-town America.  His descriptions of the many towns he visited are repetitive and boring.  His thoughts about the people he met are almost universally unkind, elitist, judgemental,and sexist.  Even the comments about poverty and wealth in America have the feel of predisposition, not insight. Sarcasm is a poor imitation of humor.
B002WN8IQQ|5.0|Walk the Line is a great movie.  It pays tribute to an iconic husband and wife team.  It was very heartwarming to see that the \\"man in black\\" had a vulnerable side and had such a love for June. I love this movie!!!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was never a big fan of Zombie movies, however, this TV miniseries is an exception to all the Zombies I've seen before. All characters, even the minor roles, are very well written and behave in a logical and believable way. The storyline is great and full of suspense that kept everyone holding their breath. The production surpasses that of some Hollywood big moves, and the actors did a great job. The picture / sound quality of the DVD on a big screen TV is very good to excellent. If you like Zombies, this one is definitely worth watching.<br /> Now I can't wait to watch the new season.

0385341679|5.0|As sad as I am to see the series end, this was a fantastic story.      First of all, aesthetically, this book is BEAUTIFUL if you did get the hard cover.  The colors and design is gorgeous.    Second, the story picks up quickly and doesn't let go until the end.  I loved the way the story grabs you and doesn't let go until the ride is over.  I loaned the series to a friend of mine that is a self-professed \\"turtle\\" reader, and she finished the ENTIRE series in two weeks, and for her that was a record, especially considering she works a full time job as well.    I loved the characters and I loved the developement of the story.  I also loved the way that she left the door open for more later on.  I am sure that a story of this magnitude is a drain on a writer, but I do hope that she eventually brings us more of some of the other characters.  Rather than leave a spoiler here, I will just say that there are characters that have piqued my curiosity and I will be thrilled if Karen can create another story with those characters in mind.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK first a little background. About 9 months ago, I was living in New York City and a svelt/toned 135 lbs (height: 5'4). I was so used to walking everywhere on top of the occasional workout at the gym. I must have taken that for granted because I moved to the suburbs, drove everywhere, and started winter hibernation. Bam, I found myself hovering around 155 lbs, not fitting into any of my clothes and feeling disgusting about myself.    One day at Target, I spotted this DVD and for $10 bucks I said what the hell.    OHMYGOD. First, I have to agree with most of the positive reviews on here. You will feel like dying. (level 1, day 1). I repeat, you will be panting and sweating and screaming profanities at her. But she is SO good at keeping you motivated, and really for 20 minutes a day, you can push yourself through hell, just to get to the bright other side. And there is a bright other side. Immediately after I showered, I had that post-workout exhiliration, that almost feels like a natural high. Only THREE days after doing Level 1 workouts (and yes, watching what I eat), I felt my body take form.    Here's what you can expect:   -Soreness. Everywhere. Which is why this DVD is amazing. In a short 20 minutes, she targets every area. My quads were sore. My arms. My hamstrings. My butt. And my calves were KILLING me. Going down stairs, I felt like crying.    The reviews on here say that new mothers that want to shed the baby weight find the 20 minutes the perfect way to squeeze it in. Let me tell you, I used to do 1 hour on the ellipictal and hadnt seen the same results as I have with her.    I'm still a beginner, so I havnt measured weight loss yet. But for once, I'm not obssessed with the number on the scale, and will just go by how my clothes fit and how good I feel. Because muscle weighs more than fat, I dont want the # to be higher than anticipated, causing a disappointment/relapse.     The fact that Jillian is selling this DVD for so cheap and for it to be this effective, makes a $500 / yr membership at a gym seem like such a scam.     Buy this DVD. Force yourself through it. You'll never look back.    **EDIT**  2 weeks later, I swear a see a six pack somewhere underneath that stubborn layer of fat. But most importantly, when I'm having a stressful day at work, or someone in my family gets on my nerves, i really look forward to my 20 minutes of intensity with Jillian because the exertion really does relieve stress (especially those squat/punch combos in Level 1 and Level 3).    I've only done Level 1 and Level 3 because I find some of the positions in Level 2 to be awkward. Either way, I always feel challenged. It's like the gift that keeps on giving.    **SECOND EDIT**  I brought this dvd with me when I went to visit 2 guy friends of mine who used to be in the army (2 rounds in afghanistan). When they saw me whip it out, they laughed and said \\"This is girly stuff.\\" These are very fit guys. Can you imagine my satisfaction where after 20 minutes of Level 3, they were DYING and sweating! Serves them right for doubting! In order to not get bored, I bought the other dvds \\"no more trouble zones\\" and the abs one. I figure if you keep your workouts fresh, you wont get bored and lose momentum. In two weeks, I've gone from a size 10 to a size 8. :)
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|I will preface my review by saying that, if you are one of the people that want to skip to the end of the book to find out what happens, this is NOT the film for you.  You will be bored because you actually have to pay attention because the story starts slowly and builds--it is not an 'instant gratification' type film.    Personally, I love 50's and 60's suspense type films like Rear Window.  This film is a tip of the cap to that genre.  I loved it!  I thought the story was interesting, the characters were well-developed, the scenery was beautiful, and the acting was flawless--a very sophisticated thriller.  There was suspense, dry humor, action and intrigue all wrapped up with beautiful people delivering the dialogue.    If you are a fan of Hitchcock-ian type thrillers, this is a great way to spend an afternoon.
1433524619|5.0|I just received my ESV personal size study Bible, and I could not be more impressed.  Being a seminary student at a major university's divinity school, the standard translation and study Bible most use is the NRSV.  I find that the overall ethos of the notes of the Harper-Collins Study Bible to be skeptical, and from the vein of scholarship that seriously doubts the truthfulness and authority of scripture, and that the NRSV is a translation that takes way too many liberties with the text in the name of gender inclusive language, rendering clearly masculine terms as neuter and pluralizing masculine singulars, taking away a lot of the personal language found in the Greek.  That being said the ESV Study Bible is the exact opposite.  The ESV translation is the best that I have found in terms of rendering the Greek accurately with still not being oblivious to some gender issues.  Also the notes and introductions are QUALITY.  The general position is one of trust and reverence for the text, and also the notes represent a broad theological spectrum from within the evangelical/reformed world.  This is the only evangelical Bible that I have found that pays close attention to the scholarly debates about authorship and other topics of Biblical books, and though obviously from a certain perspective (what text isn't?) the notes provide me with an alternate perspective to the more liberal NRSV Harper Collins Bible.  I am truly amazed that they have made a study Bible that can be read by your average lay-person and greatly expand their knowledge about the Bible, but also appeal to seminarians as well.  Further the personal size is GREAT!  My friend has the full size and it is quite a pain to carry, but the personal size is actually portable, and light.  This Bible is an essential addition to anyone's Bible collection!

0061537969|5.0|A friend recommended this book but, not being a sports fan, I was reluctant to read it, but I do love dogs.   The book is written from the dog's perspective which in itself, is entertaining.  It has very little to do with the sport of racing, and much more to do with the sport of living.  I find myself now looking at my own dog and wondering if she is thinking some of the things that Enzo thinks.  Very moving, sometimes fun, sometimes heart wrenching.  I would recommend this book to everyone!

B0024FADAQ|4.0|Hi There  Okay The Last Starfighter came out in the 80's and let's face it the 80's did have a few films especially sci-fi films that did have dodgy special effects and the Last Starfighter is no exception. All the special effects in the film are done using a computer and at times it looks a bit like a cartoon but on the plus side it's a really fun film. Discounting the effects the story and the acting is really good. Okay it's the kind of story you've seen or read before. Young kid gets taking into space to battle ultimate evil, but it's done in a slightly different way as the kid in question doesn't want to become a starfighter. Also while he's off in space a Beta unit (android) is taking his place on Earth with some really funny results. All in all if you haven't ever seen this film see it and enjoy it for all it's cheesy fun. And if you have seen the film in the 80's and liked it, then why haven't you got it in your collection. I would give this film 5 stars just because it's such a nice story but the computer effects do let it down a bit so hence the 4 star rating.

B004N66XYE|3.0|One the biggest Masterpiece Mysteries is why the producers released the new \\"Upstairs Downstairs\\" in the same season as \\"Downton Abbey\\" to which it simply cannot compare.<br /><br />The sets and constumes are elegant; the actors are excellent--Eileen Atkins as the Countess is superb; and Jean Marsh is her same delightful self as Rose, who is now the Housekeeper--but it is as if the producers/writers have crammed too many ideas into too short a time. Three not-quite one-hour episodes are not enough. The story is choppy. Instead of being developed, the characters have been served to us in a narrative shorthand: the brittle haughty wife; the nobly motivated husband; the perversely promiscuous sister; the equally promiscuous but good-hearted maid; the footman, who is a barking fascist in one episode but then, in the next episode, has a sudden unexplained change of heart. All have been set against a sketchy historical background of social and political problems of the '30s: the problem of members of the upper classes who supported the fascists; the problem of European refugees; the problem of what to do with mentally challenged relatives of the aristocracy; the problems of class and race.<br /><br />Various notable personages drift in and out of the house briefly: foreign minister Anthony Eden; German ambassador von Ribbentrop; Mrs. Simpson; the Duke of Kent (presumably Bertie was occupied in another film with his speech lessons); society photographer Cecil Beaton (in a scene with the cook that would have been delightful had it not been hastily imposed onto the narrative without much point). Furthermore, the historical element has been inserted into the story so perfunctorily that unless one is thoroughly familiar with it (as one should be, ideally), the viewer might wonder who this Anthony person is, who keeps bossing Lord Hallam about.<br /><br />There are lots of excellent possibilities in respect to this series, but they need to be developed over time: six or seven one-and-a-half hour episodes, are recommended.isodes, are recommended.

B004LWZVZC|5.0|The worst thing that ever happened to the South after the Civil War was the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Far from \\"vindicating the South and killing a tyrant\\" as John Wilkes Booth and the other conspirators planned, it brought a ten year reign of hellfire down upon the South. Lincoln would doubtless have preferred \\"malice toward none and charity for all\\" but his death visited a decade of \\"Reconstruction\\" suffering upon the South, including the disenfranchisement of all who fought for the Confederacy from vindictive Republicans and Northern veterans who wanted punishment not mercy. Reconstruction poisoned race relations in the South for 100 years, but that's not a topic here. The assassination was the pivotal event that started it all.<br /><br />There were a number of conspirators, John Booth, John Sarratt, etc, and one, Mary Sarratt for whom there has never been any evidence that she conspired with the others. She owned and operated a boarding house on \\"H\\" St in Washington where the other conspirators met, but had no knowledge of their plans. Nevertheless there was a witch hunt by the military and the Republicans after the assassination, who saw more such rebellions lurking under each bridge and dark shadow. The military tribunal had reached the conclusion that all would hang before the \\"trials\\" started, most deservedly, but not Mary Sarratt. Seward, one if the targets of the conspirators, who was not killed in the assassination attempts, seems particularly motivated to see her hang.<br /><br />Her lawyer tried to defend her, question the \\"evidence\\", even gets a writ of habeas corpus to try her in a civilian court.<br /><br />Robert Redford's movie is a tense courtroom drama, all shot authentic with available light and gaslight. Excellent acting from Robin Penn Wright as tragic Mary Sarratt, and James McAvoy as her young idealistic Northern lawyer and Yankee war veteran who nevertheless believes in her right to a fair trial.<br /><br />a lesson in American history not usually taught in schools.<br />High recommendationshools.  High recommendations

0316098337|5.0|Out of the mouth of babes.  This touching novel is chock full of blissfully clear un-jaded nuggets of wisdom that only a child raised in captivity could see.  A true reminder of the gift of life and the power of love.  Highly recommend.
0755322800|5.0|I'm certain the synopsis will do the job describing the storyline and plot details, so I'll do none of that here.  All I will advise you to do is pick up this book as fast as you possibly can.  Neil Gaiman is one of the most gifted storytellers of this or any generation. I would also recommend AMERICAN GODS, also by Mr. Gaiman.
B0015DROBO|2.0|the plot is interesting and i really wanted to like it.  but the unnecessarily graphic rape scenes did much more harm than good.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|If you have not seen this classic swashbuckler except in the chopped up versions commonly seen in TV broadcasts, you really have not seen it. I was surprised the first time I watched this Blu-ray to see scenes I had never seen before, despite watching the movie countless times on television over the years. The other major surprise is the color, which is eye-popping in this restored version. Early color movies such as this one went for color in a big way and man is this one colorful. Again, most TV versions are faded and bear absolutely no resemblence to the original. Some might even argue that the colors are overdone and garish. But you have to understand the context of the movie. Early color TV shows suffered from the same issue. Color was new then so they wanted to give you COLOR. And man, they did. The vivid color palette used in this movie is just amazing. Of course, the movie itself is a joy, perhaps the best Robin Hood ever. No one can beat Errol Flynn in the title role and there is no better villain than Basil Rathbone. Add in marvelous cinematography  (the shift between the actual characters and their shadows in the climactic swordfight is classic) and a wonderful score and you get one the best classic action movies of all time.
B003405MF6|4.0|It was by  listening to \\"Blue wind\\" and \\"Wired\\" by this young self-deprecating gentleman that got me started on jazz  As part of the same defjam I also heard \\"Kind of blue\\" by Miles Davis and heard \\"Tribute to Jack John  Johnson\\" and \\"Bitches Brew\\" by Miles Davis, and \\"Heavy Weather\\" by Weather Report shortly afterwards which is another story by which some tackle.  This is a revelation that does not involve black holes, if I muse on it.  After a gentle beginning, Jeff outs his foot down and the rest of the album is, by turns, pastoral and bluesy, with and without lush arrangements with guest vocalists tastefully deployed on the field.  For a man his age, who announced the start of his life as a solo artiste by throwing an amp through the window of a Texas club, Jeff proves once more that he can make the mustard walk and talk.  A superb recording and more than a credit to him, but does not have the impact o the first two albums of his that I heard in terms of setting a dramatically new paradigm.  Jeff is still the architect and still making new plans! He says,\\" I am El Becko!  Hear my roar!\\"
B004L49K20|4.0|...but now I can't get several of the songs out of my head.  Being a fan since I was 11 years old, I was a little afraid to listen since the last album was such a disappointment to me.  All in all, I am enjoying this one and hope that others get to listen to it as well.  I am not sure why they released the title track first as there are others that are much more catchy and radio friendly.  I'd say \\"Girl Panic!\\", \\"The Man Who Stole a Leopard (minus the \\"news\\" cast at the end)\\", \\"Runway Runaway\\" and \\"Before the Rain\\" are my favorites so far but most of the rest are catchy as well.  Altogether a solid album.  I am not disappointed.
B004G600A4|3.0|Pros: 1. Animation: really superb. Some of the locales in the movie (eg. Rampunzel's tower, the Castle and surrounding town)<br />  will take your breath away.<br />  2. Humor: Humor for the most part is a success. A lot of the humor is very cliche -- you've seen it all before in Disney features.<br />  There are several jokes that are work, however, and they are quite memorable.<br /><br />Cons: 1. Pacing: story really drags in a lot of places, and this ultimately the downfall of the movie. Every time the lead character would break into YET<br />  ANOTHER musical, I would cringe. Story would have been much served being a fast-paced action adventure with a lot of humor interspersed (like an<br />  Aladdin).<br />  2. Weak forgettable characters: I like the lead character of Rampunzel, and the villaness. The other characters were totally forgettable -- the<br />  various sidekicks (eg. the iguana and the horse Maximus), inserted for comic relief, were actually for the most part annoying rather than<br />  humorous.<br /><br />Conclusion: worth a single viewing to see the amazing animation, but its ultimately not a keeper -- rent it dont buy it.
B004G600A4|5.0|We didn't see this movie at the movie theater because I just gave birth to my little boy so I have to bought it. I'm so glad I did!!! This movie is so funny and my daughter LOVES IT. It's a great story with a great end. I love the music, the songs and the characters. It's great!!
B004G6009U|5.0|I saw this movie (in 3D) in the theater with my 6 yo grandson.  He loved it.  I bought the Blu-Ray/DVD Combo and he is able to watch on Playstation 3 with Blu-Ray and in his portable DVD player with the included DVD.  Great movie.  High Quality discs.
B00009PAKO|5.0|I remember seeing this movie years ago when I was a young teenager.....Cant remember exactly how I got a hold of it but never the less I do remember seeing it...I forgot about the movie over the years until recently when the new version came out starring Sarah Butler as Jennifer Hills ( I Spit On Your Grave )....Instantly I ordered the new version on cable and absolutely loved it..Call me sick but the movie is about the ultimate revenge from a woman who has been raped by four men and left for dead....I love the fact that she got her dignity back and self satisfaction for torturing her abusers..I cant imagine what it would do to me emotionally or physically if I were ever assaulted in the way this woman was, but I can imagine if I were, I would want the kind of revenge she gave her perpetrators...    After watching the newer movie I immediately went on line and searched for the original version of I Spit On You Grave and purchased it and this version even though is the original version, by no means is the more realistic and believable version..I would recommend both movies as they both offer complete interest and nonstop entense scenes...Definitely a must see
B003ZHQVJO|4.0|This CD is different from any of Kid Rock's past endeavors.  This one has a more mellow, grass-roots feel from the first through the last track.  None are laced with hip-hop or rap, and none are filled with profanity you'd be embarrassed for your granny to hear.  But, surprisingly, this CD is nice to put on and just cruise down the road.  There are lots of catchy lyrics, great music, and lots of talent put into this CD.  Even though it has a more relaxed overall tone, it still keeps your attention and keeps you moving to the beat.    Buy this if you like his tunes with Sheryl Crow, or other mellow tunes that he has turned out in the past.  If you only like his raw, wild, and outlandish tunes and lyrics, this is not the disc for you.  I like his work on all ends of the spectrum, and this one fits into several of my play lists - regardless of who else is listening with me.
006112429X|5.0|Shriver's novel is a brilliant tale that sparks endless jolts of raw emotion. \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" is one of those books that becomes a roller coaster of a ride where you are able to feel every twist and turn igniting sensations of peril, exhilaration, joy, triumph and defeat. This read was a definitive page-turner that kept me on the edge of my seat longing to discover what would happen next. When the ride inevitably comes to a screeching halt, you will stay there, awestruck as you clasp the book in your hands feeling for the turbulent life of the protagonist Eva as if you knew her personally. A tragic and disturbing story that will forever imprint ghastly images, but will be remembered for its brutal honesty and uncanny realism. A must read!
091581112X|5.0|I have re-read this book (and affirmations)over and over throughout the past few years! Thoughts really ARE things so, why not program yours to be be used to your advantage? So much if what we see, hear and feel on a daily basis is negative. This book is full of important but simple and positive ideas that all of us could stand to be reminded of often.
B002ZG99IG|1.0|Cause this film has received some stellar reviews that are completely unrealistic. The movie and performances were sub-par at best without no question. I gave this movie one star and thats out of generosity. You might as well watch the original film \\"Single white Female\\". It was more raw and realistic and had alot more sexuality too it. This movie was like a G version of that movie and a Imposter. And as Bad as Single White Female 2 was it was a Emmy winner compared to this. At least it wasn't posing to be another movie like this one is. I'm  not sure why this was released in a movie theater? This is very much straight to video quality at best. No big names? No familiar faces? No original plot and No great acting? Billy Zane hasn't been a relevant actor sense The TITANIC. So the director obviously knew someone or pulled some strings for this one. Move on people theirs nothing here to see new or innovative.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|Add one more to the count of people who won't be buying this without the original theatrical releases.  The more time goes by, the more it is becoming readily apparent Mr. Lucas just got lucky with the original trilogy.  It says a lot about someone's ego to spit in the face of all his fans for 15+ years.  What a schmuck.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Actors in this show are ALL amazing!  The story line never seems to get old and Dexter always finds a way to not get caught.  And just when you think you might know how an episode, or a season, might end, it ends differently than you could have guessed.    The writers of this show are so talented! I can't wait for each new episode and I purchase every season.

I think it's a great value and I'd recommend it to anyone who cares about sound quality.  The ath-m50 paired with the E7 sounds considerably better than the new hip-hop artist inspired headphone setups, not to mention it's a bit cheaper.  No regrets with the E7, it's exactly what I expected when I ordered it.
1849460752|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moDKWB47ZKZ40D]]ON IMMIGRATION AND ASYLUM ACROSS EUROPE!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Can there ever be one legislative framework for immigration and asylum across the European Union - instead of the present situation in which each member state evolves and enforces its own? That's the aim and a partial answer to this question... or at least a monumental effort in that direction which is provided by a recent publication from Hart Publishing and Verlag C.H. Beck who have published Kay Hailbronner's excellent book.<br /><br />In our view, `EU Immigration and Asylum Law' offers erudite commentary on EU Regulations and Directives pertaining to immigration and asylum law from a knowledgeable team of contributors.  Based at the Centre for International and European Law on Immigration and Asylum at the University of Konstanz, Germany, the editor, Hailbronner, has compiled a formidable work of reference which examines both intensively and extensively the content of existing European legislation on asylum and immigration, with a view to identifying potential interpretation issues and their application. Inevitably, individual members of such a diverse team will reveal differing views on overlapping issues generated by this complex subject - but a diversity of opinion is generally a good thing.<br /><br />The overall objective  here is to work painstakingly toward what the editor refers to as a  `full(y) fledged harmonization' which, it is to be hoped, will lead to a common European asylum and immigration policy.  If such an object is ever achieved, it would replace the present uncertain scheme of things in which each European member state continues to evolve its own minimum standards, options and discretionary policies on asylum and immigration.<br /><br />The purpose of this heavyweight volume is to assist courts, administrative authorities and other relevant civil institutions across Europe -- including immigration tribunals - to enhance and augment their understanding of existing European legislation, much of which after all, incorporates many of the laws and practices already in place in individual European member states. Hart Publishing is to be commended for this important new title to its catalogue which brings a deeper, erudite understanding to EU asylum and immigration issues.<br /><br />This is a thorough and methodically laid out work of reference of over 1,500 pages, on an often complex and vexed subject area.  A number of key pieces of European legislation are dealt with in detail, including directives on, for example, the qualification and status of refugees...asylum procedure...the admission of students...the admission of researchers... the return of third-country (non-European) nationals...and much more besides.<br /><br />`EU Immigration and Asylum Law' would certainly be an ideal acquisition for the in-house libraries of any institutions or individuals dealing with immigration and asylum in the EU, from immigration departments and NGOs, to practicing lawyers, students and academics in this field.  The general bibliography is itself an extremely useful research resource.unals - to enhance and augment their understanding of existing European legislation, much of which after all, incorporates many of the laws and practices already in place in individual European member states.

B003PIUBZS|2.0|I am only writing this review as a warning to parents. Surely you already know that there is violence, blood and carnage in this series, but before you buy it to watch with your family, you should also be aware that there is so much nudity and explicit sex that it must be labeled \\"softcore pornography\\".

B0000019PA|5.0|The first time I heard this album many years ago I could not get my arms around it and found it deliberately obtuse.  Coming back to it 15 years later, I was deeply moved by much of what I found.  Strange and wonderful in many places, just strange in others.

The music is excellent and the lyrics are superb to go with it.   Very excited to see them play this year at Bonnaroo!  If you don't have this album, it is an absolute must buy!
B0037N6XR6|4.0|I made the big mistake of reading the book series before watching the TV series. I am a stickler for details, and we all know TV shows and movies don't always stick to EVERY detail their based-on books have (or don't have).<br />But aside from that, this is deffinitely worth watching. If not for the funny expressions from Sookie or Tarra, then because watching someone like Alexander Skarsgard play Eric Northman is just too... Yummy... to pass up. Honest. And blond isn't even my type.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|This was in PERFECT condition, there was nothing wrong with it at all, and it got here fairly quickly. I will order from this here again.
076115678X|5.0|I have never seen a book like this before. It has solved many problems I have had over the years of what to do with my extremely curly, extremely thick hair. The DVD is very helpful also. Recommends many simple, inexpensive and easy-to-use things I had never thought about regarding washing and styling this type of hair. I love it!
0307704610|3.0|I bought this audio book because I was curious about the 5 minute female orgasm honestly. I am happy to see a man so committed to making us ladies happy. I will share it discretely with my honey (maybe just give him that cd ;o). As far as the information on nutrition if you are exactly like Tim Ferriss I beat it will work for ya. If you are not, it likely will not. If you eat a ton of processed food and do not like to exercise you will likely increase your muscle mass or at least your body mass and maybe drop some fat but it is far from a healthy balanced diet. From an Ayurvedic perspective it is based in building foods and if you are a Male Vatta-Pitta like Tim Ferris it will sort of work but it can not be done for a long time with out adverse effects long term. Down the line he may retract some of his statements after further investigation and experience. Of course if you are thinking of slicing yourself open to staple your stomach or get some kind of plastic surgery this is a better alternative. Oh well, the chapter about his devotion to experimenting with the female orgasm on as many test subjects as possible was pretty amusing.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|I liked this film even tho hard to follow at times.  Requires a lot of concentration.  It is not always easy to keep track of who is on what side, etc.  Even so, it was interesting and at times riveting.

B001S86J5S|5.0|A comedic view of major league baseball.   The Cleveland Indians are in last place, and the new owner wants them to loose, so she can relocate the team to a different city. Without revealing the details of the movie, a team of misfits gel together to win their division. The antics of the players, including some romance provides a setting that both males and females can enjoy! My favorite scene was when Charley Sheen came out of the bull pen, with thousands of fans screaming \\"Wild Thing\\".  JTB
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I've mounted a Viewsonic VX2233 (21.5\\" widescreen) monitor; seems to hold up just fine.  The friction of the joints are a little stiff... I'm afraid of it wearing under continous motion.    The mounting clamp is easily installed, but the bracketing for the monitor could use a redesign for quick-connecting. Currently, it's either you secure the arm on the monitor and mount the arm/monitor together on the desk... or you mount the arm and attempt to secure the monitor to the arm. Risky without a second pair of hands, either way.    Overall. Good buy.
B004FQX5CK|4.0|I first saw this movie at the cinema when it came out in the early 1980's. I remember it as being a very unusual movie then,but not as unusual now with the changes in themes, and in movie technology.   Harrison Ford stars as a \\"Blade Runner\\"(a cop) whose job is to track down escapees from an outer space colony. These escapees were not engineered to function on earth, and are dangerous socio-paths. The format I ordered is in blu-ray. and provided excellent viewing with the bright colors!  JTB
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|Iv'e been an R.E.M. nut since 1984. Of all the albums they've put out since then this has got to be the most disapointing. Maybe I was expecting too much. After reading a few reviews before I got the album I hoping for a new, inventive R.E.M. masterpiece.....instead I got a fairly bland collection of seeming throwoffs.  Where are the monster hooks? The subtle melodic transitions?   If I didn't know better I'd say this was an album made to fill out a contract with the record company and no real effort was put into it.

The Way We Were is one I have never seen but I find Barbra Streisand to be a very fascinating character in all of her movies.  I use to only view her as a singer but she is quite the actress and producer as well.  She is a gem to treasure.  This triple feature is priceless.

1936719010|5.0|Steven Pressfield gets the creative process - the inspiration that gets us started, the obstacles we must overcome along the way, the fear that threatens to prevent us from ever finishing. And in Do the Work, he shares his wisdom and guides us through beginning, middle, and end with powerful metaphors, straight talk, and no tolerance for quitting. If you feel compelled to realize your vision, if you want to build a new rollercoaster instead of just going along for the ride, you will be grateful to have Pressfield sitting on your shoulder as you do your work, whispering, warning, kicking, cajoling, shouting when resistance rears its ugly head, reminding you that you have a sword with which to slay the dragon, and celebrating with you when you've finally finished, before mentioning that it's time to start the next project!
B000P0J09M|3.0|This is probably my husbands favorite move of all time so I was excited to get it for him for christmas. However the format on it is not the most user friendly the scene menu is not organized at all, and you have to flip the disk over halfway through the movie in order to finish it, but again it doesnt line up exactly where it is supposed to with the change over. Overall I am disappointed with the disk and will most likely end up buying him a second copy of this movie.
1589949811|5.0|* So what exactly is this game?<br />The Lord of the Rings: The Card game is the latest LCG (Living Card Game), to be released by the publisher Fantasy Flight Games, as of April 20th, 2011. This game can be played by up to 2-4 players cooperatively, but also makes for a satisfying solitaire experience if you don't have any friends handy, would like to experiment with deck construction, or simply opt to play alone. This product is the very first release in this exciting new series, and represents the base game that will be required to play any of the future expansions currently planned for development and release on an approximately monthly basis.<br /><br />NOTE: If you are planning on playing this game exclusively alone, you should keep in mind that only the first of the three scenarios included within this box set is generally considered by the fanbase to be properly balanced for one player, and that from my personal experience, I think that this game seems to provide the best balance between challenge and sheer entertainment value when played with two players. With each player beyond the first, the general consensus seems to be that the game becomes less difficult overall, although it nevertheless remains a challenge throughout.<br /><br />* What does this Core set come with?<br />The Lord of the Rings LCG Core set comes with 226 cards, separated into three different types of decks:<br /><br />1) The Player Decks (of which there are four included in this Core set), are composed of a total of 116 cards from 4 different \\"Spheres of Influence,\\" or factions (think colors of Mana, a la Magic: the Gathering). Also included are 4 copies of one Character card not belonging to any specific \\"Sphere\\" or faction, and when put together, 29 \\"Sphere\\" cards + 1 neutral card = 30 cards in each of the 4 pre-constructed Player Decks. These decks, regardless of \\"Sphere,\\" are all composed of Allies (supporting characters), Attachments (weapons, items, or character enhancements), and Events (one-time effects and interrupts). These, along with 12 unique Hero cards (3 per Sphere), make up the pool of cards that players can draw from and use to construct any deck they would like to design to play in whatever game scenario they decide to pit themselves against. Each of the different Spheres of Influence can be mixed or matched with one another at each player's preference, and each Sphere of Influence has its own strong and weak points, working most effectively when paired with other Spheres that complement its strengths and compensate for its weaknesses. The four Spheres and some (not all), of their strong points are: Tactics (focused on offensive combat, damage avoidance and assisting other players with their own attacks), Leadership (with a focus on defensive combat, protecting other players, character buffs and resource generation), Spirit (focused on location exploration, cancellation effects, quest completion and Threat reduction), and Lore (with a focus on healing, card draw, Enemy control and Threat mitigation).<br /><br />2) The Encounter Decks, which represent the \\"opponent\\" mechanism that the players are set against in each scenario, are made up of a total of 84 cards divided among several different card types, namely Enemies (monsters and evil characters), Treacheries (instant, punishing effects), and Locations (cards that have detrimental effects until discarded through the process of exploration). These cards are all grouped into seven different themed \\"Encounter Sets,\\" for example, \\"Orcs of Dol Guldur,\\" or \\"Spiders of Mirkwood.\\" For each of the three playable scenarios that are included within the Core set, a different combination of these Encounter Sets is specified to be used to compose each quest's unique Encounter Deck. To illustrate this concept, while players do not encounter any \\"Spiders of Mirkwood\\" cards in the Journey Down the Anduin scenario, they will face them in the Passage Through Mirkwood quest, whereas cards from the \\"Orcs of Dol Guldur\\" Encounter Set will see use in both of these scenarios. I think that this is a very imaginative way to make each individual scenario a distinct, unique experience that nevertheless fits with all of the others. Though all three quests are initially set up in a very precise, specific way at the start of each game, there is always an unpredictable element in regard to which Encounter cards will be drawn and revealed for the players to contend with (and when), during each game. Additionally, during combat, each Enemy is dealt a card at random from the Encounter Deck which, when revealed, may have no effect whatsoever (if the players are lucky), but nevertheless has a fair chance to either somehow empower the Enemy or otherwise harm the players. This \\"shadow effect\\" can take a variety of forms, but often significantly bolsters an Enemy's attack strength or either triggers some other undesirable effect that could result in an unfavorable, unpredicted, punishing outcome and potentially turn the tide of the game against the players. This element of unpredictability adds a level of strategy to the game that I find extraordinarily engaging, and prevents combat and gameplay from ever becoming stale, predictable or overly simple, making sure that the players treat even the weakest adversaries at times with great caution, lest they be unpleasantly surprised and suffer unexpected losses or other adverse effects.<br /><br />3) The Quest Decks (of which there are three included in this Core set), are composed of a total of 10 double-sided, sequential cards that lead the players through each of the three unique scenarios and specify different events that occur in each of the different phases of every quest. For example, upon completion of the first phase of a scenario and immediately revealing the next quest card in sequence, this new card may require the players to search the Encounter Deck and put a particular Enemy or Location into play, or instead introduce an unfavorable modification to the normal game rules until that quest phase is completed. Each new quest card also specifies novel objectives for continuing to progress toward eventually winning the scenario, and the final card of every Quest Deck always explains the unique conditions of victory for that game (which can sometimes vary even within the same scenario, due to branching paths of progression).<br /><br />Additionally, every Core set also comes with a multitude of high quality cardboard tokens to represent 1) damage inflicted upon Characters and Enemies, 2) progress made toward completing quests or exploring locations, and 3) the resources available to every player's Heroes, which are used to play Allies, Events, and Attachments that match that Heroes' Sphere of Influence icon (or neutral cards). Further, this set includes one large \\"First Player Token\\" to signify which player acts first in each phase (which rotates clockwise after every full game round has passed), and also comes with two very handsome \\"Threat Dials\\" for players to keep track of their current level of \\"Threat\\" in a more dignified way than simply writing numbers on a piece of paper or tediously changing numbers on a pair of dice. This concept of \\"Threat\\" serves a variety of different purposes in the game, and although it primarily exists as something that players cannot help but to accumulate, it is a value that they nevertheless strive to reduce and minimize. First and foremost, during any scenario, if a player's Threat level ever reaches a certain value (50), that player is immediately eliminated from the game. Secondly, this unique mechanic also determines whether players have the option of choosing if and when to engage opposing Enemies in combat, or if they will instead have battle forced upon them, whether they are prepared to handle the onslaught or not. For example, if players want to bide their time to better outfit their Characters before contending with any Enemies, they may wantto delay combat for several rounds while they prepare; however, if their Threat climbs high enough, they will be left with no choice but to confront their foes immediately, as each Enemy has an \\"engagement threshold\\" for attacking the players that, when met, means it is forced to enter combat with the offending player as soon as possible. Finally, as a third function, keeping track of Threat also serves to give the players a \\"score\\" upon winning a scenario so that they can attempt to either compare their performance between successive plays of the same quest, or the relative efficacy of different decks at completing the same scenario.<br /><br />* So what does the game actually play like?<br />At the beginning of every game, each player selects 1-3 Heroes, and then constructs a deck of 50 or more cards made up of the Attachments, Allies and Event cards of their choice corresponding to the Sphere of Influence icons that match those of the Heroes that they decided to use. Every Hero has a different starting level of Threat that is added to its controller's Threat Dial at the beginning of each game, and this usually means that the player that selected the strongest Heroes to play with also begins with the highest level of Threat; as a result, this player must typically contend with the most attention and harassment from the Encounter Deck, which can be painfully unmerciful at times. It is important for prospective players to keep in mind that the Core set only includes enough cards to make a 30-card deck for each of the 4 different Spheres of Influence, so with only one Core set the 50 or more card requirement in order to create a \\"tournament-legal\\" deck is only attainable through playing decks composed of cards from two or more Spheres (of course, there's nothing wrong with just using a 30 card, single-Sphere deck to play the game, but should a player decide to purchase several expansion packs and/or 1-2 additional copies of the Core set, constructing a 50 or more card single-Sphere deck becomes entirely possible). Finally, the players must agree on which scenario to play, and then set up the game according to how the scenario's corresponding quest cards tell the players to do so. The game itself progresses in sequential phases that together compose each full round of the game, with players taking turns back and forth, and at times acting simultaneously. During each game round, players move through seven different phases, during which they will:<br /><br />- Gather resources and draw cards<br />- Acquire Allies (supporting characters), and strengthen their existing forces through playing Attachments (weapons, items, and other \\"permanent\\" character enhancements)<br />- Play Event cards that trigger one-time beneficial effects, such as healing, gaining extra character actions, or preventing enemies from using their abilities<br />- Combat vicious enemies that actively seek to destroy the most threatening players first, many of which have unique and dangerous abilities to contend with<br />- Attempt to make progress within and eventually complete the chosen scenario by \\"questing,\\" the mechanism by which players move through each successive phase of a given scenario, and also how they attempt to explore and overcome dangerous and threatening Locations that serve to hinder the players and impede their progress<br /><br />During the Quest Phase of each round, every player selects any number of his or her Characters and expends their available action that round in attempt to make progress toward completing the current quest phase of the chosen scenario. After players have chosen how many Characters they are willing to \\"commit\\" to questing, one Encounter card per player is revealed from the Encounter Deck and added to the \\"Staging Area,\\" joining any existing Encounter cards already in play there. To resolve the players' attempt at questing, the \\"Willpower\\" value of all committed Characters is combined and compared to the totaled \\"Threat\\" value of all of the Encounter cards currently residing in the Staging Area. If the players' total Willpower is higher, they place a number of progress tokens equal to the difference between the two values on the current quest card (or the \\"active\\" Location, if there is one, as that acts as a protective buffer to the Quest Deck until it has absorbed its maximum allotment of progress tokens and is subsequently discarded); however, if the total Threat value is higher, every player must instead increase their Threat Dial by the difference, and no progress tokens are placed on the current quest or active Location, representing a \\"failed\\" quest. The Staging Area is a rather unique concept in this game, as it is a place on the table where cards revealed from the Encounter Deck essentially \\"lay in wait\\" to be dealt with by the players at their own choosing (for the most part). The players are, however, given significant incentive to attempt to clear out the Staging Area; if too many Encounter cards are left to remain and accumulate there, their combined Threat value will eventually become so much higher than the players' total Willpower that it could potentially raise each player's Threat to an unmanageable level, and remember, if a player's Threat value ever reaches 50, that player is immediately eliminated from the game, making victory likely to be far more difficult for any surviving players to achieve.<br /><br />While any Location cards revealed from the Encounter Deck are content to merely sit and wait in the Staging Area until players choose to travel to them (which has the effect of making the selected Location \\"active,\\" transforming it into a protective buffer for the current quest card), depending on each player's level of Threat during the Engagement Phase, any Enemy cards laying in wait may actively leave the Staging Area and seek the players out, forcing them to engage in combat whether they want to or not, or have any hope of surviving. During each game, if a player's Threat ever becomes too high, they may find themselves with frustratingly little control over which (or how many!), Enemies engage them in combat, and this can definitely make for a very challenging, but ultimately rewarding experience. For example, if a player has a current Threat rating of 20, a Forest Spider with an engagement cost of 25 won't look twice at them, and will simply sit in the Staging Area until a player becomes more threatening. While it will continue to contribute its Threat value against the players' Willpower during the Quest Phase (until it leaves play or is removed from the Staging Area), during the Engagement Phase it will simply stay put unless a player chooses to optionally engage it in combat (at the beginning of each Engagement Phase, all players have the option of forcing one Enemy in the Staging Area to immediately engage with them, should they choose to do so). However, if at any point a player acquires a Threat rating of 25 or more, instead of giving them any option, during the next Engagement Phase the Forest Spider will immediately leave the Staging Area of its own volition and proceed to attack that player's Heroes and Allies. Although Enemies engaged in combat with a player suddenly become a direct risk to his or her Characters, they fortunately no longer continue to contribute their Threat value against the players' combined Willpower during the Quest Phase, and likewise, while a Location is \\"active,\\" although it does begin acting as a protective buffer for the Quest Deck, it too no longer contributes it's Threat rating against the players' Willpower. Regardless of how many Encounter cards remain in the Staging Area, however, during the final phase of every game round each player must always increase their Threat Dial by 1, moving them ever closer to inevitable defeat unless they are able to complete the scenario in a timely fashion (or otherwise take advantage of a variety of card effects in order to reduce their Threat and buy them more time).<br /><br />By default, each Character only possesses one action per round, which they may expend to either quest, defend, attack, or in some cases, activate special abilities. Unless they benefit from various card effects to give them additional actions, this limitation leads to players having to frequently weigh the risks and benefits of committing their Characters to carrying out different functions necessary to complete the scenario; however, by merit of covering themselves on one front, players could potentially be leaving themselves vulnerable on another. For example, by choosing to defend against an attacking Enemy, their Heroes or Allies may not suffer any damage this phase, but neither will their Characters be able to attack in return and rid them of that Enemy, leaving it alive to continue harassing them round after round until it is finally dealt with. Given how quickly that Encounter cards can add up and at times become utterly overwhelming, decisions like this are demanded of the players during almost every phase of each full game round. Do the players try to spend their actions in order to explore dangerous Locations and remove them from play, or should they instead focus on destroying the Enemies directly engaging them in combat before their defenses are overwhelmed and their Characters killed? Or, do the players opt to help lessen the increasingly burdensome strain on one another, as opposed to spending their available actions and resources to contend with their own threats? I have found that this game contains an engaging, but not overwhelming demand for strategy and planning, and for a game that pits the players against a deck that plays itself, without any conscious decision-making from a sentient opponent, it provides a fantastic challenge that at times has really left me having to think hard to figure out how I could possibly manage to save myself or another player from either losing Characters or being eliminated outright after making some poor decisions or revealing a particularly nasty Encounter card or shadow effect. Gameplay continues until every player has been eliminated from the game (from their Threat reaching a value of 50, or having all of their Heroes killed), or until at least one player survives to see the requirements of the final quest card of the chosen scenario fulfilled.<br /><br />* So what exactly is a Living Card Game?<br />For those of you that have not heard of this concept before, an LCG differs from the traditional Collectible Card Game format (think Magic: The Gathering, World of Warcraft, etc), in that the contents of every box or booster pack of the same name will be identical in every way; that is to say, every copy of the LOTR LCG Core set will contain the exact same distribution of cards as any other Core set, and contents will not vary in the slightest between boxes. In this way, there is essentially no \\"rare chasing,\\" so players will never find themselves buying boxes of decks or booster packs hoping to get that one-in-a-million, golden-double-reverse-holofoil-promotional card that someone can buy online as a single for some outlandish price. Additionally, the \\"living\\" component refers to the notion that each month, an expansion to the Core game will be released in the form of an \\"Adventure Pack.\\" All of these Adventure Packs will contain 60 cards, divided amongst 1 new Hero for one of the four Spheres of Influence, 3 copies of 9 brand new cards for players to consider adding to their various decks, as well as the Quest Deck for a new scenario (typically 3-4 cards); any remaining cards (26 or so), will be used to help construct a new Encounter Deck for players to pit themselves against in the new Adventure Pack's included quest. These Adventure Packs will be separated into 6-month \\"cycles\\" of 6 releases each that all share a common theme and/or take place within the same region(s) of Middle-Earth, and in addition, we will also see the release of bi-annual \\"Deluxe\\" expansion boxes, which are meant to serve as larger expansions to kick off or supplement each new cycle or block of Adventure Packs. The very first of these Adventure Packs is named \\"The Hunt for Gollum,\\" which is the first release of the \\"Shadows of Mirkwood\\" cycle.<br /><br />* Wow, it sounds like I could save a ton of money by playing an LCG. Is there a catch?<br />According to the existing LOTR LCG rules, every player can include up to 3 copies of any non-Hero card in their \\"tournament-legal\\" deck. In many ways this is great, as the Adventure Packs will contain exactly 3 copies of each new player card they introduce, and the Deluxe expansions have been confirmed to follow suit; this means that if you buy just one copy of every future release, you will most likely have enough copies of any cards you could possibly want in order to suit all of your deck building needs, without any reason to chase rares or singles, and eliminating any reason whatsoever to order entire boxes of booster packs at a time, only to receive hundreds of copies of the same useless common cards for your money and never getting that elusive rare that you were really hoping for. HOWEVER, instead of containing 3 copies of each non-Hero card, the Core set (this product), only has 1 or 2 copies of a large number of player cards, which, for the truly hardcore player (or people with issues, such as myself), may necessitate the purchase of up to THREE Core sets if they want to have at least 3 copies of every card and therefore \\"unlimited\\" deck construction options; keep in mind, though, that this would still only mean unlimited options for ONE player, but that this could indeed be easily expanded to accommodate 2-4 if the players restrict themselves to only building decks using different Spheres of Influence. While this is frustratingly unfortunate (and expensive), this will hopefully not remain a problem with any future releases. What this all boils down to is that if you are anything like me, and you end up enjoying this game immensely, you're going to have to ask yourself if it's worth shelling out the cash for 1-2 additional copies of the Core set in order to put your mind at ease and to allow you unrestricted deck construction options. Of course, you can simply play the game with just one Core set, but you will have to live without having the maximum number of copies of some of the most powerful player cards at your disposal. If you can live with that knowledge hanging over you, then you certainly have much greater willpower than I do!<br /><br />I did end up deciding it was worth it to me to pick up another two Core sets after my first, as I've been having an absolute blast playing this game so far and I plan on most often playing with just one other person, with each of us running decks using cards from two different Spheres of Influence each; this way, both of us can pick up to 3 copies of whatever cards we want, and the only potential problem down the line with any future releases may be figuring out who gets first dibs on any neutral cards (since players will still only get 3 copies of each new neutral card per purchase, players may have to fight over these unless they decide to buy multiple copies of specific expansions). At this point in the game's development, however, this isn't a problem, and the Core set specifically includes 4 copies of its only neutral card (and buying 3 Core sets would mean 12 copies, 3 for each of up to 4 players to include in their decks). Still, the monthly Adventure Packs do contain several neutral cards and Characters, any of which may eventually cause some controversy (possibly necessitating multiple purchases), depending upon their utility and popularity. The only neutral card included in the Core set, Gandalf, is inarguably one of the strongest Allies in the game, and if future neutral cards end up being similarly powerful, the pressure to purchase multiple copies of specific future releases could quickly become frustrating.<br /><br />* Hmm. Are there any other gripes people seem to have with this game?<br />I can only think of one other problem that comes immediately to mind; if you do decide to buy a copy of the Core set, you should be prepared to think up of your own way to conveniently organize and safely store all of the cards, tokens and trackers that come with it. The actual box that all of the pieces come packaged in only contains a cardboard insert that is rather useless for the purpose of attempting to organize anything, as if you were to simply put all the cards and tokens in stacks or piles in the box, they would slide around and become a jumbled mess with even the slightest jostling. I'm not exactly sure how FFG intended for us to use the cardboard insert to organize anything (if at all), but I went ahead and simply threw mine away. Planning ahead, and wanting to have plenty of room to accommodate cards from future expansions, I ended up deciding to order a bunch of different Ultra-Pro Deck Boxes that are color-coded to match the four Spheres of Influence (Leadership is purple, Tactics is red, Lore is light green, and Spirit is light blue), and I also ordered a white box for neutral and quest cards, a couple black boxes for Encounter cards, and some other colors to store custom player decks (these usually combine cards from 2-3 different Spheres). I also took the liberty of storing the wound, progress and resource tokens in separate, small-size Ultra-Pro transparent acrylic cases, and at the moment just have my Threat Dials and the First Player Token packed loosely into the box wherever I can fit them. All of these components seem to fit well enough into the box that the Core set comes packaged in, and so far it appears to be a convenient, sturdy way to transport and store everything. Although the game box itself is awfully full at the moment, when I do end up needing to add even more deck boxes in the future, they could be made to fit simply by turning the majority of them onto their side instead of having them lay on their backs, which frees up quite a bit of room while still allowing the game box to be sealed completely when I replace the top. I'm sure that eventually I'll have to find some alternative means of storing the cards from the Core set and countless monthly and Deluxe expansions, but for the time being, this method seems to work just fine.<br /><br />* Any final thoughts?<br />All in all, this was an awfully long review, and even though there is still so much more I could touch on, I think that I should end it here. If you're a fan of strategy and card gaming like I am, or if you are interested enough in this product to have taken the time to read this entire review, considering the cost, I think that this product is definitely worth giving a shot, and I'm very excited to see where Fantasy Flight Games takes this game in upcoming expansions. I'm very excited to start playing this brand-new LCG franchise at the very beginning, and I'm really looking forward to collecting each new Adventure Pack and Deluxe expansion as they're released. I hope this review was helpful, and until next time, enjoy your gaming!how many!), Enemies engage them in combat, and this can definitely make for a very challenging, but ultimately rewarding experience.

B001FAFO3W|5.0|I loved this movie when I was younger, even had the little cardboard dolls of all the characters. Happy to have found it on dvd so now I can let my daughter grow up with it. Happy with it and the price.
B0045I3EJC|5.0|This is easily the best movie I've ever seen. From the plot to the acting to the music and everything in between.    In short, Mr Nobody shows the life of a person who is conscious across multiple parallel worlds in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of quantum mechanics and can even unravel chaotic systems.    Of course you don't need to understand that to watch the film - Its an amazing piece of work. I'll confess I've thought about this film and its implications as I lead my life DAILY for the past two and a half months. Yes, its that deep.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This was a good game.  For people like myself who like puzzle solving games where you wander around gathering clues and items, this game is very good.  Some of the puzzles are clever.  However, the game is very short without any other levels to solve.  Once the game is done (in about 1-2 hours) you're done.  It would be nice to have more levels to extend the total play time to several hours.  In addition, there is no save option to be able to stop and come back later.    Overall, a good game for puzzle solvers.
B002LLE3Q8|4.0|When this album was first released, the Mellotron (a predecessor of the synthesizer) that King Crimson used was startlingly new. I remembered \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" as being an amazing single, and when I saw the CD was available I quickly bought it.  That one song holds up well, but alas, the rest of the songs on the album do not. Now that the technology is a thing of the distant past, the avant-garde noodlings aren't particularly appealing. Still, if you remember King Crimson you might find it worth while.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|I have listened to Rush since the late 1970's. I finally got to see them in concert in Oklahoma City in April 2008. They sound better than ever - and that's saying a LOT. I saw Led Zeppelin on their final tour (amazing, of course), watched Joni Mitchell do a soundcheck then her concert that evening (mid-1980's, \\"Mingus\\" tour), saw Crosby, Stills and Nash twice, Bonnie Raitt, The Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Kiss, Emmylou Harris, Fleetwood Mac (\\"Rumors\\" tour), Rod Stewart,  The Grateful Dead, Cat Stevens, and numerous other concerts over the years. This Rush concert was the BEST CONCERT I'VE EVER SEEN. Seriously. Geddy Lee is the best bassist ever, Alex Lifeson sets his guitar on fire and Neil Peart - the best drummer and lyricist/poet around. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for anyone who loves great music - this is it.

1936719010|5.0|Thank you Amazon for the FREE Kindle version of this book. As a writer with multiple unfinished projects, this book uncovered the true reasons behind the incomplete manuscripts - resistance. Now I can stop blaming myself and others, knock-out the excuses, and battle the real culprit. I have just started \\"The War of Art\\" and am finding it inspiring and motivating. Having read Robert McKee's introduction and learning that even the most successful writers continue to battle resistance has given me a new hope for all those projects hidden away on my hard drive. Thank you Steven for writing these books.

B000JU7N7E|3.0|I've read several of Gaiman's books before, and I've read one of Pratchett's.  This books is well within both of their styles, so you might like it better if you're more of a fan of their books than I am.    Characters    The beginning of the book centers on Crowley, who is a demon, and Aziraphale, an angel.  These two have been on opposing sides over the past 6,000 years that the world has existed, and over that time they've developed a friendship of sorts.  At the very least they try not to interfere with each other.  Along with these two, the book also shows several humans as they interact with each other and the events going on in the world.    Setting    The book is set in England around the time it was written.  Late 1980s or early 1990s.    Plot    This is the brilliant idea of the book.  The basic premise is that instead of being raised by satanists who will push him towards the evil he was intended to do, the antichrist (named Adam in the book) is raised by a regular family in a small suburban town.  The book takes place in the days leading up to Armageddon.  We follow Aziraphale, Crowley, Adam, and several other characters as they deal with some very strange things happening in the world.    Enjoyment    The book had a wonderful premise, but in a lot of ways just never worked for me as well as I think it could've.  There were a lot of funny parts (Crowley fighting off two other demons, killing one with holy water and trapping the other one in an answering machine tape was fun), but ultimately the way the story was told was odd.  All of the primary viewpoint characters ultimately end up being very tangental to the overall plot.  There were also a lot of times when the humor in the book seemed stretched to me.  If you've read Pratchett before, you know that he uses footnotes in his books, while these aren't necessarily bad, in this book they really varied from amazingly entertaining to me asking why I even bothered to read them.    Overall Grade    Some good, some bad, if you're a fan of Pratchett or Gaiman, go for it, otherwise I can't say I'd give this book too much of a recommendation.    6/10
B003UESJ9M|5.0|So this is officially the VERY first time I am writing a Review on Amazon. Which is pretty surprising since I'm a huge Movie and Music buff. I literally just got done watching Country Strong and I jumped on here to find out if a I could buy a Soundtrack. I was never a huge country fan but I am a fan of Hayes Carll who is an amazing musician and someone who is very over looked. I was so surprised to hear Garrett Hedlund singing some of his songs in this movie and I hope more people get turned on to Hayes cause both his CD's are two of my favorites.    Moving on..I felt the need to write a review of this movie simply because I wanted so badly to give it props. I really really Loved it and I think the entire cast did an amazing job. This was the first time I have ever scene Garrett Hedlund but I must say I am beyond smitten. Ha! It might have something to do with the fact he reminds me of a young Viggo Mortensen and Viggo is def my all time favorite actor. Another brilliant man who is at times over looked.     SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! It really has heart, not to mention great music and I got teared up in the end which doesn't happen often. I hate that there are some people who said it was slow or just not good at all. I don't get it. This is a character driven movie that represents REAL people with REAL flaws and REAL Passions.    I can't say enough about it. It was def a movie I'm going to buy RIGHT AWAY..I'm also going to buy the soundtrack...and I'm def a new fan of Garrett Hedlund. I have a feeling we will def be seeing him around much more. And of course as always Leighton Meester was amazing. She is already a star. Oh and I don't mean to focus only on the young part of the cast...Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw where GREAT. But the romantic in me of course can't help but think Garrett and Leighton stole the show.    This movie had Walk the Line, and a Thing called love written all over it. And yet it is different and unique in it's own way.
B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|This CD release surprised me - I bumped into it at Starbucks, of all places.  I'm a huge, long-time fan.  Some of the critics of this CD have their points to a slight degree - but they seem so minor in the light of Buck's guitar magic and the catchy melodies sung so well by Stipe and Mills. This CD is some of Buck's best work in my opinion and Stipe seems to step out lyrically more into the open and brings new courage into his work. And if you're not finding any of these melodies too memorable, I would encourage you to give it another listen or two. You might be surprised.
B001UV4XI8|3.0|Having stated that I'm not necessarily a fan of the series doesn't mean I don't appreciate and actually have quite enjoyed several of the earlier films. This seems to go to a rather dark place which unto itself can make for great drama but I prefer to see the characters rise above the challenges. Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery (if mostly stark) but our intrepid heroes appear less and less intrepid - perhaps the point of their dire circumstances and maybe more realistic but not more preferable personally. A two part final episode might be a throw back to the cliff-hangers of earlier cinema but it doesn't seem to have the same sense of holding-one's-breath tension. The good guys are quite beaten down, the bad guy has all the advantage and you don't get the feeling the heroes are even ready to step up and face him. Obviously this is all personal preference, I like the little guys to at least keep getting their shots in and to be able to see a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel (even if it turns out to be a train rushing at them). The Blu-ray set itself is top notch, wonderful quality print with plenty of extras, including what might be considered a lot of marketing for the last film. Why they think anyone buying this needs to be sold on the last episode.....?
0761536434|4.0|I applaud this authors creating a book based on video games history. It is for the most part a good read. The downside is as follows:  1) Pays way too much attention to Atari and Nintendo NES, although these are the two most remembered systems ever, little attention was paid to Vic-20. C64, Apple II.  2) There was too much legalese, which to its credit, illustrated how it affected the market, it was way too much for for the purpose of this book. These segments should maybe put in a separate book of case analysis of video game law.   3) More photos could have been added.    But in all, most video game enthusiast would enjoyed this book and it seemed like the author put in a lot of time and effort to make this book possible. So kudos to him and the industry people who took time to share stories.
B00417HV14|5.0|Excellent performance, music and film.  The extras are also very interesting.  This gets regular viewing in our house.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|The app it's amazing. Really good if you like to hear what's around the globe. Iam just don't like the fact that I need 25 words to post a comment
B00005RHF8|3.0|At least they found a copy somewhere to create this DVD.  They do apologise for the quality, but I really love THIS version on film from 1970, so thanks for making it available!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|This has been a great prodcut. I syncs up to the satellites very quickly. Distance for my routes have been nearly exactly what I had calculated by other methods. Has been very easy to use, although haven't used nearly all of the features yet. Only problem I had was in getting the ANT installed properly - it does matter which USP port you use. Plugged into a port on the front of the desktop and could not get it to work properly, but when plugged into the back went flawlessly. Downloads data as easily as stated.    Only caution is to beware watching the split times to closely especially if you are competitive. First week I had it, I overdid the pace a little and ended up with an injury that cost me a couple weeks training!
B000000H7T|5.0|I'd first heard of Sepultura in some rock magazine and thought they were from LA. Somehow I compared the name with Sepulveda as in the Sepulveda flood control dam, but soon learned Sepulveda and \\"Sepultra\\" (as I thought it was spelled) wasn't even close. \\"Sepultura\\" was the Brazilian Portuguese word for grave and it wasn't long before I heard their song Dead Embryonic Cells on MTV. I loved the video and the song. It was a friend that gave me this cassette, no cover, no box, but I played it quite a bit and almost wore it out. I haven't played it for decades but finally dug it out and burned it to CD. It has a few rough spots on it but the best songs still play fine. My favorites are the first three songs, Arise, Dead Embryonic Cells and Desperate Cry. While the others are also good, those first three strike the strongest memories for me.<br /><br />This album may rate as primitive by their own standards compared to their later work such as Roots, but I think as with a lot of bands, their earlier work, while being more crude, was also their most creative. I have one of their later live albums right before they broke up and they do several songs off this album. They just don't sound as good. Live and much later in their lives, these songs seemed rushed and kind of half-baked. Of course, I'm sure they were pretty sick of playing them and were also at each other's throats by that point.<br /><br />Anyway... this is classic thrash and holds up with the best of the era. Highly recommended.
B004G6009U|5.0|Finally!! Disney got it right once again.  Wonderful adaption to the Rapunzel story.  Lighthearted and fun.  Our whole family enjoyed this and I look forward to watching it again and again.  Zac Levi is perfect as the suave, debonair leading man and Mandy Moore as the naive leading lady.    Who knew frying pans could be so useful!!
B003SNJYSK|4.0|This is a good detective book and has some very nice twists in the plot. It also reflects on Norway's part in WWII in an interesting way.<br />I did however find the book a little slow to start and was somewhat disappointed compared to the very good reviews I got about this book.<br />Overall I liked the book but didn't find it exceptional as some other reviewers did.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|The movie was good, I enjoyed it.  But I'm pretty annoyed at only having the option (that I could find) to buy the Blu-Ray / DVD combo.  I really just want the basic Blu-Ray, nothing else, for a basic price.  This combo packaging sucks.
B004FOA84A|5.0|this game was so much fun!!!....it was challenging and took me a while to complete but it was a fun challenge!...i got i when it was free but i would deffinately suggest buying it for 99 cents
B000024D4R|5.0|I love this album.  In addition to the iconic photographs, the sonic display put forth by the band is fantastic.  David Gilmour demonstrates a mastery of the talkbox that so many other popular guitarists who like to use it could learn from.  He melds it perfectly into his usual style.
B00000JCEC|2.0|What happened to this guy? He went from being lovable slob who landed the most luckiest position ever to some self-crowned higher knowledge of human condition. And there is nothing wrong with that, but it does mean the music will suffer a bit.     Not too much, as some songs will be deliberately 'carefree' (or am I the only who can see the CONTRADICTION). But Ringo, you used to be so much fun, but this album is SO serious. There are a few good songs, such as the mysterious 'Runaways' and a couple of fun rockers, but overall it feels like a philosophy lecture at the State University of Bloody Boring. Rating ** 1/2 (2.50)
B000RIHBIE|1.0|I will always love Sum 41.  Everyone makes a mistake now and then.  And this album is that mistake.  Sort of a \\"What were they thinking?\\" moment.  I'm not sure I want to sell my copy because I don't want to be responsible for making someone else own it.
B00018TI6I|4.0|Jet copy the Beatles, they copy the Stones, they copy Iggy Pop, the Stooges and they even copy your pop singing lullabyes to you as a kid. So, they're trying to sound like great bands and they aren't very original? And, you might even say they are a bit of dopey fun? So they really are 21st century 'Troggs', with their girl-loving anthems and pleasant if inconsequential stabs at 'greatness' (i.e. their 'ballads')    But hey! Wasn't that the point of it all in 2003, a band that actually could play their instruments well enough to immitate the Beatles and Stones? Or was it getting old by then? I'm sure there were a couple of bands who had been selling millions of album a few years before, who, couldn't for the life of them, cover a Stones song. And Jet can, hooray!! I'm sure there are some late-90's rock bands who watch Jet's guitarist playing the guitar, going 'Oh! That's why they're called Jet, because they play their instruments SO FAST!'    'Are you gonna be my girl' was a rip-off of 'Lust for life' was it, oh ok! Well I'm younger than you lot and can remember, back in the day, there was a tune called 'you can't hurry love'. So you see, not only did Jet rip off Iggy, so did The Supremes!  Shame Shame Tut Tut!    And, give credit where credit is due, Lead singer Nic Cester (yeah there really isn't an h) sings like he's having an orgasm, giving rock music a much needed kick up the backside to get it going again. And another thing, While some of the ballads are 4 1/2 minutes, the opening rocker, Last Chance, just misses the two-minute mark, but it deserves the 4 minute mark, possibly the biggest adrenaline rush here.     Not taken too seriously, it's a pretty good listen. Rating ***1/2 (3.50)
1453767533|2.0|I had to read this for a class, and I ended up skimming through the book because I thought it was boring.
B001KL3GY0|3.0|Franz Ferdinand offer their glitzy art-pop with some good melodies here, some catchy choruses there, and a sea of textures.     And while they bask in their importance, giving a run-down of the sins of the modern, ever present 'one night stand', as if they are knighted great social commentators, well, I find myself actually impressed and vaguely moved. I was even more impressed by how many elements they were able to fit into a song, what mixing disco, garage rock and new wave? You try making that all sit well together! Bet you can't!     And don't accuse them of being overwrought, either, they sing with enough passion to make it listenable, but not enough to bring the record home. So, although the glitzy shine to the record effectively works like a stab at the hollow nature of modern pop, in all it's sinful, shallow excess, the listener rarely connects with it either. But who cares, it's not as if we really want to have deep empathy for wasted rock stars with a 'groupie' hangover. Wait! That's what we want most of all!!!! Rating 2 1/2 (2.50)
0307408833|5.0|My 5 year old was recently diagnosed with many food allergies and sensitivities stemming from eosinophilic esophagitus. We do not know yet if he can tolerate spelt, and he cannot have soy. We have no problem working around these ingredients. The fact that I can make gluten free, dairy free, egg free treats that are absolutly yummy is all I care about. So far we have made the chocolate chip cookies and the vanilla cupcakes (with alternative frosting). Both my children love these treats.     The title of the book describes the content perfectly there are no suprises. However, you do have to read the baking tips in the beginning of the book, especially if you have never worked with ingredients such as coconut oil and gluten free flours. Yes some of the ingredients are pricey but if you look into the health benefits of coconut oil and other ingredients it makes it a little easier to fork over the cash at Whole Foods.    I highly recommend this book. A must if you or your child has dietery challenges that eliminate gluten, dairy, and or eggs.    I should also mention I am not a cooking professional. Before my child was diagnosed, my idea of cooking was take out. So if I can do it, anyone can.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Oh no! Look out boys! Here comes another derivative entry into the already crowded classic-rock revival to come along since 2000, making starry-eyed, loving-smile recreations of their heroes best songs. After 'Look what you've done' has finished you can almost hear the boys tenderly say 'This is dedicated to a Beatles song we love very very much'.     But at least these guys sing with earnest. The old wise saying 'The importance of being \\"Ernest\\"'. Come on man! Nic Cester sings like he having an orgasm, giving rock music the good kick up the backside it really needed in 2003. And maybe that's why they were called Jet, the proficiency with their instruments, at least, to be able to play classic rock (there are some bands who just don't have the ability to play it).    'Are you gonna be my girl' was a rip-off of 'Lust for life' was it, oh ok! Well I'm younger than you lot and can remember, back in the day, there was a tune called 'you can't hurry love'. So you see, not only did Jet rip off Iggy, so did The Supremes!  Shame Shame Tut Tut!    A bit of dopey, unoriginal fun, they are more like 'The Troggs' for the 2000's, rather than Beatles or Stones. Which means, not so bad. For great tracks, look out for 'Are you gonna be my girl' (of course), 'Lazy Gun' (begins with some interesting guitar effects and evolves into an interesting mid-tempo rocker) and the opening 'Last Chance', an energy blast which deserves to be a whole lot longer. Rating ***1/2 (3.50)
B004G600A4|5.0|I am a huge fan of Disney animation and have lost faith in it the last few years, so I wasn't expecting much. However, Tangled blew me away and returned to the Disney art of storytelling I love. I wanted to watch it again as soon as it ended! The animation itself is phenomenal, the characters are well-developed, the casting was perfect (Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi shined in their roles), and laugh-out loud humor kept the story light and sweet. I also love how the artists used Fantasyland in Disneyland as inspiration for the setting--it was just one more nuance that drew you back to Disney movies in their prime. You will absolutely love this movie!
1439102724|1.0|First I have to say, that I read every book by Jodi Picoult and even though I sometimes do not agree with some of her characters, she usually always does a great job with her characters and making you understand their point of view. That said, I am so disappointed in her last book, that I couldn't even finish it. The characters are stereotyped and there is no way for me to identify with (or even understand) any of the three characters in the book. It's slow reading and does not even seem to make sense.Why would Zoe fight her ex-husband for the embryos so much? Why would she not find another avenue with less resistence? Maybe I am being unfair, since I did not finish it, but I really couldn't take it any longer. I mean, opposing gangs coming together and playing the drums and becoming friends? Really?
B004FOA84A|5.0|High-quality mystery-puzzle game similar to Myst. Takes a couple hours to complete unless you are a super genius. Graphics and puzzles are all first-rate.    I've seen people complaining about the game being too short. For 99 cents? With this kind of game the developers can't automatically generate infinite puzzles. The game ending suggests sequels - can't wait.    Played on my Droid X with no technical problems.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|this harry potter movie certainly out did its self the quality was amazing and was kept in suspense the whole entire time. i was glad to rent it at such a low price and i cant wait for part 2 i have been anxious ever since the begining about harry potter and the dark lord's battle and i am working on not looking at the spoilers.

0756404738|3.0|First, let me start by saying that I absolutely love \\"The Name of the Wind.\\"  It's a great book. I've read it several times. When I recommend it to people, they always love it.    \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" is only so-so in my book.  Kvothe's story takes up again with some more hijinks at the University.  First, these scenes take entirely too long.  They're pretty much college pranks with a \\"look how awesome my friends and I are\\" vibe. But they take FOREVER.  Then, Kvothe skips over what is probably the much more interesting tale of his trial in Imre.  Anyway, the trial and pranks serve to convince Kvothe to take a semester or two off and travel abroad.  While he is traveling to his destination, some crazy stuff happens to him.  Supposedly he is shipwrecked and robbed and gets in all sorts of scraps, but we never find out about any of that because Kvothe skips over that part.  Then we wait as things slow down again for some wooing of women.  Denna, of course, but Kvothe helps an important benefactor woo a woman, too. Yay! Women are wooed! (More or less.)     Now it's time for some manly stuff! Kvothe versus the brigands! (Guess who wins. Handily, even.)      Then we come to one truly interesting part of the book, Kvothe's time (and training) with Felurian.  Interesting revelations and main-plot-furthering events take place! Finally.  (Hurrah!)    But it is not to last. It is determined that Kvothe is not badass enough.  So off he goes to the Adem to learn to fight. Cue stock martial arts training montage! (As a martial artist myself, I think some real life martial experience could have helped Rothfuss here.) As a consolation prize to the reader, one tiny bit of main plot information is revealed.  Tiny.  Miniscule.  But, hey, who's gonna complain about gratuitous fighting and sex? Me. Obviously.)    So then, with his badassery no longer in doubt, Kvothe returns to civilization and the University, making some new friends and enemies along the way, stopping to be a hero at anygiven opportunity. People are appropriately in awe of him.  And.... scene. That's it. Finito. Done with Book 2.    Do we know anything more about the Chandrian? Not really. The Amyr? Kvothe does, but we really got all that info in Book 1.      Now if this were any normal fantasy series, I'd say, \\"Enh, not as strong as the first book. We'll see if he can pick it up a bit with the next one.\\"  But see, in the FOUR YEARS since the first book, I've had time to read Steven Erikson's entire \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen Series.\\" Ten books.  Each one about as long or longer than either of Rothfuss's books.  Then I find out that Erikson is cranking out these ginormous, completely awesome, and truly original books at a nice rate of about one per year.  But Rothfuss takes four years to churn out a so-so follow up to one of the best debut novels in the history of fantasy literature.  But wait, in the beginning, didn't Rothfuss say all three books were already written? That's right. He did. That means Rothfuss took four years to REVISE a so-so book, supposedly so he could make sure it is absolutely PERFECT. Yeah. But hey, he raised a crap-ton of money for Heifer International and some lucky duck had his name worked into the book in some way that we'll likely never know about.  That makes it all worth it, right? I guess. Maybe. Sorta. (Not at all, actually.)    So let me save you all a bit of trouble. Don't buy this book right now.  Wait about five years when Book 3 will come out.  Pick up a paperback copy of \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" at a used bookstore somewhere. Skim it until you get to the Felurian chapters. Read those carefully.  Skim the rest of the book.  Then you'll have saved yourself some money and time, and you won't have spent five years dying to figure out how the awesome story that Rothfuss created in \\"The Name of the Wind\\" ends.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|From Richard I, to John Lackland, to Eleanor, Phillip, and Isabella, this movie has a lot of historical pieces going for it.  It gets close to the theme of the Magna Carta, constraining the rule of kings, which was an important historical event.  The cinematography and settings are extremely well done, and like all Ridley Scott work this one brings you back to the story again and again to get more out of it.  Some movies bear a single viewing, if that, but this one looks better, and more interesting, over time.  Certainly the story of Robin Hood is a fantasy tale, but the historical backdrop here, and the placement of key characters such as Will Scarlet, couldn't be better.  Marion as a warrior \\"queen\\" of her people too far out for you?  Not in a land that gave us Boadicea (Boudica).  You have to love Cate Blanchett in this role.

0385738757|5.0|I thought that The Maze Runner was amazing and couldn't imagine how the series could get any better but of course I was proven wrong by the evil genius that is James Dashner. I had no idea my emotions could go through this kind of turmoil that The Scorch Trials put me through, it was intense, thrilling and creeptastic beyond belief.<br /><br />The Scorch Trials starts off immediately after The Maze Runner ended, the kids realize just as the reader does that the whole rescue thing was a fake and just another part of the tests by WICKED. In this one they have to make their way through an abandoned city in the middle of nowhere that they call The Scorch, where they are given pretty much nothing to survive or protect themselves with against the people that are infected with the Flare. The beginning to me was a little slow but definitely had the intrigue factor that sucked me right in and kept me flipping the pages, it also kept giving off creepy vibes that just escalated until the point that I got actual chills and goosebumps, and at one point I was so freaked out that I thought I would have nightmares. Of course the pace quickly picks up and the story is once again very unpredictable that I found myself at the edge of my seat glued to the pages while chewing my nails, afraid of the type of horrors these kids were going to have to go through next.<br /><br />I loved that in this one we get to know just a little more about WICKED and find out clues about this whole trial throughout the entire book from memories and dreams that Thomas has. We still feel just as confused as the characters in this one, there's betrayal and mind games, lies and danger all around that just like the characters you feel that you don't know what to believe or who to trust. I pretty much immersed myself into these characters and this story that I was feeling the rollercoaster of emotions and frustration, the sadness and the anger, it was very intense but I loved it! I was glad to see that we get a little backstory about what happened to the world and about The Flare, we get introduced to a few new characters and also get a close up and vivid description of what the disease does to people, Yikes!<br /><br />The ending once again left me gaping and with a mind full of questions that I'm hoping will get answered in the next one. I'm just as confused as I was at the beginning of the book, because even though we got a little more clues there still just wasn't enough to solve this puzzle that James Dashner has sucked me into. I'm keeping hope alive that nothing bad will happen to my favorite characters in The Death Cure and wondering what else will the evil James Dashner throw at us, cannot wait!tory about what happened to the world and about The Flare, we get introduced to a few new characters and also get a close up and vivid description of what the disease does to people, Yikes!

0307477479|5.0|I am not a fan of experimental fiction.  I don't like it when writers deliberately try to be \\"literary,\\" and in so doing completely obscure their meanings and any hint of a story in their attempt to \\"do something new.\\"  I feel that too often writers use literary gimmicks to hide the fact that their actual story is thin, with poorly realized characters that even the writer can't possibly love.<br />After reading a few reviews of A Visit from the Goon Squad, I was afraid it would be like that.  I dislike hype.  But this book is absolutely wonderful.  It is both literary AND readable.  It has interesting characters I actually cared about AND it was smart.  I read it in only a few days, and a week later, I am still thinking about it.<br />It's difficult to describe what this book is \\"about.\\"  When people ask that question I feel like they are looking for an easy answer, like \\"it's about a kleptomaniac with a heart who is kind of looking for love\\" or \\"it's about a middle aged man who looks back on his life with regret and wonderment\\" or \\"it's about a group of crazy characters trying to make it in the music world and how they succeed or fail.\\"  Well, even though this book has all those elements, it's really not \\"about\\" any of those things.  It's about the nature of growing up and growing old, regret, making it big, failing miserably, and making comebacks.  It's about the way that the world changes when you aren't looking, or how the culture renews and reinvents itself again and again. It's about growth, or life, or time, or any of those \\"big\\" ideas.<br />But if you just want it to be about kleptomaniacs, creepy middle aged men, music executives, and strange kids who grow up to be even stranger adults, then it can be that too.<br />I note that other lower star reviewers have talked about the fact that the voice jumps back and forth in time and place with no warning to the reader and you never find out what happens to everyone.  This is not true.  The story never just leaps mid-paragraph into another decade or confuses the heck out of you for no reason.  Those \\"jumps in time\\" only take place from chapter to chapter.  For people who find this disconcerting or confusing, just read it as a book of short stories with recurring characters.  It will become more than that, but it will make the read much easier for you if you go in with the expectation that you are not reading a linear novel.  Yes, a few characters never reappear, and you might wonder what happens to them, but you do find out what happens to most of the characters by the end of the book, which is immensely satisfying, with beautiful touches that remind you of just how intricate and interesting this novel really is.ph into another decade or confuses the heck out of you for no reason.

B0026P3G12|1.0|One of the worst buys I've ever made.  She couldn't even sing the complete songs.<br />This was one of the worst renditions of Amazing Grace that I have ever heard.  It is such a shame that the producers of this album felt the need to conceal such an amazing voice with all the horrid background music.  Don't waste your money on this drivel.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I was really hopeful this product would work so I ignored the bad reviews and bought it.  I was a fool.  Everyone is absolutely right the battery only lasts 5 minutes despite following the charging instructions to the T.  I am returning this product and will spend my money on a better brand.  I am very disappointed!
B000ANVPPQ|2.0|McLintock!, 1963 film    The story begins on a cattle ranch in the west. Hereford cattle will be herded and shipped to Kansas City (then shipped to Chicago for processing). George Washington McClintock is the big landowner in this area. He doesn't want homesteaders settling in the Mesa Verde (\\"green table\\"). He owns the water rights (and has other powers). McClintock advises the homesteaders that land above 6,000 feet in altitude is not good for farming because of varying rainfall. (Was that true?) Later he goes into town and reads a letter. This hotel has women in the lobby, as if they are waiting for customers. He visits his wife Kate in a hotel room (she wants a divorce). \\"I hate you.\\" Outside a man asks for a job, then takes a punch at McClintock. Friendly Indians visit the encampment. McClintock hires a new cook. [Would a cattle baron own a big brick mansion in a remote region?] Kate returns to the house. There is interaction and conversation among the people there.    McClintock goes in to town, visits the saloon, then plays chess. Kate visits him for a talk. \\"Ha, ha ha.\\" Two men complain about the presence of Indians. There is trouble in town. McClintock gets involved. \\"The hell I won't.\\" The men provide entertainment for the watching people. Some slide in the mud. This strange ritual amuses the Indians and the viewers. How to wash off that mud? The next day daughter Rebecca arrives on the train. Also on the train are the released Indians. The chief has been educated in jail (like other surviving freedom fighters). Rebecca brought a friend and his parents too. There is drama in Rebecca's talk with Devlin Warren. There is a barbecue in celebration, and dancing. Matt Douglas Jr. shows a new dance from New York. Devlin shows the skill he learned at college. So does his uncle.    Rebecca seeks advice from her Dad about the status of her parents' marriage; he gives some. McClintock plans to leave most of his land for a national park. He wants his daughter to experience early pioneer days. [Believable in 1895, the worst depression of the 19th century?] There is a song for entertainment. Does everybody work for everybody else? The drive results in trouble. A good spanking? More trouble? There is a court case the next day. Territorial Governor Cuthbert Humphrey presides. McClintock speaks for the Comanches against their removal to Fort Sill. [Were the Comanches a danger in 1895?] The times are changing. Does McClintock have a plan?    McClintock arrives home with a load on. What was he doing? He complains about the Governor, as if all a politician thinks of is money. [Don't forget the votes!] \\"What's going on here?\\" Is there a problem with those stairs? The people are free to celebrate July Fourth with a rodeo. Children set off fireworks. [A lost freedom?] There is a horse race. The Governor gets splattered. The door to a boxcar opens, a long wooden box falls out. There is an explosion, the Comanches ride again. A bugle announces the arrival of the Cavalry. Plenty of excitement. \\"Where did they get the guns?\\" But the celebration goes on. Kate is chased by McClintock for comic effect. [Are these scenes still funny today?]    This movie seems to contain scenes from many previous John Wayne films, such as \\"The Quiet Man\\". It probably was not very successful then. It is too comic for a drama, and the story isn't that great. Wayne starred in better movies, based on better stories.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|the whole idea of the cloud is great and it works very well on my incredible. I bought one cd and they gave me 20gb of storage. I use it to store a lot of music that I can access from any computer or smartphone. love it.
B00138F54O|4.0|Gotta appreciate Danzig doing what they (he) does.  Nicely done record, with the original version of \\"Mother\\" on it.  This came out in the late 80's, and was clearly pushing ahead, past the hair metal bands and the speed metal stuff.  Great for any Danzig fan, and a good introduction for any aspiring Danzing fan.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We watched this on PBS, but it was wonderful to see it without commercials. It was almost as good as seeing in person.
B004PA50JM|5.0|Good to know that R.E.M. is still putting out great albums.  Their last two (this one and Accelerate) show R.E.M. in top form.  Best R.E.M. records in a while.  Start to finish, this is a strong record.
0061714372|4.0|I liked this book a lot. However, my interest waned towards the very end especially the religious stuff. I still get the impression that nothing has really changed for Dave, and he will always be bitter about his time in Metallica. Interestingly enough and you will find this ironic after reading the book that it's been reported although still rumor that he is back on drugs or still using in some capacity at least from online sources. And it's been noted that he has not changed at all. This sort of makes the last portion of the book meaningless! Either way it was a good read!
020161622X|5.0|I just recently recommended this book to a friend who's starting to learn programming. This is the one I wished I'd read first, before learning any specific language or taken any class on programming. Although not very long, this book hits lots of important topics and more importantly, approaches them in the right way.    More than anything else, the reason I love this book so much is that it talks about how to approach programming in the right spirit. What do I mean by this? I mean that this book tells you how to think about that act of programming itself, from a meta-view, as an art, a craft, something in which to take great joy. I know too many professionals in the field who just view programming as a 9-to-5 job, getting comfortable and safe in their tenure, letting their skills become outdated as they write reams and reams of mediocre code. This book is the antithesis of that mindset.    Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt are geniuses, plain and simple. They explain how they love writing code and inspire in others (at least in me) to love it in the same way. Their tone is such that it feels like your buddy from class is chatting with you over lunch rather than like you're being lectured on irrelevant technical details. As a side note, all of the many books I've read from the Pragmatic Programmers have been awesome. I recommend them all, but this is the one I recommend most. Buy this book; you won't be disappointed.
B00006GO9Q|4.0|Well, this is the work of the definitive \\"artistic maturity\\" for a great artist such as Miles Davis, whose \\"impact\\"- in the history of the best cool jazz music genre- is important so far!!  For instance, here you find the first defined \\"fusion\\" experiments during his remarkable career in the sixties and- moreover-the improvisational moments upon the melodic structure and the repetitive sketches, which allow a kind of \\"reduction\\" concerning the music plot, represent some important features...even though- actually- the whole length should be over two hours, but the producer Teo Macero decided to cut down the duration to 80 minutes and then along with Miles even to 27 minutes: in fact at the end of the album divided into two sections, the main music phrases have been repeated twice, probably in order to let him play in a more concise manner... in particular here you find the most remarkable phrasing and also his trumpet is extraordinary.    \\"Shhh/Peaceful\\" is a great jam, enriched by means of a fine harmony, being supported by three keyboardists and the jam led by the guitarist and the sax player as well.    As a matter of fact, the connections between several different elements , create a big contrast in the composition and also regarding of track#2- \\"In A Silent Way/It's About That Time\\"- which is different from the tune as it was originally written by J. Zawinul, characterized (as it was when He wrote the composition) by too many chords!    At the end, the final section of It's About That Time\\" is a bluesy clever piece of work, with its amazing groove, which is splitted by everything that could be composed by Weather Report for instance...the repetitions inside allow such a reflective and intense moment of art, rather than being a more serious impediment to the music growth!     Perhaps the present album could be essential also for a \\"purist\\" fan of fusion prog music, even though- basically this is a must-have for the lovers of the intelligent cool jazz!!
0735619670|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what other reviewers have already said no doubt better and more succinctly than I could, so I'll just summarize:    This one is the real deal. This book will make you a better programmer, immediately. If there is one book I would recommend to everyone who writes code, regardless of all other factors, this book would be it. A classic and truly a joy to read. Buy this book; you will not be disappointed.
B0000CABBW|4.0|I really liked this movie. I thought it was a cute movie, and a family movie. I think this movie is a great movie to teach young girls about traditional gender roles, \\"girl power\\", and also for parents to learn about accepting and embracing our children for who they really are or aspire to be.     This movie is about a young girl named Pai (Paikea). Her twin brother who died at birth (along with their mom) was supposed to be the next leader of the tribe. Her dad left her and went to Europe to pursue his art career with his pregnant girlfriend.It was tradition that the first born males of the family became the next chief. However, her brother died, so they began training a group of boys to find out who would be the next one. Pai secretly trains with them, hiding the whole time because she is a girl.     At the end, her grandpa knows she is supposed to be the next chief. A bunch of whales get stuck on the beach and no one knows what to do with them. Pai is able to ride one of the beached whales back to sea, and the rest follow. Everyone knows she is supposed to be the leader of the tribe, and she deserves it.    This movie has a lot of examples of indigenous religions. For example, they are very connected with nature and respect it. Also they have chiefs which are common in indigenous religions. It also seems to be a very male-dominated world that she lives in, which is common in indigenous religions. Also, they chant, sing, have oral history through the telling of stories, and calling on spirits.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|This movie is a combination of a lot of different things, but for the most part you will enjoy it more if you accept that you're watching an action movie, as this movie isn't aiming to be high brow so much as entertaining. At the same time, it doesn't aim to be completely mindless either. Sweet Pea's breaking the fourth dimension (barrier?) near the beginning of the movie is clever, as well as various one liners provided by Scott Glen's character (many of which you've heard before, but all worth hearing again). The story itself is somewhat dark, but not pessimistic. I waited until it arrived at the discount theater because I was worried it would be more dark and pessimistic than it turned out to be. It's more akin to 'Life is Beautiful' in my opinion than to 'Sin City'.     Snyder's imagination in my opinion is right up there with Guillermo del Toro although Snyder's imagery is more tied to pop culture, whether it's samurai and chinese temples, mechs ala robotech, steam-punkish nazis, orcs and dragons, or futuristic robot soldiers. Throw into that mix some sharp costumes, the spinning camera from 'The Matrix', and you have a movie that if nothing else is good to look at and entertaining to watch. It's worth at least a rental, and if you're a fan of Snyder's other movies, it's worth a purchase when they decide to release this on dvd and bluray.
1936719010|5.0|This was a quick read and held my attention, front to back. I especially like his advice on starting before you're ready, we can always find a \\"need\\" for a bit more research, a bit more prep work, a bit more . . . a never-ending string of \\"why we should wait till tomotrrows\\". Great examples and analogies.
B000001FYL|1.0|When the CD came it was in the Blaze of Glory case but the CD itself was some rap group. Seller said she would refund but did not.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a fun adventure game, but it is easily beaten in about 2 hours. I was encountering a forced close message when starting it, but found that killing background apps with advanced task manager fixed the issue. This leads me to believe it has memory management issues.
0810970686|5.0|It was nephew's birthday and at the last minute he requested this book.  I could not find it in the store so I ordered from this seller.  Not only I got the book on time, the book was listed as \\"used\\".  When it came in I was surprised with its quality, it was in great shape, crisp pages, no marks simply \\"like new\\".      This book (I would say the whole series) has great lessons for kids struggling with the daily school & family life. It teaches them about friendship, faith in themselves, the importance of education and family values. Plus, encourages kids to read as it makes it fund and exciting. My nephew's reading skills had improve significantly. He enjoyed the book so much he read it in 2 weeks. GREAT BOOK!!!
B00005NKK8|4.0|There are only really two differences between this version released in 2001 and the original 1994 release. First, it adds two additional tracks: \\"Runnin' On Empty\\" by Jackson Browne and \\"Go Your Own Way\\" by Fleetwood Mac (both from 1977) on the second disc. And this time it is packaged in a slim double case. Otherwise, it is really the same album. \\"Break On Through\\" is in its censored version, \\"Mrs. Robinson\\" runs ten seconds shorter, \\"Turn! Turn! Turn!\\" is in its stereo version while \\"Joy To The World\\" is in its mono version.    By hearing this album, you are living life vicariously through the title character. If you loved the film, this album is definitely essential. If you have the original version, this is optional but still great to have.    Total Time-  Disc One 44:21  Disc Two 71:05
B004FOA84A|1.0|Force closes every time I try to open it.  Good thing I got it for free when amazon was giving it away.  Using Droid X
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app showed that several of my neighbors' wifi networks were using the same busy channel that I was using. Made a simple change in my router, and my wifi speed and stability has been better than ever! Highly recommend to anyone using wifi.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This if a great game if you got it for free. Only opens maybe one out of 20 times or so. Pretty short but good graphics. Like I said, and others, forces closes before it even opens more often than not. Droid X 2.3.3
B004FOA84A|4.0|Puzzle game were you search your granpa's house picking up and using items to solve the mystery. Very well done puzzles that bring satisfaction from solving. Good graphics too.  Quite short though at probably about 1 to 2 hours to complete your first time.  Probably worth the 99&cent;.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is a must have DVD.  You like show girl/musical this it the one. You know Cher  retired at Ceasar's Palace.  what an awesome show that was.  She was talking about and went to see it in the movies, know i have it.  I can watch it any time i want.    Got to get it.
0740748475|5.0|It's a complete collection of all of the Calvin & Hobbes comic strips ever printed, in chronological order. If you're a fan, this is definitely worth it. But it's not something you'll be carrying around with you to read at any time. It's really heavy, even just one of the three books out of the case is almost difficult to carry. But it's beautiful.
B004R36QUE|5.0|This is the story of King George VI and his attempts to overcome his inability to speak with others in private and in public.  Also having to overcome stammering like King George, I was able to identify with his struggles to come to terms with the influence of a formidable father, but the scale of the problems that King George had to overcome was truly amazing.  I found myself completely admiring the personal courage of an individual who previously had been nothing more than a historical cutout character. This movie brings him to life and gives him a human quality that was, at the risk of cliche, heart warming.<br /><br />This is also the story of King George VI's friendship with his speech therapist, Lionel Logue.  The role was played to perfection by Geoffrey Rush, who manages a perfect blend of irreverent Australian and loyal friend.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
0743289412|3.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan and I have to be honest, this wasn't as good as I though it would be.  A bit on the boring, long drawn-out side.  Unfortunate that I couldn't wait and bought it in hard cover... :(
030726999X|4.0|This book completes the trilogy and is a direct sequel of the second book, it is about the cover up of a political corruption involving a nest of Swedish intelligent officers encroached inside the Swedish Secret Intelligence System and the fight of the free press along with the country official institutions to destroy and punish them, It features the same pattern of dramatic intensity and equal depth of intrigue of book two and also the same shortcomings like very difficult to believe movie action scenes and references to the same issues over and over again. But overall is worthy to read and very gripping with good character development. To get a better perspective and understanding first read the other two books.
B002HPKYH0|2.0|I'm sorry but this book and the \\"Results\\" from taking the evaluation are much like reading your Horoscope.  It's amazing that someone, Tom Rath, can make so much money from coming up with some supposed great Psychological study that spits out such open-ended generalities. It's absurd.  Like a Horoscope, there are pieces and parts of all the \\"Strengths\\" that we can pickout about ourselves. I'm certain many of the pieces we would pickout depend greatly upon our current life situation or recent life events, whether personal or professional, and these views flow and shift with our lives and experiences.<br /><br />To me, the book is gobbledygook, full of generalizations that are all so vague that they could be apply to virtually anyone.  Anyone taking an honest look at themselves does not need this book or it's evaluation to determine what your strengths are.  Honestly, you'll probably come up with a much more accurate and insightful self-evaluation than that of this book.<br /><br />Save your money. The person who really benefits from this book is Tom Rath everytime the cash register records a sale. $$$
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed the game- took me about 2 hours to complete.  a few tricky puzzles sent me online for some help.  It is a large file game with no option to move to SD card.  There is no replay value here either.  Looking forward to more like this from the developers but minus 2 stars for lack of replay value and large file size w/ no option to move to SD card.
B00000DG1R|4.0|I brought this CD for a friend for a present. She is a huge Duran fan. She was so excited and absolutely loves this CD. Very hard to find in stores...
B002PLALCO|5.0|Like a previous reviewer, I'm a man in my late 40's; an old rocker. Not exactly Pink's demographic (if there is such a thing). I've attended and watched many, many concerts over the years, so I know what I'm talking about. The Pink show is easily the best concert I have ever seen! She set the standard by which all concerts in the future will be measured. Everyone knows that a concert these days must be a multimedia extravaganza with a big \\"wow\\" factor. Pink has done that and so much more. She has raised the bar of what is to be expected from a concert.<br /><br />I had been vaguely aware of Pink over the years, but never purchased one of her CDs or DVDs. I just knew her as the chic who sang \\"Get The Party Started.\\" I'd seen and heard a few of her videos in passing. Clearly she was a cut above the average pop princess, but I never gave her much thought. Then came the 2009 Grammy Awards where she stole the show with her (literally) death-defying performance of \\"Glitter In The Air.\\" And it wasn't all style and no substance; the song is really good! I was blown away and had a new-found respect for Pink! This eventually led me to rent the Funhouse concert from NetFlix. All I can say is WOW! I immediately purchased my own copy from Amazon. Pink's large band is filled with exceptional musicians. The one who gets the chance to shine the brightest is guitarist Justin Derrico.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this video. Someone (maybe Pink herself) will eventually figure out a way to outdo this show. But until that happens, this is the DVD you show someone from another planet who wants to know what a Rock concert is.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|This is my first Band of Horses album and I was impressed by the versatility and depth of the music. If you are looking for up tempo, thumping music then this will not be for you, but if you want to listen to more relaxing, soothing, easy to listen to music then buy this album. Each time I play this album I like it better with more appreciation of the complexity and nuances of the music. Highly recommended!
1439102724|5.0|I was totally surprised by the direction this story went!  It was quite believable, however.  I really liked the ending.
0307346617|5.0|This book is FANTASTIC, I loved it, def one of my new faves! It has people fighting to survive in all kinds of climates, areas and levels of population, from the suburbs to the cities to the country- even on water. The only down side some may find is how it jumps around, group to group-it is more like a bunch of smaller stories linked together, there is no one main character/s that are followed throughout, but one of the most imaginative zombie books I've yet to read! Can't be missed!
B000MCIBE8|5.0|The doors made a truly great disc here. There's not a bad song on here.<br />Forget the hype about the disc that existed at the time. Unfortunately the drug culture was brand new and tooted this as a example of breaking on through to some type of awakening. The fact is that this is a great group of songs from a group with massive talent.  The darkness of the last 44  years is not the fault of the doors, millions of dead from the drug culture have nothing to do with the music here it's just music and it's inventive but some of it's not for smaller kids, for instance 'the end' but the rest of the disc is fine.  At the time the band just wanted to make a good disc and then it all went into \\"image' a image that morrison couldn't escape until his death sadly.  (unless he faked his death)  , beyond that this is just some really well structured songs that moved rock toward progressive rock and that's a good thing. Prog rock was some great stuff. Critics though were trying to forget that rock is alot of fun from the simple early stuff to the most complex stuff and this was a cornerstone in rocks patheon of great discs. Sadly though people at the time were dismissing the great frat stuff and wonderful songs of just a few years earlier. NO, this stands up today as a excellent achievement musically and most reviews that are negative are about the remixes not the actual music.
0062007297|5.0|I couldn't believe the quality of the paper of this book. For a soft cover book it is just top of the line!<br />The pictures and the context are so good and real. I understood why the group has been together for all these years. Their respect and loyalty for each other is something we don't see now days.<br />I strongly recommend the Bon Jovi's book and really hope that people can see why they are so special and unique.
B0010SKUYM|3.0|i read this book when i saw that it was listed by The Onion as the science fiction/fantasy book of the year.  considering this was Rothfuss's debut novel, i thought that was pretty high praise.     and, overall, i liked the book.  i think Rothfuss has created a rather interesting and original world.  the whole concept of the University and the different skills that people learned there was a pretty cool concept--particularly because the skills weren't your run of the mill fantasy novel stuff; I thought this was a nice mix of science/engineering and \\"magic.\\"      of course, there are some flaws in the book worth noting.  first, i don't find Rothfuss the greatest of writers.  he has an interesting story to tell but doesn't always have the skill to tell it.  second, he is a bit clumsy at times with basic plot devises like foreshadowing. sometimes it was painfully obvious he was setting something up for the future; these types of devises should be more seamless.   third, as others have pointed out--the main character is a bit too good sometimes.  yes, he is flawed in that his immaturity and impetuous nature get him in trouble.  but, at the same time, he also has a knowledge of how to do things he shouldn't know how to do that is a bit hard to believe.  yes, you want to show that he is unusually talented but it has to be believable as well (or you have to make it believable for the reader).  i just don't think the author found the right balance for creating a compelling and believable character.  fourth, Rothfuss often treats his readers like they are idiots.  the author will often allude to something that a conscientious reader should pickup on pretty easily but then Rothfuss will spend a paragraph spelling out exactly what he means.  it happens often and gets a bit annoying.    there are a few other things i don't like but will leave them out for fear of spoiling parts of the plot.  overall, i liked the book and look forward to reading the next installment.  i feel that some of the weaknesses pointed out above are probably a function of Rothfuss being new to the game; this is, after all, his first novel.  I expect, and hope, that he will improve in his writing/story telling with successive books.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Works really well on my droid x 2.2, had no tech issues with it at all. The game was fun and very creative with good graphics. Sadly I finished the game too soon and was left wishing there were lots more levels. Overall I really enjoyed it. Thanks!
0756404738|3.0|i liked NOTW and the world that Rothfuss created.  I didn't think it was perfect (three stars) because Rothfuss has weaknesses as a writer that hurt the overall story and because Kvothe's character development was flawed in a number of ways.  But, overall, it was a compelling story and i wanted to read more.  thus, I was cautiously optimistic to get my hands on Wise Man's Fear--I wanted to learn more about this world but hoped that Rothfuss had grown as a writer.      Unfortunately, The Wise Man's Fear suffers from some of the same flaws as the first book (weak writing and Kvothe's character development), plus some new flaws--1) some recurring story lines are getting pretty tiresome and 2) the story didn't really advance.      **SPOILERS***    story lines growing tiresome:  1)  Denna--I don't much like her anymore; i'm tired of this cat/mouse game the two of them play.  give him a new love interest.  you have succeeded in making Denna unlikable; nothing more, nothing less.  it got to the point where, when her name would come up, i just wanted to skip ahead.  2) losing the lute--we get it...he loves the lute more than anything; clearly he will be distressed at the thought of anything happening to it.  but it seems this lute has been lost or destroyed more times than i can count.  it has ceased to be a compelling story line.  3) being broke--again, we get it--he is poor.  he can't make his tuition, or buy a shirt, or afford a cup of ale.  maybe Rothfuss realized we were getting annoyed, and that is why he resolved this one at the end of the book.  4) being good at everything he does, the first time he does it; yes, he is typically good enough to be way better than average but also knowing only enough to really be dangerous.  but this plot devise has been used over and over again in the first two books, to the point that it is a huge cliche.  it was particularly ridiculous and unbelievable used as a plot device when Kvothe has sex with Felurian.  Never had sex before?Nope.  About to have sex with a sex goddess?  Yep.  Know what?  Even though you have never done this before, you're the best...EVER.  Makes sense, right?  Thought so.     story doesn't really advance:  Kvothe is on a mission to learn about the people that killed his parents and troupe.  he doesn't know anything about the people that killed them and neither does anyone else.  we learned that in the first book.  we learned it again in the second book.  over and over again.  if we are closer to Kvothe solving this mystery...I must have missed it.  we had some great adventures but didn't really move the overall plot forward.  that is disappointing.    Rothfuss has created a unique and compelling world but his execution of day-to-day story telling leaves much to be desired.  He is very clumsy with plot devises, reuses similar themes to the point of annoyance, and over explains the obvious (treats the reader like an idiot and beats many a dead horse).  I read both books cover-to-cover; I did enjoy them.  But they are not 4-5 star efforts, by any means.  Will i read the next installment?   Surely but I do hope that Rothfuss is able to evolve as a writer as he advances his career.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|Works great on my Motorola Xoom. Excellent user interface and easy to use menu. Can't beat Amazon's free price but I would recommend paying for it if you need a PDF reader. Especially on a honeycomb tablet.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This was an awesome movie! There is just the right balance between the impossible and the real life action to keep you laughing. Although parts of the story line are very predictable, it does not ruin the overall enthusiasm of the movie. IT IS AWESOME!!!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Could use a honeycomb style widget but otherwise great app. Sound quality is excellent and you can't beat free.  Ability to play and pause from taskbar would also be helpful.
0545128285|3.0|as many people have said, this book is very short...i think j.k. rowling wrote this quickly and only meant for it to be for her 6 friends as a thank you gift...so it really never was meant for everyone to read. It can be entertaining, especially after you have read the whole series and dont know what to read anymore but it isnt her best work. Obviously, we all can agree her best work is the series itself. All though it is short, those few words are still fun and nice but i would recomend Rowling's Quidditch and Beast books over this!
B000WGYMAQ|2.0|I'm not sure what classifies a Blu-Ray disc rather than a DVD disc but this movie is lacking in HD quality.  I would not recommend buying it on Blu-Ray, save money and by the DVD instead.
B004H6YVDK|5.0|This book was wonderful. I got it from my area library to read. I loved it and my brother purchased it for my Uncle Jack's 80th B-Day. He was a race car driver in his younger days (owned two original Shelby Cobras). He is an animal lover as well. I then went to Amazon and purchased a copy for my best-friend for her 54th B-Day. The book actually made me feel that Enzo, was actually thinking the thoughts that were written.It was very sad and moving in some parts and I cried. The ending however was wonderful. I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|Some day people will hear the anthemic ballad \\"Falling Slowly\\" and have absolutely no idea that it formed the emotional core of the most beloved film of the 2000s.     It's just that good a song...it really is.    Of course, there will also be future-cinephiles that discover John Carney's lovely music-film ONCE and find themselves awed by the discovery of so gorgeous a paean to romantic love tucked away in such an unassuming little Irish indie.    Indeed, ONCE is a film that most of us fell very quickly for, actually.    ONCE succeeds largely on the shoulders of its powerhouse songs...co-written and performed by its two stars, Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová. There is a story of course...two lonely souls fall in love while making beautiful music together...but make no mistake, ONCE is more concerned with connecting its relational dots with sweet melody, not pitch-perfect plotting.    In addition to the aforementioned \\"Falling Slowly,\\" other standout songs/scenes include the heart-pounding opening number \\"Say It to Me Now,\\" the soaring \\"When Your Mind's Made Up,\\" and the most heartbreaking break-up ballad ever, \\"Lies.\\"    I don't think I've ever seen a film that makes me feel more human, more hopeful, more loved...than John Carney's ONCE.
0743243153|5.0|I read this book more than a decade ago and decided to give it a second look.  I am so glad that I did.  It is as relevant today as it was so many years ago!
B0034G4P7G|2.0|THE SOCIAL NETWORK lacks any real stakes. Its narrative frame (the recording of various legal depositions) is a lazy solution to a very real exposition problem. And eventually the film collapses under the weight of its own \\"high concept.\\"     What is at stake in TSN? here is a matter of some millions due the \\"true\\" creators of Facebook...a question of authorship, I believe? And the super rich guy might lose a little of his riches to some other super rich guys. And it's a matter of pride, I believe? Honor at stake? Something like that...who cares? It's the MacGuffin. Doesn't matter. So..what is at stake? Zuckerberg's humanity? His...ability to exist in a true community? A real relationship? The rich irony of being the \\"creator\\" of the \\"social network\\" while still being...well, so damn lonely.     What is at stake for this socially retarded college kid with no friends? Is his mortal soul at stake? Might he crack and go on an Ivy League shooting rampage? I'd even take a \\"get the girl,\\" if...the character ever seemed like he wanted the girl or deserved the girl.     Spiritual emptiness may be a real stake in a Fellini film, but there is not one scene in TSN, not one line of dialogue, not a whisper of any existential reality beyond the glowing screen, the ivy-ensconced walls, the pulse of the club.      Imagine if Michel Gondry writes/directs this story. What fun! Or you want to camp out in the existential angst aspects? Go with Alejandro González Iñárritu. Or why not Neill Blomkamp or Peter Jackson? It's a technology story, let's let the tech guys handle it. Let them love it into existence.     Sorkin can't write real stakes. He doesn't do heart and soul. He does ambition and wonky political minutiae...the kind of small-room doings of men who think their brains are the uttermost reaches of the universe.     Ultimately, TSN fails because...well, see the famous trailer for the film. A children's choir singing Radiohead's \\"Creep.\\" When I saw it I was mesmerized. Until...I watched it again. And again...and...oh crap. This...this trailer...it's the movie! Watch that trailer again. It's the best short film you may ever see. It gets everything said that needs to be said about Zuckerberg's story across in less than three minutes. It's moving, thrilling, truly emotional. I cried the first time I saw that trailer. And...I cared. I cared about people like Zuckerberg...and you and I. A three minute short film was all we needed to fully grasp everything an Academy Award nominated feature film wants us to.     When I saw TSN, I felt the eggshell crunching in my hand. There was nothing more...nothing deep within, I hadn't already known or considered.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|This is a very well acted series and the stories are fascinating and the interactions with the characters is also very good.  LOVED IT.
B004P9FAK2|3.0|This Ultimate Edition is the LEAST ultimate of the current 6. Outside of no extended version of the movie, this is the first ultimate Edition to cheap out on the bonus material. The only thing new here is the \\"Creating Harry Potter Part 6\\" documentary, all other bonuses were on the previous Blu-ray/DVD Combo pack.<br /><br />And note that the Blue-Ray versions have dropped from 3 discs to 2 discs. We are getting WAY LESS for the same high price.  This is just a 2-disc release at a 3-disc price!<br /><br />Is it really worth paying twice as much for one additional documentary and a small hardback book?<br />This is the first Ultimate edition i will hold off on. At least 3,4,&5 had more bonus material to offer, making up for the lack of an extended version.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This movie with Cher was very good.  I loved all the dancing and the music and the characters were great too.  I rate it 5 stars.  Great.
0670022411|4.0|I stumbled upon this book by accident, and now I'm completely hooked. I'm nearing the end and I know I'm going to suffer withdrawls when I'm done. The characters are richly drawn and it's very easy to find yourself attached. I love the historical aspect of the story, and the fact that it's not a bawdy romance (vampires, witches, daemons...most authors think that equates a bodice ripper and nothing else). There is intelligence here, and adventure, and mystery. I'm hoping there is a long line of sequels because I am absolutely hooked on her writing style, and will be chomping on the bit until I can read more about these characters. Thank you for this literary addiction!

B0045HCJ94|5.0|This film is not only the famous couple's best film together, it is their best film individually as well. Watching the film more than once is suggested; the supurb poetry of the dialogue and monologues and the way they link together throughout the film are not to be missed.
B004SKEHP2|3.0|As a sum41 fan and going back and listening to the old stuff. I think this album is pretty damn amazing. They changed up the sound a bit on certain songs its pretty amazing.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|This is by no means a 1 star book! I really liked it. Granted it's not my favorite and it's a little slow in the middle but the ending is good!  When I finished reading it I didn't feel it was a waste of time or money. Which, in the end, says it all.
0439023513|4.0|I read a lot of negative reviews for Mockingjay prior to reading the book, so I was prepared to be a little disappointed.  Given my somewhat low expectations, I was pleasantly surprised with this conclusion to The Hunger Games trilogy.  I understand a lot of the complaints about the book (i.e. that the book devolved into the author's anti-war propaganda and that the love triangle's relationships were not satisfactorily resolved) but, that being said, I still really enjoyed this book and was satisfied with the ending.  Yes, I wish a little more attention had been given to wrapping up some of the character's story lines, but I think that the author is trying to make the point with this book that in life, and especially in war, things don't always get resolved and wrapped up in happily-ever-after-type endings.  Overall, I would recommend this series, and would suggest you not be discouraged by all the negative reviews.  I was not expecting to read a literary masterpiece when I picked up The Hunger Games trilogy, but rather, I was looking to be entertained, and I was not disappointed.
B00192IV0O|5.0|My son is a huge BEP fan and asked me for this CD. I took a listen sample before buying and decided to get it for him. Very danceable, Fergie can belt 'em out perfectly as always, just watch out for some obscene or suggestive lyrics on a couple of the tunes. All in all, though, I have to say this CD made me almost as much a fan as my son!
0439023521|5.0|I read this book in one sitting, and found it to be a very enjoyable, fast paced, and easy read.  After finishing the first book, I immediately had to start reading the second book in the series to find out what becomes of the characters.  The book is billed as 'young adult,' but I think it is entertaining for all ages.  **Spoiler Alert** After finishing the first book, I expected the series to continue focusing on the relationships, which were such a big part of the first book; however, the romantic relationships take a back seat in the second book and even more so in the third book, in which war and its effects become the main focus of the story.  I found the conclusion of the series to be satisfying, but the series definitely takes a darker turn than I expected based on the first book.  I enjoyed the whole series from start to finish and would recommend it, but I would warn readers not to expect a perfectly wrapped up happy ending (i.e. the Twilight series), or else they may be a little disappointed.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I was into this early. Not yet 17 and trying out a<br />psycho-delic lifestyle, Carole came to call.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|Looked forward to watching this movie after all of the awards and hype it received, but I found this movie to be very dark and disturbing rather than entertaining.  I would not waste my time watching it again, nor would I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a couple of hours of entertainment.  Of course, I have no problem with AMAZON...I order all the time, and my orders are always received timely and in good condition.  It is the movie itself that I am giving a 2 star rating!

1577314808|5.0|I'm an avid reader and have read many books, especially lots of \\"spiritual\\" or \\"self-help\\" (not fond of that moniker but I digress...) Eckhart Tolle's writing style is very easy to follow and he is very clear--he has the ability to convey potentially deep subject matter in a way that pretty much anyone can understand. The most important \\"a-ha\\" moment for me in the book is the chapter, \\"You are not your mind.\\" When we realize we are truly all pure consciousness, the awareness BEHIND thoughts and emotions, it is truly liberating and we don't take ourselves so seriously. I can't recommend this book any more highly! I also recommend \\"A New Earth\\" or anything by Tolle. In my opinion, he is right on the mark!
B000KIPT30|5.0|I bought this while I was deployed to Southwest Asia to use as a headphone amp for my bass guitar.  My bass guitar has an active amp, but as some of you may know, when you plug in headphones to such a bass, the volume is still a little too quiet.  This headphone amp has worked wonders for me--always works perfectly:  tight connections, no hiss and always a clear sound.  I plug my guitar into the input, and have the headphones in slot 3 (any available slot works great).  Plenty of volume despite keeping many of my bass preamp settings (bass, mid, or treble) below half power for some tunes I play.  Definitely worth every penny.
B004EC937G|4.0|Obviously her voice doesn't sound as good as on Rockferry.  At first I thought maybe this was how she always sounded but then I played Rockferry and saw the difference.  However, I do like this album and the songs. The more I hear it, the more I like it.  No talent skanks like Lady Gaga get all the attention while real artists like Duffy aren't heard of as often.  Duffy is a refreshing artists.  I wish there were more like her putting out real music.

B002BJGYV2|2.0|I was so excited to get the fifth season of Gilmore Girls in the mail! I thought surely this season would be better than the fourth season (which wasn't terrible, but had more cons than pros, in my opinion). But it's been a major disappointment. The only good thing about this season is that Luke and Lorelai are finally dating. Rory is no longer the smart, innocent girl we liked in the earlier seasons. Instead, she's only interested in trapping herself a boyfriend and sleeping around. Her relationship with her mom is extremely two-dimensional, and the witty banter that was such a delight in other seasons is now slow, lacking in references, and just plain boring. It seems the writers have exchanged the intelligence of the show for a soap opera feel.    While there were a few good episodes in this season, I wouldn't recommend buying the entire set. It just isn't worth it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I didnt think I was going to like this film..the concept sounded boring. I was so wrong..I walked out of the theater LOVING the film! Its not a movie easily explained..its the charachters (mostly Jeffery Rush) who really make you love this film! I say give it try..I dont know anyone who wouldnt love this film!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Hadn't listened to Adele before this album came out - heard of her but just hadn't heard anything but the hit off the first album - \\"Chasing Pavements\\".  She has a wonderful voice - mature way beyond her years - and while I love the whole album, her version of Lovesong is quite the most beautiful version I have ever heard. If I was drinking her, she would be a superb aged cognac!  Delicious.
0547258305|1.0|Im shocked at all the 5 star reviews this book got. I wouldnt suggest anyone waste money on this. Im not sure what it was that I didnt like. I think it was the way it was narated it just kept telling me what was going on with very little actual dialog from the characters. Its was very boring and I found myself skipping through paragraphs. I just didnt like it.  HELPFUL HINT: If you are thinking about reading this book, try the free sample of the first few chapters. It wasn't the story that I couldn't get into, it was the way it was narrated. So try the sample for yourself and see if you can stand the style of writing.
B0047Y17P2|3.0|I love love love most of Michael Connelly's books.  However, I didn't feel \\"glued\\" to this one like previous books.  I just found it to feel forced and wasn't very impressed.  I enjoyed the other three books in the Haller series much more.
1416550534|4.0|I liked 'The House at Riverton' it was full of interesting characters, the time period was well done, the events that unfold were compelling and the relationships between the characters were realistic.<br /><br />It has all the makings of a \\"favorite\\" for me and I did enjoy it but it also seemed to be lacking just a little something.  I think if greater attention had been paid to the relationships between Grace and her father, Grace and Hannah and Hannah and her sister Emmeline I could have loved this story.<br /><br />And while I did enjoy it, I don't feel that it lived up to my expectations or the hype around it.  The story is reminiscent of Daphne du Maurier, who I love, but Kate Morton is not quite ready to be compared the master of dark and twisty just yet, she needs to hone her craft a bit more before I'm ready to bestow such a lauded comparison.<br /><br />I will read more from this author with the hope that her other work has all of the enjoyable ingredients of this story but with greater refinement and detail to relationships.  Overall a good solid story that most readers will probably love.

0375758992|5.0|Alexandra Fuller spills the story of her life growing up in Africa. It is a tale of survival and growth against the odds.  Fuller has a style of writing that grabs you and won't let you put the book down. It is also a history of the Southern regions of an emerging nations where only the strong willed can survive.  Yet it is told from the memories of a child.  Intriguing.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|Having been introduced to the Decemberists only this year, in a Time Magazine article about this album, I wanted to wait a while before commenting.<br /><br />The first record I bought of theirs was \\"The Crane Wife\\", and I was hooked on the title track(s) and 'Yankee Bayonet' immediately. It's a strong effort and a good entry point for their work.<br /><br />I picked up \\"The King Is Dead\\" a week or so later, and I've been listening ever since. 'Turning Of the Season', the opener, is a fantastic country-rock song; track 3, 'Rise To Me' is a sweet, gentle ballad. 'Rox In the Box' and 'Down By the Water' are rockers, with the latter sounding almost like a cross between Dylan, and REM. 'January Hymn' reminds me of being a child, and 'Avery', the closer, is a brilliant closer.<br /><br />It's such a rootsy record, which to my ears sounds like quite a departure for this group. Don't get me wrong- they always had a folky sound, but on this l.p. they went all out. The songs here are also more focused than they were on, say, \\"Picaresque\\" or \\"Castaways and Cutouts\\".<br /><br />And because there doesn't seem to be a narrative running through this album, unlike \\"The Hazards Of Love\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"The Crane Wife\\", the individual tracks are free to tell their stories without the burden of having to fit into a storyline.<br /><br />This is a great album, and a good entry point for this group's work. However, Malloy's preoccupations with the English language and ghosts aren't present here, so you my be surprised when you move on to another of their releases. Don't let that put you off though- The Decemberists may be one of the most artistically important bands of the next 50 years.
B004FOA84A|4.0|except for a bug at the end (all 3 glowing dials won't open the door) I thoroughly enjoyed this hour-long adventure. not worth paying for, since I got it when Amazon offered it for free, but still amusing.
B0000CF35G|3.0|This album is called \\"McHeadbanger: over 20 million served\\" for a reason.  It's one of the all-time classics, no doubt.  However my review is not for the album itself but rather this LP pressing.  The LP is nice and on heavy weight 180g vinyl; something I'm glad to see the industry leaning towards.  However, the surface quality of the LP is rather dubious.  I fould the LP to have a lot of surface noise and light crackle.  I have a $1000 turntable setup with a $500 stylus, so I know a good pressing when I find one.  For example, The Van Halen I 180g reissue sounds absolutely dead quiet (another classic you should just buy now).  So I think there is definitely room for improvement on \\"Back in Black\\".<br /><br />Still, this LP issue does bring back the warmth and dynamics that are missing from the overly volume limited CD remastered edition.  Unlike the CD edition, the only thing overdriven here are Angus's guitar lines!  So if you can live with an more elevated amount of surface noise than you should get from a virgin 180g vinyl release, then this is the edition to get.  It helps that it doesn't cost an arm and a leg either...
B004FOA84A|4.0|I'm having a good time with this game. It does force close occasionally as some people are reporting. But it works fine most of the time on my Incredible. Very reminiscent of old time point and click pc games but with really nice looking graphics and fun though repetitive music.
B0036BDPOI|2.0|while I'm glad that vinyl is making a comback, I think we've reached the point where quality is taking a back seat to record company profits again.  If done right (Van Halen I), a vinyl reissue can dramatically improve the listening experience.  Unlike CD reissues, the levels on LP's are not pushed to the point of distortion in the never ending loudness wars.    Unfortunately even with a $1000 player and $500 stylus that is finely tuned, I found this pressing extremely difficult to track.  It took many times before I could capture this LP properly, and even then some takes were skipping in different locations.  Thankfully editing the audio on a computer allowed me to stich together a non-skipping version of the album.    The surface is relatively quiet, it isn't anywhere as good as the Van Halen 180g reissues, but it isn't as bad as AC/DC's \\"Back in Black\\" on 180g vinyl.  There is definitely improved warmth and bass on the LP versus the remastered CD version.  Some people say metal is just too loud and cluttered for LP, but I think if it is done right, it can sound quite nice.  The Metallica 45rpm releases (not the 33rpm versions) sound quite spectacular.    BTW, the \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" LP is so bad, I couldn't get much of anything to track at all.
B001DPC4TG|5.0|I'm an audiophile and have quite an investment in LP gear as well as computer gear so that I can capture my LP's in 24bit / 192khz glory.  This album is the best sounding, best pressed, LP reissue I have bought in 20 years.  It is so quiet that there is virtually no surface noise to be detected.  I never thought I would hear vinyl this clear and clean ever again.      As for the sound, let's just say that it blows away every CD issued, including the DCC Gold disc version.  The sound is warm and analog just like the original recording.  All the minute details are there without any of that horrible over compressed, volume limited sound most \\"loudness war\\" cd's have these days.  All you get is the sound the original artist intended.      I mean this 180g pressing sound so good that I'm litterally about to drool just thinking about listening to it again.  I feel like this album is a bell and I'm Pavlov's dog!  Mmmmm....
B004FOA84A|3.0|A fun, if short game.  It took perhaps an hour of actual play time to complete. Graphics are nice, but the game FCed once in a while, and continues to play sound even if the in-game volume and sfx settings are off.  Great as a freebie, but zero replay value.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|This was by far the best period for the Rolling Stones, with Mick Taylor on guitar, they never sounded so good, before or after.  Definitely a must have.  Marco Pennacchini.
B003L20ICE|4.0|\\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is a sweet, funny indie slice-of-life send-up of middle-class manners. A couple who've been together for a long time, whose elder child is about to leave for college, have their relationship threatened by an affair. If the couple did not happen to be lesbians, I doubt it would have generated that much buzz. Still, what the film does, it does quite well.    First, the acting is very strong. Annette Bening, playing the uptight control freak breadwinner half of the couple, Nic, does a great job; she earns her Oscar nomination. She shows the strain of keeping (or trying to keep) her more free-spirited partner Jules and their two kids, Joni and Laser, on track. She pays the bills for their comfortable upper middle-class lifestyle, superintends the submission of college applications and the writing of thank-you notes, and otherwise bears all the weight of responsibility in the family. \\"If it were up to you, our kids wouldn't even write thank you notes,\\" is a typical line she throws at her partner Jules. Nic does not react well to the intrusion into her domestic cocoon that takes place when her kids contact their sperm donor and gradually introduce him into their family dynamic. Marc Ruffalo as the charming sperm donor, still single and playing the field 20 years later and engaging with the kids more as a cool older friend than a parent, Julianne Moore as Jules, and the actors who play the two teens are all very convincing in their roles.    Second, the depiction of the drifting apart that leads to Jules's affair is pretty honest. It's not that Jules doesn't love Nic any more; it's just that after 20 years, things have gotten a bit stale and the couple's roles entrenched. Jules, a gentle, slightly fuzzy-around-the-edges soul who has been the stay-at-home mom and has never really settled into a career, feels unappreciated by the hyper-competent, bossy, intense Nic. When Jules finds someone who makes her feel passionate and desirable the way she is,she acts on it.    Third, the movie handles quite convincingly the awkwardness and push for independence that arrives as Nic and Jules's two teenagers come of age. They seem like real teenagers; basically decent but not overly perfect, intelligent, presentable but not over-pretty.    It's a rare movie that consists mostly of a series of uncomfortable encounters that feels truthful but does not make you feel so squirmy you want to run out of the room. The dialogue sounds like real people talking, and the actors play their nervousness with total conviction but without seeming fake or mannered.    The movie effectively if somewhat obviously sends up middle-class manners and expectations, with its visual and verbal humor about Volvos, high-octane parenting, varietal grapes, Pottery Barn-inspired decor, and organic local cuisine.    There's nothing earth-shaking here, but \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is an enjoyable, well-made comedy. For adults and older teens only, as the depictions of sexuality are quite graphic.
0316056863|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book! I've been laughing so hard. I'll be sad when it is over and hope she writes another one very soon.
0811876373|5.0|I thought the book was very well done and provided many decorating ideas. Visually the pictures provided great inspiration for new ideas. The book is a great addition to my decorating library.
B004J713JW|2.0|like so many, i'm a huge billy joel fan.  but his voice is just so off in this one (lots of sharp/flat notes) that it's hard to watch/listen.  some parts with the duets with others are fun though, but overall, very disappointed.
B00003CXB6|4.0|I watched JP trilogy again recently, with a friend that had not seen them or barely remembered since he was too young when they came out. Yes, the first one is a classic, nothing can compare or surpass the awe of the discovery of the park. My friend, who has been to the Orlando Jurassic Park ride many times was saying why they didn't do the ride just like the movie? And that summoned up my own feelings when I say JP for the first time: I wanted it to be REAL. Then it comes JP 2: Lost World, which, yes, the plot is not as good, the effects are better, but to be fair, it is a highly entertaining movie with some genius action sequences. The action scenes in JP series are usually layered: two or more things happen at the same time and there is an element of urgency, a time-clicking bomb alike plot device, and they make you feel like you are watching an accident in slow motion. In JP, examples are the T-Rex appearance, the car in the tree, electric wire climbing... there is always that clicking suspense. In Lost World, we have the trailer scene, which is very effective, it creates tension through motionlessness, you have a person still on a shattering glass, another trying to avoid an object to fall into it. New movies' action sequences are all about blurry, fast, suprising, explosive tricks that are ultimately boring and repetitive, that won't allow you to build suspense, to feel the tension. JP trilogy is filled with good old fashion suspense, every chaotic situation develops in front of your eyes adding layers of tension and builds slowly. In addition to this, all three movies have the signature mix of tension and humor that is typical of Steven Spielberg movies and started with Jaws, the dialog is not 'on the nose', characters don't ask stupid questions so the writer makes extra sure the audience understands issues about the plot, when they are scared they freeze and get quiet, not everything is a complete sentence, people don't say \\"a T-Rex is coming\\" but \\"this is gonna hurt\\". So, maybe we are being to harsh with the JP sequels and we forget that there are very few new movies today that will leave you wanting for more, that will have action sequences that are actually watchable and not just a blur, movies that create suspense, that use special effects to create a character, not for the sake of special effects only and with a story that will let you day dreaming afterwards.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I find this to be an extremely useful, friendly app. It finds youtube videos by keyword, downloads them, and even plays them for me!
B004FOA84A|5.0|Really enjoyed this game. The puzzles were not too difficult to solve without help but still required some logical thought. I wish the game was a bit longer, though. Definitely reminded me of an old game, &quot;the 7th guest&quot;, for those of you who have been around awhile.

0670824399|4.0|Anyone who has ever been a child stuck in an unfair situation -- and anyone who has an ounce of empathy for what that might feel like -- will appreciate this book. Matilda is a razor-sharp, witty, entertaining revenge fantasy.<br /><br />Dahl paints characters with exaggerated traits in the manner of melodrama: Matilda's slovenly, thickwitted, self-centered parents are super-obnoxious, her dastardly headmaster is super-awful and aims to make school a veritable fortress of humiliation and misery, even Miss Honey is super-sweet, super-patient and super-oppressed. This liberal sloshing-about style of characterization takes what might have been an unbearably hideous and painful story of abuse and trauma and transforms it magically into lively fodder for humor. Surrounded by and struggling with this outrageous cast, Matilda (herself a super-genius) is the most normal, levelheaded one of the bunch.<br /><br />Matilda is not only smart but inventive, resilient, and passionate in her quest for justice. Her larger-than-life difficulties provide the opportunity for a larger-than-life triumph: the disaster and sadism of Matilda's adversaries function in much the same way as Harry Potter's horrible adoptive family or Buffy Summers' high school social problems, as a framework for a wider narrative. This is not meant to be a realistic story but a colorful pastiche of the underdog coming out on top. Not without some reason, kids often feel like they have the short end of the stick, and Matilda's story is a way for them to identify with her satisfyingly silly and ultimately pretty harmless plans for revenge. Dahl delivers vividly and lovably.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|My daughter loves this movie!! We have watched it so many times. I had to own it because she kept wanting to rent it all the time.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is much preferable to the other PDF readers available.  Its a simple interface with all kinds of options if needed.  I like it very much and it is a good value if you read PDF documents often.  Adobe is OK, this is considerably better.
030746363X|5.0|I bought this book with the intention of learning how to gain more lean muscle mass.  I was a guy who would put in more time than everyone else and get less out of it.  After starting Occam's protocol 17 days ago I have gained 9 lbs after previously having to scratch and claw to gain maybe 2 lbs per month.  It's still not a magic bullet, eating is honestly at least 75% of it, as well as documenting your progress.  Five stars because I'm putting in less time and achieving a better result!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones have a very clean, detailed studio sound, yet are easily driven by an iPod, even a Nano. They sound really good with an iPod and a FiiO mini amp. They're not exactly pocket size, but fold down to be a reasonable inclusion in hand luggage. Not inconspicuous, but not too nerdy looking, at least at home. Not quite as sweet sounding as my AKG 340's from the 70's with two way speakers and electrostatic ribbon tweeters, but the Sony's don't require ten pounds of headphone amp and an extension cord. I have quite a few pairs of headphones, but I listen to these the most.
030746363X|5.0|Thank you Tim Ferris! This book's been my guide for almost three months now and I still find it the best dietwise. I hadn't been able to stick to a diet for more than two weeks before I read The Four Hour Body. Slow carb diet presented in the book feels like it's not a diet at all. I can't say anything about the sex part though - I'm not there yet:-) But sounds ... interresting.  The parts on fat-loss and exercizing are very helpfull. No carving, no snacking in between. And I love my binge days. It is trully the best diet ever! (Sorry for my not perfect English)
B000XR4OC0|5.0|So I heard about TOMS about 8 years ago when my favorite band HANSON started working with them while they did their The Walk album.<br /><br /> I got my first pair about two weeks ago and they are the BEST most comfy shoes I've ever worn! I'm wearing them right now (At work!) in the Black Canvas.<br /><br />They are super comfy and wear really well without any blisters or anything - and they breathe too. I wore them in the rain last weekend and they held up fine. :)<br /><br />My brother in law is getting married in July, and the whole bridal party is going to be wearing TOMS shoes!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|We used to watch Dr. Quinn every Saturday night and really enjoyed it, so owning the complete series is so much fun.  I read the reviews before I bought this and some people thought the packaging was poor, but I think it is fine.  Each season comes in a separate case that has about 8(?) discs stored back to back on plastic \\"pages.\\"  I suppose these \\"pages\\" would rip out if not careful, but I tend to be careful with DVDs.
B004G600A4|5.0|Mild spoilers ahead.    I loved this movie. While the princess retained the innocence so classic in Disney characters, she managed to remain interesting, and, honestly, it was refreshing to see a princess that could do a decent job of taking care of herself and a \\"prince\\" who wasn't automatically one of the best swordsmen ever. I especially enjoying how the weapon of choice was a frying pan. It is definitely a different approach to the classic, and also different in a brilliant way is that the noble steed did not actually belong to Flinn/Eugene and the princess' trusty sidekick was a small chameleon. Flinn/Eugene's voice actor also did a brilliant job of changing his tone of voice when his character was going back and forth between the dashing Flinn Rider and the caring Eugene Fitzherbert while not making it sound like our beloved \\"prince\\" had multiple personalities. All in all, the characters were engaging, even the silent Maximus and Pascal, the story managed to stay lighthearted while still retaining the conflict crucial to a good story, and the attempts at humor actually did end up being funny. I would fully recommend this movie.
0470449748|2.0|I just took the GMAT and it is much, MUCH more difficult than this book presents. If you study this book thinking it will prep you for the exam, you will be fooling yourself. I went into the GMAT thinking that even if I don't get a great score on the math, I will definitely get the verbal part, because the book made it look so easy. But it's not. Definitely take a class or just brush up using a real book on the topics the GMAT Covers (i.e. Algebra!) Skip this book. Waste of money.
0723257639|5.0|With a little bit of trepidation, I bought this set as a birthday present for my 6 year old grandson.  Now, at his request, we are curling up to read these every night.  Whether it is one we have already read or a new book, the Beatrix Potter books are his new favorites.   He has lived in a heavily Disney world here-to-fore and I think he must find these treasures to be a relief but, whatever the reason, he loves having the set and getting to choose a special charming adventure every night. We have a few still to read and are both looking forward to them.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|Nicole Conn and her amazing cast and crew have created one of the loveliest and most heart warming films I have seen in years. A beautiful story told by two beautiful women with an excellent cast of supporting actors, a well done score and great editing.
030746363X|4.0|This book is awesome with a few reservations.  So much of it makes sense. The natural cures for things like low T really work.  The diet is great and really works.  Some of the drug stuff is pretty scary as well as some of the appliances.  With age and time Tim Ferris will learn that it can all be done with a traditional foods diet and lifestyle.  he is so close to figuring it out and when he does it will be mind blowing!
B0042U94UQ|4.0|Hollywood animated films used to be predictable; good versus evil.  Shrek began something different; a movie about a supposed bad guy, Shrek, who turns out to be good at heart.  This began a gradual diversification of animated films to the point that in 2010, most of the highest-grossing cartoons did not have a uniformly evil antagonist.  Toy Story 3 explored the roots of Lotso's rage.  In Megamind, the villian turns into the hero.  And so in Despicable Me, we have a movie solely about bad guys competing to be who is the baddest of them all.  Voiced by well known comedians, this family friendly movie has a fairly large cast of characters of various shapes and sizes.  All get in their funny parts, some of which is dialog, and some of which is slapstick.  The overall movie pace is good, with both fast action scenes and slow scenes of character development.  Like any good movie, there is a lot of unpredictability.  The only thing missing was a good soundtrack.  Unlike Toy Story 3, Tangled, or How to Train Your Dragon, this movie's soundtrack was totally forgettable.  Overall, a good movie.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I just absolutely love this movie :-) Any girl who has ever mentioned she wants a fairytale will love it!!
030746363X|5.0|[[ASIN:030746363X The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]]  Buy this book. I have read almost every diet and fitness book and this makes sense and yields results. I look my best at 41 thanks to Tim. I am getting results that I didn't think were possible. Once I had reached my \\"goal weight\\", I continued on and lost 2% body fat in 4 weeks while maintaining the same body weight. Four Hour Body is an amazing book that can benefit every individual (in so many ways). Buy it and try it. It works.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow! This is absolutely the best $10 I have EVER spent! I have been doing this DVD workout for 4 days now and every single muscle is sore--in a good way :-) I am slightly overweight and this workout is simply amazing. It gets results fast. It is only 20 minutes per day, and you feel seriously accomplished after! I can't believe I didn't think of this sooner. Jillian is awesome at keeping you motivated and she even cracks a few jokes that really put you more at ease. I love love LOVE this DVD! As an F.Y.I you will need to get weights (3 lb. or 5 lb.) for some of her exercises. I can't believe that even my upper back is sore lol, it seriously works out every muscle :D
030746363X|5.0|So you've read the good reviews and the bad reviews. You're trying to decide if the 4HB is all hype or just the misunderstood redhead locked in the proverbial fitness closet.    Does it work for normal people who don't look like Ferris and his ilk?    It does and it especially works for women.     I'm fairly young [30] and I've been a fat child/teenager/young adult all my life. On top of that, I'm a sufferer of horrible PMS, fibroid tumors and hormone imbalance. When I went for surgery ALL of my physicians claimed I would never lose weight unless I had a hysterectomy.    So I tried every diet under the sun: veganism, vegetarianism, fasting, P90X, Weight Watchers; small losses but nothing major. I ran across Tim's site when he was doing the 'Slow Carb' movement. This was something I never read nor heard before so I tried it. Nearly 6 months later [month 3 is when the book actually came into print] I lost 50+ lbs and went from a 1X to a size 10. It's kinda nice going to your doom and gloom physician and having him question his sanity when the very thing he said isn't possible is bold on his own charts. Greatest feeling in the world! Telling him it was diet and exercise only? EVEN BETTER!     Ladies, if you have wicked cramps, PMS, Menopause, endo, fibroids and ovarian cysts, you are doing yourself a disservice to NOT try this book for a month. My tumors shrank considerably, my cycle went from 2 weeks of pain to 3 days of normality and even my Mother, who was on HRT because of her early menopause, has relief and is losing weight after a 30 year battle with the bulge.    After sticking to it for a while, I came to realize that the 4HB is a newbies guide to Paleo. If you start doing HIIT or something else more intense, you may want to switch gears and read [[ASIN:0982207700 The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy]] to take your eating to a new level. I also recommend watching [[ASIN:B001NRY6R2 Fat Head]]for adequate rebuttal material for the angry vegans, vegetarians and low-cal folks that come your way.    And believe me, they will. :)
B001UV4XUG|4.0|This was an awesome movie--very original yet anyone who has ever really liked another will relate. There is no booklet that came with the DVD which cost it one star lol. The movie and the actors are great!
0307272702|5.0|I used low carb dieting to lose substantial (50+ lbs) weight twice previously in my life - in the mid 1990's and again about 7 or 8 years ago. Both times I strayed from it and gained weight. I am the type of person that needs to know WHY something works, not just that it DOES work. I believed that low carb worked after I first tried it in the 90's. But then I got into more athletic endeavors and started eating carbs again because, well, that is what all trainers tell you to eat if you are an athlete. As soon as I reverted to eating carbs (I can see this pattern in retrospect) I began to have less energy for exercising. Thus began the downward spiral.<br /><br />This is where Taubes comes in. Having read his book, I now realize WHY I lost energy and stopped exercising so much. I can see scientific substantiation for the low carb approach to eating. I look around at what people are buying at the grocery store and am realizing that if this science is correct, we as a country, indeed as a species, are bound to become fatter and fatter, as well as more and more lethargic.  So three weeks ago I dove back into this way of eating with renewed enthusiasm. Now, 12 pounds lighter and feeling energized, I am committing to eating this way for the rest of my life. It beats feeling fat and lethargic. And now I know why.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|It took me a good 60 pages to get this book.  I put it down at page 30, and page 40, and all of the sudden, it's my favorite book of the year.  I'm part way through book #2 now.  If you like Pratchett, the Belgariad, etc it is not to be missed.  Read it, but don't be surprised if it starts out a bit slow.  the book is about lies, it takes a while for the first few to be revealed...
B0032700Q2|2.0|I'm only a late commer to GG and respect their music for its complexity and musicianship.  This is one of their last albums and is a sell out to the recording companies who wanted 'pop' tunes.  If you like their previous albums, don't waste your time on this one. Lots of simple 4/4 tunes and little to recommend it.
030746363X|5.0|I'm half way through the book.  I was never able to see my abs before, now I can. :)  I read thought the 1 star reviews and they are generally written by people outside the curve, or critical without reading it, or complaining it's too hard. There are no silver bullets and this book does not claim to be. It is a fun, resource filled read. If this book takes off a bit more, I would like to see controlled studies on the diet and exercises he reccomends. I would have liked a few more statistics on results.
B000QCS8TW|1.0|Clearly Mr. Martin has learned his Hollywood lessons well.  Every chapter draws you in with some exciting plot twist and leaves you hanging on the edge of the page wondering how things will work out.  But there is no humor, nothing to learn about the human condition other than life is nasty, brutish - and best over with quickly.  When I finish a reading session, I feel like I have eaten the whole box of See's candy.  It sure tasted good, but I am sorry that I even started.  I gave my books to the local library - and did not even feel good about that.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This is the third and sadly final book in the Stieg Larsson trilogy of Lisbeth Salander. It's got great unexpected plot turns and good characters, just as the first two books. I highly recommend that you read them all, and it's a MUST to read them in order. I only wish we were able to read more of these people - you get involved and want to know how their lives go. I listened to two of the three books, and found it was much easier to listen due to the difficult place names since I am not at all familiar with the Swedish lanuage. But don't let that put you off, these books are great. They are gritty, and have some violence in them that is part of the story line.....it's not there just to please the masses.
B004FQKY5Q|4.0|I think Roxette is always going to produce great albums. They sing too well and Per is too talented for them not to. But I don't think they will ever reach the heights of some of their earlier work. There is nothing epic here that stands out as excellent. But nothing is dreadful either. It is all really nice catchy pop and mostly ballads, with more duets between Per and Marie. Per handles more lead vocals than usual, having a more or less equal amount as Marie, whereas on all other albums Marie sung the majority.  The best tracks for me are 'Speak to me' an instantly memorable melody and nice string parts and the last track has some nice, ambient synths 'sitting on top of the world'. There are other really great songs.  The only one that is a little irritating for me is 'after all', as I can't stop thinking it sounds just like REM - Everybody hurts, and that kind of ruins the songs for me.  Still, highly recommended, just don't expect any 'Love is all' or 'Queen of rain'.
B00006EXL5|5.0|As the first release from MCR, it's been one thats been looked over by more recent fans.<br />The writing is genius. The music is genius and it's by far one of my favorite albums by them.

B004UID2LC|5.0|i love this app, it is great for those few special youtube videos. i dont suggest downloading alot of videos but nice to have at least ten on hand when you dont have an connection for some reason. htc evo
B001FOPODS|5.0|My testimonial: I have no connection WHATSOEVER in ANYWAY to this product other than as a consumer.<br /><br />Some complaints, like the low rating ones here and others I've read elsewhere, hinged on the notion that because this version of \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" does not follow the original story line, it is therefore less worthy, and to this I say...<br /><br />For whatever reason the original was made, this stop motion animation is superb, a masterpiece in its own right.  Do we care what the original purpose or reason for the atom bomb was?--No, as we now use nuclear power in many different ways than the original purpose.  Does it matter that we do not build our modern home like the original mud and stone design?--No, we created new versions of mud buildings.  The original version of this story exists and for those who cannot appreciate different expressions of the original, then please stick with the original--but don't knock this one down.  This modern version of Prokofiev's \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" is a beautiful piece, pain stakingly done--no one, despite their preference for whichever version of the story would deny this fact, so give credit where credit is due.<br /><br />The accurate review for this version of \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" would be: This piece contains the most beautiful stop motion animation work I have ever seen; the story line is not the same as the original but the stop motion craftsmanship is extraordinarily fine and I love it for that; the focus of this version is more on the animated art form with Prokovief's music in the background.  As you watch the animation you get mesmerized by the claymation artists' skills: the expressions are fluidly delivered full with emotional meanings in all the characters.  Making a piece of clay tell you he is hurt, sad, angry, happy, etc., without using words takes exceptional skills--I was in awe, because I couldn't believe the life that came from those clay figures--and all done without words.  This skill-set and the beautiful music created a universal film able to reach into everyone's mind and heart without the barrier of language.  This is the beauty in this piece of work that the die-hard-original-version lovers missed or ignored.  As an adult I love this short film (I wish it was longer)--the kids I saw it with ages 5 and 13 were fine with the content.  They were not scared as in scary; they felt its realism--no different than a realistic Nature film. (I can't speak in this regard for all kids so you have to figure that out for yourself.)  This version is a lovingly well made film and the quality reflects the extra ordinary skills of all the artists involved in making this artistic expression of a story. When purchasing this dvd look for the ones with the extras it really gives an insight into this art form.
B004L79VUI|2.0|I love The Band. Robertson's contributions to the group were huge. Songwriting, guitar playing, vision, leadership... all major reasons for the success and legend of The Band.    But as a solo artist, as another reviewer noted, his songwriting is hackneyed, a cliche. And pretentious. His voice is cartoonish, a very poor emulation of Tom Waits' singing style. I bought (and sold) his first solo record, but I still like to look him up to see if that old brilliance will ever shine. He's lucky to know Martin Scorsese for the film work, because his recordings are terrible.     Sorry Robbie, even getting Clapton, U2, etc for your records do not make great songs.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I watched the movie almost 3 wks after I received it...it kinda skips towards the middle, but I dont think I can return it?  Anyways...what a great twisted perfectly acted movie...if you can appreciate a devoted style of dance with great acting skills and a touch of comedy flare with a dark side-this is the movie for you!
B0018LX9T4|4.0|This item arrived ahead of the expected delivery date (always a bonus). This is a pretty great movie. A few over the top moments but I think that's what movies are about really.
0399208534|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. As a child I would read this book on a daily basis and now as a parent I read it to my children every night. They love the colorful pictures and the caterpillar becoming a butterfly. I would purchase this book over and over again.

I can't find any online help with this and the best I got from Amazon is that they don't know what is going on and I should call them to resolve the issue. I don't want to call them, I want an app that works correctly.<br /><br />Great idea but the app isn't ready for prime time.
0439023521|5.0|this is no doubt my favorite book. Ever. i absolutely loved everything about it. it is a bit violent at times and tragic, but even that fits perfectly into the story line. Suzanne's writing was brilliant and it was like you were watching everything instead of just reading . i got sucked into every word and never lost interest for a second. Katniss was smart and courageous and i loved her as a strong female lead. i felt like i was right  with her every second and actually really started to care for her well being. the hunger games is raw. whats great about this book is there is no boy meets girl they fall in love happily ever after. yes there is a bit of endearment between them and even a love traingle of sorts between gayle and peeta and katness. but its because of the utter hellish experience that they go through together that brings them close as they look after each other. there is honestly not one bad thing about this book. its flawless.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|As usual in nearly every BBC-HD blu-ray, the documentary is excellent, we think that with the same quality of \\"Planet earth\\" (or even better). It is worthy to spent money in this product if you have an HDTV and, of course, you feel some attraction by nature documentaries. The narrator is an important aspect to be taken into consideration in the purchase.
1400052181|2.0|I must say that I am perplexed by all the 5 star reviews and wanted to write this review to give some needed balance and perspective.  I feel as if the author invested so much time, energy and money into a research and writing project that she couldn't let it go even after it turned out that her subject wasn't all that interesting.  My favorite sections focused on the science and scientists involved with the HeLa cells but I found the family-focused sections incredibly boring.  The sad truth is there is nothing compelling about Henrietta's family (at least the way the author has written it) and in fact, they are annoyingly self-centered, self-righteous, uninformed and, at the end of the day, extremely unappealing.  And why does she have to interject her own experience in researching and writing this book into it?  She seems intent on showing everyone how hard she worked and how patient she was in dealing with her difficult subjects (e.g. the family) but really, who cares? I want to read about her subject, not her.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I love this series, i suggest olso \\"Spartacus Gods of The arena\\" waiting for the secon season.  An Advice: I've no found in the film details but It's Region is 1/A For USA only.
B0036TGSIK|3.0|Outside of a spectacular star turn from Emma Stone, I can't say that `Easy A' is all that exciting really.  It kind of reminds me of a cheap rip off of 2004's `Saved', yet nowhere near as witty or memorable.  The film revolves around a young girl named Olive who is almost too quick to lend a helping hand to a friend.  When her `not yet out' friend Brandon asks her to fake-sleep with him in order to establish a `straight' presence in the school, she agrees.  After that she gets asked countless times to `lend her services' to others who want an ego boost.  Sadly, this completely ruins her reputation despite the fact that she hasn't actually done anything she's claimed to.  Things get out of control, she loses her best friend and winds up being taken advantage of by someone she really liked.  Obviously things work out for her, but getting there just doesn't feel fresh at all.  Thankfully, Emma Stone is so chuck full of charisma and attitude that she sells EVERY scene she's in.  In fact, she gives probably the best comedic performance of last year, despite starring in a subpar comedy.  Amanda Bynes (oh god how I once loved you) is a regrettable stereotype and Lisa Kudrow isn't given nearly enough screen time.  I loved the Tucci/Clarkson parental combo, but I just wish they had more to do.  In the end I was baffled by the countless structural ripoffs here (I mean really, watch `Saved' and tell me that this film didn't try to copy it nearly verbatim) and can't really understand the love, unless that love comes from a blinding adoration for the film's star.  In that case, I totally understand!

B002ZG9800|4.0|The thoroughly entertaining and easily watchable `I Love You Phillip Morris' may not seem like your typical Friday Night Fare, and for some of you the blatant homosexual themes will probably be a major detractor, but one thing that this film has going for it is a tendency to push the envelope and a fearless spirit, which only helps to sell us on the film's overt ridiculousness.  Oh yeah, and it's kind of based on a true story.  Jim Carrey, comedian extraordinaire, tackles one of his most outlandish roles to date; that of Steven Russell...a successful business man turned con-man after an accident causes an epiphany that forces him out of the closet and into the `very expensive' lifestyle of the gay and the proud.  His cons catch up with him though and soon he finds himself in jail.  There he meets the soft spoken and instantly adorable Phillip Morris.  For the love of his newfound `friend', Steven continues his cons in the pursuit of real happiness with the love of his life.  Love is tricky though, and so is conning.  Jim Carrey sells every scene.  He's always had a knack for the extreme, and he definitely takes this character to the extreme.  It was Ewan McGregor that really nailed it for me though.  The way he handles what could have been nothing but a stock character (dimwitted yet suffering significant other) is truly great.  He captures the naivety needed to draw us into Phillip, and his soft-spoken demeanor is both an ode to the lifestyle and a play on the film's apparent `stereotypical' understanding of it.  The script is sharp, as is the film's pacing.  They cover a lot of ground in a short time, yet it never feels rushed.  I do think that it goes a little too `Farrelly Brothers' at times with the gags, but when it plays it straight it gets it just right; no pun intended.

B004IFYMWK|4.0|Telling the true story of CIA agent Valerie Plame, `Fair Game' gets a lot of things right.  I personally haven't seen `Nothing But the Truth', the 2008 adaptation of this account, but from what I hear this particular film is the better of the two.  While I still feel that the first half of the film is too long (it outweighs the second, arguably more important act, and so it should have been trimmed) I can't really fault the film for it definitely builds a strong, and certainly tense, structure from start to finish.  Both Naomi Watts and Sean Penn are in fine form, but it is definitely Watts who carries this film.  You can feel the emotional exhaustion dripping from her face.  The story is poignant and controversial, and one that all Americans should pay attention to.  Valerie Plame was compromised thanks to her husband's blunt opinions, but the lengths went to in order to cover up a governmental illegality was corrupt beyond words.  The strength of the Plame family, while not always understood, is commendable and something we all can learn from.  This is a (recent) biopic that shines and sucks the audience in from the very start.

Chances are, there's something about the nature and structure of that particular activity that makes it pleasant and enjoyable. Flow is Csikszentmihalyi's inquiry into the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />The process takes him far and wide, from the major world religions, to cultural anthropology; philosophical systems to sociological studies. The objective is to identify how to be happy in life and in respect of the formal academic process, the book is rife with footnotes and citations. This would be a great choice for the rational, left-hemisphere dominant personality. You know the type, they're the ones with the intellectual curiosity, who don't take things at face value and check the references out for themselves.<br /><br />The first edition is over 20 years old now, and the last couple decades have witnessed a dramatic culture-wide slide from the positive, or happiness side of the scale (the autotelic), to the negative, or unhappiness (entropy). Factors identified as negative - meaning they increase unhappiness, are expanding, and becoming ingrained. There's a story in the news today about a paper written by University of Kentucky Psychology professor Nathan DeWall titled \\"Narcissism and implicit attention seeking\\", which finds narcissism has increased exponentially over the past 30 years. As factors increasing unhappiness become normalized, than the argument in favor of deviation (following Mihaly's recommendations) becomes increasingly compelling.<br /><br />\\"We are in the process of creating what deserves to be called the idiot culture.

0316069353|5.0|Clever plot, believable characters, and enormously entertaining.<br /><br />Did diminutive Lisa Trammel kill the very tall Mitchell Bondurant by striking him on top of the head with a hammer, or was she set up? This question becomes embedded in Chapter Two and persists until Chapter Fifty-two, several hundred very interesting and well-written pages later. The trouble is, her lawyer Mickey Haller doesn't like Lisa's personality. She's his most difficult client because she won't comply with his instructions, she's controlling and she's overly assertive. This conflict alone made the story tantalizing, but there's plenty more conflict throughout.<br /><br />Connelly writes for all readers in much the same way that Haller explains how to talk to a jury in Chapter Forty-five: \\"I don't ever say you have to talk down to a jury but you do have to talk in ways that are universally understandable. From stockbrokers to soccer moms, there are twelve minds on the jury and they've all been marinated in different life experiences. You have to tell them all the same story. And you only get one chance. That's the trick. Twelve minds, one story. It's got to be a story that speaks to each of them.\\"<br /><br />And, Haller gets burned, early and often, both in the courtroom and out. Chapter Forty-seven: \\"When you're a defense lawyer you have to be like a corner back. You know you're going to get burned from time to time. It's just part of the game. So when it happens you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and forget about it because they're about to snap the ball again. We gave them a touchdown today -- I gave them a touchdown. But the game's not over, Jennifer. Not by a long shot.\\"<br /><br />A former newspaper reporter, Connelly possesses in-depth knowledge of the law and its nuances. He understands how a good defense lawyer would persevere and he has a lot of inside knowledge about the legal system (and how a fair judge would behave). This novel is full of \\"legal think,\\" courtroom strategies and lawyers \\"sandbagging\\" (a term he uses often) each other. Chapter Thirty-seven: \\"It was a good strategy but this is where I intended to turn her plans upside-down. In the courtroom there are three things for the lawyer to always consider: the knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns.\\"<br /><br />Last, but not least, astute readers can figure out whether Lisa is guilty or not by thinking about her testimony a few pages into Chapter Thirty-nine and putting it together with Arslanian's testimony a few pages into Chapter Forty-three. Connelly gives readers the raw materials and the opportunity to solve the case before the final reveal.andbagging\\" (a term he uses often) each other.

B00004CY5Y|3.0|WhenI saw this film in the theater it was a longer version than the 105 minute DVD. At least one song -Hanky Panky- was cut, and the movie was toned down in adult content to a more general audience rating. Unfortunately, a lot of the plot vanished with the missing scenes. The movie is still OK, but it was better, and it is a shame to lose any of the music.

030746363X|4.0|I heard about this book on the Nerdist podcast with Chris Hardwick.  One of his podcast buddies, comedian Matt Mira, has been having great success on the Slow-Carb diet.  I've tried many versions of carb-tweaking diets--Carb Addicts, South Beach, and so on--and I know their benefits.  So I decided to read the book and see what it was about.  I think the best description is a compendium.  There are several books inside this book, and not everyone needs to read everything.  So, as a 44-year-old mother struggling with the same 50 pounds for the past 8 years, I focused on the information that was pertinent to me, namely the weight loss and basic workout tips, plus the chapter on the Total Immersion swimming technique.  I haven't yet begun to follow the program but I must confess, this is the first time I have felt so inspired in YEARS.  I actually feel like perhaps I could reverse my body's current inertia and reinvent myself physically.  I could really go from fatass to badass!<br /><br />My greatest criticism is that much of the other advice is directed at heterosexual American men in their twenties.  Only a very few tips seem to have women specifically in mind.  For instance, Tim has a really interesting chapter where he talks about the nutritional program he followed to up his testosterone levels.  Nothing similar was suggested for women--what hormone levels should we be aiming for, and what supplements might take us there?  And of course the chapter on the female orgasm, while interesting, was written completely from the perspective of a heterosexual man.  Why should every man on the planet learn to give a woman an orgasm?  What about men who aren't interested in women?  What about the women who don't want to lie down for 15 minutes while a man \\"pleasures\\" them?  It seems like the underlying assumption here is that male-female relations are a mystery that needs to be \\"hacked\\" while same-sex relations are completely self-explanatory (something any Dan Savage reader could refute!).<br /><br />But these criticisms aside, I think there is an awful lot of solid, well-thought-out information on how to improve our health and nutrition in here.  Tim's enthusiasm is contagious, and the book very clearly refutes the notion that getting into shape has to be punishing and awful.  For that reason alone, it's worth taking a look at it.  Fatass to badass, here I come...fute!).    But these criticisms aside, I think there is an awful lot of solid, well-thought-out information on how to improve our health and nutrition in here.

B004L79VUI|1.0|I am normally inclined to quietly forgive a weak effort, even from an artist I respect and expect more from. But this is different - not only was Robbie a member of the best North American band of the rock era, he has marketed this album (or has allowed others to do so) with a direct appeal to the legacy of The Band. I saw The Band in its original formation several times, including once with Dylan, and their music has informed most of my own musical journey since that time.     When I now read in the popular media that Robbie was a \\"leader\\" or \\"founder\\" of The Band, I want to cry tears of rage (sorry, Bob). The Band, in fact, evolved from earlier incarnations that originally did not include Robbie; if they were \\"founded\\" at all, it was through the graces of one Ronnie Hawkins and, to a lesser extent, his young Arkansas drummer named Levon Helm. If, despite their explicit group identity, they ever had a leader, it was certainly not Robbie. First there was Ronnie Hawkins and The Hawks, then there was Levon and The Hawks, then Bob Dylan and The Hawks. As The Band, their identity was clearly rooted in the gritty southern identity of Helm. Robbie was, to be sure, a brilliant guitarist whose ensemble playing was revelatory, and he was credited with writing many of their songs, some of them among the most iconic songs of their time. Helm's disagreement with the provenance of some of those songs - and he makes no secret of his animosity toward Robbie to this day - is borne out by the lack of anything remotely as interesting as The Band's music in Robbie's subsequent work. Of course The Band, without Robbie, was similarly unable to approach their earlier brilliance in later work also. And, sadly, Robbie will not accept the reality the he simply can not sing a lick. One can only imagine what might have happened had Robbie moved on and forged a career based on his brilliant guitar playing, instead of trying to be the singer/songwriter he never was.    I found this album to beso bland and \\"middle of the road\\" that I could barely get all the way through it. There is nothing here, beyond some cheap, self-serving lyrical references, that invokes The Band, either musically or historically. If that's what you're looking for, you should, as others have pointed out here, check out the recent award-winning albums by Mr. Helm. Or better yet, go to Woodstock on a Saturday night and check out one of Levon's Midnight Rambles, the concerts that he puts on at his home recording studio. There the spirit of The Band is alive and well, and you'll even hear some of \\"Robbie's songs\\" performed with the authenticity and passion that you remember. Robbie wrote songs like \\"The Weight\\" and \\"Dixie\\". Levon owns them.    Robbie would be well served by forgoing - or asking his handlers to forgo - attempts to evoke The Band in his solo work. Being a brilliant guitarist and successful songwriter should be enough. And please, Robbie, remember they (allegedly) used to turn your microphone off when The Band performed for a reason.
030746363X|3.0|4HB is a big book, and few people need more than one chapter of it's contents. For me, I was interested in muscle gain, for my girlfriend it was the advice on losing some weight. She tried the low carb diet, stayed true to it, hated it, and saw very small results. I found success. I have been training on and off with weights and various workouts for 19 years, and never found anything to help with packing on much muscle. I'm naturally trim with good shape, but could never get above 155lbs - at 5'8\\" - and even at that weight my stomach would look bloated. I knew about low-volume, high-intensity training, but the super minimalism of it was never attractive to me. How could such little training work? Well, thanks to The 4HB, I ate bigger and trained less. Most people who can't gain muscle really over estimate how much they eat. It's hard to eat enough to gain if you are an ectomorph, but the body does adapt to the high calories. And it's hard to put everything you've got into one set per exercise for an all-out 7 reps. Results = gained 20lbs of muscle, most of it in the first 2 months. Amazing.
B004I4H8QS|4.0|Disc One is the original album, a stone-cold classic, remastered yet again. The music is a bit louder, with stronger bass and slightly less dynamic range, compared to the 2004 reissue (CD/SACD hybrid). Does it sound better than previous CD versions? Maybe a little bit, but not enough in my opinion to repurchase the disc if you're not picky about sound quality, or if you already own the 2004 remaster and don't want the bonus tracks.    Disc Two has the bonus tracks - the real reason to consider buying this reissue. It's nice to have all of the extra Dominos studio songs from the Crossroads box set on one disc, and the remastering is a big improvement over the Crossroads set. Of the Johnny Cash Show songs, I like It's Too Late and Matchbox the best; in my opinion, Got to Get Better and Blues Power are better on the Live at the Fillmore album.    My big complaint is that Polydor left out the original studio mix of Got to Get Better from the Crossroads box. Disc Two is only 58 minutes long, so it would have easily fit on the disc. Bobby Whitlock's new keyboards and backing vocals on the remix are fine, but the solo guitar track is pushed to the right stereo channel and somewhat obscured by the new keyboards and vocals. In my mind, the solo guitar track is the key to what makes this song great, and it's a shame to hear it buried beneath the extra layers of sound. Including the original studio mix would allow listeners to compare the two versions and decide for themselves.    Overall, a nice package for folks willing to spend the money, with one major oversight. However, I think most casual Clapton or Allman fans would be happy with just the original album. Also FYI - there are no new liner notes, but that's not a problem for me.

0007179731|3.0|Mr. Sharma has managed to fill his book with more clichés than a gruyere wheel has holes. Yes, I thought I'd add flavour to my review ;-)  Like stench that one tends to no longer notice after basking in it for a while, I somehow managed to plough past the first 100 pages or so. A few more pages and many more platitudes onwards, I noticed he had first published \\"The monk who sold his Ferrari\\" as early as 1997. A definite plus point in his favour; he's less than five years older than me, and in 1997, I had not yet heard of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or even Osho! let alone compile a book with so many examples and an overriding philosophy tying them coherently.  Perhaps back then, his book would have not left me with such a commercial aftertaste, though the list of seminars and workshops he offers at the end of it would have been a good indication. And I would have probably espoused his views on the ideal life, as being one of marriage and children, more readily. With all what I have seen and experienced since the said year, I no longer put much strength when arguing any social value or system. What works for Mr. Sharma certainly did not work for Buddha or Jesus, who kept themselves from spending quality time with their respective families (they may not have married but I could not be certain they never had children) on their way to `lasting happiness'.   Admittedly, I did come across a few stories, parables and advice within the book that were new to me.   Overall, I finished his book with a positive sentiment, having even picked-up on a couple of good tips to take into my everyday life.  A quick shout-out to my ex-colleague Jocelyn who gifted me the book as I was leaving my previous employer.

B000F6IOC0|1.0|When you get 99 reviews that are 3 stars or less, you know something is wrong. From the opening unintelligable back-story, to the final moment in the sun, this movie is just silly. There is silly dialogue, and my personal favorites - a helicopter that creates no downdraft, and ocean water that always moves in slow motion (to try and disguise that it was filmed in a tank).    Only Kate Beckinsale prevents this from being a stinker. She can't rescue it, but whatever watchability it has comes from her. The screenplay does everything it can to ambush her.

This is a really funny book.  Several times I've had to stop reading it in public because I couldn't stop laughing and looked like a crazy person.

B000BQV52A|5.0|I recently purchased this set of Friedrich Gulda's performances of the Beethoven piano sonatas and concertos and was astonished.  I would give it seven or eight stars but Amazon holds one to five.  I own Brendel's set (the one from the 1990's, though I have some discs from his 1960's set, too) and have listened to numerous interpretations of various sonatas by many pianists over the years--love Serkin's Apassionata, for instance.  Nevertheless, I was not prepared for the playing on these discs.  It is common knowledge that Gulda had amazing technique and there is no question that he is at the height of his powers here.  Invariably, he takes the sonatas faster than Brendel but the playing does not seem hurried or forced.  Indeed, the feel is almost 'organic' in that upon listening one thinks, \\"yes, that is exactly how that was meant to be played.\\" None of us has ever heard Beethoven perform these works, but he was described by contemporaries as a 'brilliant' player, sometimes sacrificing accuracy for effect. Gulda gets the effects with accuracy.  I think Herr Beethoven would have approved.  And Gulda never seems near his limit but puts his immense technique at the service of the music.  I certainly don't mean to denigrate Brendel.  His interpretations are thoughtful and his playing is of a high caliber.  Had I never heard the Gulda, I would tell others (actually I have) that Brendel is the best set to buy.  I could not say that now.  Because Gulda takes the faster movements rather fast, the slow movements seem slower when they are actually played at about the same tempo as Brendel, thus creating a sense of greater expansiveness, less compression.  These are performances that are, to my ear, 'right' in a way that  leaves Brendel's merely scholarly and 'correct'.  Finally, this set also offers the piano concertos.  Though none cracks my personal 'best of' list--Kempff for Nos. 1&2, Graffman on RCA for 3, and Serkin's 1960's version on 5--Gulda's stand up well.  This is a great set at a great price!  Don't hesitate to buy it.s a great set at a great price!  Don't hesitate to buy it.

B003ZDZ1WG|3.0|I loved \\"You Lie\\" and also \\"If I Die Young\\", but to me the rest of the CD is at best flat.    I'm more of a country-pop and modern country fan, and this CD for me has too much of a bluegrass / hillbilly /folk sound.  Now, there is nothing wrong with that, but it just isn't my style.  Aside from the 2 hits, I find most of the other material cringe-worthy to average.      I'm going with 3 stars cause to me it is close to average as a whole.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|I generally agree with the positive reviews I have read.  There is ambiguity in the movie which many viewers were uncomfortable with.  For me the ambiguity worked, after all we are seeing the movie through the eyes of a young woman who is unprepared for the world she finds herself in and who is increasingly unable to distinguish between what is real and what is not.  The problem I have with the movie is the Matting - it is too course and extreme. It continually pulled me out of the movie.  Maybe if I had a larger TV (presently a 32\\" 1080P LCD) or swithed to a standard DVD, the picture would be more mat and less course grain.  Other than the matting, I loved the movie and Natalie Portman's performance. None of the other reviews which I have read have mentioned a similar problem with the extreme matting.  Am I alone?
1595141715|5.0|As an educator, in a high school no less, I find this book very intriguing. Suicide is not by any means a rational decision anyone makes. For Hannah, trying to make sense of her life through the audio tapes was also not rational, albeit, an interesting approach. And though suicide is not a rational decision, it is often very thought out. Very few people wake up one day and say ok, I am going to kill myself. Just as Hannah did in the book, she thought about it, contemplated it, looked for an out, looked to someone to tell her to stop. And, all the little hints and clues she gave were ignored.     People often wonder why people commit suicide and if there was anything they could have done to prevent it. I think Jay Asher does an excellent job of walking us through the thoughts of a teenager.   Everything in the life of a teenager is an event, whether traumatic or inspiring. Our most precious memories come from when we were young. I think mostly because everything had an impact on us during those precious teenage years. I can see how many teenagers would not like this book. They consider themselves invincible, out to conquer the world, out to live life. They often do not think about the consequences their actions can have on others. They do not see themselves as the cause of anything negative in someone else's life.     I love how Asher ties all of Hannah's life events together. We may not think of them as life changing and reason enough to commit suicide as adults. But, how many teenagers think rationally! He emphasizes the fact more than once that there was not one specific event that led her to her decision to commit suicide, but a barrage of events that she felt were strangling her, keeping her from living. I really like the tie in with Clay and how he \\"lives\\" the life of Hannah through the tapes, he feels her pain. I think that every person should read this book, young or old. It gives parents an insight to how teens think, it gives teens insight into how other teens think. I hope this book makes you think about how you treat others and how that could have an effect on them. It makes you realize that something you may do or say that is small in your world is big in someone elses. Read, think, pay it forward.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|It's spring 2011, this is still one of my favorate, most listened to album in my car!  I can listen to it over and over and over again!  You've seen the movie so you can understand why.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|We had the VHS version of this movie and ejoyed it very much and had watched it many times.  Decided to buy the original uncut version,  what a joy, so much more to it , not the least bit boring,  just so much action,  sad the way it ended after all the trouble the sub mariners had and managed to get through it all. It has to be my favorite movie of all time.  Watch it in German with English subtitles,  unless you understand German.   Highly recommended!!!!

B004TE6F66|4.0|This book picks up where Shiver (Wolves of Mercy Falls) left off, with Sam supposedly healed. One of the new wolves is introduced as a point of view in the book, Cole, who casts an intriguing element into the plot-line as he has a completely different perspective on being a wolf than Sam does. Cole is a contradiction in other ways as well, as he is a druggie rock star wanting to escape life who also happens to possess a genius intellect thanks to a scientist father. He has immediate chemistry with Isabel, too. At first I was baffled by this pairing, but based on personality and intellect, these two mesh well.<br />Isabel also features heavily in this book. Even though she has attitude to spare, I rather like her, both for her sarcasm and for her brains. Sam and Grace never really seem too curious about the science and mechanics behind the wolf-human changes, but neither Isabel nor Cole can stop obsessing over it, though for different reasons.<br />As for Grace, now it's her turn to be the focus as she gets sicker and sicker, living in denial of what this illness relates to. Her and Sam both seem to have the mindset that if one ignores the problem, it will just disappear. I never liked that sort of approach - it seems cowardly. Really, their \\"epic romance\\" would just be another tragedy if it were not for the practicality of their friends, Isabel and Cole. In the case of this series, the lesser characters seem to carry the plot instead.<br />As for Sam, I found I enjoyed his random song lyrics and poems most of all. They lent a certain lyrical element to the book and added in the strength of emotion to pull me into the plot. Though poetry is not always the easiest thing to understand, his few simple lines interspersed throughout the text conveyed much more of what the characters were experiencing than a lengthy description could. I look forward to the conclusion of the series, Forever (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 3).

B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth leads a cast of actors that brings me back to when movies were meant to have outstanding merit. I have learned that Colin studied \\"how to stammer\\" with fevor. Anyone who understands this neurological condition will give credit to this man for his outstanding performance. As told in the story, \\"humans are not born knowing how to stanmer\\". I have treated quite a few who have suffered from this. And they do suffer. See the movie and believe what you hear. They deserve kudos for the research, training,and most of all a performance that provides truth for both those who suffer and families who do not understand. Never ever should ECT be an answer for this condition. It is a remarkable cast. This film, in my opinion is flawless. I often wonder if the audience realizes the crew ,even  to the person holding the equipment must be as talented as the cast. I hope you will see this story. Thank you Amazon for providing this DVD. It was worth the wait. P.J.Today
B003F3NDOO|5.0|This show got so many bad reviews because it started out all wrong, but now it's totally amazing! No, it's not about a divorcee hunting younger dudes - the overarching theme is so much more important than that: adult friendship. The writing is amazing (and only gets better in the second season) and the chemistry between cast members is unlike anything I've seen since Scrubs!     One major complaint: The \\"making of\\" feature on the DVD is pitiful, so I would HIGHLY suggest [[ASIN:B004VSZCWI Cougar Town: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center]]. This panel discussion DVD, featuring all the main characters plus creators/producers, is phenomenal! It was great to watch the producers make fun of themselves for naming the show so horribly, and the chemistry I mentioned above is continued on-stage. You can just tell these people love each other, and that makes the show a true gem.
B00000F214|5.0|Brilliant script/plot, brilliantly acted, with a popper of an ending. For me, this is Kevin Spacey's best performance among many great performances. The ending sequence is as beautifully executed as it is unexpected. (I'm a writer; most plots seem pretty obvious to me, but The Usual Suspects sucked me so completely into the story that I didn't even try to figure it out, I just enjoyed the ride.) Subsequent viewings are just as good as the first even though you know what happens, because the characters are so compelling and the story is so enthralling. I won't summarize the movie or give anything away because your first viewing should be untainted to get the full, powerful effect. In a Netflix world, only the very best movies are worth buying to view anytime in high definition. This is one of those movies.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|Having watched the original series and movie, this new rerelease is a godsend. It's common knowledge that the creator of the series essentially went crazy towards the end of the series and thus the imagery and story towards the end of the series got really wacky. So far, this newer version stays true to the essence of the original story but does it in a less extreme fashion, as well as introduces a new character, adding something new to long time followers of the series.     The animation is without a doubt some of, if not the most beautiful I have seen in an anime. The use of computer animation to enhance the film is done very seamlessly. This is truly a Blu Ray worthy animated film.
030746363X|5.0|In the first four weeks on the slow-crb diet, I lost 15 pounds and two inches off the waistline on my pants. I feel very healthy and energetic on this diet. Even better, I really love eating this way -- legumes give me the \\"comfort food\\" satisfaction that was missing from every other diet I've done. The binge day is nice because I don't feel like I'm missing out on anything for the rest of the week (if I'm craving something, I know I can have it in Saturday). Works for me and my wife.<br /><br />Personally, I also really like how this book is presented: as a bunch of tactics which you can employ (or not) for a variety of situations. For example, I personally have no interest in taking supplements (just goes against my gut feel on what's healthy). So I can simply skip those tactics and use the ones that DO fit both my goals and my comfort level for what I'm willing to experiment with.<br /><br />Should you be skeptical? Sure. Should you take every word as gospel? No. Does Tim advocate blind obedience to what he writes? Of course not. Everyone calm down and take this book for what it is: a well-written collection of tactics based on Tim's personal experiences. Use what's useful for you, skip what isn't.<br /><br />Personally, I've got my money's worth. I recommend 4HB without reservation.

B001QITO52|1.0|I bought the 1997 \\"re-master\\" and it sounds awful - very harsh and brittle and compressed. If these sound engineers don't know what they are doing, the buying public should not have to pay for their incompetence! If a re-mastered re-master of a re-master comes out, the original re-master should be recalled by the manufacturer as a defective product and replaced at no charge! The only way they are going to stop making these multiple re-masters is if it starts costing them money because money NOT MUSIC is the only thing they understand.
B002LVUKIS|5.0|Thief was so far ahead of its time that the gameplay aspect actually remains superior to most modern games.  The original graphics, though technically dated, retain a gritty medieval style that, in much the same way an impressionist painting does, evokes the creative mind to fill in the details with something more rich than realism alone could provide.  The storyline is portrayed though a variety of mediums such as cut-scenes and mission briefings, the most immersive of which is are the in-game writings the player stumbles upon - journals, ledgers, posted notices, love notes, etc.  Make no mistake, this is no run-and-gun or hack-and-slash action pack.  Rather, this is a thinking-person's deliberate full experience to be savored and not rushed, like an exquisite meal or a thought provoking book or conversation.  Spend a few bucks, order this game series, and prepare to enjoy a surprisingly fulfilling adventure of discovery and, ultimately, redemption.    (due to some technical difficulties, the first two games may need a little \\"coaxing\\" to run smoothly on the latest computers, but thousands of faithful Thief fans have managed it without much issue, and they are willing to lend a hand to any who need help.  The TTLG.com Thief forums are probably the best place to find answers or ask a question)    PS - There are also hundreds of \\"fan missions\\" available free.  These are finely crafted single-player \\"maps\\" you can download and play after finishing the main storyline.  In fact, there are a few fan created campaign sets, made by teams of ultra-dedicated super-fans over multiple years, that rival the full-length games themselves!  In effect, you're getting far more than three games with this deal.  Download missions at KeepofMetalandGold.com, ThiefMissions.com, and other repositories.
030746363X|4.0|There are a lot of diet books out there, but this book is totally different.  When Tim talks about truly \\"hacking the human body\\", he means it.  This book has helped me get more focused, more muscular, in better mental shape and just, well, better.  Not sure if I'll stay on the plan forever, but right now it feels pretty good to me.  It's not highly scientific, but can be if you like that kind of detail (and Tim provides it in spades for those that are interested).  It's a great companion volume to the  4 Hour Workweek, another of Tim's successful titles (although I've done better with the 4HB than 4HWW).    I highly recommend this to all those that are looking for the answer to fitness and health, but are tired of having to weigh, measure, calculate, etc. every time they sit down to eat a meal.
0307593495|2.0|As a huge fan of this series, I was deeply disappointed (and a bit baffled) by this last novel closing the series. This narrative does not sound like Mankell as we've come to know his writing. The plot is lame, uninteresting, and uninformed to boot, the narrative is repetitive, even awkward at times, with many logical inconsistencies and mistakes, the editing is haphazard and confusing; in short, the whole effort is an unlikely Mankell, unworthy to be considered a Wallander novel, let alone the very last one. The book reads like a hurried effort to finish Wallander off. The author's Afterword reads as if he might be aware of some of these problems. The fact that this book was very positively reviewed in places like the The New York Times adds to my bafflement with this whole enterprise. It is unfair to the longtime readers and the fans of the series for the professional critics to ignore the deficiencies of this book, and focus instead solely on the fact that this is a Farewell. Sentiment has its place, but this novel does not earn it.<br /><br />A few pages into the novel, it becomes immediately apparent where the story is going, which in turn makes the whole exercise of following Wallander trudge his way through the plot excruciatingly painful. Many people and cases from his past make, what feels like a forced or obligatory appearance, having nothing to do with the current plot or any recent connections with Wallender.<br /><br />Just a few examples of countless contradictions and lapses in logic that plague this book: A 74-year old ex Navy man visits Wallender, and he is wearing his US Navy uniform; on p.85 Wallander remembers noticing an object (a small stone) missing, on p. 121 he suspects and then \\"confirms\\" that the very same stone (from p. 85) is missing; on p.79 we are told his English is \\"so shaky that he didn't dare venture into complicated sentence structure,\\" then on p.83 we are told \\"..Wallender thought. I'm used to thinking that stories in English are so much richer or more important than stories I hear in my own language\\"; he learns that someone had seen him previously, but 2 pages later when that person sees and recognizes him at present, we are told he thinks maybe she saw him in a photograph (I doubt if this was deliberately planted by the author to show us Wallender's confused mind because Mankell does nothing that's subtle in this book). At one point, a conversation between two characters about the phase of the moon implies that the moon looks different depending on where one is located on Earth (i.e. if they are both located in Sweden, then the moon looks the same, otherwise not). Mankell needs to Google more or get a new Editor.  There are some characters, events, and various details introduced earlier on in the story, only to be abandoned, unexplained, or left unresolved by the end. To be fair, at the end of the book, Mankell produces a short discussion (Wallender thinks through a list) with some of these unresolved issues mentioned, and simply states that they remain unanswered. That is not good enough. Even the characterization of the symptoms of AD as experienced by Wallender, (there is only ONE symptom he is reportedly suffering from, over and over, experienced in the exact same format, and ONLY when he is alone) is uninformed, reduced to stereotypical babble.<br /><br />It is hard not to think whether it is Mankell himself who is really the \\"Troubled Man\\" after all, projecting his troubles, whatever they might be, onto Wallender in this seemingly hasty, ill-conceived and messily executed novel.<br /><br />It's been a wonderful, delightful, fantastic ride with Wallender, and this ending is definitely not worthy of what came before.

030746363X|4.0|I heard about Tim Ferriss and the book on the Nerdist podcast. I liked what he had to say, how he said it and his overall process to coming to all of the crazy things this man has done to himself. The book should be taken how it was presented. Here are all the crazy things that he has done, if you want to get some of the results he got without the craziness - follow these steps, be skeptical, consult a physician, explore on your own and enjoy the parts you are interested in. Even if you don't do anything he talks about in the book, it is a fascinating read about his process and conclusions he came to while seeking these things out. It is a fun read and I have been trying the Slow Carb Diet to much success. The other reviews seem to be extremes which is only appropriate since how he came to putting this book together was by going to extremes. I think the best way to decide if this book is for you is by listening to the Nerdist podcast or going on youtube and listening to him speak and answer questions when he was at Google. It's a good overview for the book and you get a taste of both his personality and the way the book is written.

0143038419|4.0|I LOVED this book. I will admit that it was really slow getting starting and getting into good parts. I mean, it seemed like it took months to get to the meat but when it did, I was not disappointed. There were so many lines and little tidbits of knowledge about self, spirituality and embracing life that I learned. I found myself highlighting certain lines throughout the book. The biggest lesson I learned took away at the end was to embrace life; even if it makes you or other uncomfortable. Sometimes we have to be uncomfortable to learn to appreciate comfortable. That goes for all aspects of your life. When I finally saw the movie, I felt the passion of the book. There were some scenes cut out of it due to the length but it was totally worth it. REad the book and then see the movie.
0345522478|5.0|What do you get when you mix in all of the world's mythologies, pantheons and superstitions with modern snark and rich pop culture influences? One of the best urban fantasy books I've read in... uhm... ever.<br /><br />Atticus O'Sullivan might look like a barely-legal-to-buy-booze college kid but thanks to his druid's knowledge of herb lore the guy's pushing into the millenia-old catagory. With his trusty Irish Wolfhound sidekick, Oberon, and a whole lot of running he's managed to stay out of the way of trouble for a while but his past is catching up with him. An angry Celtic god wants his sword back and might just be ready to stop sending in lackeys who aren't getting results. If only that were the half of it.<br /><br />With gods and goddesses from all over choosing sides and doing their best to muddle the whole thing up Atticus will need help from his friends and a hell of a lot of it. Angry witches, Viking werewolves and frisky old Irish ladies mix this plot into a laugh-out-loud adventure worthy of the highest praise.<br /><br />I love a butt kicking chick as much as any urban fantasy fan can but I loves me a guy character who can solidly stand-up with them on the shelves. Unfortunately they aren't so easy to find. If you've been looking for a great urban fantasy series with a male lead look no further. Atticus is a druid, old as dirt but blessed with a youthful face and a spirit that matches. Outwardly he might appear a little cowardly but he's crazy like a fox.<br /><br />The world building for this series is absolutely fierce. I've been wishing for an urban fantasy author to get bold enough to try setting a world up where the many pantheons of the past and present could blend effectively and work. Hearne has made this a world you'll find rich and well thought. A Viking vampire who as a beef with Thor? Sign me up!<br /><br />While Atticus and the world building are essential and delightful I couldn't help but be charmed by the vibrant secondary characters but specifically Oberon. I am not a dog lover, don't even like dogs because the whole dog loyalty and personality doesn't suit my own. Somehow Oberon just managed to wiggle his chatty little tail into my heart and make me almost wish I was a dog person. Providing that hilarious comic relief every well-written UF series needs he is likely to charm most readers the way other \\"sidekick\\" characters (ie. Jenks from Kim Harrison's Hollows series) have.<br /><br />Overall I honestly can't review this one well enough. There was nothing I didn't like about it. I've tried to think of anything to complain about and all I could come up with is that my husband found Oberon to be too chatty and distracting at parts... see I made him read it as soon as I finished it, I loved it that much. Ha! I'd recommend this for mythological urban fantasy fans, fans of Celtic lore and especially for dudes who are wishing for more male characters they can relate to in the genre. I am so thrilled Hexed and Hammered are being published so close to Hounded because I'm shaking with excitement to dive into this world again. So what are you doing still reading this review?

0743454537|4.0|I will not review the plot line of \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" since I believe it is very familiar and covered thoroughly in other reviews on this website.  What I will say is that this is one of a handful of Jodi Picoult books that I have read, and I believe this one is the most powerful.  Everything in this book feels genuine, from the competition between the siblings to the struggle between the parents to determine what is best for their children.  The emotions in this book run deep and raw, and I think it would be hard to make it through to the end with a dry eye.  Although I sometimes don't like how Picoult novels use \\"worst case\\" scenarios in storytelling, I felt like this novel was very effective in the way it used the illness of one girl to disect family issues, social issues, and moral issues of the country as a whole.  I found this book fascinating, and I think it has convinced me to try other Picoult works.
0143035711|5.0|I did not fight in Viet Nam and so I cannot comment on its accuracy or authenticity. I shall review this book purely from the perspective of a someone on the sidelines, a bystander who believes its contents to be both authentic and accurate.<br /><br />The first thing one notices with this text is the quality of the writing. A good number of books I have read on the Viet Nam War were written by people who were professional soldiers and not professional writers. Clearly Mason has a literary gift and 'Chickenhawk' reads more like a novel than a war memoir. Mason's prose, his characters and the plot (if you will) are all superbly recorded and accurately recalled - in fact some seem far too accurate for a man in combat to have remembered with such clarity.<br /><br />So what is Chickenhawk and why is it worth you spending your money on? Well to answer the first question, it is simply the memoir of an individual who trained then flew helicopters in the Viet Nam War. It is his recollection of the people and the events that took place from the time he arrived in-country until the time he rotated back. Is it worth you spending your hard-earned on? Will you get something from this book? Will you spirit be enlivened and your knowledge deepened? A resounding YES! to all the aforementioned. I would state that this is an excellent book, no matter how you read it or deconstruct it or from whichever perspective you regard it. It succeeds because it is a simple story of one man's journey to the centre of himself and back. In that regard it is very much like Copolla's Apocalypse Now, insofar as that story is really the intertwining of two narratives that of Colonel Kurtz and Captain Willard. Chickenhawk, like Apocalypse is really a personal journey that occurs through the time space and narrative of war, but it remains about the man, the author.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough. Everyone I have spoken to who has been fortunate enough to encounter this text agrees that in the pile of memoirs that were written after Viet Nam, this one is probably on the top of the pile. Anyone who is interested in either the topic of war in its broadest context, or the Viet Nam conflict will certainly enjoy this book. Read in conjunction and referenced against other texts on the War it will undoubtedly add another strand to the tapestry of information that needs to be woven about that pivotal moment in history.hat were written after Viet Nam, this one is probably on the top of the pile.

0743298039|5.0|Wow! This book was so good! I haven't been that engrossed in a book in a long time. I have read almost every spare moment since I started this one and couldn't wait to get to the end (and at the same time, was sad to see that it was over).<br /><br />It's is definitely more than a little creepy and, at times, disturbing and sad. It is a mystery, but also explores the relationship between twins, which I thought was very interesting. It has the feel of a ghost story, but not in the way that you'd suspect. Love, family and grief were also touched on in the novel. There is not a \\"happy ending,\\" but the main character does come to terms with certain issues by the story's end. It felt realistic and genuine, and anything less than that would have cheapened the story.<br /><br />I'm most impressed with the way that the author handled several different voices throughout the novel. Not only does she juggle the voices of the main character, Margaret, and Vida Winter, there is also an excerpt from someone's diary. All of the voices sounded unique to their character. I can only imagine how hard it is to change voices like that when writing.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this novel is the way it describes reading and stories, or rather the love of reading and stories and how a book (and thereby story) can hold you in it's grip until the end. She describes this love of story in a way that appears so simple, yet I've never thought of it in that manner before. If I didn't read it for any other reason than to see what it says about reading, I'd still be happy. Setterfield's prose, in general, was beautiful, and if this hadn't been a library book, I would have underlined so many passages (in pencil, of course).<br /><br />While it wasn't without it's flaws--sometimes the story was a bit overly dramatic (exclamation points sometimes give the affect of trying too hard, Margaret's obsession with twins and general melancholy outlook)--the good far overshadows any negative aspect, in my opinion.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.ecommended.

In this top-notch CD reissue, it emerges as a superb document of David at that crucial 74-75 \\"Must Break America\\" period. Here's what you get:<br /><br />Sound: a new stereo mix by Tony Visconti that certainly is fuller than the earlier Ryko CD. And don't forget that with the magic of programming, you can enjoy just about the entire Diamond Dogs album -- live!<br /><br />Package: a greatly expanded booklet, intelligent Visconti liner notes (what else?), and a cool fold-out with tour dates and truly rare photos from the 1980 Floor Show, including Bowie cupped in the fabled giant hand & playing guitar with Warren Peace in some post-Apocalypse NYC set.<br /><br />Bonus tracks: a treat indeed. The first disc offers the same track listing as its Ryko counterpart but the second incorporates both the Ryko extra tracks, the restored Space Oddity, and the brilliant live Panic in Detroit (rare B-side to Knock on Wood), now all resequenced into the actual performance. Absolutely fabulous.
0061689246|4.0|This book was a blast to read. Gaiman's version of Faerie was charming, and I feel that there is much more to it than the glimpse Stardust gives readers.<br /><br />Once I started reading, I was surprised that the copy that I read is marketed for teens--not that teens can't read and enjoy it, but it definitely seemed more appropriate for adults. There is some violence and sex (which I was absolutely not expecting). It wasn't terribly graphic, but it doesn't leave quite everything to the imagination--definitely what I would label adult.<br /><br />There is plenty of adventure here and a lot of humor. It is a lot darker and, well, more adult, than the movie makes the story out to be. I love the movie as well, but it is different--not for better or worse, just different.<br /><br />If I were to complain about anything, it would be the ending. I felt like there is a lot of build up of danger with the possible heirs to Stormhold looking for the star, along with the witch queen, but in the end, everything just sort of fizzles out and falls neatly into place. I also thougth that the romane between Tristan and the star could have been played up a little more. It's all so matter-of-fact, and I didn't quite understand why they loved each other, other than the \\"true love\\" idea, which can be a bit boring.<br /><br />These two things are why I didn't give it five starts. I was hoping for a big battle, final showdown, etc, but it didn't happen. Maybe that is one drawback of watching the movie first because I was waiting for that last battle.<br /><br />Still recommended for any fan of fantasy.
B00428ZRFY|5.0|Luv Rihanna. She's injects some caribbean spice into her tunes and you feel it in her riddims. A super buy.
B000X107GI|5.0|I don't know how I'm supposed to rate the battery life of these batteries when I just got them. I'm not using them for any photography application. I'm using these batteries to power my blood glucose meter. I bought 5 of them, because I'm a diabetic and it's a pain to get a dead battery in my meter. So far, so good.<br /><br />The batteries work, they were cheap, and they shipped promptly with a good arrival time. I recommend this seller, but can't really rate the product right away.
B00454U1NS|4.0|Luv this CD. Songs with lyrics that mean something set to wonderful music.   The best of her Greatest Hits. Pink is unique
030746363X|4.0|The book is well organized and good written, easy to understand even for non-mothertongue speakers. Apart the content in itself, what it is really appreciable is the \\"way\\" of thinking expressed in the book: applied pragmatism everywhere, direct to the point.

B0032CVAQQ|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book that already say it all. But I will say this: This ought to be required reading for everyone in the world. I honestly think there'd be fewer arguments and the world would be a happier place. This book doesn't just apply to couples -- this would be great for anyone with close friends or relatives, children, basically anyone to whom you show love. The scenarios in this book are truly universal and surprisingly hit home. I honestly believe that everyone who reads this book will come away with at least a little something learned -- for the better. Also, I read this on my Kindle, and the text, layout, etc. are wonderfully clear and well formatted.
B003AXS51A|5.0|This was, without a doubt, the best book I read all year! I would recomment The Art of Racing in the Rain to anyone and everyone. I read it and then I reread it. In fact, it's still on my night stand because I may pick it up and reread it again.    If you love dogs please, please read this book!!    No, I'm no relation to Garth Stein (author)!    Sincerely,   Marna Olson-Coulter  Cedar Rapids, Iowa
0553381687|5.0|So there's not much I can add to the conversation here that hasn't been said already. Game of Thrones is an excellent book that kicks off a great series of epic proportions. The characters are rich and (extremely) flawed. Each has his burdens to carry. Twists are in abundance, and NO character is safe. People die when you don't think they will, sometimes seemingly by accident.<br /><br />How much you will enjoy the book depends on your preference. Like many fantasy books, GoT can drag on and seem slow at some points. It is heavily descriptive with an abundance of characters, though having watched the show I am a bit thankful for my greater in-depth knowledge of the characters. On the other hand, the book is definitely not fantasy in the traditional sense.  Magic, sorcerers, etc. don't play a key role in the story. They exist mainly in history, and are tangential to the plot. This book is truly about power, and what people will do to acquire it.<br /><br />If you have the time to delve into this long novel (and then the rest of the series as you will no doubt be sucked in) then I definitely recommend giving it a go.
B003L77TZI|3.0|The first five tracks on this album are standard fare, a lot like [[ASIN:B0017ZB8M6 One of the Boys]]; upbeat, catchy, silly, colorful pop music with sexual connotations. But after that, the music shifts to a more serious, mature and dark place; songs like \\"Circle The Drain\\", \\"E.T.\\", \\"Who Am I Living For\\" being a lot more mellow and heavy-hitting. In my opinion, they're a pleasant surprise, proving that Perry can do more than radio-friendly sugary laced pop songs for pre-sexual teenagers giggling about penis metaphors. \\"Circle The Drain\\" is my favourite, it's like a sledgehammer of honesty about a former boyfriend with a heavy drug addiction, both the intro and outro are surprising, and the chorus is great. \\"E.T.\\" is also a great thumping club-track, sensual but with great powerful vocals, far removed from \\"I Kissed A Girl\\". \\"Pearl\\" is more of a power-ballad about the many disempowered and abused women of the world - not exactly the most original topic or special melody. \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" kind of merges the two; the chorus is upbeat but there's a little bit more of a pop-rock sound to it. Catchy chorus, but again, it's all sexual metaphors (will her next album be called \\"Arrival of the Stork\\"?). Finally wrapping it up is \\"Not Like The Movies\\", a ballad that proves that Katy Perry can actually sing when she puts her mind to it. A decent way to wrap up a very surprising album, that could've been fantastic if she dared to take the leap to a darker place, but that might disappoint the preteen/early teenage audience.
0385333846|5.0|I'll start off by saying that I've read all but 2 of Kurt Vonnegut's works. This was one of the first that I read and to this day it remains my favorite. As a matter of fact, it's probably one of my \\"all time top 3.\\" In \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" Vonnegut somehow manages to tell a story that is  simultaneously quasi-sci-fi, psychological, funny, and a deep study of human morals. It's a book that will have you laughing most of the time while you read it, then somber when you think back on it as a whole. It manages to get across the anti-war morals that Vonnegut feels, but NEVER gets preachy or heavy-handed.     I don't want to ruin any of plot (and you can see descriptions anyway) so I'm not going to bother to delve into it. I'll just say that this is a once-in-a-generation type of book and it's a quick read too, so you owe it to yourself to give it a shot
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is a different story that will keep you interested till the end.<br />Exceptional performance by Colin Firth and Helena Bonhan Carter.<br />It's the story of Queen Elizabeth's father that became king in a non-natural way and the struggle he had with public speaking.<br />Excellent film, lots of fun.<br />I recommend.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|Amazing movie. I cannot believe this movie is not more widely known and appreciated. It is a must see for any sci-fi action fan. James Caviezel and Sophia Myles were simply great in this as well as the rest of the cast. If you liked Reign of Fire you will like this.
B004132HZS|5.0|If you are a fan of any of the past Sherlocks, keep your seat belt tightened.... this one will take your a wild ride.  After seeing the first episode on Masterpiece Theatre I had to buy the DVD.  The 2nd and 3rd episodes continued filling out the characters of Holmes and Watson in the 21st century.  At first I didn't think this could work but the fast paced writing and the superb acting makes this series a \\"must see.\\"  Finally, someone is giving the viewer some credit for having a brain and the glimpses of humor are excellent.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Every so often, there's a new \\"Doctor\\". Same guy, new body. That's just how the universe works.  Not every fan will feel the same way about each respective 'Doctor'. Each actor has their own following, some more than others.    I was originally introduced to Doctor Who during Tom Baker's tenure. I remember watching it with my Dad on PBS.    I've watched this new series, and I must admit - I really like Christopher Eccleston as The Doctor.    Eccleston seemed to really enjoy playing The Doctor. I think he put more effort into this particular show  than any other work that I have seen him do. I may never know why he left the show - really doesn't matter.  I would have liked to have seen Christopher Eccleston go for at least a second season as The Doctor - 13 episodes just wasn't enough.    Another spark in this series was Billie Piper (as Rose Tyler). The Doctor is nothing without companion(s), and I think that  Piper and Eccleston had a chemistry that was simply magical. They seemed to really enjoy working with each other.    So, Baker vs. Eccleston  Baker's got more tenure, and for me, will always be the 'original' Doctor.  Enjoyment Factor - tough call. I'm going for TIE.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|I took extremely good care of these headphones and they still broke. I'm 39 and use them for PS3 maybe once a week. Other than that they are stored in a cabinet. First one side broke. Then a month or two later the other side broke. Now both sides are taped up extensively with black electrical tape to hold them together. I wouldn't buy these again and would not recommend them to anyone. Also, the cord gets all tangled up every time I used them.
030746363X|5.0|Okay,     First, let's talk about reviews. If you read 3 negative or 3 positive reviews about one book, movie, car, whatever and base your decision to move forward on that without taking into account the rest of the reviewers then you'll probably get what you want based on what you perceive. If you tend to favor positive reviews on things you'll probably trend positively; same goes for negative reviews. EVERYONE has an opinion. Often, those opinions are incredibly, emotionally powerful--one way or the other.     I'm giving Tim's book full stars. The reasons are simple... The author is crystal clear about asking us, his readers, to experiment, to try for a short period of time his method and to track the changes. Face it, we're all where we are because of steps we made yesterday.     I'm 47 years old and while not in terrible shape neither can I say that I'm in good shape. Clothes hide the effects of the steps I made daily to get... here. So I started reading and was instructed by this author to focus on 4 chapters: Fundamentals, Ground Zero, The Slow-Carb Diet I and II, and Building the Perfect Posterior. Those chapters focus on effective weight loss. Sure I read the rest of the book, four times through now, and can see how some have gotten confused by what might appear conflicting information.     But again, he breaks out what to read for what you're looking for: Fat loss, muscle gain, strength gain, or sense of total well-being. Most of us would think, \\"Well, I want all that!\\" So, we dive in and try to do it all.     Stop!    Re-read his Five Rules in using the book:    1. Think of this book as a buffet.  2. Skip the Science if it's too dense.  3. Please be skeptical.  4. Don't use skepticism as an excuse for inaction.  5. Enjoy it.    For me, my first priority is getting rid of fat. Then I'll look at muscle gain, then strength gain, then well-being. How's it worked so far? Actually, extremely well! I started at 200 pounds with a target of 170. My focus has been only on those four \\"Fat Loss\\" chapters. I started 3 weeks ago and am at 185. I've had some ups and downs with the eating plan and can clearly see why. I'll share more on that shortly.    In addition to reading the book several times through I've also spent a lot of time on his blog. Please, please remember folks... This author is asking us to step out of what we've been doing in the past and try something different. On the surface that sounds easy. But it isn't. Most of the posts I've read basically ask \\"permission\\" to step out of the guidelines he's asking of us: Can I have bread if it's healthy? Can I have juice if it's organic? Can I, can I, can I?     Sure you can! But then what you're doing is the same you've done yesterday, and the day before, etc. And I've done it too. Better yet, it's okay. But it won't result in change. Most of us pick up a book like this because we want change. We would like to look a little better, feel a little better, and have the ability to do more with our families and friends. Great reasons for change! But remember, CHANGE IS HARD. Remember that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again while expecting different results. We all do it, but that doesn't mean we can't do things differently.    Tim has made this process easy for us. How about for 2 months, just 8 weeks trying this: (Note: he's asking just 1 month. I'm asking to try for 2.)    Avoid \\"white\\" carbohydrates  Eat the same few meals over and over again  Don't drink calories  Don't eat fruit  Take one day off per week    That's it! But... the hard part: Our brain is already gearing up to bargain with us... \\"But I can't start my day without my healthy cereal.\\" \\"I get bored with the same meals.\\" \\"But I have to have my Coke Zero.\\" \\"My doctor says that fruit is healthy.\\" (Note, most of us don't gripe about the taking one day off part.)    This author has shared through example and humor how HE has created change in his life. (You might also likehis, \\"Four Hour Work Week.\\") But he's also been clear that it takes work, focus, and the importance of measuring and managing as we go.    For me, yeah this has been hard. I messed up on my \\"cheat day\\" and didn't follow his suggestions on how to best (and easily) care for myself on that day. I was surprised that I gained back more than I lost. BUT, I began again and quickly reversed that trend. Walk through the few chapters he offers you to focus on what you are most trying to do. Don't make it hard.     My g/f is walking through this with me and it took her a while before she started seeing results. It really helped to read that is VERY normal for a woman over 40 who's had children to see quick change right off the bat. Don't give up. Keep trying. She is also seeing movement in the direction she's hoping for.    Take measurements. Take photos. If you see you're not losing weight go back and see if you've lost inches or body fat. If not, DO NOT stop. It's too easy to stop, we've all been doing that all our lives. Trying one thing for a short amount of time and then sliding back into our comfortable habits. Instead of trying how about doing?     Yoda reminds us that there is no \\"Try,\\" there is only \\"Do.\\" Do these steps. Live them for a while. Put them on and see how they fit. Yes they are different than what you've been doing. Yes it will be tough. But each moment of each day you will be doing the steps of your life.     I know this review has been long. But I also feel that this is very, very important. It's important for me to quit feeling run down, out of energy in the afternoon, having crappy sleep, etc. It's important for me to feel good in my body, that my partner finds me attractive, more importantly that I find me attractive. I LOVE being 47 and can't wait for my 50s! But I want that decade to be different than this one.     These steps really do work. This is a great book and I'm grateful for the time Tim put into it. There will ALWAYS be negative commentsabout anything you might be interested in. This isn't a fad, it's not a scheme, and it's not a quick fix.     I am not connected to Tim in anyway other than being an interested, thankful reader. Take my comments as just that, my comments. All the best to you and yours in this Journey!    Zane    Remember too: If you want tomorrow to be different than today, then you must take different steps today than you did yesterday. It really is as easy as that.
B00000DWHG|5.0|From before John got his hands on it. The 1996 remaster has a number of subtle changes (not subtle is the excellent extended instrumental part at the end of \\"Trick of the Light\\") anyone familiar with the original will surely notice.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|The music is classic. The acting & singing, the best. And the plot is engaging. It helps if you were alive & aware in the late '60's, but it's a treat for anyone. Watch it with a friend.

Not worth the money...even though I downloaded this on a free day.

B0031RS7X6|5.0|Another fabulous book from Kinsella which doesnt disappoint. I read this in an hour and loved it. Its funnny, insightful and satisfying. There are so many things in this book which I think many people can identify with - the whole issue of how much honesty is too much. Secrets that we keep from others and ourselves. Families and parents that seem to be forever disappointed in us and compare us to our siblings.     Highly recommended.
0385736002|5.0|This is a great series for youngsters and adults alike! It has historical figures, some awesome fight scenes and is a well-written and researched work while still being an easy but fun read. Also this was my first ever Amazon purchase. At first I was a little nervous because I don't really shop online. Let me say though that Amazon made it a totally painless experience. Michael Scott has won a fan for life and Amazon has a customer for life.
160059672X|4.0|I liked the book in general, but I was expecting more. I was hoping for more bracelets and designs. I think a basic variety of patterns and designs would have added a special touch. Being new to making a cuff bracelet,in my mind I would have liked to see more of a lay out as to how to fill in the designs around the cabochons.<br />Like drawings of how best to surround the different shapes of cabochons, especially when your using more than one, perhaps 2 small and 1 large. I've researched to see the different variety of cuffs, plus there are cuffs made out of material that has designs in them, for example a pasiley print could be used to bead over it. Which I bought a pattern, but not sure if I really like it.<br /><br />I would have like more ideas on how to use colors with cabochons that have several colors in the stone, like I've seen in Bead & Button and Beadwork magazine.  I found the book \\"Beading with Cabochons\\" by Jamie Cloud Eakin  went the extra mile with details in various layouts. This book covered pendants not bracelets but the structure is the same.<br /><br />I also notice some bracelets are backed with Lacey's sticky stuff then followed with suede material without using a metal cuff bracelet. The instructions<br />I found from various artist chose to use Lacey's sticky stuff for the length of the bracelet. Some say to use cardboard. Now that really became distrubing to me.<br /><br />The mention of how to apply the glue to the material around the edges made me wonder if the needle would be able to go through the dry glue as well as the material . Sewing around the edges was another thing that I wasn't sure about, how close as I've read in the magazines made me wonder, how well will the finish product (bracelet) look without the metal cuff.<br /><br />In Sherry Serafini's book lot of pages were used to show you eleborate necklaces which I felt wasn't so important since you don't see any body wearing them. Although I did notice around the holidays the jewerly business brought out some necklaces, using a smaller scale of embroidery with big stones with ribbons that tie in the back.<br /><br />Cutting the fabic to match the fancy graphic metal cuffs  would seem difficult if its not the right size, not only that, but one web site who sells the cuffs mention that they had laid out the metal so that they could trace it, and they own their own company therefore they could afford to do that!<br /><br />I felt that there could have been more information like one of the other reviewers mention, where to purchase the metal cuffs and the cabochons. If it wasn't for the \\"Bead Shows\\" that came to New York I wouldn't have found cabochons. And in NY their are plenty bead stores around but unless you have a license to shop in a wholesale bead store you cannot get cabochons.<br /><br />The cover was very inspirational. I just wanted more ideas and instrucions and designs.ewerly business brought out some necklaces, using a smaller scale of embroidery with big stones with ribbons that tie in the back.<br /><br />Cutting the fabic to match the fancy graphic metal cuffs  would seem difficult if its not the right size, not only that, but one web site who sells the cuffs mention that they had laid out the metal so that they could trace it, and they own their own company therefore they could afford to do that!<br /><br />I felt that there could have been more information like one of the other reviewers mention, where to purchase the metal cuffs and the cabochons.

B004O05NNQ|5.0|I had heard Little Lion Man and The Cave on the radio a couple of times and I decided to spring for this special edition. I have to say I was a little surprised about what I heard coming from the rest of this album. While Little Lion man, The Cave, and Dust Bowl Dance lean towards rock with a folksy twist, the rest of the album tends to lean more in the Folk genre. So if all you're familiar with is Little Lion Man and the Cave and you really don't want to listen to Folksy music, walk err.. mouse away now... but be warned you'll be missing out on a great album.    I don't listen to Folk music usually. I don't dislike the genre, I'm just not familiar with it or it's artists. With that said, I'm very happy I bought this album. It is full of heart, soul, and emotion. The opening song \\"Sigh No More\\" just really blew me away when I first played it. For one I wasn't expecting the folksy music and I definitely wasn't expecting the warmth and humanity coming through my headphones. Overall, the whole album is just fantastic, a very talented group.    Now moving on to the main reason for buying the special edition, the live CD. My personal favorite live album is DC Talk's \\"The Freak Show\\". The live version of those song recordings are actually better than the studio versions because of the energy. It is my measuring stick for live albums. In this case, the live version of Sigh No More is as good as the studio, but not better. That's not a slight to the band though because as I previously said, the studio album is fantastic from start to finish. This band plays amazingly well live and the vocals are just incredible. In an age where artists can put out good sounding cds and move on to put poor live vocal performances, Mumford & Sons stand out. They are that rare group that could live on as musicians in any age because they don't need fancy electronic equipment to sound good.    Now to the packaging. At first glance I was super impressed with the packaging. Instead of cheap plastic and cardboard you're greeted with a beautiful green canvas like cloth material with a silhouette of the band embroidered in gold. Then you open the packaging and you have a very nice booklet inside. This is the type of creativity in packaging that we are missing in today's CDs. If the music industry wants to keep selling CD's instead of having people download illegally or off of iTunes, this is what they need to do. When you hold this album in your hands you feel like you just bought something special. It makes collecting CD's just for the packaging worth it, although I stick to CD's for music quality, packaging like this is just more incentive.    Wait... you said one star for the packing, right? Yeah I did. You get three discs with this. The main album, the live cd, and the dvd. The live cd and the dvd come inside thick paper pockets that are attached to the back and front covers of the case. The problem with this is that the discs go in SUPER tight. It's so tight that there is no way to pull the discs out without scratching them. My live album came out with a bunch of scratches on it. I put it back and then decided I'm not going to keep it inside the original case. I instead now keep the live album in a separate plastic case, the dvd I'm not personally concerned with. The main album is okay though. It hangs inside a thick paper sleeve next to the booklet. Since this isn't attached to the covers you can squeeze this paper sleeve on the side and you can then pull the album out very easily without scratching it. The scratches on the live album are light (although there are many) and EAC shows that the disc can be read without any errors but as someone who likes to keep things in pristine condition, it still bugs me. No matter how beautiful the packaging is, if it can't store and protect the goods then you've ultimately failed.    On a bit of a side rant (if someone from the music industry is reading this), I've been noticing that the quality of discs have been ina decline over the last few years. It use to be that I would buy a cd, turn it over, and it was almost always in pristine condition. Now I often see streaks and small cosmetic deficiencies. If you want me to stop buying CD's and move on to iTunes, then you're doing a good job of pushing me in that direction. Maybe the studio's are cutting back on quality control because they want to compete with the iTunes pricing model. The last people buying and supporting the physical music formats are going to be the ones who care most about quality and having a physical collection. If people like me are to stick around with CD's then the quality of the discs and packaging need to be raised, not decreased.

030746363X|5.0|I am in the Navy, and up to this point have worked out regularly. I was in decent shape, but weight had crept on over the years. When I got this book, the second week of January, I changed nothing, with the exception of starting the slow carb diet. To date I have lost 20 pounds. The slow carb diet is the only part of this book that I have used, and I can say that it definitely jump started my metabolism. My weight and size is at a 10 year low! i recommend this to all my friends. Those friends that actually follow what he says have lost weight. Those that sort of follow it have lost little. In years past, I did atkins, until my cholesterol went through the roof. I spent the same amount of time doing Weight Watchers, with about half the result. 4HB bestworked for me....Just had my cholesterol checked and it dropped from pre-diet levels by 30, and I have eggs for breakfast everyday now.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|I never followed the series and only became a fan just a few months ago when I purchased Season One. I was VERY impressed with the story line, the characters and the care to detail in set designs, costumes and language for the period. An eye-opener to how business was conducted on Madison Ave (and other businesses) with the free-flowing booze and cigarettes!     Season One and the rest of the series is a must-have for anyone's DVD collection!

B004JN1D2I|3.0|I am a big fan of the series (delay between books not withstanding), but I have a hard time paying double for the Kindle version versus the paperbacks.  I travel quite a bit, but I can't quite get to the point where I'm willing to pay double for the convenience of having all four books on the Kindle.  Random House needs not to try to gouge their customers - especially so transparently.
030746363X|5.0|I read the whole book in 3 days. I just couldn't stop reading. I applied several concepts from the book including the slow carb diet (lost 7kg in less 2 months) and concepts from the chapter adding muscle (gained 4kg of muscle in 3weeks).  It's a nice book with good writing style and nice pictures for not a lot of money.

030746363X|5.0|I can't write enough superlatives about the content of the book. To make a long story short, I've lost 60 pounds in 4 months. Read the book literally, then make sure you get the spirit as well.    The book is about self experimentation, try these ideas out on yourself, see how it works, and then make adjustments.    I highly recommend it to anyone interested in weight loss, a new lifestyle, that includes a food plan.........this is the book for you. Go for it!,,,
0307463745|2.0|I wanted to like Rework by Fried and Hannson, but I feel like I overpaid.    To say it's a short book is an understatement. This is pretty much it:    Simplicity is the only winning formula.  Don't hire until quality falls.  A successful private company can get by with very few employees by outsourcing utility functions (details on this may be in their other book)  Meetings are bad, but distributed teams need to get together every three months or so. Evidently whatever those teams do together is not \\"meeting\\". Whatever \\"meeting\\" is.  True productivity works with a balanced 45-50 hour week -- but when you're doing a startup you should sacrifice sleep and keep your day job.  You can make money by reselling the detritus of corporate activity, like this book.  Cash flow is king, be positive early.  Build enough to sell, then build what you need to keep selling.  Customers can't tell you what they need.  Don't fear customers graduating from your services (but I wager they don't make it easy for customers to migrate their data).  Don't surrender ownership early -- wait until you're a proven company.  Only hire talented writers - regardless of the position  The book isn't worthless. About two thirds of it feels right, which is better than the average business book. On the other hand, I don't buy average business books.    I'd recommend a pass on this one. Do pick it up at the library or a used book store. $8 would be a fair price.    (Review copied from my Gordon's Notes blog.)

0757302661|2.0|Supporters of this book will all insist that it should be used in conjunction with a course, and this is true, because you can't do hypnotherapy from a page. However, it should also be pointed out that hypnobirth courses are seriously expensive. This is a business as much as a book. Hypnobirthing is a brand, and other brands offer you very similar methods for much less money.    As to the book itself - well, be a little wary. Some of it is basic common sense: the more fearful you are, the more intensely you will experience pain. Breathing and visualization can relax you. This is all perfectly true and reasonable.    Some of it is rather affected by the idea of other cultures being 'Noble Savages' - it doesn't use that phrase, but it's very starry-eyed about how other cultures don't use pain relief as if that's always good for the woman, which is just not the case: some women in cultures without medical pain relief have a terrible time. It's also rather judgmental about using pain relief, which is not good news if your birth turns out to be difficult, because generally speaking women who used pain relief are women who found the pain unbearable and will be feeling emotionally fragile as it is.    An important fact can be seen in the opening chapters: the author found that with relaxation, she was able to bear her own children with little pain and distress. Okay, so that speaks to the value of her method, but it also speaks to the fact that she found childbirth comparatively easy: she didn't have to deal with a labor that went on for days, or had the baby in the wrong position, find her labor stalled, or generally speaking had problems that would make things more painful. Reading the book, I got the feeling that she didn't quite grasp that this was not everyone's experience - or possibly that she blamed all labor complications on doctors or bad attitudes and forgot that before medical technology was advanced, death in childbirth was very common, good attitude or not.She also talks of how in her first two births, doctors intervened at the last minute and imposed on her pain relief that she didn't want or need. This is very bad, but again, I got the feeling that she didn't quite grasp that pain relief isn't an intrusion forced on every woman by doctors who don't understand her. Forcing pain relief on a woman who doesn't want it is cruel, but so is denying pain relief to a woman who needs it, and this book edges towards that cruelty by implying that pain relief is a sign of being brainwashed by doctors. There's a hostility to medicine here that is not in the interests of the many women who will find that medical intervention is something they turn out to need after all.    If it works for you, you'll feel extremely excited about it and praise it to the skies. But it isn't going to work for everyone, the courses are excessively expensive, the author's understanding of other cultures is at times sentimental and patronizing, and if it doesn't work for you you'll probably end up feeling worse for having read a book that so explicitly links the pain of childbirth with a bad attitude - it'll make it easier to believe that your suffering was your own fault.    In general, it's a book that's going to get either loved or hated, depending on the birth experience, so shop around for cheaper options and bear in mind that the praising voices are only one side of the story, is my advice.

B004OFWLO0|5.0|I already had the 1990 release \\"The Complete Recordings\\" so you would probably say , why buy this one , right ? Well I firgured it would be re-remastered using todays technology and I saw it had unreleased 2 snippets on disc 2 . I was gonna purchase it thru Amazon like I do most of the time but I wanted to see the packaging first to see if it was remastered . Well I purchased it today at a local independent record store (there are so few left these days)and I gotta say ,the sound is much improved over the 1990 boxset . The booklet is very nice and informative and the 2 new snippets (even though they are only seconds in length)are historical seconds in the story of the Blues . Maybe you have to be a Delta Blues fanatic like me to appreciate these few seconds . All in all this is a great 2cd set with great sound . The only thing missing from this as compared to the 1990 boxset is the lyrics . BUY IT ! ! !
B000AXSN5G|5.0|I was feeling a little out of the loop the other day while listening to the tune \\"No Wonder\\" from this record.  I mean, I dunno what Chris Rock said about much of anything, except maybe tossed salad.  And what does any of  that have to do with Willie Nelson?  Well, thank le bon dieu for Google, a quick search brings up a reference to a post 9/11 concert Neil played at, in which he was surrounded by candles while performing John Lennon's \\"Imagine.\\"  And Chris made a joke about it, but then is \\"Don't send no more candles, no matter what you do\\" really all THAT memorable.    Apparently, it was for Neil, and that's the kind of stream-of-consciousness moment I always liked in Neil Young tunes.  The Amazon writer above uses the word \\"elliptical\\" in reference to this song, and that just about says it all.  Neil Young is NOT all that linear, even when he starts out to be.  Dylan can go from obscurantism to story teller mode in the bat of an ice blue eye.  Neil Young has never struck me as a master of narrative, really: still, you always kinda know what he's talking about and it's usually pretty darn intriguing.    Of course, the other mot juste that our Amazon critic (Mr. McLeese by name) uses in relation to PRAIRIE WIND is \\"autumnal.\\"  (I could just kill the guy for stealing my potential thunder).  Neil is a master of melancholy, and we've known that much for decades, but still it takes a special kind of autumnal gloom to pen a line like \\"If you follow every dream/You might get lost.\\"  Wow, clearly NOT the writing of a young man.  This from a restless spirit, who in his lifetime seems to have followed many of his dreams, artistic and otherwise, and now...well, I guess you can say he's thinking better of it.    There's some heartbreak to that line, and to the song (\\"The Painter\\")in which it appears.  But it's more resigned than utterly devastated.  The painter still paints, the old guitar still plays, and the prairie wind blows through your head.  Elvis is dead, and it's SAD but also absurd, kinda.  Somber meditations, off the wall humor, apparent non-sequiturs about Willie and Chris--somehow they all add up to the meditations of an aging rocker who's not viewing the world with cynicism, exactly, but is more reflective and accepting than the angry young man who penned \\"Chicago\\" or \\"Tonight's The Night.\\"    And while I don't know anything about Mr. Young's spiritual beliefs, the closer is a genuine, heartfelt prayer no matter who you are or what you believe.  In its brief four verses, \\"When God Made Me\\" expresses sentiments and poses questions that all reflective humans have articulated or wondered about God and man's relationship to Him.  His ruminations are simultaneously childlike and quite sophisticated (\\"Did he make just me in his image/or every living thing?\\"--beautiful).  And some of his speculations remind me of all night bull sessions in college dorms, but then again, did we ever pose better questions? Or did we just stop asking?    Or maybe we start asking again when things start getting...autumnal.

B004WE01YA|3.0|I will not be buying this simply because I already have the original release, which suits me fine.    The only 2D animated 3D film I'm purchasing is in The Lion King Trilogy Boxset, and even then that's not the reason I'm purchasing it (the original is a classic film and the second one in my favourite, and I haven't seen the 3rd one [named 1 1/2 in the US]).    I don't quite understand it to be honest, I love 3D (despite my shallow pockets holding very little money) but any 3D release I make sure to get, if I enjoyed it in the cinema or know it'll be my kind of film (like I enjoy the Saw films and didn't see the last one in cinemas, but I will still, at somepoint, buy the 3D Blu-Ray).    I would like 3D to become a mainstay of cinema, however it is a gimmick and needs to be used well and to great effect, not to slap an extra few bucks onto the price tag.    If the other discs are exactly the same as the previous release then you may as well get this because it is a top-notch release, but if you already have the original Diamond Edition don't bother with this unless you're set up with 3D and don't mind to double-dip for a 2D animated movie, which I'm sure makes up about 0.000005% of the entire globe's population. Buy [[ASIN:B003DZX44I Beauty and the Beast (Three-Disc Diamond Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]] instead, it's a fantastic transfer, extras, the whole shebang, but this is blatant double-dipping gone haywire.

0345444051|5.0|\\"Childhood's End\\" by Arthur C. Clarke is one of those unforgettable novels. Nearly sixty years after it was written, the novel remains on student reading lists and sits among the classics, not only of science fiction, but also provocative literature.<br /><br />For what is better than a novel which demands thought and a resulting discussion? While reading is a solitary experience, discussing novels creates a communal experience. \\"Childhood's End\\" provides great shared experiences.<br /><br />That's just it: \\"Childhood's End\\" is more than science fiction--it is also apocalyptic, but most importantly, and, appropos to this discussion, it is a novel of ideas. The irony is how many of Clarke's ideas, or at least some form of his ideas, have come to fruition.<br /><br />Case in point: the hit television series \\"V\\" features two: the Overlords and a hidden agenda. In \\"Childhood's End\\" Clarke focuses on one family: a mother and a father and two young children, who come to represent the uninitiated, the pure or nearly pure of mind (depending on age), the modeling clay, metaphorically speaking. For gradually, each child learns new skills which develop into powers.<br /><br />In \\"V\\" the aliens have come for dark purposes; in \\"Childhood's End\\" for birthing purposes. Each time I taught this novel at the high school level, I always felt so sad at the end, when the children merged to become something else. It is this something else that I am here to review.<br /><br />Note: Spoilers ahead!<br /><br />In the last couple of years there has been much talk, much speculation, much re-examination of history and the Bible. Many believe the earth as we know it will end in 2012, according to the Mayan calendar system. Many talk of wars and rumors of wars, natural disasters, the world in chaos, signifying that the Rapture is near and Christians will be taken up to Heaven, leaving nonbelievers on Earth to face what will come. There are second chances.<br /><br />Clarke proposed some 60 years ago a scenario of the end. The physical world was the Earth with people still in chaos. The Overlords bring peace and prosperity. What they don't know is that this peace allows for the development of ESP and other paranormal activities of the children to heighten, then develop. There are hints of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" with the movement of the children to a central location to become. Finally, their minds cocoon and when they leave their bodies, they join the Overmind \\"out there.\\" Their leaving the Earth pulls out all energy and the Earth--pow! is obliterated.<br /><br />Although Clarke is proposing something much grander than death and destruction, or even deconstruction--a figurative and possibly a literal joining with the Overmind as a wonderful thing. The movie version even shows a giant fetus, almost fully developed, floating in space, as if in preparation for the next phase of existence.<br /><br />Although Clarke eschewed religion, allowing only possibly for a mild form of Buddhism, his final image of a pure mind about to join a super mind does have biblical overtones.<br /><br />Reading and discussing with others ideas contained in a work of literature is a very communal experience. It brings people together for a sharing and exchange of ideas. It opens minds to new possibilities, or in a contrary manner tears us further apart. Amazon provides a forum for such exchange and sharing.<br /><br />I offer this review as a gift--my mind to yours and whatever may happen afterward.Earth with people still in chaos.

B003UESJHO|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />With so many fight flicks out there, it helps to be a little bit different. The film's creator, Mark Wahlberg, wisely explores Prizefighter Micky Ward's family conflicts for three quarters of the film, rather than dwelling mainly on the conflicts in the ring. Wahlberg was attracted to Ward's story since they both grew up in large families, in a working class Massachusetts environment. For those who have no interest in astrology, I apologize, but I would like to point out that the natural inquisitive nature of a Gemini (Wahlberg), goes quite well with the laid back, easygoing Libran (Ward). What we end up with 'The Fighter' is an 'airy' concoction--a film that manages to exude a 'feel good' sensibility coupled with the strong dialectic between two brothers, whose mutual attraction and repulsion is constantly shifting.<br /><br />Since 'The Fighter' is based on the true story of Ward's rise to the top as a champion welterweight, whenever reality weasels its way into the narrative, the film is quite absorbing. The entire scene where Ward, goaded by his mother, agrees to fight an opponent twenty pounds heavier than he is, and then gets his ass kicked, is something I've never seen before in a boxing film. Ward's brother, Dicky (played by a chameleon-like Christian Bale), also provides a great deal of 'color' to an otherwise traditional tale of pugilistic ambition. Who can forget when Micky ignores his trainer's game plan and adopts his brother's strategy to win the title fight? This despite Dicky's continual descent into the hellhole of crack addiction.<br /><br />The bulk of 'The Fighter', however, is much more a tale of filial obligation (or should I say obsession?) than the history of Micky Ward's ascent to the welterweight crown. Why does it take Micky so long to realize that Dicky is actually holding him back? The answer in a nutshell is misguided filial obligation. A deeper subtext is that the Ward brothers are both in an unconscious incestuous relationship with their mother (played by an over the top Melissa Leo). While Micky eventually breaks free, Dicky takes a more circuitous route toward redemption. He must first go to prison where he finally overcomes his crack addiction and eventually allows his brother to fight without any conditions (that is, with Dicky no longer acting as if his brother owed him something).<br /><br />I would urge anyone who has seen 'The Fighter', to also see Visconti's \\"Rocco and his Brothers\\"--both films deal with two brothers who are prizefighters. In 'Rocco', the stakes are much higher: the successful prizefighter brother also has a misguided filial obligation to his now washed up sibling. Unlike Dicky (who eventually gives up his unhealthy family relationships), Rocco covers for his brother who has committed both rape and murder. Unlike the Visconti classic, Wahlberg is content to offer up a happy ending, where Dicky is welcomed into Micky's new boxing family, accepted by them despite all the past recriminations.<br /><br />The three principals here all acquit themselves well. The most impressive aspect of Wahlberg's performance is his physical conditioning; he trained for four years to get himself into shape to play this role. Even better is Christian Bale as Dicky. Bale lost approximately sixty pounds to play Micky's crack-addicted brother; when you first see him, you won't even realize it's Christian Bale. Amy Adams finally breaks out of her 'good girl' roles and plays a sexy, working class gal who helps Micky break his ties with his mother.<br /><br />Less successful is Melissa Leo as Alice Ward, the mother of the seven daughters. Yes, we get the idea that she's a control freak, but does all that 'control freak' stuff have to repeat itself ad infinitum? The daughters (described by many critics as a virtual \\"Greek Chorus\\"), provide additional cartoonish machinations; the stale comic relief reaches its apotheosis in the scene where the daughters try and pummel Micky's girlfriend, Charlene.<br /><br />Micky Ward's victory during the Championship Fight in London seems a bit anti-climactic. Wahlberg went to great lengths to reproduce the actual fight as it appeared on HBO in 2000. The actual recording of the HBO announcers was utilized during the film and the fight sequences were choreographed to match the actual movements of the boxers. It just seems kind of lazy to pad the end of your film with the reproduction of an actual event, which you could probably better enjoy by watching the real thing.<br /><br />'The Fighter' probably would have worked better had it been cut down by about 20 to 30 minutes. A good number of the scenes feel as if they're improvised and sometimes drag a bit. Nonetheless, the holy trinity of Wahlberg, Bale and Adams, make this fairly traditional boxing yarn, entertaining. Wahlberg stays true to his Gemini sign--there is something for everybody here: whether it be over the top acting performances, intense family conflict with incestuous undertones and gritty recreations of fighters plying their trade in the ring.ene.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was an amazing film when I went to see it in the theater, and I wondered what could be done to bring that feeling home.<br /><br />The answer was to keep the fill-frame IMAX scenes intact for the blu-ray! These scenes add to the tension and buildup of the plot, and make the action scenes easier to digest.<br /><br />Quality was superb, one of the best blu-rays that I own.<br /><br />Big fan of the film, was glad to nab this when it first came out!
B004US4K2C|5.0|This launcher is so much better than the standard Droid launcher.  It is fast and has many features to allow you customize your phone.<br /><br />If your old launcher has slowed down, I would highly recommend this one.
0375826726|4.0|I got this after it first came out, and can't wait for part 4. Paolini is a fantastic writer, and I cannot believe that he started this series when he was in his teens!
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|This is one albums that must be heard at LEAST 10 or so times until you really comprehend what is going on. J dilla put, in my opinion, the most work into this album in terms of songs flowing into eachother, the message, and pretty much everything. That being said, this was the first Dilla album I heard and if you are unfamiliar with his music this is a good one to start with. Dilla is one of my favorite artists and I seriously wish there were more of his instrumentals out there. \\"Don't Cry\\" is outstanding, as well as \\"Intro\\", \\"two can win\\", \\"Gobstopper\\", but dont be flipping tracks though, you gotta hear this one all the way through. RIP Dilla, you had a huge impact on hip hop.
B00284BNKC|4.0|I'm a sucker for a movie with shock value, so anything in the same vein as Requiem is on my 'watch' list. Glad to have this one at home to pull out whenever there is a guest that I want to get rid of.
B004K4IZ54|4.0|El lenguaje del BLU RAY es en ESpAÑOL SUDAMERICANO y NO EN CASTELLANO.  EL CODIGO DE LA COPIA DIGITAL NO VALE EN EL itunes europeo, y el DVD es para la región 1.  Por lo que no lo recomiendo comprar para Europa.  La caja es alucinante, preciosa.
0345529057|5.0|These books were a great price, and still brand new!  Even after shipping they were still under $25, and i got them mere days after I ordered them.  The story is amazing, and I am eagerly awaiting the final entry in July.  A must have for fans of fantasy, medieval history, or political intrigue.
B00275EHJG|5.0|When I was little I watched the first Toy story all the time, but even as an adult I still really love it. I wouldn't call Toy Story one of my favorite animated movies/series ever though, but I always appreciated how Disney managed to make a movie centered on children toys compelling in story and plot and how they made the characters come to life. When Toy Story 3 came out I must confess I wasn't too enthusiastic about it. I was expecting something that was a little better than the second, but not as good as the first. I was EXTREMELY surprised. This is definitely the best in the entire series!     In this one Andy is all grown up and is on his way to college. He plans on sticking his old toys (Woody) include up in the attic, but after a mix up the end up at Sunnyside Daycare. All the toys excluding Woody are hurt and believe Andy doesn't want them anymore, but the forever loyal Woody isn't having it and seeks to return home to Andy even if it means staying in a basement and never being played with again for the rest of his life. Meanwhile all the other toys believe Sunnyside Daycare is the perfect haven, but...let me just say it doesn't take long for the story to turn dark.      Out of all the Toy Story movies this one is surprisingly mature in all the right ways. I really like that because it's not one of those movies that try to talk down at kids. A lot of emotion was put into this film. Believe me when I say that I came close to crying 3 times throughout this movie, especially at the end. I haven't cried in a Disney movie since Up. In a way this could be a coming of age story as well due to how it portrays Andy growing up and no longer being interested in playing with toys.      A simple review can't begin to tell how good this movie is. Buy this on DVD, watch it on TV or OnDemand, or whatever. Just don't miss out on experiencing Toy Story 3.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|This is not a knife sharpener for daily use of course.  But it's good to leave in your pack in a pinch, because when you need to sharpen an overly dull knife in the middle of the woods, it's always a good idea to have something handy to sharpen with.    That said, there are many better pocket sharpeners out there if you have a little skill.  The DMT pocket is probably a good choice as diamond dust coated sharpeners can sharpen even the toughest metals.     For a novice sharpener like me though, this is more than plenty to get my pocket knife or bowie \\"sharp enough\\" for most campsite work.  The fact that it has a coarse and fine sharpener plus the rod for sharpening serrated edges makes this a good little worker at a barely noticeable weight.
0375842209|4.0|For history buffs or just those who want to know the whys and wherefores of this period(especially \\"Boomers\\" and younger readers)this is an important and thought provoking read.  I enjoyed it even though I don't belong to either group.  Another wonderful novel on this subject is Ursula Hegi's Stones from the River, set in Burdorf, Germany, during the years 1915-1951.  Read these two books and you will better understand and perhaps form an answer to the often asked question of how the German people could go along with Hitler and his plans for a Super Race. Or did they?
B0041KKYD8|1.0|Typical teen movie. The only real excitement was the little nudity. But even then you can save some time and go watch something else like short bus.
0316056863|4.0|I loved the first half of the book. I wish she would have continued through-out the book of her time as a child with her parents and the situations she was in. You learn so much about her, and her potty mouth! I never knew she spoke like this. I loved all the Chelsea Handler books and this book was somewhat similar, without sexual experiences, but the last half of the book was about her time at SNL and 30 rock. I read and understood but I wanted more about her and not the show.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I never like any of the other Star Trek movies. I don't even know if this one followed any of the other movies or tv shows. But I thought this movie was GREAT. I hope they are planning to make more. It got me hooked. I went to the movies three times to see it. It is a must see and a must have!
B000ULPFGS|5.0|Top tier cast flawlessly executing.  Extraordinary screenplay with more twists and turns than a Hitchcock classic.  Haunting and unforgettable music score.  Realistic, but biting NYC society culture from beat cop to billionaires with the right dash of political cynicism and historical context.  Witty dialogue with numerous quotable lines.  Complex but enjoyable and memorable characters played with a deft touch.  Artistic NYC architecture and street scenes creating the heightened stresses and expectations for the characters.  All brought together by a most gifted director who despite critical acclaim for trendy art pieces shows the pros how its done in a classic genre.      $184M worldwide grosses with less than 50% in the U.S.  4 actors and the director with prior Oscar nominations and two with wins. Zero Oscar nominations for Inside Man while Little Miss Sunshine garners Best Picture and Best Supporting Actress nominations.  Once again the Academy deserves little credit for recognizing obscure sweet cake bits of fluff over superior acting, directing, screenplay and score.     If you haven't seen it, you're missing a classic.
B001EC3JME|3.0|I purchased this holster for the Triton M30 Special opps flash light.  It's actually hard to insert the flashlight into the holster.  If the holster was a little larger, it would be a lot better. However, it is a good quality and well made.

B004J4WQ46|5.0|Well, they're back. 5 years was a little long for us to be patient but it was worth it. I'll break the album down song by song but first I'd like to point out something about Casablancas in this new form...He Sings!!! Before you could tell just how much of a crap he did not give in his songs and it was part of his charms, but I like the way he sings. Its still obviously him, but in a different way. Now the breakdown.    1) Machu Picchu: Energetic little track that has become one of my favorites by this band. It'll get you hooked.    2) Under Cover of Darkness: This is probably the most 'Strokes-ish' song on the album. Resembles them a lot but its very much different. As the first single this was a good song to use to ease the transition.    3) Two Kinds of Happiness: Feels kind of retro. The introduction has an 80's pop feel to it, but the song quickly jumps in to make use of both guitars and Julian's voice.    4) You're So Right: This is a mean little song, has a dangerous feel to it. Released as a b-side to Under Cover of Darkness, it took awhile to grow on me because its kind of a pissed off song, but eventually it became something I wanted to hear over and over.    5) Taken For A Fool: This song has an extremely staccato beat (for those of you who aren't musically trained, its a light quick beat) with a high arpeggiating guitar part. Good song, nothing memorable though.    6) Games: Even more of the 80's pop feel, it is a fun song but not very quick. Feels almost ballad-esque...if the strokes wrote that kind of thing.    7) Call Me Back: Ok, so this IS basically the Strokes ballad. Don't worry though, its an excellent piece of music.    8) Gratisfaction: A song with a bit of swing to it. This one is fun, hands down.    9) Metabolism: Another slightly mean one, but not as bad as You're So Right. This one is a walk down in its most basic form.    10) Life is Simple in the Moonlight: This one is more of uplifting in sound. One of the first songs heard before the album came out actually, it was played live on a late show.    There it is. Its a simple review of a simple album, but its a good listen so I recommend it to all.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I downloaded this game when it was free and, true to the reviews, it was very much like Myst, cleverly done yet not impossible. And then I was done, in less than an hour. The downside to this type of game is that there's no replay value-- once you've figured it out, you've figured it out for good and there's no mystery left. I'm glad I got it while free but if you love puzzle games like Myst, it's probably worth a dollar.
B002ZG98LO|2.0|This was better than some other Predator flicks. However, some of the films it beats were not good enough to be called 'Predator' movies so beating them is not saying much. After you get over the initial disappointment of what this movie could have been, it can slowly grow on you. Just be warned. It takes about 4 or 5 viewings to purge the initial bummed out feeling.    There are things I liked. It had no lame characters aside from Danny Trejo's Mexican thug who, for some odd reason, seemed extremely lacking in badassness next to the other characters. He almost seemed wimpy. Fortunately, that weakness was made up for by others. I was surprised to find myself liking the sniper chick. Her role could have easily been ridiculous, but the actress somehow made it believable. Adrien Brody was fine as a skinny tough guy. Way too much has been written about how wrong it was to cast a thin person as the hero. In the real world however, some of the toughest men I've met have not been large people. I also liked much of the green jungle setting aside from the Predator camp that screamed SET! Some of the CGI was fun like the insane sky reveal and the giant drill. The hounds were okay but they really weren't all that scary. If you can kill one with a prison shiv then big deal. But, by far, probably the best thing about the flick (aside from the idea of the setting - which rocked and could have rocked so much more) was Laurence Fishburne as the grizzled Aircav survivor. I've become weary over the years hearing how awesome and brilliant Fishburne is. I've seen him do some decent stuff for sure, but never anything that blew me away. Well, in Predators, he did in fact blow me away! I was giddy with how good he was. Even the way he said little lines like, \\"You talk... too loud.\\" was simply great. It was painful that his character was not on the screen longer.    Now for the junk I didn't like. The Predators still look like dudes in rubber suits. They come across as being too light fortheir size (like dudes wearing rubber suits). You don't get the impression they are massive, heavy creatures. I guess that was to be expected. No one has gotten that right since the first flick (if they did then) so why expect anyone to get it right now. It's a minor quibble next to the thing that annoyed me the most. Apart from the hounds and the running creature (and the face of one Predator if you can even count that)... there was not a single new monster presented on a planet where multitudes of deadly creatures have landed. Maybe they were all killed? Fine. What-ever. How about native life? Couldn't we have seen more of that (or Any of that)? Every jungle has its own crazy wildlife, some of it quite dangerous. Where was this jungle's indigenous life? I'll tell you where it was. It was safe in the studio's bank account... along with all the other interesting things we paid to see but did not see. That was my biggest gripe; the film reeked of cheapness. When I listened to the commentary Rodriguez repeatedly confirmed what a low budget they had. Well, guess what? It's not MY fault the studio decided to make a cheap movie but still charge me FULL price!! Roberto should have helped us viewers out by twisting some arms to put a few more things in. Sorry, but you failed us man. He was the producer. It is his job not only to watch costs, but to ask for a little more money here and there if the film needed to be fleshed out. I'll never pay full price to see a Roberto movie again until he stops being so cheap. A Predator movie is not a grind house movie. You don't go cheap on a Predator movie. But Roberto is not living on earth anymore. This has gone to his head. You can tell by the way he and the director incessantly pat each other on the back for doing such a wonderful job during the entire commentary track. By the way Roberto, shut up and let the director talk. You did not direct the movie. You talk more than a 13 year old girl. The director could barely get a word in.    After you get over the lack of cool stuff they could have done with the fantastic premise... you might finally be able to settle in and enjoy the flick for what it is; a fairly boring way to waste 90 minutes when you can't think of anything else to watch. So sad when the movie could have been a knock out!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's a great game, the first one I ever downloaded to my DroidX. Just wish Amazon would update quicker. My Ipad had the update this morning for 1.6.3.
B003UESJHE|5.0|What a brilliant movie! \\"The King's Speech\\" chronicles the rise of England's King George VI (Colin Firth), who inherits the throne after his lovesick brother abdicates, leaving Price Albert (\\"Bertie\\" to those closest to him) at the helm of a country on the brink of war. However, long before Bertie becomes king, he seeks the assistance of a speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) to help him get rid of a lifelong stammer. This is a wonderful film about friendship, duty, and perseverance. It's serious and touching and also downright hilarious at times (the sight of First and Rush doing their little vocal warm-up exercises never fails to crack me up). Overall, this is a great film, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nods.

A gripping and heartbreaking story, \\"Thirteen Reasons Why\\" will stun audiences and hit home with readers of all ages. Told through Hannah and Clay's eyes, readers will jump into their world in this thrilling and thought-provoking novel.
B003Y5H5KQ|1.0|Sorry folks but I sat through an hour of this movie and just couldn't take it anymore I had to turn it off. It never took off I couldn't completely understand the importance behind this little girl and how did her character play a part in counter intellergence, was she a hit women in training or what.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I have been reading a few reviews, and I feel that no one truly captured the essence of this book.  Many people have complained of its depressing nature, but living a life as a slave was never a happy experience.<br /><br />The Kitchen House is an adventurous tale told through the eyes of tragic figures.  The two main characters (Lavinia & Belle) are neither in a successful situation and even though one is white, while the other is black, they both struggle with the outcomes of their lives.  As the reader, I fall in love with Lavinia.  She is naive and innocent.  She sees everyone in a good light, including the antagonist of the novel.  This is her major flaw.  She can't understand evil in the world, and makes wrong assumptions left and right causing her much pain.  Belle, on the other hand, fully understands the implications of being a slave, and therefore never clears her name throughout the entire novel.<br /><br />I sincerely meant the idea that this book is an adventure.  There are a lot of exciting plot points; I lost many hours of sleep trying to get to the next chapter.  However, I do think that the book could have had more detail.  There are some parts, where the author chooses to \\"summarize\\" or dismiss because \\"it is too abhorrent to describe\\".  I don't quite understand why she would do that.  I thought the ending could have been a bit more elaborated on.  It's another summary that doesn't flow with the voice of the rest of the plot.<br /><br />If you like realistic points of view, and are okay with not reading a cheesy, predictable story, then this is the book for you.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|I knew the movie was dark and watched this anyways. I was glued to it from start to finish, even though it seemed wierd at times, and I didn't understand parts of it. I had to go online and google \\"The black swan meaning.\\" Awesome, convincing performance by Natalie Portman. As the movie unravelled more and more, I wondered what would happen next. The ballet performances were also neat to watch, but the plot is really what made me wondering what would happen next. What a movie, will be thinking and talking about it for awhile!
B004SKHJF2|2.0|tried a couple of songs that were played on tv shazam didnt recognize any of them after multiple tries, soundhound worked first try on all of them
B004JC16LC|5.0|Update May 18, 2011: I am upgrading my review of this set from four to five stars after listening to samples from all the tracks by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, and Wagner. While not all of these are the greatest performances or have the best sound available, the overall quality is impressive indeed -- a better ratio of hits to misses than I have experienced on other releases by the Membran label.<br /><br />For example, a comparison with the recently released boxed set [[ASIN:B004CHURXW Wilhelm Furtwangler: The Great EMI Recordings]] in cases where the performances here and on that set are identical, shows that with only a few exceptions this collection has at least as good sound as the EMI, if not better. Frequently the EMI versions show overly aggressive noise reduction that has sucked the brightness out of the high end of the original recordings.<br /><br />The recording of Tristan und Isolde was a pleasant surprise, beating out the EMI. And the Wagner Ring cycle performed with Italy's RAI Orchestra is pretty good -- it has significantly better dynamics than the off-brand transfer I currently own. (But note I haven't heard the Gebhart, which is supposed to be the reference edition.) However, Bach's St. Matthew Passion is just OK as it suffers from some distortion -- not quite up to another transfer I've heard. That is the most significant disappointment so far, although even there the recording is listenable.<br /><br />When this set arrived, the first thing I noticed is the size. It is truly enormous. I have a few of the big EMI box sets from a few years back -- like Karajan [[ASIN:B000ZBPQEO orchestral]] and [[ASIN:B000ZBPQEE operatic/vocal]], and the [[ASIN:B000TIO4Z0 Maria Callas set]]. I was thinking this set of 107 CDs would be just that much bigger than these 70-88 CD sets. Boy, was I wrong. If the EMI sets were the size of smallish cats, this set is about the size of a dachshund. That's a big difference.<br /><br />The reason for the gigantism is that this set is broken down into 11 smaller \\"wallet\\"-style boxes, which is actually kind of handy if you just want to take out works by Bach, Beethoven or Brahms, or the complete Ring cycle recorded with the RAI orchestra, for example. But having boxes within boxes makes for much bigger packaging overall. Not for the faint of heart. Actually, it does look pretty good.<br /><br />Membran claims that this set includes \\"every work that Furtw&auml;ngler recorded on record or 'live' for radio.\\" In cases where more than one recording of a work was made -- Membran cites Furtwangler's 12 recordings of Beethoven's 3rd as an example -- the company says \\"the most beautiful, or the best, or the most exciting interpretations were sought out for this collection\\". I was afraid that the \\"most exciting\\" loophole might mean that Membran would include a lot of recordings it deemed \\"exciting\\", even if marred by poor sound. So far, that doesn't seem to be the case.<br /><br />Membran also says that in addition to the selected full works, there are also \\"numerous bonus CDs and tracks presenting excerpts of alternative recordings.\\" As far as I'm concerned, they could have left these out, but thankfully the excerpting appears to take up only a handful of CDs from the set as a whole. And generally these excerpts, rather than the full works, seem to be the tracks that have poorer sound on average.<br /><br />Here is a breakdown, with some notes on the sound:<br /><br />BOX 1 - Baroque and pre-Classical Period<br /><br />CD 1 - Bach<br />- Orchestral Suite No. 3 BWV 1068 - Berlin Philharmonic 10/22/1948<br />- Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 BWV 1048 - Vienna Philharmonic 08/31/1950<br />- Brandenburg Concerto No. 5 BWV 1050 - Vienna Philharmonic 08/31/1950<br />SOUND: Mostly good for age, but Brandenburg No. 5 (with Furtw&auml;ngler on piano) is weaker.<br /><br />CD 2-4 - Bach<br />St. Matthew Passion - Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer, Marga H&ouml;ffgen, Anton Dermota, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Otto Edelmann, - Vienna Philharmonic, Vienna Singverein, Vienna Boys' Choir 04/14-17/1954<br />SOUND: OK for age but there are recordings available with much less distortion. This one isn't a top performer.<br /><br />CD 5<br />- H&auml;ndel - Concerto grosso in D major Op. 6 no. 5 - Berlin Philharmonic 04/22/1954<br />- H&auml;ndel - Concerto grosso in D minor op. 6 no. 10 - Berlin Philharmonic 12/19/1949<br />- Gluck - Alceste: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 10/28/1942<br />- Gluck - Iphig&eacute;nie en Aulide: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 03/08/1954<br />- JS Bach - Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 BWV 1048 (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />- JS Bach - Orchestral Suite No. 3 BWV 1068: Air - Berlin Philharmonic 1929<br />SOUND: All very good for age, but note the Gluck Alceste is from 1942 and the Bach excerpts from 1929-30.<br /><br />CD 6-7 - Gluck<br />- Orfeo ed Euridice - Fedora Barbieri, Hilde G&uuml;den, Magda Gabory, Chorus & Orchestra of Milan Scala 04/07/1951<br />SOUND: Not a great transfer, high end very muted by noise control mastering but the constant hiss is still fairly strong.<br /><br />BOX 2 - Beethoven<br /><br />CD 8-12 - Symphonies No. 1-9<br />- Symphony No. 1 - Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra - 07/13/1950<br />- Symphony No. 2 - Vienna Philharmonic 10/03/1948<br />- Symphony No. 3 - Vienna Philharmonic 11/26-27/1952<br />- Symphony No. 4 - Vienna Philharmonic 12/01-03/1952<br />- Symphony No. 5 - Berlin Philharmonic 05/27/1947<br />- Symphony No. 6 - Vienna Philharmonic 11/24-25/1952<br />- Symphony No. 7 - Vienna Philharmonic 01/18-19/1950<br />- Symphony No. 8 - Berlin Philharmonic 04/14/1953<br />- Symphony No. 9 - Bayreuth Festspiel Orchestra 06/29/1951<br />SOUND: Symphonies 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 9 are all the same performances featured on the \\"Great EMI Recordings\\" set. In most cases I found the sound of the Membran version to be at least as good as the EMI, although I'd give a slight edge to EMI on Symphonies 2 and 7. Symphony 1 has some record needle noise and distortion, and Symphony 5 is a live recording with middling sound. Symphony 8 has fine sound.<br /><br />CD 13<br />- Egmont Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 05/27/1947<br />- Coriolan Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 10/29/1951<br />- Leonore II Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 10/18/1949<br />- Gro&szlig;e Fuge Op. 133 - Vienna Philharmonic 08/30/1954<br />- Cavatina from String Quartet Op. 130 (Version for String Orchestra) - Berlin Philharmonic 1940<br />SOUND: Good all around, though a bit worse on the final track.<br /><br />CD 14<br />- Piano Concerto No. 1 - Adrian Aeschbacher, Lucerne Festival Orchestra 10/27/1947<br />- Piano Concerto No. 4 - Conrad Hansen, Berlin Philharmonic 12/03/1943<br />SOUND: Decent, muted on the high end probably due to noise control.<br /><br />CD 15<br />- Piano Concerto No. 5 - Edwin Fischer, Philharmonia Orchestra 02/19-20/1951<br />SOUND: Better and brighter than the identical performance on the EMI set.<br /><br />CD 16<br />- Violin Concerto - Wolfgang Schneiderhan, Berlin Philharmonic 05/18/1953<br />- Romance for Violin and Orchestra Nos. 1-2 - Yehudi Menuhin, Philharmonia Orchestra 04/09/1953<br />SOUND: Generally very good, a few incidents of noise. I like that they included the Schneiderhan performance, which of course features the Schneiderhan cadenzas.<br /><br />CD 17-18<br />- Fidelio - Martha M&ouml;dl, Wolfgang Windgassen, Gottlob Frick, Otto Edelmann, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 10/13-17/1953<br />SOUND: About the same as on the EMI set.<br /><br />CD 19<br />- Symphony No. 5: I - Berlin Philharmonic 10/16/1926<br />- Egmont verture - Berlin Philharmonic 1933<br />- Symphony No. 3: IV - Berlin Philharmonic 06/20/1950<br />- Symphony No. 9: I - Berlin Philharmonic 04/19/1942<br />- Symphony No. 9: II - Vienna Philharmonic 05/30/1953<br />SOUND: The older tracks show their age, otherwise good.<br /><br />CD 20<br />- Leonore III Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 06/02/1944<br />- PianoConcerto No. 4: III - Pietro Scarpini piano, RAI Symphony Orchestra of Rome 01/19/1952<br />- Violin Concerto: III - Erich R&ouml;hn violin, Berlin Philharmonic 01/12/1944<br />- Fidelio: Jetzt Sch&auml;tzchen, jetzt sind wir allein - Lisa della Casa, Rudolf  Schock, Vienna Philharmonic 08/03/1948<br />- Fidelio excerpts - Kirsten Flagstad, Josef Greindl, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Vienna Philharmonic 08/05/1950<br />SOUND: Mixed -- great on the Violin Concerto and pretty good on the 1950 Fidelio excerpts.<br /><br />BOX 3 - Brahms<br /><br />CD 21<br />- Symphony No. 1 - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />- Variations on a Theme by Haydn - Berlin Philharmonic 06/20/1950<br />SOUND: Good but live recordings that show their age.<br /><br />CD 22<br />- Symphony No. 2 - Berlin Philharmonic 05/07/1952<br />- Symphony No. 3 - Berlin Philharmonic 04/27/1954<br />SOUND: Good for age, no real issues.<br /><br />CD 23<br />- Symphony No. 4 - Vienna Philharmonic 08/15/1950<br />- Hungarian Dances Nos. 1, 3 and 10 - Vienna Philharmonic 04/04/1949<br />SOUND: Symphony No. 4 is OK, shows its age a bit with slight distortion and tinny sound. Hungarian Dances sound better than the same performances on EMI.<br /><br />CD 24<br />- Piano Concerto No. 2 - Edwin Fischer piano, Berlin Philharmonic 11/08/1942<br />SOUND: Variable, 2nd and 3rd movements pretty good for age but 1st and 4th are a bit muddier. Overall good for 1942.<br /><br />CD 25<br />- Violin Concerto - Yehudi Menuhin violin, Lucerne Festival Orchestra 09/1949<br />- Concerto for Violin and Cello - Willi Boskovsky violin, Emanuel Brabec cello, Vienna Philharmonic 01/1952<br />SOUND: Good -- same performances as on EMI set in better sound due to less aggressive noise control.<br /><br />CD 26<br />- A German Requiem - Kerstin Lindberg-Torlind, Bernhard S&ouml;nnerstedt, Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus 11/19/1948<br />SOUND: Some pretty heavy needle noise, and dynamics are poor. Listenable. Love the performance.<br /><br />CD 27<br />- Symphony No. 1: IV - Berlin Philharmonic 01/23/1945<br />- Symphony No. 2: I - Vienna Philharmonic 01/28/1945<br />- Variations on a Theme by Haydn - Northwest German Radio Symphony Orchestra 10/27/1951<br />- Violin Concerto: III - Gioconda de Vito violin, RAI Symphony Orchestra of Torino 03/11/1952<br />- Hungarian Dances Nos. 1 and 10 - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />SOUND: Excerpts, quality is variable. The first three sound great for their age, the last three fair to middling.<br /><br />BOX 4 - Bruckner<br /><br />CD 28-33<br />- Symphony No. 4 \\"Romantic\\" - Vienna Philharmonic 10/19/1951<br />- Symphony No. 5 - Vienna Philharmonic 08/19/1951<br />- Symphony No. 6 (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 11/13/1943<br />- Symphony No. 5: I - Berlin Philharmonic 10/28/1942<br />- Symphony No. 7 (Original Version) - Berlin Philharmonic 04/23/1951<br />- Symphony No. 8 - Berlin Philharmonic 03/15/1949<br />- Symphony No. 9 - Berlin Philharmonic 10/07/1944<br />SOUND: Mostly very high quality for their age, listenable and enjoyable, although Symphonies No. 7 and 9 are a bit dull and muted sounding.<br /><br />BOX 5 - Viennese Classical Period<br /><br />CD 34 - Haydn<br />- Symphony No. 88 - Vienna Philharmonic 12/05/1951<br />- Symphony No. 94 \\"Surprise\\" - Vienna Philharmonic 09/25/1950<br />SOUND: Really quite good on both symphonies, perhaps a bit muted at the high end but not bad.<br /><br />CD 35 - Mozart<br />- Symphony No. 39 - Berlin Philharmonic 02/08/1944<br />- Symphony No. 40 - Vienna Philharmonic 12/07-08/1948 & 02/17/1949<br />SOUND: No. 39 is the same performance as on DG's [[ASIN:B00005ONMK Wilhelm Furtwangler - Recordings 1942-1944, Vol. 1]], and the sound is about the same -- that is, a bit compromised but OK. No. 40 is the same performance as on the EMI set, and again the Membran has just a bit brighter sound.<br /><br />CD 36 - Mozart<br />- Serenade No. 10 for 13 Wind Instruments \\"Gran Partita\\" - Wind soloists of the Vienna Philharmonic 11-12/1947<br />- Serenade No. 13 \\"A Little Night Music\\" - Vienna Philharmonic 04/01/1949<br />SOUND: Very good once again on the Gran Partita. \\"A Little Night Music\\" shows its age just a bit more -- a little tinny and muted at the high end, but not too bad.<br /><br />CD 37 - Mozart<br />- Piano Concerto KV 466 - Yvonne Lef&eacute;bure piano, Berlin Philharmonic 05/15/1954<br />- The Escape From The Seraglio: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1933<br />SOUND: Piano Concerto shows its age, a bit noisy and muddy but a nice performance. Overture sounds just like 1933, but nothing unusual -- noisy and poor technology.<br /><br />CD 38 - Mozart<br />- Concerto for Two Pianos KV 365, Dagmar Bella & Paul Badura-Skoda piano, Vienna Philharmonic 02/08/1949<br />- Piano Concerto No. 22 - Paul Badura-Skoda piano, Vienna Philharmonic - 01/27/1952<br />SOUND: Both pieces a bit compromised -- record needle noise, noise control equalization. Listenable, but typical record transfers from the period.<br /><br />CD 39-41 - Mozart<br />- Don Giovanni - Cesare Siepi, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Anton Dermota, Otto Edelmann, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 08/06/1954<br />SOUND: Live recording from 1954, and considering that the sound is pretty good with nice definition of the singers, although it is not perfect with plenty of footfalls and such. This looks to be the same recording sold by EMI in [[ASIN:B000BNV8E8 this 3-CD set]], and judging by the reviews there I imagine the sound is about the same, but I can't make a direct comparison.<br /><br />CD 42-44 - Mozart<br />- Die Hochzeit des Figaro - Paul Sch&ouml;ffler, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Erich Kunz Maikl, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 08/07/1953<br />SOUND: Live recording 1953, same as [[ASIN:B000002S7T this performance]]. Sound is OK for age, but a little distortion in some places. My biggest problem is that this is not the original Italian, but a performance in German translation. May have been common practice at the time but I don't have to like it.<br /><br />CD 45-47 - Mozart<br />- The Magic Flute - Josef Greindl, Anton Dermota, Paul Sch&ouml;ffler, Wilma Lipp, Erich Kunz, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 08/01/1951<br />SOUND: This 1951 Salzburg Magic Flute derives from a recording of a radio broadcast, so this isn't great sound -- still pretty good considering its age and the recording conditions, and a great performance. Same recording as featured on [[ASIN:B000002S61 this 3-CD set]].<br /><br />CD 48 - Schubert<br />- Symphony No. 8 \\"Unfinished\\" - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />- Symphony No. 9 - Berlin Philharmonic 11-12/1951<br />SOUND: Pretty great for their age on both recordings.<br /><br />CD 49<br />- Schubert - Rosamunde (excerpts) - Vienna Philharmonic, 01-02/1951<br />- Mozart - Le nozze di Figaro Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1933<br />- Mozart - Don Giovanni (excerpts) - Tito Gobbi, Josef Greindl, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 07/27/1950<br />- Mozart - The Magic Flute: Hm! Hm! Hm! - Walter Ludwig, Karl Schmidt-Walter, Vienna Philharmonic 07/27/1949<br />SOUND: Very nice on Rosamunde, less so on the rest.<br /><br />BOX 6 - Romantic Period<br /><br />CD 50<br />- Mendelssohn - Violin Concerto - Yehudi Menuhin, Berlin Philharmonic 06/25-26/1952<br />- Mendelssohn - The Hebrides: Concert Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 08/19/1951<br />- Mendelssohn - A Midsummer Night's Dream: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 09/28/1947<br />- Schumann - Manfred Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1951<br />SOUND: Mendelssohn Concerto is the same performance as on the EMI set -- the sound here is excellent, pretty much identical to the EMI. The other tracks sound good, but not great -- a little muddy generally.<br /><br />CD 51 - Schumann<br />- Symphony No. 1 \\"Spring\\" - Vienna Philharmonic, 10/20/1951<br />- Symphony No. 4 - Berlin Philharmonic 05/14/1953<br />SOUND: OK on No. 1, a little muddy. No. 4 sounds great for its age.<br /><br />CD 52 - Schumann<br />- Piano Concerto Op. 54 - Walter Gieseking piano, Berlin Philharmonic 03/03/1942<br />- Cello Concerto - Tibor de Machula cello, Berlin Philharmonic 10/28/1942<br />SOUND: Both excellent for 1942.<br /><br />CD 53-54 - von Weber<br />- Der Freisch&uuml;tz - Alfred Poel, Oskar Czerwenka, Elisabeth Gr&uuml;mmer, Rita Streich, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 07/26/1954<br />SOUND: Looks to be the same performance as featured [[ASIN:B00004UB8H here]]. Quality is good for live recording in 1954.<br /><br />CD 55<br />- von Weber - Der Freisch&uuml;tz: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 03/05/1954<br />- von Weber - Euryanthe: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 05/04/1954<br />- von Weber - Oberon: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 02/01/1950<br />- von Weber - Invitation To The Dance - Berlin Philharmonic 1932<br />- Otto Nicolai - The Merry Wives Of Windsor: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 01/18/1951<br />SOUND: All excellent for their age, even the 1932 -- although it still sounds like good 1932.<br /><br />CD 56<br />- von Weber - Der Freisch&uuml;tz: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1926<br />- von Weber - Der Freisch&uuml;tz: Prelude to Act 3 - Berlin Philharmonic 1935<br />- Mendelssohn - Violin Concerto: III - Gioconda de Vito violin, RAI Symphony Orchestra of Torino 03/07/1952<br />- Schumann - Cello Concerto: Finale - Pierre Fournier cello, Berlin Philharmonic 11/13/1943<br />- Mendelssohn - A Midsummer Night's Dream: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1929<br />SOUND: All except the Violin Concerto excerpt are excellent for age, although many can't hide their age. The final track is mislabeled in the set as by Schumann, but it is really Mendelssohn.<br /><br />BOX 7 - Late Romantic<br /><br />CD 57 - Richard Strauss<br />- Sinfonia domestica - Berlin Philharmonic 01/12/1944<br />- Metamorphosen: Study for 23 Solo Strings - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />SOUND: Again, very good for age.<br /><br />CD 58 - Richard Strauss<br />- Don Juan - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1951<br />- Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks - Vienna Philharmonic 03/02-03/1954<br />- Death and Transfiguration - Vienna Philharmonic 01/1950<br />SOUND: Very good. Till Eugenspiel and Death and Transfiguration same performances as on the EMI set with no appreciable difference in sound.<br /><br />CD 59<br />- Richard Strauss - Four Songs - Peter Anders, Berlin Philharmonic 02/15/1942<br />- Richard Strauss - Four Last Songs - Kirsten Flagstad, Philharmonia Orchestra 05/22/1950<br />- Gustav Mahler - Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen - Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Philharmonia Orchestra 06/24-25/1952<br />SOUND: Four Songs are outstanding for 1942. Four Last Songs are tough listening due to record needle noise and general poor transfer. The Mahler is in excellent studio sound.<br /><br />CD 60 - Hindemith<br />- Symphonic Metamorphosis on a Theme by Carl Maria von Weber - Berlin Philharmonic 09/16/1947<br />- Concerto for Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 06/20/1950<br />- Symphony \\"Harmony Of The World\\" - Vienna Philharmonic 08/30/1953<br />SOUND: All good, none great. No real noise issues, just recordings that show their age in somewhat thin sound. The Concerto for Orchestra is the same performance as featured on the [[ASIN:B0029LJ9IM big Audite set of RIAS recordings]] a few years back. The Audite sounds a tiny bit better, but the difference is not great.<br /><br />CD 61<br />- Stravinsky - Symphony in Three Movements - Vienna Philharmonic 08/15/1950<br />- Stravinsky - Le Baiser de la fee - Berlin Philharmonic 03/18/1953<br />- Hans Pfitzner - Symphony in C major - Vienna Philharmonic 08/07/1949<br />SOUND: Sounds like noise control has muted the Stravinsky pieces a lot, but even so the fact that Furtwangler was not a towering figure among Stravinsky conductors shines through. The Pfitzner still sounds muted with noise control, but less so.<br /><br />CD 62<br />- Hans Pfitzner - Palestrina (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 06/10/1949<br />- Gustav Mahler - Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen: Die zwei blauen Augen - Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Vienna Philharmonic 08/19/1951<br />- Richard Strauss - Don Juan - Venezuela Symphony Orchestra 03/21/1954<br />- Richard Strauss - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />SOUND: A bit muted on the Pfitzner (but the work itself was a great surprise that made me want to hear the whole thing rather than just the excerpts here). The Mahler is from a live performance with clear sound -- so clear you can hear the audience just great as well. The 1954 Venezuela Strauss sound more like 1929, and the 1930 Strauss sounds its age.<br /><br />BOX 8 - Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Sibelius, Liszt, Smetana<br /><br />CD 63 - Tchaikovsky<br />- Symphony No. 4 - Vienna Philharmonic 01/08-10/1951<br />- Serenade For Strings Op. 48 (excerpts) - Vienna Philharmonic 01/01-02/1950<br />SOUND: Studio recordings from 1950-51, sound is very good, must be from tapes, definitely not an LP transfer.<br /><br />CD 64<br />- Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 5 - RAI Orchestra of Torino - 06/06/1952<br />- Smetana - Die Moldau (Vltava) - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1951<br />SOUND: Mediocre on the Tchaikovsky -- a record transfer with both noise and noise control. The Smetana sounds brilliant and multidimensional, I really love this except from \\"Ma Vlast\\" with the extensive quotes from the Rheingold Vorspiel.<br /><br />CD 65<br />- Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 6 \\"Path&eacute;tique\\" - Berlin Philharmonic 10-11/1938<br />- Liszt - Les Pr&eacute;ludes - Vienna Philharmonic 03/03/1954<br />SOUND: The Tchaikovsky is good, but only for age -- record needle noise is not too bad. The Liszt sounds great -- studio recordings apparently transferred from tapes.<br /><br />CD 66<br />- Sibelius - Violin Concerto - Georg Kulenkampff violin, Berlin Philharmonic - 02/07/1943<br />- Sibelius - En Saga - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1943<br />- Dvor&aacute;k - Slavonic Dance Op. 46 no. 3 - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />SOUND: Sibelius Concerto is great for wartime recording, I doubt it could get better. En Saga is practically as good. Dvor&aacute;k is pretty good for heavily noise-controlled 1930 record transfer, but don't expect a lot.<br /><br />BOX 9 - Wagner<br /><br />CD 67<br />- Siegfried-Idyll - Vienna Philharmonic 02/16-17/1949<br />- The Flying Dutchman: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 03/30-31/1949<br />- Tannh&auml;user Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 12/02-03/1952<br />- Parsifal (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 03/15/1938<br />SOUND - All pretty good for LP or 78 transfers, but with some hiss and noise. Parsifal from 1938 has weakest sound.<br /><br />CD 68<br />Lohengrin (Excerpts from Act 3) - Franz V&ouml;lker, Maria M&uuml;ller, Margarete Klose, Josef von Manowarda - Bayreuth Festspiel Chorus & Orchestra 07/19/1936<br />- Lohengrin, Prelude to Act 1 - Vienna Philharmonic 03/04-05/1954<br />SOUND - All but last track are 1936 recording with weakish sound and record needle noise. 1954 Prelude sounds great.<br /><br />CD 69-72 - Wagner<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg - Jaro Prohaska, Josef Greindl, Benno Arnold, Bayreuth Festspiel Chorus & Orchestra 1943<br />SOUND - 1943 live recording, noticeable needle noise, crowd noise, and generally a bit tinny sound. Doesn't seem like a bad transfer, just limited quality on the original.<br /><br />CD 86-89<br />- Wagner - Tristan und Isolde - Ludwig Suthaus, Kirsten Flagstad, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Philharmonia Orchestra 06/10-22/1952<br />SOUND: Great! I was very pleased that this is basically a good quality studio recording from the old EMI release. No big sound issues here, and for my money the sound is better than on EMI's own latest release, where noise reduction has muted the tone a bit too much.<br /><br />CD 90-91 - Wagner - Ring excerpts - Live at Milan Scala 1950<br />- Das Rheingold - Ferdinand Frantz, Angelo Mattiello, Joachim Sattler, Alois Pernerstorfer, Milan Scala Orchestra03/02-11/03/1950<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - G&uuml;nther Treptow, Hilde Konentzni, Kirsten Flagstad, Ferdinand Frantz, Milan Scala Orchestra 03/09-16/1950<br />- Siegfried - Set Svanholm, Peter Markwort, Kirsten Flagstad, Milan Scala Orchestra 03/22/1950<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung - Max Lorenz, Ludwig Weber, Kirsten Flagstad, Milan Scala Orchestra 04/04/1950<br />SOUND: Good quality live recordings with some crowd noise<br /><br />CD 92 - Wagner - Die Walk&uuml;re Act I<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - Leonie Rysanek, Ludwig Suthaus - Vienna Philharmonic - 09-10/1954<br />SOUND: From the 1954 studio recording, very good sound<br /><br />CD 93-94 - Wagner excerpts<br />- Tristan und Isolde: Prelude - Berlin Philharmonic - 04/27/1954<br />- Tristan und Isolde: Mild und leise wie er l&auml;chelt - Erna Schl&uuml;ter, Staatskapelle Berlin 10/03/1947<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg: Was duftet doch der Flieder - Rudolf Bockelmann, Vienna Philharmonic 09/05/1938<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg - Vienna Philharmonic 04/04/1949<br />- Parsifal: Karfreitagszauber - Berlin Philharmonic 04/25/1951<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re: Du bist der Lenz, nach dem ich verlangte - Maria M&uuml;ller, Vienna State Opera Orchestra 02/13-17/1936<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - Rudolf Bockelmann, Covent Garden Opera Orchestra 1937<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Trauermarsch - Berlin Philharmonic 1933<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Starke Scheite schichtet mir dort - Kirsten Flagstad, Philharmonia Orchestra 07/23/1952<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Siegfrieds Rheinfahrt - Rome Symphony Orchestra - 05/31/1952<br />SOUND: Variable but mostly quite good. Some typical issues with sound from 1930s recordings.<br /><br />BOX 10 - Wagner - The Ring of the Nibelungen<br /><br />CD 73-74 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Das Rheingold - RAI Symphony Orchestra 10/26/1953<br />CD 75-77 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Die Walk&uuml;re - RAI Symphony Orchestra 10/29-11/06/1953<br />CD 78-81 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Siegfried - RAI Symphony Orchestra 11/1953<br />CD 82-85 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung - RAI Symphony Orchestra 09/1953<br />SOUND: Really pretty good, and better dynamics than my current edition of this performance, which is an off-brand release. I haven't heard the Gebhart edition of the RAI Ring Cycle, which is supposed to be the reference release, but this one is a fairly good transfer.<br /><br />BOX 11 - Other<br /><br />CD 95<br />- Arthur Honegger - Mouvement symphonique No. 3 - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />- Fortner - Concerto for Violin and Large Chamber Orchestra - Gerhard Taschner violin, Berlin Philharmonic 12/18/1949<br />- Boris Blacher - Concertante Music for Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 04/27/1954<br />SOUND: Excellent on the Honegger, only slightly weaker on the Fortner and Blacher, which are featured in the same performances and about the same quality on the Audite set mentioned above.<br /><br />CD 96-97 - Hector Berlioz<br />- The Damnation Of Faust - Frans Vroons, Hans Hotter, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Lucerne Festival Orchestra and Chorus 08/26/1950<br />SOUND: Three strikes -- tinny, noisy and sung in German translation. But I doubt anyone is buying a Furtw&auml;ngler box for the Berlioz.<br /><br />CD 98<br />- Franck - Symphony in D minor - Vienna Philharmonic 1954<br />- Ravel - Daphnis et Chlo&eacute;: Suite Nr. 2 - Berlin Philharmonic 03/21/1944<br />SOUND: Great on the Franck and great for live wartime on the Ravel.<br /><br />CD 99<br />- Cherubini - Anacreon: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 01/11/1951<br />- Johann Strauss II - Emperor Waltz, Pizzicato-Polka - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1950<br />- Johann Strauss II - Die Fledermaus: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1937<br />- Rossini - The Thieving Magpie: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />- Rossini - The Barber of Seville: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1935<br />SOUND: The Cherubini is OK, but not great -- the same performance sounds a bit better on the EMI set. Strauss waltzes sound great. Starting with the Fledermaus overture we're in the 1930s -- pretty good to excellent for age, but still 1930s.<br /><br />CD 100<br />- Ernst Pepping - Symphony No.2 - Berlin Philharmonic 1943<br />- Heinz Schubert - Hymnic Concerto for Soloists, Organ and Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 1942<br />SOUND: Great for wartime on the Pepping and pretty good on the Heinz Schubert -- which I found to be a very interesting piece.<br /><br />CD 101-102<br />- Furtw&auml;ngler - Symphony No.2 - Berlin Philharmonic 12/1951<br />- Bartok - Violin Concerto No.2 - Yehudi Menuhin violin, Philharmonia Orchestra 09/12-13/1953<br />SOUND: The Furtw&auml;ngler sounds like a decent studio recording, good but not outstanding for 1951. The Bartok has seen many releases by EMI. It sounds fine here, but the version on the latest EMI release sounds a bit better.<br /><br />CD 103<br />- Furtwangler - Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra - Edwin Fischer piano, Berlin Philharmonic 01/19/1939<br />SOUND: Noise control has done an excellent job in both controlling the noise and sucking all brightness out of the recording. Not at all bad for 1939, but definitely noise control run amok.<br /><br />CD 104-105<br />- Verdi - Othello - Ramon Vinay, Dragicia Martinis, Paul Schoffler, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 08/07/1951<br />SOUND: Not bad, but a live recording from 1951 where the microphones picked up the entire stage and some of the hall too. Typical early 1950s live opera recording in that sense. At least this one is in Italian.<br /><br />CD 106<br />The Salzburg Song Recital<br />- Hugo Wolf - Morike-Lieder, Goethe-Lieder, Italienisches Liederbuch (excerpts), Spanisches Liederbuch (excerpts), Sechs alte Weisen (excerpt), Sechs Lieder fur eine Frauenstimme (excerpt), Eichendorff-Lieder - Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Wilhelm Furtwangler piano 08/12/1953<br />SOUND: Schwarzkopf is microphoned pretty well, but the piano less so. I heard just a little distortion in louder passages. Still not too many sound issues.<br /><br />CD 107<br />Excerpts from rehearsals, speeches and interviews<br />SOUND: Mixed. Will appeal to a minority, but interesting.

The final track is mislabeled in the set as by Schumann, but it is really Mendelssohn.<br /><br />BOX 7 - Late Romantic<br /><br />CD 57 - Richard Strauss<br />- Sinfonia domestica - Berlin Philharmonic 01/12/1944<br />- Metamorphosen: Study for 23 Solo Strings - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />SOUND: Again, very good for age.<br /><br />CD 58 - Richard Strauss<br/>- Don Juan - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1951<br />- Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks - Vienna Philharmonic 03/02-03/1954<br />- Death and Transfiguration - Vienna Philharmonic 01/1950<br />SOUND: Very good. Till Eugenspiel and Death and Transfiguration same performances as on the EMI set with no appreciable difference in sound.<br /><br />CD 59<br />- Richard Strauss - Four Songs - Peter Anders, Berlin Philharmonic 02/15/1942<br />- Richard Strauss - Four Last Songs - Kirsten Flagstad, Philharmonia Orchestra 05/22/1950<br />- Gustav Mahler - Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen - Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Philharmonia Orchestra 06/24-25/1952<br />SOUND: Four Songs are outstanding for 1942. Four Last Songs are tough listening due to record needle noise and general poor transfer. The Mahler is in excellent studio sound.<br /><br />CD 60 - Hindemith<br />- Symphonic Metamorphosis on a Theme by Carl Maria von Weber - Berlin Philharmonic 09/16/1947<br />- Concerto for Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 06/20/1950<br />- Symphony \\"Harmony Of The World\\" - Vienna Philharmonic 08/30/1953<br />SOUND: All good, none great. No real noise issues, just recordings that show their age in somewhat thin sound. The Concerto for Orchestra is the same performance as featured on the [[ASIN:B0029LJ9IM big Audite set of RIAS recordings]] a few years back. The Audite sounds a tiny bit better, but the difference is not great.<br /><br />CD 61<br />- Stravinsky - Symphony in Three Movements - Vienna Philharmonic 08/15/1950<br />- Stravinsky - Le Baiser de la fee - Berlin Philharmonic 03/18/1953<br />- Hans Pfitzner - Symphony in C major - Vienna Philharmonic 08/07/1949<br />SOUND: Sounds like noise control has muted the Stravinsky pieces a lot, but even so the fact that Furtwangler was not a towering figure among Stravinsky conductors shines through. The Pfitzner still sounds muted with noise control, but less so.<br /><br />CD 62<br />- Hans Pfitzner - Palestrina (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 06/10/1949<br />- Gustav Mahler - Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen: Die zwei blauen Augen - Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Vienna Philharmonic 08/19/1951<br />- Richard Strauss - Don Juan - Venezuela Symphony Orchestra 03/21/1954<br />- Richard Strauss - Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />SOUND: A bit muted on the Pfitzner (but the work itself was a great surprise that made me want to hear the whole thing rather than just the excerpts here). The Mahler is from a live performance with clear sound -- so clear you can hear the audience just great as well. The 1954 Venezuela Strauss sound more like 1929, and the 1930 Strauss sounds its age.<br /><br />BOX 8 - Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Sibelius, Liszt, Smetana<br /><br />CD 63 - Tchaikovsky<br />- Symphony No. 4 - Vienna Philharmonic 01/08-10/1951<br />- Serenade For Strings Op. 48 (excerpts) - Vienna Philharmonic 01/01-02/1950<br />SOUND: Studio recordings from 1950-51, sound is very good, must be from tapes, definitely not an LP transfer.<br /><br />CD 64<br />- Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 5 - RAI Orchestra of Torino - 06/06/1952<br />- Smetana - Die Moldau (Vltava) - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1951<br />SOUND: Mediocre on the Tchaikovsky -- a record transfer with both noise and noise control. The Smetana sounds brilliant and multidimensional, I really love this except from \\"Ma Vlast\\" with the extensive quotes from the Rheingold Vorspiel.<br /><br />CD 65<br />- Tchaikovsky - Symphony No. 6 \\"Path&eacute;tique\\" - Berlin Philharmonic 10-11/1938<br />- Liszt - Les Pr&eacute;ludes - Vienna Philharmonic 03/03/1954<br />SOUND: The Tchaikovsky is good, but only for age -- record needle noise is not too bad. The Liszt sounds great -- studio recordings apparently transferred from tapes.<br /><br />CD 66<br />- Sibelius - Violin Concerto - Georg Kulenkampff violin, Berlin Philharmonic - 02/07/1943<br />- Sibelius - En Saga - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1943<br />- Dvor&aacute;k - Slavonic Dance Op. 46 no. 3 - BerlinPhilharmonic 1930<br />SOUND: Sibelius Concerto is great for wartime recording, I doubt it could get better. En Saga is practically as good. Dvor&aacute;k is pretty good for heavily noise-controlled 1930 record transfer, but don't expect a lot.<br /><br />BOX 9 - Wagner<br /><br />CD 67<br />- Siegfried-Idyll - Vienna Philharmonic 02/16-17/1949<br />- The Flying Dutchman: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 03/30-31/1949<br />- Tannh&auml;user Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 12/02-03/1952<br />- Parsifal (excerpts) - Berlin Philharmonic 03/15/1938<br />SOUND - All pretty good for LP or 78 transfers, but with some hiss and noise. Parsifal from 1938 has weakest sound.<br /><br />CD 68<br />Lohengrin (Excerpts from Act 3) - Franz V&ouml;lker, Maria M&uuml;ller, Margarete Klose, Josef von Manowarda - Bayreuth Festspiel Chorus & Orchestra 07/19/1936<br />- Lohengrin, Prelude to Act 1 - Vienna Philharmonic 03/04-05/1954<br />SOUND - All but last track are 1936 recording with weakish sound and record needle noise. 1954 Prelude sounds great.<br /><br />CD 69-72 - Wagner<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg - Jaro Prohaska, Josef Greindl, Benno Arnold, Bayreuth Festspiel Chorus & Orchestra 1943<br />SOUND - 1943 live recording, noticeable needle noise, crowd noise, and generally a bit tinny sound. Doesn't seem like a bad transfer, just limited quality on the original.<br /><br />CD 86-89<br />- Wagner - Tristan und Isolde - Ludwig Suthaus, Kirsten Flagstad, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Philharmonia Orchestra 06/10-22/1952<br />SOUND: Great! I was very pleased that this is basically a good quality studio recording from the old EMI release. No big sound issues here, and for my money the sound is better than on EMI's own latest release, where noise reduction has muted the tone a bit too much.<br /><br />CD 90-91 - Wagner - Ring excerpts - Live at Milan Scala 1950<br />- Das Rheingold - Ferdinand Frantz, Angelo Mattiello, Joachim Sattler, Alois Pernerstorfer, Milan Scala Orchestra03/02-11/03/1950<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - G&uuml;nther Treptow, Hilde Konentzni, Kirsten Flagstad, Ferdinand Frantz, Milan Scala Orchestra 03/09-16/1950<br />- Siegfried - Set Svanholm, Peter Markwort, Kirsten Flagstad, Milan Scala Orchestra 03/22/1950<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung - Max Lorenz, Ludwig Weber, Kirsten Flagstad, Milan Scala Orchestra 04/04/1950<br />SOUND: Good quality live recordings with some crowd noise<br /><br />CD 92 - Wagner - Die Walk&uuml;re Act I<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - Leonie Rysanek, Ludwig Suthaus - Vienna Philharmonic - 09-10/1954<br />SOUND: From the 1954 studio recording, very good sound<br /><br />CD 93-94 - Wagner excerpts<br />- Tristan und Isolde: Prelude - Berlin Philharmonic - 04/27/1954<br />- Tristan und Isolde: Mild und leise wie er l&auml;chelt - Erna Schl&uuml;ter, Staatskapelle Berlin 10/03/1947<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg: Was duftet doch der Flieder - Rudolf Bockelmann, Vienna Philharmonic 09/05/1938<br />- Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg - Vienna Philharmonic 04/04/1949<br />- Parsifal: Karfreitagszauber - Berlin Philharmonic 04/25/1951<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re: Du bist der Lenz, nach dem ich verlangte - Maria M&uuml;ller, Vienna State Opera Orchestra 02/13-17/1936<br />- Die Walk&uuml;re - Rudolf Bockelmann, Covent Garden Opera Orchestra 1937<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Trauermarsch - Berlin Philharmonic 1933<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Starke Scheite schichtet mir dort - Kirsten Flagstad, Philharmonia Orchestra 07/23/1952<br />- G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung: Siegfrieds Rheinfahrt - Rome Symphony Orchestra - 05/31/1952<br />SOUND: Variable but mostly quite good. Some typical issues with sound from 1930s recordings.<br /><br />BOX 10 - Wagner - The Ring of the Nibelungen<br /><br />CD 73-74 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Das Rheingold - RAI Symphony Orchestra 10/26/1953<br />CD 75-77 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Die Walk&uuml;re - RAI Symphony Orchestra 10/29-11/06/1953<br />CD 78-81 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: Siegfried - RAI Symphony Orchestra 11/1953<br />CD 82-85 - Wagner - Der Ring des Nibelungen: G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung - RAI Symphony Orchestra 09/1953<br />SOUND: Really pretty good, and better dynamics than my current edition of this performance, which is an off-brand release. I haven't heard the Gebhart edition of the RAI Ring Cycle, which is supposed to be the reference release, but this one is a fairly good transfer.<br /><br />BOX 11 - Other<br /><br />CD 95<br />- Arthur Honegger - Mouvement symphonique No. 3 - Berlin Philharmonic 02/10/1952<br />- Fortner - Concerto for Violin and Large Chamber Orchestra - Gerhard Taschner violin, Berlin Philharmonic 12/18/1949<br />- Boris Blacher - Concertante Music for Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 04/27/1954<br />SOUND: Excellent on the Honegger, only slightly weaker on the Fortner and Blacher, which are featured in the same performances and about the same quality on the Audite set mentioned above.<br /><br />CD 96-97 - Hector Berlioz<br />- The Damnation Of Faust - Frans Vroons, Hans Hotter, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Lucerne Festival Orchestra and Chorus 08/26/1950<br />SOUND: Three strikes -- tinny, noisy and sung in German translation. But I doubt anyone is buying a Furtw&auml;ngler box for the Berlioz.<br /><br />CD 98<br />- Franck - Symphony in D minor - Vienna Philharmonic 1954<br />- Ravel - Daphnis et Chlo&eacute;: Suite Nr. 2 - Berlin Philharmonic 03/21/1944<br />SOUND: Great on the Franck and great for live wartime on the Ravel.<br /><br />CD 99<br />- Cherubini - Anacreon: Overture - Vienna Philharmonic 01/11/1951<br />- Johann Strauss II - Emperor Waltz, Pizzicato-Polka - Vienna Philharmonic 01/24/1950<br />- Johann Strauss II - Die Fledermaus: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1937<br />- Rossini - The Thieving Magpie: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1930<br />- Rossini - The Barber of Seville: Overture - Berlin Philharmonic 1935<br />SOUND: The Cherubini is OK, but not great -- the same performance sounds a bit better on the EMI set. Strauss waltzes sound great. Starting with the Fledermaus overture we're in the 1930s -- pretty good to excellent for age, but still 1930s.<br /><br />CD 100<br />- Ernst Pepping - Symphony No.2 - Berlin Philharmonic 1943<br />- Heinz Schubert - Hymnic Concerto for Soloists, Organ and Orchestra - Berlin Philharmonic 1942<br />SOUND: Great for wartime on the Pepping and pretty good on the Heinz Schubert -- which I found to be a very interesting piece.<br /><br />CD 101-102<br />- Furtw&auml;ngler - Symphony No.2 - Berlin Philharmonic 12/1951<br />- Bartok - Violin Concerto No.2 - Yehudi Menuhin violin, Philharmonia Orchestra 09/12-13/1953<br />SOUND: The Furtw&auml;ngler sounds like a decent studio recording, good but not outstanding for 1951. The Bartok has seen many releases by EMI. It sounds fine here, but the version on the latest EMI release sounds a bit better.<br /><br />CD 103<br />- Furtwangler - Symphonic Concerto for Piano and Orchestra - Edwin Fischer piano, Berlin Philharmonic 01/19/1939<br />SOUND: Noise control has done an excellent job in both controlling the noise and sucking all brightness out of the recording. Not at all bad for 1939, but definitely noise control run amok.<br /><br />CD 104-105<br />- Verdi - Othello - Ramon Vinay, Dragicia Martinis, Paul Schoffler, Vienna State Opera Choir, Vienna Philharmonic 08/07/1951<br />SOUND: Not bad, but a live recording from 1951 where the microphones picked up the entire stage and some of the hall too. Typical early 1950s live opera recording in that sense. At least this one is in Italian.<br /><br />CD 106<br />The Salzburg Song Recital<br />- Hugo Wolf - Morike-Lieder, Goethe-Lieder, Italienisches Liederbuch (excerpts), Spanisches Liederbuch (excerpts), Sechs alte Weisen (excerpt), Sechs Lieder fur eine Frauenstimme (excerpt), Eichendorff-Lieder - Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Wilhelm Furtwangler piano 08/12/1953<br />SOUND: Schwarzkopf is microphoned pretty well, but the piano less so. I heard just a little distortion in louder passages. Still not too many sound issues.<br /><br />CD 107<br />Excerpts from rehearsals, speeches and interviews<br />SOUND: Mixed. Will appeal to a minority, but interesting. Apart from the musical parts of the rehearsals -- the first four of 11 tracks on the disc -- you'll need to understand German.<br /><br />CD-ROM<br />- Electronic booklets: biographical and track listing.

B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|The original Evangelion was a very dark, almost humourless and ultimately confusing series. Since its original release there have been attempts, in manga and two previous cinematic releases, to bring alternative versions of the story to its many fans and try to both clarify the deeper meanings of the original and lighten the overall somber tone of the anime.    This re-imaging manages to do both, while retaning the basic plot certain elements have been changed which make the characters more human and less doom leaden, several sub plots have been ether changed or omited, again it would seem to appeal to both fans, old and new, and a more general audience.   While this review may seem rather vague, it is writen more to intrigue readers to view both the original and the new releases and compare them for themselves, because to explain any further would spoil both the story and intriguing concepts it has to offer.

B003UESJH4|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />Earning Oscars for itself as well as for its star, Colin Firth, \\"The King's Speech\\" is an entertaining historical drama whose intelligent writing and superb acting allow it to triumph over its conventional theme.<br /><br />In this real-life version of \\"Pygmalion,\\" Firth plays Prince Albert (aka the Duke of York, aka King George VI), the British royal whose severe speech impediment haunted him throughout his early life and made being a monarch difficult in a time when a new little device called radio made speaking in public a necessity for anyone serious about being a respected leader on the world stage.  Geoffrey Rush costars as Lionel Logue, the unlicensed speech therapist and part time stage actor who helped him overcome his affliction.<br /><br />Written by David Seidler (who himself suffered from a stammer as a child) and directed by Tom Hooper, \\"The King's Speech\\" is very much in the mold of all those fusty, do-gooding, inspirational biographies that always seem to grab the lion's-share of trophies when awards season comes around.  However, this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls of the genre by being less about the physical affliction and more about the psychological issues underlying that affliction.  Indeed, in their numerous sessions together, Lionel turns out to be more psychotherapist than speech coach for a man who - due to his position as a member of a tightly circumscribed and stiff-upper-lipped monarchy - has no one but this comparative stranger to confide his innermost thoughts and feelings to.  Clearly wise in the ways of human nature, Lionel rightly determines that Albert's affliction has less to do with any kind of physical ailment than with his bottled-up feelings towards his father, the unforgiving taskmaster King George V, and his older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, whose own dalliance with a divorced American commoner leads him to abdicate the throne after only a short period, thereby clearing the way for Albert to assume his rightful place as England's king.  Lionel determines that, more than anything else, it's fear - of humiliating himself in public, of failing to live up to the standards set by a demanding and uncompromising father, of not being able to fulfill the duties his royal birth has thrust upon him - that is the real underlying cause of Albert's problem.  And Lionel, commoner though he may be, isn't shy about confronting the king with some frank truths about himself when he deems it necessary.  He even insists on addressing his royal pupil as \\"Bertie,\\" the nickname only his immediate family could previously use.  And, of course, the stuttering itself becomes a part of a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, as it continually eats away at not only Albert's image of himself as a man but his confidence as the individual who's just been handed the heavy burden of leading a beleaguered and frightened nation through the perilous days of World War II.<br /><br />Firth and Rush are both magnificent in their roles, establishing an amazing chemistry between them, as the royal and the commoner brush aside the arbitrary distinctions of division and class to meet on the ground of their common humanity.  Firth never overplays the stuttering, and the expressions of pain and frustration that periodically flit across his face when he's trying so desperately to be understood make us empathize with his predicament entirely.  Likewise, Rush has never seemed more relaxed and confident than he does here, providing a perfect foil for the king's faltering self-confidence.  In lesser hands, the role of Lionel could easily have degenerated into low comedy buffoonery, but Rush never gives in to the temptation, giving us instead a richly shaded and thoughtfully understated portrayal of the character.<br /><br />There is fine work too by Helena Bonham Carter as Albert's devoted and supportive wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York; an English-accented Guy Pearce as Edward, Prince of Wales; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Claire Bloom as Albert's mother, Queen Mary.<br /><br />But the film is Firth's and Rush's all the way.Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Claire Bloom as Albert's mother, Queen Mary.

0812550706|5.0|Enders Game after Battlefield Earth by L. Ron Hubbard is my FAVORITE science fiction story I've read so far! I really enjoyed that story and was hooked to the end. I liked it so much I ended up reading that whole series. I have to say Volume 1 is the best in the series, but they are all good. I recommend it to any one that wants to read a good story. It's definitely NOT a waste of time. It's action packed, it's got smart strategy and it's just a fun story!

1594202842|5.0|I was curious about the book after hearing all the hypes surrounding the article in WSJ and I am so glad that I did. First and foremost, it is a memoir about her struggle as a mother and not a parenting book per se. Yes, there were parts where she sounded conceited and superior and I suspect that was more to reflect the contrast in how she started out her parenting journey on a high horse and eventually she ate the humble pie. The book showcases her journey of becoming the mother that is suited for her children. I absolutely think she is a brilliant and funny writer. Funny to those who appreciate her humor. The fact that her children love her (as evident in the last chapter) shows that they know she has their best interest at heart. You judge a tree by the fruits. Please do read the entire book. I read the book twice. The first time I read it I wasn't impressed but I was determined to finish reading it. The turning point came two-third through the book and I found myself growing to like her and appreciate her unwavering love and dedication to her children. I wish I had the same tenacity and strength to instill the right values to my future child(ren).
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game, and I'd love more like this! Not too short with pretty good graphics and entertaining music. Sets a great mood. Highly recommended!
0143038419|1.0|The first problem with this book is that the author was advanced money to go on a travel around the world to \\"find herself\\" and the true meaning of existence.     Ignoring that for a moment, I decided to give this book a shot. Being the New York Times Best Seller's list is a great reason to giving this book a shot. The majority of people who read this can't be wrong, right? Not to mention, I was a bit down in a rut about trying to figure out what life is at a young age.    Well, at the end of this book, I felt like I wanted to get in my car, and drive off the bridge. I cannot believe this is a number one seller. I look around to my left and right and think, \\"All these people read this book and found a truth? They consider this book to be the ultimate truth to discovering what life is and what you are in this world?\\" I felt like I wanted to vomit in disgust with everything this book represents and felt it should be renamed: Narcissism, Pray, and Selfishness.     The first problem is how this book starts. Gilbert clearly states that she is unhappily married. That is fine and all, but it doesn't just end there. She wants to find herself. So what does she do? Well she leaves her husband, leaves the house, and everything. Not only that, after the divorce, she felt so down and in a rut still that she went to have another relationship! Surprisingly it failed again, but then again it couldn't be happy ending for all since the book would be about 10 pages long. So we find out that she travels to Europe to \\"find herself\\" that is paid by her publishing company so she can write a book.    Well her trip through Europe made her happier than anything. She ends up eating everything, buying stuff, spending money in \\"donation\\" to help her, having a relationship everywhere she goes, learning a few things about the local language and religion (and thereby becoming the expert in it) and just end up feeling satisfied that not only can she do these things but also write a book about it!Throughout this book we see a single theme: me, me, me (or in this case Gilbert since she wrote it, but imagine that is what is going on through her head). She finds out that her fantastic life where she's married, got a house, and set for life just isn't good enough. No it needs more but in the form of being paid by someone else and in return getting paid even more money after writing a book about how hard it is, but she also wants you to feel the same way because it is terrible that one should be married and condemned to a life of mediocre.    I felt disgusted about this book. I honestly thought it was a book about how a woman would go to Europe and discover her self and end up doing something fantastic in this world. After reading this book, I went to volunteer everywhere I could just hoping that I could wash away the filth that I read in this book and pray that I'm never this selfish in life. I always thought that people were kind of selfish in this world and this book really opened my eye to that. This book says it's okay to abandon everything as long as you're happy about it, and that it's okay to use other people's fortune (or misfortune) to make yourself happy. It's sort of like if you wanted to feel better about your fortune you should drive through the poorest part of the city, find someone really poor and talk with them to hear their story but use to to validate yourself and how difficult it is in your life but you feel better because you don't have it as bad as that person. While doing this, you should have other people pay for your car, hotel stay, and money so you can eat tons of food at this place. That's this book in a nut shell.    I think I stand a bit corrected. This book has helped me in some way. It makes me want to help out the world for a change and try not to be selfish or even desire to be with someone as selfish as this author. I honestly hope I never have to meet someone like this and I rather be around people who actually find joy and happiness in helping others than someone who uses other people to \\"find\\" their happiness through self pleasures.    I wouldn't be surprised if we soon find books about how it's not only okay to abandon your husband but your children too if they're giving you a hard time and making you unhappy and other people have to pay/care for your children and also pay to make sure you're happier and then write a book about how hard it is to have children.

Sade music is sexy, smooth, easy listening. Sade can be the \\"icing on the cake\\" for a romantic evening, or relaxing music for long road trip. You can't beat the price! and the company packages the product really well, so no cracks or damage. I would definitely recommend this product!
B003UYUR10|5.0|I have no words for this movie, but it's beautifully done. There is no negative things about it at all. Beautiful set & graphics, great acting, incredible story line. I know it's based on games, and I have not played the games yet. But I'm looking forward for more parts. The story itself took approximately two hours. It was incredible plot, full of details and amazing journey. I couldn't stop watching it once I've started. Definitely my type of a great movie. As I've said above, I wish to see more parts for the movie. And I'm so grateful the movie was not short but the whole two hours of it! I just love it and I want more from the same director with the same cast(prince and princess)!
1594481717|5.0|I'm a big new fan of Daniel Pink and this book is one reason why. The insights he provides here help to uncover the new thinking we will all need, both as individuals and as a country, to be successful in the 21st century. Highly recommended - read this first, then read his latest book, Drive. Real eye-openers!
B0001I561E|3.0|My daughter loves this movie.  I ordered it just in time for Valentine's Day.  She knew it was coming.  When I got the package, I could tell the movie was loose in the case.  I know I should not have opened it, but she was so excited I just hoped for the best.  Of course the movie was scratched and skips during part of it.  It was a brand new movie, it was a shame.  When I tried to contact the seller to see if there was anything that could be done, like replace the movie, I never heard anything back from them.  Any response would have been nice.
030746363X|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect so I didn't have any expectations other than a good read. However, the concepts intrigued me so I tried out a few things and began my body recomposition that is continuing & can be described as OUTSTANDING! Working out about 1 hour a week and even having binge day while shedding fat! It far exceeded what I would have set, had I even set expectations!   Glad he doesn't have the shackles of initials behind his name because he's free to do, test, believe, prove, or disprove things that others blindly accept!   Once you buy this book, you may end up buying it as a great gift for others.... I've already given away 3! Enjoy & rest assured this is the book the fads don't want you to read!
0345350499|5.0|Prior to reading this book, I knew very little of King Arthur and his legend and had no interest in it at all. Some years ago, I asked one of my dearest friends (very well-read and now a professor at a major university) to recommend a book for me at a very hard time in my life. She immediately recommended \\"The Mists of Avalon\\". Though a bit daunted by the 900+ pages in the book, I began reading and was never able to put it down. Whatever parts may actually be legend and others be historically factual, for me I found a connection in this book that I never expected to make, and certainly didn't expect it to help me through the hardships I was experiencing (the 1st time I read it). But there is something so magical and hypnotic about the way that Marion Zimmer Bradley tells the story, that I rediscovered myself in it and began a fascination with the historical rituals and information about the birth of a relatively new religion (Christianity) and the practice of the prominent religion prior to Christianity (Paganism) and how the two blended and differed at a time when one of them was being lost as a piece of history. But even more so, I regained my feeling of power as a woman. This book was absolutely cathartic for me, and it opened a door for my desire to know more about history....everywhere - something I'd NEVER had any interest in before, and to this day I still feel that connection and purpose I found all those years ago the first time that I read it, and cannot wait to read it for the 4th time. It's overdue. Trust me, you don't have to have any knowledge or even any interest in the Legend of King Arthur to fall in love with this book. It is a must have, especially for any woman who is open to hearing, respecting, and learning about the evolution, existence, and history of two very different religions with a completely open mind, and who is looking for inner strength and power for who they are.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|The first episode of The Walking Dead left me with some doubts about the show, but by three episodes in, I was feeling a lot better about it.  While the show is set in a zombie apocalypse, much of the drama is focused around the humans, their relationships and their struggle to survive.  With a bit of retweaking, this show could probably be about a group or survivors in another type of disaster.  I don't mean to say that there isn't plenty of zombie antics, because there is.<br /><br />At first, I thought that it'd be another show where character drama was stretched out over several seasons, but the writers actually seem to do the opposite.  Character tensions are resolved fairly quickly and new characters will come and go pretty often.  I think the pacing of the show is great.  The plot of season one though, could have been a bit more awesome.  It felt like the writers were on the verge on doing something really interesting, but kept holding back.  When they finally tried to do something great for the finale, it came across a little hokey and silly, if that's even possible for a zombie TV series.  I don't want to give too much away, but it felt like they missed a great opportunity to explain some of the backstory of the disaster to leave us on an intelligent cliffhanger and instead went with an overly dramatic ending.<br /><br />The DVD set comes on two discs with four episodes on disc one and two episodes plus extras on disc two.  The extras are pretty good too: making of, inside \\"The Walking Dead\\", sneak peek, behind the scenes, convention panel, trailer, extra footage, interviews, etc.  Overall, I think it's a fun series to watch and I'll definitely be watching season two in hopes that they do something a bit more interesting.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I love this game. So reminds me of MYST from back in the day. Great puzzles and very fun. I also wish it was longer and a little spookier.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|really useful app for those with phones that don't have native cm support and those with tm support record songs read track also has police frequencies so you know when the feds are after you
0061801313|5.0|I begged my mom to buy me this book, after watching the show on ABC Family. When I finished it, I just HAD to read the rest of the series! The series keeps you on your toes and with so many twists, you will never get bored with it! But I would NOT recommend this to anyone under 13--at the least. Mostly because of the large amount of cursing and adult situations. If you are old enough to understand the book, you will be hooked for sure. I'm still not done with the series but I can't wait for books 9, 10, 11, and 12 to come out!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I purchased the Mic because it got a lot of good reviews on here. When I got it in I popped in the battery and tried it with my iPhone, Computer, and a Sony Camcorder. It didn't work with any of them. My computer could see that I was trying to use it but nothing. I read some more reviews that recommended changing the battery and not using the one that shipped with it, so I went out and bought a battery. After that it seemed to record at a very low volume on the computer but not the Camcorder or the iPhone, it also crackled the whole time.<br /><br />Not quite sure what was wrong with it, it has a lot of really good reviews so perhaps I got a bad unit. At any rate I am going to go with something else.
B004QXJZXA|5.0|So you have the likes of Grand Prix, Bullit, Rendezvous and on any given sunday but nothing comes close to capturing the passion, excitement and tension of motorsport/driving as Le Mans.     So glad Paramount decided to remaster this amazing classic it should be a must own for any car/racing enthusiast.
B004P9FAK2|1.0|Sigh.  Once again the Ultimate edition is lacking the extended version.  What is the point of the Ultimate Edition then?      The movie is great, but this edition is not worth the extra money.  Just buy the regular Blu-Ray.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Absolutely excellent! Best concert I have ever watched, and will continue to watch over and over again!! Harmonies are still tight, music/guitars haven't lost a thing in 30 years!! Horn line is awesome and only adds to the energy and entertainment. BUY THIS DVD!!! You will not be disappointed.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I had very high hopes for this controller because I am originally an XBOX/XBOX 360 gamer who got a PS3 so that I could play Portal 2 on Steam (so much for THAT plan, either...)  I know that the Dualshock controller has many fans but I'm not one of them.  I've owned a PS2 and never liked the controller then, either.    Anyway, this controller is physically a great approximation of the XBOX 360 controller with a few minor differences.  The left stick feels a little too far to the left for me, maybe because the shape of the grips is a bit different so your thumbs end up positioned differently than on a real 360 controller.  The build quality is good, too.  It's too bad that the controller can't communicate directly with the PS3 via Bluetooth.  I'm not sure if this limitation is for cost reasons or if Sony prevents it somehow.  The controller comes with a \\"dongle\\" that you have to fill a USB slot with in order to use it.  I'm not sure if you need one for ever Power A controller, or not.    The controller feels good in the hands and has the proper heft.  Unfortunately, it falls down terribly in the area of response.  If this were the only controller you ever used on the PS3, you may not notice, but compared with the DualShock 3 controller the deadzone on the Pro Elite is just too wide.  The stick has to be pushed over a third of the way in any direction before it will respond at all, making quick, precise motions impossible.  I was only trying to play Portal 2, which is VERY forgiving of the controller by design.  I can't imagine trying to play something faster paced like Killzone or Call of Duty with this.    Regretfully, I have to give it two stars.  I really wanted to love this controller and I was very excited to find it with a Google search, but it just seems like they cut corners on this thing, or maybe their QA process is subpar, since reviews seem to range all over the place.    Can't recommend this one.  Anybody know of an alternative?
B004132I4S|5.0|Beauty is in the eye of the beholder... that IS the wonder of music  But everyone, just listen to this album...  and let it grow, flower... into your mind, heart, soul  Sufjan Stevens sounds like no other artist on this planet  Enuff said!
B004FOA84A|4.0|Sure i played the game in an hour but it was fun. The graphics were very well done, something my wife and i are always looking for in a point &amp; click game. I hope this company puts out more of these spooky games :).
B0042EJD8A|5.0|super fast delivery from amazon (as always) and I have the software to decrypt US movies so we were watching this \\"down-under\\" within 2 weeks of ordering it. This is a MUST SEE for everyone living on planet earth and if it doesn't scare the be-jesus out of you and make you very VERY angry at the \\"powers that be\\" then I don't know what will.     CSG extraction and \\"fracking\\" licences are being granted across Australia ... this movie is at the forefront of any thinking persons fight against the big business/politicians who are so willing to sell out our health and livelihoods of tomorrow for a quick buck today.    Buy it, watch it and then start lobbying your politicians!
030746363X|5.0|Best weight loss book ever! I carried this thing around with me for a month absorbing as much information as I could. I Lost 17 lbs in a 1 1/2 months. I suggest this book to anyone who is interested in taking responsibility for there own physical health.     Best!
B000JCETC4|5.0|Greetings readers!  Many moons ago, when as a boy of 6 or 7 I chose to lend a sharp ear to the harmonies of some young kids, named George, Paul, Ringo and John (I defy the customery name order), I began to feel a sense of brotherhood with these people we call musicians.  They became my family members, whilst oblivious to this notion by a little 1st grader.  I will hit my point in a moment, please bear with me.  When George passed away, I felt I had truly lost an older brother, although I lived in Tehran, Iran.  His \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and all other wonderful melodies still put a chill on my spine, nearly fifty Springs later.  I do realize this is a Review Box for Pink Floyd, who too are amongst my family members on this vast expansive ranch.  Yes friends, these icons in my view are permanent fixtures whose memories, sounds and words have  etched themselves onto my heart and soul for ever and a day!  I have yet to hear a slice of music in which one now highly missed Richard Wright has not shaken the earth beneath my world.  I distinctly miss him.  To many, I may sound like a pansy.  The truth is, I am a man with soul and emotions.  Music is much more than a cheap commodity for me, and I, more than a boy with a few dollars with no purpose.  Music to me is Oxygen for the soul.   I digress.  Gilmour is a consummate perfectionist.  \\"High Hopes\\" on the DVD, is the gateway for my imaginary world of utopian values, where the \\"Grass is greener\\", \\"and the lights are brighter...\\".    I'm glad he's involved some youngsters in his tours, to pass some of his genes on.  Long live good music, the players, and the true fans to help steer the mother ship towards audible ecstasy.  Peace, love and happiness to all of you.
B004E2XAFW|5.0|\\"The Unforgiving\\" is a conceptual CD, which tells the story of a old woman who brings \\"bad\\" people back to life to redeem themselves by battling evil.  This is the first concept album I have bought since Kiss' \\"The Elder\\".  Without Temptation have always been very intelligent with their music, but they have outdone themselves.  The music and lyrics are great.  The sound changed just slightly, but is still Within Temptation.  The orchestrations are beautiful, and that mix of metal go hand in hand.  If you are a WT fan, don't miss out buying this CD.  You won't regret it!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I have not had this adapter long enough to determine its longterm durability, but I do use the Cinema to HDMI adapter and I love it. Simply put, go with the higher quality adapters. I know you can get something from China on eBay for $2 but look at the cost of the device you are plugging into your computer.. It deserves to function properly.
B003UESJHE|3.0|Movie is fantastic.  Special Features section has a disturbing problem on my disc:  The \\"Inspirational Story\\" has 1/4 of the video cut-off at the top thru-out the entire segment.  Anyone else have this defect on theirs?
030746363X|5.0|Yo bro dawg. This book changed my life. I lost 50lbs of fat, gained 30lbs of muscle and I learned how to give my gf screaming wild orgasms. Now all her friends want to have threesomes with us!!! There is so much other cool stuff in the book I haven't tried yet. This book is amazing, and the things it advocates are REAL. I hear them advocations screaming all night!! Haha. Yo thank you Dr.Timothy Ferriss. You're changing the world. I wonder how human body research will change due to your awesome book.     4HOUR BODY 4 LYFE!!! MAKE MONEY$$
B002ZG99TA|5.0|Movie is well written.  Denzel Washington & Chris Pine's performances are gripping,yet both characters  never overpowered  each other.  Action/suspense from departure to destination.  A winner !
B0001CCY7E|5.0|One of my best choices to date. I don't typically buy movie soundtracks, but this one is very powerful and worth every cent.  Not your \\"typical\\" western songs, I could see in my mind the scenes of the movie unfurrowling before me. A good listen on a long drive or a rainy night, in your home.  Packed and shipped well. Prompt.
160059672X|5.0|Another 5 start crafting book from Lark. I've been interested in bead weaving - and have thought I would like to try my hand at it. This book is one of the best I've seen. The designs are original and gloriously beady. Bling in all the right places. Clear, well illustrated instructions are a hallmark of the way Lark does books - and this book is no exception to the rule. I can always count on being able to understand the way something is made when the photographs and written instructions are clear enough.<br /><br />This is a 'feast your eyes' book as well and instructional. Exquisite creations that will, I'm sure, make you want to adorn yourself with beaded beauties - and make gifts for your friends as well.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|...the answer is they both win and we all lose. Anyways, this is great, came brand new unopened and plastic wrapped in its case and for a heck of a lot cheaper than anywhere else you will buy (unless you go used of course). Came in right amount of time maybe a day earlier, but I don't need to tell you about 24, because if you are buying this then you already know.
159562015X|1.0|DO NOT ORDER IF USED!!! Access code can only be used once! I ordered a used copy of the book, but didn't know that the access code in the back can only be used for one person, one time... SOoooo basically worthless since I can't take the test. Now I have to order a new copy.
030746363X|5.0|Already before the German translation of the 4HB was published, I ordered my Kindle version in English. The book is really worth reading. It is fascinating how Mr Ferris develops new ideas, far away from the mainstream.
B004HMYNFK|5.0|I first discovered the series through the HBO mini-series (which I loved) and took the plunge to actually read the books.  Normally I would not read the book after seeing the film because generally they are so different, however, I was absolutely, positively thrilled when I discovered how close the two were.  No distractions at all.  The characters and writing are so warm and generous that once I finished the first book, I had to read the second.  (I am now on book six.)  Rarely does one feel both happy and satisfied at the end of a mystery, but that is the feeling I get after each book.  Well worth the time.  Enjoy and savor.
B000001DWG|5.0|Awesome sounding album, this band originated out of Green River area in WA. Before Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Alice and Chains. This album is a must for all fans of those bands. Such an original sound I recommend picking it up and get just a little educated on the band. Google \\"Mother Love Bone\\" and read up on them.
B004FOA84A|4.0|It was fun, a little frustrating toward the end I had to get help via internet .  I wish they would make more of these games!
B003L20IFQ|1.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS!  The Hollywood left has apparently ceased believing that allegorical screeds have to be entertaining to the masses.  This plodding, monotonous fable makes its message clangingly clear:  capitalism is uncannily evil; the U.S. military is diabolical; Westerners are greedy, vulgar, and weak; Middle-Eastern terrorists are simply poverty-stricken people driven to desperation.  And the West will collapse, buried by the symbolic sands of the third world.    Worst of all, this film's creators imagine its audience to be so obtuse that its one character is scripted to scream out every dawning revelation that his own wicked employer and incompetent government care not a whit for him and would rather see him die than risk lawsuits and bad publicity.  The presentation of the amorality of these institutions is, in fact, so over-the-top that it totters on the rim of surrealism.    Trapped in a primitive wooden box but totally dependent on modern technology, the protagonist utilizes a cell phone, flashlight, glow stick, and lighter.  But does he investigate a snake's burrow that likely leads to the surface or attempt to use a broken board to dig through a presumed three feet of loose, sifting sand?  Alas, there's no American ingenuity in this first-world everyman, who merely downs liquor and nerve pills and waits lamb-like for rescue.  He's metaphorically unmanned by an Arabian snake down his pants and his compliance in cutting off his own digit.  He haplessly shouts obscenities at helpful-minded females on the phone and even seeks hollow solace from his senile mother.  In his tomb-to-be, he embodies the liberal vision of Western society's doom.
0316010669|4.0|This book is written in a great way. It keeps you turning the pages until the last page. However as the author is journalist and not a psychologist, folks who expected a technical book might be disappointed. Nevertheless a great read for an everyday person.
B00406UK5A|4.0|Be it ever so humble, there's no place like Rome and all these Romans want to do is make it home but with an expert tracker, who's after their heads and mile after mile of being hunted on foot, these poor guys don't look like they have much of a chance.  Or do they...  Not a bad effort if you can take it on a pure guts and glory survival quest.  I liked it, it held my interest.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this album, every song on it is great. Its to bad that some of the best songs on the album don't get any time on the radio. Dust Bowl Dance, White Blank Page and Awake My Soul are some of the unsung wonders of this album.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|I have been addicted to everything Jennifer Hudson since the first scene she appeared in during \\"Dreamgirls\\".   Her latest CD I Remember Me is good with many enjoyable and motivational songs. To get the most out of this CD, you have to buy the deluxe edition being sold at Target that includes four additional songs plus a DVD. The song What You Think is my favorite. It has a different style than you'd expect from her and the remix of Where You At is the only version I will listen to. The title track which she co-wrote describes her life after the loss of her murdered family members...powerful lyrics. I Got This is a great, uplifting song that makes you want to smile and inspires you to keep moving forward. The Brooks and Dunn cover, I Believe, is the gospel song on this CD. I love what she did with a country song. She definitely made it her own. Still Here is a tribute to her slain family. This song is a must-hear for anyone who has lost someone they love. It reminds us all that death is unavoidable but your loved ones will always be a part of you in your heart, mind and soul.   There are some songs which don't really do much for me. Gone is a song I don't particularly care for, but it should be her first major crossover song. Why Is It So Hard is another song that doesn't seem to find its groove. The songs penned by Alicia Keys have a sort of old school disco/house music feel and take me back to the 80's, in a good way.  Overall I think this is a stellar album from a stellar performer. I wholeheartedly recommend it and wish her nothing but success and happiness.
0786838655|4.0|I've always found mythology entertaining, so I was very curious about this book. Overall, I liked the way Riordan plays with mythology. For the most part, he stays pretty true to the characters of mythology, with all of their imperfections (it always bugs me a bit when Greek mythology gets corrupted into a dualistic good vs. evil battle).<br /><br />The adventures are entertaining, but the story does feel a little too derivative of the Harry Potter concept (I have not gotten around to reading Harry Potter books myself, BTW).<br /><br />Still, I strongly recommend this book and the ones that follow. It's a great adventure which slips in some excellent humor, but does not shy away from the darker aspects of the source mythology, either, IMO.
B00000K3D4|5.0|One of my favorite movies since I was a child, Labyrinth remains one of those movies that never grows old.  If you have never seen it before, it tells the story of a young girl who wishes that her baby brother is taken away by goblins.  But when the goblins really do steal away the child, it's up to Sarah to find her way through to the goblin city at the center of the Labyrinth and rescue him.  Along the way, she will encounter all kinds of fantastic creatures and people: a fairy that bites, a gentle ogre that can summon rocks, talking worms, the ultimate hoarder, and many more.  It is a wonderful journey that you won't forget.<br /><br />Labyrinth is one of the most visually beautiful films you will ever see.  The sets and puppets are works of art.  The visuals really carry the sense of wonder with them.  Watching the movie, you actually feel like you are in another world, and that the characters in it are as real as the human actors.  The world of the Labyrinth is a kind of dark wonderland, where things aren't always what they seem.  Beautiful things aren't nice.  Ugly things aren't bad.  Scary-looking things are harmless, while things that look harmless are dangerous.<br /><br />There is a wonderful coming-of-age story here as well.  Sarah is caught with one foot in the fanciful world of youth, and one in the dangerous world of adults.  She is not really ready to grow up, but at the same time, she wants to.  The scene where she wanders into the ballroom, looking lost among the masked adults visually tells us the whole story.  The film is great about showing, rather than telling, its themes.  You can know Sarah just as well by looking around her bedroom as by seeing the way she acts.  The scene where the Owl is left on the outside looking in through her window as she plays with her friends perfectly conveys the loneliness of someone left on the outside, as unable to cross into Sarah's fantastical world of childhood as she was unable to fit into his fantastical world of adulthood.  The film places great value on fantasy and imagination, and tells us that we don't have to be in a hurry to grow up.<br /><br />This is a timeless fairy tale.  Spectacular visuals and fun songs carry the fantastic elements of the story, but you can tell that every set piece, every puppet character was constructed lovingly to be a part of the world.  Sadly, modern computer-generated worlds do not have the same sense of love in their creation.  They can be flashy and colorful, and sometimes even pretty, but I've not seen any CGI world compare with the dark beauty of the Labyrinth and its fantastic denizens.  The characters and story are simple, beautiful, and wonderful.  And no matter how many times you visit their twisted world, you never tire of it.  This film holds just as much fun and wonder for me as an adult as it did when I was a child.  There are not many films that can do that, but Labyrinth is one of them.  It remains one of the best fantasy films of all time.The film places great value on fantasy and imagination, and tells us that we don't have to be in a hurry to grow up.

1596680296|5.0|I'll admit, I was intimidated by the idea of knitting socks! But that's one of the main reasons that I started knitting.  Knee socks that actually came to my knees!!!!  When I read a book like this, my eyes tend to glaze over and it all seems like gibberish.  Went to the instructions and started disecting the instructions one line at a time, referring back to the details of the instruction; the words and pictures.  Wrote them all out (none of that *k1p1, repeat from *).  And it all started to make sense.  Then began actually knitting. always referring to the text to be sure it was going correctly.  Suddenly, it was EASY!!!!!!!!! The photos are good, the instructions require patience if you are like me and get that glazed over feeling when you read them. But when you do get past that, they are fairly straight forward.    it took some time to get the hang of using dpns and maintaining the tension.  The first sock was on 4ply 100% cotton, 50g ball, only ankle and foot,  and had to be pulled out cause the toe was BAD!  Still, it fit well enough that I was able to see my foot required changes in the pattern for a better fit.  So the next sock was knitted.  and changes yet again. and then the third sock was knitted and it was good!  They are going to be bed socks as the material doesn't lend itself to really being shoe socks.  The next sock was in an acrylic/wool blend and what worked in cotton didn't work in this lighter and stretchier material. Fortunately, was still working in waste yarn and made appropriate changes with the next socklet.  Perfection!    The instructions are based on guage of yarn, with lots of options for making a basic sock.  There is still, obviously, differences in how certain yarn behaves over others, so be prepared to rip out and adjust as needed.  Once you've done a pair, the confidence level rises and then you can go on and do some the fancier stitches.  Almost feel ready to do two together - but not quite!

B0038NN3B4|5.0|OK, here's the deal for me.  In September I realized I needed to lose around 50 pounds.  I went for the low-fat, whole grain, portion control approach; and stuck to it pretty well.  In more than seven months I lost 17 pounds and was miserable and frustrated the entire time.  In less than two weeks on Atkins, I have lost 8 pounds, and  have never felt deprived!     I am in a situation where I end up eating out a lot.  With my other diet, this just made me feel more frustrated.  But on this plan, I feel like I can stick with it anywhere.  If I'm in a high end place, it's all about the meat/fish and veggies anyway.  And if it's a burger joint, I just skip the bun and the fries! The sodium doesn't seem to be an issue, surprisingly.      For breakfast I have been making 2 egg omlettes with frozen veggies and cheese.  Lunch is usually tuna or chicken salad on a bunch of greens/veggies.  Dinner is some kind of grilled or broiled meet with asparagus etc.  (I throw on some rice pilaf etc. for the rest of the family).  I went to Whole Foods today and saw the \\"prepared foods\\" section with a whole new eye!  I didn't even want to stare at the pizza!      One of the things that appealed to me most was that exercise is not a core part of this plan.  I have a permanent disabling injury that prevents me from just about anything (beyond WII!).  It was refreshing to not feel stigmatized for that.    And I'm even cheating!  Shoot me but I really enjoy a glass of wine when I'm done with my day, (or at least my driving). Generally an hour or so before I eat.  I've kept that for my sanity the safety of my family.  (It's only 4 to 5 carbs!) So I still have around 20 pounds to go.  Which no longer sounds so daunting.    Just losing 8 pounds feels great!    I respect other people's right to choose, and right to write more mainstream diet books.  And I hope that they will respect that I feel like I finally caught a break here!
B0041KKYCY|1.0|I just had to stop by and give my two cents on this video, having seen some of the original.  Crap like this should be banned...I mean there are simply some things you should NOT make movies about.  Rape is one of them.  Seriously, half the movie is just one big rape scene...and the rest is murder and sex.  It was a sick movie back then and is a sick movie now.  If you fantasize about rape and can sit through graphic rape scenes without feeling an ounce of disgust and feel depressed afterwards, this is the movie for you.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|As the author recommends, I skipped around in the book and decided to do only the diet part and not the exercising, supplements, sleep or sex stuff! The slow carb diet was easy to follow and effective. My weight loss was not dramatic, but I'm not overweight to begin with. The big difference was in my body shape! For the first time in years, I am comfortable wearing a bikini swimsuit. The slow carb diet, I swear, burned fat off my thighs in a way I never thought possible.    I'm a 39-year-old mother of two, 5'11\\" tall and I weigh about 155. Even after going off the slow carb diet, the few pounds I lost have not come back. I feel like I enjoyed permanent loss of at least 3 pounds of fat, after being on slow carb for about a month. Since I don't aspire to be a model, I have no need or interest in losing 20 pounds. But for me, the person who wanted to lose a little bit of weight and become more lean...the slow carb diet worked.    Just bought a kettle bell, so we'll see how that part of it works out!
B003UESJHY|5.0|Absolutely outstanding entertainment will be found in watching this film.  The story is captivating, the characterizations are all \\"spot on\\", and the direction is first rate.  I highly recommend this one, and I trust you will enjoy it as much as I did.
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I'd heard of this CD from a random review in the local paper, and had never heard of Joe Bonbassa before, neither had the local CD shop so off to Amazon. I'm not disapointed the first track [slow train coming] seals it with the most amazing loping growling  beat, some of the best blues ever. the album, darst though some of the other genres,; bluegrass, rockabilly etc but mostlyy sticks to the blues.     a great album with bits for a party and dancing, and other beats to get you pumped for soem sort of dangerous activity. Keep an eye on the bloke.

0525951652|5.0|This is a huge, sweeping story, encompassing many characters, events, and countries. At nearly a thousand pages, this book is not for the faint of heart. What it is, however, is a wonderful, entertaining work of historical fiction, written by a master storyteller, for those who enjoy that genre.<br /><br />With well-developed characters and a riveting plot, the author takes the reader down memory lane. The world of the early twentieth century is presented with all its class distinctions, and the events that lead up to World War I and beyond are beautifully integrated into this sweeping saga that focuses on the British, the Americans, the Germans, and the Russians.<br /><br />The tragedy of World War I and its aftermath, the Russian revolution, the suffragette movement, the erosion of class distinctions, and the emergence of a middle class, are some of the seminal historical benchmarks that are touched upon in this epic novel. The evolvement of these events is seen through the lives of the main characters, and the reader is able to see how these events impact upon each of them.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this well-written book and could not put it down for the two days that it took me to read it. It was certainly time well spent, and I most definitely look forward to reading the other two books that will be forthcoming in this trilogy.
B001UV4XHY|3.0|Usually I enjoy David Yates films and expected this newer installment to be better but I found that it was both enjoyable and boring at the same time.<br />I have no beef with the actors, just David.

B000Q66JXA|4.0|It's difficult to do justice to the psychology, morality, and mythology of the Arthurian legends in 2h20m, but Boorman does a creditable job. The first cut was 3h, so it's possible scenes that fleshed out the details were dropped. The result is a rather \\"schematic\\" presentation of the tale. It's not the \\"mess\\" Roger Ebert decreed it, but Boorman assumes you have a fair grasp of the story, and don't need detailed explanations of motive and character. If you don't, you can be rather lost on the first viewing. Despite its faults, \\"Excalibur\\" is one of the best \\"King Arthur\\" films.<br /><br />The image quality ain't very good. Nearly every scene looks as if it was shot through a fog filter. For a film that should be visually lush, the contrast is way too low. (Jacking it all the way up on my plasma display helped a great deal.)<br /><br />I initially reported that the sound was terrible. I pulled out the LV this morning and synched up the players. The sound was considerably better (I don't know why), and there was little or no difference between the two formats. I suspect the apparent difference was caused by my listening in the afternoon, when my hearing often declines.<br /><br />It's probably possible to do a better transfer from the camera negative (if it exists), but that isn't going to happen soon, if ever. Regardless, the price is low enough to justify purchase. Not to mention Nicole William's screwy turn as Merlin.

B004KD5TQI|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this soundtrack.  It fits the movie almost perfectly and every time I listen to it, it makes me think of the movie.  Of the nine songs on this soundtrack, there are only two that I'm not crazy for, the rap mash-up of \\"we will rock you\\" and \\"i want it all\\", and the cover of \\"Love is the Drug\\".  The other seven songs are what I gave the five stars to.  The techno rock style of the covers fits the style of the movie like a glove.  The first three songs are my top picks for this one: Emily Browning's cover of \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\", Bjork's \\"Army of Me\\", and \\"White Rabbit\\".  Emily Browning sings two of the other songs as well, and if I can be so bold as to say that she has a great voice and should sing more along with continuing her film career.  You will definitely keep coming back to this one over and over again.  Highly recommended!
B002ZG98UK|5.0|I am a person who before watching a movie i try to know what i going to watch, so i have already seen the another movies of this, and the story kinda suck and even don't follow the storyline from the game, but appart of that it has awesome 3D effects!!! in fact i think this movie its equal of better than the 3D of avatar.    If you have a 3D TV this is a must have in any blu ray  3D collection, the 3D its simply amazing, and i think that this movie will be for a time the best action 3D movie, so just sit down and enjoy this brainless 3D action movie.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Rourke is indeed very good as a aging wrestler disintegrating before<br />our eyes.

B001JNNDDI|4.0|Directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Farris<br />Starring Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Steve Carell, Paul Dano, Toni Collette and Abigail Breslin<br />102 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />Portuguese: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />Little Miss Sunshine was nominated for four Oscars, with Alan Arkin winning for best supporting actor and Michael Arndt taking home the award for best original screenplay. Abigail Breslin was also nominated and the film was included in the best picture category.<br /><br />I listed so many of the cast because this dark comedy is filled with good performances.<br /><br />Olive Hoover (Breslin) qualifies for a beauty pageant which is set to take place 700 miles away. The family includes a heroin addict grandfather (Arkin), an aspiring motivational speaker father (Kinnear), a brother who has taken a vow of silence (Dano), a suicidal uncle (Carell) and a mother who tries to hold everything together (Collette).<br /><br />As several of the family members can't be trusted to survive alone, the entire family decides to make the trip in their old Volkswagen van.<br /><br />The comedy isn't dumb, despite the highly unlikely and sometimes unbelievable situations. The story is mainly driven by dialogue with the exception of a couple of situations.<br /><br />The conclusion shows what happens when they finally arrive in California for the pageant.<br /><br />It's R-rated for language, drug references and references to sex. Perhaps the most offensive thing was seeing how little girls are presented as women in the pageant. It's just a grotesque world.<br /><br />It's not easy to make me laugh and I am typically wary of any movie involving Carell, but this style of humor worked for me. Nobody put in a bad performance and I did laugh out loud a couple of times. I enjoyed every minute.<br /><br />The presentation was excellent for such a low budget movie. Picture quality was good throughout and deserves a 4.5/5. Audio did the job and dialogue was clear (4/5).<br /><br />I would recommend this intelligent comedy to anyone who doesn't need to be bullied into laughter with slapstick.<br /><br />This is the type of story that has plenty of replay value as it will be fun to revisit these people and spend a while in their dysfunctional lives. For those wondering whether it's worth upgrading to the Blu-ray, I heartily recommend this presentation.as excellent for such a low budget movie.

B0047Y17P2|1.0|After the complexities of Harry Bosch novels, these lawyer series (Mickey Haller) are just drawn out legal wrangling and boring.  My guess is the author just got tired of working hard and took the easy way out.  I would not buy any book unless it is Harry Bosch.
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I'll admit I watched this in part because of the gorgeous European scenery. I wasn't disappointed. The movie goes from Paris to Italy and the scenes are so beautiful. I was entertained throughout the flick and when it finished my family agreed that it was a \\"cute enough film\\" meaning that it had: action, romance, a decent story, and really good acting. I'm not usually a Johnny Depp fan but I did like him in this. My family enjoyed this, and I think you will as well.
B0014BQQYS|4.0|Directed by George Roy Hill<br />Starring Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross<br />110 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-2<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Original aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital Mono<br />French: Dolby Digital Mono<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital Mono<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Korean<br /><br />***Spoilers within***<br /><br />I don't like westerns, but this isn't a traditional western.<br /><br />The film has a stylized look featuring photographs and a sepia tinge in many of the scenes to remind us that we are looking at an old story. I didn't care for it, but I understand why the choice was made.<br /><br />I remember seeing the film in the early 70s on TV. Our newspaper's film critic had a ratings system consisting of excellent, very good, good, average and poor. He invented a new rating just for this movie: marvelous. I have no idea why I remember that.<br /><br />The movie won four Oscars:<br /><br />Cinematography - Conrad L. Hall (Cool Hand Luke, American Beauty, Road to Perdition, Marathon Man)<br />This was deserved. Some of the chase scenes were spectacular.<br /><br />Original Song - Burt Bacharach/Hal David<br />Raindrops is certainly memorable, but I don't think it fit the feel of the movie and shouldn't have been included.<br /><br />Score - Burt Bacharach<br />Good overall, but could have done without raindrops and some of the music used during the montage scenes.<br /><br />Screenplay - William Goldman (Heat, Princess Bride, Marathon Man, Absolute Power, Misery)<br />Thoroughly deserved. The dialogue carried the movie and Goldman knew when to shut up.<br /><br />I loved the movie as a child. I'm not quite sure why. I remember that my grandparents loved it too. Newman and Redford work well together and there's a lot of clever humor.<br /><br />Watching it as an adult who has only started to analyze films in the past three years, I noticed a few more things:<br /><br />It avoids most of the cliches that westerns rely on. For instance, Sundance was accused of cheating while playing cards. In every other western, there would have been a shootout with the accuser dying. In this, it's used as a plot point to show us how good Sundance is and there isn't a need for anyone to be shot.<br /><br />The chase scene is my favorite part of the movie. In particular, I like how sparse the dialogue is during this extended sequence. We see everything unfold and hear the horses galloping, but dialogue is only present when it has to be. It reminds me of No Country For Old Men somewhat. The sounds are a part of the story and it works well. The cinematography during this sequence is exceptional.<br /><br />It's surprising how little we see of the Hole in the Wall gang. We meet them and see two robberies, but that's all. It shows that Butch survived more on his wits than any ability to fight. When he's challenged, he cheats.<br /><br />The scene with the dynamite leads to probably the funniest line in the film.<br /><br />The story relies on the chemistry between Newman and Redford. We like them and root for them even though they are technically the villains. Redford in particular says a huge amount without actually opening his mouth. His expressions clearly convey what he's thinking. The friendship between the two is obvious in everything they do and say while facing their trackers. Katharine Ross also has an important role. When she's flirting with Butch, we learn more about the depth of his friendship with Sundance.<br /><br />The whole tracking scene is a great idea with an collection of the best lawmen available at the time. They clearly demonstrate their expertise by killing members of the Hole in the Wall gang without missing their intended target. The movie then avoids the cliche of them later missing when facing Butch and Sundance. We don't see a shootout with our heroes winning. They are up against superior odds and are lucky to get away. That was a good choice.<br /><br />The trip to Bolivia was quite well done too and their subsequent crime spree. I like the attention to detail. The language was a barrier and was dealt with properly. In the final scene, we are shown a real problem when Butch and Sundance run out of ammunition. Again they face overwhelming odds. On first viewing, I expected them to escape. But the choice to show what happens in the face of overwhelming odds was the correct one.<br /><br />The final shot was a good way to end the story and makes me think of The 400 Blows as it ends with a still.<br /><br />I still don't like westerns in general, but I have always liked this movie. It's carried by the charisma of two wonderful actors of the time and brings back a lot of good memories for me.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is weak. The sepia shots look terrible and it looks like a DVD for most of the 110 minutes. The main exception is the final scene which was shot in sunlight and has better detail. A film of this quality deserves better treatment. That said, I would still buy the BD and own the best possible version of the film.<br /><br />The Sundance Festival was named after Robert Redford's character and he was the inaugural chairman with Katharine Ross also on the first jury in 1978.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5was a barrier and was dealt with properly.

B004499LWQ|5.0|Directed by Mike Nicholls<br />Starring Clive Owen, Natalie Portman, Jude Law and Julia Roberts<br />104 minutes<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Italian: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />Italian: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese, Korean, Thai<br /><br />I used to confuse this film with Control (a Joy Division biopic), because Closer is also the name of Joy Division's last studio album.<br /><br />Mike Nichols (The Graduate) was in his 70s when he directed Closer and times have changed a lot since the days of The Graduate (1967). Both are excellent films though, despite the change.<br /><br />What elevates Closer from the pack is the writing. Patrick Marber wrote the play and also adapted the screenplay. If you have ever seen a TV series starring Steve Coogan, Marber probably wrote it. He has a talent for writing comedy and it's the type of comedy I like. That said, Closer is not a comedy; it's a drama with plenty of humor in it.<br /><br />Good actors can't really succeed without good writing, but this has both. All four do good work here. It has the feel of a Woody Allen film in some ways and also reminds me of Glengarry Glen Ross as both were adapted from plays. The dialogue comes at you at a fast pace and the actors play off one another well. Some conversations are a joy to experience.<br /><br />Both men sleep with both women (not at the same time) and the story deals with the relationships in an amusing way. The main point of the film is to show how much people lie to one another. Even when they think they are speaking absolute truth, it often turns out to be a lie. Are they saying these things to convince themselves of their good intentions? Are lies preferable to truth in some instances?<br /><br />The 104 minutes seem to pass very quickly. I was caught up in the story and the lives of these four people. It's more a romantic drama than a romantic comedy, despite the witty lines that appear throughout the story.<br /><br />I'm not sure which character I liked the most. They all have redeeming qualities. It's just a fun thing to experience and the writing is smart. I think the actors enjoyed delivering this wonderful dialogue. Owen and Portman received Oscar nominations for their performances.<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5a romantic drama than a romantic comedy, despite the witty lines that appear throughout the story.

0385737955|3.0|Definitely a page turner, but forcibly so. It's one of those where the wool felt pulled over the eyes, where certain questions should have been answered early on, but weren't for the purpose of creating intrigue. In and of itself, not too bothersome, but when coupled with the payoff (i.e., the plot reveal/purpose of the maze), it became a bit harder to swallow. Great dystopian, IMO, has a strong correlation to reality... perhaps not completely real, but not veiled in mystery to cover the implausibility.    Not that The Hunger Games or the like is in the realm of reality (that would be THE ROAD, or closer to SHIP BREAKER in the YA genre), but this went a bit too far off the deep end.     Overall, not the best written (in terms of plotting, style, characterization), but a definite page turner.

He started that job because he loved the music of Joy Division which led to his first proper film in 2007, Control. It dealt with the life of lead singer Ian Curtis. This is his first feature that has nothing to do with music.<br /><br />It's not what the average viewer would expect.<br /><br />The American is about Jack (Clooney), who kills people for a living. In the first few minutes, we see him in action as people try to kill him in Sweden. He relocates to Italy for what he says will be his last job.<br /><br />One of Jack's \\"weaknesses\\" is that he forms friendships instead of staying aloof while he is working on a hit.<br /><br />This is not an action movie. There are two or three brief action sequences, but that's not the point of this movie. If you're looking for another Bourne movie or Taken, look elsewhere. The American is a more contemplative look at the life of a killer. We see extended sequences with no dialogue and Clooney is shown thinking. We see his paranoia and get an idea of what it would be like to be in his shoes.<br /><br />Despite the warnings of his boss, Jack makes friends in Italy. Will they lead to his eventual death?<br /><br />This movie will undoubtedly be too slow for the majority of viewers. I found it refreshing. It's intelligent for the most part and I was drawn in to the story. One of the things I liked about it was that Clooney didn't rely on his smirk and charm routine. He played this one seriously and it was the better for it.<br /><br />The ending is deliberately ambiguous. Does Jack live or die? We can't be sure.<br /><br />The cinematography is excellent. The beauty of the Italian mountains is shown frequently. The picture quality is also good, making the panoramic shots very effective.<br /><br />This Blu-ray presentation is recommended for fans of the film, or people that enjoy slow-paced stories that require a bit of thought to fully appreciate.'t be sure.

The content is not new as i now bout the running he suggests and also lifting weights to fail u can learn this stuff doin basic personal training courses...but he puts it all into 1 place where u can refer to it easily...for ppl to say it wasnt worth the $20-$30 is a joke stop being such a bunch of tight arses,there are heaps of other books i paid more for that where a waste but i didnt piss n moan about them...  Yes i liked the book and for the diet alone was worth the money...and as to say u cannot stay on it for a long time is not true,if anything this diet teaches u about the food we put into our bodies,god knows there are so many ppl that need the education,our world is losing the fight against weight...so y not try it...u have probably tried everything else and it not worked...this diet does work whatever u wanta call it...paleo,atkins with a cheat, scd just try it!!!  As for tims constant references to himself all the time well its just the way he writes i guess but he could have left a lot of them out..the sex stuff was outta place,and really is not useful at all...really the book should have been approx 250-300 pages only!!!
B0043XQ1TE|4.0|Alt, or a musician is part of his life may be due to health problems, but most visitors Deerhunter problems involving life in their music. Pop Star as saying that sex is interesting.    Deerhunter advantage is that you can sing a lot more drugs, and serial connection, or that music is optimistic about overcoming the world. Feeling okay about making Deerhunter (late, lamented) Grandaddy, at least in this band writes songs that really says a lot about different things.

Of course, this \\"Mac\\" and the type of meeting, and this may be that Cox has the music more than 3 years or more seemingly normal or possible. Highlights of the team seems to really be happy. I really like half of his music collection. In terms of what I would choose the hard \\"Memory Boy\\" is breathtaking. The most interesting songs, one hit wonders. These songs are often hard edge \\"Boy\\" Memory is very complex, and very small things. He just kind of talk. In his life.    Of course, \\"bat\\", the source of this music is very cool. I can not share information in a song Do songs so I do not know if it works as a musical    natural person associated with \\"Do not cry,\\" It's for old songs sounds more like Deerhunter can take something very easy to give great importance.

B002ZG99NG|4.0|Directed by Ben Affleck<br />Starring Ben Affleck, Rebecca Hall and Jeremy Renner<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />This is a review of the 153-minute extended cut. The theatrical 125-minute version is also included in this Blu-ray presentation.<br /><br />The movie opens with a robbery, but this is not a heist movie. We don't see how it's planned and we don't know who is involved. It's about the consequences of those actions.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall plays a bank employee who is taken as a hostage. The robbers get away and release her. I'm saying this without spoilers as it happens at the start of the movie and establishes what is to form the main body of the story.<br /><br />Affleck is one of the robbers. He checks on Hall to make sure she isn't going to turn them in. They start a relationship.<br /><br />Renner plays a psycho who loves the power that he gets from being part of the robbery. He wants to kill Hall's character to be safe.<br /><br />The story is essentially about how the situation is resolved. Who lives, who dies, who gets caught and who escapes. How they see their future.<br /><br />It's set in Boston in Charlestown, an area of one square mile where it's almost a way of life to commit crimes of this nature. The FBI wants to stop it happening.<br /><br />This is elevated above many movies of this type. There's a lot of time spent on the characters. How they were brought up and why they do what they do now. It's also about change, or the potential for change. The problems of going through such a transition.<br /><br />Hall is excellent. I enjoyed her role in Vicky Cristina Barcelona and this performance is just as good. She seems real in this role. Affleck isn't bad either and this stays well within his range. There's also a welcome cameo from Chris Cooper.<br /><br />The story was better than I expected. I felt like I was there and a part of what was happening.<br /><br />It does have limitations and takes a long time to give us quite a small amount of information. I will watch it again though. There's very little action, but it fits in well when it happens. The theatrical cut has better pacing and is a better option if your friends prefer action over characterization.and takes a long time to give us quite a small amount of information.

B004DK5CW4|5.0|Although I've never been fond of Thoroughbreds (I prefer ranch-type horses myself), I have been waiting for this movie to come out on DVD because Secretariat was a great horse - the greatest of his time.    John Malkovich was a surprise - I never thought he'd be good in that type of role, but the performance was great.      I would have liked to have seen footage of the different horses used to play \\"Big Red\\", though... I know they used several in Hidalgo and Seabiscuit, so I'd love to see the ones they used in Secretariat - but alas, it was not included in Special Features.    Over all, a great movie about a great horse, and I'm sure all horse folks will enjoy it. Acting was great, not too much schmaltz.    Lastly - my late husband was in KY and got to see Big Red win the Kentucky Derby.  I've always been a bit envious.  He's passed away now.
0060920432|5.0|This is a great book on a psychology phenomenon known as Flow. Have you ever been working or doing some activity and lost track of time because you were so immersed in the activity? That is flow. This book examines the phenomenon and helps you develop methods for bringing it about intentionally. A side note: I have worked at a place that expressly wanted you to avoid doing this despite the fact that it improves job performance, increases job satisfaction and a few other perks that I cannot recall presently. Of course, that place was completely backwards anyway.
B001992NW4|4.0|The Exorcist<br />Cast: Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, Max von Sydow, Lee J. Cobb<br />Director: William Friedkin<br />Warner Brothers   1973   132m and 122m   Rated R  <br /><br />Video:<br />VC-1   1080p   1.78:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English DTS-HD Master Audio 6.1<br />English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish: Dolby Digital Mono<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Arabic, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, French, German SDH, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian SDH, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish<br /><br />Discs:<br />Two 50GB Blu-ray Discs<br />Digibook<br /><br />The Exorcist's iconic cover claims that it's the scariest film of all time, but the makers of the movie prefer to label it as a theological thriller. I tend to agree and have always considered The Silence of the Lambs, The Shining and Psycho as psychological thrillers rather than horror. I mention those three because they represent the best that 'horror' has to offer, whether you label them as such or not.<br /><br />If you have read my other reviews, you'll know by now that I'm a movie snob. When I think of horror films, the first thing that comes to mind is excessive gore and cheesy lines. I'm simply not a fan of seeing bodies hacked to pieces and I don't find any value in cheesy horror stories. So bear that in mind if you are a fan of such movies as the Evil Dead (not that there's anything wrong with that).<br /><br />Instead, I look at how films are made, what they make me feel, the quality of the acting and the methods used by the director. In those terms, The Exorcist deserves to be rated among the best 'horror' films ever made.<br /><br />The film plays like a book with the three main sets of characters being shown individually before the threads are drawn together for the body of the story. The story begins with Father Merrin (Max von Sydow) heading an archeological expedition in Iraq. Father Karras (Jason Miller) is shown caring for his dying mother and we are shown how he lives. Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is shown being a mother to Regan (Linda Blair).<br /><br />Regan is a pretty, playful 12-year-old girl without a care in the world. We see her demeanor gradually change as she's possessed by a demon. She seeks out her mother's bed because her own is shaking, but her mother thinks she's lying. There are noises in the attic which are thought to be rats as Chris tries to label them as something familiar. Regan's sweet nature gradually erodes and we see her lose her temper more and more frequently. She's eventually referred to doctors and shouts obscenities at them. Some of the tests she has to undergo would be frightening to a child, but everything comes back negative. A psychiatrist gets a turn and also fails to solve the problem. Denial is a powerful thing in this story as doctors continually try to rationalize the things they are seeing and hearing.<br /><br />Chris is an atheist, but can see that the doctors are wrong. She eventually seeks out help from Father Karras, showing just how desperate she is to help her daughter. If you allow yourself to be drawn in to the story and consider how you would react if your own child underwent such changes, you'll feel the power of this film.<br /><br />The climax of the film sees Father Karras and Father Merrin performing an exorcism after convincing the church that it was needed. Regan's transformation is impressive. When possessed, she talks in many different voices, some of which are known to the priests and the people around her. The demon is a master liar and seeks to confuse the priests and prevent the exorcism. Regan becomes a monster, reeling off obscenities and spewing foul green bile. Her face and body become covered in scars and it's hard to see anything of the original person.<br /><br />In 1973, it was a real challenge to produce some of the effects seen in the film.Instead of CGI, everything had to be done by other means. Wires were used in two or three of the scenes were Regan levitates or runs down the stairs upside down. A model was made to enable the illusion that her head turns 360 degrees. The bile had to be made and then delivered using tubes. Although it's obvious that the spinning head is a model, it's still unsettling to see it happen.<br /><br />Will you be scared by this movie? Visually, it's nothing compared to effects achieved by modern techniques. You might be scared if the story captures you sufficiently to make you feel that you're a part of it. Imagine yourself as Regan's parent for example. We can overlook the dated effects and take them seriously because everything else about this film is deadly serious. The acting is strong throughout, with the whole cast performing well. Friedkin tells the story simply, but effectively. The final solution is extreme, but convincing.<br /><br />Like Psycho, this film was original and startling in its day. It has an important place in film history. It might not have a strong impact on people who are used to modern horror movies, but it's worth seeing for anyone who has avoided it thus far.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5:<br /><br />This package includes two discs. One shows the original theatrical version (122m) and the other shows the extended version (132m). My comments refer to the extended version, although I would expect the quality to be identical in both versions.<br /><br />The scenes in Iraq are bright and full of detail and the film would earn a 4.5 for picture quality if it were that good throughout. Unfortunately, much of the film is shot in dimly lit rooms and grain is dense in such scenes. All things considered, it's hard to imagine the image looking any better than it does though.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5:<br /><br />Friedkin mentions that the lossless audio enables him to hear effects that he had forgotten were in the film. It's certainly a strong presentation and the film benefits most of all from the audio upgrade. We can clearly hear Regan wheezing and the voices in outdoor scenes come across well in the rear speakers. Dialogue is always easy to understand and some of the louder scenes, such as furniture moving or glass breaking, carry added weight. The 6.1 version is included in the extended cut, while the original version has 5.1 audio.<br /><br />Special Features 4.5/5:<br /><br />There's plenty of background information included in the special features for anyone who is interested.<br /><br />Director's commentary<br />Raising Hell: Filming the Exorcist (30m, HD)<br />The Exorcist Locations: Georgetown Then and Now (9m, HD)<br />Faces of Evil: The Different Versions of the Exorcist (10m, HD)<br />Trailers, TV Spots and Radio Spots<br />Director's Introduction (2m, SD)<br />The Fear of God (77m, SD)<br />Filmmaker Interviews (9m, SD)<br />Sketches and Storyboards (3m, SD)<br />Original Ending (2m, SD)<br />40-page booklet with pictures, cast details and background information<br /><br />The Exorcist is an important part of cinematic history.

B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I happened to catch an episode of Sons of Anarchy on FX one night while channel surfing with my husband. It was from season two, and got me so intrigued I ordered season one. It sucked us in from the first episode and we spent an entire weekend watching every episode of the show. The characters are well developed and suck you in from the beginning. When I heard Katie Segal (peg from Married With Children) I was skeptical as to how she would pull it off. She is BRILLIANT!!! She is incredibly believable and although she is harsh you can't help but love her and cheer her on, illegal activities and all. This is a show that essentially gets you rooting for \\"the bad guys\\" and loving every minute of it. Don't be surprised if you have the urge to go buy a Harley and hit the open road. This is now our favorite show by far and we eagerly await season 4.

B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I'm not the kind of guy who likes to plop down 12.99 for an ebook, but this one I had to have. And I wasn't disappointed! Tina Fey may be the funniest comedy writer alive, and her memoir is filled with the kind of zingers that make 30 Rock a consistently funny show. While covering plenty of ground about her personal life and funny or poignant memories, this is not a tell-all; no celebrities were harmed in the making of this book. I was delighted to learn more about this smart, clever woman and I laughed plenty along the way. In spite of the mean things people say and have said about Ms. Fey, I hope she knows how much joy she has brought into people's lives with her work, this book included.

It's certainly one of his most influential.<br /><br />The marketing for the movie was clever and audiences were refused admission after the show had started. Hitchcock wanted them to experience the story from start to finish. He also urged people that had seen it to avoid spoiling it for others. I mention that because I don't want to spoil the experience for you. It's 50 years old, so the following comments contain spoilers and assume that you have seen the movie. If you haven't, please stop reading now and remedy the situation as soon as possible.<br /><br />Psycho might seem a bit tame by today's standards. It was shot in black and white to lessen the impact of seeing the blood. The murders appeared brutal through the clever cuts and camera angles rather than explicitly showing flesh being cut. As with all of Hitchcock's work, what you imagine in your own mind is more frightening than what you see on the screen. To truly appreciate the impact of the movie, imagine what had gone before when this was originally released.<br /><br />Without Psycho, we may never have seen franchises like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Saw. But unlike some of those mentioned, Psycho isn't remotely humorous. The reason is that Norman Bates, or someone like him, could exist. That's the most frightening thing about the movie. Compare it to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker for instance. The Dark Knight is elevated above every other superhero movie because it could happen.<br /><br />Hitchcock uses misdirection effectively by opening the movie as if it is a romance. Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, meets her lover and the audience assumes that she is the focus of the story. We see her steal the money and flee the city. The camera hints at her thought processes without the use of narration or dialogue, and we see her nervous reaction to harmless encounters. It's a fascinating look at how people change under stress.<br /><br />Crane eventually needs to stop for the night and we are introduced to Norman Bates and the Bates motel. The story still focuses on Crane's character, but changes dramatically after Bates attacks her in the infamous shower scene. This is usually the first scene that comes to mind when thinking about Psycho, and it's a shame in a way. The movie is so much more than a simple murder.<br /><br />The plot switches as people start to wonder what happened to Crane, leading to a second murder. We then realize that Norman Bates is the true focus of the story. He's brilliantly portrayed by Anthony Perkins and appears familiar when we first meet him. He's shy around women and outwardly calm, but he's clearly nervous when under pressure.<br /><br />Until the revelations near the end, Hitchcock cleverly lets us think that the mother exists. In a way I suppose she does. This is a sad story and Bates becomes a character we can pity. If you think things through from his point of view, his actions make sense. Wouldn't you cover up a crime committed by someone you love? There many layers to the story and several different ways to appreciate it.<br /><br />The initial setup uses well-established Hitchcock techniques and themes. He misdirects us and uses suspense. The initial focus of the story, Marion Crane, is a woman on the run. Because she's in that situation, she becomes more interesting to us. The $40,000 she steals is a MacGuffin that serves no purpose other thanto give Crane's character a reason for her actions.<br /><br />Everything flows smoothly and the pacing is effective. It's hard to be bored even for a second. The term masterpiece is overused, but Psycho qualifies.<br /><br />Video Quality:<br /><br />The universal VC-1 transfer is region free and very pleasing.

1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr has compiled an owners manual for the human being. In her entertaining and engaging voice, she explains what to do and why in lay terms. Topics range from meditation and bathing to exercise and diet. Unlike many diet books that dictate a single one-size-fits-all course of action, Carr encourages her reader to listen to the body and make changes as the reader feels able to make them, a practice which is more likely to lead to a lasting alteration in habits.   Like many of us who've fought weight, I've read a lot of diet books. I typically read them and then, having gleaned the core ideas, sell them at a local book store. I'll be hanging on to this one. Carr's voice is so inspiring and her plan so adjustable, I know that when I 'fall off the wagon' I'll be motivated to get back on track just by rereading some of her text.
B00003CXBK|5.0|A two-hour visual smorgasbord - there isn't much here that wouldn't look just fine framed and hanging on a gallery wall.  It is a complex and very nuanced plot, and one is grateful for Miyazaki avoiding the usual Manichean sanctimony of cartoon eco-propaganda in favor of characters who all seem to have more or less credible motivations for their actions.  They can be faulted for stupidity, but seldom for evil.    For once the English voice-overs capture the essence of the original but I still preferred it in Japanese with subtitles (I'm not fluent in Japanese but understand enough to notice that neither the voice-overs nor the subtitles are precise).  The voice acting in the original, the music, the pacing, the scenery, are possibly the best in the genre.  This is far, far superior to anything Disney has ever done.      There are some cultural references that are not necessary to understand what's going on but enrich the emotional impact of the film considerably.  When Ashitaka cuts his hair, for example, it means that he is leaving his home never to return.  Sumo wrestlers have a similar ceremony when they retire.  When his little sister, one of the people for whom he incurred the curse in protecting, gives him her dagger afterward she knows she'll never see him again.      It's a very Japanese treatment in other ways.  The underlying motivation of all of the main characters is loyalty: to family, to clan, to species, to uchi - this is \\"home\\" in Japanese but means a great deal more.  Ashitaka has had to give his up, which provides a tragic flavor to his character that is not resolved by an ending that brilliantly avoids closure.  Will he find it once more, either in Irontown or with the woman he loves?  We do not know, but there is hope.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|We loved this Les Miserables.  Wonderful singing (perhaps with the exceptions of Marius and Cossette).  Superb orchestra and chorus.  Fine Costumes.<br />What struck me was the way the characters, the values, and the situations assumed their archetypical dimensions.  The stylized, unrealistic presentation; the posing, rather than acting (except the innkeeper couple); the way characters died by closing their eyes and walking out of the spotlight -- all of these worked to show that the characters were not particularly individuals, but were types, types who are always among us.  The clash of values is equally archetypical: the greed for gain of the innkeepers who reappear in different guises -- reminds me of Milo Minderbinder in Catch 22; the vengeful anger of the early Valjean, and of the whoremonger; the selfless love of the bishop, of the converted Valjean and Marius' friend; and the rigid, unyielding sense of justice without love of Jouvert.  All of these values are ALWAYS clashing, competing for our loyalty.<br />Only a genius of Victor Hugo's caliber could present these archetypes in such an appealing, compelling story.  But this production does justice to the archetypes.  Indeed, it goes far beyong merely doing justice.  At the \\"end\\" of the show, the composers, the great librettist, and the producer came out to join the cast after the curtain calls.  This sense of Les Miserables just running perpetually through human time was enhanced, first by cast members from earlier productions coming out and singing numbers from the show, then by young persons who will be in future productions coming down the aisle singing.<br />The whole thing was at least as much a celebration as a show.  Love wins, Justice -- self-convicted -- loses.<br />Years ago I saw another Les Miserables which put me in touch of the eternal archetypes in Hugo's masterpiece.  It is the French film by Claude LeLouch, starring Jean-Paul Belmondo as two incarnations of Valjean.  This is great art!

Detail is murky in places and the image is overly scrubbed. Probably 3/5.<br /><br />The reason I like it is the writing. Tarantino's dialogue has a distinct feel. You either like it or you don't. I find it very funny and I love it. He wasn't at his peak here, but was establishing his voice still. There are excellent moments and some not so good.<br /><br />Slater does pretty well as Clarence. Arquette's Alabama is an essential character and their relationship works.<br /><br />The best scene in the movie is where Christopher Walken's character interrogates Hopper's. Just brilliant writing.<br /><br />It's full of star power with big name actors playing tiny roles. It's very violent in the way of a Tarantino movie. The basic plot is very simple and could be summarized in a single paragraph, but this is more about the journey.<br /><br />Humor, a Mexican standoff, blood, bizarre dialogue, it's all there.<br /><br />Not in the same league as Pulp Fiction, but it felt more like a Tarantino movie than a Scott movie.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|Fight Club: A Knockout Satire    The first rule of Fight Club is \\"You do not talk about Fight Club\\". For a film that depicts its characters breaking all the rules, we will ignore this statute and delve into a world where punching someone in the face is considered a favor and nothing is as it seems. Released in 1999 by director by David Fincher, Fight Club is a film adaptation by the novel of the same name, written by Chuck Palahniuk. Having read this novel, it is not very often I get to say, the movie is much better than the book, due primarily to the superb acting and interesting cinematic techniques, which completely, yet pleasantly, surprised me. With a heavyweight class including Edward Norton (American History X, 25th Hour), Brad Pitt (Se7en, Inglorious Basterds) and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech, Big Fish), Fight Club is sure to deliver a lethal unexpected right hook sure to knock you on your ass.   The film focuses on two men, an uptight insomniac yuppie (Norton) trying to hit rock bottom in life and a carefree soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Pitt), who attempts to make Norton's character reevaluate his values and priorities. Through a new form a therapy that includes viscously brawling with strangers, the values of our society are addressed. Eventually this testosterone-fueled violent therapy evolves into something truly sinister yet celebrated amongst this underground men's club. This whole plot is tied together by the relationship between the two main characters, their opposing views on a unique woman in their life, Marla (Bonham Carter), and the disintegration of a once-promising life.    If you think that this movie is simply another senseless violent movie like Fighting or any other teen angst movie where the main star has to fight a bully for a better life, I urge you to think again. Unique cinematographic techniques and at times a nonlinear story line, part of the original Palahniuk novel, it leaves the viewer somewhat disoriented and detached from reality, which ties in perfectly with the feelings of the characters. Addressing the state of the United States, and most industrialized nations, in its consumerist state, far past the necessary components of life, the film makes the viewer ask themselves what they truly need in life instead of \\"What sort of dining set defines me as a person?\\" The film satirizes the world of consumers and culminates with a big bang, fittingly set to the song \\"Where is My Mind\\" by the Pixies, sure to leave viewers awestruck. This idea of consumerism taking over is something that most, if not all, of us can relate to.    I would not recommend this movie to anyone with self-esteem issues, which repeatedly informs the Fight Club participants, as well as the viewer that \\"they are not a special unique snowflake\\". That, paired with images of Brad Pitt fighting shirtless is enough to make any self-respecting person's positive self-regard waver. Also if anyone is a fan of Martha Stewart steer clear because let's just say Tyler Durden does not think too highly of her, and lets the viewer know this in a scene with some very colorful language. The film is rated R, because of scenes like this, for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language. There is possibly no better way to summarize the film more quickly than the rating of \\"violent anti social behavior.\\" The film is filled with ultra-violent realistic fight scenes; though they are very bloody at times, they serve a purpose and propel the story forward, instead of other films in similar categories where the idea of the film is simply violence for violence's sake. This film is something much more than that.   For those who have never been in a fight, those who do not want to die without any scars or anyone who has recently developed insomnia based upon an unfulfilled lifestyle dedicated to collecting various consumer goods, I truly recommend this film. A fast paced film that hits you and hits you nonstop and does not quit until the end when you are forced to tap out, question your beliefs and values and, experience premature enlightenment, Fight Club is a truly remarkable and unique film. The film can change your entire idea about the life you lead. It makes you question yourself and more specifically who, if given the option, you would fight. Gandhi, Lincoln, William Shatner; in the world of Fight Club everyone is a potential opponent and nothing is out of bounds, so long as there are no shoes and no shirts.

Nobody stood out though. The story itself was pretty standard fare with nothing to distinguish it from the pack.<br /><br />I didn't find myself laughing or emotionally moved, apart from one scene when Bening was talking about music. As someone who understands why music is hugely important in my life, I connected with what she was saying and portraying.<br /><br />The story revolves around a family which has two mothers (Bening and Moore). When their biological father (Ruffalo) is contacted by one of the two kids, he starts to become involved in their lives.<br /><br />It's a puzzle to me how this is among the 10 best picture nominees. It's slightly above average with decent acting. The story is nothing special. I wasn't sitting on the edge of my seat hoping for something and I never felt connected with the characters apart from the scene I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />Worth seeing, but don't rush out to buy it.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation is pleasing and I would recommend it to any fan of the movie.<br /><br />Overall 3.5/5

030746363X|4.0|Well, I can't say much, having only started using the $HB system. Already I am seeing progress. The Slow-carb diet is easy after the first week, and really helps regulate insulin (as A diabetic, i really appreciate this.)    Some people say you can't get the results Tim suggests in the way he suggests. Well, I am only a few weeks in, and I have lost an inch on my waist and about 6 lbs - and I drink too much diet soda, so i am not following it exactly. Also, i haven't started supplements yet.     it's not contradictory. the section on Fat loss has different information than the great sex section, but so what? Different goals require different behaviors.    I have tried many diets, many fad workouts, and this is the first time I see sustainable and inexpensive food preparation. i spend about 40 dollars a week and I am a big eater.     Oh, one think Tim does get wrong. Lentils. He gets them canned because he doesn't like to cook them. They literally take 30 minutes for a giant pot that lasts me a day and a half (with chicken added). Maybe tim is too busy to take the time, but i am not. And they are really delicious. the red have the best texture but are lower in Dietary fiber (Generally).    On a side note: first, notice I am still in \\"fat loss\\" mode. however, thanks to his restrictions, I am starting to take great interest in red wines.     Also, if you go the lentil route, drink plenty of water.    It's not a fad, it's science.
B000YKE87W|3.0|I cannot fathom this singer's popularity.  After 70 years of listening to opera recordings, I have never before encountered a voice which has all the other requisites and essentials for singing opera but which also is so uninteresting and unexciting in basic quality.  The voice is heavy, dark and unrelentingly colorless and monochromatic, deficient in brilliance or brightness or without thrilling tenor overtones.  I find it tiring to listen to any track here and find my mind wondering.  To my ears his voice is different but uninteresting and even often unattractive.
B001BJ690Y|5.0|Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (Action, Crime)<br />Directed by Quentin Tarantino<br />Starring Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu and Daryl Hannah<br /><br />Disney / Buena Vista   2003   111 min   Rated R   Released Sep 09, 2008<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: LPCM 5.1 (48kHz, 16-bit)<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Cantonese, Korean, Japanese, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray Disc<br /><br />The Film 5/5<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Chungking Express and remember reading that Quentin Tarantino cries when he watches it because he loves it so much. That's how I feel when I watch the two Kill Bill movies. Within three minutes, I hear Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down) and I'm transported into another world. It reminds me of what I'm in for. Every choice that Tarantino makes, from story, to dialogue and music, is absolutely perfect. I feel like he made this film with me in mind.<br /><br />Uma Thurman was born to play the role of The Bride. I'm still not sure how she managed to keep a straight face as she spoke the dialogue.<br /><br />It took me five years to bother seeing Kill Bill because I don't embrace things with senseless violence. The movie suggests extreme violence, but shows hardly any of it, just the result. The cuts are convincing and have the same effect as if you had seen the violent acts. I expected Thurman to prance around with a samurai sword, hacking people to pieces. In fact, she pretty much does, but there's so much more to the story.<br /><br />First of all, she makes me care. Her back story makes her actions seem justified, but I also feel pity for O-Ren Ishii (Liu) when we see what happened to her when she was a child (brilliantly portrayed anime style). The film uses a number of tricks such as stills, black and white, slow motion, silhouettes, changing aspect ratios, and extreme close-ups. The pacing, humor, drama and action all seem to be woven together perfectly.<br /><br />Kill Bill is a simple story of revenge. We learn in the opening scene that The Bride was shot in the head at her wedding rehearsal and spent four years in a coma as a result. The story isn't linear, so the first person we see her kill is actually second on her Death List. Although it reveals that she successfully killed O-Ren Ishii by showing a line through her name, none of the tension is lost when we are shown their epic battle.<br /><br />We see The Bride recover from her coma and visit Japan in search of O-Ren Ishii. There's a great scene involving Sonny Chiba and we eventually see The Bride hunt down O-Ren Ishii and her minions. The showdown is approximately an hour long and it's intense. Thurman looks like she can handle a sword and stunt double Zoe Bell handles the more difficult scenes.<br /><br />It's hard to think about the film without using the word perfect. The battle involves dozens of fighters as The Bride hacks her way through the obstacles standing between her and O-Ren Ishii. The contrast between those scenes and the final fight is stunning. Instead of being surrounded by a noisy mob, The Bride and O-Ren fight in a quiet setting. It's a very effective transition.<br /><br />I always watch Kill Bill Vol. 2 after seeing Vol. 1 and think of it as one long film. If you think that the characters feel incomplete, the concluding volume fleshes them out and makes them seem a lot more real. This first installment contains most of the action and fans of that genre should be happy with the result.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Kill Bill Vol. 1 looks fantastic on Blu-ray, even though it was released in 2008. Detail is strong throughout, whether the image is in color or black and white. Colors are rich and accurate and black levels won't disappoint. I detected slight aliasing in one scene, but the overall presentation makes the film one of the best-looking live action films yet released on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The lossless English: LPCM 5.1 mix matches the excellent video quality. There's a lot going on and it's all separated well and presented accurately. Whether it's the sound of swords clashing during the intense battle scenes, dialogue, feet crunching on cereal, or Daryl Hannah whistling the theme from Twisted Nerve, you'll hear everything clearly.<br /><br />Special Features 2/5<br /><br />The extras are all presented in standard definition:<br /><br />The Making of Kill Bill (22 minutes) - A decent feature with Tarantino and some of the cast and crew.<br /><br />The 5, 6, 7, 8s Musical Performances (6 minutes) - Two songs from the band featured in the film.<br /><br />Trailers - Six trailers for Tarantino's films.<br /><br />As I said at the start of this review, Kill Bill is so good that I'm close to tears within three minutes.

1427209758|5.0|I don't read a lot of this kind of fiction and the descriptions seemed like a D&D fantasy kind of thing so I was reluctant to start this (we did the audio CD unabridged). It took my wife and a little time to get into the cadence, language and style jumping forward and back and layering in many characters but it all made sense and was important to the story. We bought this for a 3000 mile road trip by the way.<br /><br />Once into the story we could not stop the CD's! We would even add driving from time to time or stall to give up more time listening as the story was so compelling, the characters were very engaging and you could bond to them and have empathy, hate, or passion about them. In short the story was great, and we are already ordering the next book as we MUST know what happens next.<br /><br />When I read or listen to good stories with depth I find myself creating their world, letting the story line effect my normal life, I find myself using their phrases in conversation, wondering what a character might do in a real life situation , etc. In short I let the story envelope me and my imagination. Not all writers can get me to do that but this one did as well as my wife. Since we bought the CD set we will pass it on to one of our adult children and can't wait to discuss it with them.

B003VJTGLQ|5.0|American Beauty<br />Directed by Sam Mendes<br />Starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Thora Birch, Wes Bentley, Mena Suvari<br /><br />Paramount Pictures   1999   122m   Rated R   Sep 21, 2010<br /><br />Video:<br />MPEG-4 AVC   1080p   2.35:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French, Portuguese, Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 2.0<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />Single 50GB Blu-ray disc, region free<br /><br />American Beauty won five Oscars: Actor in a leading role (Kevin Spacey), cinematography (Conrad L. Hall), best director (Sam Mendes), screenplay (Alan Ball) and best picture (Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks). It's a weird tale told in an unusual way.<br /><br />The film contains nudity, violence, bad language, drug use and smoking, so the R-rating is warranted.<br /><br />We learn during the opening narration that our protagonist, Lester Burnham (Spacey), is going to die. The events leading up to his eventual death are funny, moving, sad and unpredictable. Burnham is a pathetic character entering a mid-life crisis and the film shows how his character changes, as well as the lives of the people around him. There is a significant amount of character development in this story. The choice to use Burnham as a narrator was inspired and adds to the feel of the story.<br /><br />It's not strictly a comedy, but it's full of dark humor that is hard to predict. In short, it's the funniest kind of humor. If you found Fargo or any of Quentin Tarantino's films amusing, you'll probably laugh at this too.<br /><br />Burnham changes his life by becoming more assertive and ceasing to care what other people might think. This catalyst for this rebellion is a meeting with his new neighbor, Ricky Fitts (Wes Bentley) who gets high with him before quitting his job on the spot.<br /><br />One of the most important themes of the film is beauty, as you might guess from the title. What is beauty? How do different people define beauty? The contrast between how the characters view other people is startling in places. Some like what they are told to like and dress how they are told to dress. Others are true individuals and express themselves differently. It's interesting to see. You might even find yourself changing your own opinion of what is beautiful as the events unfold.<br /><br />Another theme is the dysfunctional family. The two main families - the Burnham's and Fitts' - couldn't be more different. The one thing they do have in common is that they are living a lie and mostly playing the roles assigned to them by society. They gradually change throughout the movie and try to bring meaning to their lives. we all do this to some extent in our own lives. Why do you do what you do? What do you really want from life and why? Do you set goals in order to get there, or just let things happen? Burnham tries to make things happen.<br /><br />I'm probably in the minority, but I consider this Spacey's best role. American Beauty just makes my Top 10 of all time and it's largely due to his performance. The supporting cast also does good work. His wife (Annette Bening) deals with Burnham's change in her own way while their daughter (Thora Birch) ignores both parents and lives her own life. Chris Cooper has a small but important role as Mr. Fitts.<br /><br />Mendes has taken a look beneath the surface of the American family. It seems that everyone has secrets and chooses to hide them from almost everybody else. The film has humor, sadness, an air of mystery and considerable tension, despite the revelation of Burnham's impending death in the opening narration.<br /><br />Video Quality 3.5/5<br />The Sapphire Series is off to an inconsistent start. While Braveheart was given an exceptional transfer, Gladiator was not so lucky. There was also an audio problem on Saving Private Ryan. The good news is that Paramount offered a free upgradeto fix the problems. Unfortunately, many people will be disappointed with American Beauty on Blu-ray.<br /><br />There's no question that the picture quality is significantly better than that of the DVD. The problem is it's inconsistent. The majority of the film is plagued by frequent white speckles on the image and occasional print damage. Detail is vastly improved, but the images still look a bit drab and subdued due to the source material. Colors look good throughout and red is boosted in some scenes as Mendes intended.<br /><br />The few scenes involving Ricky's camcorder look terrible. I know that it's due to the source material, but the contrast between those scenes and the main movie is huge.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4.5/5<br />The DTS-HD Master Audio track is a big improvement. Ambient sounds such as rain falling are easy to pick out. Thomas Newman's haunting score sounds impressive and adds to the overall mood of the film. Dialogue is always easy to understand and the louder scenes, such as Burnham rocking out while driving, have considerable punch.

030746363X|5.0|I have never before stuck with a diet nor have I ever been motivated to work out on a consistent basis, but all that has changed after purchasing Mr. Ferriss' fantastic book which has already caused me to reap life and health changing benefits. In February, when I started the Slow-carb diet as detailed in the book, I weighed in at 350lbs. and as a former rugby player was disgusted with my overall physical condition. Since adhering strictly to the diet (including the oh so beautiful cheat days) I have dropped 36 lbs and lost 18.5 total inches off of the sum of the 6 measurement points as outlined in the book. By the way, all of this has so far been done simply by changing my diet and following the facets of the diet wholly. I now feel better, look better, and I am planning on incorporating the exercise section of the book and its Minimum Effective Dose method in order to complete my body transformation. I do not have a bunch of blood test results etc to prove any other health benefits as I am a college student and money is tight, but what I can tell you is that this diet has been life changing for me and after seeing these results I cannot wait to incorporate the next phase of the book into my fitness life. Suffice it to say I would ever so highly recommend this book to anyone who is serious about wanting to improve their lives both physically and emotionally as we all know that how we view ourselves in the mirror often times influences both our attitude and demeanor.

After grossing $1.8 billion worldwide with Titanic, Avatar is closing in on $3 billion. Despite its success, many regard it as unoriginal and simply a blend of several stories we already know. While that's true in some ways, it doesn't mean that it isn't groundbreaking or spectacular in its own right.<br /><br />The trailers didn't impress me at all and I dismissed the hype from people who had seen the movie in theaters. When Avatar earned nine Oscar nominations, winning three, and the Blu-ray was released, it was finally time to see what all the fuss was about. I truly expected to be disappointed, but I was completely wrong.<br /><br />Within 90 seconds, the movie had me in its grasp.<br /><br />We see an interior shot of the ship and meet Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), the main protagonist. Cameron chooses to use Sully as a narrator and it works effectively. The opening shot of the ship looks impressive and gives an idea of the sheer scale of the movie. A minute later, a shot of Pandora orbiting a gas giant increases the impression of size.<br /><br />The first 24 minutes takes time to establish the setting. We meet the main human characters and discover some of their background and the purpose of their mission. Sully is an ex-marine who, despite having lost the use of his legs, is able to use the expensive avatar intended for his dead brother. This shows us that the mining company in the story is cynical and only concerned about the bottom line, money.<br /><br />Sully has no experience with the avatar and no training in the background of the native Na'vi language. He's portrayed as savvy, confident and disrespectful, and we are supposed to like him immediately. After a speech that wouldn't have been out of place in Full Metal Jacket, we learn that Pandora is a dangerous and inhospitable moon and that many will not survive their tour of duty.<br /><br />The initial setup might drag for some, but it held my interest. The exposition is clumsy, but it really doesn't matter. This is a feast for the eyes and ears and you will enjoy it more if you don't stop to analyze it.<br /><br />After 24 minutes, everything changes when Sully, as part of an exploration team, is sent on a mission outside the training complex in his avatar body. The initial shot of the surface is breathtaking, full of detail and color. In fact some of the colors seem totally new to science.<br /><br />Sully's inexperience shows and he is separated from the team by the native animals. That's when the story really begins as we encounter a Na'vi woman in the form of Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), Sully's eventual love interest.<br /><br />The hour following Sully's first trip to the surface is the most original and interesting part of the movie. We are shown Pandora and the Na'vi way of life in an extended training sequence as the tribe decides to study Sully. The creatures and plants he encounters are quite different from things we have seen before. The jungle which they inhabit also has unique features. Just look at some of the night scenes for example.<br /><br />I don't want to ruin the story by revealing too much for the few people who haven't seen Avatar, so let's concentrate on the themes.<br /><br />As the world is introduced to us, we start to shift focus. Instead of viewing it as something to be exploited for its minerals, it becomes a precious thing of beauty. The inhabitants want nothing more than to live and be left alone. It's an effective sequence and most viewers will empathize with the plight of the Na'vi and start to side with them, just as our protagonist does.<br /><br />As I have indicated, the script isn't the most important reason to watch Avatar. Some of the dialogue is silly and you are clearly told which characters you are supposed to like or dislike. But that doesn't mean it's totally without depth and you will see a few of the characters develop and change. Sully is an obvious example, as is Grace (Sigourney Weaver), but take a closer look at Tsu'tey (Laz Alonso). His character interested me and I enjoyed seeing his character gradually change throughout the story. I would have liked to have seen him involved even more.<br /><br />Once we are fully invested in the Na'vi way of life, the events which follow have more meaning. The actions of the military seem like abominations. There are obvious parallels to the way in which the US military is viewed by some. The use of Unobtainium is an obvious reference to oil in today's world. The home tree may even be viewed as the twin towers and the Na'vi represent a race that was exploited on our own world. Cameron isn't afraid to use our modern prejudices to draw us in deeper. There is a strong green message as well and it just seems wrong to destroy the beauty and harm the native population.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Orson Scott Card's Ender Wiggin series and it was interesting to see his theme of everything in the world being connected - from Speaker of the Dead - used in Avatar. It was effective because it heightened the feeling that this world and its people should not be exploited.<br /><br />The final 45 minutes switches to full Hollywood mode. We see non-stop action, explosions, inspirational speeches, death, heroic acts, unlikely outcomes and miraculous escapes. It's full of clich&eacute;, but I found that I didn't actually mind. The reason was that the first half of the story made me care about these characters. I was fully invested.<br /><br />One thing I realized after taking everything in was that Avatar was unique in one very important way:<br /><br />I'm a fan of science fiction in general and love movies such as Blade Runner and Dune. When I watch those movies, or Star Wars, I know that they are set in different realities and sometimes on different worlds. But part of me always thinks that it's just Earth. It may feature a desert setting or use an unusual location, but it's still something I know. Avatar made me feel like I stepped out onto a completely new world. When I saw where and how the Na'vi lived, I was really seeing it for the first time. The creatures, the fauna and the colors were unique. It almost felt like I was a part of the story.<br /><br />The overall pacing was excellent. Once you see Pandora's surface for the first time, you'll be hooked. This experience doesn't seem to last over two-and-a-half hours and you will probably wish for more when it ends. Don't despair; there is now an extended cut available with an additional 16 minutes and extensive special features, as well as the likelihood of two sequels over the next few years. The popularity of Avatar almost guarantees that we will be seeing a lot more of Pandora in the future. I for one can't wait.<br /><br />Avatar is influenced by so many movies that it would be prohibitive to list them all. Dances with Wolves and The Matrix are certainly near the top of the list.<br /><br />Video Quality 5/5<br />Avatar looks better than any movie I have ever seen, with the exception of some fully-animated titles. Although the majority was created on a computer rather than filmed with a camera, it seems real and the detail is exceptional. The colors that we know are accurate, while the newly-invented surroundings and inhabitants appear consistent with the less-familiar colors. The image is so good that it adds to the feeling that you are stepping out onto an unknown world. Even the menu and subtitles look impressive. I really can't imagine a better quality presentationin the future.<br /><br />Audio Quality 5/5<br />The sound quality matches the picture quality. There is so much detail that it's a completely immersive experience. You can hear creatures all around you on the moon's surface. The latter action sequences carry impressive weight and the explosions seem real. The score matches the mood of the movie well and builds during important sequences, in a similar fashion to Lord of the Rings.

1439102724|5.0|I was so impressed with this books ability to make me think in a way that saw valid points for people on both sides of the spectrum. But in the end I was relieved when the right decision was made. I couldn't put this book down, I must say I even neglected making a dinner or two because of the need to see what happened next. The characters are all lovable and believable. Well worth the read, and the music is beautiful! Jodi Picoult will always be a favorite author of mine. Because she does her research on every subject she tackles in her novels, which only helps us to see them more clearly in our minds with the fine details. Kudos to you Jodi!

He has the proper insights that help create the \\"Enchanted\\" environment that is a win-win situation for either: Vendor - Client, Boss - Employee, Employee - Boss, Leaders - Followers, etc.  I have followed him for years on Twitter to get his sage advice.  This book seems to culminate that advice into a single resource that will continue to be on my bookshelf within easy reach to remind myself of the individual nuggets of gold that are within this book.

0385737955|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Maze Runner by James Dashner.  I had never read one of his works before.  It kept me intrigued because of the constant action and suspense.  It was impossible to put down.  It was written very clearly so it was easy to follow and I was able to read through the chapters quickly.  I related to the characters because they were all young adults who surpassed challenges while keeping their sense of humor.  The unknown adventure kept me riveted.  I plan to read the next books in the trilogy as soon as I can.

1400052173|1.0|I listened to this book on CD after listening to the interview with the author on amazon.  She stated that her story had to come into this book, I completely disagree with her.  This book and its history of HELA cells and the researchers of HELA is interesting. But the authors story and her relationship with the family of H Lacks is just another memoir of a train wreck.  Then after that the author makes all medical research on Cells seem like the the theft of our souls and being.  This is book is about people wallowing in self pity and not taking responsiblity for there mess that they have made themselves.  The author added her story because the HELA story would have only been good enough for an article in a magizine.  If you want a story of mess that most of the ingnorant poeple in the book self generated then this is the book for you.  If you want PC self pity this will be a triumph.  If you want a meaningless memoir that should have been a failed book project than again this is the book for you.

1594484805|4.0|Daniel Pink begins with a thesis that there are two main ideas for work: work done for extrinsic motivation and work done for intrinsic motivation.<br /><br />Traditional rewards (such as money) are very effective for repetitive, factory-labor jobs.  However, in the service-based economy, traditional rewards have little effect on performing better and often actually inhibits innovation while encouraging short-term thinking and unethical behavior.<br /><br />Pink asserts there are three intrinsic desires that workers wish to have met. When met, the worker is fully engaged in the task to a degree that they actually want to do the work, and derive meaning and joy from working.  These three desires are:<br /><br />Autonomy: to have control of how the work is done.<br />Mastery: to become truly excellent at doing the work.<br />Purpose: to be part of a cause that is bigger than one individual.<br /><br />Creating a situation where these three needs are met results in full engagement from the worker: the worker gladly works longer, harder, and more effectively.  The worker uses more creativity and recruits others to the cause. Money becomes a secondary consideration, and the worker enters into a state of \\"flow\\", which has opened up a new genre of business literature into itself.<br /><br />Pink fashions these insights together in a compelling manner.  While there is a great theory behind his book, it is tough to get to any points that are implementable.  Despite a multi-chaptered \\"toolkit\\", Pink offers the reader little in the way of advice for the downside.  I have seen many times an employee offered autonomy, only to become far less engaged and less productive.<br /><br />Pink's ideas are excellent.  However, his writings are belied by Pink's apparent lack of business experience.  His (brief) r&eacute;sum&eacute; appears to consist mainly of education, political and government jobs (such as a speechwriter).<br /><br />I look forward to these ideas being implemented and written about from a seasoned, respected executive such as Welch or Jobs.  There is clearly great merit in Pink's theory, but we will have to wait until the business world tests them where it counts most.bs.

030746363X|5.0|I used to like to think I knew a decent amount about keeping my body in pretty hi-evel shape from my time on active duty in the Marine Corps. Yeah, I didn't know much. I was just young and forced to work out constantly and had access to whatever diet I waned. Now that I'm in my mid-thirties and run a small business and have two young children, time to work out is a luxury and I have to treat it as such. Tim Ferriss's 4HB gave me the knowlege I need to maximize what I'm trying to accomplish with my body with the absolute minimum amount of time invested. I followed his advice in the introduction and read just the 97 pages I needed - and the results have been great. I'm really impressed and I feel more in control of my own body than I ever have before. Want to gain muscle fast? This is legit.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|So I knew this was going to be a strange movie going in, but this sorty still hit me on an unexpected level. It's one of those movies that you think about a few days later and leaves you feeling uncomfortable and disturbed. The relationship between the mother and daughter is creepy to say the least, but it really makes you wonder about how people can feed off each other's insanity. There were parts of this movie that would appeal to females more than males like all the dancing, but this one is worth sitting through guys, the sex scene with Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis is nothing short of amazing.

B004NSULHM|2.0|The new Radiohead album is unfortunately a disappointment. The first track starts with promise, but quickly dives into the electronic atmosphere that remains for most of the album.

B004QDCYJC|5.0|\\"In Paradisium\\" is the brand new, debut album by melodic/power metal supergroup \\"Symfonia\\". \\"Symfonia\\"s line up features striclty musicians who have served the international elite of melodic/power metal bands. Specifically the group features \\"Stratovarius\\" former leader, guitar hero Timmo Tolkki and bassist Jari Kainulainen, former \\"Angra\\" singer Andre Matos, drummer extraordinaire Uli Kusch (ex-\\"Helloween\\", ex-\\"Gamma Ray\\")and keyboardist Mikko H&auml;rkin (ex-\\"Sonata Arctica\\").<br /><br />\\"In Paradisium\\" is a surprisingly bright sounding album, delivering positive attitude through its colorful-you could call them fantasy oriented-themes. So the \\"Symfonia\\" debut clearly does not go down the darker heavy metal path as the latest \\"Stratovarius\\", \\"Helloween\\" and \\"Revolution Renaissance\\" albums did. Still, the material is as heavy, fast and intense as any fan of the genre would demand from these renowned musicians. The riffs are heavy and continuous, the rhythm section up tempo (with Uli's trademark improvisations and fills) while Andre's soft yet powerful harmonic vocals grant the album its melodic nature.<br /><br />Above all, one has to give credit to the band for keeping the songwriting as simple and direct as possible; almost every song opens on a classic riff, followed by catchy instrumental and vocal melodies, concluding to a large and satisfactory chorus. On a personal level, I was particularly surprised by Tolki's performance, clearly rejuvenated he comes up with classic sounding riffs and powerful melodies that reference the catchier side of 80s power metal. Favorite tracks include \\"Fields of Avalon\\", \\"Come by the hills\\",\\"Rhapsody in black\\" and \\"Pilgrim Road\\".<br /><br /> Needless to say \\"Symfonia\\" does not break any new ground in the genre of melodic/power metal, and in all fairess that was not its purpose, instead the aim was for the musicians to bring their greatest to the table to produce an album-highlight and that is exactly what \\"Symfonia- In Paradeisium\\" is. Looking forward to a follow up.follow up.

Most of his albums are not my cup of tea, nor do I care what other reviewers think.  But, from the first day I heard \\"Blow by Blow\\", I knew it was a one of a kind gathering of talented musicians who,together, made something greater than each of them could craft on their own.  It only happened once for this particular artist and \\"Blow by Blow\\" ranks right up there with the best fusion jazz being turned out in those days.  I was hot after \\"Wired\\" and got it home from the record store to be completely dissapointed.  I think, in retrospect, alot of it had to do with the band, the times and George Martin.  Buyer beware - do not overlook this album.  Blow by Blow was what the mid-70's was all about...it's cosmic, man.  Dig it.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is much more than a Young Adult read.  I'm an old adult and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  I couldn't put the book down and have encouraged many young and old alike to read these books.  It has so many unpredictible twists and turns you'll be wanting more when you finish the third.  Looking forward to another one of Suzanne's books!
B000F4LPJ6|4.0|I stumbled upon this movie after reading Suzanne Collins' \\"Hunger Games\\" and seeing how everyone keeps on comparing what happens in the book to this movie.  Just by reading about the premise, I had expected this to be some kind of a twisted exploitation film with lots of gratuitous violence.  But what I got is a thought-provoking film that is as relevant now as it was back when it was made at the beginning of the millenium.      So the story takes place in the near future, when the government in Japan has collapsed and youngsters are allowed to run amock...causing chaos and fear among the adults.  In an effort to curb the growing violence perpetrated by the youth of the nation, the government came up with what is referred to as the BR act.  Each year, a 9th grade class would be randomly selected and driven to a desert island under the guise of a class field trip.  Once there, they will be given a bag of food, a piece of weapon, and told that they will have 2 days in which to kill each until there is only 1 left.  To keep everyone under check, and make sure that there will be a winner, all the students are forced to wear a collar around their neck that will explode and kill everyone if there is still more than 1 person left alive at the end of the 2-day period.      Desipte what some people say about how violent this film is, I found the level of violence no more than what one would see in most R-rated movies these days.  The body count is high, but the cameras do not make a point to linger on the bloody scenes so that after the 1st couple scenes, the rest of the bloodbaths can no longer shock you.  Instead, you are allowed to focus on the nuanced relationships that develops between the students as some of them elect to follow the dictates of the game and turn on their friends, while others chose to rebel against the authority, to badn together and try to find ways to thwart the adults' plans for them.  For a film that starts out with a cast of 40+, the director dida very good job and developing the relationships and giving some of the characters personalities and enough background story so that you come to care about them.  There are also themes of trust, betrayal, friendship, and love peppered throughout the film...no small feat for a movie of this length.      Ultimately, this is not so much a movie about mindless violence but a commentary on a society that has become increasingly out-of-touch with its youth.  I've often thought that with the advent of the Internet age, where instant gratification is more the norm than the exception, where graphic violence are readily dispensed with the click of the button...that coupled with the tremendous strides in terms of economic advancement many countries have experienced over the last decade, the youth of the world has become increasingly more and more self-entitled, less willing to put in the hard work, and generally have exhibited a lack of understanding when it comes to distinguishing right from wrong.  While the solution this movie came up with is ridiculous and extreme, it does provide some much needed food for thought.

B002DKF54Q|5.0|Always a huge Roxy fan I very much enjoyed Eno's earlier work including; \\"Another Green World\\", \\"Here Come The Warm Jets\\", and \\"Taking Tiger Mountain By Strategy\\".

I listened to \\"Music for Airports\\" with a fresh pair of ears a couple of months ago and was absolutely transported! The music is so simple and delicate, so subtle and evocative that I spent an entire day listening to the CD over and over without getting bored.     I have since commenced ordering the rest of Eno's ambient catalog and now own Ambient Music 2, 3 and 4, \\"Discreet Music\\" and \\"Music For Films\\", among others. I just received \\"Thursday Afternoon\\", \\"The Pearl\\" and I have high hopes for \\"Apollo\\" Atmospheres and Soundtracks\\" which is currently on order and shipping as I type. In the process I have discovered a lot of great music, but I have yet to find anything that quite matches the whimsical, wistful elegance of \\"Music For Airports\\".     So much Eno. So little time.

B002ZNJW0O|4.0|The Lucky One   The Novel The Lucky One by, Nicholas Sparks uses incredible descriptions of small towns and southern weather, easily pictured characters and his vivid and thrilling plot make the novel impossible to put down.     Sparks has an crazy way of making you feel as if you are there when he describes each scene. From the hot and muggy late summer weather to the never ending down pour in early autumn. Never having been to any southern state myself I almost feel as if I can claim to know the feeling with never truly living through it, like I had sat with Logan at lunch myself. \\"He liked to eat here. The brackish water and shady oak with its low-slung branches draped with Spanish moss lent a prehistoric feeling to the place that he and Zeus both enjoyed. Through the trees at the end of his vision he noted a tree house and wood-planked rope bridge that appeared to be constructed with scraps, something thrown together by someone not completely sure what they were doing\\" (89 Sparks). Not only can you see just what the characters see but also just what its like to live in a small town, where everyone knows everyone.   Secondly, this novel is wonderfully written through multiple points of view but, the main character U.S. Marine Logan Thibault is made obvious by the sad and lonely journeys you take back in to his life in the marines. Where you learn the struggles he has been put through, his closest friend, and the luck he has encountered. Elizabeth is a divorced mother who lives with her son Ben and Nana the grandma who raised her. She spends time as a teacher, helping out with Nana's at home business boarding and training dogs and looking out for Nana after her recent stroke. Finally there is Keith Clayton Ex-husband to Elizabeth, town Sheriff and not to forget he's a Clayton and as explained by Keith means; \\" The Claytons had lived in Hampton County since 1753; in many ways, they were Hampton County. Family members included judges, lawyers, doctors, and landowners; even the mayor had married into the family\\" (56).    The way this book is written may play a very important role in this novel but what altogether ties this book in is the story line. Recently returned marine, Logan Thibault walks across the country in search of a girl he believes may have been his good luck charm in his last tour of duty in Iraq. He knows very little of who this girl is and where she may be. The only facts he does know is what he can see in the photograph. By complete luck he finds her, afraid to tell her the truth he ends up falling in love with not only her but her son Ben and grandma Nana. But in towns as small as these nothing stays a secret for long and the power of fate is stronger then all.   This novel like all others by Nicholas Sparks is a must read for anyone who enjoys a classic love story. Its small town setting unforgettable characters and enticing plot pull this book together to make is one of his best novels yet. Don't forget what his books are famous for though, and have that tissue box ready.
B000TGJ80S|4.0|Francis Ford Coppola's adaption of \\"Dracula\\" is a beautiful film, stunningly photographed with magnificent sets, costumes and one of the best scores I've ever heard for a film. Relying on classic film techniques, like superimposing scenes and reversing the film, Coppola proves that an effective film can be accomplished without digital special effects achieved from a computer. It is a movie that can be enjoyed simply by reveling in the way it looks. Some scenes, notably Jonathan Harker's trip to Dracula's castle and Dracula's arrival in England and the seduction of Lucy in her garden during a ferocious storm are quite spectacular.<br /><br />However, some major flaws keep it from being a first rate film. First, the story-line has been reconfigured with Mina (Winona Ryder) being the reincarnation of the love of Dracula (or Vlad the Impaler, as he is in the first scenes). Turning Dracula into a simpering, crying fool doesn't work and the romantic scenes between the two slow the film to a snail's pace. Aside from that, some really bad acting is on display. Gary Oldman is quite impressive but the remaining cast varies from adequate to embarrassingly bad. Anthony Hopkins overacts, spewing out his lines in a rapid, gun-fire manner and comes across as deranged. Sadie Frost, as Lucy, seems to be channeling a porn actress. The worst though is Keanu Reeves, who is like a student in a bad high school play production. His accent, reactions, line readings and even the way he steps across the threshold of Dracula's castle is rigid and forced.<br /><br />This is a movie that can be enjoyed as a spectacular visual extravaganza if you can overlook its numerous flaws.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I loved this movie! Both Wilson and Stephens are so talented, playing such strong and yet vulnerable characters. In high school \\"Jane Eyre\\" was one of my favorite books of all time and still is, however this movie, while changing a few parts, really illuminated the meaning of the book and its themes to me even more. I have to admit it has sent me on somewhat of a spiritual journey too, deeper into my Christian faith. To see an orphan grow into the adult Jane Eyre, so gracefully and yet confidently portrayed by Ruth Wilson it becomes even more evident that in spite of all the hostility she has endured she knows Who really loves her. She is a treasured child of God and understands her value on an almost \\"other-worldly\\" level. I strive for such peace and contentment in the face of turmoil and strife. You truly feel involved in both the journey of Jane and her beloved Mr. Rochester. My boyfriend also loved it. This will be staying in my movie library for years to come. :) I pray it blesses you too!!

B004EC5IUW|5.0|I've been a fan of the series since about the time it came to the states. I never got the chance to see the original rebuild however. This part of the new set blew me away. The new visual effects and tweaked story line make this a must have for anyone that sees themselves as true fans of the genre. (sorry naruto fans gtfl).
B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is a fantastically funny show, great for children and adults, great comedy scenes, great action scenes, and the musical backing was awsome, felt like an opera production at times as the music was so good.  Another great movie produced in 3D.
030746363X|4.0|So I'm following what's in the book and over a course of 2+ months I lost ~13 kilos (~29lbs) and several inches around my waist. I can wear my old jeans that I wore 2-3 yrs ago! Actually the became a bit loose and I had to put a new hole on my belt! Things have changed dramatically for me and I don't look at it as a diet for a while now but as a change of lifestlye. I haven't trained much either apart from doing some kettlebells 1-2x a week for an hour. Thank you Tim Ferriss!
B0018BF1JA|5.0|Well, this is an interesting collection of five albums of the famous virtuoso guitarist Steve Vai which now come at a very good price. Of course the CDs are in cardboard boxes and there are no such things as lyrics, photos, etc. Even the line-ups are not given for some of the albums, but that's quite normal considering the price. The albums are complete, there are no missing tracks and they sound as perfect as ever.     Now, let me try to explain the title of this brief review. If I had to rate this set just as a compillation of five independent albums, I would give it only three stars because it consists of three great albums, one mediocre and one complete rubbish. But still three aforementioned great opuses are so great that they easily redeem all the faults of the other two. Even for these three albums, in my very humble opinion, it is worth while buying this set. So...     \\"Flex-Able\\" (1984), here given with the so called \\"leftovers\\", e.g. bonus tracks, is the first solo album of Steve Vai, released more than 20 years ago and on his own expense. However all this is not enough to justify it. This is the rubbish here. It is really astonishing that Steve Vai has ever been able to produce such a rot. Not only there is almost nothing interesting in the guitar part but the music on the whole lacks structure, melody, passion and in short - lacks everything except weird harmonies, bad vocals and pitiful attempts for something melodic. It shouldn't at all have been reissued in this box set.     \\"Sex and Religion\\" (1993) dates from the time when Steve Vai tried to form a band named VAI. I can't say the attempt was very successful. There are occasional sublime moments in the album, like \\"Touching Tongues\\" and \\"Rescue Me or Bury Me\\" which are among the best compositions Stevie has ever done but on the whole I find the album boring and listening to it from A to Z is a tiresome business.     \\"Passion and Warfare\\" (1990), \\"Alien Love Secrets\\" (1995) and \\"Fire Garden\\" (1996) are the masterpieces which make the box set worth its money. The first two are purely instrumental, and the third one has vocals in some of the songs which makes one wish the album was purely instrumental too, but this is the only drawback I can see and it is a minor one. Had Steve Vai not recorded anything else but \\"Tender surrender\\" and \\"For the love of God\\", he would have remained for the future generations as one the greatest masters of the electric guitar. His technical skills are astonishing but they are just the surface. And below it there are storms of passion and violent, almost frightening, emotions that I have never heard in the playing of anyone else.     All in all, three outstanding albums which one can listen to again and again discovering something new and getting a lot of pleasure every time. And for this price that's a really good deal.
B00005OM5L|1.0|Ok, first, this rating and do not buy advice is based on the disc itself and not the content or the seller.   The seller shipped FAST.   Clapton is outstanding.    BUT THE AUDIO ISNT SYNCHED TO THE VIDEO !!!!!!!!!  LOL...  Some of you may not care. I really don't care enough to send it back. But when you watch the drummer you can clearly see he is late to the audio. I shoot and edit video on a semi professional basis and I could see it right at the start.  So I can only guess this DVD has been stamped out so many times that it is being shipped that way from the main supplier. Whoever that is.    Also, it is not widescreen. And when you select the \\"Biography\\" from the main menu, you get computer code where the English writing should be. LOL. Do I care? Not really. Not enough to send it back.    The beauty in this DVD is Clapton. good lord... he is the epitome of smoooooooth....     Maybe you can find this from some other manufacturer, maybe only mine is bad. I don't know. It is what it is.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|What can one say about such a masterpiece? Alastair Fothergill and BBC have definitely made a revolution in the natural history documentaries. The subtitle of the series is perhaps the best description that can be given: \\"as you've never seen it before.\\"     Not only is \\"Planet Earth\\" the first such documentary to be shot in high definition, but it is also the first one to exploit air views and time lapse photography to an unprecedented degree. Watching savana dogs hunting antelopes or wolves hunting caribou from the air as well as autumn changing of the leaves or ice invasion in a few seconds is a relly breathtaking experience. It is something that simply cannot be described. It must be seen.     The best thing about the series, however, is that all 11 episodes are not mere feast for the eyes. Every episode is dedicated to certain wilderness - jungle, seasonal forests, deserts, caves, rivers, seas of grass, shallow seas, deep oceans, poles, mountains, or all of them together - and in less than an hour gives the most comprehensive view possible in so short a time. The accompanying narration - with the wonderful voice of David Attenborough - is always to the point, clarifying every detail of the picture and is with so fine a diction that even people for whom English is not native language can easily understand every single word. Moreover, the narration gives additional and often essential details that complement the visual aspect in an astonishing way. Indeed, the very presence of Sir David - although in voice only, he does not appear otherwise - is the best possible recommendation for the series, even though in this case he is not the author but only a narrator.     There is one more thing that need be mentioned. Some faint-hearted people might well find the series too brutal and offensive for their taste. To my mind, that's pretty silly but I daresay it is not altogether unnatural for silly race like mankind. The fact is that a great part of the series, although byno means all the time, is occupied with the everlasting ritual between the hunters and the hunted, the predators and the prey. There are some scenes of animals killing other animals that are quite brutal even if they are done in the finest possible taste. Wolves chasing and killing calves seen from the air, crocodiles dragging antelopes in the river, a fox killing several little chicks in seconds, a crocodile snatching bird fallen from a tree, seals pouncing on penguins, a tiger surprising a monkey from behind, a huge pride of thirty lions or so chasing and killing an elephant, great white shark coming out of the water and catching a seal at the same time, and so on so forth. All these scenes are not too graphic, they are invariably shot as to minimize the gruesome details but they do often have a certain brutality that can cause some mental disturbance of people with especially wrecked nerves. There are also some very moving and deeply saddening scenes, like an elephant lost in the sand storm following his fellow's trace but in the wrong direction to the desert or a white bear - the biggest carnivore on Earth - exhausted from days swimming and ferocious fights with huge walruses laying down and waiting for the death to come.     I have mixed feelings myself watching such scenes. On the one hand, at the first moment, I am terrified and shocked, but immediately afterwards I am overwhelmed with awe and admiration for the predator and pity for the prey. I remember that that is the way the things really are in the wild and that's the way they should be. I am much more astonished at the fine balance between hunters and hunted that has allowed them to live together for tens of thousands of years than disgusted by the apparent brutality of the killing or broken by the heart-rending stories of some animals. Men are by far more brutal creatures than any animal after all, and I am much more horrified by men killing lots of animals just for pleasure than by any natural killing of the hunted by the hunters. Nevertheless, I think I should warn the more sensitive (or shallow, depends on the point of view) people who are going to watch the series that their sensitivity might be offended and they may be revolted before watched half of the series. I also think that anybody who is really interested in the nature and the wild life will have no such problems.     After all, the main goal of the series was to show some of the last wildernesses that existed on Earth and how their animals, plants and rocks really look like. And Alastair Fothergill and company, working at the cutting edge of the modern entertainment, have done a superb job of it. The facts that \\"Planet Earth\\" is not only a stunning and brilliantly realised visual conception, but actually far more serious and thought-provoking than mere entertainment can hardly be denied.
057122444X|5.0|This book is smaller than i thought it would be. it is only a little bigger than my hand. most pages dont have very much on them but it has great little pictures and stories. Great to throw in a purse or bag and take anywhere. i love it because the pictures are great and it can be read over and over again!
B000003CUJ|2.0|This CD could have been wonderful. But now it is just mediocre, to say the least.     The idea of Lorin Maazel to compress the four great music dramas of Richard Wagner that comprise 'The Ring' in one CD and without any singing is highly commendable. Such an idea certainly could, and probably did, win new fans for the whole cycle; 70 minutes without words is a great deal easier to listen to than 15 hours with hundreds of pages of text, after all. Maazel's conducting is excellent and the sound of Berliner Philharmoniker is glorious. The problem is elsewhere.     The problem indeed lies with Maazel's selection. He tried, perhaps, to include a bit too much of the story or too many of the leitmotivs, ending with absurd cuts: 'The Entry of the Gods in Valhalla' from 'Das Rheingold' is completely missing and 'Wotan's Farewell' is ridiculously shortened - it starts in the middle and finishes a way before the end with the famous 'Magic Fire Music'. Both of these excerpts are surely among the most beautiful in the whole 'Ring' and they are most likely to win new fans for the whole cycle - no insult intended, but such a concept as Maazel's is doubtless concerned more with people not so seriously interested in 'The Ring', or those who want to start with something lighter before turning to the original; both things are only too natural. Moreover, both 'The Entry' and the 'Farewell' are essential for the story. Not to mention that the famous 'Magic Fire Music', the astonishing finale of 'Die Walkuere', is completely missing from the CD despite what is written on the cover - the music stops abruptly just before Wotan's summoning of Loge, the demigod of fire. Such a cut is simply outrageous. Another great omission is the famous theme in the brass from the so called 'Forging Song' from 'Siegfried'. Maazel included the most unremarkable music from this song and even wasted almost two minutes with the entirely unimportant dragon and its slaying.     All these wonderful parts - 'The Entry', 'The Magic Fire', more from the 'Forging Song' - should have been retained. There is enough space on the CD, especially considering some omissions that also should have been made - the dragon's slaying, Mime's fright, Donner's episode. The CD could have been wonderful should it have concentrated on fewer episodes and developed them more extensively. Now it looks pretty much like a hackwork, or patch-work is perhaps a better description. Maazel and Telarc could also have thought of 2 CD edition in which all four music dramas could have been infinitely better represented. But it was not to be. Pity.     If you have never listened to the complete 'Ring', or at least a more extensive collection of chunks, and you like classical music, then by all means get hold of this CD. There is a lot to enjoy here. But don't expect to get anything near to the experience a Highlights disc with singing, not to say a complete recording, might offer you - should you have the time and the application to attempt listening to them of course.     Applause and five stars for Lorin Maazel's idea and superb conducting, and also for Telarc's wonderful digital recording. A good deal of boos and one star (maximum) for Maazel's, to put it mildly, ridiculous musical selection and shameful cutting.    P. S. An infinitely better way to start your ''Ring adventure'' are the collections of excerpts from the legendary complete recordings of [[ASIN:B000006P4T Solti]] and [[ASIN:B000001GC1 Karajan]]. And don't forget to follow the librettos. They are not included in these highlights-editions, of course, but the little guides of the English National Opera are not a bad place to start: [[ASIN:0714540781 Das Rheingold]], [[ASIN:0714540196 Die Walküre]], [[ASIN:0714540404 Siegfried]], [[ASIN:0714540633 Die Götterdämmerung]]
B002ZG976U|3.0|The story is predictable but the musical numbers are very enjoyable.  Unfortunately it sufferes from a malady that too many modern films suffer from - the sound track.  To hear the conversations the viewer needs to turn up the sound but when the music comes on you get blown from the room.<br /><br />But over all its a fun movie and let's face it - it has Cher and Chistina what more needs to be said?
0393061310|4.0|Very good book. def covers the topic in extensive detail. However, the only drawback is that the book is very wordy and long. I feel it could have been much more precise and probably around only half the length, this is the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars. Just overly/ unnecessarily long.
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I didn't read the novel and from what I've gathered from other reviews, I might have missed something important.  I did have a little trouble figuring out the cast of characters in the beginning and the backstory, which is of prime importance, was not sufficiently emphasized.  The title, \\"Persuasion,\\" comes from the fact that the heroine, Anne, had been persuaded by an older woman who had stepped in as a surrogate mother, to refuse the proposal of marriage from a Captain Wentworth on the grounds that he was socially inferior to her family.      I guess I should have turned on the subtitles, earlier than I did, because I got the impression that the refused suitor was Wentworth's brother, a cleric.  Both clerics and sailors were considered to be unsuitable to Anne's advisor as well as to her super-snobby father.  So, when the Captain appeared, eight years later, I had a hard time understanding Anne's shocked demeanor.      So I can't blame the film entirely for my cluelessness for the first part of the film.  However I do blame the film for the casting.  Amanda Root, cast at the heroine, plays lackluster to such an extreme that one wonders what the Captain ever saw in her, let alone the fact that he carried a flame for her for the entire eight years of his absence.  True, she's a little depressed, but she's still young, in her twenties and most girls at that age have a little more spunk and color than she had.  She has turned into such a self-sacrificing drudge that one conjures up visions of Cinderella, especially when she's surrounded by the juicy, joyful and colorful girls who are her companions.      The Captain, played by the wonderful Ciaran Hinds, seems awfully old to be her suitor, but I suppose that older men frequently married young girls at that time.  There is zero chemistry between them and one wonders what a different film it would have been if a more interesting, lively, actress had been cast as Anne.  True, they put makeup on her later on and give hernicer clothes and a prettier hairstyle but she still emanates as much joy and passion as a piece of unbuttered toast.  She certainly embodies strength of character and reliability, but gee, give the Captain some reason to overlook all the other beauties and settle for her.  From the other reviewers who read the novel, I got the impression that Austen had written Anne as a much livelier young woman.      Other than that, it,s a good enough story, the rest of the cast is very good, the scenery is wonderful and the whole production lives up to what we have come to expect from British productions of classics.  It's certainly not a waste of time.
0393327345|5.0|This book was awesome, the author captures your attention without writing a traditional \\"narrative\\". The book almost seems stream of conscious, but this is not a detractor, I like this characteristic. There are tons of great lines that convey the angst and feelings of nihilism of the character. The movie does a better job of the split personality thing though. You don't really get a sense of the contrast between Tyler and the main character in the book. And in the movie Tyler is a more interesting character

030746363X|3.0|I have to say that I lost weight right away then plateaued.  I have always believed in eating as a lifestyle change and never in \\"diets.\\"  I like many of the suggestions by TF.  He is almost impossible to contact.  There is a decent blog...sometimes loaded with \\"frivolous\\" questions.  I do NOT think its the end all - be all.  Of course, TF is out to make a bunch of dough - why not?  So was everyone else from Richard Simmons to SouthBeach.  I think, basically, its a good reminder about how to eat (other than suggestions to eat more fat and loads of red meat)!  I am not into spending loads of time in the gym and have therefore NOT reaped the benefits (maybe one day?) also I refuse to spend all that bread on supplements...I say, its worth the cost of the book and investigation...try it for yourself and see what happens - I always maintain that one should listen to their own guidance and NOT do anything that is contrary to one's own belief system despite urging from anyone (not the least of which is a self-proclaimed authority!)  Good Luck!  If anything changes, I'll be sure to update my review.  PS:  Despite numerous FB posts and requests tocorrespond with TF, I never achieved any level of contact with either TF, himself, or any of his alleged numerous PA's.
B003Y5HWMW|4.0|I'm not in the habit of reviewing shows before they're even on DVD, but I'm making an exception in this instance. GREAT show! A lot of effort made to create an alternative world for the imagination to travel to. Love it, love it, love it! And the acting is SUPERB! But there's a really big problem. The sex scenes are BRUTAL, IMMORAL, DISGUSTING, SADISTIC--and(cinematically) UNNECESSARY! Since this is a work of imagination, the director needs to allow the audience to USE its imagination a little more in regards to sex! That can still be effective. In \\"Key Largo,\\" what was it Rocko whispered in Nora's ear? Hummm. Something scurrilous, no doubt. By John Huston NOT letting the audience know, the imagination is allowed to run rampant . . . and the scene becomes intriguing instead of just revolting. Come on! I have to watch this show with my clicker in hand! When the barbarian horde comes on, I have to switch the show off--wait for about 5 or 6 minutes--and then switch it back on again! If I'm doing it, I'm sure some other people are doing it too. The editor needs to wake up and do his job!
B004LAIU4I|2.0|Anticipating, receiving, then sinking into this disc reminded me SO much of the similarly inexplicable media hype that preceded Neil Young's CD \\"Passionate\\" a decade or so ago: best thing in years, classic in the making, etc. etc.  I really do love both of these guys, and check out everything they do, and let me say that, sadly but surely, So Beautiful or So What will be about as neglected on my CD rack as is Passionate; they're both very middling releases amidst the many peaks of both careers.    In this case, any of you who got drawn to the spinning spotlights shooting up in to the sky from the So Beautiful release party after having ignored Paul for awhile are hereby encouraged to run out and find a used copy of Surprise, which really IS the third piece of his later career trifecta (along with Graceland and the even better Rhythm of the Saints--and for perspective, I'm the kind of Simon fan for whom Hearts and Bones is the other slightly smaller mountain of note among the pleasant rolling hills of his solo releases over the years).  Surprise has the kinds of chills and depth that reflect Paul's true gift to us through all these years....do check it out if you missed it!      Don't get me wrong, everything he does is worth hearing, and there are some great lines and couplets here, but very little, maybe nothing, that gels into full songs I'll savor the way I do two or three dozen of his gems.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|What can I say? This series is just amazing!! With the very first episode, it got me hooked up. Blood, fights, drama, sex,friendship, love, it just has everything. Things go up and down from one episode to another, what you think is going to happen never does, but what you don't even imagine, happens out of nowhere! And the end just leaves you wanting more and seething for the second season to come out. I really loves this series!!!

0316098337|5.0|I didn't want to read this novel, but my book club chose it. My hesitation had nothing to do with the author's work. I simply didn't want to immerse myself in such a depressing setting. But I'm SO glad I read it. I struggled through the beginning. Again, not because the writing wasn't stellar--Ms. Donohue pulled me right in, and I loved Jack by the time I finished the second page. But my heart was just broken for him, and for the first time ever I chose to sneak a peak deeper into the story to make sure there were other people involved--to make sure there was hope. Even if you cringe at the idea of what Jack and his mother are going through, I enthusiastically encourage you to read this book. As the editorial review says, there are moments of hope and beauty here. Without resorting to melodrama or sentimentality, Ms. Donohue managed to bring tears to my eyes several times, and in at least one instance they were tears of joy.
0307595862|5.0|I rate this novel as outstanding.<br /><br />The plotting is complex and yet simple, with lots of detail and twists. The style is light and, while carefully paced, has a sharpness and vivid movement; Nesbo almost paints his scenes, and accomplishes a lot with few wasted words (Yes, of course this is a translation but it seems clear that the strengths are intrinsic to the original and while there are some clumsy sentences, the overall voice comes through vividly and compellingly.) What most stands out for me in Nesbo's work is how he makes you walk alongside the characters, including the monsters. It's not quite the same as identifying with or empathizing with them as being engaged with them. Their motivations, fears and self-justifications make them all too real. Harry Hole, the detective at the center of the story is a stock character: alcoholic, a failure in his relationships, brilliant, dominating, fatalistic and sad. There is no sense of possible redemption and it seems clear that he will continue to unravel. Nesbo doesn't explain or justify him but somehow you come to understand him and in the end hope for him. Nesbo is equally skilled in depicting the women who are the victims and in several ways the real protagonists. Several of them stay on in my mind as real people beyond the constraints of the story.<br /><br />One of the difficulties in reviewing any mystery/thriller is not giving away too much of the plot. This one has many gyrations and turns that come together convincingly. His villains are sociopathic and self-absorbed; I am not an admirer of horror shows like Silence of the Lambs or Stephen King's work but my guess is that Nesbo travels in their territory but at a somewhat more discreet level of overt nastiness. I didn't have a sense of horror though the story is horrific and there is always a wariness a you read of something evil this way treads. What makes the book effective for me is the skill in the story-telling. There is no striving for effect and the plot and characters intertwine smoothly and dramatically not melodramatically.<br /><br />It's time to stop pigeonholing writers like Nesbo as part of a Scandinavian \\"school\\" of thriller/mystery, with the corresponding benchmarking with Henning Menkel (Wallender) and Stieg Larssen. Nesbo has his own voice, characterization and touch. He is for me one of the Big League players in the field that includes Michael Connolly, Robert Crais, Lee Child and George Pelicanos. He matches them in his own distinctive strengths and adds a special weightiness and power. The Devil's Star is the other book in his Harry Hole series that I have read that along with this establishes him as a brilliant mystery writer - the story is very well constructed - and like all the ones above as a mythmaker, in that Hole stands out along with Menkel's Wallender, Connolly's Bosch and Haller and Child's Reacher as powerful inventions of characters who command the page, engage your concern and draw you into their world.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.and characters intertwine smoothly and dramatically not melodramatically.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|First of all, this is definitely a film worth seeing.       It is more for the performances, as this is an actor's and director's showcase. Natalie Portman is simply stunning and gives her best performance to date.       However, the film is actually quite thin and undercooked from a narrative standpoint. The visuals can be entertaining and there are some incredibly tense moments, but the film is light on suspense or any nuanced emotion.       I think if you watch this film simply expecting entertainment, you will come out with more than you bargained for and you will NOT be disappointed.
B004LUHQ1G|3.0|As a lifelong Foo fan (they are one of my favorite bands), I found Wasting Light to be a little disappointing.  To be sure, there are some good songs on here, and it DOES rock, but none of these songs compare to classics like Everlong, Best Of You or The Pretender.  The only song that comes close is the closer, Walk.  The Foos are known for creating great rock anthems and catchy songs with great pop hooks.  There is little of that here.  Overall, a very good record, just not great.
B0038BBA4I|4.0|When i first got it, I was quite happy with the album b/c of its unique style for contemporary American music. A very fresh pop music to hear.  The musicians and harmonies are great.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games, written by Suzanne Collins, is an incredible book that uses vivid description to leave the impression that the reader is in the story.  The story follows Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl, and her struggles as she is forced into an all out blood bath.  Some readers have labeled this book a science fiction novel, which I agree with this label on this assessment to an extent.  I agree that futuristic technology played a major role in the book, but the events that happened in the book I found to be realistic and believable.  I enjoyed reading The Hunger Games because there was non-stop action throughout the whole book.  The author did a really good job in creating a protagonist in which almost all readers can relate to.  For these reasons, I suggest this book to lovers of action and adventure novels.  This book will not disappoint you.

As a mother who has to continously juggle motherhood with working full time, I am so familiar with situations Kate went through, and so this novel touched me to the core.    I am not too happy with how the book ended though, for me it was depressing. I think it maybe personal, because I am unable to \\"sort it out\\" the way Kate did. Some people do not have this luxury.  I would have preferred if I saw Kate getting through this with no quick fixes.

0307272702|5.0|I bought the Kindle version in January of 2011. Being a scientist, I appreciated the author's evidence-based approach to the topic and became convinced that I needed to make some changes in my diet and lose some of my 238 pounds. Rather than doing a rigid Atkins-style low-carb diet, I simply implemented new eating habits (mostly avoidance habits) based on what I'd learned in Why We Get Fat. After a little over three months, I've lost 20 pounds without hunger or cravings. More importantly, my triglycerides, always a problem for me, are *way* down. So, while this book isn't sold as a diet book, it turned out to be exactly what I needed -- a rational explanation of \\"Why We Get Fat\\" on which I could base a new eating lifestyle. Thanks, Gary!
B004I4H8QS|5.0|Two discs-76,57 minutes each approximately.  The sound is clean and open-better than past editions, and world's away better than the original, muddy, vinyl release.  The discs snap inside the usual fold-out holder like other Deluxe Editions, except there's no protective plastic sleeve this time around.  The booklet has information about the band, the songs-who plays on what, and includes period photos-you've probably already seen the two-page photo-collage from the original gate-fold  album.  This edition is for people who don't have the original version of this album from just a few years ago, as far as sound quality, but there are slight differences-listeners will have to decide for themselves.<br /><br />The first disc is taken up with the original 2 LP album.  By now most people, if not at least familiar with the music, have owned a copy for many years.  Also by now, most people know the story behind the album-Clapton's intense playing, and the frustrated, heart broken vocals because of his love for his friend, George Harrison's wife.  Nothing really needs to be said about these songs-they speak for themselves.  But it's interesting that when the album was originally released, it didn't create much excitement.  At the time people actually did ask-\\"Does Clapton play on this album\\"?  \\"Is he a sideman\\"?  \\"Whose Derek\\"?  Well, it didn't take long before several songs became popular through radio play, and the album to be hailed a classic.<br /><br />The second disc is where things get interesting.  After playing on \\"All Things Must Pass\\", Clapton decided that Phil Spector should produce a new album Clapton was going to record.  But the single (included here) \\"Tell The Truth\\", along with \\"Roll It Over\\" was quickly withdrawn by the band.  Hearing these sides it's fairly apparent that Spector wasn't the right choice for the album.  Several tracks from the aborted second album are also here.  While they have their moments, the absence of catalyst Duane Allman on guitar is telling.  The sound and feel is very different-Clapton needed a good , fiery player to spark him into playing his best.  I was lucky enough to hear the band live, and the difference without Allman was very apparent.  There were exciting moments, but that initial fire was all but gone.  At times Clapton sounded bored-as if he had tuned up and tuned out.<br /><br />\\"Mean Old World\\", an old blues workhorse, is here with both Clapton and Allman laying into the tune on acoustic guitars, which is a highlight (of several) on this disc.  It's another instance where the rapport between the two guitarists is apparent.  Allman was a good acoustic blues player, and here his style blends with Clapton's into an almost intuitive rendition of this great old song.  It's too bad that there aren't any other similar tunes, Clapton's world weary vocals, and the simple drum beat keeping time is a good combination.  If you own the 3 disc anniversary set, you know this tune already, but it's still a great version.<br /><br />The two versions of \\"Got To Get Better In A Little While\\" are interesting, and fill in a gap in the group's discography.  The jam version is just that-loose and fluid.  The finished version (Bobby Whitlock went back into the studio to flesh out and complete the tune) is simply a more polished sounding song.  This great tune has always been popular, and both versions are very worthwhile.<br /><br />But, arguably, the best tracks on this disc are from Johnny Cash's TV show.  During it's run, Cash had a number of good musical guests, besides his own performances.  I still remember the excitement of hearing different generations of great musicians launch into \\"Matchbox\\" (especially), and hearing the core band playing that night.  The excitement of the performances could almost be felt through the TV.  Johnny Cash with his own show?  Clapton as a musical guest?  Too much!  Many people (like me) have hoped and waited that this great music would get a good, legitimate release.  All the excitement, the history, and the dueling musicians, plus the original band's performance (and seeing Cash in an atypical white, frilly-cuffed shirt), mark this batch of songs as another highlight on this edition.<br /><br />With now  many years of hindsight, the band (originally called \\"Del and the Dominos\\") came together in one of those rare moments.  The combination of a fully seasoned rhythm section, a fiery yet sensitive guitarist like Allman, good songs (both by the band and outsiders), and Clapton's unrequited love for a woman he thought he could never have, produced a classic album.  With Allman to play off of, Clapton's playing soared to heights of near abandon, with Allman matching him note for note.  His obsession for Harrison's wife sharpened his writing, singing, and playing skills like never before.  Clapton has said that Allman was the musical brother he never had.  Their intuitive playing made the band come alive.  The first disc is a classic.  The second disc shows what the band sounded like without Allman, and the fact that Clapton was losing interest in the band.  But there are a number of gems-the acoustic tune, the Cash TV tracks, even the versions of \\"Got To Get Better In A Little While\\", are all exciting, important additions to the original album.  This is one \\"Deluxe Edition\\" that's worth owning in it's entirety, especially if you don't own a previous edition that's been remastered.and the dueling musicians, plus the original band's performance (and seeing Cash in an atypical white, frilly-cuffed shirt), mark this batch of songs as another highlight on this edition.

0679412697|4.0|1st this review pertains ONLY to the Everman's Library edition only.<br />The story is great, although anyone used to reading this genre can tell way in advance how the story will end up. Even so, it is well-written w/o lots of susperfluous dialogue that is found in JA's other books.<br />The problem with this edition is that the introduction represents the worst of academic English department trash I have read in years. Almost indecipherable, it adds nothing to the experience and shows in full color why academic English professors (and the depts. that support them) are a laughing stock. Skip the intro, and maybe even buy a cheaper edition of this title as well.

She says nothing unusual, there was nothing noteworthy about her experience at a country club minimum security prison. Her outcome was unremarkable. Watch some episodes of Locked Down or the prison pups show and you will see some noteworthy things that will shake your own private reality. But don't bother with this book if you are looking to be moved by a literary experience. She is laughing all the way to the bank/best seller list.

B004K4IZ54|5.0|After just purchasing a Sony 3D tv it was time to pick up some 3D Blu Ray movies. The selection isn't that big yet so there isn't that much to choose from, but I decided to go with Tron: Legacy as my first 3D Blu Ray. Going into this I hadn't been a Tron fan before, I actually hadn't even seen the original until 3 days before I bought this. But this movie just blew my expectations out of the water. The picture quality, special effects, and the sound are just incredible (and Olivia Wilde is always good to look at lol). Add 3D to that mix and WOW. The movie itself was also fantastic, I enjoyed the story and Jeff Bridges delivers like he always does. So I am definitely a Tron fan now, definitely one of the BEST movie purchases I've ever made.      End Of Line.
0307595579|4.0|The novels themselves are marvelous, but I do have just one quip that I dislike about this set: the symbols on the spines can easily peel off when the novels are read. So based on that, I haven't actually been reading the series because I would like for the symbols to stay on (which I guess kind of makes the novels obsolete). I still have the paperback versions of the first two novels, so I can still read those, but I'm kind of in a pickle if I want to read \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" Nonetheless, the novels are wonderfully smashing; I do wish, however, that there was some way to handle the novels without having the symbols peel off.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just purchased this DVD based upon reviews by other purchasers.  I would consider myself athletic; I typically do cardio and weight training five times per week.  I wanted something to change up my routine.  I used to have a personal trainer but that doesn't seem to fit into my budget as I am planning for my wedding.  I did my first track last night.  I completed level 1 and did a 30 minute walk on my treadmill.  I can say that I am sore today.  So far I'm a fan - I haven't done it long enough to see results but I'm sure I will.  If you want a tough workout without spending hours at the gym - this will do it.  There are no breaks and you will sweat.  It is a bit tough on the joints - just put a good mat down and you will be good. Just remember its about 30 minutes of your time as opposed to a couple hours in the gym.  Jillian is known as a tough trainer and that is exactly what she delivers.

B0031SU2Y2|5.0|Philippe Lioret has written (with Emmanuel Courcol, Olivier Adam, and Serge Frydman) and directed this touching and compelling story of the trials of immigrants attempting to escape war-torn Iraq, reminding us of yet another aspect of the brutality of war. Titled WELCOME, it is anything but, as it demonstrates the averse feelings of the European countries to the plight of immigrants.  This is a solid, well written and sculpted story that in the hands of a small cast of excellent actors reaches for the heart of the viewer and finds it.<br /><br />Simon Calmat (Vincent Lindon) is a French swimming coach in the painful period of signing divorce papers from his wife Marion (Audrey Dana), a socially impassioned woman who serves at the food kitchen in Calais, France, providing nourishment and support for homeless immigrants. Simon discovers a young Kurdish illegal immigrant from Mosul, Iraq, Bilal Kayani (Firat Ayverdi), who has endured torture form the Turks who force him to wear a black sack over his head for an extended period of time until he escapes.  In Calais he pays 500 Euros and joins with a group of fellow asylum seekers in an attempt to be smuggled by truck through the  English Channel Tunnel,  but his memory of the hood experience has made him terrified of wearing the plastic bag over his head required of the 'clandestines' when crossing the borders to avoid the CO2 detectors used by the guards. Bilal's dream is to cross into England where his girlfriend  Mina (Derya Ayverdi, Firat's real life sister!) waits, attempting to avoid an arranged marriage her father demands. Largely due to Bilal's inability to keep the plastic bag over his head during the attempted escape, the immigrants are captured and returned to France.  It is then that Simon sees him on the street and befriends him, not only accepting him as a swimming pupil (Balil's dream is to swim across the English Channel for Mina) but also sharing his home and food with him.  Bilal is polite and grateful and a bond forms between the lonely Simon and Bilal.  A nosey neighbor exposes Simon as an illegal alien protector and Bilal runs away to protect Simon's reputation. Knowing that Bilal is determined to swim the English Channel Simon helps as best he can, but the film ends  in a surprise  that affects everyone who has been involved with the act of humanity to an illegal immigrant.<br /><br />Vincent Lindon is brilliant as the newly compassionate Simon, and Firat Ayverdi is a very fine new actor who should enjoy a successful future in films: he simply has it all - looks, screen presence, and acting ability. One aspect of the film that makes it so very powerful is the manner in which Loiret explores the souls of Bilal and his wary protector Simon: WELCOME unveils a world of overwhelming forces, both natural and social, that examine the waters of history,  forces that may be resisted, but they will not be stopped.  This is a film that should be considered imperative watching for every member of society. Grady Harp, April 11nd forms between the lonely Simon and Bilal.

There are now many hundreds of thousands who have run marathons and above. This has prompted thousands of running books some by new runners who consider their own few marathons are a big deal. To them it may be the pinnacle of their sporting prowess, but their books are usually mundane and in truth boring. This does not apply to `Born to run' It's a rip-roaring running adventure story. It also has the guts to attack the way some big running shoe retailer's use so called `science' to sell expensive running shoes to us that could damage our feet.

No glue, no scratches, everything that should be in the box is in the box.  Just a note on the remastering. This is the best version so far but take that with a grain of salt. Layla was never a great recording to begin with. The bonus tracks are well worth it and so is the expanded version of In Concert.     So 5 stars for music, 4 stars for extras and 0 for packaging.

0743496736|4.0|Jodi Picoult once said Handle With Care was the saddest book she wrote.  I disagree, as a tragedy of epic portions, such as the one displayed in Nineteen Minutes, can bring little justice or resolution to anyone, making its impact far more sad.  And with the possible exception of Detective Patrick Ducharme, who was granted a second chance at love, there was little room for happiness as Picoult's characters, as well as her readers, are forced to come to terms with the fact that life is not fair.  It's not fair that some crimes go unnoticed while others generate overwhelming public sympathy for those we'll never know - and probably wouldn't want to know.  It's not fair that bullying is continually ignored by authorities while popularity - no matter what the price - is continually cherished by adolescence.  And it's not fair that some people get away with the most despicable acts while others are punished every day just for being who they are.  But the most unnerving thing about this novel is that the most likeable character, with the possible exception of Detective Ducharme once again, is the killer Peter Houghton, who in nineteen minutes sealed the fate of what he knew to be his life.  He was more likeable than his self-centered, immature, and whiny former best friend, his caring but out of touch parents, and the judge who once thought she was too objective to have to remove herself from a case that no doubt affected her daughter.  And Peter was definitely more likeable than his targeted victims.  Unlike Picoult's other stories involving a rare disease or situation that fortunately the average family doesn't have to deal with, most people who ever went to grade school can relate to Peter Houghton.  The fact that most of us have or would have sought a different form of resolution doesn't affect our ability to relate; however, Peter's jury is one I would not have wanted to rule on.  While fictional, this novel parallels real-life events leading to school shootings, although it contains enough suspense to make this a good read and not like some gruesome, factual reporting.  But for many, it also leads to childhood memories, making this more of a story that needs to be told rather than one of pure entertainment.

B004KSQN7C|4.0|Besides the first two released songs which are both great, I don't really like any of the other songs so much that I have to listen to any of them individually, but they are definitely good. I can listen to this entire album repeatedly so 4 stars. On \\"Big Fat Bass,\\" it's so obviously a Black Eyed Peas song, that I can't help but want Fergie singing this song or even Rihanna as I think it needs harder vocals, but I am liking Britney's version more as I listen to it. Overall, great job, Britney. Still at the top.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is an artist with words.  He is a word-craft master and I just love his books.  A description of silence? Brilliant.  The only thing I will warn people about is that the series is not finished so be prepared to wait for many years for the conclusion of Kvothe's story.  In the meantime, I will be rereading the first two books to bask in the glory that is Patrick Rothfuss
1932100660|3.0|It took about 3 or 4 weeks for this to arrive as a gift....  Needless to say, very late  (so says the receipitant.)
B00007GZQI|1.0|i have to say this movie is a colossal mess.  ringo is a dope, sellers is ok, but there is no plot... i guess social satire somewhere hidden under the rug.  a real clueless early 70s spin... off
0525423273|5.0|YA is not my typical genre.  I reluctantly read the book because my sister gave it to me and recommended it.  I was definately skeptical to begin with.  It did not take long - 2nd page maybe - before I was engrossed in Anna's story and how it would pan out. The cover and the synopsis that it's a senior in Paris does not draw me in so the fact that I love this book despite by reluctance says something about this author.  She had me believing in Anna and her friends. She even had me believing in Paris.  This had so many elements that I didn't particularly care about and now I can't put it down.  I just read this story over and over and I am astounded at the genius of Stephanie's writing that she can compel me to love all the elements of this book that was the same elements that I didn't think I liked.    As for the story itself, the genius is displayed in the style of Stephanie's writing. Her writing is hilarious, insightful, and poignant. I love that this story is about a hard earned love between the characters. The surrounding characters are great, the description of Paris makes you feel like you could be there with them, and the intimacy of the friendship of the characters make you want to root for them in any capacity she lets you. This is definitely A MUST READ and I felt compelled to share my (surprising) love for this book.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The penultimate Potter film is the best by far, and I suspect when married to it's forthcoming second part will become one of the truly epic fantasy films. Stunning visuals and effects, and it's wonderful to see three once child actors now fine young adult actors. The measured pace is a far more mature attitude to story-telling than other recent whiz-bang ADD editing styles. Highly recommended, although you really do need to see the previous films to have any idea of what it is all about.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I didn't see Burlesque in the theatre, but I did purchase it because of the trailer. I love musicals, and I enjoy Cher and Christina Aquilara! This movie had the best of everything, great music, dancing, and even a sweet romance! After I watched the movie I immediately bought the soundtrack, and it hasn't left my car! I constantly have it on repeat! I love all the songs on the soundtrack, but my favorite song is Bound to You by Christina Aguilara! I highly highly recommend this movie for anyone that wants to have a good time and enjoy a movie that will make you want to get up on your feet and DANCE!!!!!!!
B003C1QIO6|5.0|If you like Jack Johnson, this is his best album.  Some fun, some mellow, his voice whispers tranquility.  Well worth the money!
B004J4WQ46|4.0|The Strokes are one of those bands that have been held up as 'saviors' for so long that it's hard to believe that their total output for a decade is a mere four albums. \\"Angles\\" is the first time that they've - in my opinion - lived up to the hype of the first album. It doesn't sound like a knock-off (the reason my review of \\"Room on Fire\\" was two stars), and sounds more committed than \\"First Impressions\\" did. They've re-embraced pop structure, and Julian Casablancas' singing is at a new peak. Even the first single, \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\" breezed by with an easy charm.<br /><br />Maybe it was the near five year break that motivated them, but \\"Angles\\" has that cool-band buzziness back. The punk urgency of \\"You're So Right\\" recaptures the CBGB rawness of the earlier days, while the new-wave \\"Two Kinds of Happiness\\" and \\"Games\\" take their cues from the chittering work The Cars were so perfect at. At the same time, the experimentation that made \\"First Impressions\\" sound listless is tightened up for \\"Gratisfaction\\" (best Strokes song ever?) and the moody, \\"Call Me Back.\\" So maybe \\"First Impressions of Earth\\" wasn't as much a backslide as I first thought.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Angles\\" is what \\"Is This It\\" originally promised from The Strokes. They had, at the beginning both attitude and ambition to burn. Casablancasa was as blatant an anti-star as the year had turned out, with all the attractiveness that would imply. The snarling twin guitars and snapping rhythm section are as tight now as they were then, and \\"Angles\\" is the sound of a band, while not making a masterpiece, still on solid footing.
B001DEAAIY|5.0|I bought Band of Brothers to share with my Son who was having trouble understanding the mixed feelings our family (and most families) have with the violent 1st person shooter video games he and his adolescent friends price so highly (eg Modern Warfare - Black Ops).  He had recently read Under War Torn Skies by Laura Elliot which is a fairly realistic book (historical fiction) about a young American bomber pilot who was shot down over enemy lines in occupied France near the German and Swiss boarder. He was very impressed by this book (and I was surprised to find that it was recommended reading for middle school students given the semi-mature subject matter) but I new I had a chance to do some real educating to put both the historical setting of that book and the violent nature and costs of war into some greater perspective for him.  He usually resists anything I recommend but here we were able to do some very important sharing about what it means to be a man, to be a soldier, and in some ways to be an American.    Suffice it to say, my instincts were correct.  Obviously he enjoyed it, we bonded, and he now has a whole lot to think about with regards to violence, war, military service, heroism, humanity, inhumanity, pain, love, comradery and loss.  I have found yet another way to respect and admire both the real people who fought in the war and the people who saw to it that the series was made as perfectly as it is.  Tom hanks may have a bunch of Oscars and SNL appearances, but getting this made is the greatest thing he has ever done in his career.     That being said, I should probably comment on my choice to by the series in Blue Ray rather than DVD.  On our current set (a 60\\" 720p rear projection set and a 6.1 audio system with full sized speakers) there isn't a tremendous amount of difference in picture and sound quality between BD and DVD.  However I wasn't willing to risk feeling later that I might have missed something by going with DVD, even though in that format I would be able to loan the disks out to more of my family.  My favorite part of this release has been the pop-up commentary mode where you not only hear, but see the surviving easy company members talking about there experiences related to the part of the story playing in the background.  These pop-up interview segments are timed so that you don't miss any significant action or dialog, but you do learn a lot more of the background and specific circumstances surrounding the action.  I find it also helps in identifying who is who among the survivors in that the pop-up are captioned with their names whereas the prologue interview sections for each episode usually don't identify the individual speakers.  This was a nice addition to the experience I have had watching the series as it is played on HBO.    So I can't recommend this highly enough.  It's a classic and this is the best format you can get it in.
B004FOA84A|3.0|i love these types of games but this one was just way too short. the graphics were great and the story line wasnt to bad. just wish it was longer
B004PGO25O|5.0|Steven did not look to write the exhaustive step-by-step here, if you want that, read this and then go read his \\"The Art of War\\" after. The problem with many books is they drowned you in each chapter and by the end you have forgot the beginning and the middle - how do you ship to that? This is balanced - dive to detail sometimes, but keeping it at a higher level. The precept is correct - resistance is ugly. I'm a Tony Robbins user (Get the Edge - We will do far more to avoid pain than we will do to gain pleasure) and if you put GTE, Do the Work and Poke the Box side-by-side the message should bang on your head like the bell falling off the tower (the Navy Seals' bell if you have not read the book yet).  This is a great starting place, restarting, or a getting unstuck place. And never ring the bell!
B0035J6TA8|4.0|Peter Gabriel, well-known for his progressive pop solo career and early Genesis has put out an album of cover songs that all sound totally different from the originals that this effort stands mostly on it's own creative merits.       I was expecting a guitar/drums/keyboard style production similar to his albums such as So or Us; however, the meat of this album was produced with a classical orchestra backing---this is similar to when XTC put out Apple Venus Vol. 1 with violins galore: not what their usual fans expected.       Peter's dramatic vocalizations still shine through as well as pop sensibilities built into the covered material to make this album worth purchasing if you are a big fan.
0802130208|1.0|Years ago, I listened to a group of people at a local bookstore talk about Confederacy of Dunces in glowing terms.  I later picked up a copy at the library expecting much hilarity.  It was horrible.  I couldn't bring myself to finish it.<br /><br />Roll forward a few years.  I thought that maybe my tastes had changed and the book deserved a second chance.  No joy.  I found nothing funny about the book.  It is just one inane situation after another, no ups or downs, just an anemic \\"plot\\" that droned on and on.<br /><br />Is the fondness for this book an elaborate and widespread joke?  Maybe it is a story that people pretend to like because others do, sort of an \\"Emperor's New Cloths\\" thing.  I don't know but I found NOTHING to like in this book.
030746363X|5.0|Tim's book is a breath of fresh air.  Amongst landslides of free information now being thrown at us from every direction on the likes of facebook, twitter, and every other source its wonderful to find an all inclusive book that treats the reader like an intelligent adult.  Tim gives you the lay of the land without spoon-feeding you. Here's the real news though: I'm a coach for a cross-country ski club and having applied some of Tim's principles my athletes made unheard of improvements. One of them won a NATIONAL TITLE and wasn't even a competitive athlete a year ago.  Thanks Tim, from all of us.
0061537969|5.0|Sigh......the good, sigh of finishing an excellent book.  I just finished THE ART OF RACING IN THE RAIN by Garth Stein.  A fast read, this story is told from the point of view of a dog and it is really WELL done.  Even if you aren't a \\"dog person\\" you will enjoy this story.  The man in the story is a racecar driver and, although that isn't my \\"thing\\" I really enjoyed the book.  The author is very adept at blending the perceptions of the dog and his human family, their trials, their triumphs and the art of professional racing.  Like all good books, you come to really feel like you know the characters.
B000GH2YPG|4.0|I enjoyed the book, and it kept me guessing.  But - did they live happily ever after?  And what happened to Mrs. Danvers?
B004L03B3S|5.0|This Brazilian drama will leave nobody indifferent. It doesn't happen everyday that we can watch such a controversial, yet interesting story.<br />Aluisio Abranches did a great job as a director. His picture is sublime. I watched it without taking break etc.<br />But there is one thing that bothered me a bit.<br />Maybe it is the way he led the actors and action, but his potray of brothers' love seems to be pure and natural (as if there was nobody around Thomas and Francisco who found their relationship at least \\"not propriate\\"). Even parents don't react (well, a small talk between divorced parents doesn't count). But it's then, when mother says that very important sentence, which could be the bottom line of the whole film.<br />Watch yourself and find it.<br />Moreover, the ending itself left a little marigin of doubt. A small question mark, so visible on Thomas' face...Was it meant to be there? Did the director want to tell us something?<br />We will never know that.<br />To sum up:<br />Acting (both young and older actors) is magnificent, beautiful soundtrack suits the action very well. Don't miss this one!
0140072187|5.0|This book was lent to me by an aircraft mechanic (thanks, Mike).      I was only a little too young to go to Vietnam, but my returning upperclassmen brought back stories - scary stories.  I became old enough for the draft immediately AFTER they stopped it.  As a result of the stories I heard, I avoided books about Vietnam.  When this one was lent to me with a glowing recommendation, I was doubtful.  I was wrong.    Robert Mason is an honest writer, with a talent for stating life threatening situations in a matter-of-fact, happens-every-day, form.  He talks honestly of his successes and failures, his incredible skill and incredible luck, his fellow crewmen and airmen, in such a descriptive way - you can smell the canvas tents, hear the sniper fire and feel the nightmares.    I am a pilot, over 19,000 hours at last count, and while reading this book, I started to sweat.  There are situations that scare pilots, and the Vietnam helicopter pilots lived, and died, in all of them, inventing new ones every day.  This book has now been re-lent, to another pilot, and another copy bought for a friend.    No aviation bookshelf should be without this book!
B0034G4OXQ|5.0|I have been trying to figure out why this film got so many bad reviews, and I think it really just comes down to subject matter. One of the characters in the movie is a journalist who has a near-death experience in the Indonesian tsunami, and then starts to probe research on near-death experiences, and comes to believe there is a conspiracy against the material getting out. I don't know if there's a conspiracy, but certainly very few people really want to contemplate death in the way this film does. It is not light and fluffy. And although it does posit the idea that there is something more for us after death, it doesn't offer an idea of what that might be. In other words, it refuses to give us a superficial, heart-warming, or comforting dogma to take home with us. It probes people's experiences with death and the other side, including in the form of a reluctant psychic played by Matt Damon, and it probes human suffering, but it doesn't necessarily give us a dimestore happy ending.<br /><br />I have to admit, after the first 20 minutes or so of the film, I wasn't sure I wanted to go on. It is sad, the characters suffer, and they are sad. But I'm so glad I continued to watch, because there is a richness and truth to what they go through, and the individual seeking they each embark upon, which brings them all together in a beautiful way in the end. I also felt the performances and special effects were all excellent.<br /><br />So no, it is not your typical feel-good movie, nor even your typical paranormal sci-fi type movie. It is a spiritual human drama, and if you are willing to stick with it, I think it is well worth the journey it takes you on.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Just a superb movie all around. The yard stick by with I measure all other animation. The only down side I have found is than it makes me long for a full movie version of the entire manga.
B004KA9MQO|5.0|From the moment I heard her sing on the Dreamgirls soundtrack I was blown away by this amazing talent. Jennifer Hudson truly was the star in that movie and on the soundtrack even more so. So, when her debut album hit the stores I was very excited. It had been quite a long wait, but you know when Clive Davis does something, he wants to do it right. Always looking for the best material. And although the debut had a bunch of amazing songs, it lacked something. I didn't feel like it was very personal, nor cohesive. Yet almost every track was pretty strong on its own.    Now, JHud returned with her sophomore album and it is everything I hoped it would be. It feels like she really put much more of herself into it and as if she is really sharing her life with us. Even though not all of the songs might actually be inspired by her own experience. Moreover, it's well produced and a unity, while maintaining the same high level of diversity that her marked first album. Every song is a stand out track and not one disappoints.    Jennifer worked with some of the greatest talents in pop-soul and R&B. Angel, Don't Look Down and Everybody Needs love are clearly penned by Alicia Keys. They would have fit right in on her last album The Element of Freedom, which is also one of the better albums of recent times. But Jennifer Hudson has that voice, that unique sound and style that can turn any song into her own. We've seen her doing many tributes over the years, to Michael Jackson, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. She never fails to surprise us with her rendition and she knows how to deliver. Also think back to her Superbowl performance of the Star Spangled Banner in 2009. The best since Whitney's in 1991.    The opening of the album is very strong with funky dancetunes I Got This and No One's Gonna Love You, while R. Kelly once again proves his writing skills with Where You At. This lead single is one of the more dramatic songs, showing of her vocal power. While some of the artistswith a similar vocal power might be overusing that talent, JHud knows how to hold back, adding to the strength of a song, for example on Still Here (written by ballad diva Diane Warren) and Why Is It So Hard.    I'm Feeling Good is a great climax towards the end of the album. The song has been sung many times before but rarely as funky as now. Finally, Hudson calms us down again with the (mandatory) gospel track I Believe, which is really one of the strongest cuts on I Remember Me. She knows how to tell the story and even after hearing it many times it is still an emotional experience which might even appeal to non-believers. No doubt many gospel lovers will agree that one day, she should do an entire traditional gospel album. She'll surely convert some people with that.    Clearly, Jennifer Hudson progressed as a human being, a singer and an artist and she's only getting started. I can barely wait to see what she'll do next, but until then, I will enjoy I Remember Me!    *Thanks to Amazon, by the way, for shipping to Europe, so I didn't have to wait another month for this album. Now, here's hoping JHud will do some concerts here too!
B002ELM5HY|5.0|If you're wanting to hear what Eric Clapton once referred to as \\"maestro bull****,\\" go back and listen to \\"Telegraph Road\\" on the Dire Straits album LOVE OVER GOLD.  If you want genius songwriting and some of the most passionate guitar playing on Earth (hint: listen to what this man, like Louis Armstrong, can do with ONE note, while most guitarists play 1,000 that have no feeling in them whatsoever), this album is for you.  It's among the best work Knopfler's ever done--and I have IT ALL.  Instead of listening to music with a preconcieved bias, listen with an open mind, and hear WHAT'S THERE, don't hope for what isn't.  Knopfler has made it abundantly clear that Dire Straits is behind him.  He's been there and done that, and it was fabulous.  He's now a mature artist whose guitar soloing SUPPORTS his songs--it doesn't pull the listener away from the lyrics, which after all, is the songwriter's mode of storytelling.  Ever since Sinatra, we've known that the singer or musician needs to make conveying the meaning of the song the most important aspect of a performance, not endless grandstanding by overdoing things with bombastic arrangements and endless soloing (hint: most pop and rock music).  \\"Cleaning My Gun\\" is Knopfler at his lyrical best, and the Scottish-influenced songs are the most organic he's ever done, the moving, melodic guitar brilliantly combined with the traditional instruments (a bit like Martin Barre's excellent work with Jethro Tull in 1977-79, but even more heartfelt).
B003K1EYM6|5.0|When considering the purchase of my iPad 2, I had two requirements.  I needed to take notes for college, and download images directly from my Canon EOS 7D DSLR while in the field.  Each task could be achieved, but required purchasing additional tools.  The Apple iPad camera connection kit is a necessary accessory for transferring images directly to an iPad 2.<br /><br />The kit includes two adapters, an SD card and a USB, which plug into the iPad's 30-pin connector charging slot.  The small white adapters, only available in a kit, should easily fit in practically any camera bag setup.<br /><br />Being required to purchase both the SD card and USB adapters as a set seems like a waste of money.  As a Canon EOS DSLR user, the SD card adapter is useless to me.  Fortunately I have a friend who only needed the SD card adapter.<br /><br />To transfer my images, I connected my Canon EOS DSLR to the adapter using a USB cable.  The iPad 2 recognized my camera and opened the photo album to show image thumbnails from my RAW files.  I could select to transfer all images, or check certain ones.  Once the images I wanted transferred, I was asked if I wanted to delete them from the camera.  Images can be downloaded multiple times without overwriting any images on the iPad.  Additionally, I could select images to delete from the camera, or opt to delete them all with the click of a button.<br /><br />If you are looking to transfer images directly from your camera to your iPad, the Apple iPad camera connection kit's USB adapter will get the job done.  The SD card reader works just as nicely, making this a worthy purchase.  However if you only need one adapter, locate a friend who could use the other adapter to purchase the kit with you.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Small and simple to use<br />Transfer images directly from camera to iPad<br />Plays well with Canon EOS cameras.  (probably other brands too)<br /><br />CONS:<br />Adapters only come as a kit
B003YBUSMW|5.0|It is a great racing wheel. Well build and aesthetically pleasing. Very responsive and well worth the money. At this price range there are not a lot of options so this this wheel has no competition.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Watched it at movies and wanted to own a copy when it came out in DVD.  Cher and Christina did a terrific job.  I loved the dancing/singing and comedy.  Stanley Tucci was doing his \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" character and was great, as he always is to me.
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I just got this for my new camera, and it holds so many more pictures than my previous memory card.  I can fit 700 pictures on this card.  My only complaint is that it does take quite a bit of time to transfer files, but I can live with it, and it does seem to drain the battery.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Great storyline, characters, music! Its been a long time since every aspect of a movie was spot on. The same goes for the first installment, Ip Man!!!    A definite MUST-SEE!

1577314808|5.0|The book I purchased recently was for a friend.  I've had my own copy for a year or two, and it's what I turn to every time I'm having a hard time in my life.  I read the entire book and highlighted the parts that really stood out to me, and I read those every time I needed some quick \\"help\\".  Then a guy I worked with suggested (he also knew the book well) that I read the entire book again with a different colored highlighter in hand.  Sure enough, there was more that time!  Now I flip through the book and read the highlighted parts and, no matter what page it is, I instantly start feeling better as soon as I start to read.  This is the most amazing book to me, and I highly recommend it to everyone!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My sister suggested I read this book after she read it. Her daughter was reading it in her 5th grade classroom and when her daughter described the book (by description it sounds inappropriate) to her she thought she should check it out. She loved it and passed it on to me. It is an AWESOME book. Though provoking and page-turning. I could not put it down and went out instantly to get the next two. SO GOOD!
030746363X|5.0|I can't speak highly enough about Tim's book, the 4-Hour Body. It has helped me tremendously in shaping a, not a diet, but an eating lifestyle that has absolutely been the reason I'm down 40lbs in 4 months, and still eating things I love day in a day out with the weekly cheat day keeping me from temptation day after day. Seriously, this book is amazing, easy to follow diet, well written, backed up with tests and daily trials from the author himself. No filler here, if it didn't work for Tim he didn't put it in here. EDIT: Exactly one year after I started this diet and I am still going strong. I am down a total of 65lbs and I am in the gym everyday now doing cardio mixed with lifting weights. I feel great, feel healthy, and feel much more motivated now than ever. I cannot recommend this book enough. Still the easiest diet I have ever been on.  Edit: OK, Today is 05/07/2013, I have lost a total of 160lbs, 150lbs of that coming directly from the 4HB. You can see m,y progress so far and progress forward on my personal blog, [...] I am still following the 4 Hour Body in loose form. I have added a few more carbs such as sweet potatoes and quinoa and have started lifting weights regularly. This book even after two and half years stills proves to be an unbelievable resource for not just my diet but for many aspects on my life. I have moved into more chapters and have started to use the methods mentioned by Tim and noticing huge improvements again. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this book and put it to good use.  EDIT: 10/23/2014 I still cannot say enough about this book and have recommended it since I read it. I lost 160lbs and still have it all off to this day. I constantly go through this book still marking it all up and trying new things and going back to try old things again. You can see all of my progress and current steps I am taking here, www.4hourjourney.com and instagram.com/4hourjourney  EDIT: 04/30/2015 Still following a loose form of this diet successfully. I love this diet and the book. It works, bottom line. I question the actual diet following of the people who say this does not work.  For me the diet works perfect, I eat healthy six days a week then I get one cheat day. I skip more cheat days now but that is on purpose with my weight lifting goals I have in place.
0439023521|5.0|I was in the book store, trying to find another series to read and I saw this book. After reading the back cover, I wasn't sure about buying it. I decided to go ahead and get it. I am extremely glad I did. It has got a great story line. I had a hard time putting it down. I can't wait to ready the next one.
0061726826|4.0|I love a good dystopian novel, and Delirium fit all the right criteria. More than anything, the idea of love as a mental condition fascinated me. The protagonist's growing awareness of oppression and willingness to buck the oppressive society made me cheer in solidarity; the beautiful emotions that gradually developed and then ruled the lives of the youth brought me joy and tears. The ending definitely left me wanting more.

020530902X|1.0|The problem with S+W's Elements is that it is just plain wrong a lot of the time. Consider the passive. Of 4 examples given in the text as \\"passive\\" constructions to be avoided, only 1 of the 4 actually contains a passive.<br /><br />1.\\"At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard\\"<br />Correctly identified as a passive.<br /><br />2.\\"There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground\\"<br />Not passive, merely a existential use of the copula. Try it in the present tense and see if you still think it is passive: \\"There are a great number of dead leaves...\\" or more colloquially: \\"There are a lot of dead leaves on the ground.\\"<br /><br />3.\\"It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had\\"<br />Not passive, for this to be passive 'she' would have to be the object of a transitive verb... none in sight.<br /><br />4.\\"The reason that he left college was that his health became impaired\\"<br />Not passive, merely linking 'reason' with 'that his health became impaired.' Impaired is an adjective not a verb here so it isn't passive either.<br /><br />Furthermore sentences deployed throughout the book such as \\"The subject of a sentence and the principal verb should not, as a rule, be separated by a phrase or clause that can be transferred to the beginning.\\" routinely violate numerous rules set out by the book. Here a passive is used, related words aren't kept together, and the subject is separated from the main verb by a phrase that could easily have been moved to the start of the sentence. That's three strikes.<br /><br />A requisite for writing a style guide should be the ability to follow your own rules and sufficient knowledge of the subject to correctly identify [NOT 'correctly to identify'] the constructions you are discussing.<br /><br />When it comes to grammar this book is a golden calf, not the 10 commandments.
B000003TA4|4.0|Note: The album does contain a few curse words (specifically In Bloom and Lounge Act) so be mindful when playing this around children.    Nirvana's Nevermind has much more gloss and sheen in comparison to their previous Bleach and future In Utero.  While Kurt may have hated the production, the production helps emphasize the strengths of the songs more often than not.    With that said, the album itself is not perfect although it should be considered a strong addition to any collection.    01 Smells Like Teen Spirit: While it has definitely become overplayed and is a rip off of The Pixies (admitted as much by Cobain), the guitar riff is one of the most memorable that Kurt ever applied to a song.  The drums manage to create a sense of urgency to the track and Kurt's vocals manage to stand out for their underrated sense of melody even with the screamed choruses.    02 In Bloom: Memorable contribution from Krist's bass is seen here and a much poppier guitar sound accompanies.  The vocals suit Kurt much better and the song arguably is one of the band's best overall.    03 Come As You Are: Another song weighed heavily on Krist's bass line, a feature of the band often under remarked upon. While another rip off (a Killing Joke song), it is mostly memorable for the watery feel of the bass and guitar.  Probably the weakest of the hit songs in my eyes although the lyrics match up well to Kurt's other compositions.    04 Breed: One of the songs on the album that best represented Kurt's idea of what he wanted Nirvana to sound like. Punk sound with the heavily distorted guitar, fast drum tempo, and repetitive lyrics coupled with a very catchy chorus.  The song that is likely most representative of what was to come with In Utero.    05 Lithium: Another mellow song carried by a memorable bass riff from Krist. Very similar to In Bloom in that Kurt had a real knack for coming up with mid tempo songs that fit his vocals really well. Dave's drumming on this track again adds a sense ofurgency when it kicks into high gear.    06 Polly: Haunting for the lyrical content although overall, the song does not stand up in comparison to some of the other tracks on the album. The acoustic guitar stands out, especially given when the album was released, but Nirvana would go on to compile better acoustic songs on In Utero and their performance on MTV's Unplugged.    07 Territorial Pissings: One of Nirvana's purest punk songs both in attitude and production. The inclusion hurts it a bit as it seems out of place overall on the album and feels like it would have been a better fit on Incesticide.    08 Drain You: Reportedly one of Kurt's favorite songs and it is easy to see why. Up there with In Bloom as one of the standout tracks that the band put out and a real highlight of the album. The bass guitar and lyrics are some of the best that Krist and Kurt ever came up with.    09 Lounge Act: A personal favorite. A memorable jangly riff with a bit of a punk undertone threatening to break at any point. One of Kurt's best vocal performances ever and the way he pushes himself towards the end is spine chilling.    10 Stay Away: Somewhat overlooked track but very similar in relation to Breed. The guitar riff and drums stand out but the lyrical content is not nearly as strong and the song itself feels like a retread of the much better Breed featured earlier. Another track that feels almost out of place on the album in comparison to the tracks around it.    11 On A Plain: An often overlooked gem that again compares very favorably to songs like In Bloom and Drain You. One of Kurt's more memorable choruses and Krist's bass stands out as well. One of the top tracks on the album.    12 Something In the Way: A slightly better acoustic effort from Kurt with whispered vocals that make the song stand out more than it would have if performed with an electric guitar. The mood and atmosphere of the song are haunting, especially with the cello inclusion, although the drums seem out of place and detract a bit. Good song but it seems to just be missing something to push it over the top.
030746363X|5.0|I was very skeptical of this book when I first read the review of it and even more skeptical when I read the user reviews as they were too good to be true and there were too many positive ones that it had to be a trick.  I have been an active person most of my life and I work out hard (burn 800-1,000 calories per 1 hr workout) 5-7 days a week.  I eat pretty healthy but I have always been stumped at my inability to lose those final pounds.  I could crank up my intensity, I could cut out weight lifting and only do cardio, I could only do strength training with no cardio, you name it, I tried it and it had little change to my body.      I don't believe in most diets as they are too extreme, aren't sustainable and usually make you feel like crap.  That said I knew my problem had to be with my diet (even though I eat pretty healthy) so I gave this book a try.  Within the first 4 days of being on the slow carb diet I lost 5 pounds and I had more energy than I have had in a very long time.  So I was hooked right out of the gate.  It's been about a month now and I am following the diet about 70% right.  I have lost just under 20 pounds and my body fat has improved over 30%!  I actually have definition in my abs which I have never had and can't recall looking this good in my 42 years of living.  The key takeaways for me are as follows: I love the meals I eat so it isn't painful at all; I have almost too much energy; make sure you follow the supplement routine that Tim suggests; it's no longer a diet that I am on....it's how I will eat for the rest of my life (for the most part).    Everyone I have put on the diet has the same amazing results so it isn't just me.  I thought my wife would be jazzed with her hubby's new physique and out bragging about it, but all I hear her telling her friends is \\"the book is pretty amazing....I wonder when he is going to read the sex chapter\\"....ouch!!!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|I thing the graphics in this movie were absolutely amazing. I loved the lights on the people and the vehicles and that the rooms were dark, it just illuminated the lights to be even brighter. I loved the plot line. It was hard for me to understand as I usually don't watch this type of movie, but my fiance' explained to me what was going on and then I understood very well. Then I loved the plot of what was going on. It is hard to understand what was going on if you don't watch this type of movie generally, but if you are used to this type of movie you will love this movie. Definitely worth the money!

1934030597|4.0|As someone fairly new to mountain biking, it's great to have the advice of an experienced hand in maintaining your mount. Will pay for itself the first time I do a tuneup.     Unlike one reviewer who complained about the use of illustrations, I think they are far clearer than the typical muddy black & white photos you often see in books of this type.
B000002NXZ|4.0|I'm rating this four stars because of the quality of the recording and because it's Tom Petty, but as for my personal enjoyment, it's not near that.<br /><br />I've had this cassette languishing on my shelf for decades but in an effort to get rid of obsolete technology, I burned it to CD and had the chance to give it a fresh listen.<br /><br />I've always been a great admirer of Tom Petty and the same goes for the band, the Heartbreakers. They are great musicians and personalities. Mr. Petty gets a soft spot for me because he is also a bit of an actor and has at least a passing interest in amateur astronomy. In fact there was one time a few years ago it was rumored he was going to join a few of us here in Las Vegas for a star party, but it never happened and might have been nothing more than a rumor propagated by one of our members. Whatever the case, I would have enjoyed chatting with him.<br /><br />When it comes to his music, I may get hate mail for this, but though it can be good, it just doesn't excite me. It is not bad, it just doesn't rock my boat. That is the case here with this album. It starts out with The Waiting, which I've heard so many times on the radio (at least 100,000) that I can recognize it after just two notes. Skipping to the rest of the album, I only found one song that really sparked my interest and that was Nightwatchman. The quirky guitar track caught my attention and was worth going back to several times. However, none of the rest of the songs came off as particularly memorable to me. To be fair, I usually go for heavier music. Mr. Petty's laid back style is just a bit too laid back for me.<br /><br />What I like about it is the outstanding production, the way he and Mr. Campbell use their guitars to create that (sort of) jangly wall of sound that is unique to his style. When you hear one of his songs, there is no mistaking it's Tom Petty, even without the vocals.<br /><br />I have several of his albums and this rates right up with them. Nothing wrong with that. For Tom Petty fans, I highly recommend this. It's just not my thing.ns, I highly recommend this. It's just not my thing.

1594202842|4.0|I devoured this book in just one night and I was laughing out loud the entire time. I'm in no way a \\"Tiger Mom,\\" but I appreciate the values of hard work, delayed gratification and inner strength that Chua stresses, and I think this book is a refreshing (although extreme) contrast to much of today's everyone's-a-winner approach to parenting. In no way did I interpret this as a how-to guide -- she makes it very clear that her approach was not always successful and questions some her actions at the end. Rather, it's autobiographical entertainment and just one woman's animated attempt at a mommy memoir. Take from it what you will... just don't take it so seriously. With a title like that, you know she's painting a one-sided and over-the-top picture of her life as a mom.
B002RKSZKI|4.0|It's not my favorite, but I was still struck by how Austen knows the human heart so well.  During the first part of the book, I wanted to spank Emma Woodhouse on several occasions.  She was annoying, exasperating, conceited, arrogant, and so sure of herself that is was hard to read about her.  However, underneath all that, Emma is really a kind, good, generous person.  She treats her father with such tenderness and concern; that was a beautiful thing.    But, I know women like her and when they discover their faults, they are full of recrimination.  I just loved Austen's insight into women and their natures.  Some of the characters are so real, so rich; Mrs. Elton, Miss Bates.  But, I'm not sure there is someone as saintly and good and patient as Mr. Knightley; he was just not totally believable to me.    However, over all, I enjoyed this book.  I think Jane Austen is a remarkable writer; verbose, yes, but perhaps that is the way people talked then.  At any rate, Emma is a book to read and enjoy if you like period literature!

So, must mean they're \\"commercial\\" right?    Well they probably are. If they wanted to prove they're not commercial, they could write a 20-minute symphony featuring backward Tibetan Chanting, organ solos with names like 'the incontinent rabbit who cuddled caring cactus \\"part 82\\"' and the cover would be of an open field, with a big, purple sky. And, if they really were commercial they'd write sappy ballads with lyrics like 'And Babe I love you' and 'It's the first time for love', and everyone who was around in '78 knew Styx would NEVER do that.     Instead, they made powerfully sung arena-rock anthems, that were catchy and were adorned with colourful organs and synths. And they kinda made up for the lack of, you know, 80-minute symphonies, with an eerie aura that oversees the whole thing. Styx were masters of aura and they were at their peak with 'Pieces of Eight'.

B001KZVQJI|4.0|AWESOME KONG!! more than a movie this is an experience! The acting is what really kept me in awe. Now, im not saying this is shakespearean stuff or anything like that. NO. the thing is that i went to see this movie with my expectations a tad low. I mean Jack Black? when in the world would you expect good acting from him (and his role was pivotal) but it was such a surprise to see him become the role. it was great. Naomi Watts was great. Adrien Brody (although i dont like him at all) was great as well. Supporting cast was spot on.    Yeah the movie is long, but for filmmaking like this is what going to the movies is all about.    Bummer on the extras department. NOTHING!    my recommendation... buy it! dont think. Buy it! every decent collection should have peter jackson in it.

B003Y58CKS|3.0|Rigoletto is a great opera.  Its greatness relies, essentially, on two simple ingredients:  Victor Hugo's tragic story (\\"Le Roi s'amuse\\"), and Verdi's gorgeous music.  It's too bad that so many stage directors feel compelled to toy with that powerful formula:  whether it's the costuming of the jester, or in this case, a production that takes the meat-and-potatoes tragedy and twists it into a lemon meringue travesty.<br /><br />First the pluses, and they are huge pluses.  The singing by the central trio and the chorus is, as most reviewers have pointed out, outstanding.  It is highlighted by the pure tone of Diana Damrau, whose beautiful voice is capable of handling any of the score's challenges.  The Serbian baritone, Zeljko Lucic, makes for a formidable Rigoletto, and Juan Diego Florez's bright tenor voice, soars brilliantly, and enthusiastically, up to the house \\"gods.\\"  The conductor, Fabio Luisi, also manages to elicit a forceful and spirited Verdian sound from the Dresden Staatskapelle.<br /><br />Sadly, the rest of the production's variables are quite uneven.  Sometimes, the sets lend an appropriate context to the performance (e.g., Act II, the Duke's palace), and at other times, they raise more questions than answers (e.g., Act I, the blue bedroom cubicle).<br /><br />Some stage directors, including certainly Nikolaus Lehnhoff, seem to want to make sure that they're noticed, and in behalf of bringing a new, or unique, slant to a production, their creative impulse leads them to this or that idiosyncratic interpretation of a particular scene that might make some sense to a few initiates, but ends up, for the most part, distracting from the performance, rather than complementing it.  The conspicuous nudity in Act I, for example, is going to get our attention, but is it really necessary.  The sterile blue bedroom cubicle in the 2nd half of Act I is sufficiently unusual as to get our attention, but it seems more a lingering distraction than performance-enhancing.  And the perplexing  embrace of the Duke with Gilda during the opera's signature quartet in Act III is another example of an attention-grabbing absurdity.<br /><br />Other problems exist with some of the acting.  Lucic, especially, directs too much of his attention to the audience, instead of his daughter, during a couple of their poignant duets together.  When, in the course of Rigoletto's forceful ode to vengeance at the conclusion of Act II, for example, Gilda sings, \\"O mio padre, what a fierce joy flashes in your eyes,\\" their lack of dramatic coordination is all too evident, because she never could have seen his eyes, ... she is backstage, and he is front, facing the audience the whole time.<br /><br />There may not be many better singing performances of this opera, but for dvds, my preference would be the Carlos Alvarez, Rigoletto (at Barcelona), with Inva Mula and Marcelo Alvarez as the Duke, although the jester's rubber suit that Carlos Alvarez has to wear was poorly conceived.  My 2nd choice would be Leo Nucci's Rigoletto at Verona with Mula and Aquiles Machado as the Duke; the production values at Verona are quite satisfactory, even though they had to be particularly challenging given that this open air venue seats 20,000.<br /><br />[It is worth noting that the picture and sound of this Lucic Rigoletto are of a high quality, although it is also worth noting that the Amazon product details contain a number of errors.  For one, the production's aspect ratio is widescreen (1.77:1), and not 1.33:1 as listed.  2.)  There are five different language subtitles, including English, although Amazon lists only the German.  3.)  Running time is 130-plus minutes as distinguished from the 90 minutes listed.

0517548232|1.0|Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.     In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow.
0345347951|2.0|Clarke has a habit of presenting intriguing problems and then in effect saying \\"Neener, neener, this is beyond human understanding, so I'm not even going to try.\\" Although the narrative is compelling, especially in its gradual revelation of the Overlords, and why they appear in human mythology, it presents more problems than it solves. SPOILER ALERT: What's the point of the Overlords at all, \\"midwifing\\" a doomed race? Why is it necessary to eliminate poverty, war, etc. for the creation of the new species? When the breakthrough actually occurs, what happens inside the kids' minds? Do they realize what's happening? (Clarke makes a point of noting that Jeffrey isn't frightened \\"at first\\" but then seems to happily acquiesce to the breakthrough. Either he's frightened later on or he isn't.) Why don't the surviving adults even attempt to have more kids? (\\"Probably psychological reasons\\" is not an answer.) Why do the Overlords repeatedly \\"envy\\" the doomed humans? In the hands of a narrator like Asimov (sometimes referred to as The Great Explainer), this would have been superb. As it is, it's merely depressing and dissatisfying. Still, I plan to add it to my Postapocalyptic Bookshelf simply because it isn't the kind of book I'll ever forget.
0312335164|4.0|While not Mr. Brown's best work, it's not that far off. I titled my review surprised because I just didn't think it would have as much action as it did.  I mean really, who would have thought computer geeks could be so tough!!  It had me guessing the entire time I was reading it.  So much so that I read the entire book in one day because I just couldn't put it down. It's an easy read that keeps you on the edge of your seat with its fast moving plot and interesting characters that keep you engaged.  It's a must have for Dan Brown fans everywhere!! For those that are unfamiliar with Mr. Brown, I couldn't think of a better place to get started.
0553386794|5.0|For an excellent and well written summary on why, or why not, read this series, please see MISTER SJEM's review.  I can't say enough about this series, and for years I recommended it to friends and family members who read fantasy.  I remember picking up my first fantasy novel \\"The Hobbit\\", and hating it with a passion; such nonsensical drivel with weak characters. I decided right then, if Tolkein was the epitome of fantasy, I hated fantasy, period.  After years of reading tons of mystery's, crime novels, and a vampire series, a friend foisted a copy of \\"Game of Thrones\\" on me, begging me to just give it and the genre a chance.  I can't say I immediately read it, and it certainly gathered a lot of dust sitting on my shelf.  Out of desperation for a book one night I picked it up I was HOOKED after the first 2 chapters.  For the next decade, while waiting on Martin's next installment, I voraciously read all the usual suspects and though I truly love Salvatore, Tolkien (Lord of the Rings,still dislike The Hobbit), Jordan, Goodkind, Hobb, Sullivan, etc., in my humble opinion, none of these can hold a candle to Martin.<br /><br />This is a series that makes you think, feel and examine your ethics, morals, and pre-judgements. Martin never insults your intelligence by pandering to the formula of a square peg will fit in a round whole if you force it.  There is no formula here: You pick up the book, get introduced to the GOOD hero who waxes poetic on how life was so much more simpler before the evil came..if only they defeat it so everyone can just get back to life as normal, blah blah blah. ADD: the Evil antagonist, in whatever form it takes, waxing poetic how life would just be so wonderfully evil if the hero hadn't been born. EQUALS: the reader, who is now on autopilot knowing without any doubt, that it's all going to end with happily ever after! Now it's up to the author to write an interesting plot on how the hero will get to that ending. Some authors do a fantastic job of lulling you into their worlds with their plots and characters, and you enjoy knowing that no matter how harry the circumstances, the hero will prevail.  We all crave happy endings right?<br /><br />Nope, not with Martin.. there is no shiningly reluctant or egotistical hero, no quantifiable evil architype.  As with all beginning chapters, you start forming your opinions of the characters and you get comfortable, cozy even, thinking \\"Okay! We're off and running and I really like this person\\", or \\"I hate that person\\"... then Martin does something brutally refreshing, he smacks you with shocking reality and leaves you breathless as you continue reading in a desparate search through the continuing chapters, thinking, \\"omg, this can't have happened, it can't be true!\\".. But it is, and it changes everything in that instant. Like reality, just when you think you have formed an opinion of a character, as you continue to read, you find yourself understanding that there are always two sides to every story, and your opinion changes and matures. Characters you hated become your focus; you start to identify with them and their plight, etc. Characters you love show their weaknessess and it makes you uncomfortable, so once again, you change your opinion.  You are probably never going to be comfortable reading this series. You are in the moment, in the world with these characters, going through what they do all from first person perspective; something unique that Martin does so brilliantly.  But it's not all darkness, just when everything seems bleak, there comes a superb amount of humor to lighten the mood. The magic of this series came for me when I started becoming fascinated with one particular character I truly found repugnant, terrible and repulsive, only to find him one of the most incredibly interesting and brilliant players in the Game. I would equate it to how I feel watching HBO's \\"Dexter\\"; feeling equally excited and horrified that I'm rooting for a serial killer...<br /><br />I would never dissuade a potential reader by saying \\"if you don't like such and such, then don't bother with this book\\". It's up to you to take the chance that you might love this series, or you might hate it, but one way or the other you will feel something, and Martin will have succeeded.  Just as the saying goes \\"you can't judge a book by it's cover\\", so goes this whole series and all it's characters.<br /><br />That being said, please oh please, let there be more Mr. Martin... I will wait, no pressure! =)ver dissuade a potential reader by saying \\"if you don't like such and such, then don't bother with this book\\".

0307346617|5.0|Just brilliant.  I was put off by 'oral history' in the beginning, but everywhere I looked, this book was given phenomenal reviews.  I'm supremely pleased my curiosity was piqued.  I'd give it a 6 if I could.  It's -that- good.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Impressive game play.  Not too hard,  not to easy.   Great time killer for a bit.   Would love to see other titles as long as they were this good.

B004N66XYE|4.0|This production seemed much more realistic in its plotline than Downton--no devastatingly handsome Turkish ambassador attempting to rape a titled young woman and then kicking the bucket inconveniently in her bed, to start with. It does a good job of showing how the servant situation had changed in 20 years--much more difficult to get domestic assistance as qualified as that before the first war. But Rose does her best with what she has, and the result is a huge help for a struggling young diplomat. (Though the aging sequence is still tricky--when the first series closes in 1930, she should be late 40's or 50, but still looks 30-35; when the new series opens in 1936, she def. looks well over 60; but that problem existed with the Bellamy father and son, too, when they looked more like brothers as the first series neared its close.)    These episodes, however, although beautifully produced, lacked development, which the earlier series of UpDown displayed so beautifully; of course, the notoriously short attention-span of the modern viewer, and the expense of such a production, were probably prohibative, but we really did not have quite enough time to grow attached to the characters--except perhaps for the Jewish lady, a refugee who becomes a maid. Jean Marsh was wonderful, as was Eileen Atkins; and the ambassador's wife did show some character development, I thought, but her sister seemed hopeless, a puzzling lack of compassion in someone so young. I did think her brother-in-law, the diplomat himself, was very well done--it is difficult in this day and age to play a noble character convincingly, and he did; the ship steward/new butler was also a very endearing character, and the young maid, too.    So much preferred it to Downtown--far less soap-opera like, but could have been fleshed out for a superior product; a continuation to see if 165 Eaton Place survives WWII would be very interesting.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|About a week before this became the free app on Amazon, I purchased it on the market. I'm glad I did because the developers deserve the money.  This is so much more than a math problem solver; if you are interested(or required to be) in astronomy, chemistry, or almost anything else, definitely consider purchasing this. There is also a desktop browser version of this application that you can use to determine if it is of any use.
0894803123|5.0|--Excellent recipes but the book was done before we all worried about Salmonella--On the B&J website they addressed buying Pasteurized Eggs. However I found a link on how to Pasteurize Eggs at home.  Simple to do--Heat (140-160 degrees) enough H2O to cover Eggs--Put Eggs in H2O, remove from heat immediately, let sit for 3 minutes. Done--Simple solution, and now the recipes are GTG. I guess what you're doing is making sure the Eggshell is clean. Time for another batch of Butter Pecan.
B000MV90B2|4.0|In my DVD version, producer de Laurentis thanks the Soviet Army (and one British unit), without whom the film would not have been possible.  This means that the film was done in the Soviet Union/Soviet bloc.  As I recall, there was no statement to the effect that no animals were harmed.  With all the horses falling in battle scenes, I'd be surprised if none at all suffered.  If there is a longer version, I'd love to see it.

B004I4H8QS|5.0|It's difficult to improve on a definitive boxed set but Bill Levenson and his crew sure do a good job. In 1990 they did a deluxe version of \\"Layla\\" that included CDs with jams, outtakes, etc. This new 2 disc deluxe edition features both previously released songs, unreleased material as well as a recently overdubbed version of \\"Got To Get Better In A Little While\\" (which had a previous release on the Clapton \\"Crossroads\\" boxed set).<br /><br />The 2 disc set truly is a great way to get this album if only for disc two. As mentioned the first disc (which uses the same mastering as the single disc 2011 reissue edition) sounds decent--it doesn't quite have the dynamic range of an early CD. There's a bit too much compression on it for my taste but for a modern remaster its' not necessarily bad just not the best I've ever heard the album.<br /><br />Disc two was designed according to Executive Producer Bill Levenson to give you a history of the Dominos outside out the main album from beginning to end. Although we don't get any of the \\"In Concert\\" stuff here (you'll have to go for the deluxe edition for that), we do get the original single of \\"Roll It Over\\" and \\"Tell The Truth\\" the former of which includes both Dave Mason and George Harrison on guitar and were produced by Phil Spector during the sessions for \\"All Things Must Pass\\". The second CD opens with an early Dominos recording \\"Mean Old World\\" that was an outtake and was available on the Eric Clapton boxed set (as was the single previously mentioned).<br /><br />New to this set are the performances from \\"The Johnny Cash Show\\" two of which appeared on the DVD for that series released last year. We get both the performances from the show \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Got To Get Better in A Little While\\" as well as two that didn't appear--\\"Matchbox\\" (with Cash and Carl Perkins joining the band) and \\"Blues Power\\". These are sourced from the original videotapes used for the show.<br /><br />\\"Snake Lake Blues\\", \\"Evil\\", \\"Mean Old Frisco\\", \\"One More Chance\\" all appeared on the Eric Clapton boxed set [[ASIN:B000001FOP Crossroads]]  however all of them receive a exceptional remix by original mixing engineer Andy Johns. These are the best these terrific songs have ever sounded on CD and trump the versions released on \\"Crossroads\\" in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Bill Levenson and his crew had included most of the jams that they thought were worthwhile on the 20th Anniversary Boxed set. Here Mr. Levenson decided not to include many of the jams for the untitled follow up album because they really wouldn't have worked--according to his interview they were largely formless and didn't add anything. He did however make an exception with \\"Got To Get Better In A Little While\\" jam which is different enough from the final song and has enough structure to make it a worthwile edition.<br /><br />Closing out the 2 disc set is \\"Got To Get Better In A Little While\\" remixed by Andy Johns with overdubbing done by Bobby Whitlock to finish the song. The original lacked Whitlock's gruff, powerful backing vocals (evident on the live version here and on \\"In Concert\\")and his organ playing. Whitlock added both last year to complete the song and doing so gives this terrific song (one of the best for the unfinished second album)just what it needs. It also provides perfect closure for the second disc of the \\"Layla\\" two CD set.<br /><br />While there aren't any liner notes on the making of the album, the two CD set comes with a booklet with complete credits and recording details for this set. The packaging is a gatefold digipak that folds out. The \\"Deluxe\\" plastic holder that often has held these sets before has been reduced to a sticker for this set much like it was for the recently reissued \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" set.<br /><br />Arguably Clapton's finest moment as a band leader and one of his most powerful albums, the two disc set of \\"Layla\\" will be for fans who want as much of the music as possible without wanting allthe frills.<br /><br />Recommended for the second disc although hardcore fans might want to hold out for the deluxe edition (although it has some packaging issues) since the 5.1 mix is, reportedly, awesome sounding.re fans might want to hold out for the deluxe edition (although it has some packaging issues) since the 5.1 mix is, reportedly, awesome sounding.
0767812387|5.0|I loved this movie. Turned it on late at night after a party; I thought it would put me to sleep. But, instead I was entertained and impressed. The dancing made me dance, clap and smile!! Vanessa Williams is a FORCE to be be reckoned with. Chayanne was wonderful- i love his dnacing style- so natural and homey. This is a movie for my collection.
B004AHNIGM|2.0|I really like some of the songs on this CD. I downloaded one but it rattled my bass so badly I worried about damaging the speakers. It sounds worse in my car. Why in the world with all the advanced technology we have today would someone revert to these horrible production values?? I still remember the awe I felt when I first heard that little cymbal \\"ting\\" in the 1960's version of \\"Stand by me\\". You can barely pick out the instruments in this mess. The late great music engineer Tom Dowd who once worked with the Allmans must be rolling in his grave over this one.  Gregg is not getting any younger either. I pray this is not the last we hear from him.
B00026WU9Q|4.0|My exploration of Bob Dylan continues with this gem from 1965.  I was only 4 years old when this album came out and I assume that listening to this at the time of it's release probably had a significant impact on those at the time. Hearing it for the first time 40 plus years later, I can imagine the impact these songs had on the growing counterculture movement that was happening in the mid-60.  Several huge hits are here that still get airplay today, especially \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", and \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (covered by The Byrds).  I believe this was only Dylan's second \\"electric\\" release and it certainly does rock in places.   Bob's acoustic side is also well represented as well.  The majority of this album is outstanding.  \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Outlaw Blues\\", \\"Gates Of Eden\\", \\"It's Alright Ma\\", and \\"It's All Over Now Baby Blue\\" are certified classics that still hold up well today.  My one criticism comes with some of Dylan's lyrics.  I may be a heretic for suggesting this, but sometimes it just sounds like he is throwing words together because they rhyme and not due to any deep intellectual meaning.  The two examples on this disc are the tracks \\"On The Road Again\\", and \\"Bob Dylan's 115 Dream\\".  To me they just sound like stream of consiousnous rambling with thrown together lines like \\"I ordered some suzette; I said could you please make that crepe\\".  I find it difficult to even listen to these two songs which is why I am only giving this album 4 stars instead of 5.  Overall though, this is another classic Dylan album with only a few minor missteps along the way.
031261246X|5.0|After seeing a notice that it was available, I purchased Zero Day without any expectations but was pleasantly surprised to find a thriller with several unexpected plot twists.

0596804822|2.0|This might be a good book if you're looking to spew out a quick and dirty port of existing code to the iOS. However, if you're trying to learn best practices for iOS development or care about maintainability, use another resource.<br /><br />If you're new to iOS development and use this book, you'll learn how to do everything wrong in terms of Apple's design patterns- not to mention you'll waste a lot of time fixing things that break when Apple modifies their API's. Instead, if you want to learn how to use and implement OpenGL ES applications on the iPhone properly, use Apple's WWDC videos or Jeff LaMarche's excellent series of blog posts on the subject for an introduction and the kronos groups' tutorials when you're ready to learn the OpenGL ES API's in depth.<br /><br />If you already know what you're doing with iOS or OpenGL ES programming, you'll be disappointed to find that the book is almost entirely dependent on a custom cross-platform library, instead of directly addressing the Apple/Khronos Group C API. If you need to use it as a reference, you'll find that the indexing is seriously lacking- at least half the time, you'll find yourself giving up and using an online resource instead.<br /><br />Summary: The quality of the code is more than adequate, with no obvious mistakes such as leaks or unnecessary state changes. My beef with this book  doesn't involve the use of C++, it's with the deceptive title designed to catch the eye of the ignorant, the blatant disregard for battle-proven design patterns, the use of yet another third party dependency that coders will have to worry about maintaining and unlearning when it breaks or otherwise comes up short, and editing so weak that it isn't useful as a reference. There are plenty of better OpenGL ES titles out there for learning or reference, as well as more appropriate free alternatives for learning how to adapt your 3D graphics ideas to the iPhone.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Thank you, Tina Fey! I had gotten away from reading for pleasure for quite some time now, what with the biggest share of my reading time devoted to facebook. I recently purchased an ipad and realized how easy it would be to carry it around and read a book at my leasure.     I have loved Tina Fey in everything she has done so it was with no hesitation that I chose her book for my first purchase from Amazon! WoW, did I make the right decision or what!!! I had to have Kleenex with me every time I sat down to read. I have never laughed so hard at a book in my life. Every page I would have to take my glasses off, wipe the tears away, put them back on and resume reading.     Bless your heart Tina Fey for making me read again and realize I can find humor there too.
B000X107GI|3.0|Got my 5-pack of individually sealed Maxell batteries from the vendor, Best Price Mirror for a reasonable price shipped.  There is NO use by date on the package/packages and they were made in Japan.  See some of my other reviews on batteries if you want to compare.  These batteries are a bit too stale for my interest, but for the price they will give you lukewarm results.  I tested the open voltage on them and they vary but average 3.07 V at 23 C.  That qualifies as a new battery, but it is far from fresh as a new shipment of (Duracell's, Energizer's, etc.) from the local department store.  Great batteries start out with open voltages around 3.35 V.  The significance of the 3.07 V value in this case is that either they are two or three years old, or were stored less time but in a warm place (or they meet a lower spec, or are off spec).<br /><br />Overall, these Maxell CR 2032's don't measure up to the Sony's (5-pack individual perforated blisters, made in Indonesia) which I ordered at the same time on Amazon and arrived the same day and I measured alongside them - the Sony's were purchased from National Brand Dist and had an open voltage of 3.20 V and were all uniform, which is great.  The lower voltage would not indicate to more than 40% loss and still exceeds the manufacturers spec sheet claim (which is purposely a conservative claim).  I also tested these batteries side by side with new Energizers and new Duracell's, which were both over 3.3 V.  The Maxell's were packaged similarly as the Sony's in 5 attached on a perforated card with individual sealed blisters.  However, their open voltage was only 3.07 V on the average.  Unfortunately for the Maxell's, there was variation among the Maxell voltages among those batteries - this is not as good and was not the case with the Sony's.  The Sony's beat them hands down.  My dead batteries all have open voltages between 2.75 V and 2.80 V in my kitchen scale application.  While the discharge is not \\"linear\\" it still gives a good idea of what you are getting and I feel comfortable with my conclusions.<br /><br />I don't recommend these Maxell CR 2032's 5-pack, individually packaged from Best Price Mirror if my shipment was representative of all the sales.  I've reviewed other cheapies and have not recommended any of them ... except the Sony's.  I hope yours works out as well: Good luck!<br /><br />EDIT May 16, 2011: I edited out that the Sony's were cheaper since this is variable.  I would like to add that in my application, which has a pretty uniform use, the kitchen food scale, a pair of 'new' Maxells ordered (of the five-pack) and reviewed here lasted 19 days. This compares to new Duracells from the supermarket (with starting open voltages over 3.35V) which lasted 53 days for the same scale immediately before this purchase.  That is ony 35% of the energy I got from the Duracells.  To allow that they may have been used a bit more, in the best case they had up to 50% the juice of new Duracells for me, probably less in the practical use (vs. my estimate on voltages of 60%).  Anyway it is basically in the same ballpark.  One further comment: If you are going to buy these and your device takes pairs of batteries, buying 5 will leave you with an extra as you burn through them.  So you might have to get 10 (two five packs) in that case.  I would not recommend pairing these Maxell batteries in light of the results, since batteries working together should drain uniformly to get the maximum economy out of your purchase.  Frankly, these are different enough in initial charge as purchased that I'm going to check the remaining three individually and pair the closest two.  That is another reson these batteries were a pain.  Good luck with your set.<br /><br />[second EDIT update June 4, 2011: a second set of Maxell's once again lasted 19 days in the same kitchen scale application].a good idea of what you are getting and I feel comfortable with my conclusions.<br /><br />I don't recommend these Maxell CR 2032's 5-pack, individually packaged from Best Price Mirror if my shipment was representative of all the sales.

030746363X|5.0|I have never written a product review, because nothing has been of such great quality that I felt absolutely compelled to do so. Skip to the end for my PERSONAL TESTIMONY of how this book FIXED MY PERMANENT INJURY!    Tim Ferris provides his readers with superior content. Most other health books on the market are filled with the same filler information- \\"8 sets of 6 reps, a glass of water, and a multivitamin will do the trick! Don't worry if it takes time.\\" Tim Ferris takes that approach and flips it on its head. Rather than sharing that 98% of health information that is obvious and already well understood by the general public, Tim Ferris takes the fringe 2% that provides RADICAL results. What lies within are the hidden secrets to a better life.    Tim Ferris's method is repeatable and life changing. It is much like the saying that goes, \\"Give a man a fish, and he will be fed for a day. But teach a man to fish and he will be full for a lifetime.\\" The 4 hour body (as well as the 4 hour work week!) teach you how to think critically and enjoy life. Open your eyes and buy the book today!      MY PERSONAL TESIMONY    For the past 6 years I have suffered from chronic hip pain. I used to be a track star, and until I bought the 4 Hour Body (4HB), I was miserable. The pain did not allow me to run, walk, bike, swim, rock climb, canoe, or even drive! I just lived with this pain, and until reading this book, I figured that I would simply have to live with it the rest of my life.    Well, I applied a few of the tactics from the book to my life and saw great improvement. But what really fixed my hip was the new way of thinking since reading 4HB. I was given the confidence to take on my fear. I assessed the situation and thought critically. I did the right research. And I did the right things to get healed. Thanks so much for giving me my life back!      PS: I now sleep 4 hours per day and have more energy. All I did was apply an alternative sleeping method found in 4HB!    PSS:With all of the little time savings and increased efficiency learned from this book, I now get about 11,000% more work done in a day AND more satisfying 'mini vacations'. I could rave about this book all day, but I think that I have provided you with the minimum effective dose (med) in order to get across that I LOVE 4HB!      Thanks for the product, Tim! Good business is good for everyone! Keep it up!

B004PGO25O|1.0|This book is dreadful.  It's all sentence fragments and platitudes and puff.  Everything is overstated.      Every page has two and three different font styles.  It's typeset like a ransom note.    Which is a shame, because I liked Pressfield's \\"War of Art\\", and own a couple of his other books too.  But \\"War of Art\\" is a real book, in the English language, with sentences and paragraphs and ideas properly developed.  It actually makes sense.  This \\"Do the Work\\" is none of those things: it's a dog's breakfast; as one other reviewer said, it's like a long (bad) blog post.  Very New Agey, crammed with puffy sentence fragments.      It is incoherent.    In his rush to condemn the inner critic, he does away with any editorial judgment at all, and so we get pure self indulgence.    If this kind of garbage is what Pressfield considers a victory over Resistance, then give me Resistance any day!

I made low-fat vanilla cupcakes yesterday and substituted wheat flour with Spelt (don't try Bob's Red Mill gluten free All Purpose flour; it doesn't work.  I had to throw them away).  I also like the fact that there is a whole section on making various icings and fillings for the cupcakes and also pictures of the finished products.  Glad I bought it.
0525422943|5.0|I read reviews on If I Stay and finally succumbed. I read it. I hated it. I wrote a watered down review because even though I hated it, I know good writing and Gayle Forman understands the craft better than any author I know. Perhaps it felt contrived and maybe vulturistic to write a story based on a tragedy she read in the newspaper. The story was raw and I didn't connect well with the characters.    Let's summarize: Mia gets in the car with her parents and 8 year old brother and drives someplace in Oregon (sorry, I'm not doing this justice because I've forgotten the details). Next thing Mia knows, she is standing by her own broken body, thrown from the car and watching paramedics work on her surviving brother who later dies. Her parents died on impact. Mia has a choice to make. Does she join her family in death or does she make the hard recovery back to life? Boyfriend Adam plays a big part in her choice. The End.    Do I sound callous and unappreciative of a well crafted book? I think I may have to rethink my first opinion, reread the book and rewrite my review after finishing Where She Went. All I wanted to know when I started the book (thank you, Briane!) was whether or not Adam and Mia end up together. No review I read would tell me the answer to that question. The more I read, the more I realized how nice it would be if they did but it was nearly irrelevant (nearly the operative word because I am still the romantic).     Forman does not give the easy answers with pop-psychology phrases. Like a good massage, she works the shallow muscles then goes much deeper until she hits the painful epicenter and the toxins are released. Understanding dawns and a connection occurs.     By this point in time, Adam is a successful rock star. He has the wealth, the gorgeous and intelligent girlfriend, and the talent. Although he withdrew when Mia left, he returned to the stage with raw, painful, and beautiful lyrics and songs. Clearly, their relationship, her accident and subsequent withdrawal from his life offered him muse and he used it as a catharsis. Still, Adam is completely broken. As the story progresses, the reader realizes the reasons for his brokenness is much deeper than Mia dumping him. I really liked that part. The emphasis is not on Mia, necessarily but on how the experience with Mia impacted him.     Adding to the complexity is the organization of the book. Adam toggles from now and the past and Forman paints the full picture with artistic strokes that eventually reveal a much more wholistic picture. While in Adam's head, the reader travels with the couple as they dance around the big issue: Why did Mia withdraw/dump him? Using as many distractions as possible, Mia introduces Adam to her New York until, significantly, the revelations occur on a bridge, a lyrical analogy.     Another aspect I loved about this book is that the reader is taken on the journey of Adam and his metamorphosis which is also interesting when seen in juxtaposition of Mia's quiet admission of her irrational fear of butterflies. There are no aha! moments that shatter the earth or the story. The destination is an objective but, like real life, the process is where growth really occurs.    I really, really loved this book.
030746363X|5.0|I'm using this book primarily for fat loss. And so my review is primarily about that.    I bought this book a few weeks but got around to following his fat loss diet around 2 weeks back. The book gave some good ideas for testing bodyfat. I've used the eyeballing method for determining my fat level. I'm going to try the diet for a whole twelve weeks (you could say that I'm a patient man). Meanwhile, my eating habits and my self-control over food have improved quite a bit. A lot of junk food has reduced as a result of me following this diet.    Also, the exercises for fat loss have had the benefit of eliminating my round back posture.       I'm from India, and much of the diet stuff (including the supplements, food additives, etc) are easy to find here. For instance, the cissus q. is traditionally called hadjora here(the name itself refers to the healing properties of the plant) and is very much in use in India.     BTW, Neither the diet nor the exercises are invented by the author, but the easy-to-read ready reference provided by the book is REALLY helpful. Also the steps suggested by the author quite easy to implement.     Those who have six-pack abs and are implementing similar fat-loss diets or fat loss tricks, using similar exercises or exercise programs, and trying out similar self-experiment are likely to dislike it and criticize it.     Those like me, who have not started any such diet, and are looking to simple steps towards reaching a fat loss goal and a ready reckoner, are sure to like it and rate it higher.    The book is written very interestingly, kinda like a novel so that's an added bonus for me.
B004Q9TK98|5.0|This is one of my favourite Jodi Picoult books. It had me in tears within the first few pages and then also laughing out loud. If you are a Jodi fan you will love this book. I simply could not put it down. I did however feel as if there was something missing to the ending - there were questions I had that were unanswered.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|The Nikon SB-400 was a good purchase for the price and really delivers a great picture using the 60 and 90 degree swivel with no shadow (which is what I was after). The size and case that comes with it is also a plus as it takes up very little space in your bag.  The only negative that I have experienced is that you can not shoot consecutive pictures very fast and it takes at least 3-4 seconds to reset itself even with fully charged batteries.  Other than that it is a great purchase for $119.

B0018LX9T4|5.0|\\"The Secretary\\" is an S&M story-book drama, destined to become a cult classic -  a \\"coming out\\" story of S&M in one's fantasy life, and as acted out in the world. It raises the issues of love, sex and the nature of pleasure, very graphically. The acting by James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal is superb, and the photography as well. The sound track of \\"relevant\\" popular songs accompany the dialogue and is well presented, too. Spader's role  is somewhat overdrawn, and is obviously written into the script, because he is such a fine actor. It contrasts beautifully with Gyllenhaal's \\"understated\\" persona. Seeing the scene played out in a luxurious law office lends the perfect bizarre quality to the theme of what lurks behind the appearance of normalcy, and perfection.<br /><br /> Whether the main characters can keep their activity in bounds is the theme of the movie. A sub-theme is whether this \\"play\\" could be sustained indefinitely. Can the James Spader character keep his law practice intact and thriving, and can both characters achieve a relationship that sustains rather than destroys them? Answering these questions require the viewer to explore their own attitudes toward sex, love and pleasure and pain.<br /><br />  The film also raise the issue of free will vs. compulsion in this very graphical way, and the issue of whether and how people can evolve in \\"healthy\\" ways. What constitutes \\"healthy\\" attitudes toward living and sexuality activity? If we say \\"healthy\\" is life-affirming and \\"unhealthy\\" is what is not, that's just begging the question. Such an answer puts labels on the issues of people's attitudes and behaviors toward themselves and others, given each person's inclinations. There are themes in philosophy and psychology courses here, graphically and beautifully portrayed and filmed. Credit or non-credit courses? you choose.

B000002IR9|5.0|Even though things would change drastically with the upcoming demise of both Otis Redding himself and the original Stax (in the latter case at least temporarily) his career was firing on all cylinders at this point with this album. In keeping with some of the uptown duet albums Marvin Gaye had released with many different female performers during this time Otis and labelmate Carla Thomas did the same thing on this album. The major difference here is approch of course. Whereas the Motorcity duet albums were slick uptown R&B this of course is the same sort of funky southern soul both artists had been doing from the outset.  This approch is most evident in the funkified \\"Tramp\\",wherin Carla lovingly mocks Otis for being \\"country\\" in different ways from his overalls to his cash in hand set to some of Al Jackson's most economically funk rhythms. The two also take on the Marvin Gaye/Kim Weston duet \\"It Takes Two\\",of course this version far heavier on the classic MG's style rocking soul/gospel horns and rhythms.<br /><br />  A good majority of the rest of the cuts aside from the fast paced,high octane rendition of \\"Knock On Wood\\" and the closing \\"Ooh Carla Ooh Otis\\" the rest of the album tends towards slower Memphis soul balladry such as \\"Let Me Be Good To You\\",a version of Sam Cooke's \\"Bring It On Home To Me\\" and the longing \\"New Years Resolution\\",celebrating both the urgent and the pleading side of their nature and,trust me those are two very different things. Even if this is the only proper duet album Otis Redding recorded it showcases how well he works the male/female back and forth while still very much maintaining his own style. Considering the output we now see it seems like Otis Redding spent a good majority of the year 1967 recording in the studio when he wasn't on the road. Perhaps all that performing helped with these inspired sessions but either way this is another one of Otis's great albums and,from what I hear he never was around long enough to make a bad one.never was around long enough to make a bad one.

B0034G4OXQ|3.0|This is a drama on 3 people, a blue collar american, a french journalist and a london school boy,they are all touched by death in different ways.    Matt damon (george) has a special connection to the afterlife, in france (marie) is a french journalist who has had a near death experience and (marcus) the london school boy loses the person closest to him.    Each on a path in search of the truth, their lives will intersect forever changed by what they believe might or must exist in the afterlife.    so did i like it? it was ok really thought there was going to be more about life after death, i got bored half way in the movie and really there wasnt much in the movie to keep me watching it just seem to drag on.
B002FU74Q6|5.0|There is much said (especially negatively) about Milton Friedman that stems from a misunderstanding of what he actually stood for. If you're looking for a good introduction to what Dr. Friedman and advocates of a free market are truly in favor of and why, read the first two chapters of this book. The rest of the book gets more into specifics, but just those two chapters will show the link between economic freedom and political freedom and tell you what capitalism is truly meant to be.    The whole book is great, but I simply cannot recommend the first two chapters highly enough.
0312427999|5.0|The title of my review best sums up Naomi Klein' book The Shock Doctrine - This Rise of Disaster Capitalsim. I have spent two weeks reading up to page 504- mainly becuase I have been highlightingm writing notes and continuosly checking her footnotes-. After reading the story of a poor Shri Lankan woman who survived the epic Tsunami of December 2004, saying \\"if you have somthing for me\\" she said \\"put it in my hand\\"- I was compelled to write an early review before I finished.   One of the most interesting things I found through out the book was the lengthy discription of the C.I.A's MKUltra program and the C.I.A's Kubark torture manual. This discription turned out to be interestingly relevant to the economic policies fronted by the U.S, the IMF and WBO onto countries which were un-coperative with U.S based multi-national corporations. This discription and examination of torture techniques worked as a non-stop metaphor and similie through out the whole book(well atleast where i got up too0 page 504).  I know this review hasn't said much. But truly, it is a must read for anyone intrested in the Globilization debate. I must cut off now as I have work to do and this review is just another way to procrustanate. Thankyou Naomi for the 504 pages of insight you have brought forth. It was worth every penny.
0061148512|5.0|The Bell Jar is not for everyone.  It's one of the most incisive, beautiful, horrifying journeys through mental illness ever printed.  Anyone who has never suffered from depression or any great life-changing event may not get the point.  They cannot fathom the meaning because they have no frame of reference.  This is not a criticism of those who have dismissed the book, but simply my point of reference after bouts of crippling depression and being on the receiving end of well-meaning but ineffectual comments like \\"Distract yourself with some useful task,\\" or \\"Look on the bright side.\\"      The point is that when you're in the throes of depression, no fortune, trip around the world, award, love, gorgeous weather, or satisfying work looks remotely bright.  Some days it's all you can do to take a shower.  Life looks black, hopeless, and utterly without meaning. A person who has never stayed in bed all day and read on a beautiful day because the world outside looked too terrifying may also mistakenly believe that depression is a trendy euphemism for laziness, self-pity, willfulness, and self-obsession.  I assure you, it is not.    To dismiss Sylvia Plath's book as worthless because it doesn't have a plot is really an unfair criticism.  Not everyone wants to look at the darker side of existence, but for those of us who seek meaning from it, this is the perfect book with which to begin.

B002ZG99QS|1.0|No other way to say it one of the worst movies I have ever seen even Fast Forwarding thru the long winded explantions of who,what,when, why it was about an hour too long.  Some and by no means all good sets. Action less then one star rating, visuals like set 3 stars, acting 1 star miserable acting, totally unbelievable plot that should be a negative 10 stars.  I will leave it as one star because it wont allow me rate it lower, and I still have corny memories of loving the orginal and it being one of the elite stand up arcade games of all time.
B00006YXOX|5.0|This album has been reviewed many times and by better critics than I. All I will add is that this is THE Bruckner set to get.  Jochum is unexcelled with Bruckner.  He caused a sensation when he debuted with these symphonies and it was well deserved.  OK, you can get better sound since these are ADD CD's, but the sound is more than satisfactory and what good is great sound when the conductor doesn't understand the music and give it his all.    There's a later set by the same conductor I understand, but the symphonies are clumsily broken up within the set, and Jochum was past his prime when they were recorded.  So stick with this set.
B004PGO25O|5.0|\\"Do the Work\\" does its job.  It's motivational, it goes straight to the point. It's powerful and will talk to anyone who's ever done something meaningful and faced the Beast (which Steve calls Resistance). Good for you if you never have but are you sure you're doing what matters most to you ?  I was surprised to read the negative reviews. Perhaps some readers don't know what a Manifesto is.  The way the book is written and formatted invites to creativity. Concepts jump forward, the rythm of the prose keeps the reader going, wanting to read more, making him feel energized and ready for action, ready to confront Resistance and kick its ass.    For that, Mr. Pressfield, thank you!

1594202842|5.0|If I could I would give it six stars.  I wasn't going to buy this book because I didn't believe in Chinese parenting.  The success of the husband, a product of the opposite of Chinese parenting, proves I'm right.  If the two daughters are to be successful in life, that's not because of the parenting style but could be despite of it.  The two kids are talented musically and academically, just like their parents.    What's amazing about the book is the vivid depiction of the life of a unique family (Chinese and Jewish) and the characters; the natural difference between the two daughters since before birth; the dynamics of the two cultures living together; and the life of a traditional \\"Chinese\\" mother and her children.    I call it a classic because I don't believe \\"Chinese parenting\\" exists in China today, but it may exist outside China.  I won't be surprised that one day this will turn into a movie.    I'm glad I bought this book.  I don't think anyone would dislike reading it even if you find the parenting methods questionable.

B004ISVH6G|5.0|Before this release, \\"Figure In A Landscape\\" was my favorite JW set of music. Rough and Tumble tops it. The band is tight, the songs are well written and John's voice is in top form. Much of the keys are gone in favor of excellent sounding rock guitar by Kyle Cook from Matchbox Twenty. This is basic Adult Album Rock, no teeny-bop-pop BS here. John Waite is the most under-rated singer/songwriter of our time. John's solo music is far better than anything he recorded with The Babys or Bad English. Give this CD a listen, you will not be disappointed.
B00005JMXX|3.0|I went to see this film because I had heard a lot of good thing from my friends. So far the film is great in special effect, however the story was so...o empty. I mean, there were a lot of expression in this film that have intention to warn mankind not to continuing abuse the nature, there will be a greatest debt that we all have to pay in the future then...there a hollywood style, a hero who on his own, drag his friend to NY to save his son and others. That's what I called empty.<br /><br />Anyway, the film did fill me in some thought of the possible future of mankind and make no mistake that it will come sooner than later if we done nothing.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|We have been watching this and the irritating thing to us is you can hear a voice telling you what is happening at times as if the director was cuing. For example, \\"The butler walks into the room and looks perturbed\\" as the butler is doing just that.  Very irritating and totally takes away from the film.  We cannot figure out why this has happened but we did tape it on TIVO which should have nothing to do with this problem.  Hope none of you had the same problem and it appears that you didn't.  We have to give a so so rating due to this.
B004I4H8PO|3.0|I did not purchase this from Amazon, but from a local indie dealer in Pittsburgh. The problems noted in the discussion below are correct. The discs are coated with a thick gummy gooey rubber cement from the slit compartments housing them in the tri-fold sleeve. Luckily, a careful application of Goo Be Gone cleaned it off. Reinserting in the list adds more glue, so they must be stored out of the intended area. More pronounced is the terrible damage to the pop up 3D display of the original album cover. Opening the storage box reveals this display.  However, shifting of the hefty hardbound book in the box while in transit shredded the multi layers of the pop up display. The vinyl discs are in great shape. The souvenirs are a couple of ticket reprints and a badge (which in transit scratched the book binding).  The music, I assume, will be great....a 5.1 surround DVD to be measured against the earlier sacd of a few years ago.  In summary, a package that could have been a great keepsake, but arrived in shambles.  Whoever was in charge of this at Polydor is best suited to future employment at Dairy Queen where errors and incompetence is easily sponged away.

B004I11VZ0|5.0|I have to begin by confessing that I lost interest in martial arts movies some years ago, some time after Bruce Lee's death and the cancellation of the TV series \\"Kung Fu.\\" As our culture dictates, an excess of martial arts films and Bruce Lee copycats followed, saturating the market with mediocrity. However, after watching the exciting and spectacular \\"IP Man 2 - Legend of the Grandmaster,\\" I am kind of attracted to these films again. This is one feel-good, kick-ass movie!<br /><br />\\"IP Man 2\\" apparently takes off where the \\"IP Man\\" - which I haven't watched - ended, and it is also inspired in a true story. In it, IP Man (the wonderful Donnie Yen) returns to British-ruled Hong Kong in 1950. He arrives dirt poor, with a pregnant wife and a young son. With the help of relatives, he opens a martial arts school at the roof of a building, and business slowly begins to pick up. Sadly, just when things are a getting good for him and his family, and when he is becoming famous as a great teacher - he teaches the unique style of Chinese Wing Chun --, he runs out of luck: he meets Master Hung (Sammo Hung), who pretty much owns the city, and is friends with the police. Nobody could open a martial arts school without his approval, which could only be done by following this condition: \\"You are to be open to anyone's challenge. If you aren't beaten when the incense burns out, then you are qualified to teach.\\" In addition, once you earn the right to teach, you have to pay Hung's gang a monthly fee. Even though IP Man unexpectedly wins and earns the right to run a school, he doesn't accept to make the monthly payment, which causes friction between him and Master Hung, making life unbearable for IP Man. Furthermore, an English boxer arrives in town, telling the Chinese Masters that western boxing is superior to Chinese martial arts, generating political and racial tension between the Chinese and the English. As you may expect, the future is in Master Hung's and IP Man's hands.<br /><br />I was just mesmerized by \\"IP Man 2 - Legend of the Grandmaster.\\" The final act of the film reminded me of the Joe Louis and Max Schmeling fights, the Rocky movie series, and other films. The mind-blowing fight scenes, coordinated by veteran Sammo Hung, the fabulous cinematography by Poon Hang-Sang, and the delightful production design by Kenneth Mak, are perfectly glued together by director Yip Wai-Shun. Donnie Yen is a true charismatic actor that you want to see more of, perhaps a true inheritor of Bruce Lee. By the way, the IP Man series is based on Master Yip Man's life. He was credited for creating the Wing Chun School, as well as having a very famous pupil in real life. You will meet him at the end of the film. The fascinating Blu-ray edition of this film includes making of documentaries, deleted scenes, shooting diary, interviews, and more.

But think about it, if it was, everybody would be saying it was just a clone with the guys a decade older. Troy Duffy has given us the greatness that we've been waiting for. We got everybody back and they even let a girl into the boys club. Trust me guys, she earns her stripes. And the ending will have you begging for the last installment.<br />All Saints Day is definitely worth the buy, even if only for the special features. Commentaries with the main actors, a behind the scenes video thats better than any I've seen recently, deleted scenes and oh so much more.<br /><br />I can't wait for third!!! Hopefully it wont take another 10 years for Duffy to hear our prayers. =D

B000PKX2KA|4.0|This USB Gps uses a very powerfull GPS module, and I'm using it for marine navigation through a laptop. Fast, with all the required NMEA sentences to please the navigation software I use. It has WAAS detection so position is very acurate, and power consumption is realy amazingly minimal: Feed through USB port, so no battery to replace, and perfectly waterproof... an small!. Satellites acquisition is realy fast, and it fact it beats in all domains my $300 active GPS module from Raymarine expensive chart plotter!. Since the NMEA protocole requires a serial com port protocole, a simnple driver(USB to serial converter, provided) has to be installed, and that is easily done.   A few drawbacks: 1- Speed is limited to 4800 bps, good enough for NMEA 183, but some navigation softwares may work only with higher speed interface.  2- The NMEA sentences are limited and things like XTE(Cross track error used by autopilots) may not be avalable. In fact the GPS engine (chip)is already capable of everything, but how to access and configure it? . Simply said, the documentation is realy minimalist!. That is the only real drawback. But in conclusion, it does the job, is precise, fast, inexpensive and very reliable...

B004SBQAL0|1.0|Guy comes from outer space with a mission, falls in love with misfit girl, saves the day. This film was summed up with the two minute movie trailer. No need to spend money. Seriously one of the Top Four Worst movies of 2011. 15 minutes into the movie, I kept checking my watch to see how much longer I had to endure and suffer before the movie ended. The script was full of cheesy lines, the special effects looked like the film was made for some cheesy 60's horror movie. It's films like this, that make you wish there were evil space villains out there, just so they could put you out of your misery while you suffer through this film.
0307346609|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic novel.  Written as a series of interviews, you'd expect it to be more of a interesting novelty.  What you don't expect is a compelling, sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes inspiring narrative with charactesr you actually care for.  But that's exactly what you get!  I sure hope that the movie lives up to the promise of the book.
B002WJI66C|5.0|I bought this plush as part as a small Nintendo collection of mine, and I can say this is definitively one of the most well crafted ones in the Mario series. It's not too big but it's not tiny either. It is about 5\\" including the tongue and all the stitching holds it firmly together. It has a small tail in the back unseen in most pictures and it's material is very soft. Inside the lower back part is a beanie bag and the mouth has space inside it, so you can even fold the tongue back in or put other stuff inside it. As for educational value, it's coloring is very bright and well defined, so can be easily used to point out colors. Overall a very good design. If you liked it in the games prepare to feel as if it has popped out the TV to scare you personally :P.

B004IXFGZO|5.0|As a long time Yanni fan, when I first previewed this album, I was reasonably sure that I wasn't going to like it, other than a few songs that sounded good from the get go. Some of his work I have been a huge fan of, and some of it .... not so much. But I decided to pick up this album and give it a try. It really grew on me in a lot of expected ways. I'll break down each song.     1. Truth of Touch - 5/5: This song is much more than what first meets the ear. It has subtle musical nuances here an there that add incredible depth to the overall feel. When I listen to this song, and think about life, this is the analogy that comes to mind: In this world there are people who will tell you you can't. You can't do this or that because you're too poor, too old, too fat, too skinny, etc. But this song says to me, \\"You can.\\" That may not be the message Yanni intends, but it's the inspirational message I get about it. Perhaps the touch of a loved one can encourage you in this way as well. I LOVE this piece.     2. Echo of a Dream - 5/5: This one sounds a little more \\"Yanni-ish\\", but it does so without being old or boring. It's still thoughtful and can sweep you away on a journey. Excellent music to read or think by.     3. Seasons - 5/5: Another thoughtful piece of music with a lot of subtlety going on in the background on top of a solid theme. Very pleasant to listen to.     4. Voyage - 5/5: When I previewed this song before buying, I was like, \\"What the heck is this, Yanni? This is just plain weird...\\" Boy did it grow on me. It builds a sense of mystery, anticipation, and adventure, and is appropriately named, \\"Voyage.\\" It's exciting and unique. I've never heard the likes of it from Yanni. This is something unexpected, but still enjoyable.     5. Flash of Color - 4/5: This one for me falls somewhere between 2 and 4 for me stylistically. It's an enjoyable piece, but not quite as thoughtful as number 2 or powerful as number 4. Still, the violin is strong enough that it's overall a successful piece.     6. Vertigo - 4/5: This sounds like it would make a great song for a video game. I happen to like video games, so this is not an insult, for sure, and 4 out of 5 is still a good, solid song in my book. It's just an exciting, adventurous song, but not a particular standout in any way.     7. Nine - 5/5: This seems like kind of another adventure or journeying song, but it's a stronger and more thoughtful piece than number 5. It works better for me for some reason. Of course this is subjective, as all music review tends to be.     8. Can't Wait - 4/5: A pretty song. Solid vocals, harmony, and premise. Nothing standout, but definitely enjoyable to listen to.    9. Guilty Pleasure - 5/5: This is another piece that has incredible subtleties that add immensely to its passion and emotional message. Whether your guilty pleasure is extra long kisses in the moonlight, indulging your sugary side by eating more chocolate than you should, or catching that extra long soak in the tub, this song is sure to enhance the experience.     10. O Luce Che Brilla Nell' Oscurità - 4.5/5: Another solid vocal piece with successful piano behind it, akin to some of what we got with Voices. It adds some extra strength with a well balanced choir joining in towards the end. Definitely a good song. Almost 5 out of 5 ...     11. I'm So - 2/5: When I previewed this song, I asked myself, \\"What the heck is this???\\" After purchasing the album, I still can't figure it out. I just can't wrap my brain around this piece, or make myself see some special hidden significance to me. It's still just weird. \\"I'm so ... WHAT?\\" Just \\"I'm so\\" you say? Even though I might not magically start liking it, I would still appreciate anyone's explanation about this piece. It's not bad enough that I automatically skip it, but it's certainly not up to par with the rest of the album, and is even slightly more repetitive than most of the other pieces.     12. Long Way Home - 4/5: This definitely showsa lot of style from Yanni's older pieces, and it is another successful piece. Even though it's not a standout, it's very easy to listen to.     13. Yanni & Arturo - 3/5: Although not my thing, this seems to be a decent enough piece. I'm sure fans of Yanni and Jazz will appreciate it more than I do. Not a bad song, by any means. It makes sense and my brain can at least comprehend and appreciate it, unlike #11.    14. Mist Of A Kiss - 5/5: My kids and I all love this piece. It's thoughtful and moving. It draws you in like a good book, captivates you with smooth and effective piano as if it were a story shared by a passionate storyteller. Of course the romantic overtones are included in a song with such a title. This is beautiful, and the subtle flute here and there adds a good bit of atmosphere.     15. Secret - 5/5: BY FAR my favorite vocal piece on this album. It starts out with a standard rhythm and a solid solo voice. Soon, however, there are key changes and other little changes and shifts here and there that convey to you that this song is more than meets the eye. Then, the harmony and background voices come in to add a substantial depth and meaning to this wonderful song. I can easily listen to this song a second time just to take it all in. Wonderful song.     Conclusion: Again, I state that any music review is going to be necessarily subjective. Hopefully this is helpful to some, and you find the magic and emotion in this album that I have. Overall, it's a very successful album, with only a couple of numbers that I didn't like. Most tracks I absolutely love, and I am extremely happy with my purchase.
B003UESJHY|5.0|I saw this in the movie theater and was so impressed I bought the Blu-ray as soon as it was released. Story is more about a dysfunctional family than about fighting. Acting and Directing are superb and the fact that the producers went to such great lengths to make the movie exactly how the true story went down makes it even better.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|How they can feel justified in pricing the Kindle version of this collection at almost double the paperbacks is beyond me...especially when I read reports of poor formatting on the Kindle (which seems to be an epidemic, at least among fantasy books on Kindle). Reduce the price of the Kindle collection by about $20 and I'll be a buyer.
B002ZG9846|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT SURPRISE. I LOVED THIS MOVIE AND THE SEQUEL. Of course the first was the best one
B004I4H8PO|5.0|I'm a Derek and the Dominoes freak, so I'm obviously prejudiced. My package arrived in excellent condition, two of the CD's had moved out of their \\"slots\\", but were easily reseated. The fold out in the cover is fine. I have all of the earlier lp's and CD's, have played them to death, and I plan to play all of these. Worthwhile purchase for an old Layla freak who bought a guitar (a Clapton Strat) and learned how to play at a later age just so I could play Layla. What the hell, life is short, worth the price.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|This book was slow with to many flash backs. I felt like I could not connect with the story. I did read the second book which was much better than the first. I am glad I read this book only because of the second book.
0321525655|5.0|I read Presentation Zen about a year ago and it hit me like a bolt of lightning.  Most books nudge me in one direction or another, but this made me question some of my most fundamental beliefs.     About five months ago, I got a job as the CIO for a nonprofit association that represents over 60,000 Earth and space scientists.  About two months ago, I gave a presentation at an all-staff meeting about where I wanted to take IT.  While people were prepared for a snoozer, they were highly engaged.  I got dozens of compliments spanning over several weeks.  At least once a week I hear people make reference to this presentation.      As we set out to launch a new Association Management System (essentially a CRM for associations), we had our all-staff kick-off meeting recently.  While this sounds deathly boring, some people told me that they were actually looking forward to my presentation.  While I don't know if I could have topped the expectations of the first presentation, it went over very well.   I was stopped over and over by people telling me how much they liked the presentation.      When people ask me what my secret is, I essentially quote this book and say that PowerPoint is an outlining tool - and outlines make boring presentation.  Instead, I put on a Bluetooth headset and walk my dog.  Then I talk to myself (the Bluetooth is to keep my neighbors from thinking I am crazy).  I have learned that it is ALL about narrative and once you have a story down, the slides supplement the story.     When one is new in an organization, it is critical to set the right tone and establish the right image.  This book really liberated me, and showed me how to inject my personality into my presentations.  They are fun, goofy, and sometimes a like risqué.  But they are genuine and I think this speaks to people (how can you be genuine with bullet points?).  So far this job has been going VERY well, and I owe much of it to Garr.  There are a lot of smart people out there who never get noticed.  This book gave me the tools to really put myself on the map.
B004H4XDBI|4.0|I almost didn't read this book. I was not that happy with the first book, this book was much better. Where She Went gave the reader an ending to this very sad story. I thought the final book ended the story well.
B0000246S6|2.0|I definitely have mixed feelings about this release. This is a fine performance of Mozart's Requiem, recorded in Berlin in 1941 -- in the heart of the Nazi regime. It captures an excellent performance and I found it informative to listen to. I am interested in historical performance, and this certainly is one.<br /><br />Bruno Kittel was a respected musician and choir director since the turn of the century in Germany, and by the time the Nazis came to power in 1933 his Bruno Kittel Choir was considered one of the best in Germany. He and the choir continued to fill a prominent place in music under the Third Reich and made many outstanding early recording -- one of the most significant being this, one of the first studio recordings ever of Mozart's Requiem. (Another was a complete recording of Bach's St. Matthew Passion, which is also excerpted on this disc.)<br /><br />The performance itself surely has much to recommend it, for the most part a rich and satisfying rendering of the music. I did find the \\"Confutatis\\" slow, even plodding -- so much so that it caused me to do a double take. A very unusual reading that was extremely effective in the \\"voca me\\" soprano parts underscored by heavenly violins, but with most of the power sucked out of the driving strings and baritones in the main \\"Confutatis, maladictis\\" sections.<br /><br />I was also very surprised by the quality of the recording technology that Deutsche Gramophon was able to bring to bear on such an early recording. The sound quality would be outstanding were it not for record needle noise, which the DG engineers have chosen to leave nearly untouched in all its glory so as not to interfere with the dynamics. Sadly, in parts the needle noise is extreme, although thankfully the worst of it seemed to be concentrated in the first couple of minutes, with a patch of marred record surface distractingly audible at 78 RPM.<br /><br />Even worse is the damage done by Nazi ideology, determined to erase Jewish references from the text of the Requiem mass. As the liner notes point out, lines in the opening \\"Introitus\\" were changed in this performance. The standard section of text \\"Te decet hymnus Deus, in Sion / et tibi reddetur votum in Ierusalem\\" (A hymn becomes you, O God, in Zion / and to you shall a vow be repaid in Jerusalem.) becomes \\"Te decet hymnus Deus, in coelis / et tibi reddetur votum hic in terra\\" (A hymn becomes you, O God, in heaven / and to you shall a vow be repaid here on earth).<br /><br />The Nazi regime justified the changes to the text in the music magazine \\"Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Musik\\" at the time, saying Mozart's Requiem \\"should not be allowed to languish in obscurity simply because of a handful of passages in the text that are unsuited to our age.\\"<br /><br />I am one of those people who even has a problem with Leonard Bernstein's \\"Ode to Freedom\\" revision of Beethoven's 9th when the Berlin Wall fell, where he changed \\"joy\\" (Freude) to \\"freedom\\" (Freiheit) in the final movement. But because that was an attempt to express a noble sentiment, I can overlook it with minimal grumbling. However, the changes to the Requiem on this recording made in the name of a hideous ideology rub me very much the wrong way. It does seem that they left in the reference to the prophet King David in the \\"Dies irae\\", but this is small consolation.<br /><br />Overall this is a very good performance and recording that is of historical significance in many ways. On the positive side, it is an example of fine wartime musical performance in Germany and of surprisingly good early sound engineering. Unfortunately, it is also a testament to the impact of an ugly dicatorial regime on artistic life.<br /><br />A five-star work and performance that loses serious points for the sometimes very bad record needle noise and the Nazi edits. Really only can be recommended for people with a strong interest in historical performance. Get a good modern recording to really sit back and enjoy this work.mass.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Hands down the best calendar I have found and used in android! Widget options are awesome for any screen size!
B003XU02QG|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I am really big on the ancient Picts. and I do like the way they were portrayed in this movie. The only thing I found was wrong was that Agrolica was not around during the time of Hadrian. He was around during the time of Dominantion and had died in 96AD. this story took place during 117AD. I liked the fight scenes and the mind set of how the Picts thought. I know the Romans are supposed to be the good guys, but I understand why the Picts were the way they were. They didn't want to be told how to live their lifes and the Romans couldn't see that.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I was very pleased with my recent purchase. The Matrix Collection arrived ahead of schedule and in the condition as promised. No problems whatsoever.
B004ODLUF8|4.0|I'll let you know how well I like this when it comes out on blu ray.  If you have a good surroud system the lift off scene at high volume is the bomb!
B00005N6KG|5.0|These headphones are perfect for listening to podcasts and audio books - very light weight with decent sound quality (considering how light they are).  They fit inside the ear but do not totally block out outside noises so you can still hear other people or traffic when walking (especially when listening to spoken word).  Unlike ear buds, they stay around your neck when not needed instead of flopping around.  Sound quality is just ok for music but plenty good enough for audio books and podcasts.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Widgets stopped working. They were working just fine and then they randomly just stopped. Very annoying! this is something that should be fixed as soon as possible!

B000FBJF6Y|4.0|I found my copy at Goodwill and it seems like books you get for practically nothing sit around for awhile.  But I began reading it when I couldn't find anything else in the house and it was simply delightful!  I agree with some of the other reviews about the blatant view on males but Mma R. has experiences to back this up so I can accept it as part of the novel.  I hope the remaining books in the series are as well written and charming.
0937381888|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been printed?  This book is more than what I thought it would be.  Very good info for the beginner and even more for those who are trying to expand their capabilities.
0670022411|1.0|It started out okay, then turned out to be very boring and very high schoolish. It was a waste of time as far as I'm concerned unless you're 13 years old.  I did finish it but was in pain the entire way.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Wow, this one loads fast! I have it loading 5 different calendars and it is fast! I also really like the display options. Very useful.
B000O59AFW|5.0|Good action flick if you suspend belief on a few things - and who wouldn't for a nice time at the movies ?!
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Im pretty happy with this app. So far, no force closing, Im getting all the info I need. The app is very user-friendly and works with your existing Google Calendar.<br /><br />The widget is customizable and works very well.  The only thing is it doesn't scroll like the stock HTC Widget.  And in all, I like it and would recommend it even when it's not free.  at least for now...<br /><br />HTC Thunderbolt
B0026OE2O8|5.0|This is an excellent show about our home planet - well done. One slight glitch I've noticed is that everywhere this film is listed, Actor Glen Close is listed as the narrator. In reality, his voice is never heard anywhere in this production. The narration is beautifully done by a female voice with a slight British accent, by the name of Isabelle DeLannoy. She is listed in the closing credits under \\"cometary\\".
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is full of insight and artistry.  I sat down and listened to it again for the first time in years and it still sounds refreshing.   Ms. Lauryn has a lot to say and this album says it beautifully.  My favorites \\"Ex-Factor\\" (..no matter how I think we grow you always seem to let me know it ain't workin) and \\"Nothin Even Matters\\" (a sweet and mellow duet with D'Angelo). My suggestion is give it as a gift to any young woman who wants a dose of reality with their music.  Every young woman in my family has found it to be \\"educational\\". Thank you Lauryn for this masterpiece.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I thought app was great,very challenging- made u think! completed game ,wish it was longer. want more games like this!!
B004SBULWE|4.0|Though not an absolute requirement as it used to be,  this is still one of the most  efficient ways to not only kill (multiple) Apps,  but it's also a good way to switch between running apps.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very small, I was surprised it worked so well.    Well worth the price.  Now I have to be careful  not to loose it because of its size.  They should make it a color so you  can spot it easier.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Great music player AND it can stream from the cloud.   Works well and easy to use.   Nice interface.  What more can you possibly ask for?
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Good calendar application. much better than the default Android calendar but that's a small task to accomplish.  Would be better if the widgets were more customizable and it actually hid the accounts you unchecked sync with.  Going back to Jorte for my calendar.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Looked around for HP laser printer memory.  Most of it was very expensive.  This was the correct memory at a great price.

Has anyone had a similar problem? Is there a fix for this issue?  >
B0032JTV6U|5.0|Forget about the storyline, writing, or actors for a second - what makes Glee absolutely amazing is the fact that it's boldly (and successfully) gone where no other show has gone before: the musical. How COOL is that? And yes, the writing is great, the cast is phenomenal, and the story-lines are current and relatable :)    Even if you're a huge Gleek, you might not know exactly how much goes into making a show like this. You've got the choreography, the melody, the camera set ups...but what about stuff like getting the rights to the music? Not an easy task to accomplish.     [[ASIN:B004VSZCZK Glee: Cast & Creators Live at the Paley Center]] is a must have for any fan.  There is a ton of great behind-the-scenes information about the music, the characters, creating the show, etc. The cast members and producers also share great stories from on-set. After watching the panel discussion I feel like I have more inside knowledge about the show, which makes it even better to watch on TV or DVD. On more than one occasion I've been able to answer a friend's question about Glee because I have the Paley Center DVD - makes me feel super smart!
0763644765|5.0|I never leave a feedback, but after buying this book I have to.  With only 1 hair, I easily persuaded my son that the book is about him.  He is only allowed to read it on the potty.  The pages background are in solid colors, so you can practice colors.  There is a dog and cat in the book, so you can talk about them.  There is easy text on each page, so my son is recognizing words now.  I'm impressed.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Best calendar app out there for sure.  Used it in beta and bought afterwards.  Buy it for sure especially when it's free.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|The crappy Jabba scene, the cartoonish looking Mos Eisley, the butchering of Jabba's palace and the Ewok celebration song, the placement of Hayden.... I could go on and on.  All of this means NO purchase from me.    George, the fans have spoken.  We are the reason you are filthy rich.  Please do us a favor and give us what we want.  I would pay sick amounts of money for original cut in HD.  But will NOT be buying these POS cartoons.
0142501123|5.0|A gem.  Clearly a LOT of effort went into this book.  Either that or the author is incredibly skilled.  I am THRILLED to see she has other books and will purchase them all today.  This story is simply delightful.  It's impossible to not read it joyfully and engagingly, using different voices for the characters.  The language is lilting and rhythmic, and the words used to rhyme are creative, visceral, and imaginative.  \\"Over the reeds and the rivers they flew.  The bird shrieked with glee as the stormy wind blew.  They shot through the sky to the back of beyond.  The witch clutched her bow but let go of her wand....\\"  And it's not just the nice language - it's a full, complex tale with beginning, middle (e.g. climax), and end (e.g. resolution).  Delightful.  To boot, the art is beautiful.  Excellent pair, Donaldson and Scheffler.  A must have.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I connected this device to a 32 bit Windows 7 machine. Windows tried unsuccessfully to install it but the device popped up a window and asked if I wanted to download the drivers. Now the device comes with a CD but I figured I would get the drivers off of the net and thereby get the latest ones. They downloaded and installed inside of a couple on minuets. I just had to unplug the adapter and plug it back in and bingo. It is now connected to my Uniden 780XLT scanner and it works perfectly.   And by the way I love Amazon Prime...
B001FB4W0C|4.0|For a series that generally expands on ideas that have already been laid out by classic and modern movies, 4 is surprisingly original. Instead of delving out 17 episodes that are more or less self contained, and 5 or so that concentrate on the overall story arc, most of the episodes here concern the story that has been evolving since the start. It moves slower, and gets a bit too melodramatic at points, but the writing on the series as reached a peak with this season. There is an abundance of fresh ideas and many clever spins on the shows own mythology. Great series, best season.
0307477479|5.0|I will not restate the info in the more detailed reviews. Just will add my own 5 star review and observe that this is one of the best and most creative books I have read in a very long time.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|can't beat free. downloaded app it's good. better interface and easier to use than stock calendar on droid droid. me likes!
B004XWLN20|5.0|The series is great!  But just releasing it on DVD?!?  They aired the pilot on HD, and it looked great.  They're saying that the special effects for seasons 1-4 aren't Blu Ray quality.  ALL LIES!!!  They will release the series on Blu Ray down the road to double dip us.  Give us the complete series is Blu Ray NOW, not later!!!
B0017KIBAI|5.0|I play a number of Gamecube games on my Wii.  The Gamecube controller I was using is pretty worn out so I was looking for a replacement.  This controller is perfect because 1) it is a genuine Nintendo product and 2) its cord is almost twice as long as the original Gamecube controller.  I considered buying a used Wavebird since they can often be found for a similar price, but I decided against it because I don't want another device to feed batteries and the Wavebird doesn't have rumble functionality.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|by far the most fundamentally sound, and functional app.  this is the type of calender app I have been wanting for quite some time now. very versatile and customized for the android user. great job! the 6th app I've ever rated 5 stars.
B0038BBA4I|1.0|This is simply one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It is lyrically immature and musically repetitive. Here's a game: count the number of times in a song that you hear the theme played. Repellent.
0765348276|5.0|Scalzi's book was like a breath of fresh air to me. I was sucked in from page one - something that is rare these days. I highly recommend the book to anyone interested in science fiction and action fiction.
B000GGSMB2|5.0|I purchased this movie and it came in the condition I ordered it(new).It is a great movie.It came quickly and the ordering process was quick and simple.I would recommend this movie to anyone who is an Al Pacino fan.I would definately order from this seller again.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Much better than stock calendar, great options. Would be nice if Month view was optimized for tablets and showed description of events.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|As always Mr. Connolly kept me enthralled to the very end with an unexpected plot twist, and a wonderful set up for the next Lincoln Lawyer installment.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It has my local stations, but it is CONSTANTLY buffering and pausing.  Fix that and you get more starry goodness.  Nice other features such as listing talk stations lineups.  HTC EVO 4G.
B000AQBAUI|5.0|I had never heard of the band until I found this album on Amazon off a link from something else.  Holy jeez!  This is great music.  I get the Led Zeppelin references, but they sound far more like Free than Led Zep.  Most of the people commenting probably don't even know who Free is, so I will forgive them.    I have played this album for probably 20 different people and all of them are shocked that this album wasn't a huge hit.    The album was rated \\"the most collectible rock album\\" a few years ago because it is so good and hard to find.  Get this now... every song is REALLY good and you can impress your friends by finding a GREAT album that they have never heard of.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Get this app! I actually paid for it on Android Market and use it everyday now in place of the HTC calendar app. Syncs great with Google Calendar and actually lets you edit, after-the-fact, the Calendar that you set your appointment to. Good stuff
B004TTMYQG|3.0|This calendar has a few nice features to it but by &amp; large, nothing worth switching from Jorte for.&nbsp; All the main features I look for in a calendar app are already taken care of in Jorte &amp; it has more customization, not to mention a more pleasant interface than Business Calendar.&nbsp; Definitely not worth the asking price since Jorte is free.
B004TTMYQG|2.0|The functionality is OK but this is one of the  ugliest calendars. The month view is almost impossible to see anything on. It would be a pretty good app if they would polish it up.
0374158460|1.0|As with Ed B in the 1* reviews, I often read reviews before the book.<br />In this case, I read the Paris Review interview with Franzen, issue #195,and then some of the reviews here.<br />Pardon if I am out of turn, having not read the book.<br />Franzen's physics/science  background seems to be the problem which he hasn't addressed.  In science it is necessary to know as much as possible about the universe to make any new theories or to even intelligently comment on the current quantum state.<br />This can only take you so far.  Then talent and genius are necessary.<br />In fact, take baseball as a simple analogy.  Most major-leaguers are well versed in the nuances of the game, but some rely strictly on talent without being intellectual about it.<br />Pardon again if this seems simplistic, but Sam Goldwyn's quotes resonate with me:<br />\\"If you want to send a message, use Western Union.\\"<br />and<br />\\"Anyone who wants to learn about psychiatry from the movies should have their head examined.\\"<br /><br />Franzen refers to Kafka as a major influence, especially The Trial.  He seems to evaluate it as an example of the post modern dilemma of dysfunction and distraction.  I read the Trial as a case of arrested development being confronted (Eric Fromm: Escape From Freedom).  Is this old school on my part?<br />Secondly, he admires novels which move right along, but also admires Proust's lengthy development.  Probably either can work, but this is where genius and talent are required.<br /><br />Am I going to read the book?  I find I can pretty much tell if I'm going to like a book by reading a randomly selected paragraph or page or two at the library.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This has been my go-to app for keeping times straight since it was in early beta. The graphic representation of time slots has helped me to keep appointments I might have otherwise overlooked.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|My whole family enjoys this game. We have a lot of fun playing. Get this app. You'll have fun too!
B004G6009U|4.0|Very cute movie - looks great in blu-ray.  Not a lot for adults in the extras, but still well worth the money.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My son loves this game. He no longer minds waiting with me at appointments. He plays this game while we wait.
B002ZG976U|4.0|The movie itself came in great shape. Cover still on. Only negative bit was that there was a small scratch on the holder. Other than that, good buy!
030726999X|5.0|I think this is the best of the three books in the series.  It is complex and intriguing, and I liked the ending.  In my opinion, Stieg Larsson's death was a tremendous loss to the literary world.  HIs character, Lisbeth Salander, will live on in my mind for a long, long time.
B004G600A4|4.0|This is another Disney animated classic in the making...nearly as compelling and as visually stunning as SNOW WHITE, SLEEPING BEAUTY, CINDERELLA and other timeless Disney classics. This is primarily because the production team, while using CGI, made a concerted effort to create the fluidity of movement of the hand-drawn art found in older Disney animated features. They succeeded so well that, aesthetically, the visuals in TANGLED are even better than the old classics. And the adaptation of the Grimms fairy tale story of Rapunzel had been waiting in the wings for Disney Studios all these years...cant believe they never produced a Rapunzel feature-length film before now. A loose adaptation, since the rescuer of Princess Rapunzel is a lovable thief instead of a prince, it is still an exceptionally well written screenplay and the music and song just enhance the mood and the overall quality of the film. The casting of voice actors is also top drawer, with Mandy Moore as Princess Rapunzel and Zachary Levi as the thief, Flynn Rider. Also listen for Donna Murphy as Mother Gothel and Brad Garrett, Ron Perlman and Jeffrey Tambor as the voices of the hilarious pub thugs. While not voiced, the animated horse, Maximus, is also a highlight, mostly from a humorous perspective. As with other Disney animated features, this one is family friendly...kids and adults alike should love it equally. And as with all Disney animated features that are based on fairy tales, we are comforted in knowing that everyone lives happily ever after...:-)
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This cal. is the best out there for androind. its so easy to use and it makea your schedule easy to follow. eveyone should downlod this right away
0307577589|5.0|I love having a story for the ride to and from work, so I bought the book on CD.  This is a gripping compelling story from the first moment the narrator spoke.  IT held my interest and while it is a tragic story it speaks to the strength character possesed by the young woman in the book.  I couldn't wait to get in the car to hear the next installment.
B004I4H8PO|5.0|My box arrived from Amazon today in perfect condition - with none of the problems some folks have complained about in their reviews (notably the ones who didn't even buy from Amazon!) - my sister also received hers today in perfect shape so I think the odds are leaning towards buying from Amazon without fearing too much of receiving damaged goods!  It's a great boxed set with some of the greatest music ever recorded - I have absolutely no complaints!
B001GCUO5W|5.0|Awesome movie.  Looks great in Blu Ray.  Ive seen this movie three times before i bought it, and two more times since i received it three days ago.  Highly recommended for fans/anyone.  Great price too.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Very nice, thanks Amazon! This app gives you a lot of great features I haven't seen anywhere else, like a quick way to select multiple days to view. It is super quick and smooth, and gives you a pretty good widget to use on the homescreen. It's not quite a good as Pure Grid Calendar in that regard though, since you can have a scrollable widget in PGC.   This is probably one of the best apps Amazon has offered so far, make sure to grab it!
B004WMKXWM|4.0|I enjoyed the movie and the only thing I noticed was it seemed washed out in the dark scenes in the beginning of the move. Other then that issue I liked the fact the Amazon streams the movies in its entirety to my TiVo box. I noticed no pixilation or any other visual anomalies that I have experienced using Verizon on demand movie service and it was a dollar cheaper at Amazon for the HD version.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great app!  But, am I correct that, if you add a new Exchange event, it doesn't automatically push the event to the Exchange server?  You have to force a sync or wait for your scheduled sync?
0767817710|5.0|If you like westerns, this is a great one to watch. A kind of a new day twist to the spagatti westerns that stared Clint Eastwood..now Sharon Stone.  Stellar performaces by Gene Hackman, Russell Crowe and a minor cast that will memorize you, So grab the popcorn, sit back, relax and enjoy a good movie!

B00164GDA0|5.0|In my very large collection of blu rays (possibly too large, given that the format will be gone in another 4 or 5 years), this stands out as one of half dozen titles that defined my childhood. I often wonder, had I never seen them as a youngster, how I would feel about certain films. I can say without question that this film would be as impactful now as it was when I viewed it through the eyes of innocence. The encapsulated childhood that Rob Reiner and Stephen King rendered in Stand By Me is almost unparalleled. Nearly every adult can view this film and completely relate to the content, the emotion, and the characters.    Unlike The Goonies, Monster Squad, or any of the other great 80s kid adventures, this is a much more realistic, very adult story. Although it was an extremely popular theme throughout the 80s, this is not the 'lets get a group of kids together and let them have the ultimate kid adventure.' (again, ala goonies, space camp, the wizard, explorers, etc...) This film deals with the torments of youth; torn families, coming to terms with death, and, obviously, standing up for your fundamental beliefs even if you are clearly outmatched.    The BD itself is quite wonderful. It has a marvelous picture-in-picture commentary with Rob, Wheaton, and Feldman. This isn't quite as spectacular as the Goonies picture-in-picture as the entire cast (obviously) could not be present. They share many, many memories from the set, their performances, some very poignant moments regarding River (you can see that his passing still affects them all very strongly), and even point out some very entertaining easter eggs and mistakes in the film.    I couldn't recommend this film more for kids who are coming-of-age, or for adults who wish to shortly relive that time of misunderstood semi-adulthood.
B004EPYZQC|4.0|The last three sequels hardly offered anything new, you just had more fast cars and more races. So I didn't expect much from Fast Five at all. However the movie is surprisingly fun and exciting, due to better writing and direction.<br />  The fast cars and races are still in the movie of course, but here you have the addition of a Ocean 11 like heist plot and the Rock as a relentless special agent named Hobbs that will do anything to get Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel) and his team.<br />  I just don't understand why Han (Sung Kang) from Tokyo Drift is back with no explanation to how he's still alive, since didn't he die in that movie ? But that's easy to ignore since Fast Five is fun either way and the best action film of the year so far.
B002RL7VKC|5.0|love this set as dones my son. He received this from his grandparents for his 2nd birthday. Very high quality like most lego products. Would definitely recommend it.
B002T921DE|5.0|AWESOME CONCERT  i dont  see how people have said the sound is not good on this bluray. i have a bose 7.1 sound system and it sounds like im right there. unless youre using a really cheap system it will sound amazing. i loaned it to a friend and they enjoyed it as well  even without a sound system like mine
B0028RFBSE|1.0|This is the worst Manowar album ever.  If you grew up on them in the early days and liked that sound, this is nothing like it.  Check out \\"Fighting the World through \\"Louder then Hell\\" era.  That is What Manowar should sound like.  I bought it for $1 at a pawn shop and feel like I was ripped off.
6300216365|4.0|I loved this movie.  Woody Allen is at his self-depreciating best in this early (1972) film. I loved the whole premise of the neurotic Allen Felix (Woody Allen), when suddenly dumped by his wife, tries to adopt the tactics of his Casablanca film hero, Humphrey Bogart, using Bogie's \\"tough\\" no-nonsense approach, to date new women.  He enlists the help of his married friends (Tony Roberts and Diane Keaton), to set him up with eligible women, and in the process finds himself falling for his best friend's married wife.  Woody Allen expresses many of the insecurities that many men have in the dating scene.  Woody Allen's character is the exact polar opposite of Bogie, and this makes it all the more fun to watch him take \\"Bogart's\\" advice and try to implement it. I was laughing out loud many times throughout the film.  Very enjoyable. The actor who imitates Bogart is superb in his role.  His impression of Bogie is astounding.<br /><br />I have watched this movie with people who are much younger than me, and they do not have as favorable a response to it as I do.  Perhaps Woody Allen's humor is generational to the Baby Boomers, of which I am a member.  I'd also recommend watching \\"Casablanca\\" before watching this movie, so one understands Allen's obsession with Bogart.<br /><br />kone
B001PPLIEG|5.0|I liked this movie almost as much as Casino Royale. Olga was very beautiful and I hope she appears in another Bond film. It's hard for any film to stand up to one as great as Casino Royale though. I think Daniel Craig is the perfect contemporary James Bond. As good as the young Sean Connery- I thought Connery grew too old for the part in the last few he did. I like how Bond is now able to use modern technology to track villains etc.      Look foward to the next episode.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Awesome app! This is what the native calendar should be like. I would recommend this to all my friends. Well worth the money.

0743297334|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Deceptively, Hemingway's \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" (hereafter TSAR) seems like an \\"easy\\", \\"accessible\\" introduction for a literature novice. Of course, the language and dialogue are seemingly direct, plain, and unpretentious. The plot seems simple and even unsophisticated - at least five expatriates \\"live it up\\" on a languid road trip from Paris, France to Pamplona, Spain. You get a fine European country travelogue and intimate descriptions of bullfighting. You get fishing, casual love affairs, and even a clumsy fistfight. Sounds like a novel a college student could swallow in a day or two - even during Spring Break. Well, yes and no.<br /><br />If you are not acquainted at all with Hemingway's spare, naked prose, quite naturally TSAR seems like a pulp fiction novel about nothing. But if you are even superficially aware of the novel's milieu -post World War I Europe- you know enough to penetrate the surface of this simple story to see the sad, existential despair underneath. Each of the main characters, the first-person narrator and \\"emasculated\\" newspaperman Jake Barnes, the earnest Jewish pariah Robert Cohn, the insolvent, crude Mike Campbell, the fun lover Bill (forgot his last name), and especially the pathetic maneater \\"Lady\\" Brett Ashley ultimately lead empty, unfocused lives of both quiet and not-so-quiet desperation, and futilely try to fill that emptiness with food, sex, machismo, and especially drink (lots of drink). I think thats the predominant theme of TSAR - WWI shattered our past lofty illusions and placed us in terror of our mortality and there's nothing we can do to ensure a bright, safe future. We are doomed to oblivion, so in the meantime all we can do is \\"enjoy\\" this fleeting present as much as we can. This nihilist philosophy is strikingly similar to that of Norse mythology, except it does not spur TSAR's characters to perform heroic acts.<br /><br />Although of course the writing is not ornate in TSAR, it seems obsessed in describing so many things in closely-observed detail. We get specific descriptions of Parisian streets, Spanish countrysides, European cafes, the Pamplona corrals and bullfighting arenas. I think it is a deliberate distraction to underscore the inconsequentiality of Jake's and his friends' lives - just something to kill the time. Hemingway lavishes particular attention on the Pamplona fiesta, which lasts several days and is filled with noise, parades, fireworks, and of course the running of the bulls. Again, sound and fury signifying nothing.  Sometimes the characters can't even enjoy the surroundings; on several occasions, for example, Jake is so hung over or tired or both, he misses some of the bull fights and has to get secondhand information from his companions (I hesitate to call them friends). The information is usually unvarying; either Mike can't pay his creditors, Robert Cohn is an unwanted pest, or Brett jilted yet another suitor. Too much information about nothing.<br /><br />TSAR will either inspire thoughts of empathy or schadenfreude within you. You may sympathize or even empathize with this frantically hedonistic crew, or (as I must confess I did) wax superior and relieved that my life, full of woes and cares as it is, is not that sad. Most of us may relate best with Jake, who is as dissolute as the rest but at least is aware of it. For example, he is in love with Brett but cannot consummate it because of his WWI wound. Toward the end of the novel, when Brett wires him for assistance and exclaims that they would have a grand life together if not for the wound, Jake replies \\"Isn't it pretty to think so.\\" Jake has no delusions.<br /><br />TSAR's overall tone is pessimistic and even bleak, but it has its sharp observations of humor, as when Mike states he has two types of bankruptcy - gradual and sudden. The characters' put downs of each other are amusing. Jake learns you have to buy friends and decides not to tip the train conductor more generously because he'll never see him again. The European descriptions are charming and may give you the urge to travel. But yet again, the point is it is all a superficial veneer. In conclusion, TSAR will be a fast but baffling read for unworldly people who will wonder what the fuss is all about, but for more mature, world-weary people, it will reveal the empty, present void beneath the busy surface.r see him again. The European descriptions are charming and may give you the urge to travel. But yet again, the point is it is all a superficial veneer.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying that i've used calendargoo and touch calendar extensively. I thought calengoo's drag & drop style abilities were awesome, this is just in a whole new league.<br /><br />Business calendar is still being very actively developed, which is always a great thing. If you're going to pay for this, it's nice to know things will be fixed as well as added. 12 widgets, covering every size, and type. Easy to add event's, even straight from the widget. Can drag & drop, schedule reoccurring events, and it does a fantastic job syncing all my calendars with zero work from me. Widgets and app look good. This just plain works well, i'd urge everyone to DL this today. If you miss out on it for free, and need a solid calendar app. This is hands-down the android calendar app i'd recommend.<br /><br />Phone: Droid X(Android 2.2.1, Liberty 2.0.1)
0811879542|5.0|Some of the simplest of ideas can be the most engaging. I had initially thought this book would be best for younger children - maybe three or four year olds. Wrong. My six year old is absolutely taken with this book. I think it must be the interactive quality that has him hooked, or the fact that he thinks he's controlling the dots' outcome. It's probably a combination of the two that makes this book irresistible.    The first page has the single yellow smudgey dot from the cover with the directions \\"Press here and turn the page.\\" Similarly, each page has a number of dots with a single direction. As you follow the directions, your actions will make more dots appear, change colors and fly about the pages. Soon you will be clapping your hands, rubbing the dots, standing the book up straight and shaking it around - whatever you need to do to make those dots move. I love that you need to rely on your imagination to really be taken in by the book. Just let go and do what the book tells you to do and it feels like magic!     I think this is one of those books that is so simple, it make you think \\"Why didn't I come up with this?\\" and really marvel at the person who thought to put it together. So let's all take a moment a marvel at the ingeniousness that is Herve Tullet. He has been creating children's books for 15 years and has come up with some amazing things. It makes me a feel a bit better to find he's no one-hit wonder.
B004TTMYQG|3.0|Great calendar with good customization options, much better than the stock, however, it needs to have an option for Tasks and a sync with Google Tasks.  Tasks functionality is basic on Microsoft Office and even on Lotus Notes.
B004I4H8PO|1.0|NOTE: This review replaces one filed on 4/27 that apparently slipped through the cracks.    This is one of the most frustrating box sets I've ever bought -- Universal has done a fantastic job with the sound, including the live performances on IN CONCERT, and with the book. And there are no complaints about that part of this package. But oh, the packaging . . . when I opened this set, it seemed as though three of the five CDs (actually, one DVD) were missing; it turned out they slipped beneath the pockets holding them, and getting them out meant tearing part of the cardboard panel; and they were marked up, dinged up, and one platter had glue on it. Now, if this were a used set, I might accept some of that (though not the glue); and if it were less expensive, I might let it go -- but not for $100. Why can Bear Family Records do box sets with a lot more discs (though also usually at around $20 a disc) and get it right, with far fewer copies to sell to a smaller audience, while Universal can't? I like the people at Bear Family personally and wouldn't accept a product like this from them, and I surely won't accept it from Universal, which has a lot more resources at its disposal (and, 24+ years into the CD era, ought to know how to do things like this right on so basic a level).     So I brought it back to my retailer, who agreed with me that a $100 set should not have these problems right out of the box. And we opened a second one -- in that one, TWO of the five discs were \\"missing\\" and had to be retrieved, and one of those had spot of glue on the playing surface. And the internal 3-D artwork was crushed and torn, probably by the hardcover book. So he gave me a full refund and said he was going to let his back-office people know, as well as his Universal rep. Good luck, anyone ordering this -- I especially feel for anyone getting it through the mail.
1416596585|4.0|In a very detailed, well-sourced account of Google, one of the best known tech writers- Levy, provides a fascinating, unique look at one of the most written-about companies.  No other book on Google has been able to articulate the evolution of Google's business model - the growth of AdSense and AdWords, in a crisp manner. Moreover, the initial chapters on the evolution of search at Google is one of the succinct yet complete exposition on the topic. Interspersed with all these discussions, are character peeks into the key personalities that drove these initiatives - and it is surprising how much more details on the founders and the key players continue to emerge...after all these books.      Levy is also artfully tap into more recent trends - the push towards cloud computing, the issues facing data centers, Google's foray into phones and when it almost became another telecom company.  In each of these topics, Levy's narrative style will enable even a reader with no tech background appreciate the technology challenges.  Levy is also able to portray Google China's challenges and its standing up to censorship in a way no other author has.  The narration of the \\"fall-out\\" between Apple and Google is also a very interesting read and provides a unique glimpse into Steve Jobs.     It is perhaps in the last few chapters, Levy seems to have run out of patience and focus. The chapter on anti-trust issues and another on \\"google.gov\\" seem very hastily written and do not provide a suitable end point for this painstakingly researched tome.  The conclusion of the book seems a little forced and perhaps it is an reflection of Google itself - a story still in the making. (Hence the 4.5*)    Overall, an excellent, informative, detailed look at a company that clearly has shaped our views on what information means or at least what accessibility to information should mean... Undoubtedly, the book to beat on Google.
0553386794|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\", by G.R.R. Martin, is the first novel in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, which is the gold standard of all fantasy sagas.  The first novel of the series is perhaps the best of the series to date, and stands as an excellent novel in its own right.<br /><br />The book does everything one could hope for in a fantasy series: Martin creates a complete world of many cultures, with many traditions and religions and a long history.  But in the forefront is a page-turner of a sprawling adventure story, filled with complex, fully drawn, and engaging characters.  And perhaps most surprising of all for a fantasy epic, the book is permeated with a gritty realism<br /><br />I initially read the series some five years ago.  The HBO production of \\"A Game of Thrones\\" and the immanent release of the next book in the series, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", prompted a re-read.  If anything, the book is better than I remembered.<br /><br />The only negative about the series is that the series is not yet complete, and will probably need at least two more volumes to wrap up the story.  Given Martin's glacially slow rate of output, that might not be until 2021.

B000QCS8TW|1.0|I found this book to be dry, boring, and VERY slow paced. It revolves around several characters and they each have there own storyline, which for me is totally awesome. However, I would like it if more than one of those storylines had an interesting plot to it. There were some interesting spots, but for the most part, it was pretty boring, I'm sorry to say... I simply could not finish it! And I tried really hard to get past the 2/3rds point, but then I gave up and just read the one plot line that interested me. The storyline was pretty cool and it was a good idea, but I think it was poorly exicuted. I mean, really, murdering a little boy? Was that neccesary? And all of the rape and other murders as well? Simply put, I did not like this book and dont understand the 5 star reviews.

140003180X|5.0|This is the fourth in the series of charming cozies set in Botswana, featuring Precious Ramotswe and her ever expanding circle of friends.  The stories in this series rarely deal with the usual mystery fare of dead bodies or missing treasures.  Mma Ramotswe's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency most often handles errant husbands, petty thefts and other more commonplace events.  Aided by her secretary/assistant detective Mma Makutsi have been in business for some time now and have managed to bring many of their cases to satisfactory conclusions.  They have even managed to solve some of their financial difficulties by moving their agency into unused space behind Mr J. L. B. Matekoni's Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors' Garage, a move that proved quite beneficial to all concerned.  Still all is not well in Mma Ramotswe's world, her already long engagement to Mr J. L. B Matekoni still has no end in sight and the No 1 Ladies Detective Agency is no longer Botswana's only detective agency.  Their competitor is a man who boasts of his vast experience with the CID and in New York causing both Precious and Mma Mukutsi to worry about their business' future.<br /><br />The stories in this series are sweet and gentle, fans of more hard boiled mysteries will probably wish to look elsewhere.  The emphasis in this series is very much on the 'cozy', the ongoing storylines involving Precious, Mma Makuti and Rra Matekoni rather than the cases the agency handles.  The overall story arc is quite pronounced, although a series synopsis is provided at the beginning of each new book fans of this series will want to begin at the beginning and proceed in order through this charming series.

Pros:    - Visually appealing interface  - Easy to use  - Found and synced to my Google calendars automatically the first time I started the app  - Events added to your calendar from your phone automatically sync to your online Google calendar, and vice versa  - Customizable widgets in a variety of sizes and formats for your home screens  - You can add a new event directly from the widgets  - On the Add and Edit Event screens, there's a small sidebar with your existing appointments on the selected day so you can easily see when your schedule is open  - In Month view, tapping on a day brings up a pop-up box with a list of your appointments for that day  - Appointment locations link to map    Cons:    - Widgets don't have touch scroll  - Widgets in Agenda view don't display today's date
1400031362|5.0|This is the third volume in the NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY and begins shortly after the events of TEARS OF THE GIRAFFE.    Precious Ramotswe, has taken the money left to her by her late father and opened Botswana's only detective agency.  The business has been a qualified success, that is Mma Ramotswe, aided by her secretary/assistant detective Mma Makutsi have brought numerous cases to satisfactory conclusions.  In addition on a more personal note Mma Ramotswe has recently accepted the marriage proposal of Mr J. L. B. Matekoni.  On those accounts Mma Ramotswe's life is quite good, even including the unexpected arrival of two orphans that her fiance had decided to foster without consulting her first.  On other accounts life has presented a few problems, the first being that although the Agency had been quite successful in solving cases it had not been very profitable, leaving Mma Ramotswe wondering how to keep the business open.  On a more personal level she was beginning to wonder of her fiance would ever set a date for their wedding.    This series of charming, cozy mysteries is set in Botswana and offers the reader a glimpse into life in the exotic locale.  The emphasis in this series is very heavy on the 'cozy' and very light on the 'mystery'.  Those looking for violence, and numerous dead bodies should look elsewhere.  The mysteries here are much more of the domestic variety, a wandering husband, some family conflicts are much more the normal fare here.  No matter though what the problems are Mma Ramotswe manages to sort through in her quiet manner to find the best solution.    The overall story arc to this series is quite strong so, even though each volume begins with a brief description of the earlier events, for maximum enjoyment begin at the beginning and read the novels in order.

My father, H.A.Stevenson, and E.B.White; were classmates at Cornell University, and life-long friends.  One of their classes at Cornell was an English course taught by Prof. Strunk; and the curriculum included the original edition of this book.  Early in 1957, White contacted my father; who was editor of the Cornell Alumni News; and asked about getting a copy of the book.  A copy of the book was sent to White.  The details of this exchange are contained in a letter from White to my father, which is published in the book; \\"Letters of E.B.White\\", on page 434. White's article about the book in his column in \\"The New Yorker\\", and his subsequent re-publication of an expanded edition of the book; gave it a whole new life. gks
B001EC3JME|2.0|Well, i don't like this item very much. It's too hard to insert even tiny flashlight into it. And it's also not so easy to take it out.   I'd better use some jacket to hold my flashlight.  May be if you do not need to take your flashlight into your hands and just use from your belt, than it's ok.  But if you need to hold flashlight by hand often and than put back into holster, than try to find some other item to carry it.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these headphones in October of 2009 and as of April of 2011, after daily use and abuse, they are still in excellent shape. I wear them 8 hours a day and have never had any serious discomfort at all. When I'm not using them, they live in my messenger bag with whatever else I am carrying around and, other than the cord getting tangled sometimes, I haven't had any problems with their durability. If anything ever happens to them, I will happily buy an identical set.
0307887960|5.0|Straight to the point....I lost 7lbs in 5 days!  Talk about motivated!  My plan started with 5 days, referred to in the book as the \\"Attack Phase\\" to motivate you to the next step.  The next step, which I'm on now is the \\"Cruise phase\\" where the weight loss slows down to 2lbs per week.  And that's fine with me and his plan to keep you from encountering the sagging skin phoenomena.<br /><br />I'm 52 years old and I haven't seen rapid weight loss in years.  Sure when I was in my twenties I could drop ten pounds in 10 days so when I got on the scale after the first day on the Dukan Diet and saw that I'd lost 4 lbs, I was ECSTATIC!<br /><br />On the other hand, I'd started Weight Watchers January 25, 2011 and as of April 19 I'd lost 12 lbs.  Enter the Dukan diet and we chalk up the grand total to 19.  The OTHER thing you'll like about this plan is that those weight measurements we were all given in high school---forget about them. I was told that at 5'7\\" I should weigh 115lbs back in the day.  Heck I think I weighed 115 when I was TWO.  Imagine how frustrating that was and how I had to learn to love myself at the size I was.<br /><br />Heck, I was 160 at age 14.  Dukan says my ideal weight should be 169!  So I'm 35 lbs away from that (instead of 89!) and from the Dukan calculations I should be at my ideal weight by my birthday, September 28.<br /><br />Soooo...pluses:  You can eat as much as you want on protein vegetable and pure protein days.

Because your body will be burning fat and eliminating waste, you don't want the waste trapped inside of you!<br /><br />Ignore the NAYSAYERS:  Sometimes people are just jealous that they don't have the courage or will power to take on a diet that virtually eliminates certain pleasures from your life.  So they discourage you and say how you'll get sick, its just a fad, etc.) The deprivation is 100% worth it!  You do this diet on your own power, no drugs,no stomach stapling...this is all you.

At the same time I'm listening to Pandora and a fair volume.<br /><br />my concerns when it arrived:<br />1. they're really big, are they going to be cumbersome and heavy?<br />2. the Mic. seems fairly far away from my mouth, I have enough problems with voice recognition as it is.<br /><br />what I found as soon as I started using it:<br />1. they're extremely comfortable.<br />2. A. fully cover my ears and block out extraneous noise.<br />3. except for some really high notes, the sound is great.<br />4. I've never had a microphone worked this well. It doesn't picked up any noise from the headphones, or from the surrounding environment, and is far enough from my mouth not to pick up breathing noises. At the same time it picks up my voice perfectly.<br />(update: Mic stopped working well after the first month or so)<br />oh, also they are big, but not cumbersome and not heavy. Your ears will get hot.<br />(The only cheating I did involved typing the numbers in changing Mike to mic.)
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is excellent. Well-written, gripping and easy to get lost in. You'll read it in one sitting, not able to put it down. I hated having to pause even for a moment while reading it. It's free, do yourself a favor and read it right now. Start before you're ready

044654759X|4.0|This is an amazing book that really show cases Nicholas Sparks' talents. The way Sparks can change from one mind to another is incredible. What is really impressive is the way that he can describe the mind of a clearly deranged man,  a woman who is emotionally distant accurately and a compassionate widow/father looking for a new love.That was one of my favorite part, the flip from Kevin to Katie/Erin to Alex. Another thing that makes this book great is the character development. The way he shows Katie open up and then the reasons she was closed made this book so addicting because you want to learn more about her troubled past.    This is a fantastic book, from the story line to the characters to the twists and turns this book takes. It is a thriller mixed with a love story. This book should definitely be placed in the \\"Sparks Hall of Fame\\" next to The Notebook. This book is appropriate for the high school age group and older because although it was not challenging to read, it contains some adult themes. This book exposes to the reader to a world many do not have very much knowledge of, the lives of domestic abuse victims. The way he describes her life with Kevin was so vivid it was sickening.

Now, it sits cooly in the 40's and is ready for a potential future overclock.  Install wasn't too tough, considering I didnt read the instructions and I am not that experienced in computer building (just finished my first ever build). I am running the cooler in a haf 912 case with a asus p8p67 pro motherboard and an intel i5 2500k at the heart of the system. Hope this helps!

B000FC2PKG|3.0|While this book is well written from a certain perspective, it's clearly more relevant for women.  It lacks the insight into what is mostly a man's world.  I know, I know, this ain't PC, but I mean it with real sincerity, and without malice.  I think women will appreciate it as a well written mystery/crime/detective story, but the men will find it a bit lacking from the perspective of what dealing with a real world situation would be like.  A bit too much drama, and not too believable because of it.  Certainly, a fun, easy read.
0618918248|4.0|If you are a fundamentalist Christian - do not read this book unless you are open to the possibility that you could be mistaken.<br /><br />If you detest science's shaping of our modern culture to illuminate human behavior - avoid this book at all costs.<br /><br />If you are unwilling to think critically against religious peer pressure - I advise you not upset your happy Christian life with these torrential critiques of your belief system.<br /><br />The God Delusion - By Richard Dawkins<br /><br />Picking up the audio version of this classic book prominent on nearly every atheist's bookshelf, I was immediately intrigued by the introduction.  Being reared in a dogmatic religious cult, my mind was shaped to believe in God and the unequivocal Truth in the Bible.  After all, God was the Creator, Omniscient, Omnipresent force NOT to be tempted.  I thoroughly ascribed to the Bible verse, \\"The fool hath said in his heart, there is no God.\\"  Why would I ever want to be deemed a fool?<br /><br />As many agnostics and atheists (from religious backgrounds) attest, their search for truth began years prior to their declaration as a bonified religious dissident.  Love him or hate him, Dawkins has illuminated the path to atheism since his own deconversion several years ago.  He has utilized his scientific background coupled with intellect to challenge proponents of religion from various professions and backgrounds.<br /><br />The God Delusion is his classical criticism of religion based upon scientific evidence and liberated freethinking.  He unabashedly attacks religion without paying it undue elevated status so prevalent in modern society.  Putting belief systems - specifically Christianity - to the test, he proceeds to answer a number of questions proposed by theologians worldwide.  He makes no apologies for his cursory disdain of religion.  Instead, he takes both the offensive position criticizing the God Hypothesis and a defensive stance on the necessity of God as the source of morality.<br /><br />The Four Main Points of the Book<br />According to Wikipedia<br /><br />\\"Dawkins writes that The God Delusion contains four `consciousness-raising' messages:<br /><br />  1. Atheists can be happy, balanced, moral, and intellectually fulfilled.<br />  2. Natural selection and similar scientific theories are superior to a `God hypothesis' --the illusion of intelligent design-- in explaining the living world and the cosmos.<br />  3. Children should not be labelled by their parents' religion. Terms like \\"Catholic child\\" or `Muslim child' should make people cringe.<br />  4. Atheists should be proud, not apologetic, because atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind.\\"<br /><br />While listening to this book in spurts of ten minutes here and two hours there over the course of a few weeks, I was able to process the information he provided at a digestible rate.  From my fundamental, evangelical Christian upbringing, I found dormant beliefs rising to refute his accusations but falling flat upon the evidence and intellectual arguments.  As an atheist birthed from insidious indoctrination, I noticed my prior disgust for Dawkins morph into esteem for a cerebral scientist and freethinker.  The God Delusion emotes his right-brained unshackled feelings while tempering itself with his left-brained requirement for proof.ok   According to Wikipedia    \\"Dawkins writes that The God Delusion contains four `consciousness-raising' messages:       1.

B002ZG977Y|4.0|My expectations were low going into this one, I guess that's why when the credits rolled I was surprised that I liked it so much.  I'm not a fan of a majority of the big budget hollywood remakes, but every once in a while a good one comes along.  The original, while it wasn't a kid's movie by any means, still had it's kiddie moments - thank god the irritating metal owl's screen time is kept to a minimum this time around.  The remake is much more adult-oriented, the effects are pretty impressive, and the story is pretty respectful of the mythology as well as the original movie.  None of the actors made much of an impresson though, aside from Liam Neeson who is great in just about anything he does.  Sam Worthington was...well.. Sam Worthington, but on the plus side - the scorpions are friggin' HUGE.  Not a perfect movie, but solid and entertaining nonetheless.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|So I just finish playing this game this morning and got the first ending. At first I found the game too much to read (I play Ace Attorney type of games so I'm use to text based games and still found it annoying at time). It over explained certain steps and there was no way to skip. But as I got more and more into thisgame I grew to love it. A couple of choices to make to determine the ending and that is what made me hook, replay value. The one thing I wish the game had was more graphics - call me sick if you want but I would have enjoyed seeing the blown up bodies instead of just reading about fat slowing sliding down the wall. A few extra images and some extra choices on the outcome of the game would have made me give it a full 5.  Still I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys puzzle type games. Just get though though the first part and you will be hooked!

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I just recently have gotten back into gaming and thought this might be a very useful weapon to use to kill foes =)  Unfortunately I think I am just not into gaming enough to see a benefit from it. I was hoping it would help my game by limiting the amount of keys I had to hit (or avoid miss-hitting) in the heat of battle but to be honest I didn't find it any help over my regular logitech gaming keyboard. I don't play games where u need lots of macro keys so I probably should of done more research and realized it had little additional to offer for my application. I mostly play games via steam or LoL, but I can see how this would be great for WOW people. As far as the build, setup and design I have only praise to give it. The display is nice, easy to read and the build quality is solid. The curvature of the keys was also a nice touch.
0441013597|5.0|I first read Frank Herbert's Dune perhaps twenty years ago during a long hot Sacramento summer. I worked at Toys -R- Us, a 3 mile walk from my grandmother's house, where I was living, as I enjoyed the bargain of low (okay, nonexistent) rent, and a mediocre job in the retail industry. Despite the hundred degree days (and intolerably bad traffic), I walked to work every day. I didn't savor being hit by a motorist careening through the Arden district. It took 45 minutes to an hour, and I often walked home, through East Sacramento, in the dark at 10 or 11 PM to return home.  Whenever possible, I had a book in my hand: this was where I learned to walk and read. Peripheral vision is my only physical gift from the gods, and I've used passionately it ever since. I've finished dozens of novels walking to-and-from work, or to classes. Dune was my first walking-and-reading adventure.<br /><br />I remember very little from my first reading of the novel.  I remember a young man with powers beyond those of his peers. And battleship-sized sand worms. And a planet so dry it made the Sahara seem downright moist. Mostly, I remember the love story between young Paul Atreides and his bride Chani, from his youthful visions. Maybe I was young and horny. I was living with a 90-year-old woman, and my libido was certainly not running unchecked at this point in my life. So when i recently picked up the book, about a month ago, I was expecting Dune to be, from my recollection, a beautiful Bedouin-like love story set on the desert planet called Arrakis.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe I should have paid closer attention to the book, and less attention to Sacramento traffic, all those years ago.  The first book had the love story (and the worms in the desert) to be sure, but I somehow missed all the political intrigue. I was at a point in my reading career where I wanted a book to get to the damn story, I suppose, and skipped over the first, say, 150 pages, where Duke Leto Atreides, Paul's father, was sent to Arrakis and the readers were struggling to uncover his potential assassin. We know from the excerpted writings of Princess Irulan that head each chapter that there will be one the desert call the Muad'Dib. We know The Duke will die, and Paul will go into exile. We know Paul's mother, Lady Jessica, will be suspected by many people of the treason that killed her husband. We just wait for it to unfold. The anticipation is enormous, and when it finally happens, the payoff is great. Herbert writes wonderful characters against a bleak desert backdrop. The Duke's real killer was the very nasty, very round Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who is perpetuating a longstanding feud between the Duke's house and his own. Behind all this intrigue are the Bene Gesserit sisterhood, who have a secret campaign to \\"breed\\" the greater houses and give birth to the one known as the  Kwisatz Haderach. The antagonists are nasty without being embarrassingly evil. Their motives seem reasonable, if not to us, at least to them. You can picture some politician making the same decisions as the Baron, or trying the same manipulative policies of the Bene Gesserit. They're not simply antagonistic for the sake of the plot.<br /><br />Yep. Rather than being the love story that I fondly remembered, Dune is the story of a desert messiah: one who would bring peace and order to the universe. Oddly, I missed that minor detail during the first reading.<br />Herbert's backdrop is rich: amazingly so.  When you step into the world of Arrakis, you finding yourself needing a drink of water. When you read about Harkonnen schemings, your mind wanders down the myriad paths that may possibly allow Paul Atreides to escape the designs of multiple political camps. It is rare both the story and the characters in a novel have such depth and richness.<br /><br />And I must say this: Dune stands on its own. I was satisfied with its ending. Twenty years ago, I didn't want to leave the characters. I needed them to be alive awhile longer, so knew what happened to them. During this reading, I realized they'd be all right. It's how Herbert intended them to be: they were painted correctly in the first book of many to eventually be delivered from this author, and eventually, his son Brian. But I urge readers to stop with the first one. You can still love the characters, and enjoy the intrigue, perhaps even more so, without knowing what happened to them. Each book afterwards just seems to weaken the power of the first story.<br /><br />I would also recommend, perhaps, sitting on a sofa and reading the book. Definitely not a commuter pamphlet, like so many I have read in the past.  You can try, but you will miss a lot of the power of the story if you don't give Frank Herbert's Dune the attention it deserves.ed to them. During this reading, I realized they'd be all right.

159420229X|5.0|I have always been intrigued and fascinated about the art of remembering, of memory...how we remember what we do...and why...so this book caught my eye immediately. I really did not buy it to learn how to necessarily improve my memory, but more for discovering and reading about the author's research and experiences while exploring this topic. I did NOT view it as a self help book and really, if one reads the synopsis of the book on the cover, it does not really profess to be such. The writing is smart, accessible, and entertaining, too. One of the very best non fiction books so far this year.

1416583408|2.0|Uh Veh!  If I was pursuing an advanced degree in animal sciences, this book would be appropo.  I guess that I am not as brainy as the author to spell the word correctly.  She knew that this book was being written to the masses in general.  She lacks the ability to engage the layperson.  The average person like myself simple is picking up the book to know what our treasured pet is feeling and experiencing.  We are not pursuing college credit on the subject.  As a busy mom taking a few minutes of \\"me time\\" to read about beloved dogs, I am so disappointed.  Such an intelligent woman markets a book to the general population and makes it so painful to get to the heart of the matter.  I think that she has a need for people to be impressed by her intelligence, otherwise she wouldn't have written a mainstream book in such a scientific fashion.  I actually feel sorry for this woman.    I think that I will take the time to read the positive reviews to get the main idea of the book.  Busy mommies don't have time for this nonsense.  She is what the expression refers to a \\"book smarts, not people smarts\\".  Go back to writing text books!

B0015DROBO|3.0|The most disturbing thing about this book is the sociology it supports.  If the book's attitudes about relationships and sex reflect mainstream Swedish attitudes then it is no mystery why they don't bother reproducing.  Here are some of the things the Millennium series says:<br />- Marriage does not matter<br />- Fidelity in marriage is optional and everyone should be happy about it<br />- Sex casual and has nothing to do with relationships<br />- Homosexuality is great fun even if you are not homosexual<br />- Western countries like to hassle Muslims for no reason<br />- Liberal good, Conservative bad<br /><br />The story itself, when the author gets around to telling it, is interesting.  The characters are mostly one dimensional but its no so horrible that it spoils the book.  Most disappointing is that these books were a missed chance to tell important stories about real issues.  Violence against women is a real problem, human trafficking and the sex trade are real problems, and adult onset adolescence is a real problem.  Unfortunately Larsson spends too much time glorifying the latter while sacrificing attention to the others.

B004FOA84A|4.0|I liked it. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.  I don't like this 20 word minimum.  stupid Amazon.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This app works just fine and synchronizes with my gmail accounts and with my organization's MS Exchange calendar.  I really like the look of the widget on my home screen.  It uses a smaller font and fits more details into the same size widget.  The month calendar is great as or allows me to browse through the months and selectively chow details for certain dates without going to the event page.  The look of the app is as advertised. Business.  It's not there to look pretty or compliment your background.  It's there to do it's job.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great app and a huge improvement over the stock calendar and anything else available.  Its easy to navigate and syncs with my calendar without flaw. A couple of changes could include the current date on the widget and also to be able to scroll on the widget itself.  Otherwise awesome plain and simple.  Great functionality!!
B0034JGBM0|2.0|The White Stripes is my favorite band, probably of all time. It is so depressing to find out that this is most likely their final album. It fails as a live album. I can appreciate the different takes on some of their songs, but it just doesn't make for a good listen overall. At least I'll always have their previous classic albums. Just a note: the dvd that goes with this album is great and should be seen.
031603438X|5.0|What a GREAT book and a surprise read. A fascinating look at the behind the scenes of Keith Richard's life. In spite of his celebrity-his life parallels soo many of us growing up during the best years of rock-n-roll.I came away with, in spite of the facade of a rock-n-roll life style- Keith is the real deal-one of the most authentic guitarist of our time. Thank you Keith-for always being you!! Not one ounce of narcissism in his memories-not like some other guitarists' memoirs. I have recommended this book to many friends.
B0001LJCMK|4.0|These guys are sure to piss off some people with their ironic name. They are not death metal, or metal period. If you like Queens of the Stone Age, you will like these guys though. This isn't the first album I've heard from them, and they got a bit cheesier with their next two albums. This is their best.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|In college I had the choice of being a Business Major or Computer Science Major. It was a hard choice, but I ultimately chose CS because the classes looked like a lot more fun. Because of this I have decided to give myself a business education so I do a lot of reading on business. Of all the books I have read so far this one has been one that has made me think a lot about the different growth levels beyond a cursory glance.    This book has really made me think and while some of it isn't new information it is presented very well. I think if you are going to start a business and move past being just a consultant or freelancer you have to read this book.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I've tried a few calendar widgets, and this one does the best job with my calendar. It's far more readable than the others, and you can actually scroll the display without opening the full calendar. I highly recommend this app. Nexus One/2.3.3.
