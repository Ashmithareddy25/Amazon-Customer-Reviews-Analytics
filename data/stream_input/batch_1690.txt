B008GVD6D8|4.0|Another really good read by slyvia Day. It is certainly up there with Fifty Shades of Grey. Found it hard to put down
B001I9WK14|5.0|The U2: Rattle and Hum DVD is a great time machine back to the '80s when U2 had it all.  The documentary/stage performance combo gives a great insight into what made them such a great band and fueled their present mark on the music industry.  Now they are much older men, their music is still off the edge.. but in 1986, the charisma came across on that stage.  Bono gave everything then.. and now he seems so much more reserved.  I liked the Bono of Rattle and Hum.  He has evolved, but his earlier performances were true charisma.<br />I know that at this time we can not time travel, but this DVD is the next best thing to it.  Pop it in the DVD player or instantly download it, set some pure uninterrupted viewing time aside and hit the play button.  The trip is well worth the time.
B002LFPAUC|2.0|This DVD set is a real disappointment.  I love the series, but am very annoyed about the quality of the disc.  It skips and gets stuck on certain episodes. Why is that happening? I just opened it, put it in the dvd player and thats all.<br /><br />I do have to say though, that Amazon is doing a great job about this.  I've contacted them and they are sending a replacement with a return shipping label to send back the defective one at no charge.  So bravo Amazon for correcting this problem so efficiently!  Thanks!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Sylvia Day has yet to disappoint, her work is great and I catch myself hanging on her every word. It is a real love story with passion, problems and everything in between.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it use to work but now it doesn't let me do anything. i uninstalled this app from my kindle fire
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World is a most enjoyable, thought-provoking read.  Follett once again takes the reader into another era where the fictional characters are believable while set in actual historical events.  Since history is usually written by the victors, Follett gives the reader an interesting, believable look at \\"the other sides\\".  While the interconnectedness of the characters is a bit of an stretch of the imagination, it makes for a good story.  Without such connections there would be no \\"story\\", just history.  Looking forward to Book Three and the next generation.
B00628RVV0|5.0|This here was well written story and a sad one at that I really did enjoy watch it but did have tears as the story went through.  I do recommend watching this film.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app! Comes in handy in many different situations! I love it! Will recommend it to family and friends.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very great and customizable. You can use your own music so you're not waking up to something annoying. And its free!!! Highly recommend it.
B004GBFF5Y|4.0|I had seen the previews on Movies on Demand but could never remember the title. Alas, I remembered and SO happy I did. I loved the movie. It was perfect for my life at the moment.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It just wasn't nearly as funny as I thought it would be. Good plot but I guess I came in expecting to laugh a lot more. My fiancé is an easy laugh so when she wasn't either I knew it wasn't just me.
B008US4PBY|5.0|I've owned other cross over controller adapters and this one is by far the best one out. Not only did I not notice any lag in response, but very easy to configure buttons, installation is simple, and works as promised. No complaints from here. I've been looking for something that will let me use my 360 controller on my PS3 and this is it. If you're like me and prefer the 360 controller over the PS3 controller, and prefer the PS3 console over the 360 console, then get this one to have you're cake and eat it too!!!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|Great intensity throughout the book. I couldnt wait to see what happened next. i will definitely check out other works by Blake Crouch.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I purchased this on a whim and read it in a few nights. It's premise is not new, however the story was well written with very good characters. The author spends just the right amount of time developing the characters as the plot line plays out. I had a hard time visualizing the silos and their size and layout. The fact that it took so long for one to travel top to bottom was a bit difficult to grasp. I recommend this highly. I think it would make a great movie.
B000FBFM9S|2.0|Very hard to get into.  Was not an easy read.  If you had patience you might enjoy it but it was not by any means a quick read.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|just finished the third grey wow wow! that is all can say! amazing! loved all of them please write more!
B004I3U7US|5.0|wow. when i first heard this in my car, one of six cd's and i had forgot who it was, i was struck. it sounded like a younger version of patti smith, powerful, rebellious, anthemic, if that is a word. she is just great. i dont want to take away from her by the comparison, she is not really derivative but listen for the parentage.<br /><br />cant wait for next one
B001HZK8FO|4.0|The movie is great, the case and everything that came in the box is perfect. I hadn't seen the extras but I think it has to be as good as the movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The only bad thing I have to say about it is that once I get on I find it hard to get off of it!
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|These superheroes actually saved New York wow how did they do it. Excellent footage. I want to get Captain America's autograph. It's amazing how the hulk didn't kill anyone. I saw the whole invasion on the news and this film filled me in on the details.
B004FOA84A|5.0|great game...lots of fun and is challenging! i would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure games! play it today!
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game. Works great. I like it that I can connect to facebook because I have previously played on my computer.
B007STBUIW|5.0|First of all the video quality is a huge jump over the full screen DVD I owned before purchasing this. The fact that it comes with a digital copy and a standard DVD is great too giving you the option to watch it anywhere on whatever format. The special features were also quite interesting. I normally don't review movies on amazon but I felt like I should in this instance. Overall this is one of the best blu-ray purchases I've made and was definitely worth the upgrade over DVD. This is exactly how classic movies should be released on blu-ray.
B001R60ESE|5.0|It is just an incredible concert, the audio and the image are great. I test it on my Home Theater and i t sounds great, simply recommended.
B004UAKAE2|5.0|I first started watching this in honor of my mother who watched it in the 1970s, when I was busy with school and, perhaps, too young for it. Now, in my middle years, I find it fascinating. The first season begins more lightly, but as it develops, the series touches on so many important historical events, making them very personal. There's women's suffrage, the sinking of the Titanic, World War I, promiscuity, children born out of wedlock, miscarriage... all seen through the eyes of those who live downstairs, the servant class, and those who live upstairs, the privileged.  No one is a stereotype, for as the times change, the people either change with them, or stay stuck in the past, or run toward the future. I don't know how long it goes on, but I hope to watch it all, and I'll certainly regret it when it ends.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could not put the book down! It was like sitting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next. Highly recommend it!
B0061PEAUY|2.0|I have read all of the Dr. Brennan books and I found this one to be too technical.  The story was not very well developed and I got very bored reading it.  I was glad when I finished the book.  I have never watched the television show, but I feel the emphasis is not on the original Tempe anymore.  I will give the series one more try before I move on.  I have spent many years with this series and I am disappointed.
B009FOBMBI|4.0|I was really excited for this album based on the past 3 days grace music which they have put out. If my expectations werent so high I probably would have liked this a lot more. The album has about 3-4 songs which I love, followed by 3 songs which are just alright and about 2 songs which annoy the heck out of my after the 3rd time I hear them...overall worth getting but its not amazing
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Once I watched &quot;You Tube&quot; on how this program could help me organize it has become indispensable tool. Try it for sure.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder was a great book. It made you stop and see the world through someone else's view. I defiantly recommend this book and when my children become old enough to read this will be a must. No matter what age this book makes you realize that we all are more similar than different.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|My boss repeatedly badgered me to give The Walking Dead a try.<br /><br />\\"Eeh\\" I replied, \\"I'm not really a zombie killing type of girl.\\"<br /><br />\\"Trust me,\\" he said.<br /><br />Sooooo, last Sunday night I watched a couple of episodes from season two and watched the premiere of season three and I became officially hooked.  Gulp....I am now a walker fan.<br /><br />I decided that I needed to play catch up, so I purchased season one and season two and now my Husband, who isn't really a zombie killing kind of guy, is hooked.<br /><br />Give The Walking Dead a try.  There is so much more to it than zombies trying to kill humans and vice versa.  There are great plots, great characters and a writing style like no other. Kudos to the writers for their superb job of keeping us entertained!<br /><br />How can I be so enthralled with a television show about zombies?  I don't know how....but I am.<br /><br />In the words of my boss, \\"trust me\\".
1423140605|5.0|I love the Lost Hero series and this next chapter is no exception.  I would always recommend this series for pretty much any age group.  Even though this is designed for teenagers, you can still enjoy as an adult.
B001RIY4WE|1.0|This was a great price for a blu ray of this movie so i jumped on it before the price changed.  However, when loading the disc in one of my players, it just sat there and would never load.  I checked my firmware to make sure it was up to date and it was.  So i tried it in my other player.  This time it loaded but trying to get through the menu just to get to the movie was a long process, almost 5 minutes which is too long to have to navigate through a menu.  Badly designed if you ask me. Once i got to the movie i was not happy with the sound.  It was just plying in stereo and i have a pretty good surround sound system.  I went and checked the set up menu for audio and everything was correct for surround and i double checked my  receiver settings and they were correct  but still only sound through the front left and right channel.  I returned it the next day.  Maybe that is why it was only $5.  You really get what you pay for.  Maybe th e fact that Skynet Edition is in the title has something to do with it and maybe it works well on computers,  But that is not what i was looking for.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|You really can't go wrong with Sons of Anarchy. The twists and turns always leaving you on the edge of your seat. You can't but help to get so into the show that you think the characters are real.
B005LAII1C|4.0|Why would you see the movie if you didnt want crude stupidity?  It was AWESOME.  Just no kids, please, dont let kids watch this ronchy masterpiece of a  film. Its so wrong on so many levels! So says the child of the eighties. Loved it.
0393088731|5.0|I was really excited when this book came out, and was glad to get it brand new for a great price. the book is very good!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I almost couldn't put it down. If you like sex and dominance than this book is for you. I thought it was a fun fiction book. It was an easy read. I enjoyed it.
B00004YRQA|5.0|What else can I say except it gets the job done.  I have six more words to type this review.
1619695006|4.0|In retrospect, I am not sure there was one functional character in the entire book.  No doubt the author posesses writing skills, but if you thought there were dark characters in the Harry Potter series, hang on to your reading seat, you are in for a rough ride.  Redeeming values are few and far between.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really enjoyed the ending.  I was worried when Alice & Jasper left thinking that the ending couldn't be where they all died!  Especially with Edward & Bella just finally getting together as immortals and what they went through.  I would recommend this book and series to anyone.  Young readers and adults.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game because its free and its a mystery. and it is fun and I don't if its
0062127241|4.0|I've been a fan of British rock music for decades, and I try to read every biography and autobiography that's published that relates to the music of the 1960s--1980s.  Pete Townshend's new autobiography is a thoroughly interesting read throughout.  As some reviewers have noted, Townshend can at times appear to be somewhat egotistical, but that's part of what has given him his tremendous drive as an artist since the early 1960s. Who I Am provides insight into the inner psyche of its author, and goes a long way in explaining why his compositions (especially the lyrics) are the way they are.  One of the things that was exceptionally strong about Keith Richards's recent autobiography was the Rolling Stones' guitarist's discussion of technique (guitar tuning systems and their impact on the sound of Rolling Stones songs, etc.).  It would have been nice for Townshend--one of the most iconic guitarists of the 1960s and 1970s--to have included more in the way of nuts and bolts about his music and his guitar techniques.  And, if some of the discussion of his sexual encounters had to be edited down to make room, it would not have been a loss.  Still, Who I Am reads very well and gets at Townshend's motivations, demons, successes, and his entire life in a way that previous Who biographies just don't.  Thanks, Mr. Townshend, for taking us inside your life!
0312360258|2.0|I hate giving books low reviews, I really do. However, the story presented by the Cast's really isn't very good. Great premise, horrid execution.<br />Zoey here is a fledgling vampire (or is it 'vampyre'? I've forgotten already), who gets sent to the titular House of Night by her religious freak family (which I will describe later in this review). She there meets others of her kind and learns how special she is. Then she does something heroic and becomes even more special. The end.<br />Not the best summary, but it'll have to do.<br />The characters did not have any life to them. The majority of the cast was one-dimensional with little other personality than 'yeah, Zoey's right!'. If they weren't following the lead protagonist blindly, they hated her with very little reason. Zoey herself was probably the biggest Mary Sue since Bella Swan of the Twilight fame because of her petty personality and whiny voice. She had no character development at all and the supporting cast wasn't any better. Her voice was very childish and I cannot believe how annoying I found it when she used terms like 'bull-poopy'. Usually terminology like that doesn't bother me, but I believe when you need to curse, do it! These non-curses happening side by side with an explicit sexual scene doesn't make any sense. It doesn't help these strange euphemisms occurred on every other page. It also seemed like the authors were trying too hard to connect to their teenage audience with references blunter than a baseball bat to the head. It's on par with Lemony Snicket's love of explaining the meaning of words to people, except its far less charming.<br />The authors also made it seem like every single christian in this novel was nothing but a religious zealot with not a single shred of sympathy. I don't know what happened to them, but it came across as incredibly infuriating to me. Zoey's family is the pinnacle of 'useless adults' in young adult fiction. Everything in this novel is in black and white. There are two distinct sides: right and wrong. And Zoey's always right.<br />Don't get me wrong, the novel had its upsides. I thought the beginning was alright. It kind of got worse from there.<br />If this novel had stronger characterization and voice, it would've been ten times better. I might've enjoyed it then. But that and the cliche love triangle got in the way of my enjoying the novel.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|It was an interesting concept. I worry about all the violence in movies today and why it has become so fascinating to us all.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game that continues to challenge the player. Game play steps up as you progress through the game. Really enjoying the game.
0345803493|5.0|I read all three and if I have to pick just one - this would be my favorite. It was so jam packed with.... EVERYTHING. I am not even sure how Ana could take all of that in - I was already having a hard time reading it. Well EL has done it again - great, amazing, sexy book!
B001NEK2GE|3.0|I picked this up to run beside my Logitech G110 Keyboard and G300 mouse. I received it early, hooked it up and tested it out.<br /><br />-The G13 is a bit larger than I anticipated which is great in terms of key spacing, but terrible in terms of comfort. Having smaller hands, I found it a bit difficult to find a comfortable placement of my wrist/palm on the device which makes using it for any length of time challenging.<br />-The thumbstick is worthless, as many reviews have noted, and not even worth bothering with.<br />-THe back-lighting is nice, offering a wide range of colors if that is what you're into. The Logitech software allows application specific color options which is great, especially with other G-series products.<br />-The response of the keys is fine if you are a more deliberate, perhaps heavy-handed, gamer. I found them too soft with too much travel before the key-press is registered. Many reviews said that the buttons are similar to G110/G510 keyboards, but I found this not to be true. If I had to make a comparison, I'd say using the G13 is like driving a car with soft brakes: you'll get the desired result, you just have to push further.<br />-Key spacing, however, is fantastic. I have the unfortunate habit of wandering off of the WASD keys because they are so close to others on my keyboard, but the indented G4, G10, G11, and G12 keys are easy to find without looking and the spacing between the G-keys eliminates wandering fingers for me. Most of the G-keys are easily reached without moving my hand.<br />-Outside of gaming (I used this primarily with World of Warcraft), the device is basically useless. The screen is bright and distracting when not needed and the G13 has a sizable footprint. The screen defaults to an RSS feed reader which I actually like. There is on-screen volume level bars which would be great if Windows 8 didn't have its own system volume slider that popped-up on the monitor. The included applets for the G13's screen are nothing to write home about; there is a stopwatch, the RSS reader, profile switcher, and media info panel when iTunes is open.<br /><br />Overall, I am having a hard time finding a use for it due to comfort issues. It's become just another device to turn off at night using up a USB port. For now, its primary role is quick communication via pre-programmed macros for WoW.write home about; there is a stopwatch, the RSS reader, profile switcher, and media info panel when iTunes is open.<br /><br />Overall, I am having a hard time finding a use for it due to comfort issues.

B008NABUU8|5.0|This is a great app it has a good interface and really good graphics. its is very fun and very addictive its my new favorite app.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I have owned these only for two months, so I cannot comment on long-term durability. Yet they feel solid, and I hope that they will last. The main advantage of these utensils over the competition are the knobs that keep them from touching the tabletop. It is so simple and useful that it is a wonder why not all utensils have this. The colors are pleasant. Both me and my wife are happy with this purchase.    UPDATE: After more than 2yrs of use, these are still good.
B008MM9630|5.0|This game is really good! I was skeptical at first since its hard to find a farming game that can give up to farmville but I feel this game is just as good. While there isn't as much option in the game (as to what you can grow and buy) its a good amount! while any player would want more, I feel with updates its great! Also  it does a superb job on graphics and animation!  Crystals are easy to get but you require a bunch to purchase magical creatures. I feel that this system of exclusive money is much eaiser on the game then farmville was. Good for all ages! (17 here) and all genders!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|its really fun even though its challenging. sweeet ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !  have fun playing this fun challenging game.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|another great percy story,almost felt like a roller coaster!!!!! thank goodness my 4th grade teacher read the very first percy jackson book!!
B008X8QCTO|1.0|I purchased this game not knowing you have to pay as you go.  I am very dissatisfied with it. It freezes as well. I cant go any further.  I will not purchase another game from these people.<br /><br />Joy
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book.  It kept my interest and had me wanting more. Can't wait to start the second book.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wow...emotional terrorism! Have Kleenex ready...I can not believe this never made it to theaters in the U.S.  I don't care who you are, if this movie doesn't stir your emotions then you need a heart check. A movie for everyone!
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game! simple to use. ads are minimal. never freezes. easy to read. fun to play ..keeps me up at night!
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|Great product--has helped me get life out of my old firewire 400 devices--solid design--highly recommended--I had some older drives that I needed to transfer data off of and this was the answer.  Also use it with a old firewire 400 cf card reader I have--works great
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie was action, simply put. I wasn't there for a plot, romance, or well thought out character development. I was there to see Dredd shoot things and make dry one liners. That's why I LOVED it.<br /><br />Tentatively seeing a release date of December 29th through various outlets. The Judge will provide a happy new year.
B00913P6G0|5.0|Just the album cover alone makes this a classic (so real he has a mini van on the deluxe cover to represent the struggle how deep is that not a phantom or lambo like most of deez wack mc's represent while they steady cover up no rap skills in exchange for fashion smh) Kendrick is true to his lyrics all the way down to his appearance. He's like the west coast version of j.cole both artist have more to offer to this hip hop game. Whole album is nice!!
B008F5YDRI|1.0|Well if you are looking for a faith based movie - this is not one.  Don't be fooled by the previews. We thought this was a PG movie... glad the kids weren't watching.  There is plenty of cursing, foul language, adulterous behavior, disrespect, sinful angry parenting, typical \\"when marriage gets tough just divorce\\", self-centered individuals, sex, etc.... It could of been a good movie.  It had talented actors, beautiful back drops, scenery, it was well filmed and crafted... but that all means nothing when you add in all the negatives I mentioned.  It's just garbage and worthless- even if there is this little glimmer of hope at the end.  Salmon Fishing in the Yemen not what it is proposed as in the previews.  Not satisfied.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Maybe I was expecting too much since I have loved all the other books in the series. My son who usually reads a new book in ts series...non stop ..has not been really into this one . It seemed to move a little slow but some of the parts were still very entertaining ( the battle with the giants)
0385344228|4.0|This book was very good.  I loved the sort of twist in the ending. Def. recommend this one.  Makes you think about the what ifs in life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thought this was predictable, but the twists and turns were surprising. Stick with it and see. Is more interesting as it develops.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Without saying too much this was a great read that I could hardly let go of...and completely sad it had to end.  I am on to her earlier novels now and can not wait to see what she publishes next!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|My favorite in the series keeps you reading and willing to lose sleep  because you are drawn into the story
B00005JMK0|5.0|This movie has everything a great movie should. A love story, compelling and likable characters and awesome music. No DVD collection can be complete without this movie.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is so much fun and very addictive. Runs great on my kindle fire. Gaining levels seems like it could be nerfed a bit, though.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book, hope there is a 3rd in the series. Wonderful love story of sharing, opening up and healing. Would like to read more from this author.
B001223BLU|5.0|If you like oldies or just good music then this cd is great. The hits go  on and on good singing  fun songs  you cant go rong.
B0063GORYU|4.0|My standby game when I have a few mintues to play.  I like being able put it down and pick it up later.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|This is fun. I love watching this. I love it as much as downton abby. It great if you liked cranford and downton then your going to want to see this too.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not the usual Lee Child, Jack Reacher style, I found it tough going for the first half of the book. Lee normally jumps right into the plot and it is hard to put down reading, this one was hard to pick up reading. Still a big fan but just not the best Jack Reacher that I have read for continuous thrilling reading.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book drew me in and i had a hard time putting it  down. I do like the idea of children killing children, but the means of survival were very authentic.
B0086700CM|5.0|okay if you like time consuming games than temple run is right for you. I love it and it takes a while to play-ehich is completley a good thing! but it sometimes freezes up but you have to tap on it a few times and it should be okay. it is such a popular game so you can compare scores with friends or.... oh! also you can win points from the game(you don't have to use real money if you don't want to)... BEST GAME EVER! SO VERY ADDICTIVE!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I had three separate people (whose opinions I value) in the course of two days tell me I absolutely HAD to get this book.  How could I resist?  The book started out interesting enough, but I kept wondering when it was going to start to live up to the recommendations.  By the time I was half way through the book, I realized there wasn't a single character I liked or was rooting for.  At the end of the book, the only character I wanted to see more of was the misogynistic abusive old man.  To be fair, the writing itself is very well done, but the story left me cold.
B002XTBEDI|3.0|This season is not as good as the first. I felt they had added corny actors that were just supid not funny. I loved the first season but this one was not up to the standards they set.
B000001EKX|5.0|this album rocks, its still as awesome today as when i first laid my ears on it. this sort of music urges you to pick up a guitar and learn how to rock, which is what i did when i heard it for the first time, strange ways & goin blind are the stand out tracks for me.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Really enjoy the storyline, the music, and the challenge. Also like that the game doesn't seem to want to kill you off; it keeps giving you another chance to clear the level. Very enjoyable to play.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Gillian Flynn is a genius, this story is totally the work of brilliance, it is crazy and yet so believable. Somehow the characters can be related to people I know and that is scary!
B007KOYEOC|2.0|Slightly entertaining soft porn for the lonely hearts club. Closet nymphomaniac- masochist who thinks she is a grey mouse but is (of course) in reality a very beautiful young woman meets sex addict and sadist \\"Bill Gates\\" type  character who just happens to look like a young Brad Pitt with brains and tons more money. She tries of course very hard  to save him from his demons while suffering through kinky sex,  multiple orgasms and her new jet set lifestyle. A page turner that won't win the author any literary awards for writing excellence but probably a few for sales generation. The motion picture  with just the  minimal effort will be better.
B002PLALCO|5.0|If you love Pink, you'll enjoy owning this dvd. The music is great from her hard rock songs to her sensitive, right into your heart songs. Pink has great energy in this show and I'm amazed at what she can do. I love her and her music and this dvd gives you front row seats to a great concert.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I thought this book was very good.  I bought the ebook, but got lost in all the legal stuff.  It was a little hard for me to keep up.  Maybe it was just me.  I had someone give me the audio and I then really enjoyed it.
0062197258|5.0|I could not put this book down--it is one of the best suspense books I've ever read! I don't write book reviews, but I had to recommend this one.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I thought the movie was exciting, interesting, fun, and humorous. One of my favorite \\"new\\" movies- loved it. I recommend this for anyone who likes good movies.
B009UQCD0K|5.0|and so, I love every episode ever made, including this one.  Some very tough choices are made by the survivors of our little group.

B008EZVNO0|4.0|Musically pegged in the past with the blues, jazz and soul that will never leave his radar, Van delivers a good one this time around. Though it may not convert any non-believers, Van's own sax playing works and it keeps improving plus he selects a choice band - though at times the drummer lacks punch. He opens with a powerful personal soul-based cut and closes out with his leftist realism quite literally spelled out. In between, he resurrects his 1993 instrumental, \\"Close Enough for Jazz\\", and adds lyrics of reassurance. One of Van's strengths has always been his ability to say so much in so few words. And it stands out in the jazzy, \\"If In Money We Trust\\", where greed acquiesces to nothing for nothing else can seem to feed that vacany. His wit is in the pocket on the jazzy delight, \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo\\", with its \\"playing in the background in the restaurant, some kind of phony pseudo jazz\\". On the same cut, when he says \\"got to get myself together, gotta get my head some peace\\", Van vividly captures his lifelong loner tendencies. On his titanic Mississippi blues, \\"Pagan Heart\\", I'm not sure that Van's ever been more inhabited in his music. It's magnetic and a career highlight for him. He needs no plan B because man he was born to sing and he still can. By the way, the liner notes to this make for revelatory reading.
B005Q6TBOO|1.0|I watched this movie because the first one was kind of funny, and this one would be taking place in a city that I love. However, it was very disappointing. A recycled script to say the least. No originality from the first movie other than a change in location and, in this, an opportunity to get trashy by incorporating only the stereotyped aspects of the seediest side of Bangkok. End credit photos are truly unnecessary and shouldn't be viewed by anyone not old enough to buy porno magazines. I hate even including that in my review, as it will may prompt someone to watch or buy the movie out of curiosity.  Would not recommend wasting your time or money.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I really enjoy my cover---light weight and carries easily!! Can be easily detected because of color---the red is really vibrant.
B000MKD9P6|5.0|this is not a dreadfully serious film, and it is a lot of fun.  A young woman who could care less about the inside circle fashion world of NYC gets a job inside that circle...like many of us, she is clueless about the cult and workings of the fashion world.  She gets her eyes opened, and her wardrobe updated, on this romp through the stages and divas and fashion darlings.  She loses herself along the way, and realizes eventually that she may have traded away more of herself than she bargained for.  Will she abandon her former dreams of journalism?  Will she be seduced by thousand dollar shoes and handbags?  Will her moral compass be forever damaged by her exposure to this insanity?  I'm not telling...this movie is fun, fast paced, and very sharply witty...watch it.

B009AMALGM|5.0|I think that the Paranormal Activity franchise keeps getting better with each release. My favorites are still #1 and #2, but what I like with these releases is the new ways the creative cast keep using the video camera in different ways. Instead of walking around with a camcorder, they used security footage in #2, older style VHS camcorders on an oscillating fan in #3, and now, SKYPE and video chatting footage in #4. The central source for the activity is still with the demon and Katie, but now the story has evolved to how each new cast is going to figure out how to put an end to the evil that has manifested itself over the history of this family. I look forward to each new film to see what is going to be presented next. I still believe that this franchise has much more to deliver.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|If you loved book 1 Bared to You, you will want to read book 2:  Reflected in You.  The book continues the story of Gideon and Eva and how they work to make their relationship work.  This book gives you a deeper look into Gideon's past and what has caused his nightmares.  Eva's past threatens to end their relationship and their freedom.  I know you will love this book as much as I did, and will get you prepared for the finale in book 3.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Second installment of the Century Trilogy.  This is an excellent read.  Moves faster than the first installment. Very entertaining as are all of Ken Follett's books.
0817439390|5.0|I started my amateur journey in photography more than 40 years ago. Back then, the 35mm SLR camera I bought was so advanced that it had through the lens metering with a match needle method of setting what we would now call manual exposure (a Minolta SRT-101 in case anyone cares). I was in high school and also used cameras with no exposure meters at all for the yearbook! For those both new to photography and those with some experience I would say that getting your head around exposure (aperture, shutter speed, ISO) is so fundamental that this knowledge is the gateway to everything else in photography. This is the place to start and Peterson does a good job of breaking this down for the beginner and reinforcing this knowledge for those like me who learned the hard way.<br /><br />In addition to explaining exposure in great detail, Peterson also presents foolproof methods for at least getting to a starting point for proper exposure. I was also struck by his excellent description of how polarizers work and why they can sometimes either not work or give unexpected results. It's funny how one can zero in on the little things.<br /><br />After reading this book, I like many others would recommend the Scott Kelby boxed set of books.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0321839951 Scott Kelby's Digital Photography Boxed Set, Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4]]<br /><br /> I would also recommend the following:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000YN0VWU ExpoImaging ExpoAperture2 Depth-of-Field Guide - 2-Disc Kit]]<br /><br />Peterson's recommendations for establishing depth of field by choosing an aperture and distance setting are aimed at beginners who can only absorb one or two answers to these questions. I can't fault him for taking this approach. In reality though, the whole subject of depth of field is more complicated and can't be satisfied by a one or two word answer. Buy the ExpoImaging disks and with a glass of wine spend an hour in your living room playing with the calculators. When you go out in the field (withdisks) you will have a much better grasp of the subject and can apply this knowledge with much better accuracy. This would be a refinement to Peterson's advice and my only real nitpick for a truly excellent book.

B008IZYW3U|5.0|I have little exposure to opera, but when I saw that violin genius David Garrett had worked on this I read further.  I did like Freddie Mercury with Bohemian Rhapsody and the story about his work on this had me hooked.  I took a chance and pre-ordered the new version.  WHAT A PRIZE!  The music is the type of thing that stays with you all day.  Every so often, you can hear shades of \\"Queen\\" in it - a good thing.  Ms. Caballe has an incredible voice and the blend with Mr. Mercury is truly a wonder.  My favorite song is \\"The Fallen Priest\\" whose agony can be heard in the words and expressions of those who sing it.  (Words were a collaboration with Tim Rice.)  David Garrett adds his magic to \\"How Can I Go On\\" for another fine song.  If you have an open ear to a musical adventure, this album is for you!

0399157565|2.0|For those of you who have read the last three or four of Cornwell's disasters, I will say Bone Bed is a slight step up but still light years away from the better books of the series. For one thing, the pace of the story is still too slow. I'm three quarters of the way through the book and we are still in the same day. For another, I've decided that as much as I loved Richmond Kay, I can't stand Boston Kay. For a woman who was always so self-possessed and on the ball, how is the CFC so disorganized? Kay's employees run roughshod over her and she is powerless to stop it? I don't think so. Not for nothing but I hope someone just drops a bomb on her forensic center, I can't imagine a more miserable place to work. With all the shady employees I can't believe they haven't been shut down by now anyways.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert****<br />Also, if Marino's \\"sexual assault\\" on Kay has been so detrimental to the relationship, why on God's green Earth are they still working together?  Just go your separate ways already, I'm tired of the drama. Ditto for Benton. They were a much more intriguing couple when they were involved in an illicit affair. There were logistical flaws in the book as well. Marino is a murder suspect, but the FBI allows Kay to go through the victim's house? Wouldn't that be a gigantic conflict of interest? Also do any of you think Kay would be so unprofessional and inappropriate as to consider having an affair with a subordinate?<br /><br />I almost wonder if Cornwell is farming out the writing to another party. These characters are so out of tune with their original versions.
B001OFJPIS|3.0|Good, solid weird advent/action movie. A bit more fantastical and eerie than the first movie. Special features are good but not exceptional.
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Usually the book is better than the show - not in this case. The story is good but it does not follow the Showtime series exactly. The characters are familiar enough to enjoy but the story varies. Which is ok, it felt like it was an alternate ending to a story I already enjoy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Honestly, the book was FANTASTIC! As a fan of Riordan, I admit this was an on going story with a well written plot. Riordan mixes ancient Greek mythology with present life. I LOVED this book(: (I finished this book in a day and ome night)

B000006UD8|5.0|MACHINE HEAD breathes the rarefied air of being among the best that classic rock has to offer any generation since Elvis.<br /><br />Besides standing the test of time, 98% of Deep Purple fans agree it's the finest album featuring Glover, Gillan, Paice, Lord & Blackmore.  Even Glover, Gillan, Paice, Lord & Blackmore think it's their best.  Considering where MACHINE HEAD was recorded and how little time Purple had to write and record it, it should've sounded awful and been rife with lackluster songwriting and half-baked musical ideas.  The finished product sounded so good the only surprise was the band never again tried recording in a hallway in the Grand Hotel.  In 1972 Glover, Gillan, Paice, Lord & Blackmore were the cutting edge of hard rock musicianship, revered as virtuosos in the Zeppelin weight class.  I'll take the Pepsi challenge and put MACHINE HEAD up against any Led Zep album any day of the week.  I won't say that about any other Deep Purple album except putting the unedited, unfixed MADE IN JAPAN up against the heavily-doctored THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME.<br /><br />The way Purple constructed the songs on this is brilliant.  Hearing the ingenious way Lord and Blackmore comp behind one another while the other solos is a wonderful give-and-take between them AND when they really light it up and play the same lines at the same time they sound like one guy.  Paice's hyper drumming propels the front line on, aided and abetted with Glover's frenetic but clever bass work.  Gillan has to put a face on all this and does so with aplomb by singing often humorous and self-deprecating lyrics, i.e. the character delusional with loneliness asking an empty room \\"where have they hidden my throne.\\"  The vocalist seldom essays his patented shrieking in key here, until the last song 'Space Truckin' when he gives it his best, better than 'Child In Time' I'd hazard to say.<br /><br />The magic of MACHINE HEAD is the way the band performed the material.  Purple's listeners are presented with five superb musicians playing in the most relaxed fashion, almost to the point of nonchalance; the band is a hot rod capable of cruising at 160 mph BUT they idle along at 90.  An example would be comparing Purp's 'Highway Star' to Zep's 'Achilles Last Stand.'  Both are ferocious rock songs: Zeppelin sounds like they're giving it all they've got, like it's the last chance they'll ever get to play; Purple burns just as hard but they've got rocket fuel to spare, like they're just getting warmed up.  They could've ripped MACHINE HEAD's music to shreds but they didn't.  What the listeners are left with is a feeling of understated majesty, a restrained power so casual it belies how smokin' every tune on the album is.<br /><br />The mix is ultra clean, you feel like you're standing in the middle of them in that cold hallway while they're laying down each track.  I was particularly interested in Roger Glover's remixes.  They're good, the highlight being the alternate guitar overdubs on three or four of the seven songs.  But truth be told MACHINE HEAD is such a classic that I still prefer the remastered originals over Glover's remixes.  Purple and Martin Birch chose the best takes forty years ago, but the remixes are a lot of fun to listen to.  The inclusion of 'When A Blind Man Cries\\" recorded at the original sessions is a nice but unnecessary bonus; I can hear why Blackmore didn't like it and why it was only released as a B-side instead of on the album.  It might even have spoiled the classic-ness of one of rock's brightest great moments.esented with five superb musicians playing in the most relaxed fashion, almost to the point of nonchalance; the band is a hot rod capable of cruising at 160 mph BUT they idle along at 90.

B009UQC7NS|5.0|Last season was somewhat disappointing as I grew incredibly tired of the \\"Days Of Our Lives\\" crap between the Sheriff and his whiney wife/lying, ambitious Deputy crap. Glad as all hell to see the Deputy gone for good.<br />The new season of course has our survivor band off the farm and apparently looking to stake claim on a prison. The whiney wife is still a cast member but she has finally seemed to have learned her place as the cheating cow she is. Perhaps now the Sheriffs son might actually survive and is becoming quite the real man that he has to be under the circumstances.<br />I just can't wait until the scriptwriters find a way to write out the mewly wife entirely eliminating her histrionics as well as an original cast members salary. This will help toughen up the series and also help to extend the life of the show as regards budgetary matters.

0525951113|5.0|The best way I can describe Daemon is to say that it's like the \\"Saw\\" movie series with a ton of technology sprinkled in.  A gaming genius dies of cancer, but before dying spent years developing some artificial intelligence that was designed to monitor for news of its creator's death and then unleash itself upon the world in an attempt to bring down civilization.  The book seems written for a narrow demographic.  If you are into technology (or better yet work in information technology), love to play first-person shooters, and enjoy thriller novels (and this describes me) than you will really enjoy Daemon.  Even if you just like a good thriller, you'll like this book, but if you don't work with technology regularly, some of the pieces of the story may make you feel lost.  Suarez is extremely detailed in his descriptions and does a wonderful job painting the scene for the reader...though at times some of the detail seems unnecessary.  A unique premise for a novel and a great read.

B005FMZVLQ|4.0|Let me start my stating the good aspects about this watch:<br /><br />- If you own any of the reserve watches, this will feel much lighter and thinner, which is good for a change<br />- Even with its big face, the watch can still be used for casual dinners, etc, It's got a nice style, very unique.<br />- The strap, the fact that its under side is made of 100% genuine leather.<br />- Keeps time accurately. After a week of owning it, it hasn't skipped.<br />- Very comfortable to wear.<br />- Most of its chronograph works well (not all of it)<br />- Beautiful display window<br />- Plenty of luminousity. The arms and numbers stay lit for a while after dark and are easy to read.<br /><br />Now, a couple of bad things about it:<br /><br />- One of the chronograph's arms, the 1/10 to be exact, is not at true \\"zero\\", it's a bit off to the left.<br />- The Tachymeter is fake. Tachymeters are mainly found, if not only found, on analog watches, and they way they work is, there's a button which changes the \\"seconds\\" arm into Tachymeter mode, which means that the arm will stop moving (counting seconds for time keeping) and move to the 12 (zero) position, when the Tachymeter is then started, the seconds arm will start to rotate with a \\"SWEEPING\\" motion. This watch DOES NOT have that sweeping motion nor does it have a mode button.<br /><br />There are some things you should know about this piece, which I consider, neither bad or good, but more of a neutral aspect, but of course, that's different from person to person. Here they are:<br /><br />- NO INDICATION of where the watch's movement is from. I couldn't find any information about it. Amazon describes the movement as Japanase quartz, but I couldn't find anything on the watch.<br />- As always, Invicta throws in a \\"standard\\" general instructions booklet that applies to their entire line. Specific instructions would be great for those whom may need to factory reset the chronograph(zero reset)and have never done it before.<br />- The strap, notice I didn't write it down as a \\"bad\\" thing, because in reality, it is a nice strap; it will get old and dusty with time, however, I noticed that a damp cloth will wipe off any dirt and/or dust.<br /><br />In conclusion, from an Invicta owner's perspective, honestly speaking, this watch doesn't really match the quality of higer priced Invictas, but for $100 is actually decent. It isn't a bad watch, but it isn't perfect, I don't like \\"fake\\" functions that are shamelessly painted on the piece and mean/do nothing. I hate to think it, but I'm sure I'm right, that this wastch was probably made in China, but at its current price, I guess I shouldn't expect any more. This may not be the best from Invicta, but it is a well made and interesting looking piece.The strap, notice I didn't write it down as a \\"bad\\" thing, because in reality, it is a nice strap; it will get old and dusty with time, however, I noticed that a damp cloth will wipe off any dirt and/or dust.<br /><br />In conclusion, from an Invicta owner's perspective, honestly speaking, this watch doesn't really match the quality of higer priced Invictas, but for $100 is actually decent.

B005LAIHR2|3.0|The actors are all wonderful here and they can all sing, too.  But the story is silly and the direction is lacking, and they cannot rise above it.  I skipped through the scenes with a predictable church group challenging a rock nightclub, and the two main characters' romance is not all that interesting either.  The music is the real star here.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I must say I read this in Spanish first, I couldn't stand the expresions. A book is better to read it in the same language it was written so you won't miss anything in translation. But my opinion didn't change when I read it in English.<br /><br />The Good thing:<br />It's an entertaining story, very erotic with a subject that until recently I heard: the BDSM practices which are the preference of Grey. I don't think they are very shocking in the book as how I imagined. So sex is present in almost every page, he's a good lover and she can keep up. He always aims to please, who wouldn't love that!<br /><br />The Bad thing:<br />It's a story we already know, really there are enough similarities to Twilight, the family type, awkward girl who is beautiful but she believes she's not, sometimes you think she has very low self esteem, the extremely handsome man, perfect and millionaire, her best friend has a crush with her, the guy is so overprotective and I still don't know why he has that fixation, etc, etc, etc. Eventually I almost expected that Christian told her he was a vampire. At least Anastasia wasn't as silly as Bella.<br />Sex is present almost every page and I know I wrote this in the good thing but sometimes is bad becasue is boring, you want to see a real plot.<br /><br />The ugly thing:<br />Definitely reading made ​​me impossibly bearable with repetitive expressions as \\"frowning\\", \\"bit my lip\\" \\"rolled my eyes\\", \\"holly sh*t\\", \\"wow\\", this girl (Anastasia) graduated from Literature and she only speaks like that or do the same gestures over and over again.<br />She speaks a lot with her subconcious and \\"the goddess in me\\", but that was funny, I imagined the little devil and angel doing his job like in the cartoons.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />There's no literature here, the same words all over the book made it so tortuous for me to read it.<br />The story is plain and simple because the author didn't develop a better plot, and I think she could do it, the characters are interesting, It would've been good to know more about them even if it was from Ana's point of view.<br /><br />It is a success because the perfect man is the fantasy of every woman with self-esteem or not, and because women apparently love lost causes. We love to think that men will change for us.<br /><br />I would recomend this book? Sure, because is entertaining, it's a guilty pleasure and I know more than one will take ideas to spice up a relationship.<br /><br />PS: When I read it in Spanish I gave me time to read the other two books. I didn't want to spend more money in something I could barely finish, but I was curious to see the end so a friend borrowed me the books. I must say the second one has a better plot, that was the one I like the most but still, the author didn't deliver.

0345803507|3.0|The first book was a trashy good read but the other two, especially this one, have really lacked overall.  Ana just can't leave this damaged and temperamental guy so she stays with him and deals with fallout from Jack Hyde.  Just stick with the first one.
B009T1TUWK|4.0|The only thing I really like about this show is Sherlock's Energizer Bunny drive. I like the fact that both him and Watson have history to put away and apparently will be working on that together. Otherwise the story line that attempts to support this aspect is pitiful. The police work in the various scenes is just lamentable. Wish they made the cops look smarter so that Sherlock looks better by comparison. Simply doing the police's work for them isn't sufficient for a good show. My curiosity is only peaked about the direction in which the Sherlock/Watson relationship is going to go.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|I've read the two first books in this series and it has been a long while since I have loved a book this much. Very nice story and the historical aspect makes it even more interesting. It's really fascinating how Follet combines real history with intriguing fiction.

B008673ZAQ|3.0|You cannot read this book without reading the first one and you will have to read the next one when it comes out.  They are essentially one really big book.  The similarities of this series to the 50 Shades books is incredible.  And if your purpose is to find out, once and for all, what actually plagues Gideon: you will be let down.  It comes out in 2 pages in the last 10 in the book.  There is actually an antagonist and a conflict in the book (outside of their perpetual fights) but you don't realize this until the whole situation has ended.<br /><br />That being said, if you are looking for a fast read that is entertaining and decently written, I would recommend it.  Now that I have read two of these books, I will definitely read the third when it comes out, but I am definitely not learning anything new in the process.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|As a member of the US Navy, I felt I had to read this book. I did, and was very satisfied. Definitely a great read for anyone interested in special forces culture. Tells a great first-hand account of the death of Osama Bin Laden from a guy who was there.<br /><br />4 stars rather than 5 due to numerous instances where the timeline was confusing, or a \\"mental map\\" of the situations was hard to form.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is an absolutely marvelous and engrossing book. Once I began it, I tore through it until I'd finished it, so invested in the characters and the circus itself did I become. It was recommended to me by a fellow lover of Punchdrunk's SLEEP NO MORE (whom the Author thanks in her acknowledgements) as something I'd identify with and adore, and they were absolutely correct, especially with regards to the obsessive quality of needing to go back to a dreamland that is both real and a complete fiction...These characters will haunt my memory for some time to come.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app on my Kindle Fire. It's very intuitive and works well. I love the layout and the navigation.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|I am a big fan of the original Dark Shadows and Barnabas Collins. While Johnny Depp did his usual wonderful and professional work, the role Barnabas was cast in, did not fill the shoes of Jonathan Frid (original Barnabas). The writer turned a superb Gothic tale into a comedy and it lost the zeal of Barnabas which is central to the story.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|It performs as advertised. The developers often update and improve the app. They respond to user requests. Certainly worth the cost and annual fee.
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|A surprise ending. I can usually have an idea how a mystery might end...not this one not till the last few pages.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|only a few timeline updates come in, then it turns to blue unformatted/no photo/no links-major bugs!<br />facebook used to work just fine so hopefully they get on this soon.
0060873175|3.0|The story was a page turner and the micro view of the chemical and pheromone filled world of insects was fascinating. But I had a hard time with choppy dialog, almost nonexistent character development, and did a lot of overlooking loose ends and incredible leaps in logic and possibility. The book read more like a first draft or sketch for a screenplay that was waiting for an editor to come in and polish the dialog and flow. I've seen Crichton movies and loved them, read a few of his books but this one was different and not recommended.
0374214913|4.0|Any book that successfully combines mysterious bookstores, cryptography, a secret society, Google, typefaces, meaningful numbers ($2,357 is brilliant!), and a museum of \\"Knitting Arts and Embroidery Sciences\\" gets high praise from me. Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is definitely that book. Clay Jannon is an out-of-work art school graduate who finds a job on the night shift in Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore. Mr. Penumbra (a partial shadow, between regions of complete shadow and complete illumination) is interesting in his own right, but his store full of books from the Waybacklist stored on dusty, multi-storied shelves is where curiosity gets the best of Clay and he begins his adventure. He is aided at every turn by his techie acquaintances, but Sloan uses plenty of humor along with the technology so even those of us over thirty get it.<br /><br />This is a well-told, fun story, one that made me think a bit and I even learned a few things. I learned that Aldus Manutius was a real Italian printer and publisher who helped develop italic type, and the use of the comma and semicolon. I learned that Griffo Gerritszoon is fictional. I also learned that Robin Sloan is a very clever writer who can tell a good story. My only regret is that I listened to this as an audiobook (Sloan does have a cameo on the audio version) and didn't read the hard cover with the glow-in-the-dark dust jacket!
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|Haywire is a smart, international thriller that boasts a complicated script with an all-star cast. Like many of Soderbergh's films, you have to pay attention to the details in order to understand the plot. There's a lot of really good fighting sequences, and I think this was the perfect movie to introduce Carano to the world of cinema. The actress definitely delivers in the action category, although she does tend to sound a little flat during some of her dialogue. All-in-all this is a good movie if you're looking for something smart with some excellent and believable fighting scenes.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|What you'll get in this one: the snappy characterizations and plot twists that make Grisham's legal thrillers so irresistible to his loyal fans. I received my book in the wee hours of release day, and stayed up reading the entire novel. It was too good to put down.<br /><br />Grisham wisely keeps readers guessing about how lawyer Malcolm Bannister may pull off a revenge scheme. I was hooked as soon as I grasped the basic plot.<br /><br />But this doesn't mean  The Racketeer is flawless.. It took awhile for me to become fully engaged with the book -- mainly because Grisham took his time revealing crucial details and spent awhile describing prison life. Some of that is interesting and adds depth. But parts of the novel lagged for me.<br /><br />The Racketeer starts off with lawyer Malcolm Bannister describing his basic situation: he has been sent to prison for 10 years based on a sentence \\"handed down by a weak and sanctimonious federal judge in Washington, DC\\". I'm not giving away anything here because that info is revealed on the first page of my edition of this book (Kindle). Bannister has tried every appeal available. His wife, initially supportive, has left him. He misses his son.<br /><br />In short, his life is grim and depressing.  Bannister can't imagine being incarcerated for 10 years, and he is desperate to get out. The reason he is in jail constitutes \\"a long story.\\" but he is convinced he has been convicted of a crime he had \\"no knowledge of committing\\" (he  does, however, admit to naivite' and stupidity which helped lead to his downfall).<br /><br />The rest of the details in the early half of The Racketeer mainly involved Bannister's carefully constructed plan to get out of prison, starting with info he knows about the murder of federal judge Raymond Fawcett. He says he knows who murdered the judge - and why. This is where I started to become intrigued, trying to figure out what if Bannister's plan will succeed- and anticipating the inevitable plot twists along the way. I also wanted to know how his conviction was connected to the murder of the judge. Bannister's exclusive information is what he plans to use as leverage.<br /><br />That's when I became impatient for Grisham to cut to the chase. But because of his writing style, still above par for many legal thrillers, I couldn't put The Racketeer down. Grisham doesn't give everything away at once. Information is revealed chapter by chapter. I wanted to know more. And I'm betting other readers will feel the same. I am not going to reveal any more about The Racketeer because I think there is enough info here to either interest potential readers and help them decide whether the book is of interest or not. I don't want to add spoilers or plot twists.ts along the way. I also wanted to know how his conviction was connected to the murder of the judge.

1932735410|5.0|In addition to this book I bought Andy Crowe book. I am not experience in very large project and Rita,s book covers all the details you need to prepare for the PMP exam, giving tips on keys concepts you need to know. Rita's book digs down deep into understanding the reason behind the processes and describing them in a way that applies to what an experienced project manager will do in the real world. Exercises are given in such a way, that you don't need to memorize but understand. Crowe book are for an experience project manager who has managed large projects. Rita book is overall a much better product to prepare you for the exam.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|I'll start by saying that I DO love the Kindle app, which is why I'm pissed that it no longer works. I run it (or used to) on an Android phone. One day the app simply stopped opening; I get the Kindle welcome screen, then it closes itself out. I've uninstalled and reinstalled it numerous times, from data back ups, the Google app store, and the Amazon app store...nothing works. And like so many pissed off others, I'd recently purchased books.<br /><br />Using the Kindle app was persuading me to finally buy a Kindle device. But if Amazon can't keep a simple app running, there's no way I'm taking a risk on one of their machines.

B0071R43MG|5.0|I had just seen Steve Vai live and was still on a guitar kick so I picked this up. I was blown away by the sound and video quality when I put it in my Blu Ray player with surround sound and cranked it up as loud as I dared. Awesome guitar work, as usual, from Joe and co.
B001F12J48|1.0|I bought this movie in 2008 when it was released, because it's one of my favorite holiday movies and how much fun would it be to watch it in 3D?!<br /><br />First, the 3D is poorly done. Second, the glasses are just cheap cardboard. Third, put those two things together and you get a headache.<br /><br />I attempted to watch it with my nephews and we tried watching in seats, on the floor, various levels, and nothing worked. Nothing looked 3D at all. The glasses didn't want to stay on and were made of cheap cardboard. Even with the glasses on you could still see the red/blue lines on the picture. After awhile we all got a headache and gave up.<br /><br />I'm sorry I ever spent the money on the 3D version. Looking forward to upgrading to Blu-Ray, but I think I'll pass on the 3D version there too.<br /><br />Note: This review only refers to \\"The Polar Express Presented in 3-D\\" (DVD) This is NOT a review for the Blu Ray version.
B007THA4FI|3.0|It had a lot of people in the story and they all had knick-names and sometimes it was hard to follow.also the accent was hard to read at times.
B001H55MBY|5.0|Bought this for my gf for her birthday and it is a very large, beautiful book. Hard cover. The illustrations are gorgeous. Definitely worth buying if you are a Dark Crystal fan or just a lover of all things fantasy. Brian Froud is phenomenal.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|When it says complete, it really means it.  There were many things contained in this book that were new to me, along with the expected classics.  There's no need to evalutate Mr. Dickens as a writer, but I will say that to have this available for .99 is truly a testament to the positive impact of technology on our society.

0553582461|5.0|Forewarning: I'm a spoiler purist, and so try to avoid spoilers as much as possible in my reviews, including basic information about both plot and characters. As a result, my reviews are somewhat vague, but I try my best to keep things spoiler-free.<br /><br />At the end of `Golden Fool' I was worried about the direction of the story. It seemed that certain plot threads of the story up until that point were going to conflict badly, the likely result being that some of them were going to be sacrificed in pursuit of the others. And this is more or less what happened. Hobb still tells an outstanding tale - much of this book is fantastic - but the story she actually tells comes with a cost.<br /><br />In this book, there's a growing difference between the individual threads of Fitz's life and the driving forces of the plot. It made me wonder how on earth everything that had been built up to that point would be solved, particularly in Fitz's personal life. The answer is that almost all the things I worried about were told with too little depth or were too rushed, particularly in comparison to the rest of the story.<br /><br />There simply isn't much room in this book for them, and when their time for attention comes they're delivered half-baked. It pains me to say it, but these character relationships were really important to me, and I didn't find them that believable. As another reviewer wrote, it's like Hobb set aside the last five books of character development at times. Characters are manipulated into position to make what happens believable, but that undermines itself because it seems so contrived. It's not even that they don't, or can't, make sense - they can, but they don't have anywhere near enough depth to be believable.<br /><br />Other than that big stumble, Hobb excels with her characterisation again. I don't need to say much on this, other than what I've said in my last eight reviews of her books; the characters deliver.<br /><br />The plot, apart from its problematic elements in twisting the individual plot threads, is also very good. Hobb's basic narrative style kicks back in here, with the characters quests driving where they go and what they do, but with the larger focus being on the character relationships as they go about doing what they have to do.<br /><br />There are still downsides to that. There are underlying influences which are finally revealed, and the way in which that happens isn't very believable. It's abrupt, and seems more like it was tacked into the story rather than being built up to; despite past hints, they didn't build enough depth. I also didn't find the character motivations here very compelling at all.<br /><br />I can't really think of much else to say, other than I found this book very engaging. Hobb's writing style lends itself to slowly building interest, and, for me, that came to fruition here. The character arcs were all very well executed, and most of them hit me hard. It's rare that I cry when I finish a series simply because I won't get to read any more of it, that there's no more of the characters lives to look into, but that's the case here. And that's what Hobb is essentially doing here: inviting us into her characters lives.<br /><br />Hobb's ending here, as her endings typically have been, isn't delivered particularly well. Again, this is more a matter of depth to the story than anything else. While the ending is much bigger and more comprehensive than some of Hobb's other endings, it still feels insufficient to me. There's still a rushed quality to how many of the individual relationships and plotlines are tied up. There's some degree of resolution, and a knowledge that the characters lives are going on, but this is delivered far too simplistically, contrasting with the depth and complexity in the rest of Hobb's story.<br /><br />In the end, I enjoyed this book, and series, very much. I'm content with it. But it also has its fair share of rather glaring faults.<br />4.5/5

1451627297|3.0|I'm going to go against the grain here and say this was a \\"good\\" book that I read from cover to cover fairly quickly, but not without my irritations. The time travel piece was very interesting and made for a great story.  The other story line sometimes bugged me to no end and I felt like I was reading some ho-hum run of the mill love story with non-stop sex and crazy psycho ex-husband and all.  I also couldn't get over some of the odd choices for details, like the young librarian from Savannah in the early 1960's wearing jeans.  But most disappointing of all was that Stephen King believes that Oswald was the lone gun man. Don't we all know about the conspiracy by now??<br /><br />Still a good book and worth the read.

0062060562|5.0|From the first chapter to the last, this book had me hook,line and sinker. I could not put it down. I was interested in the characters, their roles and of course the mysterious plot. This is a quick read that makes you think about your own well being, the people who surround you, who you trust and who would take care of you if something tragic happened. The writer takes you inside every character's mind for this whirlwind affair of events that unravel until you know the truth.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I agree with the author that this is a story that needed to be told.  Considering the fact of our with drawls from Iraq and Afghanistan, these are the \\"folks\\" who will be carrying a greater and greater load in those areas and other \\"hot spots\\" around the world.  They avoid notoriety, but should be better known in general.  I think they are indeed very special as this book points out clearly.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|I didn't love this book, but I didn't hate it either.  I just didn't fall in love with like so many others.  I did read the entire story and found it interesting enough to finish.  I just didn't seem to warrant all the hype from my standpoint.  Maybe I just couldn't get into the narration by Death or maybe I just missed the true component of this time in history as told through non-fiction books.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Really enjoyed the historical account of the war, from the outbreak till the end.<br />I enjoyed the different perspectives of the war from both an individuals and global view.

B0027MJU00|3.0|This is the second Gillian Flynn book I read (after 'Gone Girl'). Both are untypical criminal books with an attractive, vivid plot which was quite difficult for me to foresee. In 'Dark Places', I found a famous-murder-tracking society somewhat unconvencing, but I think it was needed to push Libby Day to enquiry abount her dreadful past (and get in touch with her brother). Otherwise the characters were credible.<br /><br />Genarally, a very good piece of criminal fiction worth to be recommended.
B000069KGM|5.0|Have a listen to arguably the greatest rock musicians in their prime. Terry Kath demostrates why many musicians in the know classify him as the greatest guitar player of all time. His ability to sing like Ray Charles and play like Jimi Hendrix are showcased on this album. Peter Cetera bass playing is like \\"Motown meets the Beatles\\"  This album is simply a \\"Master Piece\\" Give it a listen, it is inspirational

B0091REZMW|4.0|Best missing object game that I've seen as a FAOTD. The graphics are as good and detailed as any out there. The addition of the &quot;Clue&quot; boardgame-style mansion map is a nice touch. The numerous objectives and leveling up allow for rewards even when searching a room over and over again. Unfortunately the are a limited number of the hidden objects themselves,  so the actual searching can get a bit predictable after visiting the same room a bunch of times. Overall though, very good.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I love living vicariously through the character, Jack Reacher.

This is a book to read and reread just for the thrill of it.<br />Grandpadoc
1439152802|5.0|If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. I have anticipated the release of Kate Morton's latest book for what seems like forever. I was not disappointed. Until now, The Forgotten Garden was my favorite-but no longer.  I won't give a synopsis since others already have. I'll just say that I loved every minute I spent reading this novel and haven't stopped thinking about the characters all day.  I don't usually read a book a second time, but I feel certain I will do it this time. My only regret is that I finished it too fast-but I read late into the night because I just couldn't stop. I had read in another review that there was a surprise ending and thought I'd figured it out-but I was wrong and didn't see it coming!  Kate Morton is in a class all by herself.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|Like all of the Tinkerbell movies made since 2008 they have continued on with the small, yet large adventures that teach important lessons often times about friendship. The animation used is top notch and lives up to the Disney standard. What I have always liked about these movies is the environment that it takes place in. We get to see all of the little structures built cleverly out of ordinary materials that humans such as ourselves would never dream of using in such a way. The landscapes are extremely vibrant and really look alive.<br /><br />I am a 22 year old animation student and even though this is targeted at young girls it still is a testament of the quality that comes out of Disney studios. They have the right creative team behind these productions and I hope to see more in the future.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|I haven't even put a second battery in this battery grip yet, but I still love it.  In short, it makes portrait (vertical) shooting so much easier.  My main gripe with it is that the vertical shutter button is FAR too sensitive, and I end up taking a lot of accidental shots when I am just trying to focus or shift the camera.  It's pretty annoying.  Why Canon didn't make the shutter button the same as the camera's main one is baffling.  Besides that, I like the added weight, and the vertical shooting is so much easier and more comfortable.  I also find that my sholder doesn't strain as much, and it is much easier to find a straight vertical while using the grip than without it.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Prior to these, I had a Turtle Beach X12 wired gaming headset. I could speak volumes about what a piece of crap that was but, I'll spare you.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, these are a vast improvement. Wireless connectivity is reliable and strong. The software pack included is great but does have some silly features (alien, robot, etc. voice morphing.) Built-in advanced frequency equalizer, adjustable sidetone, microphone sensitivity, focus adjustment. Handy volume controls on the left-hand earpiece along with a mute button, (3) \\"G keys\\" for functionality of either media controls (next, previous, pause/play) or the Logitech software. Media controls are limited to either iTunes or Windows Media Player so that is a little discourteous, it would be nice if the user could manually select a specific program to control. The Dolby Surround Sound does create a noticeable difference in the listening experience (game sounds, media sounds, and voice communication can all be heard from separate channels without being played on top of one another). Battery life is fantastic! The G930 \\"control panel\\" has a remaining battery meter and estimated remaining battery life, says \\"about 10 hours\\" on a full charge.<br /><br />If I had one drawback to mention, it would be the connecting and disconnecting of the audio playback device. By simply turning the headset off, it does not stop sound from being forwarded to the headphones. You must manually remove the USB receiver to resume listening from any connected speakers. A little bit annoying, but it IS made easier by the included desktop USB hub (which also serves as the charging station).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />JChap1590

B008NABUU8|4.0|This app missed out on some great opportunities to educate the user. For instance, when unlocking the cables, it mentioned tensile and compressive loads. Rather than assuming that the user knows what that means (I know I didn't, I had to guess), the game could have explained it a little bit more and the user would have walked away having learned something. Otherwise, they just have to guess at what it means and hope their designs magically work at some point.<br /><br />Once I figured out what they were talking about, I suppose you could say it should have been somewhat obvious. Cables are good for holding stuff up, but you wouldn't want to make a beam underneath the bridge out of them. Still, sounded like the developer was trying to sound smart without helping the user at all, so minus one star for that.<br /><br />As for how the game operates, it works just fine on my Toshiba Thrive (running Android 3.2, if that helps).<br /><br />The 3D aspect of this game is a nice change, compared to other apps with the same concept. But I still wish one of them would actually try to teach/explain to the user good design principles so that we don't have to just keep guessing at what might possible be a good design according to your specific game engine. You clearly have ideas in mind for what makes a good bridge, would it be so wrong to give us a hint? Obviously, any such explanatory mode (even just hints and tips) should be optional or easily skippable for the people who actually know what they're doing already.
1612680011|5.0|Im am not one for reading unless the topic really interests me. I found this book to be amazing. I first heard of it in 2009 and it took me this long to finally buy it and read it after attending a Robert Kiyosaki seminar. I love it. I bought another copy for my 17 year old daughter who just started college this year. I hope she reads it and gets something from it as I did.<br /><br />While reading this book, I realized I am on the right path. I have had a life of negativity whether it be from me or from others. In 2009 I finally started doing something about it. This books mentions many things you need to do to change and take control of your life and wealth. Unbeknown to me, I had slowly been doing this the correct way. It has been hard to reach where I am now and decided I need education to continue moving forward.<br /><br />This book is a GREAT place to start. I have a stack of 8 more books still to read. Some by Kiyosaki and some by other investors. Knowledge is definitely the key.<br /><br />GREAT BOOK.

0515141429|4.0|Great Read.  Well written.  This novel is the first in a series and sets the groundwork<br />for an action hero who wanders the country.  Only complaint is the plot hinges<br />heavily on an implausible coincidence. But, having said that, still  an enjoyable read.

B008NABUU8|5.0|Lots of fun! Load times are a little slow, but its worth it. Challenging, good graphics, good controld on a tablet.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It is very different than Harry Potter (as is to be expected), but I thought the characters were deep and interesting. They are often small-minded and petty, but their lives are woven together in a fascinating and compelling way. The end is a little heartbreaking but certainly memorable.
B000002KKC|5.0|What a classic. The Buckingham penned tracks are incredible, you can hear the influence they've had on so many alternative artists operating right now - Modest Mouse (`What Makes You Think You're the One'), Ryan Adams (`Save Me a Place'), Grandaddy (`That's All for Everyone'), Wilco (`Not That Funny'), R.E.M (`I Know I'm Not Wrong') and basically any band fond of dropping truly odd curveballs (`Tusk', `Ledge') should tip their hat in this direction. A man creatively on fire at this point - his vocals are so infectious and alive he sounds positively possessed in places!<br /><br />The truly astounding thing is that if you stripped away all of these songs you'd still have an incredibly strong album of more typical Mac material left behind. `Storms', `Over and Over', `Sisters of the Moon' and particularly `Sara' and `Beautiful Child' are some of the best ballads in their discography, while `Think About Me' is a decent pop rock number.<br /><br />I've only recently discovered `Tusk' and until now I had no idea Fleetwood Mac had produced a double album's worth of brilliantly off the wall music way back in 1979 - a real eye opener.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo is a family film that everyone should see at least once!The plot is one of heroism, bravery, love, and loyalty. The graphics were captivating and the music was truly moving. I am thoroughly satisied with my purchase and look to buy from this seller again in the near future.
1423140605|3.0|\\"The Mark Of Athena\\" is not what I was expecting, in some ways I love what Riordan did with the story and in other ways not so much. This third installment of The Heroes Of Olympus series seemed a little slow to me, the characters that our heroes encounter on their way didn't really captivate me like they did in the first two books and even in the five books of the Percy Jackson series.<br /><br />Percy and Jason were portrayed as the leaders of the group, only naturally since the two of them are sons of the two most powerful gods although the book is more about Annabeth and her ultimate quest to follow the Mark Of Athena, and she is one brilliant hero. I was never a huge fan of Annabeth but after this book and how she completes her quest she is quickly climbing the list!<br /><br /> I would have to say that my favorite character in this book and maybe even series is Leo Valdez the son of Hephestus the god of the forge (what an intro!) only because I can relate to him and his struggles with fitting in with a certain group and using humor, sarcasm and wits to win arguments and fights.<br /><br /> Frank is such a big teddy bear that I forgot that he was a son of the war god Ares, and it is a nice change of pace whereas Clarisse in the Percy Jackson series is so violent and can't wait for a fight Frank is just the opposite and understands that being the biggest and the baddest isn't all it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />Hazel and Piper are both done up well too and both have chances to save the day, Hazel with her valuable metals and underground skills and Piper with her charmspeak use them well and wisely which is good.<br /><br />To sum it up I liked this book, I want to love this book but I just can't.<br />Riordan leaves it with such a cliffhanger that I'm not sure I can wait another year for it to come out. hopefully it is better than this one, although this one is honestly worth reading. as a 22 year old fantasy fan you can imagine that my taste in books is probably a bit more complex than this series which was written at a middle school level and is a very easy read but I think it is a fun read and a good break from the dark fantasy books that I'm used to reading.<br /><br />if you are a fan of Greek/Roman mythology and want a lighthearted easy read then this book is for you just make sure you read the first 2 before you do.
B0093OGBL6|2.0|I completely agree with Sanemjfan.<br />Allthough this is a very positive book about Michael Jackson, and I was really looking forward to reading this, I have to say that I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of research the author did.<br /><br />Yes, the little tidbits MJ's bodyguards shared with her are a fun read and great to know for a Michael Jackson fan but overall I didn't learn anything new about the man.<br /><br />What really bothered me were the different tabloids, fan boards, blogs and other books she quoted and presented as facts (Honestly, I read `according to biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli' one too many times and when did TMZ become a legit source?).<br />As someone who has researched the 1993 case, the 2005 trial, the Murray trial and everyting else about MJ's life, a lot of information in this book is not quite accurate. She comes closes though, but lots of time she drops the ball and missed a great opportunity to document the mere facts.<br /><br />For instance she writes about the AEG contract but instead of quoting from the contract itself, she chooses to quote a fan's opinion on a forum. That's not a fact and someone else's opinion doesn't belong in her book.<br /><br />Same goes for Murray and her information about who hired him. If the author had followed the Murray trial, she knew the real answer to that but again she decides to quote from a forum post which I can only believe was written before the information during the trial became available.<br /><br />Her research on the 2005 trial is very poor to say the least. Again, she could have used the trial transcripts, which are available for everyone. But again she quotes from fan sites and forums.<br /><br />Then there are the `little' mistakes she makes like writing Marlon Brando played a character in the Smooth Criminal short film.<br /><br />I feel this book could have been half its size seeing that the author repeats herself a lot. Example: every time Diana Ross is mentioned, it is followed by how much MJ respected and loved her from an early age. Don't get me wrong, it is worth mentioning to get the full story but it's not necessary to repeat it throughout the whole book. Her writing style is at times too elaborate and not to the point, so sometimes she looses me with all her background information and her views of the situation.<br /><br />A good read, but there are other books about MJ available that are an awesome read. If you want to learn about the man, go find one of these.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I had to order this from the states (thanfully Region Free) due to the unholy debacle that was the avengers release in the UK. It took its time to arrive, but the prduct was well worth the wait. All the special features were present & correct(unlike the UK release), the Coulson death scene was uncut (unlike the UK release) & the blu ray picture was of reference quality, filling the screen of my 50 inch plasma with its Aspect Ratio of 1.78:1 (no widescreen black bars!).<br />All in all. Awesome
B0041D843M|5.0|I am approximately 3/4 of the way through this book and I have just been amazed with what I have learned.  This book contains zero propaganda, just facts from years of comprehensive research.  Before starting this book I was starting a vegetarian lifestyle.  I had cut out meat but not eggs and cheese.  After reading the first few chapters of this book, I decided without a doubt to pursue a whole foods plant based diet.  It has been about 3 weeks now, and while it has been a little challenging (avoiding dairy products in particular), I am really enjoying it.  I have since recommended this book to my husband, parents, and in-laws.  In good conscious I just could not keep this info to myself.  I also recommend watching the film Forks over Knives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this show is very well done and entertaining. The costumes are beautiful and the characters are complex. I can't wait for season 3!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|'Quiet' is a book for everyone who has an opposite 'trovert' in their personal or work life.  As an introvert, the explanation about the current research in the introvert personality explained so many attitudes and situations within my life.  The case studies were illuminating and good examples of how introverts and extroverts can compromise to achieve better results.  I have lent my copy to friends and have purchased copies for family.  It is an easy read and as hard to put down as many thrillers.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I always enjoy Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels and this was no exception. It was a little faster paced than some and I liked the characters. If you enjoy stories of super heroes (almost)with unbelievable insight, all thought processes carefully detailed by the author and super strength which have seen him overpower seemingly insurmountable odds, then this book will not disappoint.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded the Kindle Reader app for my mobile phone and it works without issue.  I have a Casio G'z One, Android operating system.

I will download other books in the future so that I will have something to read when I travel.  I gave this app 5 stars because so far, I am 100% happy.

0312330537|5.0|Shantaram, written by Gregory David Roberts, is a novel that I enthusiastically recommend. Roberts is a self-proclaimed heroin addict, bank robber, escaped prisoner, and member of the Indian organized crime syndicate, whose extraordinary life experiences are weaved into a powerful narrative. As a person whose life has become dominated by the digital rush of emails, texts, and social media, I'm increasingly drawn to the opposite extreme: a good book. I found an extraordinary one in Shantaram.<br /><br />Shantaram's plot blends a vivid narrative with unforgettable characters, remarkable adventures, and superb evocations of Indian life. It's a spell-binding novel which draws its inspiration from factual events in the life of the author. Although Roberts acknowledges that the book is a work of fiction, the fantastic writing and original plot create an authentic quality which blurs the line between fiction and reality.<br /><br />Like most fantastic books, it does not achieve perfection. Roberts makes a conspicuous attempt to convince the reader that he is a `good guy', whereas, he is anything but. He started out as a heroin addict, anarchist, and self-professed revolutionary. Next, he was sentenced to 19 years in prison for robbery in his native country, Australia. He escaped prison and fled to India, where he joined the Indian mafia. During this stage of his life, he became an expert in black market currency crime, passport forgery, counterfeiting, and smuggling, and he later participated in a gun-running operation that spanned several continents. Fortunately, Roberts is also a very gifted story teller, and in Shantaram, he weaves these life experiences into an excellent tale of high adventure infused with profound insights.<br /><br />I was recommended this book by an Indian colleague during my first visit to India. He insisted that the India that this book depicts is one in which I was sure to be interested. And he was right! As the economic center of the world increasingly shifts to Asia, a deep understanding of foreign cultures and customs is becoming more valuable each year. By way of the author's detailed descriptions of the Indian people and life in the densely crowded nation, this book absolutely helped me improve my understanding of this fascinating nation.<br /><br />The book has a compelling beginning, and the reader is quickly fascinated by the protagonist, Lin, who, after escaping from prison in Australia, arrives in Mumbai on a fake passport. Here, he meets the endearing Prabaker, a native of the slums, who becomes his eternally joyful guide to the city. Due to a series of unfortunate events, Lin is forced to live in these Mumbai slums, where he sets up a free health clinic as a way to contribute to the community. It is during his visit to Prabaker's native village of Sunder that Lin is given the titular Marathi name, Shantaram, or \\"Man of Peace\\". These aforementioned sections of the book are some of the most impressive as they best showcase the spirit of India and the incredible personality of its people. The author describes many incredible characters interspersed with the dirt, squalor, disease, fire, floods, and extreme poverty. The reader becomes quite attached to these characters as they are narrated with genuine affection, passion, and love. Just as the protagonist clearly falls in love with India, he also falls for Karla, a mysterious and beautiful Swiss-American woman whom he pursues throughout the book. I particularly enjoyed this first half of the novel as it tells an amazing story of a normal man living an unusual life under extraordinary circumstances. In the second half of the book, Lin travels to Africa on trips commissioned by the Indian mafia, and later travels to Afghanistan where he smuggles weapons for Mujahideen freedom fighters. Although the story and the characters in this section are not as endearing, it was just as entertaining, if a bit more gruesome.<br /><br />Roberts includes personal and profound insights throughout the story. There are many interesting discussions about human existence and the meaning of life. Occasionally, the author introduces self-indulgent philosophical musings, and I believe that these digressions could have been reduced through more concise editing. It is no surprise then that the book comes in at more than 900 pages.<br /><br />While this book does have a few shortcomings, Roberts does an amazing job of chronicling enlightenment, compassion, and redemption, and at times this book can be laugh-out-loud funny. Overall, I love this book and recommend it to any lovers of literature. The writing is often superb, the plots are intriguing, the characters have immense depth, and the tenderness with which the author describes his evolving relationship with the people is stunning. This book is a must-read for anybody who loves enticing stories, philosophical journeys and literary imagery. Likewise, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in better understanding the amazing culture of India.d profound insights throughout the story.

B002UBRFDC|4.0|This is one of the all time great reads especially if you have every visited Japan.  The book accurately captures the complexity of the Japanese psyche and gives an excellent insight into the great honour that is inheirant to the Japanese.  I first read this book 30 years ago and it is still a wonderful book.  I have been fortunate to visit the National monument that is the grave of Anjin-san and his Japanese wife just outside Yokosuka in the prefecture that he governed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I must say I love this app! The way this app ties in a real voice reading of the chapters of the Bible are just plain fantastic! It make daily reading so much better. I love having it read the Chapter while I follow along. And when it is done it automatically brings the next chapter and turns the page so you don't miss a beat.<br />The only thing that could be improved is to download the voice reading so you could continue off line, but I understand that not all devices have enough storage for doing that.<br />This app is just perfect for me.<br />Well done is all I can say and I strongly recommend it to anyone.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|After finishing the first Wool book I was eager to dive into further storyline and felt more than ready to take on the other four books in this presentation. My overall impression of this series after finishing book 5 is that it is absolutely fantastic. I embraced the world and the characters, cared about them, was fascinated by what they went through and excited to learn more at every turn. The characters rang true including the strong female leads. I would strongly recommend this series to anyone who can appreciate a good dystopian story. Despite its length this is an easy read with a nice clean writing style that corresponds beautifully with the drabness of its world.<br /><br />In all honesty, I felt like there was a bit of filler in the middle of the first book though overall it was great. I connected least with the second book, the third book was pretty good, and the fourth and fifth were phenomenal. I think edited down a little this book would make an epic trilogy. That said, I am still strongly pro-Wool. I can't wait for subsequent books in this series.<br /><br />There is a Q&A with the writer in the kindle version shortly before the epilogue, is funny and likable. Don't miss that.

Well for a metalhead like my self, box sets like this are a Godsend! Not only do you feel you've purchased a more personalised product but it gives you access to more of what you want, the music. This Box set features Two CD's and one DVD with the original album, a second disc with acoustic, live and cover songs (Including Pantera's A New Level \m/), a documentary DVD and some neat little bits of memorabillia... It's a must have for any Knucklehead and/or metalhead :)

I am so pleased this is not the case and look forward to her next work...for us adults. Very entertaining, couldn't put it down. Well worth the wait. I did have my doubts...but she proved them wrong. Very seldom does this happen for an author who wrote a children's book. I think there have been two: Professor JRR TOLKIEN and his best friend CS LEWIS. This book has earned it's place on the shelf with their ADULT works. Cheers Jo!!

But before that, make a last mission with the old Batman, and the aging Nightwing. That Nightwing in the story of the Redhood was totally WRONG\\"

B004QL7K6G|2.0|Linda (Jennifer Aniston) and George (Paul Rudd) have it all--great jobs, a wonderful marriage and a shiny new microloft in the heart of New York City in which to toast their success. Well, that is until George loses his job and Linda's documentary is passed up on by HBO. So now what's a hip, happening couple to do? Taken in by George's douchey brother, they struggle to find their place in the world. After a refreshing overnight stay at Elysium, the couple decides to make their home more permanently at the rural commune, only to find the free-spirited life isn't quite what it seems.<br /><br />You know those movies where the trailer looks absolutely hilarious but then when you watch it you realize that all the funny parts were already in the trailer and you've essentially wasted your time? Yeeeeah. This is one of those movies. Don't get me wrong--I'm not saying Wanderlust wasn't funny, because it certainly did have its moments, but those parts are very far and very few between. Overall, for the type of movie it was, it was conventional and generic. Again, this is one of those times where high expectations led to severe disappointment. Wain and Rudd's previous collaborations (Wet Hot American Summer and Role Models) were total winners. I mean, the concept--taking a modern, hip couple and throwing them into a hippie-style commune--is comedy gold. So then where did it all go wrong?<br /><br />Let's start with the casting. Aniston isn't someone you'd expect to see in a raunchy comedy and I suppose since her stint in Horrible Bosses, she's trying hard to break away from her rom-com typecasting. But I have to say, she just looked like a fish out of water. It just wasn't a role that suited her. Rudd, on the other hand, was right at home with his composed-man-meets-crazy-antics act. He practically invented and perfected the dry wit and sarcastic humour bit and he's about the movie's only saving grace because of it. I feel like everything else was just too forced or over the top to be funny. Wanderlust was a let-down and in no way lives up to Wain's previous credits. Yes, some of the characters are quirky but they grow to be too awkward and unbelievable for my liking. The plot was a mash-up of dull hippy clich&eacute;s and it got old very quickly. I honestly had a better time watching the trailer than I did the feature-length film, which is saying something.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Wanderlust is one of those movies that is doomed to lay in the \\"failed-to-meet-expectations graveyard.\\" It's a conventional film that's raunchy for the sake of being raunchy and far from memorable, though it does generate a few laughs. I'd say, if you want to see it, it's worth a rental at best.<br /><br />Rating: ★★top to be funny. Wanderlust was a let-down and in no way lives up to Wain's previous credits.

B009AJDDQU|1.0|Worst movie I have seen in a long time. The director tried to bring home points that have been made time and time again, thinking them to be groundbreaking, mindblowing views. They are not. The idea that we came from a different planet has been around for a very long time. Our DNA being shot across the universe is nothing new. The anti-climatic ending, along with the mundane story telling throughout made me give this movie 1 star. I'd give it a -5 if I were allowed. I wasted 15 bucks on this piece of crap and I hope no one else has to waste their money thinking they are about to watch a good movie. The characters lacked anything that would grant them the viewer's heart or compassion. The story had many loopholes and the fact that the aliens immediately killed us was like \\"COME ONNN!\\"
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book. Read it in less than a week. I can't wait for the next one. Keeps you hooked from beginning to end.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The expendables was a love song to action movies of the 80's and 90's and this movie continues the greatness. With Jean Claude van Damme playing the villain almost like he was born to do it, and Chuck Norris (legendary badass) making appearances, the awesomeness has increased by around 75%. So many in jokes for fans of these movies, and even if you are not a fan, you can still appreciate the film in its own right (the references to Chuck Norris facts is a laugh out loud moment).<br /><br />But like with the first movie, this film goes deeper and has substance to go with the flashiness. Beyond all the explosions and mayhem, there is a real story that involves the audience. With all of these factors, you can't go wrong with this film!
B007THA4FI|5.0|Great story. The first third is a little slow but then the characters hook you. This story is so different from Harry Potter. It is not a feel good book but a commentary of judgemental people.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just some good, mindless, time-wasting fun! Definitely will keep you from being bored. For free? You will not regret this.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|If she is still country, you can barely tell. I'd only pass about 3 songs as country and it's definately not what I expected. It's still a great cd though. I'm a little disappointed, but then again, I ad SUPER high expectations.
034580404X|1.0|I did not write the article below.  However, I started to read the \\"50 Shades\\" book on my kindle (because I love to read and was excited about a new good book series) but I returned it to Amazon after only reading a few chapters. I found it offensive. And after reading this article I know why. It is promoting abuse. For sure. So I am sharing this article in the hopes that it will prove insightful to others as well:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The story of convicted child rapist Jerry Sandusky is well known.  So too is the 50 Shades of Grey phenomena, a book that has become so popular among women that some are referring to it as \\"Mommy Porn\\" for the masses.  That description is actually a lot more disturbing than a lot of folks are currently realizing.<br /><br />Yes, 50 Shades is pornography. Like most pornography, the storyline is weak, the characters one-dimensional, while the sex itself graphic, detailed, but formulaic.  The underlying theme to 50 Shades is something far more sinister and appalling though than your mere run-of-the-mill porn.  It is pedophilia.  It is child porn.  Kiddie porn.<br /><br />Now I know after saying that, many female fans of 50 Shades, many of them mothers, will naturally put up a defense against that kind of description.  These women, being mothers, are naturally wired to protect kids.  People like Jerry Sandusky are viewed with hatred, revulsion, and disgust.  Rightfully so.  What mother would want to condone anything having to do with the sexual abuse of children?  Of innocents?<br /><br />But that is exactly what 50 Shades of Grey is really about.  It is a story of a girl being sexually molested, over and over again, by a male figure with all the power, all the control.  It is the classic abuse scenario.  And mothers are, in some cases, quite literally getting off on it, which takes the disgust of this phenomena to a whole other frightening level.<br /><br />So having put that out there, and I hope I haven't lost any of you just yet.  I owe you an explanation after having made that kind of accusation about a book some of you may be reading right now.  I'll start with a bit of background first.<br /><br />My professional experience centers around nearly 20 years with Child Protective Services.  Over that time, I've seen situations that do, literally, keep me up at night.  The amount of abuse that is going on in our society, that sexualization of our kids...well basically, what you hear about, what is reported in the news, that is only a small sample of just how large of a problem and the disgusting acts that are going on every day.  Kids are being raped.  Kids are being abused.  Every single day.  Over and over and over again.<br /><br />I didn't seek out 50 Shades of Grey.  It was brought to my attention by a longtime friend who is also a clinical psychologist at a university.  She's a bit older than me.  She grew up in the counter culture era and did her fair share of experimentation of all kinds.  So she's hardly a prude.  What she today though is a mother and grandmother.  And she's smart.  One of the things that fascinates her is this age of cultural phenomena.  How due to technology things now spread so quickly throughout society and become the next big thing at an increasingly rapid pace.  She says sometimes this phenomena is pretty much harmless, and other times it can be very damaging to kids and or adults who begin to emulate something out of a need to belong to the \\"next big thing\\".<br /><br />Her reaction to 50 Shades of Grey though was much more aggressively negative than anything I could recall her talking about before.  It came up because I mentioned it to her offhand.  I had seen a couple mentions of it on the news and knowing her interest in cultural trends, asked her about it.  She stopped talking, looked right at me, and said the book was about pedophilia.  And it was her who then connected it to the Sandusky tragedy where so many young boys had been sexually abused. Sandusky committed his acts of crime under the cover of actually helping youth.  That is how he gained access.  My friend said 50 Shades was basically the same exact thing.  Its cover was a story of a young woman engaging is a very graphic sexual relationship with a somewhat older man.<br /><br />The problem for her, and it was a BIG PROBLEM, was that the narrator in the story, was in fact, an underage girl.  My friend indicated, based on the use of language in the narration, that this girl was likely no more than 12 or 13 years of age.  I made mention that the girl in the story was actually getting ready to graduate college.  My friend, a woman with years of experience as a clinical psychologist, whose expertise I had personally witnessed a number of times over the years, shook her head and told me that she would not be able to convince me by simply talking about it.  She said I should read the book myself, but do so with the eyes of somebody whose job it had been for many years to try and protect children.  As someone who has seen over and over the signs of abuse, and the damages of abuse.  Because there are always warning signs.  I know that.  How many times have I heard people horrified in saying \\"I can't believe I didn't see that\\"  \\"How couldn't I have known?\\"  Or even worse, \\"I knew something wasn't right but I didn't want to believe they were capable of doing something like that.\\"<br /><br />I'll try and summarize my friend's words at this point as best I can.<br /><br />\\"Sexual predators are cons.  They almost always have a cover.  It's that cover which allows them access.  50 Shades of Grey is a con.  It now has access to millions of readers.  It is a story about abuse from beginning to end.  And it's not just the abuse of a man and a woman - it's the abuse of a man and a girl.<br /><br />When you read it, look for the signs.  They are all there.<br /><br />The female character has no sexual experience.  None.  She is given the age of 21, but that age is itself acover.  Her true emotional age is much-much younger.  She has never even masturbated.  She has never even experienced an orgasm.  That alone is one of the greatest attractions to the pedophile.  That is the psychology of that kind of act.  You get off on taking purity.<br /><br />But move from the fact the girl has no sexual experience whatsoever.  Now pay attention to her narrative dialogue.  Really listen to how she talks.  Again, she's not talking like a young woman, she's talking like a girl.  She talks about cartwheels, and skipping, over and over again it is the language and the imagery of a girl.<br /><br />After that this girl has her innocence taken from her.  The abuser, the older man, makes her think its her choice.  Again, you and I both know that is one of the primary tools of the pedophile.  They create an environment where the child feels it's their idea.  It's what they want. But what happens after that innocence is taken away?  Then the abuser becomes more openly abusive. Controlling.  In this story he tells the little girl how to speak.  What to wear.  What to eat.  He is Daddy and she is daughter.  When you read it read it like a mother who is also a woman who is experienced with the real life tragedy of abuse.<br /><br />And there is many more themes about that abuse in this book.  There is spanking and the use of Baby oil.  Why baby oil?  Think about it.  The girl wears pigtails.  She complains that he is treating her like a child.  He says she acts like a child.  There is even a scene where the abuser creates a situation to take her innocence from her again.  He rips out her tampon and engages in forceful sex yet again.  Her hymen is ripped, and the bloody remnants of it are again symbolized in an act of pedophile rape.\\"<br /><br />She went on to say there are women now defending the book, and she understands that, but it concerns her.  A great deal, because she is absolutely convinced the book is purposely advocating the raping of a child andattempting to normalize that atrocity.<br /><br />So, I left that conversation thinking maybe my friend was exaggerating.  I had a hard time believing something so popular could actually have such a sinister and revolting theme, and while I respected her expertise and experience, thought this time she had to be seeing something that just wasn't there.<br /><br />I got the book, I sat down, and I read it.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was how poor the writing was.  It wasn't just bad.  It was horrible.  But horrible writing is no crime, (thank goodness or I would have been put away a long time ago) and it doesn't make the content of the story evil.  But in my reading of it, just like my friend said, the theme of child abuse, of pedophilia, was right there in plain sight.  I remember being told a long time ago that sometimes the best way to hide something is in plain sight.  That is what 50 Shades of Grey is really doing.<br /><br />The main character had no sexual experience.  None.  She was an innocent.  She was a kid who had just had her first drink of alcohol.  No way that was an accident by the author.  That author had to have purposely made her, despite her given age of 21, by any other measure, a little girl.  At that point, it struck me as odd.  In my business, we call that a warning signal. A sign we may have a problem.<br /><br />From there, just like my friend had warned, it got worse.  Much worse.  And she was right, her telling me about it did not have the impact of me reading it myself with eyes open.  She had given me the signs to look for, and as I turned the pages, those signs confirmed it over and over again.<br /><br />The narration, which is the voice of the girl talking to the reader, was the voice of a little girl.  It's unmistakable.  There is very little emotional maturity and absolutely no sexual maturity.  She is seduced by this man in the very same way a pedophile seduces a child.  The male character is Gerry Sandusky.  He makesa show of his money, his power, the things he can buy for her, but while this is going on, we are reading the thoughts of a child.  We are reading the seduction of a little girl by a pedophile.  She is almost completely powerless.  She is naïve even for a teenager, and certainly much much more naïve than a college student.  She is incapable of even making the most simple of every day decisions and must be told what to do by her abuser, who in turn though spends a lot of time and effort convincing this child this is really what she wants.  I've seen this before.  Too often.  Too many times.  And it always leaves me sickened.<br /><br />We are reading child pornography.  Remove the false age of the girl, which has no basis in reality, and what we are actually reading is the abuse of a little girl.<br /><br />The main character is described in pigtails, given words like \\"Holy Cow\\"  \\"down there\\", \\"jeez\\"  \\"double crap\\" she can't operate a computer (but is supposedly a college graduate), describes skipping and doing cartwheels, repeatedly says she is made to feel like a child, has her imaginary friend (inner goddess) feels shame, is spanked and slathered in BABY OIL, told what to say, what to eat, what to do, until finally and sadly so predictably, is physically beaten.  (But she returns to him soon after, which is again, a very common theme of abuse, including pedophilia)<br /><br />And beyond all of this evidence there is the fact that the male character is himself a product of sexual abuse at the hands of a pedophile.  The girl whose thoughts we listen in on as she is being abused, recognizes this aspect of the male abuser, but apparently, is too naïve or unwilling to realize she has continued this cycle of abuse herself. (Which again reinforces the idea that she is actually herself just a child)  There is no way the author did this by accident.  She puts out the theme of pedophilia openly, therefore hiding it in plain sight.<br /><br />People who have had to deal with the real world of sexual abuse of children will understand this perhaps more easily than others.  How the pedophile is so often themselves victims of earlier abuse.  They enter society, they become fathers or mothers, but so often they too become abusive.  They seek out dominance, control, and the taking of innocence just as it was taken from them.  Those who were once abused, become the abuser.  It is the sad sick and tragic cycle of pedophilia.<br /><br />With 50 Shades of Grey this abnormal condition is trying to be normalized.  Thanks to the insight of my friend, and my own experience,  I know it for what it truly is - a story of the sexual abuse of child, wrapped in the cliché cover story of a mysterious and troubled wealthy man.  That is another thing my clinical psychologist friend pointed out later.  Take away the aspect of money, and the character of the abuser becomes much less attractive and therefore it would have been much more difficult to pull of the deception.  Are women actually that shallow?  Yes, we can be.<br /><br />But women, the vast majority of us, are not people who knowingly condone the sexual abuse of children.  We do not condone in any way, the horror that is pedophilia.<br /><br />Sadly though, that is exactly what is happening with the popularity of 50 Shades of Grey.  It's a pedophilia con.<br /><br />It is one of the most horrible and sickening acts against the most powerless of our society, hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />Maybe my friend put it best when we talked all of this over.  50 Shades of Grey didn't excite her.  She didn't find it interesting, sexy, or romantic.<br /><br />50 Shades of Grey made her weep.  It made her sick.  It made her think of the abuses of all of those kids by a demented, warped monster like Jerry Sandusky, who, just like the pedophilia of 50 Shades of Grey, was hiding in plain sight.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|People who were utterly offended by this movie on a completely inappropriate level will hate my review, so beware.<br /><br />I waited for this to come out forever. I was in love with it since the trailer. When I saw the movie, everything went even better than expected. I'm not an avid Shakespeare fan, et cetera, so it was easy to think of this as a theory, however entertaining, however flawed, without opening myself up to personal offense. You have to admit it: the movie was interesting. The costumes and makeup were great. The special effects were neat. I'm not exactly the most cultured person in the world, but I could still follow the story and even I found it very interesting. I don't see movies three times and then buy the DVD if they're run of the mill.<br />My review is on its entertainment value, which I PERSONALLY rate FIVE STARS.<br /><br />It was a well put-together story, ALL HISTORY ASIDE. If you think Shakespeare wrote his stuff, good for you. If you think he didn't, fabulous. Get together and go have a soda; no need to get religious about it on Amazon. If the movie was as unbelievable and detached as some say, there's no reason to become an activist. Take it at face value (unless you made yourself hate that too).
1607066017|4.0|When I first started reading Saga, I honestly had no interest in the book itself. I only bought the first issue because I had to buy one to get in the line for Brian K.Vaughn Signing at Midtown Comic Store near Fulton Street New York.But I am glad that I read it. Alright, I won't talk about the story for I read some other reviews and they did a far better job at it then I probably will. Instead, I will talk about the overall quality of the book itself. Now Vaughn is a pretty big name in Comics, and I was under the impression that Image might give it a more marquee treatment. But nope, instead what you get is a run of the mill trade paperback edition with few extras thrown in the mix. I mean come on, would it have killed them to give us fans a more deluxe edition of this awesome book? I know i might sound like a little kid, but I expect A+ writers to and their work to get A+ treatment. Shame on you Image for giving us such a subpar collection of this kick Ass story. I would give this a 5 stars but it loses 1 star solely on the crappy tpb edition. I hope Image comes to its senses and gives us a worthy collection of this story.

B008QE9XD2|3.0|I watched this because it has Johnny Depp.  Plain and simple. I did enjoy it, but I probably won't be watching it over by myself, it will have to be because I'm showing it to someone else.  Why?  Well, frankly, it could have been written better.  Overall, the story was ok, but I would have liked to have more of the history of the story actually played out, and not just quickly reviewed with shots and clips here and there.  Just me, I guess.

B00846REIS|3.0|I recently read Bared to you after finishing the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy.  I found Bared To You storyline very similar to Fifty Shades.  Cons:  I found it very difficult to fall into the book, had a hard time connecting with the characters and actually didn't connect until the second book; and I found the main characters spent more time with the other characters than each other - I was looking for more character development.  Perhaps my comparison to the Fifty trilogy is a bit unfair, but Fifty was so easy to get into (page 3 I was hooked).  With saying that I did enjoy the first 2 books, especially once I was mid way through the 2nd book and am looking forward to book 3 in the trilogy.  I say read it and enjoy it for what it is - a romance.  :)

If you didn't get that this was a film about two men who realize that they are kindred spirits, and their trials and tribulations together, then you missed the point. If you are looking for a straight plot to decide how involved you are in a film, then you cut yourself off from a great film such as this one.

When I went to work I told some people and it turned out they had similar experiences over the past few months.  After a long discussion I realized: my Soul was missing.  Everyone else felt the same way.<br /><br />Then I heard this album. There is too much Soul in these songs.  There's no way it all came from one man.  The only convergent explanation is that Michael Kiwanuka is a Soul Vortex who siphons the Soul from mere mortals and channels it into incredible music.<br /><br />After listening to Home Again a few times, I didn't even care about my Soul problem.  I don't want it back.  If this is what Mr. Kiwanuka is going to do with all the Soul he's gathering, more power to him.  My hat is off.

B008AU7F3C|4.0|I came across Bat For Lashes mostly in part to a tiny 3 x 3 ad in the back of an issue of the now defunct Paste Magazine.  The ad was simple and small, but extremely noticeable amongst the sea of other artists on the pages past the reviews.  It featured a picture of a beautiful woman adorned in gold peacock feathers, sitting in the corner of a boxing ring.  There was something so bizarre and surreal about the image that unlocked something deep within me and made me search the web for her immediately.  \\"[[ASIN:B000TRVK5S Fur And Gold]]\\" was unlike anything I'd ever heard in my whole life and I fell in love almost immediately with Natasha's haunting voice. The songs painted images of animals in the wild and people dancing in a dark forest around campfire, dressed in feathers and furs.  Two years later \\"[[ASIN:B001YAG5DQ Two Suns]]\\" came out.  It retained the mystique that \\"Fur and Gold\\" had, but Natasha perfected her songwriting and kept the same space tribal sound.  I couldn't stop listening to it and each track has gained over a hundred plays since it's release.  Three more years have passed, and now we have Natasha's next endeavor, \\"The Haunted Man\\"<br /><br />  \\"The Haunted Man\\" features a much more matured, even a bit peppier version of the music we've heard on Natasha's last two albums.  While it has lost much of the ethereal feeling that emanated from the heart of \\"Two Suns\\", it's still a fantastic set of music from Miss Khan.  It's easy to hear how much she has grown as a musician over the nine years since \\"Fur and Gold\\".  In a sense you can feel how she has changed over her years of touring and collaborations.  She's created a more up-beat rendition of her signature sound, trading in her harpsichords and tribal drums for a stronger synth presence and electronic drumbeats. Most of the songs here can easily be heard on an alt rock radio station; as opposed to only a select few tracks from past albums I could deem \\"radio worthy\\".  The songs generally are much catchier and \\"poppy\\" than past works, and I often find myself randomly singing chorus lines throughout the day.  Personally I can't help but feel a tiny bit disappointed that her sound has changed, but it's not a complete disappointment as she has crafted some wonderful music in this new sound.<br /><br />  The album has bit of a slow start, but opening track \\"Lilies\\" will start to grow on you after multiple listens.  It's not as memorable as the first tracks from her first two LP's, but it's still a wonderful song.  \\"[[ASIN:B009B0D1Q0 All Your Gold]]\\" is oddly reminiscent in some aspects to Gotye's \\"[[ASIN:B006ZDU8EE Somebody That I Used To Know]]\\" and is probably the only song here that sounds completely out of character for Natasha.  From it's fast muted bass to the odd pace of the wording in chorus; it is without a doubt one of the most energetic sounding she has done.  It's a fine song, but the places where Natasha chooses to hit high notes sound a bit off at times. \\"Horses of the Sun\\" is a catchy tune that has a chorus that I just can't get enough of when I hear it.  \\"Oh Yeah\\" is a funky electronic song that heavily features a chorus chanting 'oh yeah' backed by some spacey synth.  \\"[[ASIN:B008P637KG Laura]]\\" is definitely the strongest song of the whole album, showcasing Natasha's voice at it's most powerful.  It's a slow and subtle song that features only a piano and quiet background horns.  I can't help but get goose bumps every time her voice reaches it's peak in the chorus, it's simply one of the finest songs she's written.  \\"Winter Fields\\" is an atmospheric song with some great orchestral and woodwind parts, interlaced with moody synthesizer work.  It's easily one of the best of the album that unfortunately feels like it is cut short too soon.  Had it been a minute or so longer I'd consider putting on the same level as \\"Laura\\", but sadly it seems to end just as the climax of sounds digs into your heartstrings.  Title track \\"The Haunted Man\\" is a powerful song that includes a men's choir section in it's middle that leads into an explosion of sounds and lyrics by Natasha.  \\"[[ASIN:B009B0D60G Marilyn]]\\" is another one near the top, has a great drumbeat with a catchy chorus.  \\"A Wall\\" is kind of a silly song with its chorus \\"Where you see a wall, I see a door\\".  It's not a bad one by any means, but similar to \\"All Your Gold\\" it seems a bit out of place, even with the pop sound this album has adapted.  \\"Rest Your Head\\" is reminicent of darker 80's synth pop or a more somber M83.  It too features one of the catchier beats of \\"The Haunted Man\\".  The album finishes out with \\"Deep Sea Diver\\" a moody end to the album, but not nearly as final sounding as past albums end tracks.  As for the iTunes bonus tracks \\"Lumen\\" and \\"Daphne\\", they are two very forgettable B-sides, which clearly did not make the final album for a reason.  Both seem unfinished and unrealized, and do not add anything to the album itself.<br /><br />  I have a feeling most people who fell in love with the worlds Natasha molded in \\"Fur and Gold\\" and \\"Two Suns\\" are going to have a hard time listening to \\"The Haunted Man\\" at first.  It's a definite departure from the ethereal and tribal nature of her first two albums, but she's still made some beautiful tracks.  Artists of recent memory like The Strokes, Best Coast and, Interpol have changed their sound over time and sadly lost the quality of their songwriting and style.  Natasha succeeds where most other artists fail.  She is able to morph her sound, while keeping some of her roots, and still create some spectacular music.  Songs like \\"Laura\\", \\"Winter Fields\\" and \\"Marilyn\\" will get within your being much like her previous albums did. While the rest all end up being some fantastic and catchy songs in their own respect.  The album in whole doesn't seem to fit all together as well as past works of Natasha's have.  Instead it consists of a bunch of well made tracks that each have a distinct personality and stand as individuals on their own.  I generally end up loving albums that come together as a whole, but it's hard to consider this an album I love and really connect with like I do her first two.  Individual songs get to me in different ways, but there isn't a universal feeling that the album has when played all together.  \\"The Haunted Man\\" simply has to settle being one I immensely like, rather than one I have a deep love for.ong that includes a men's choir section in it's middle that leads into an explosion of sounds and lyrics by Natasha.  \\"[[ASIN:B009B0D60G Marilyn]]\\" is another one near the top, has a great drumbeat with a catchy chorus.  \\"A Wall\\" is kind of a silly song with its chorus \\"Where you see a wall, I see a door\\".

B009G8GRX6|5.0|The 2nd Law has exceeded my expectations.  I LOVE Muse and this album has made me fall in love with their music all over again.  I just wish I could see it live now!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book was one of the best Ive read this year and I average about two novels a week. The authors ability to make you feel Catherines fear and anxiety is incredible. The book is written in a style that is brilliant as well. It takes a minute to figure out but once you do you realize its necesaary to the story. I also found the story full morsels of information I did not know. If you are looking for a book you will not be able to put down but at the same time is totally beleivable this is the book for you! You wont be dissapointed I promise.
0525953728|5.0|I purchased this book as a birthday gift. Sorry, I did not read. I trust Glenn Beck to do a good job.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy Bejeweled Blitz, and this developer takes the simple match 3 concept and makes it a little more puzzling. Not worth $5, but definitely worth a dollar if you find it on sale.
B0013F1D02|5.0|It is a fantasy movie like Princess Bride.  Not nearly as good as Princess Bride, but that still leaves room to only be a 5 star movie.  :)
B007PFD90G|4.0|I found the book extremely facinating. I thought Rushdie really managed to make the reader understand what it must have felt like to be a hunted man.  The book is fast-paced and well written.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in how Rushie dealt with the fatwa.  I was particularly interested in how it impacted his family, especially his older son.
0553801473|4.0|Like I said in the title, if you are a fan of this series, you'll buy it regardless.  It's not as good as book 1 and book 3 imo, but it's still a great series.
B008NABUU8|4.0|however it is useless on my Kindle Fire. Please optimize for KF! I made it to bridge 3 before all **** broke loose!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I agree with the most recent reviews. This app no longer had much functionality what gives?!  I really enjoyed it before the recent issues began.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|Got this for my son's 3rd birthday and he loves it. It is very well built and the details are very precise. Some reviews say about the durability and I have to say, not a toy will last on the hands of a rough child. My son is not rough with his toys so this one, will last a long time. Great for the price, a backhoe with some many details for under 25 bucks is a steal! I had to buy the bulldozer to play with him and it is  a blast! Both, backhoe and bulldozer, are a huge success for my son and his friends and they look pretty close to the real thing.
B008BIZ06M|3.0|I love Offspring from the 90s and early 2000's, and while there is still a bit of that sound, you can tell that the band has lost a step.  Probably as with other hard core bands that get old - now they're rich and satisfied and they've lost their angst and have nothing to be angry about.<br /><br />At full price, I don't recommend it - but at $5, it's a decent value to fill out your Offspring collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldnt stop reading this book. i kept reading until my eyes were burning and only then would i stop...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|this is a great game for any age.  its an easy story to follow and well worth the 2 bucks!
B000KIPT30|5.0|Sometimes we watch movies were there is some language that our kids complain about, so we bought this to solve that problem! I tried a splitter for 2 headphones from the back of the TV at first and that did not put out enough power for two headphones and then I researched wireless headphones which was way more money than I wanted to spend for only being 10 feet away from the TV, so this option worked great for our LG LED TV which has a headphone jack on the back, and I had to buy a copy extra components. You have to do your own research on what headphones you want to buy, but I will list what I bought.<br /><br />1. Cable to go from the TV to the headhphone amp: [[ASIN:B000V6R2OK Cables Unlimited AUD-1100-25 3.5 mm 25 feet Male to Male Stereo Cable - Black]]<br /><br />2. (5) 1/8 to 1/4 adapter: [[ASIN:B003VGUGBS AudioAdapt LE Quality Headphone Adapter Stereo Gold Plug 1/4-Inch (6.3mm) Male to 1/8-Inch (3.5mm) Female]]<br /><br />3. (4) Headphones: [[ASIN:B0007XJSQC Sennheiser HD201 Lightweight Over-Ear Binaural Headphones]]
B003UPPO2G|5.0|The audio and video is excellent quality. The BeeGees performance was probably at their most developed and polished. Sadly Barry is the only brother still alive otherwise the DVD would definitely have inspired us to see them live. If you like the BeeGees music you will not regret buying this.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|A very good movie I am a child in heart  that is ok will be young for a long time.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|The Haunted Man is a strange, in a good way, album. It is just the right amount of off the wall sounds, beautiful singing, and unusual music.<br /><br />I saw Bat For Lashes at Lollapalooza 2009. They struck me as a really strange group that I would probably like a lot. The rawness of the music was what attracted me. I listened to preview of their other albums and just didn't hear that same strangeness. Along came Haunted Man in 2012, and here it is, that same feeling from their live concert.<br /><br />Bat For Lashes is difficult to describe. Electronica, no not really, but there is a bunch of that going on here and there. Bjork-like, well sort of in a way. Natasha Khan has a similar tone in her voice. Maybe I'm thinking of Bjork's Sugar Cube days. A little bit Belly, but not nearly the hard rock edge, but sort of. This is just strange cool music.<br /><br />Normally I like to review each track, but in this case the album is just a wonderful strange journey from track one to eleven. Rare to put together a CD where the album is a whole and not just random songs thrown together. There is only one song that annoys me a little tiny bit, the one with the baby noises and the odd Alvin and Chipmunks sped up sound. Otherwise this is a genuinely excellent album from start to finish.<br /><br />The cover art sets the tone for the album, different, a bit out there, a bit risqu&eacute;, but yet completely covered all the same. I love the packaging for this CD. Everything is made of paper, the jacket is heavy card stock, and there is a nicely printed matte paper lyrics booklet - including some lovely line drawings.<br /><br />A different album that I really like. Natasha Khan has a beautiful voice that mixes perfectly with the music.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|We try few movies and buy fewer.  This one is a buy especially for young actors who will be grear
B0097EWK3A|5.0|- Spoiler Free -<br /><br />It's been quite awhile since I jumped at a game. The backtracking was not at all annoying due to differences each time an important area was issued and the storyline itself was well written. Thank you!
B009L32R5I|5.0|I have been a Genesis fan since the mid-70s and this album is like a wonderful trip back through time.  The album is not merely nostalgic, however.  It stays very faithful to the original arrangements, but the clarity of modern recording magic reveals the wonderful intricacy and dynamics of these songs.  Hackett is a much better guitar player than he was back in the day and he finally gets to shine, but not in an overbearing way.  For example, the guitars in the end of \\"Supper's Ready\\" were never as \\"present\\" as they should have been in the other recordings by the band.  It's much more powerful in this version.  Likewise, the addition of real orchestration on some tunes, particularly on \\"Can Utility and the Coastliners\\" really adds something special.<br /><br />Hopefully, this album will appeal to younger musicians today and influence their musical futures.  My guitar-playing 13-year old wss impressed at Hackett's chops and guitar tones.  It really says something that these songs still \\"have it\\" after four decades.  Brilliantly executed!
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Came exactly on time in great condition! This is and amazing album and a must have on vinyl for any fan of Jack White or even music in general. Love it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this and it is very user friendly. I find it more accurate than my weather man on the local channel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really good plot; however, disappointed in the amount of foul language.  It would have been just as great a story without it being over run with the F-bomb!!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|I am a HUGE Halo nerd, but was never really a fan of the live action Halo productions before.  I went into this with somewhat low expectations and was blown away.  Many parts, especially the opening sequences between the Chief and Cortana, gave me chills.  Possibly even a tear or two came to my eye.<br /><br />There are a lot of little nods and references to Halo backstory for nerds like me who have read all the books (multiple times), played all the games (even more times) and know way too much about Halo in general.  That being said, it is also very accessible for newcomers.<br /><br />Buy this or suffer the consequences of not knowing what awesome is!!!
0143120581|5.0|This book opened my eyes to not only a much better way to parent your children, but by extension a much better way to parent yourself.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very fun, my kids steal my phone and my kindle all the time to play this game. Even my husband and I get addicted to playing it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|As so many have already covered, this book is told by a 5 year old who is the product of a teenager and her kidnapper.<br /><br />You know by reading the synopsis that the mother and boy escape.  I wanted so badly to get to that part (which is almost half way through and at times not a page turner), that I didn't want to put it down, and then once I got to that part I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what was coming next as it explored the aftermath.<br /><br />When I first finished the book I didn't know if I really loved it.  I felt like the ending was a little rushed.  I wanted the story to keep going and wanted to know more.  But since then, I can't stop thinking about the book.  It's one of those books that continues to simmer and I find myself wanting to find another book that lives up to this one... That's how I know it really was THAT good.<br /><br />This story is very relevant to today, without being a copycat of a story on the news.  I highly recommend reading it, but on a weekend or vacation when you can devote time to reading it cover to cover.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best written novels I have ever written. Takes you away to a fantasy like land..which actually doesn' t seem so far fetched. Throughout this whole trilogy I have genuinely cared for these characters which is a kudos for Suzanne Collins who wrote this magnificent book!
B008NABUU8|3.0|it looks a lot like west point bridge which is a contest online that's for schools and stuff....its really cool though
B004W1GCQO|4.0|Since I am such a fan of British television, this program was a delight to me.  It is well acted and seems to be factual about historical events.
B0094WK9GU|5.0|This album has so many excellent and familiar songs, anyone who is into edm will surely enjoy this album! One last tour is going to be amazing!!
B0012QTT4O|4.0|The pilot for this hit series was very engaging - kept my attention and encouraged me to look for the next episode. Well done!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This step by step guide is easy to follow.  I plan to submit a book to Kindle Soon titled Following the Butterfield Stage Route
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I love British humor and I'm a big fan of John Cleese.  I watched this on PBS years ago and was delighted to be able to own this myself.  I played it for my children, all grown, who thought it was I've watched this so many times, I can almost receipt the dialogue of each show. Extremely entertaining. The Britich humor is very subtle so sometimes you have to listen closely for it but it's there....
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an excellent idea. Simple concept, but great execution. It involves thinking in mathematical terms, using shortest path algorithms in mind to solve. Very interesting and I am addicted!
B004SBX112|2.0|I purchased this game for my Kindle Fire for my Grandson's and I did not get the app on my Kindle!!!
0345525558|5.0|Wonderful book and I got it quickly through the mail. We enjoyed a lively discussion at our book club. You won't forget it!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The rules are simple but the games are quite challenging.Some take a number of attempts and if you get really stuck there are points earned that can show the solution.I would like to see a hint available with just several begining moves and not the complete solution.The accompaning music is soothing if just a little repetative.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|instantly addictive polished jazz / funk grooviness... easily a 5star in the vastness of mediocrity they call music now a day...
1607066017|5.0|To reiterate my title... Saga is amazing.  It is not very often that I purchase a monthly comic book and then go back and purchase a trade paperback.  Some reasons why you should get Saga: fantastic story, interesting characters, tongue-in-cheek sci-fi humor, great dialogue, incredibly awesome artwork, and excellent page vs. price (seriously, 160pgs for $10?).<br /><br />I've seen other reviewers not particularly fond of the characters, setting, etc.  It may not be for everyone.  Fair warning: there is quite a bit of sexual content, gratuitous violence, and \\"what-the-heck?\\" moments.
B003B02O14|4.0|Great book!  John Grisham has done it again!  Love his novels! He knows how to grab you and you can't put it down!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this I app is great. it really reminds me when my battery is low. I also love the feature where it tells you how much longer you can web browse. awesome app!
B008M34INW|1.0|I purchased the video while out of town for a conference and assumed that the video would remain available until viewed.  I learned a $4 lesson the hard way.  The Internet at my hotel wasn't reliable so I had to wait a day and a half to watch it at home.  It had expired.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like it the clock but wish there were more choices for alarms.  also wish there were louder options so I actually get up when time.
B002C6K7NA|5.0|I have read some of the negative comments about this CD on amazon. They want them to sound like they did in the 70's. Even if all the original members were alive, they would have developed their sound to what today's music is to some degree. I believe they would sound very similar to this record. We don't have 3 min guitar solo's anymore like we had in the 60's and 70's. Many bands today detune the guitars down to get that heavier sound and thats what they do on this one.<br /><br />With that being said, this is a great CD. I like every song on it and love most of them. The musicianship is very good, vocals are great, strong, and heart felt. The lyrics are home down about the things that are so important to all of us. They sing about the things we all think and talk about among family and friends. They have some nice acoustic songs as well as heavier songs. Going to Blackbird studio was a big plus as they know how to engineer records. This is a great CD.
B00112ASYO|5.0|These are very sturdy, though small, so be sure to check the measurements before you order.  They were perfect for us since they were used as a work giveaway, and most now live on desks.  Glad they had enough in stock and they shipped very quickly.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of novellas is simply amazing. They are so good that I was very excited to learn that the movie rights have been purchased even though, as we all know, the book is always better than the movie. I will definitely be reading more from this self-published author!
B000W94FE6|4.0|I found the book to be fascinating.  It is well researched and very pragmatic. He stops short of explaining how to go about putting more \\"flow\\" into your life and he is unapologetic about this not being a \\"how to\\" book.  After reading \\"Flow\\" I read Authentic Happiness by Martin Seligman and that does try harder to tell you how to do it.
B005QPMB2Y|4.0|Probably not intended for the Kindle Fire, but written for that version.<br /><br />I watch more than 40 cameras online using this program, and for the most part it works great, but it does crash occassionally (mostly because of network timeouts)<br /><br />Very highly recommended.<br /><br />EVEN BETTER: If you don't know the version of the camera system you have, hidden under manage cameras (located rather), is a \\"Scan Camera\\" feature. No, this doesn't rotate the camera's one by one, it scans the type of communication method it uses, and makes it easy to add. Do this locally, as it will still take about 10-15 minutes. by remote, not worth the time (hour or better).<br /><br />Helped me add other boxes I couldn't even identify.<br /><br />As for my cell phone, I had to replace my phone, and the paid version was automatically installed on the replacement. Very happy.
B008NABUU8|5.0|i major in structure and i find it interesting because it shows where u need to improve and offer different material to build.
B00003CY0V|5.0|The Swordfidh DVD arrived within the projected time in fine shape.  This was a trip down memory lane for me, and it was as good the second time as the first. An early casting of Travolta as the antagonist and Haley Berry as his \\"partner in crime\\" was good :-)!!  The rest of the cast was in fine form also.  While this will not rate as one of my all time favorite movies, it will certainly remain in my DVD collection for \\"when I am in the mood for\\"......
B008XG1X18|5.0|love this! this is so addicting and helpful. best app! you will love it too. definitely helps with all things...fashion..crafts...hair...home decor and more.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I've been reading some of King's not so scary books lately....I did look forward to reading this book every night before I went to sleep. King didn't really tell us why these boys were walking or why they wanted to in the first place!  He brought the characters to life tho so you could know each individual's personality.  The ending was NOT tied up and I was left questioning did he or didn't he survive?<br />Or win?  Overall, it was a good read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Best plot and characters in a mystery I've read in years. Never sure who is the good guy/girl or bad guy/girl. The ending a little unbelieveable but these are such unusual characters, you'll probably accept as normal for them.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This was an inspiring and motivating movie on sacrificial missionary work for The Lord. It is selfless and compassionate, somethng this world is lacking today. May you offer many more stories like this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love to play this in my spare time. my family really love to play it as well. some of the games are a little tricky but still very enjoyable.
B008MEM24S|5.0|we love perry in our house, my 4 year old loves playing this game and he is pretty good at it.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I pretty much stay away from hyped up series books because that's usually what they are. Hype. But I decided to give this one a go because I'd gotten the first and second books free from someone who usually takes months to finish a book. She finished each in a matter of days. So I read them. They were fabulous. The last book was as good as the first. It kept me going. You felt for the characters...all the injustices they were facing. I liked the end even though I felt bad for Gale. I would almost have liked to learn what actually became of Gale...maybe a fourth book? Who knows. Either way I thoroughly enjoyed the series.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent filming and acting, one of the best TV productions ever, the casting is perfect, writing superb and historical reference/staging phenominal.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Sometimes Amazon reviews are tedious, particularly when I'm not decided on the product. I wasn't in to the first chapter/section of atlas cloud, but I kept reading, and am now on character number three. I'm hooked! The stories intertwine with each other.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|Stone Sour for me has been one of those rare bands that puts out good music time and time again, while evolving in the process. Simple as that.
B0025UHKNS|2.0|When I first got the Garmin 405cx last Christmas, I was so excited!  I used my bulky Garmin 205 for 5 years and loved it, but was ready for something smaller and more sophisticated.  Problem is, after almost a year, the watch has more and more problems.  As a marathon runner I need a reliable watch, so this one's going to get the boot and I'll go with a more simple model.  I have two other friends with this watch and won't use them in races because the watch is unreliable.  Here's what I don't like about the 405cx:<br /><br />  1.) Set-up isn't the easiest for somebody who's just an average tech-user<br />  2.) I sweat when I train in the summer for my races.  It's hot outside; it happens.  This watch doesn't handle it so well.  In fact often the Bezel completely freezes and I lose my elapsed time and pace.  Ditto for water of any kind.  I ran a half marathon in light rain and the watch's training feature simply stopped.<br />  3.)In recent weeks, one of the buttons got stuck and I can't budge it.  Instead, the watch watch beeps nonstop, the screen scrolls all by itself, and the bezel will randomly lock and unlock.  It is now unusable.<br /><br />I do like a few things, but not enough to ever buy another one of these:<br />  1.) Smaller size<br />  2.) Wireless technology with ANT agent<br />  3.) Virtual Partner function
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This book has been an inspiration to me as a runner who runs about 12 miles per week. There have been some great tips on the physical aspects of running as well as the mental side of the sport. Not only that, but this is a fascinating story about athletes who are known as ultra runners (those who run 100 miles). The author himself is a runner who learned the techniques of ultra running from a tribe that  lives in the Copper Canyon of Mexico called the Tarahumara. It is a fascinating story that would be appealing to those who do not run, but it is especially interesting and entertaining for those who do.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Love, love, love the Heat books! this one was great too.  just like the other one. the last in the  trilogy \\"Frozen Heat\\" comes next.  love the tv show too. Never miss Castle,!!!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I thought that this was a fantastic and well produced film and I enjoy watching it over and over. Some of the negative reviews that I read on this movie before I bought it were people expressing disappointment in the fact that you don't get to see that much of Jimmy, Edge, and Jack playing together. This is true so if you're hoping for some sort of a concert/performance video of these three then this movie is probably not for you. What it does give you is a very fun and interesting look at the characters behind the music and how they became who they are. I think what I enjoy the most is the insight into the emotions and the thought process that goes into how they play guitar and how they write music. There are plenty of great sound clips and performances too which really come to life with the included narrative. I also love the interaction between the three and the jam session at the end is worth the wait. I love rock documentaries and this one is one that I'm very pleased to have in my library.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Much better than the first book. Good story line, though I have to wonder where Gideon gets his stamina. Looking forward to #3
B005LAIHY0|2.0|I love all the \\"Alien\\" movies, and I have to tell you that this one is not one of them. Maybe as a separated story will be fine, but the fact that it has being related to the first one makes it a complete fiasco.<br />Yes the special effects are good, and some of the actors have a very nice performance, but the way the story was handle is wrong. They should watch the first movie one more time before they made this one. On the first one there were eggs with those nasty \\"hands\\" we all love. On this one they have pods with some black goo stuff that does not add any suspense to the film.<br />The big alien with the broken chest was found inside their ship sitting on the control chair, not inside a human vessel next to a squid like creature.<br />I could understand all the discrepancies if the creator of Prometheus was some one else. But this is not the case.<br />In any way this movie is not what it claims to be.<br />I am really disappointed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Well done both as a mission and as an account of the mission.  Politicians need to allow our military to do what they do best which is a point made to a degree in the book.  The book details the meticulous planning that goes into the missions carried out by our servicemen and women. The cool manner in which the Seals adjusted to the copter crash speaks volumes for their training and skill.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|my daughter received this movie as a birthday present.  She was SO excited that she jumped up and down when she got it.<br />She likes the idea of having all the discs included since she thought that she was only going to get 2 like in the stores<br />I have only had 1 problem with all of my Amazon orders and that was quickly rectified to my liking.
1451696191|2.0|I heard amazing things about this book but I must say I found it completely disappointing. I was looking forward to reading it and I will admit it had the potential of greatness or at least being semi-good but it does not live up to that potential.<br /> The main character Charlie is not all that interesting. He is actually quite boring. What saves \\"perks\\" from being completely unbearable to read are Charlie's friends Sam and Patrick. Honestly the book would have been better if it was narrated by one of them instead; their stories seem far more interesting than Charlie's.<br /> The biggest problem with this book is it tries too hard. Every difficult subject is mentioned (i.e. suicide, rape, abortion) but not explored by the narrator in any real way. Everything is glanced over and unrealistic.<br /> I've read worse books than this one but I still would not recommend it to anybody.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|its a relaxing game and doesnt need real money to play if you just have a little patience and wait for coins to accumulate.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Great music! Really enjoyed this soundtrack. Made me realize how much I missed the old music. Made me pull out the rock albums I have not listened to in a long time.
B000X1T7MS|3.0|The book is  informative, although some of the author's conclusions appear to be \\"Opinion\\" based on selected \\"facts\\". As a reader I am left  with a suspicion that facts contrary to the author's may also be valid.<br /><br />At any rate this is a broad subject that can not be explored in depth in a single book.<br /><br />Overall, met my expectations as an overview of ISLAM.<br /><br />Additional reading needed for the truly curious.
B009IJJ712|4.0|I love this modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes. The show moves, the characters hold my interest and plots, so far, have been good. Aiden Quin is a grat foil for the Holmes character. So glad they haven't made the detective a dolt. This Watson incarnation is interesting as well.
B005BOX7BE|5.0|This is a clever show; love the characters, the endings are often predictable; I'm hoping they \\"change it up\\" a bit as time goes on.  Kudos to the writers and actors for actually make me Laugh Out Loud!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I rarely read fantasy or Knights of the Realm style books. I purchased this book because of the numerous high quality reviews. The readers  know best, as this was one entertaining, well written, exciting book.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Up front, let me say my favorite SP albums in order are MC, Machina I, Adore, Siamese and then Gish (so I'm not too much into grunge).  So take that into consideration...<br /><br />I like Oceania but I think it pales in comparison to Corgan's best work.  The problem for me is the melodies aren't that strong- perhaps that's also because Corgan seems to have lost his soft whispery falsetto, which he used to great effect on songs like disarm, tonight, 1979, etc.<br /><br />So I may or may not buy new SP albums in the future.  However, I'm looking forward to buying Machina II, which is supposed to be re-released next year.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest is an excellent place to plan and share ideas and learn new things, it's so good it's almost addictive... My only complaint is that the app doesn't always function properly on my Kindle.
B00984668E|5.0|Apocryphon has new sounds and new band members. However, all of the tracks are solid, build well upon the previous albums and have all of the trademark lyrics and riffs. For instance, the solid Fantasy tie-ins that you may have come to expect from albums other than Warp Riders (which is a concept album) are back on this album, like Dying Earth (Jack Vance). I've seen these guys many times since Age of Winters came out. Glad that their careers have come such a long way since I first saw them opening for a crappy band, in a crappy bar, off the beaten track here in Denver. It was really cool to see them make it onto the Metallica Tour and Guitar Hero game. To the point, this album is another great reason to get out there and see these guys Live! Imagine that this is why there are a few Live, high energy, teaser tracks on the album. They really are a unique Live experience.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Had a great plot kept u entertained from start to finish. cant wait for house of hades. it is going to be great
B002LB7S10|5.0|Great movie.  Spooky, gory with lots of suspence.  Enjoyed it very much.  Would recommend for those who enjoy a good scare without all the special effects.
B005COO1X6|3.0|Excellent read, but could have gone much farther with the story line. A classic King story, just needed a little more.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I was skeptical about reading a book about vampires and witches, but was very surprised in how much I enjoyed it. There is a lot of history that makes the story so intriquing and the relationship between the different characters was also fasinating. It is a well written book and I am already started the second book.
B004IJY4L0|5.0|This is just the right type of music when slamming through calculus. Great bass, with a fast up-beat rhythm. Not slow and mediocre.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|it works great on my kindle. i love it. i was waiting forever for omgpop to make it and when they did i was so excited
B000H7J9QM|4.0|FUN MOVIE, PLENTY OF FAST ACTION....I'M A BIG NICK CAGE FAN AND ALTHOUGH THIS ISN'T HIS BEST, I WOULD RECOMENT IT.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have tried evernote on and off and not having a word processor on kindle fire helped me use this app more often. Plus this is the only app I found other than skype which cwn be used to click pictures using my kindle fire hd. sweet :)..ofcourse other features of this app are priceless as well.
0345803485|4.0|I love this series.  It is very erotic and includes MS&M.  I had only read one other series that had a female S&M submissive.  But more than than the sex, it also contains references to the romance book genre especially books featured during the 1800 hundreds.  Some of the things to look for is the mention of Christian's white shirt.  In the many of the romance books, it is mention about the main male character white linen shirt, and how significant it is to the main female character attraction to him.  Also, the main female character is a virgin, who never had an interest in having sex with her earlier male friends.  Many, but not all the main female characters in the 1800 romance novels are virgins.  Sometimes the main male character from these books do not realize they are, until they complete the first full sex act.  In this book and well as the books written about the 1800's period, the men all have the same reaction, they are elated and feel even more of a special bond.  This is normally the first virgin these male characters have.  They love the female character's innocence and always see this as the best sexual experience they ever had.<br /><br />What is also refreshing, as in the character Eve Dallas in J.B. Robb series - In Death, is that the female character is not interested in the male character for his wealth, but she is wants him for him.<br /><br />I am so looking for the next book in this series, there are other characters to explore, but I am mostly interested in the author to do a book in Christian Grey's voice.  A teaser in his voice and reactions is given in the third book of the trilogy.<br /><br />This series offer love, and mystery as many of the romance genre books do.  Romance genre is the most sold genre books of this time.  Romance genre books are guilty pleasures.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game is addicting! Finding the hidden objects and solving the puzzles is challenging and fun at the same time. The game was put together very well. Playing the part as a detective is awesome! The clues you have to find and use really makes you think. I would recommend this to everyone that loves to play puzzle and hidden object games!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have read all of Mitch Albom's books and this one is just as good as all the others.  He captivates the reader with stories that are different each time and tend to keep you from putting the book down. I loved it.  Totally different from any other author's stories.
B008NABUU8|1.0|I have a kindle fire and it keeps freezing it. I wish I was able to play more of the game then I did but after the 3rd one it froze 4 times I delete it

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|I enjoyed the movie although it did seem that some of the actors appeared bored with their parts.  It was enjoyable from purely an entertainment viewpoint.
1878424114|5.0|I have found this small easy book full of insightful information to encourage me to think beyond my experiences. I am in the process of practicing a few steps mentioned: write your intentions and read them every morning and night. In doing so I have found it is easier to stay on track with my goals. A challenge for me is \\"no judgement\\" for the day. I slip, but continuing to practice I am conscious when doing so and get back to my intentions. I plan to continue to study this book and in fact bought five and shared with the intention of a study group. So far, all have agreed. Let's see.
B001BANK32|5.0|As the author of [[ASIN:B005MF8AYQ A Ghost of Fire (Ghostly Elements)]] I've had my share of contact with Paranormal Thrillers. This is in my opinion one of the greatest and most classic works. Forget the Kubric film which knows virtually nothing of Jack's character development. This is where you need to go for a good thrill. HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend!
0790729652|5.0|I wanted this DVD to complete my Batman collection. The product was in excellent condition when received and shipping was quick. The movie itself was excellent but then I am a bit biased since I am a huge Batman fan!!
B005LAIHYU|1.0|I am so disappointed. I read the book and loved it. My hopes were high going into the movie. I was even willing to accept some changes and less depth. Unfortunately, ALL the depth is gone, sacrificed for action scenes. Good luck figuring out what is going on beyond the superficial action. They even change the flavor of the book, adding characters that didn't exsist, to make it more racially motivated. What a waste.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />OK, I wanted to like this movie, really, really, wanted to, so I watched it a second time. Unfortunately, it reinforced what I originally thought. I don't even know where they got some of this stuff. The book was amazing. Just follow it and you have a hit that you KNOW people like. Here they lobotomized it and put in a bunch of ridiculous CGI and action shots. I think that using him for AL:VH was a huge mistake. As I watched the film for the second time I became more and more angry at the director. I don't think he read the book at all, just took the title and made up his own garbage. He should have used some of the budget for colon cleansing, to clear his mind of feces. Actually, maybe he did spend the money on enemas and such. It is not evident in the shabby CGI that would have looked bad in the 1990's, or the practical makeup, which is SO BAD I actually thought Abe's fake beard was going to peel off. Abe when he is older looks like a pig in a hat; its that bad. Hopefully the next time this bozo is considered as a film director the studio will pick a human instead.<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />AH ha ha ha ha...Ole Abe is in \\"Springfield\\" when he settles down at the start. I am surprised this director didn't have Homer Simpson and family (as cartoons mixed with the live performers) shop at the store where he worked, or join him hunting vampires.or join him hunting vampires.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It finished off the trilogy very well.  It was very violent and sad and a little confusing with all the characters but compelling to read.  You would have been lost if you hadn't read the other two books first but you could not have read the other two without reading the third one.<br /><br />Overall, it is a very thought provoking read and very enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it very fun you can be creative and play survivel ind this game I know that It don't have a lot @f pics but its great did u know u can fly hunt kill on survivel
B0061PEAUY|5.0|First time reading a Kathy Reich novel. Am hooked and will definitely read more of her books. Lots of twists and turns leaving you wondering what is going to happen next. Would recommend to anyone who likes mystery books.
B00936A0ZW|3.0|Love Paul Gilbert's instrumetal stuff and when i saw the name of his new cd Vibrato, i thought look out this is going to be guitar crazy, crazy, but it's still not bad thank you
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Loved this book!! Love does always find a way! Love the way it all comes together!! Really looking forward to entwined in you!! Well done Sylvia!!
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Thats the only thing i hear wrong with this cd, the songs are really good,the Don's voice is good, but were's that super clear, crisp sound like on Morph the Cat, no super punch drum, if you know what i mean and when is the Don going to remaster the Nightfly it's been 32yrs, it's not remastered on the Triligy thank you
B008XCPO2Q|3.0|To add on to the numerous complaints that the DVD version does not have the bonus features stated, the blu-ray only version ALSO DOES NOT have the bonus features.  It looks like the features may only be on the combo pack, if that. The blu-ray-only version only has a super short behind the scenes featurette (like 6 minutes), and not the dance moves that I was sooo looking forward to.  The movie itself is ok, but lets face it ladies, who cares about the plot line when hot guys are stripping for us in the privacy of our homes!
B006LSZECO|1.0|I really enjoyed the book and then it just stopped being the story I was reading about. Kind of pissed me off actually.  I was extremely disappointed!  I have recommended this book and I'm sorry I did now that I know the ending.
B00012QLQ4|5.0|I don't like paying a lot for movies and that's why I really like when I can get a classic movie on DVD without all the needless extra junk like bonus discs, making of and commentary stuff. Do you want to know about the making of your coffee maker? No, you just want the coffee.<br />That is what is so great about the GENEON-Pioneer 2001 issue of Akira. It's digitally remastered. It has 5.1 Dolby English audio. It has anamorphic widescreen. It has THX omptimizer and has a neat \\"capsule Option\\" that translates that Japanese graffiti. That is all I need and I paid like around $4.00 and this included the original DVD case and disc with no scratches.<br />All that said, Akira is an absolute classic that you should have in your collection. Akira is a total mind melt. If you have not seen this movie then you should buy the GENEON Akira today. I've wathced this disc twice so far and am way happy with GENEON edition.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book is exactly the same as Fifty Shades of Gray.  Had I read this one first I would have thought Fifty Shades was copied.  Names are changed but characters share problems just as in Fifty Shades.  This writer is more graphic in her descriptions of sex acts.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|This was a very sad movie I with Jack had lived at the end the movie looks and sounds good with lots of special features
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Bought the book apprehensively, but as soon as I started reading I truly enjoyed the book. No real government secrets given out, but I can imagine what it was like being in the Seals.
B004SIP7US|5.0|A very good movie with a good cast Leo DiCaprio Daniel day Lewes and Cameron Diaz it has good picture quality and good fight scenes I give it 5 of 5
B000M9BPEY|4.0|\\"Big Fish\\" is a wonderful example of what can happen in film making, when imagination, ambition, and production values all come together in the correct ratios. What's most notable about this movie is how vastly different it is from Burton's other efforts. It still retains his quirky signature, which works perfectly with the odd subject matter and story presentation. However, most of Burton's movies have been so similar in content and visual style, that they all blur together for me. With \\"Big Fish\\", he went outside his comfort zone, and created something more colorful and heartfelt than anything else in his impressive resume. \\"Big Fish\\" is ideal for anybody who relishes the use of imagination, and yearns for a good yarn.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Everything about this is good no complaints I wish this was cheaper this is defiantly jam pact I hate jam
B008GVD6D8|3.0|Cross fire was great. It got me hooked from page one. Yes it was obviously riding on the coat tails of fifty shades of grey, to many similarities to not pick that up straight away but by half way through I was obsessed with Gideon just the same as I was with Christian Grey. Which was \\"a lot\\"!!! So hurry up Cross Fire and bring me number three
B005LAIHY0|3.0|This movie is a prequel to alien but directer Riddle Scott says it' not a prequel to alien it's an OK move not as good as alien
B0083SBJXS|4.0|It has to be good, Joss Whedon did a good job on the action and dialog, and his brand of humor. Wife says \\"it's too loud\\", so it must be ok, she hates everything else I like in movies...

B00CRBGXZG|5.0|Note: I have seen every episode in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />After the shocking season finale, what would happen in the Hamptons? And was Emily's task really complete? Not by a long shot. Her journey has only just begun, and each episode opens up new avenues to explore. You never know where the road to REVENGE will lead. Just follow Mr. Kelley and the brilliant team of writers...<br /><br />The Season II finale is everything the writers promised, and more. Heart-pounding. Jaw-dropping. Nail-biting. Heart-breaking. Suspenseful. Intense. Burning questions from Season I are answered...and even more are posed for Season III.<br /><br />To say anything more would spoil the fun. So, just sit back and enjoy the delicate dessert neatly packaged as a box of REVENGE.

B009K0OPQQ|5.0|Note: I'm watching this show with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />After an incredible first season, including a very emotional season finale, Once Upon A Time roars back with a vengeance, literally. ABC continues to do right by this series, and the stakes are getting higher with each episode. The way Emma makes her entrance is pure genius on the writers' part and absolutely perfect. I nearly cried during that scene. Keep it up, ABC.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The game was fun at first. Then when you would play more and more because you like it. Then it would get hareder and therefor it would make the game very boring! And don't get Angry Birds Space. Its a wast of money. Everybody please take my advice. So Angry Birds or not its up to you. ;) see ya later This is Brooke saying goodbye for now. And thanks to all my fans out there who take my advice.  Love you guys

B008133DO8|5.0|The quality of acting and story lines are so high in these \\"episodes\\" it is much more like watching a trilogy of films. They are highly entertaining. I just hate it will be so long before the next season is released.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game didn't seem that great when I first got it, but now I can't stop playing it! Just keep completing the missions til you beat them all and then start again! They add new missions all the time too! I've been playing this game almost every day for over a month and I'm still not tired of it. It's challenging but not so hard that it's not fun. Very entertaining!

0812992784|5.0|Dear Salman,<br /><br />I am wondering what is the best way to thank somebody whom you haven't known in person; but who, as matters go in the third person, has given you things most valuable in life - associations, thoughts, ideas, experiences, learning, and above all the joy of reading...bridging the geographical, cultural, experiential, societal, cerebral, and all such boundaries through pieces of vellum...<br /><br />I very much enjoyed reading through Joseph Anton and I read it as slow as I could, not only to fully appreciate and grasp the true intent and meaning of what you had to say, but also to make sure that I could stay with the book as long as I could. And as I finished the last page and handed over the book for my father to read, I realized a few things -<br /><br />(a) I will go back to the book - probably read it cover to cover once again.<br /><br />(b) I am glad I bought it and did not lend it from a library. This will be a book that will be on my SOS shelf - the ones that I go back to again and again. Some of the other ones on that shelf are East of Eden (Steinbeck), The remains of the day (Ishiguro), The diary of a nobody (Grossmith), Three men in a boat (Jerome K Jerome)...Joseph Anton will join these.<br /><br />(c) It is a memoir yes, but not limited to being a memoir. It is far bigger than one person's experiences...it is reflective and an astute observation of far reaching societal changes that have crept in the last 20-25 years. It is also a critical examination of religion as a whole which is admirable.<br /><br />(d) On the personal side as well, this can't be the story of one man...it  is your story indeed (not many will have such an eventful story, and thank God for that!), but it contains snippets and incidents, small and large in equal measure, from many other lives. The love of a father, the deep sense of guilt and frustration on marital and paternal matters, the eternal struggle to rise against the odds and live by one's principles and deep seated notions of right and wrong...these are all shared stories...<br /><br />(e) Throughout the book your voice sounds honest, reflective, analytical, all layered with great wit. I reckon it would not have been easy to look at your life with such openness. I imagine your use of third person might be an aid to distance yourself metaphorically from the YOU, and it has worked brilliantly.<br /><br />The world has vilified Rushdie, and the Salman has had to struggle for his integrity, both mental and emotional. But the writer and the person, that is Salman Rushdie has lived by his guiding principles, and again thank God for that!<br /><br />I am not sure Salman if I still know how to thank you, but I guess you get the drift.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|A Sci-Fi Classic, has a lot of elements that come back in later science ficition movies. The Matrix for example, also about a hacker/software engineer breaking into a program. The graphics are 1982, but still look cool and never outdated. That might be the major plus. Also good to see Bridges in a role that he would play a lot more after this.
B003TOH8AE|4.0|Not one to watch with the kids but was very entertaining.  Seemed like a National Lampoonesque superhero movie.  Very violent scenes were suprising - like Mortal combat almost.<br /><br />Fun to watch!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great story, the characters become your friends... This was a book I did not want to put down. Great history information that brought back all kinds of memories

B009329ZF2|3.0|This movie was a lot better than I expected. The plot or story line was plausible and gave way to actually happening. The acting......well, it was entertaining.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Spellbinding thriller!  Set in today's mideastern caldron of turbulance, intrigue, and constantly changing cast of characters.  Infused with Washington politics. Best series yet!  Enjoyed immensely!

B003O86FMW|4.0|A continuation of the lives of the winners. Starts slow and I almost quit a few times, but then the story and the excitement takes over and makes this a winner.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Girl Gone was an interesting book, very cleverly written but a bit drawn out in places. Ending was a bit far fetched.<br />An average read.
B006QPVGKG|3.0|I enjoyed this movie but from the trailer I expected more. I like the typical conspiracy theory movies so I was curious to see this. I thought it could have used a lot more suspense, more mystery, and a better ending.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This game is pretty fun and I would recommend it to any of my friends! Actually, I would recommend it to anyone!
B003PBB4ME|5.0|I've read some negative reviews and was hesitant to buy it but I've decide I'll try it anyways. I'm glad i did. It's a very good quality, sturdy, I like the foam handle. Better would be only made of aluminium, but that would be more expensive.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app if you just need a basic calculator. The developer should also create a scientific version.
B000002P72|4.0|Huge blues fan and musician.I have hundreds of blues recordings from 1920's to present and have to say I prefer Albert to BB, maybe even Freddie.BB has always been more of an entertainer & singer to me than guitarist.Not knocking his chops but even this CD announces him as the best blues singer.He converses between songs while the band keeps playing as he introduces the next, giving it a medley feel I'd expect in a Vegas showroom vs. smokey blues club.The crowd is great.This CD, in my opinion is far superior to \\"Cook County\\" which I reviewed previously.I'd appreciate any BB recommendations.
0525953728|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the military or has any desire to read about the military.
B0067QPVJ6|4.0|It's hard to trump a classic (let alone two classics), and this remake doesn't really do that. And yet 2011's THE THING offers up its own brand of watchability. First, you should know that this isn't a reboot. It's instead a prequel to John Carpenter's 1982 adaptation (which itself is an updating of Howard Hawk's original 1951 version). All three films are inspired by John W. Campbell's novella \\"Who goes There?\\"<br /><br />It's always appreciated when the lead character manages to keep a cool head in trying circumstances, and especially in a survival horror flick. Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays paleontologist Kate Lloyd who couldn't pass up an opportunity to take part in an expedition to a remote research outpost in Antarctica, where a gamechanging discovery awaits. And when stranded members of the international team begin to get killed off one by one in horrifying ways, it's Kate Lloyd who keeps it together. She's the one who best applies her analytical skills. Hunted by an otherworldly predator that can replicate human flesh and so pass as one of them, Kate figures out the one other thing - what with the blood test having been sabotaged - that may penetrate the thing's deception. She uses this rule of thumb to unmask the final alien disguise, a feat that addressed one of my beefs (which was why was she not checking this one certain person?). I need to brush up on my powers of observation, because it was obvious once she pointed it out. So I like that the story lays out the ground rules and then adheres to them.<br /><br />I've had friends complain that this newest iteration is too slavish in its homage to John Carpenter's version, that the homage veers too close to mimicry. And maybe it's so. I tend to regard this movie as a companion piece, a complementing prelude. To paraphrase the DVD's audio commentary, the filmmakers had to dabble in a bit of reverse engineering. It addresses the shocking sights witnessed by R.J. MacReady and Dr. Copper as they explored the blasted Norwegian camp early in Carpenter's film. That bloody fire axe on the door. The radio operator with his throat slashed. That block of ice with the hollowed cavity. The burnt carcass of a two-headed freak. We learn how they got to be that way. Those poor doomed Norwegians (played by actual Norwegian actors).<br /><br />A sense of paranoia and distrust permeates the film, naturally. And a sense of melancholy, as well, because, going in, we knew the outcome of this story. I thought the film was good but was undermined by that feel of been there, done that. There isn't enough time given to character development so that when the victims start getting weeded out, there's not enough investment in them, excepting Winstead's competent paleontologist. The f/x crew works with practical effects and CG to flesh out the monster(s) but really does nothing to improve on the 1982 beastie which, back in 1982, was considered a groundbreaking creation. The allure instead lies in watching Mary Elizabeth Winstead breathe life into a sensible Ellen Ripley-type role (and tote a flamethrower) and in that the film allows us to revisit John Carpenter's nightmarish world.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />The DVD's bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio Commentary by director Matthijs van Heijningen and producer Eric Newman<br />- 7 Deleted/Extended Scenes (totaling 00:09:16 minutes)<br />- \\"THE THING Evolves\\" - the Making Of featurette (00:14:00 minutes)<br />- Fire & Ice - the special effects crew and stunt doubles have fun lighting themselves and other things on fire (00:04:48 minutes)asted Norwegian camp early in Carpenter's film.

B004L9MFM2|5.0|i am not a fantasy reader. however, after watching the first season of game of thrones, i decided to give the books a go, and am so glad i did. i can't read them quickly enough, yet i make myself go slowly and savour every word. am now on book 3 of the series, and looking forward to book 4 (and 5, and 6, etc).<br /><br />what's to like? well developed characters, some strong female characters, the layers of stories and character traits - just when you think you've made your mind up about something or someone, you get new information and have to change your opinion...at least until the next time, considering the wealth of perspectives given in each book. plus, the writing itself is top quality stuff.<br /><br />i envision a song of ice & fire becoming one of my annual series reads.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves speculative fiction or action adventure! Great pacing, solid character development and well fleshed environments to keep you turning pages. My only complaint, as with all great books...never long enough!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This story is so timely and interesting, I'm shocked no one has tackled this idea on TV before.  At least it seems completely fresh. Everything about it, acting,writing, editing seems top notch.  I'd liken this to the Sopranos in its widespread appeal.  We love it.
B004HW7JH4|2.0|I OWN SEASONS 1-4 AND THE VIDEO/AUDIO QUALITY WAS VERY GOOD.  SINCE I ENJOY THIS SERIES SO MUCH THAT I WAS HAPPY WHEN SEASON 5 BECAME AVAILABLE.  THE QUALITY OF VIDEO/AUDIO IS SUBSTANDARD AND I CANNOT IMAGINE WHY?  VERY DISAPPOINTED ... SAVE YOUR MONEY.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|All 4  of us sat down to watch this,My hubby, teen son,teen daughter,and myself. We liked so much it has become a request on Christmas list. We all liked this movie.  It is very enjoyable to have whole family like a movie. This is  packed full of action and color and laughs too. Iron man- can be very funny! Saw the individual characters movies-but all of them together is really great!
B004VMVTNU|2.0|For the most part, this app served me well. I liked the gentle fading in of the alarm. However, today is the second time I've woken up late to find it &quot;going off&quot; completely silently. Even when I try sampling a different ringtone, they're all silent-- until I actually set a new one and go back to sample them again. My alarm volume is at 100% and doesn't change. I can't be late to work again.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is an awesome trilogy of books! I fell in love before I finished book 1. By the time I got to book 3 I started to wonder, where is this going? Overall, E.L. James, wrapped it up pretty well. It has some really fun and entertaining moments. If you finished book 1 and 2 then you gotta see it all the way to the end.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I read the 50 Shades Trilogy.  If you enjoyed that you will love this.  I found there to be more of a story line.  Still hot, but more going on!
0140449337|5.0|This book is very good. I feel that it applies to everyone and anyone can benefit by reading it. The harder part is to put Marcus Aurelius's wisdom into practice...
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|This game turned out to be rather dull and boring.  I shall probably give it another go, someday, but no time soon. I didn't expect thrills & chills with this type of game, but....yawn.
B00000IREA|5.0|Fantastic DVD much better than I remembered.Jane Fonda was and still is very good looking.The beginning was the best I've seen so clear and crisp.A must for any Jane Fonda fan.The movie itself was a little campy but over all a well done picture.Well worth the money.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I guess I will wait on the movie and hope it is better. At least it will be condensed into 90 minutes. The buzz about the book and movie finally got to me so I downloaded the sample. I couldn't even get through the sample so I deleted it. It was a boring mess. The subject matter in the first chapter not my thing. Nothing caught me and made me want to keep reading. I have limited time to read in the first place. I expect a book to hook me from the beginning, not drag on and on making me wonder why I am bothering in the first place.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Ultimate Matrix Collection on Blu-Ray is one of several shining examples on why one should upgrade to the beautiful high definition pictures blu-ray is capable of producing. These movies look fantastic on my Samsung 1080P television with Samsung Blu-Ray Player.<br /><br />This item is the ultimate collection containing all three movies in the Matrix Trilogy, the anime Matrix films, behind the scenes features as well as all the goodies that Blu-Ray has to offer.<br /><br />This item is a must for any blu-ray collection.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I watched the first movie with hesitation. I really didn't expect to like it but then it wasn't half bad. I thought, that was cute and lively. I ended up watching it twice. So, I watched this one, expecting the same and didn't get far into it before I realized it was not the same and I lost interest before the end of the movie. The storyline was wierd. There was too much stuff that just didn't make sense or totally incorrect. I just didn't get it. To be honest, by the end, I didn't care what happened. Of course I am an adult and a child might view it differently but my little girl wouldn't even watch past the opening so I guess it wasn't her thing either. And no, I am not a troll, just a mother that watches a lot of animated stuff.
0316212377|5.0|Well...Waited and waited for this book and I was not disappointed. The Hydrogen Sonata is an exciting and well written Culture Novel. A great heroine, steadfast Minds, and lots of great chase scenes make this another hit. The author has a real gift in making ordinary people into extraordinary characters. The only problem now is that I have to wait for another one to be published. More Culture, please!
0545101425|3.0|I waffled between giving this 3 or 4 stars. I initially leaned more towards 4, but the more I thought about this the more I realized that I was just a little underwhelmed by the climax of the trilogy. I'd be giving that extra star based more on my love for the previous books, which isn't entirely fair.<br /><br />Part of what I somewhat liked in this book was that some of the elements I was slowly starting to get tired of (everyone wanting in Katniss's pants or loving her, for example) were slightly addressed here. This is a slight spoiler, but at one point Peeta is brainwashed into hating Katniss and she essentially has to prove herself to him. Sorta. This is ultimately glossed over and never really dealt with in detail, nor is her relationship with Peeta or Gale. It's enough to where I'm mostly satisfied, but there's never really any in-depth plot building as far as the relationship and Katniss's choice goes. It just sort of \\"happens\\" and considering the amount of buildup there was to this point as far as the romances went, it fizzled instead of providing a bang. This was one of the elements that I both liked and disliked as far as the book went.<br /><br />What really grabs the reader are the moments when tragic deaths occur. Collins has a great way of bringing incredibly sad scenes across and these scenes are unarguably the strongest. It's when Collins has to wrap everything up and give us a happy ending that she seems to sort of go out with more of a whimper than a bang. As always, the themes in the books are fairly strong and will be a great discussion point for many. The excess of the Capitol and the destruction of war are brought in decently well and while they're not as well worked in as they were in the last two books, they're still decently done.<br /><br />It's just that this is such a let down after the strength of the previous two books. I like it well enough and the narrator does a decent job, but this just wasn't the strongest book in the series by a long shot. I can only hope that when they make the movie adaptation that they work on strengthening the book's plot and working on the romance and its resolution, because otherwise I'm not certain how they'll be able to get two movies out of it.long shot.

B005GRTNXC|4.0|Leona Lewis' third album \\"Glassheart\\" is what we've come to expect from her, for the most part. Soaring ballads showcasing her amazing yet devastated-sounding vocals. \\"Fireflies\\" starts off a tender piano ballad before percussion, strings and choir crash and sweep in with Leona reaching for some amazing notes near the end. Brilliant! \\"I To You\\" is a haunting ballad with heavy beats. Other nice ballads are \\"Favourite Scar\\", \\"When It Hurts\\", and \\"Fingerprint\\", but there are also some typical dull Leona ballads like \\"Un Love Me', Lovebird\\", and \\"Stop The Clocks\\" dragging things down a bit.<br /><br />If the album comprised just these songs, this would be another typically average Leona album. However, she steps out of her comfort zone on Lead-single \\"Trouble\\", a lovely meeting of Trip Hop strings, Hip Hop beats, and on the alternate version at the end, an excellent rap by Childish Gambino. The song is co-penned by Emile Sand&eacute;. \\"Come Alive\\" is laden with ghostly harmonies, moody electronica, and breakbeats. The Darkchild-produced \\"Shake You Up\\" shakes things up with a catchy Disco bridge. Title track \\"Glassheart\\" is House meets Dub-step. \\"My heart was beating, And so was yours, We threw each other, Down on the floor\\" she sings through the buzzing and juddering song and it works like a charm. More like these in the future Leona.
B008VBYN80|4.0|The game is addictive. Its fun but it costs money for good stuff. Even if you don't buy stuff its still ok.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I 'm addicted! it works really well with very few issues! much better than the knockoffs. I love that I can see the boards!
B008NABUU8|2.0|I did not experience any force closes on my Kindle fire yet as seen with other users but I did experience longer than expected load times. The graphics are high quality that could explain why it takes so much time to load each level. Once the game loads and starts to work the game play is okay and pretty much like [[ASIN:B004SPETQ4 X Construction]] and while I find X Construction little poorer on the graphics but better in the way it handles and love the game play and physics.<br /><br />The app does have 'OpenFeint' modules which is notorious for gathering personal information and integrated are full network accesses which keeps begging for Facebook likes, I find it irritating at times. The music can get boring but thankfully it can be turned off from the main menu. I wish the developer did not include 'OpenFeint' modules in the app. - Users beware!<br /><br />The best thing about this game is the beautiful background scenes and the ability to zoom into the construction site for better control. The physics and sound effects are cool.<br /><br />The game has potential but at this current state of the build I cannot rate it more than 2 stars. I will keep it in the cloud and if I find new updates wherein Openfeint gets removed and nagging screens gets minimized I will try later and update my review of this game.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it keeps the child busy when needed also fun to play when u r killing time love the game
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a a very fun game for all ages and very addictive! The only flaw is it drains your battery.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Very good story.  Fast moving and interesting.  Baldacci has been one of my favorite authors for years and this book was no disappointment.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|very much liked the way this progressed and ended, it was twisted enough as well as happy enough so that you weren't left unsettled
B009UQC7NS|5.0|Very entertaining! Kept me on the edge of my seat. Very action packed and it developed the characters further. I was thrilled again to not have commercials, I can't get over that fact. I'm very happy with the quality of the video provided by Amazon.

B008NABUU8|1.0|I do not like this game because its so slow and turns off my kindle!!! don't buy it it a money waster
B008NABUU8|5.0|this app is a good game and everyone should play it even people that are really into building legos and things out of wood

B008PE9GSA|3.0|ZZ Top are still best remembered for their flashy videos, that crazy car and buzzed out synths riding atop songs about legs and sharp dressed men. What most forget is that they started as a Texas blues and boogie outfit, making the most of their three piece line-up. That led to such great albums and songs like \\"Tush,\\" \\"Tejas\\" and \\"Fandango.\\" \\"La Futura\\" is a look back to that era, with producer Rick Rubin nudging Dusty Hill, Billy Gibbons and Frank Beard towards s stripped down electric blues, letting the trio wail away like it was 1974.<br /><br />That doesn't make \\"La Futura\\" a great album or a return to form, as they've been doing this music under the radar on discs like \\"Rhythmeen\\" and \\"Mescalaro,\\" just without the hype. The sound is still instantly recognizable with Gibbons and Hill trading lead vocals and Gibbons' snarly guitar licks sounding exclusive to him. The songs are also appropriately snappy, with the growl of \\"Gotsta Get Paid\\" and \\"Have A Little Mercy\\" again sounding like no band except ZZ Top. And finally taking the shackles off of Frank Beard may be the best thing about \\"La Futura,\\" as he can now freely whack his snare drums without worrying about a drum machine.<br /><br />I guess what bums me out here are two things; that the songs all sound recycled from other ZZ Top tunes, and that the album barely clocks in at a 40 mins for 10 songs. With almost a decade between discs and the hype of Rubin behind the boards (one of the few times Gibbons has shared the bench with any other than Bill Ham), I was expecting something more. Fans will enjoy this, non-fans will scratch their heads, while classic rock radio will Que up \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" for another spin.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wanted to read Fifty Shades to see what the big deal was. I think its fun, I don't think it is nearly as erotic as everyone talked about but it is entertaining and brings me back to a time of young love, when a girl does anything to not lose her guy.
B008OJ291W|2.0|I don't know which makes me feel worse; that Jeff Lynne decided he needed to do note-for-note recreations of some of ELO's best known songs or that I was sucker enough to drop my hard earned cash on this doggy-doo. I first heard that Lynne wanted to make \\"Mr Blue Sky\\" because he wanted to make the songs sound like they did in his head, and with modern technology. OKAY, I'm intrigued. My imagination gets an expectation that maybe Lynne's going to revisit these songs and do some major overhauls, like different orchestrations of arrangements. Silly me.<br /><br />Like Kiss, Foreigner, Journey and a handful of other classic rock bands, Lynne pulls a George Lucas on us and decides the real thing would be so much cooler if he just made them a second time, without any help from the rest of those pesky original Electric Light Orchestra bandmates. Which should give everyone a terrific lesson in what is commonly referred to as \\"Band Chemistry.\\" As technically proficient as he is, and as much as he was the driving force behind ELO's multiple line-ups (except for the awful ELO II from the late 80's/early 90's), he alone does not an ELO make.<br /><br />So you end up with some various minor changes, like the much dryer version of \\"Do Ya\\" or the less disco-fied version of \\"Turning to Stone.\\" For the most part though, this is like chocolate pudding when you could have chocolate mousse. They have some similarities, but they just aren't the same thing. Jeff Lynne has every right in the world to remake his own songs in whatever format he desires. I also have the right to call them doody. Don't make the same mistake I did. Stick to your copies of [[ASIN:B0009YNSJW All Over the World: The Very Best of Electric Light Orchestra (Original Recording Remastered)]]. Key word here? Original.

B0060D0Z0G|5.0|this is a very good movie.  Incredible story.  John Malkovich is perfect. a little bit of history.  Men of the '70s ugh..
B008220DGE|5.0|I believe The Master is possibly Paul Thomas Anderson's best film; and it is definitely tied for me with \\"There Will Be Blood\\".  That said; many people are critiquing it on the basis of having a \\"meandering plot\\" or a story that goes nowhere.  I think these people are looking at it the same way someone might be looking at atonal music for a Romantic, soaring anthem.  Good luck finding it.  The Master is a different form of filmmaking to be sure.<br /><br />It is a much more abstract film than anything Anderson has done and more complex.  The film relies on subtext that is buried under the characters rather than an intense plot.  The intensity, instead, is transferred to the characters, the cinematography, and the texture of the music.  If you find Freddie Quell and Lancaster Dodd compelling; if you wonder about their similarities throughout the film and what makes them different, what pushes and pull them then you will be eating up every frame of this film.  The film doesn't give easy answers or resolutions.  By the end you are left with open-ended questions: what did Freddie get from Dodd; what did Freddie learn and is Dodd truly a master or is he as broken as Freddie?  There are so many interpretations and impressions.<br /><br />The film's music and cinematography is, again, a character onto itself; it is crisp, well-framed and bold.  The juxtaposition of the clean, precise and somewhat detached camerawork, the color and sumptuous design of the sets, the smoothness of the editing and the larger-than-life performances of Phoenix and Hoffman are truly awe-inspiring.  One gets an impression that fire has been captured as they strut and gesticulate about in Anderson's framework.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite thing about Paul Thomas Anderson films is that the answers may appear hidden but often everything is in plain view: Daniel Plainview in \\"There Will Be Blood\\", for instance, in one scene reveals his mistrust of humanity and his misanthropic nature.  Freddie Quell, concurrently, in one scene tells Lancaster Dodd he killed people in the war; in the beginning of the film we know he has PTSD from combat, and he goes on to tell Dodd he may or may not have slept with his aunt.  I believe war and incest may be enough for someone to try and bury their past in a torrent of alcohol as he does, yet I hear so many reviewers complain that the film-making was not direct enough or did not reveal enough about him.<br /><br />I don't see a failure there; I see a divergence of taste.  To me, personally, it's far more compelling to see hints of a character's past but not totally reveal him.  Why turn the lights all the way up; why reveal everything?  There is something to be said of mystery.<br /><br />It's a disservice to us and the nature of this universe to think there's a written law to everything that makes the human heart the way it is.<br /><br />If not.  Then there's always The Hunger Games.
B008X9Z37A|1.0|Very cheaply made. Not worth the $20.00 plus shipping and handling.<br />I have another Kindle Fire that needs a case and I will not buy the same one.<br />I really expected something that would look nice with my Kindle Fire.
B008NABUU8|3.0|it downloaded really slowly the controlled are ok but it forces itself close sometimes its a good timewaster but I think after a while you will get bored but my little little sister loves it and its free now so whatever you should at least try it and if you don't like it so what just remove it tron your divise and put a 1-5 star reveiw but really!?!? you don't have to trash talk I mean its just showing how immature you really are -.-

B009L32R5I|5.0|Thank you, Steve for this artistic undertaking.  What an amazing album.  The versions are very true to the original studio recordings but they are also updated in many ways, with string arrangements instead of mellotron, obviously digital instead of analog recording so the sound spectrum capture is fantastic and there is also some extra music, (like the acoustic intro extras for Blood On the Rooftops and 32 Doors).  The vocals are really well done (with several vocalists), so well that I don't miss Peter and Phil's singing like I might think I would.  He captured the spirit of those original versions but at the same time embellished them so well that the results are nothing short of spectacular.  The version of Supper's Ready is definitely one for the ages, it really soars;  the last couple of sections are riveting.  Can Utility and the Coastliners also is a standout, for me.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I am 40% through with this book and so far I am struggling to get through it.  The good news is if you love John Corey's wit and dry humor, as I do, he's back!  The bad news is I am still slugging through learning about Yemen's history, culture, and politics.  I feel like I'm still waiting for the real story to start and the book is almost half over!  I either love Nelson Demille's books or I hate them and I think this one falls into the latter category, unfortunately.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just finished the book and it got good around 80%.  I just don't care for DeMille's books that take place in foreign countries.  This book reminded me of Up Country in that there is so much history and background about the country it's more like you're studying for an exam than pleasure reading.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Such a great album. I listen to it on continuous repeat and am still loving it.  I will buy whatever they produce from this day on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The story was amazing how it all came together.  I appreciated the character development and the understanding of their personalities, coping mechanisms, and relationship.  Very sexy and romantic as well!
B00701L5XS|2.0|I love the app but it doesn't work with Android 4. With an update I might give it a 4 or 5.
B008LSVLVA|5.0|Being a fairly new fan of Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson, I was not familiar with any of this material when the DVD came out.  Since then, I've watched it a couple times, and listened to the CD version at least a dozen times.<br /><br />This is a richly layered work.  It not only encourages repeated listening, it pretty much demands it.  It also rewards it immensely.  This package gets my highest recommendation.  A bargain at twice the price.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game to keep the mind active!  Love that you can complete the flows fairly quickly (usually) if you don't have a ton of time to play.  I play during timeouts, and at halftime of my son's games.  THANK YOU!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie first so I was hesitant to read the book! Between the visuals portrayed by the writing and the memories I have from the movie, the book really came alive.  What a great combination to an incredible story.  I had trouble putting this book down and couldn't wait to get home from work to pick it back up!!  Read one book this year, this is it!!
1938469003|3.0|If you're interested in the british origins of IPA, you might love this book.  A huge portion of the book is dedicated to history.  While the recent American history (from 1960s to present) was very interesting, the older British history was pretty dry for me.  What I was really hoping for was the end-all technical book on how to brew the perfect IPA.  The technical portion of the book is surprisingly short and I haven't learned a lot i didn't already know (keep in mind that I have already read a lot about brewing hoppy beers.)  I also feel that some of the information is vague.  He doesn't say \\"do exactly this and your IPA will improve.\\"  Also, the recipes are a little tricky to follow, with some not clearly stating hop amounts.  So, if you're looking for technical how-to, you might be a little disappointed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am not normally a fan of trilogies but this one so far is fantastic.  As a Kindle owner I get to \\"borrow\\" them for free but I am limited to one a month.....I'm dying trying to wait for 1 Nov to download the last one. The movie was fantastic and the books are as good or better. Huge twists in this book...I didn't see them coming and they were great...shoul dsetup the last book nicely!  I highly recommned this book.  Would give it 5 stars but the first book was just a little better.
B005FISBTO|1.0|Great season, ruined by an unskippable ad at the beginning of every disc which reveals the ending by showing the very last shot of the whole season. Seriously, whose idea was it to force people to watch a spoiler of the very show they've just bought and are about to watch? And they wonder why people turn to bit torrent and illegal downloads instead. You do the right thing and pay for the DVDs and they screw you. Nice. One star because I can't give none. (5 stars for the season itself, but really, watch it online instead.)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is amazing. Robert Downey jr is the best superhero actor ever. All the actors fit their character. Great story line.

B006Z7Z3S6|5.0|Let me first just qualify this review by saying I'm not new to the horror genre; I have a huge collection and I've seen just about everything.<br /><br />I would like to write a thorough review of this film but lack the time. Instead I would like to counter the negative reviews with a few details about The Innkeepers:<br /><br />It is by director Ti West, who made the superior House Of The Devil, that not only feels like it was actually made in 1982, but accomplishes tremendous things with suspense and atmosphere. I consider it a new classic.<br /><br />The Innkeepers is nothing like House Of The Devil. This is far from saying it is a failure; it couldn't be farther from it. Rather, it shows unexpected versatility from a director who is not going to do the same thing twice.<br /><br />The Innkeepers displays a remarkable degree of control by the director, in which he begins the film with a hum of suspense set so low you barely even know it's there, and very gradually inches it up until by the end it is an astonishing, blood-curdling roar.<br /><br />The Innkeepers is funny, its characters not just likable but in fact endearing. I can understand if this confuses some viewers, because this is the most common failing of the horror genre. The two main characters - The Innkeepers of a failing old, possibly haunted hotel in question - are wonderfully written and play their roles as dorks with no career ambitions to perfection. The secondary characters are also excellent.<br /><br />If your expectation of a horror movie is that it should go for the throat in the first 30 seconds, that characterization is dispensable, suspense is meaningless and other things such as comedy don't belong, and the only point of a horror movie is to watch people get tortured --- no, The Innkeepers is not your movie.<br /><br />If however you love an original film that values its characters, has a great sense of humor, teases with atmosphere and bits of suspense, and finishes with a fine, Shining-esque shock, I think you will be glad you saw The Innkeepers. Huge props to Ti West for having the guts to make a film that's not all about guts. Looking forward to seeing what he does next.
B005NNVUBM|5.0|On Pink Floyd's journey from the tragically short Syd Barrett era to Dark Side of the Moon Ummagumma gives a looking-back/looking-forward vibe. In particular, Syd's replacement, David Gilmour gets his chance to shine. His playing on the live disc, of necessity, frequently references Syd Barrett's improvisational, atmospheric guitar style while presenting his own more meticulously constructed solos in the same song(s). In the studio he reveals a subtlety and delicacy on acoustic guitar that made a credible case for a thriving post-Barrett Floyd. Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Nick Mason are also given space to express themselves, and all do so with great creativity. On Sisysphis, Wright's contribution, the mighty Mellotron(making its third-to-last appearance on a PF album - the last two being cameos on Atom Heart Mother suite and Meddle's Echoes)shares aural space with a flushing toilet and some avant-impressionist piano themes. Waters' Grantchester Meadows provides some pastoral folk reflectons. Mason's The Grand Vizier's Garden Party is the weak link, but the flute(might be 'Tron) figures are pretty even though the centerpiece seems to be a fairly pedestrian drum solo before reverting back to the flutes. Gilmour's The Narrow Way is the studio album's masterpiece. Delicate finger-style acoustic picking which seems to breathe is punctuated by electric slide guitar accents before it morphs into the sort of four-on-the-floor slow rocker,forshadowing musical and rhythmic themes that became more prominant on Atom Heart Mother(suite), Meddle(Echoes), Dark Side of the Moon(Time) and Wish You Were Here(Have a Cigar). Historically this album has the distinction of clearly NOT being pervaded by the \\"ghost\\" of Syd Barrett while equally clearly NOT being the commercially/artistically successful DSOM Floyd. Personally it is the first Floyd LP I ever bought back in 1969, and as such occupies a special place in my heart which explains the fourth and fifth stars in my rating. I've seen one- and two-star reviews for this album and while I understand peoples' bewilderment with its apparent lack of direction, I guess I hold it in higher esteem for sentimental reasons. That said, I picked up \\"A Nice Pair\\" when that one came out and became obsessed with Syd Barrett, both in and out of Pink Floyd and often meditate on what might have been had he been able to balance his hallucinagenic indulgences with a more disciplined creativity, either staying in the band or forging a successful solo career. How about if he & Gilmour could have continued as dual guitarists and writers as they (sort of) did on Saucerful of Secrets? In another time-space continuum maybe...e seen one- and two-star reviews for this album and while I understand peoples' bewilderment with its apparent lack of direction, I guess I hold it in higher esteem for sentimental reasons.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The reason I gave it only three stars is because of the ending. It leaves you hanging...which probably is the purpose of the author. I guess I like books that tie things up at the end. The author did do a brilliant job with the main chatacter, Amy. Amy was so smart, resourceful, conniving character who thought of everything for her perfect \\"crimes.\\" I certainly wouldn't want to cross her in any way. The book is a page turner at times.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I am a videogames and films collector ...and this is a very very good limited edition ....the zombie head is amazing ,it's like a real cadaveric head in putrefaction .... great limited :)
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Me parece una pelicula de terror que realmente cumple con ese calificativo, deja una sensacion de temor al final.<br />Seguirla con atencion
B000HIVQK8|5.0|The perfect messages for humanity from a man who lived his life seeking and being connected to the source...light, love, and<br />who showed us just how it is done...with such grace.
034580404X|5.0|I am only halfway thru the second book but I find it more than just housewife' porn' as some have coined it. Not that it isnt steamy but it is actaully a very good romance with a bit of suspense. I would strongly recomend this series.
0553293397|5.0|Asimov matches Agatha Christie in writing mystery.  Combine that with science fiction and you get a superb novel like The Naked Sun.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I got this movie very quickly and in good condition. I love this movie. It is a nice addition to our Christmas movies.<br />Thank You!
0345536886|5.0|Not only is the story very good but also very entertaining -- some of the dialogue is genius and just plain hilarious.  IN that way, it's similar to The King of Torts.  I also thought a more approapriate title would have been The Street Lawyers, but Grisham already has a novel by that name :-).
B000FC1LOC|4.0|Really liked this book. Very surprising ending. I will definitely recommend this book to others. It will make you hug your children a little tighter. However, I could have done without the cheesey sex scenes and language that didn't fit with the story line.  Some people didn't like the ending but I did. Seems like the best way for Sarah to realize what she did. Also, no doctor would ok 30 CT scans. That is entirely too much radiation! Another unlikely scenario is the living arrangement for Anna at the fire department.
0385343248|5.0|A majestic novel, the type that you hope will never end.  IMO the best historical fiction ever written and one of the best novels period.
B004LROUNG|3.0|You'll learn a lot about suing a multimillion dollar company..but the characters and story were not as detailed.  I thought it could have had much more humor also.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this app.  I have finished all of the available puzzles and I can't wait until the next update!
B004GYY714|5.0|How nice to be able to take my music with me on vacation and be able to pick and choose what I want to listen to
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game. It is very simple yet addicting. I find myself playing it first thing in the morning and after work. Not much thought needs to go into it which is why I like it so much.
B008VBYN80|4.0|good game no bugs the one thing I don't like about the game is that theenergy runs out fast but not super fast
B008XG1X18|5.0|lots of great ideas!  I have used and enjoyed many projects, recipes, &amp; new ideas!  I recommend this app to many.
B00136JS12|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already... This is a great album that stands the test of time. It brings back great memories for sure! I bought it digitally and only paid 5.00. That made the decision a no brainer! Just buy it!!!
B004UHSB5A|2.0|I am giving up on this game. The domino placement is too frustrating. There is no help menu to give you a way to get the domino to stick and nothing to help you figure out scoring. As soon as I leave this, I am deleting it. Hope it makes a rebound with a better format and help.
B000EHQTZO|4.0|There has never been a remake of the 1933 King Kong movie that compares to the original version.  This digitally reworked version has kept the accuracy of the original movie with added clarity of the picture.  For any true \\"Classic Movie Buff\\" this movie will not disappoint you.
B0045EA1P6|5.0|I was not disappointed with this at all. I bought Some Nights and like it so decided to buy this one and I'm glad I did.
B008YRVW0I|1.0|I truly enjoyed this game, as I have it on my laptop.  However on the Kindle, it only allows you to get to a certain level.  You are not allowed to progress, as the application goes repeatedly to start then to buy screen.  I tried redownloading, ssdd!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down. I wanted to see what would happend and what there was to learn from this book.  This book is such a delight and keeps you turning the pages.  There are values to be learned along with the lessons that each of them go through and learn.  This book is just like all the Albom books, values, morals, thought provoking, easy reading and special! Loved this book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I've. only been playing for a couple of days, and no complaints so far. The meat and potatoes of the game is your basic hidden object game with a mysterious story attached. Has a definite Zynga feelnto it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I just love this game!!! I can't stay off of it and then I just have to buy coins so that I can keep playing!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|It is fun for kids and maybe grown ups<br />It is fun to group the coins and watch them fall
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writer breaks into what is usually a taboo subject for so many. Exciting and very candid look into what an abused child looks like in a grown man who chooses abuse as a coping mechanism to satiate his sexual gratification and emotional outrage. Amazing story that allows us to explore all that we are and all that we hope to be in the sexual world. If you are not a sexual deviant, you are sure to try your hand at it once you've read this novel.<br /><br />While this is a love story, is also about the power of motherhood, abuse, and how people tend to intertwine sexual gratification with the need for control of something so private in their life. Sustaining control is on the outside, as well as, on the inside for this character.<br /><br />What allows the reader to hold on and keep reading further is the drama, the wealth and intrigue of this man and where it will all lead.<br /><br />The fantasy just kept going and going and I wish it hadn't ended!
0307591549|4.0|The true value of this book is in communicating the underlying premise.  It adds to that by outlining some examples and stories that give the reader time to ruminate on the premise in several settings as well. It is well worth the price in dollars and time. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the examples are almost all from the financial industry.  It would be nice to draw on a broader base of experience.<br /><br />There are some solid steps outlined that will get you going in the right direction and keep you taking action until a positive/ balanced mindset becomes habit. Once you get to that point though the fun really begins.<br /><br />I've read this a couple of times, will keep a copy for myself and have handed out a few as well.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B008WCP2PG|3.0|I received my DVD version of \\"Magic Mike\\" today from Amazon.com. It does not contain the additional footage (dance sequences by Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer.) I was told today by someone that only the Blue Ray combo pac version has this.  THIS IS NOT CLEAR IN ANY OF THE PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS PUT OUT BY AMAZON.COM.  Shame on you Amazon, for deliberately misleading the public. Since I saw the film, I would not have purchased this DVD, but wanted to see the dance footage that Soderberg did not include in the film. I don't own a BLU RAY DVD player, by the way and can't afford one. I'm certainly disappointed that the Distribution Company distributed this product in this way.

B009KKLQVS|3.0|There has been some talk about what the songs on this dvd will be.  Well, here is the track listing!  I have said it on Facebook, and I will say it here,  The fans of The Beach Boys have been begging for a complete concert dvd.  This is only 21 songs of the 50 song set during the tour.  It seems that nobody in the band is reading our posts here on Amazon, or Facebook.  As for the quality of the dvd/BD release,I will edit the review when the dvd is available.<br />1.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|If your looking for something similar to 50 Shades, the crossfire novels should satisfy you. I will be purchasing the next book in the trilogy as well.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It is really difficult to find a good fantasy book nowadays as they tend to be not very original or deep speaking about the plot. The Name of the Wind is though a really great book. I liked this book so much that even decided to sacrifice the significant part of my sleep time to finish this book to the end.<br />The main thing in this book which makes it very strong is the down-to-earth plot not only presenting the romantic aspects of hero's life, but also showing the possible dark side of each decision or action. It is also usually very difficult to foresee the events in this book, which creates the image of real unpredictable life and could be seen as totally different approach to veni-vidi-vici approach used in many other fantasy books. This creates the balanced view and allows us to feel the life of main protagonist as the life of real person.
B008NABUU8|1.0|this game is no good. all it does is freeze up my kindle. THIS THING IS NO GOOD AT ALL.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|One of the best albums I have ever heard, not a single track on there that is poor or doesn't fit in. I have seen so many people bitching about the fact that there are several slower songs on the album, if they want to let them, they're missing out on some truly great songs. People were like that when they heard Hesitate from the Audio Secrecy album, another fantastic song. This is the music the band wants to make, if they wanted to release your standard album with 11 heavy songs that all sound the same then they would, but they don't, and that is what is great about this band. They don't just release the same sounding stuff all the time, there is something on this album and all the others that fit every mood you could think of.<br /><br />House of Gold and Bones is worth buying, I can't wait for part 2 next year.
B005XT10YS|5.0|I found this film to be absolutely exquisite! Robert Redford couldn't have done a better job putting this film together. The casting, writing and character analysis and development were right on the mark with this project. Bravo and a job well done Mr. Redford!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Considering you can get this set for under $10 (I know the price here changes by the hour, but at the time of writing this review it was $8.84), it is a great starter set.  It has a lot of animals, but I only wish more were not the same as those included in My First Zoo (there is only one animal that is unique to them).  The animals in this set are not nearly as exciting for my son as the farm animals, but they still add something nice to his collection.  I really like the \\"grass\\" brick, which is not too common.  While the set doesn't have too many actual bricks for building, it has a little of everything so it really is a good overall value (at least at the price I paid).
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Enjoyed the movie - well done action from start to finish.  Plenty of one-liners, which added a lot of laughs.  Watched it twice, and enjoyed it both times!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Great character driven story. Huge cast of characters and you'll know them better than your own family and neighbors by the end. Wish Barry didn't have to die. He may have been the only decent kind and selfless person in town.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This Kindle Fire application downloads really fast and allows you to organize your video or audio downloads as well! I have tried other YouTube download applications and they were either very slow or needed constant updates. This one is the best by far.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|I was really excited about this movie but was disappointed when it arrived and there was no digital copy included.  The digital copy was what I had thought I had ordered.  Other than that I was pleased with what I received.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|When I first listened to this disc, initially I had a mixed reaction to it.  Once I gave it a second listen, then came a third listen, 4th and so on.  In other words it has not been replaced in my 5 disc changer.  I love this CD.  The only song that didn't exactly move me was \\"Ghetto\\".  To me it felt misplaced on this CD,  I would've preferred another song in it's place. But what I liked about this CD is the fact that is flows so nicely that you can just let it play and not even notice that it's on. You just find yourself bobbing your head to the music and pushing the replay button because you just can't get enough of it. My favorite tracks are Miss Marlene, Planet D'Rhonda, It's not the same without you and Slinky thing.  The other selections are good but those tracks stick out.  Can't wait until the next Donald Fagen CD or Steely Dan. This is a much better CD than Morph the Cat.  I rate this one with Gaucho and Nightfly.  I highly recommend this CD.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is such an emotion-evoking book.  For anyone who has ever bullied someone or been the victim of bullies, this is for you to read.  I am not sure if it is considered a children's book, young adult, or adult.  It would be fitting for all, with a warning for children who are very sensitive.  The story line is so touching; I loved reading this book!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As the last book of the trilogy it has been really good so far. Amazon was great and had no problems with getting the book through my kindle.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book has my favorite ending for a book. This is my favorite book out of the series and I can't wait for the next.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Jonasson's story made me laugh or smile on almost every page.  \\"The 100-Year-Old-Man...\\" is well-written fun but also historically well-researched.  Its tone is matter-of-fact but its story is absurdly rollicking.  Modern day mahem cleverly intertwined with twisted history.  Read it with joy especially if you're a little tired of books making you tense or teary.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is very easy to read and the spoken  word is nice and clear. I love the product and the price: Free. it's a blessing in the sky!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Pretty neat game.  If you drop enough coins you can play for a long time without having to \\"buy\\" more coins.  Good game to keep you entertained when waiting for whatever you're waiting for.
B0086QS7N2|5.0|Clockwork angels is a really good album for a real rush fan.  I especially like Caravan, The wreckers and Carnies.  I am going to the tour soon and cant wait to it live. Of course Rush always puts on an amazing show.  They must think highly of the album cos they play a lot of it along with some old stuff they havent done in awhile.  this album is a must have for the rush fans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the ultimate authority on life. How could it have less than 5 stars?  I enjoy the YouVersion because you can choose your favorite version or read a passage in several different versions. It is easily searchable for conducting studies. And most importantly, it is on my phone so that I have access anytime I wish.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card is a science fiction novel about a young boy that is chosen to join the military in outer space. Card is a very descriptive writer and describes the scenes and mood of the book with an intensity that you can feel throughout the book. The only thing that I don't like about his writing style is how serious he can be. There are parts in the book where he can joke around with the characters, but throughout most of the book the mood is somber and not as appealing. Throughout the story Card finds a way to snag you through slight foreshadowing that makes the book impossible to put down. He finds a hook and reels you in without warning, not letting you back out until you finish the book. The book is written in first person and describes the emotions and thoughts of Ender (the main character) in great detail, without boring the reader.<br /><br />In Ender's Game, the setting is almost completely in a space port orbiting the Earth. The gravity is created through centrifugal force, and the floors curve upward. This creates a very different setting than here on Earth, where the horizon is curving downward. The main character, Ender, is a young boy from six years old to ten throughout the book, and is a brilliant young child. He is drafted into the military at such a young age to fight the buggers, an alien race that threatens humanity. During his time in the space station, Ender learns more and more about how people work, and how to defeat the buggers. He moves up the ranks too quickly for it to be normal, causing jealousy to come from the other students. He has a hard time making friends during his time there, but finds those that matter most to him.<br /><br />In the end, the struggle of the book is between Ender and his conscience, forcing him to choose between himself and the rest of the world.  This is a difficult choice for Ender because he doesn't like being the middleman, he enjoys being the leader and knowing his enemies. The main conflict in this book is not between the buggers and Ender as the story would have you believe, but between the different personalities within Ender. His need to dominate versus his need to be of the people. This is why I believe that this is a very good book. It starts out slowly with a simple story that grows and grows to encompass the whole world. It leads to a fantastic ending that no one expected.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A little repetitive. Not just with the sex. I felt like this book and the first could easily have been one.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Could not stop playing for hours. Eventually I had to because my vision was blurry, Lol. Great story line. it is worth the two dollars.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This is a very good movie!! My kids love this movie!!! My husband even watched this with us and he is not into the kids movies!!! I give this 5 stars!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series was amazing! I couldn't put it down once I started reading it! I have shared this book with several people and they also love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game and tons of fun its super addicting I love getting the prizes and earning all the different bonus coins!
B0063IH60K|5.0|play over and over. The app has no problems, play is smooth and easy. So glad I down loaded this app!
B004NSURT4|3.0|The story of 2 intelligent agencies trying to confuse each other ended up confusing me. Maybe I am not just up to the intrique and counter intrique but I prefer a more straight forward plot. The ending was unsatisfactory and all in all I did not like the book
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is really fun, but it is way to east. Make the up comming updare a little bit harder abd it will be ten times better.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I bought Bared to You and Reflected in You (parts 1 & 2 of the Crossfire series), because of a comment I saw on a Fifty Shades site. People were comparing the two authors/books/styles and drawing negative comparisons. I wanted to see for myself. I obviously liked book 1 or I wouldn't have bought part 2.<br />The two stories are similar (mega rich, hot male and a young girl, lots of sex) but both authors have different styles and they aren't copies of each other. You need to read Fifty Shades and the Crossfire novels seperately and enjoy them both. Sylvia Day is a great author and I hope she receives as much hype for Crossfire as EL James has, as both series deserve it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|great app works very well on kindle fire. very easy yo use and easy to update. keep the apps coming.
B00846REIS|5.0|Gideon and Eva make for a wonderful combination of lust, love and screwedupness. This story is its own and should stop being compared to Fifty!
B00008WT5J|5.0|I put it on it sounded great I rocked my brains out then it was done so I did it again. Now stop bothering me, I'm trying to listen again.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Anita reminds us that we are love.  When we remember that we are truly magnificent beings  and we no longer need to do but we need to be, then all will be well<br /><br />Share<br />...
B000HL09MG|2.0|I felt like this was a movie I \\"should\\" watch so I could be in-the-know with everyone who talks about it. Because I was about 10 years old when it came out, I obviously wasn't allowed to watch it at the time. Anyway, I thought it was really boring and weird. It wasn't what I was expecting at all. I didn't mind the sex/nudity, just the plot was really strange. I don't know, I can't describe it. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. :/
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Wes Anderson's films are not for everyone, but I've always enjoyed them and own three of his earlier films. Moonrise Kingdom is the first that will definitely make my list of 100 or so favorite films. It manages to be sentimental without being sappy, nostalgic without being softhearted.<br /><br />Note on digital copy: following the instructions included with the disc make it seem like you have to sign up for UltraViolet in order to access your iTunes digital copy. You don't. Just enter the authorization code directly into the Redeem window in iTunes and it will start downloading the digital versions (SD + HD + iTunes Extras).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed it very much. Some unexpected suspense and mystery. Left me wanting to find out more-waiting for next book.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Good light read for a Kindle. I read this while in the hospital.Did not require deep thinking or concentration.Not worth (9.99).
B0044DEAUA|5.0|very very nice priduct, very usefull, works well. with the magnetic clip, but it is impossible to answer a call if You are outside the car and if your mobile phone and device are in a reachable area You can just answer a call from  your phone and then to switch your phone loud speaker but you can't return to the hand mode. anyway it is nice
B004R1Q296|5.0|I love this book.  I bought this version just have it with me whenever I wanted to read it.  If you're interested in medieval Europe this is a great introduction.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a great game because it challenges your mind.  I have several different versions of this game and the Kindle version is the best.
B00199B2Z8|5.0|PROS:<br /><br />- Each chapter is an article that takes 5-10 minutes to read. Since each chapter is self-contained, you can put read the book in small doses, if necessary, and not lose continuity.<br /><br />- Humor is abundant - his insight into American culture is superb, and he also lets you see a bit about British culture too.<br /><br />CON:<br /><br />- It's starting to get somewhat dated as time goes on, but 90% of the book is certainly applicable today.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Whether you're an American or not, read a sample of the book. If you like what you see, you'll probably love the whole book. Bill Bryson is the author who has influenced my writing style more than any other. This book illustrates what's great about his writing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I hesitated to read this book because I figured it was a topic worthy of a long magazine article rather than an entire book, especially a really big book. I was wrong. It is a very good read and I am glad I listened to all the people who told me to read it. Go for it!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|And exactlly what it says it is in the description - would get again and will probably will get pro version.
B005ZMTYTQ|3.0|This movie was a good telling of a story.  It had a good pace about it; not too fast or too slow.  Some characters could have been built up a little more in substance/background.  A few parts were juvenile and since it didn't take itself too seriously that was ok to.
B003T70EWA|5.0|What a great spectrum of musical styles played by incredible guitarists and other stellar supporting musicians. For me, I can listen to it over and over and find new jewels everytime. Supporting Rit's collective masterpiece was easy to do based on his prior work and legacy. But that aside, this musical body of work is a must for not only any guitar player, but music lovers in general. Great vocals to boot. A perfect learning gift for any young guitar player who will understand the full spectrum of what it means to be a guitar player. Bravo Lee... simply magnificent.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|Although Mr Rushdie doesn't take us into the magical realms of fiction, he uses his talents to make the reading of a biography as engaging as anything he has written before. Every paragraph, as usual, is mesmerizing and draws you into Joseph Anton's isolated world. You live it along with him rather than being told fact after fact. A brilliant way to approach himself - in the third person.<br /><br />His struggle then is still, if not more, relevant today as we continue to clash over ideas and freedom of speech. Worth the read to understand what the Satanic Verses has come to represent in our modern, free world.
B00786XVOG|4.0|Having just seen Yanni live at the Santa Barbara bowl in July 2012, I was eager to see how the recent El Morro DVD from December 2012 compared. The selections performed were mostly the same. But even so, my wife and I enjoyed this live DVD immensely, much more so than either the Tribute (Taj Mahal) or Acropolis DVDs. They are much older with standard 4:3 picture and sound to match. This one is 16:9 with good quality video and very good sound (see below), especially considering the weather conditions.<br /><br />The audio mix is as good as any I have heard before, even the LIVE blu-ray. But isn't that sound quality a little TOO good? It sounds a lot like a 'studio' recording to me. The rarity of shots of musician's finger action on their instruments, combined with the out-of-sync A-V shots that WERE visible, makes the sound mix rather suspect. The clincher is the vocal chorus(!) on Ode to Humanity; was that the audience singing along?? I don't think so! Taped? Overdubbed? Punch-ins? I hope not, but I don't have any other explaination that fits.<br /><br />Only 11 selections from the concert are on this DVD. Perhaps that's all they were able to get on tape due to the poor weather and the resulting single interrupted performance.<br /><br />I wish that Yanni would draw from his many, many past compositions and produce concert disks with only \\"not-on-concert-disc-before\\" selections. Although this DVD has less repeats than usual, there are still a few that are already on previous concert discs.<br /><br />The Puerto Rico \\"Special\\" is really a travel promo.  It isn't too bad, at least it is short and heartfelt. He's been coming there for leisure for 25 years!? But there are just too many glamour shots of El Morro and golf courses, and not enough of the island's other attractions. (does he play golf??)<br /><br />These are mostly minor quibbles. This DVD is highly recommended above the other Yanni DVDs except the blu-ray version of Yanni-Live (Las Vegas). And it looks likeyou will soon (Nov. 2012) be able to get this DVD in blu-ray too.

B000XUBC5E|5.0|WOW! What a book! Very good! Suspensful to the end, loved it and would definitely recommend to others! Now I want to read more from this author!
0451228731|5.0|After finishing the currently released books in the Song of Ice and Fire saga I was after something completely different.  So when a friend of mine said I should try Daemon I was not disappointed.  Daemon fully captured me from the first page.  As a Linux guy that has played many MMO's and games like WOW & Counter Strike I guess this was an easy grab for me.  As the story developed it became more than a apparent that I was hooked, getting fully involved with the thriller and its characters.  In the end I had digested this in a mater of days because I could not put it down.  One of the best stories I have the please of reading.  Fantastic work Suarez!!!
B005GFPZYK|1.0|I found this book to be very poorly written. The author should have considered getting professional help in writing the book. The book is poorly written and has no substance.  My recommendation is ...... take a match to it to start a nice Texas BBQ ... the author would appreciate that being from Texas. There are much better books out there for people to read, don't waste your time and money on this one. Best regards, Jorge.
B000003TAW|5.0|I first heard Weezer when I was an 6th grader and I am such a \\"goodie 2 shoes\\" that the punk boys in the Weezer shirts could hardly believe I knew the band.  My favorite song on this album is Only in Dreams.<br />By far their best album to date.
B0058YPGVQ|5.0|This is not only the best series going but the best series I have ever watched period. The story line and cast make it so that u feel involved with whatever is going on and when u are done with one show its almost impossible to not watch the next one (which is why I wait to buy the blu rays)
B008XNZMOU|3.0|This will not be a sugar coated review.  I am stunned that when I first purchased Taylor, like the good ol' Tim McGraw Taylor, she has turned into this.  P.S. This album is pop.  I have never really, really liked her.  She is nice and puts on an ok show (I saw her about 5-6 years ago) but she really can't sing spectacular and  I mostly buy the albums to see what story she is telling now...<br /><br />1) State of Grace= Pop<br />2) Red= Pop<br />3) Treacherous= More Country<br />4) I Knew You Were Trouble= Pop (Maybe even a country girls version of a lil' rappin)<br />5) All Too Well= More Country<br />6) 22= Pop, though I do like this song<br />7) I Almost Do= Country<br />8) We Are Never Getting Back Together= Pop<br />9) Stay Stay Stay= Pop- though, again, I did like it.  (references a football helmet which is funny)<br />10) The Last Time= Not Pop, Not Country<br />11) Holy Ground= Pop, or something like that.<br />12) Sad Beautiful Tragic= Country<br />13) The Lucky One= Pop- and I really like the style & lyric of this song<br />14) Everything Has Changed= More Country<br />15) Starlight= More Country<br />16) Begin Again= Country (one on radio sounds edited versus this country one) (and I like this version better)<br /><br />BONUS DISC (Target Exclusive)<br />17) The Moment I Knew= Country<br />18) Come Back... Be Here= Country - pretty good song<br />19) Girl at Home= Country<br />20) Treachersous (original demo)=n/a<br />21) Red (original demo)=n/a<br />22) State of Grace (acoustic)=n/a<br /><br />I guess if you cannot evolve as an artist that kind of means you are stuck in a rut, but I just wasn't prepared for the amount of pop music there is on this RED album.  She actually has \\"featured\\" artists, which is kind of different.  I used to like her country songs that ended up being crossovers, but this is just one girls opinion.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Easy to read and great descriptions! Seems to be following the movie so far.  Looking forward to reading all three books!

B006LG74R4|5.0|The funniest movie I have seen in years. Even better that the original Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson is brilliant. Unfortunately the best scene of the movie was relegated to the credits.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I have to say that I was completely blown away by this movie. I was recommended this film by a friend, without any idea what the film would be about. I saw the trailer online and assumed it would be another all-flash and no substance anime, but what I received was a beautiful and action packed tale of a family banding together in a time of great crisis. Most anime tend to be overly complicated and have ridiculous premises, but this movie keeps a great pace with an easy to follow story, that is both deep and heartfelt.<br /><br />Even if you are not a fan of anime, I highly recommend giving this movie a watch.A g
B003YL4KS0|5.0|I love this book. I loved the earlier version and have been following the suggestions for several years.  This version has even more info. I have recommended it to two other curly haired girls in the last week.

B005HSL626|5.0|i first played this game at an arcade place. i was hooked. when i saw it was available for the Kindle Fire (and free) i downloaded it. it works great and just as much fun as the big version at the arcade.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great app.  Many great things to say about the game.  Who doesn't like lining up carnivorous plants to eat zombies, shooting mushroom spores at zombies holding screen doors for a shield.  Who wouldn't like planting an aquatic plant to take out snorkeling zombies in your pool or launching watermelons at a spot lit 70's disco zombie that brings up four of his zombie buddies out of the ground around him.  This list can continue.  The plants are so diverse: from sun flowers that create you energy to plant more plants to a Gatling pea shooter.  And it's possible to place a tiki torch in front of any of the pea shooters to create a flaming projectile to take out: a rushing Zombie in a football uniform or the pole vaulting zombie, or the Zamboni driving Zombie and so on and so on.  There are many types of plants to plant and many types of Zombies to combat, each with their own abilities.  Easy UI helps you get right into the game without much of a wait.  A pretty good way to spend $2.99 cause i just drank a $3 cup of coffee writing this review and i cant go back to drink more coffee.  But i can go back and take out a wave of Zombies with a watermelon launcher without paying another $2.99....hat's off to POPCAP games.
B002M9WW30|3.0|I grew up with these movies. I was very excited when I heard that they were to be released in BluRay. However, the BluRay transfer is simply sub-par.<br /><br />Most of the dark scenes are pixilated beyond belief. I own the first(and best) of these movies in VHS. Frankly, the VHS video quality seems almost as good.<br /><br />The fight scenes are better but still not very good. If you own these in any other format, do not bother to upgrade.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was extremely disappointed in the book. I had not read her previous books but several grandchildren had read them all. The book is marketed as an adult book, but I was not prepared for the sexual content or graphic descriptions of various characters less than perfect body parts.. I had planned to buy another copy as a gift for a friend recovering from surgery but will buy the latest John Grishom book instead. I am probably a quarter of the way through the book and will not bother to read more. I wish Amazon had a return policy like Costco. I would like to be able to return the Kindle book for a refund.
1439153663|2.0|This was not a Pleasant book to read. I have read many books, both fact (a lot of fact) and some fiction, on slavery. I was raised in the South and am familiar with the antebullum South and how it operated. My father remembers very well, the having of sharecroppers, which were the generation that was one past salvery. So, I have heard and read about salves, white Southerners and Sharecroppers. I know that bad things happened, but for the most, slaves were a very valuable assest and, may have been treated as dumb animals, but very expensive dumb animals requiring food, housing (no it was not good), medicine and even life insurance.<br />I am not sure where this author was coming from, but I found this book to be a personification of evil. The slaves, and white child, were held in evil cirumstances with an evil overseer. The white Southerners were irresponsible and the wife was drugged out of her mind. I have never read a ficitonal account where so many bad things happened...one right on top of the other. Only in books recounting injustices in the medical profession, have I seen so many failings right in a row.<br />I thought the book was awful. I did not really see the purpose in the injustices that just kept coming: then I read the Author's Note and she had had a Vision about what happened on Slave Hill. This lady was into some bad happenings, either counsciously, or prehaps, mistakening. And from the evil she saw in her heart, she produced a posionous novel. I think it is best for throwing away and not reading!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like playing this game at the end of the day to relax. Its great because its free and has so many levels.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I owned the Marware Vibe for the original Kindle Fire & loved it.<br /><br />When I upgraded to the Kindle Fire HD, I decided to try a few different cases. None compared to this one. They were too bulky, too awkward, hard to fold the cover back, etc. When I saw that Marware had the Vibe for the KF HD, I grabbed it! Oh how I missed you! I never thought I would be this excited over a case but I am.<br /><br />The Vibe isn't bulky at all, it fits perfectly. This one holds the Fire HD by clips on each corner. You just press the corners in and you will hear a click as they catch. You do have to give a good hard push. At first, I was afraid there was something wrong when it didn't just pop in. With a little force, it clicked in place & is now very secure. Instructions are included.<br /><br />If you had the Vibe for the original Fire, this is the exact same cover. If not, you will love it if you are looking for a simple case/stand.<br /><br />You can hold your KF like a book, or use it as a stand. You can angle it anyway you want, which is very convenient. The inside of the cover is made of a soft material that leaves me feeling comfortable that it will not scratch. The outside of the cover is a smooth material, the front has a nice textured look while the spine & back are completely smooth. If you get something on the cover by accident, it will wipe away easily. There is an elastic band that folds around to hold the front cover shut when not in use. You can also use it to help hold the cover back when folded over. The spine is flexible you can fold the front cover back if reading, etc. It feels sturdy, like it wouldn't crack over time. I used my other one for about 6 months & there was little to no wear.<br /><br />This won't offer much protection if dropped, this is mainly a cover to protect from scratches with the benefit of a stand. Definitely my favorite case and so glad to have it back!
B008AWBQGW|4.0|has a couple of good songs...not as good as god and guns but a solid effort by van zant and crew
B001AFF25W|5.0|This silm book is worth its weight in gold. The 21 principles, if implemented faithfully, will guarantee success. This book makes more sense than a library of self help books. Readers who buy it and implement its contents will find it much easier to attain their goals.
B005K01VZS|5.0|This book reinforced my belief in the inherent goodness of people and the power to recover from the most difficult events and circumstances.
B008XG1X18|3.0|The new version is not as good as the older version. This version locks up much more often. This version also makes it more difficult to see, it was better when you could only see 2 rows at a time. The Kindle is only so big you can only squeeze so much onto one screen.

B007EECSFA|5.0|THE SECRET KEEPER by Kate Morton<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER is one of those novels that I cannot explain in words.  The amazing depth with which Kate Morton pulls the reader into the storyline left me dizzy and at times wondering about the world into which I was pulled.<br /><br />In 1959 Laurel Nicolson, then 16 years old, witnessed a murder on her family's farm and Laurel knew she had to keep a secret for fear her family would be torn apart. Little did she know that her entire life was built upon a lie. 52 years later, in 2011, Laurel will be called home as her mother lies dying and Laurel is determined to discover the truth behind that fateful day back in 1959.  Throughout the story we follow Laurel as she uncovers her mother's secret past through journals, photographs and the ramblings of a dying woman.<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER takes the reader on a journey that spans close to 100 years.  From the birth of an author to the death of woman whose heart had been broken too many times, the novel is divided into four sections that overlap each other as the story unfolds. Laurel is the daughter of Dorothy (Dolly) Nicolson, a beloved mother and wife, who raised a family and tended her husband with care and pride. But Laurel and her mother kept a secret that Laurel hoped her mother would finally acknowledge the truth.<br /><br />The novel travels back and forth from present day to a time before the start of WWII when Laurel's mother was a young woman in love hoping to start a life with the man of her heart.  Then in a span of a few years down to a few months, the war would claim more than just the victims of a bomb.  Heartbreak and sorrow, betrayal and pain, love and hate all mesh together when the lives of four people will become embroiled in a game of deceit and lies, and in the end, secrets that will be carried to the grave.<br /><br />The characters are as emotionally colorful as they are distractingly real.  You have empathy for a daughter about to lose her connection to the past, but with that comes the realization that everything she thought she knew about her family history had been a total lie. A death bed confession brings about a world of confusion when the mind of a dying old woman cannot be trusted to know fantasy from fact.  But something Laurel's mother said would trigger a waterfall of emotion and memories that start Laurel on a path to discover who was the woman they had all called Ma.<br /><br />THE SECRET KEEPER is an amazing, well-written and emotionally draining look at the family dynamics built on lies and deceit. The character development and world building draws the reader into the storyline as though you were part of the action and conflict.  Kate Morton's look into the lives of desperate people during desperate times and it takes the love of a daughter to uncover the truth of what happened in 1941 and how it affected her family and her life in 1959. I cannot say enough about this amazing story.  I was pulled in and held on for a ride that I will not soon forget.  If you want a recommendation about the next book to read, pick up THE SECRET KEEPER and unravel the mystery alongside Laurel Nicholson as she uncovers the truth behind a life hidden behind a lie started so long ago.ization that everything she thought she knew about her family history had been a total lie.

B007M45PMU|5.0|I listened to most of the songs from this album on youtube before buying it, and I was amazed at how many of them I loved. usually I only like three songs per cd at best, but I liked almost every single one of these. great album, can't wait to see them live!
B00913P6G0|5.0|I bought this album on a whim and what a pleasant surprise. The first listen was enjoyable but I wasn't blown away, but the third or fourth spin I knew I was listening to something special.Kendrick Lamar has a dazzlingly complex style with layers and subtleties rarely seen in Hip Hop, switching flows and cadences on a dime, he puts his contemparies to shame, over a series of immaculately produced beats with unique drum patterns that most rappers probably wouldn't even consider. Alot of the music has a fairly soulful sound too it, but with a more laid back feeling thankfully, a fresh breath from the bombastic sounds the genre sometimes produces. As for his subject matter, there are a couple of songs about peer pressure, including the very clever lead single Swimming Pools (drank) ,which is ridiculously catchy. He also talks about growing up in the ghetto and the trappings of that lifestyle. He never glorifies violence or drug use, but nor does he play anything down or adopt a preaching tone, resulting in a refreshingly human album that makes Kendrick seem like a real guy, unlike the cartoonish exaggerations so rampant in hip hop. I am also very thankful for the fact that alot of the songs tell a story of sorts, never does he resort to boasting or verses laden with punchline after punchline that don't say anything. The end result is a fine collection of songs with wide range appeal that play smoothly from start to finish with no finish. Bottom line, Good kid m.a.a.d.city is an excellent and excellently original hip hop album that deftly sidesteps any sterotypes you can imagine. It plays like butter from start to finish with fantastic lyrics and incredible beats. If you want to hear some great music, buy this album.
B00913P6G0|5.0|First and foremost, congratulations to another successful music artist coming from Compton, CA.  They really know how to make compelling music.<br /><br />Now on to the review of Kendrick Lamar's good Kidd, m.A.A.d city.<br /><br />Many people are calling this a masterpiece, and I must agree that this music is certainly original and great storytelling as rap/hip hop ought to be.  Sure there's party music and club bangers which are suitable for a certain situation, but Kendrick's music definately takes the listener deep into his world.  And for that I thank you Mr. Lamar, and only time will tell if it's a master piece or not.  So far, I can't stop playing it, so that's a good sign.<br /><br />I briefly break down each track I like.  Also keep in mind that most of the songs have a skit at the end of it (thus why Kendrick calls his album a \\"short film\\")<br /><br />1.  Sherane, Master Splinter's daughter (4/5)<br />This intro to the CD talks about a woman named Sherane and how Kendrick talks about how he would hit it from every angle, like a true gee would... lol, nice work<br /><br />2.  B****, don't kill my vibe (5/5)<br />This is one of my favorite tracks.  Great beat, great hook, great melody, great lyrics!  A true gem on the album.  Love it, have it on repeat...<br /><br />3.  Backseat freestyle (3.5/5)<br />My least favorite of the songs on the album.  He still does a sick flow, and it sounds dope with bass in your trunk if you got it like that.  For the experience of the album, I won't skip it, but it just sounds a little out of place, but still, better than other \\"filler\\" tracks that other artists.  Put it like this, it's a quality filler...lol just my opinion.<br /><br />4.  The Art of Peer Pressure (4.5/5)<br />This track has two songs in one, and the first song is the one I like the most.  That beat is so smooth, and I find myself replaying this first snippet a few times first before I let the second part of the song play.  Kendrick talks about going out anddoing no good cause his homies pressured him into it.  I can relate bro...<br /><br />5.  Money trees (5/5)<br />Another gem on the album with fellow labelmate Jay Rock.  The beat is sick, hook is catchy just like all of Kendrick's hooks, and Jay Rock flips his style a bit.  For those who don't know Jay Rock yet, check him out on youtube, see how he normally raps with a dark and raspy kinda voice, and see the difference on this song.  But yeah, this songs hits so hard, ridiculous man... I love it!<br /><br />6.  Poetic Justice (5/5)<br />This song is the R&B song of the album.  Drake is on it, and I know a lot of people are against the whole young money commericalized music that weezy's camp makes.  But honestly, this song works very well.  The hooks are excellent, drake does he usual lovely dovey flow about the ladies, but Kendrick truely shows you how he feels about women and how he carefully caresses them in phyiscal and emotional levels.  And you know, pay attention to the ladies emotions... learn from Kendrick young men... lol Great track.<br /><br />7.  Good Kid (5/5)<br />This track, produced by Pharell from Neptunes, is hypnotic.  The melody, is quite mellow with a flute (like Tech N9ne's slither), and Kendrick raps about how a good kid has to block out all the bad, kinda like a \\"against all odds\\" kinda vibe, but just my opinion... Kinda like it's hopeless for a young person to avoid all the bad stuff, eventually, you get sucked in...  And this song sucks you in too... reminds of a pyschadelic tune from the 60's on the hook... nice<br /><br />8.  m.A.A.d city (5/5)<br />Totally a banger track, like let's go out mobbin' kinda sound... I like it, and surprisingly MC Eiht is featured on it.  He hasn't changed a bit, and brings old school rap to this track.  Probably not radio friendly considering how \\"pop\\" radio has become, but definately another gem in my opinion.  I find myself blasting my stereo to this one, wearing dark shades, and sitting real slow in da driver seat... fo sho... lol, and it has two songs in one!  Great song...<br /><br />9.  swimming pools (drank) (5/5)<br />Another gem, and one of the singles off the album on the radio.  Talks about drinking problems people have.  Makes the sickest hook on the album, \\"why you babysitting two or three shots, I'm a show you how to turn it up a notch.......Pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it\\", genious...  If you haven't heard this song yet, don't call yourself a fan of rap music.  A great track to get motivated and well, drink!<br /><br />10.  Sing about me, I'm dying of thrist (5/5)<br />Another gem, and the deepest message on the album.  I interpret this song as hey, \\"fam and friends, life is short.  Let's do what we can with what little time we have, and love each other each and every day.  Let bygones be bygones, forgive but don't forget, reminsce on the past and grow from it, do something special because we ain't promised tomorrow, and never take anything for granted because you'll regret it.\\"  When an artist can do all of this in a song, they will be talked about for a very long time and songs like these can pick people up at their lowest of lows, and believe again in whatever it is that got them out of bed that morning... I'm just rambling on and on, but I can't say enough about this song, and I KNOW OTHER PEOPLE CAN'T GET IT OUT OF THEIR HEAD EITHER...<br /><br />11.  Real (4.5/5)<br />Sweet track.  So jazz inspired, like tribe called quest.  I guess it's about being real.  I know, not much of a description, but man, it's relaxing.  Like trance like... I think he's talking about a woman.  Women, don't be so materialistic?  haha I know not all are, but thanks to Nikki, they be getting stuck on gold digger mentality...lol jk, nice track<br /><br />12.  Compton (5/5)<br />The closing track of the album with Dr. Dre.  Another amazing track about Kendrick's beloved city of Compton.  Had this song before the album came out, played it on a regular, and it's great aswell.  An excellent choice to end the album.  There's a piano in the song, and well, if you're a fan of pianos like me, then you're in for a treat.  And Dre still gets down on the mic, even if Kendrick writes the lyrics for Dre to spit...<br /><br />Overall, totally digging the album.  I first listened to Kendrick on Tech's all 6's and 7's I love music track.  Then Jay Rock's Follow me home album... Then section 80, and at that point, I knew it'd only be a matter of time before Kendrick made a studio album.  He's made his mark of what he's capable of, and from this point forward, he's going to continue to evolve into a special musician.  I suspect that he'll branch out and do other projects like movies, but his heart will always be in hip hop.  Hip hop has been saved once again.  In my opinion, hip hop was never in danger.  You just have to look hard enough, like the old saying goes, \\"seek and you shall find\\".  I'm going to show all the hip hop haters what excellent hip hop really sounds like, and if they still can't appreciate it, then they're really not worth my time and energy.  If you've read this far, then a sincere thanks for taking the time as I have writing this review, and trust me, it's QUALITY music.  God bless you, Kendrick Lamar...<br /><br />$PMONEY$

B00422LESO|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Shannon Hale.  Indeed, my kindle boasts at least 6 of her books and yet I am just now discovering the wonders within.  It was witty and in fact I laughed out loud at one part to which my husband said simply, \\"It's good.\\"<br /><br />Austenland follows the quick narrative of Jane Hayes.  She is obsessed with Dr. Darcy and in fact all things Jane Austen.  She is also ashamed of her Austen obsession.  She has lunch with her Great Aunt Carolyn, and said aunt arranges for Jane to visit Pembrook Park.  At Pembrook Park, visitors completely immerse themselves in 1806 or 1809 or somewhere abouts.  The give up all technology, and dress, act and speak as if they are in fact in 1809.  There are others there, like Jane who are visiting for 3 weeks.  And the rest are actors, paid to give the guests whatever experience they want.<br /><br />Jane is embarrassed to be at Pembrook Park.  She eventually goes for the gusto.  There is some feel of not knowing how far the farce goes at times.  The reader (at least this reader) wondered how many people were in on farce.<br /><br />For Jane, there are two love interests.  Mr. Nobley, who actually presents as \\"Mr. Darcy\\" and Martin/Theodore the gardener who she sneaks off with to have forbidden technology with.  My one complaint with the book was that Jane vacillated between them even until the end!
B005I64U5C|1.0|The discs are OK.  My frustration is towards the Ultraviolet digital copy. I could not obtain the copy even though I am a valid customer and have the code.  It is all because I am not in USA.  Not fair not fair.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I loved this book. I couldn't wait for it to come out and I can't wait for the third either. I hope they just keep writing this series! Can't get enough!
B007SGM084|1.0|These books are basically about a guy repeatedly beating the s**t out of his girl friend \\"because he needs to\\" and her returning to him over and over.  The books sensationalize and sexualize the abuse of women, pure and simple.  Sickening and gross.  I regret my purchase.

B007UQRW62|5.0|This \\"Singin' In The Rain\\" 60th Anniversary boxed set is fabulous!  I love the movie which ALWAYS puts a smile on my face.  The commemorative book is terrific and all the extras are great.  If you love this film then you will certainly love this boxed set with all the extras. My one year old granddaughter and 5 year old grandson LOVE all the musical numbers.  The first time my grandson saw Donald O'Connor doing \\"Make Em Laugh\\" he couldn't stop laughing and I had to replay it for him over and over again.  Well worth the cost.  The umbrella is wonderful, excellent quality...now if I could only dance like Gene Kelly!!!<br /><br />[ASIN:B007UQRW62 Singin' In The Rain: 60th Anniversary Collector's Edition (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]

0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a historical fiction young adult novel. The book is narrated by Death. He tells the story of a little girl. I really like the style in which the book is written. The author, Markus Zusak, does an amazing job in telling the story of a little girl. His writing style is different from other books that I have read but I find it very intriguing. It does seem to set the tone of the narrator, Death. His writing style portrays the setting very well. Death is talking in first person about the story of this particular little girl.<br /> The book takes place in Nazi Germany during World War II. The story mostly takes place in the small, fictional, town of Molching, Germany, on Himmel Street. The book seems to be very accurate with what I know about Nazi Germany during World War II. Hitler was in charge. He hated the Jews and the black people, therefore he did what he could to get rid of them and make their lives miserable. The author very much makes it seem as if you are there witnessing the story yourself. You can picture it very clearly as you read the book. The little girl's name in The Book Thief is Leisel Meminger and her best friend is Rudy Steiner. Her foster parents are Rosa and Hans Hubermann. The characters are described very well in the book and seem very life like.  Rudy is a very exciting person. In the book he and his family are watching the Olympics and they see a black man win. They are very surprised. Rudy, being himself, covers himself in charcoal from the fire, rides his bike to the school, and runs around the track fantasizing that he is Jesse Owens (the black man who won in the Olympics). Rosa has a very strong personality. She is constantly getting upset with Leisel and, well, everyone. Deep down though, she is a very loving person. Hans is a very kind and loving person. You can tell that from the moment you meet him in the book. He's always there for Leisel and willing to help her in any way possible. Leisel is the bookthief. She has gone through a lot by the age of nine and will go through quite a bit more as the story goes on.<br />In the very beginning, when everything starts, she steals her first book. She is on a train on her way to her foster parents with her mother and brother. Her brother was originally going to go with her to their new home with their foster parents, but he never made it because he dies. She steals her first book while they have stopped to figure out what to do with her brother's body. It is snowy and white outside and she sees a little black book. It is a gravedigger's handbook and she takes it. It's the first of many books for her to steal.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I read the book on my Kindle, and was a bit disappointed on the less than perfect editing (I found several instances where a parentheses was missing).  At first I had a hard time keeping all the characters straight, but as I read, it got easier and easier until I just 'knew' them.  I usually do not read books with main characters that I dislike, and this was a book where I did not like many of the characters... sometimes.  At other times I liked them best.  As I read, my allegience to various characters kept switching; and that is the point, right?  People are complicated and 3-D, not paper dolls, so even in my own life there are people I at first glance like or don't like, and later I change my mind.<br /><br />I finished the book two days ago, and I still keep thinking about it.  In my mind, life is continuing in town and with the characters.  It is almost like I opened up a tiny window into the town life, watched for a while, then closed the window; things are still happening, but I'm no longer watching.  I guess that feeling comes from the book being pretty realistic.  Nothing is perfect, and there is good in the worst of people and situations.<br /><br />I will probably read it again, but not for a couple months.  For now, I think it was very well written, and a wonderful, thought-provoking read.
0345522478|3.0|HOUNDED is a fairly shallow book, but one with some good moments. You'll never buy for a moment that smug wannabe-hipster Atticus O'Sullivan is actually a druid two millenia old; he sounds like nothing more than a Prius-driving leftist refugee from California. To Hearne's credit, though, he speeds on through this and doesn't spend much time trying to sell you on it.<br /><br />Parts of the book are very satisfying. There are several laugh-out-loud moments, especially involving Atticus' hound, Oberon. However, for every one of these, there is another that induces cringes (if not nausea), usually involving the Widow MacDonagh, a broad and unfunny Irish stereotype. Atticus comes across as a poor man's Harry Dresden written as a Marty Stu (he can heal almost instantly, he's immortal, he has a sword that can cut through anything, and anything he can't do, he has immensely powerful friends who can - might as well rename him Wolverine).<br /><br />Pacing is very brisk - too much so in some places. Violence is quickly resolved with minimal words expended; this is something of a blessing as Hearne is more gifted at dialogue than writing fights. Everything goes quickly, but this worsens the problem of shallowness in the book.<br /><br />Politically and/or religiously sensitive types might also want to steer clear of the series. While not as bad here as later books in the series, Hearne wears his leftist quasi-atheism on his sleeve and has no problems being offensive to either conservative Christian or Jew. (Note that you won't see Mohammed popping up in this series, and the lone mention of Allah takes pains not to make him a joke like every other deity in the series; Hearne even scrubs comments asking about this odd double-standard from his blogs without answering, all the while blustering about his intolerance of the intolerant.)<br /><br />All in all, I've paid more to read worse. Worth a checkout from the library to see if it's your thing.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|When I saw the trailer for this new Dark Shadows movie, I was not a happy camper.  Just a few nights ago, I decided to give the movie a try and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.<br />No, it isn't the original DS--and it isn't trying to be.  At least give the film a chance.  If you want the original series, fine, but if you want something new, fresh, and different, give Dark Shadows 2012 a look.
0452295548|4.0|A very interesting book detailing the authors experience during the stroke episode as well as her rehabilitation.  It presents important information regarding how our brains operate, how we can alter its activity and understand how it causes the differences in our behavior and personality. I would recommend that anyone with a brain read it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Gripping , very well written incredible display of writing talent. I will definitely be looking forward to more awesome reads!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Well worth the cost. Fun, enjoyable, worth the time and effort to play. Quick paced but doesn't seem to pass as fast as it seems.  well worth the download.
B009KHBDUU|1.0|Pretty simple....This movie put me to sleep.  Plot was shallow.  With few exceptions, the humor was sorely lacking. Not what I am used to with Depp movies.
B008NABUU8|3.0|good thing I got this game as free app of the day cause its not the best game. I personally would not pay 2 dollars for this app.  It pretty hard to build the bridges.

B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Takes the standard match 3 and puts a story with it. Timed and challenging like some of the original games of this type
B008NABUU8|4.0|bridge constructor is a great game and fun some of the levels are kinda  tricky but it gets your brain going.
0345525558|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I loved the glossary at the end which gave the meaning associated with every imaginable flower.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a great game for kids and parents to play together. My 6yr old son loves it. He even gets his grandparents. playing.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is absolutley the best movie EVER!  My grandsons just LOVE it and every adult that has watched it really enjoyed it too!!!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|There are very little instructions on how to use the power ups. Once my son showed me the game was easy. Good time killer.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The book started out slow because of the cast of characters but it was well written and keeps<br />you interested. Some of the children seemed a little over the top but basically, it was life<br />in the suburbs and  worth the time.
B004811PMO|5.0|I loved this movie growing up and now I have the opportunity to share it with my children :) Very pleased
B009KUANWG|5.0|This \\"Bond\\" theme by Adele is one of the best in many years and harks back to some of the classics of the genre!!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie, better with more viewings! Quality excellent. Wish there were more special features. Can't wait for the next movies in the series.
0060763280|2.0|In preparation for a long flight I was caught in a bind with nothing to read and was at an airport that carried very few English books.  I went on a limb and picked this up due to the lack of options.<br /><br />It was an easy read but at the end of reading it, I wondered if my time would have been better spent staring aimlessly at the seat in front of me.<br /><br />This book lacked substance and came across as a giant sales pitch for the author's seminars.  Do not waste your time on this one.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I updated this app last night and now I can't start the game. It starts to load the stopps saying the app has stopped working unexpectedly. I have a vibrant.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|wow I loved this game. it actually took me a few days to finish it which is saying a lot because it was nearly impossible to put down. big fish games-keep making games like this and I will keep buying them!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|parents stop letting your stupid kids review these games.awesome game. best game app for the kindle fire I have played in my opinion.except ignorent kids who doesn't love physics based games.angry birds is the most overrated game out.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I love using this because I found a hidden talent I had while using this app. I could also use some help too. Instead of after placing the picture making it stay how it is, you should be able to move it into the spot you want it. A great app though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|No complaints about this app, does what it's supposed to do.  Many happy hours wasted, er, spent pinning crockpot recipes and gardening ideas.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|This film is not for everyone, and I know several people who would probably label this film as \\"weird.\\" But if you're a Wes Anderson fan, you won't be disappointed. Excellent story and script. Excellent cast and acting. One scene was a tad disturbing for me and my friends, but otherwise, this is a sweet film with laughs and thoughtful moments. I loved it.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I did not have HBO, so I purchased seasons 1 and 2 on DVD in order to watch this series. By the end of the first episode, I was hooked. Boardwalk Empire has a fine ensemble cast of regulars and recurring characters, headed by Steve Buscemi as Enoch \\"Nucky\\" Thompson (loosely based on real life Atlantic City boss Nucky Johnson). Direction, sets, costuming and props are all first class, convincingly taking the viewer back to the prohibition era. Characters are well developed and richly portrayed. Nucky interfaces with many other historical figures, such as Arnold Rothstein, Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Johnny Torrio, Al Capone, and political figures such as President Warren Harding, Attorney General Harry Daugherty, and Sen. Walter Edge. Liberties are taken in adapting historical figures to plot lines, but it's all well done.<br /><br />Be aware that there is graphic violence and sexual content in this series. Put the kids to bed before you partake!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|wonderful adaptation of the classic Bejeweled game.  The fish are realistically colored and the plants and other decorations are quite detailed.
B009329ZF2|5.0|It is awesome awesome very good movie awesome awesome and very good movie I liked it very good verry good verry good
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! I would recommend it to anyone interested in this type of book! I can't wait for the next one to come out!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This novel was not as good as \\"Gone Girl\\" but close. A very creepy story line, but impossible to put down.
B004XCUEXY|4.0|Excellent documentary. The band being honest about what they went through, the ups and downs, and all those challenges that bands have to overcome to keep it going.  Lots of lessons learned!
B004OO4UFY|5.0|This band offer a unique sound taht blend funk,rock, jazz and r&b mixed with a modern hip hop feel. You can't go wrong with this one!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and the other two books that follow it are without question, some of the most intense books I have ever read.  I am thrilled and have referred this trilogy to several people and they have been in awe of the books as well.<br />The plot and the characters are unforgettable and it is an absolute heartbreak that Stieg Larsson is not with us anymore and we don't have his genius to look forward to.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|When you think Stephen King, you normally think horror.  This book was not.  It was a really great read, and hard to put down.  The premise of time travel and changing the past was done in a fresh way.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Super addicting and fun. I can play this over and over. I like the obstacles in this &quot;bejeweled&quot; kind of game.
0142410349|5.0|The book is a great story.Classic. I read it to my daughter she enjoyed it very much.  The book was The book was very affordable  and arrived in a timely  manner in great condition!
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|The series started off a little weird and confusing but everything gets laid out perfectly. The acting is superb and the writing is great. My only issue was *<<<(SPOILER)>>>* the weird deformed creature in the attic. That was a little too far out in my opinion.<br /><br />If you're looking for an addictive show that will leave you wanting more, this is the show for you. I was completely sucked in and thoroughly enjoyed it. It's a great story with lots of twists and suspense. Kudos to the writers for making a show that's actually worth watching on regular cable. I absolutely love it! It's not your typical series, which is what makes it so fresh.
B002UXRGM0|4.0|I got a copy of the BBC series Planet Earth on DVD for UK Pounds 12/ from Amazon last year. Man what a series and the best 12 pounds I have ever spent. Now this ie Life wow. AND THAT TOO IN BLUE RAY. Even on a 32 inch LCD with Hi Dif ready ie in 720 mode 'out of this world'.
B001D09OAI|5.0|[[ASIN:0792110722 Major League]]  This movie is tense and hilarious. I got it thru Amazon. I've seen all three Major League movies and they are all fun. It makes the reader tense with minor suspense, I had made a VCR tape of it but never had a DVD copy. Now  can watch it often without risking the loss of the recorded copy. I can't erase it by mistake. I bought all three movies at once so i can have a Major League Film Festival. Perfect for a winter night.
B00913P6G0|5.0|This CD is a masterpiece, didn't have to change songs when listening. Great album, possibly album of the year.Classic. Hip-Hop is alive and well, thanks to Kendrick Lamar.
B0009WT83O|5.0|This is a CLASSIC kung fu flick in the truest sense. A very cool twist on a traditional story line (the hero/good guy doesn't know he's the \\"chosen one\\" & tries very hard to be a bad guy by joining the villians/Axe Gang; but he fails miserably at being a bad guy. Towards the end of the movie, he finally realizes HE'S the hero/good guy), PLENTY of AWESOME & INCREDIBLY choreographed fighting, GREAT special effects (that don't look kooky), MANY FUNNY scenes (like when the hero, as bad guy, ends up stabbing himself instead of his victim; and when he's instructed by the villian to kill a victim by hitting them in the head with a big piece of wood but instead, ends up hitting a bad guy over the head...then hits the villian over the head), and GREAT dialogue/lines. If you like martial arts and/or martial arts movies, you will LOVE Kung Fu Hustle!

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|There's a new book at the top of my all-time fave list...and it's A Discovery of Witches.<br /><br />Every page took me deeper and deeper into an A-mazing new world, rich with historical context, filled with magic and love. Love against and despite all of society's silly rules and expectations.<br /><br />It's truly one of the best love stories every told, and I can't wait to continue the journey with Diana and Matthew in Shadow of Night.

B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked Shades of Gray, you'll love Bared to You. Not quite the same, but extremely steamy. Can't wait to read the second book in the series.
B009PJXY3M|5.0|There's not many CDs where I like every song it, those few being Adele's 21 and Lana Del Rey's Born To Die, and Bridgit has amazed me with her debut CD. I'll be adding her to that list!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|I bought this headset a month a go and I really loved it.  you could hear the ame and the chat was great. Then it got a short in the wire. they dont have a place you can call to talk to them or nothing really.  When they get your money then they dont care if it works or not.  I would not recommend this headset.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|This game is boring! No action, no nothing! Please make improvements ASAP! This is not as good as Angry Birds!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Everything I expected from Downey and company...  Absolutley GREAT!!!  I hope to see more of the Avengers in the future.<br /><br />Amazon's punctuality and no risk service continues to amaze me.  I have purchased everthing from movies to large screen televisions and can say I am amazed at the quality of service and pricing that Amazon continues to provide...
B000YH6YG8|5.0|A good portion of this movie speaks for a suppressed and oppressed part of the population, but then it turns into typical anti-white propaganda  where the African American turns out to be the wise one and the white guy is the dumb little whimpering sissy. However you want to look at it it's extremely powerful. I don't pretend to be a movie reviewer, like some people here, just my thoughts.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I didn't read any reviews for the book before purchasing (my bad) and my original expectation was that I'd learn something about her and I didn't. It was entertaining, but definitely something that's better spoken than read- sort of like how Shakespeare is best when it's acted out and not read.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Got this game as one of the free apps of the day.  This game is a great way to pass the time.  Storyline is nice and graphics are amazing.  I don't know if I would spend $4.99 for it but still a great game.
B007NG93CK|3.0|As above, I am a bit of a Kathy Reichs fan. However, I only thought this one was okay with an interesting and unique plot. A few too many characters and it did feel like Ms Reichs was a bit rushed in trying to tie up all the loose ends and get to the conclusion. Apart from that, pretty good but definately not one of her best.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This television series is the closest thing to an ongoing full feature cinematic experience that I have ever seen on television. It is very suspenseful, with a great story line and some great acting.
B006ZZQH4W|5.0|An excellent read, especially for parents, who are unable to let their  children leave home!<br />Also an insight to what a \\"grown Up\\" family feels like.The book is a quick humerous read, and would be perfect<br />to take on a plane or train trip. I love Maeve Binchy......her stories are so real.<br />Hope to find more on Amazon of the same ilk. five star book
030758836X|1.0|I read the book on my Kindle and was captured right away.  The story line was interesting from the beginning, although I questioned whether I liked any of the characters at all.  I heard there was a big twist at the end, but who knew the twist was that the story just stopped.  There wasn't an ending, there was no wrap up, there was no plot twist (at the end anyway)...nothing.  It just STOPPED. I gave this one star because the beginning of the story was interesting enough to make me read through to what I expected to be a very good ending.  Oh well.  Save your money.  *By the way, one of the reviewers stated that the author admitted she had no ending and that her editor had to help her finish the book.  Really?  I thought when writing a story one knows of the ending and works through the story toward that ending.  Can't imagine how the book was published in the first place.
B008XG1X18|4.0|much better w/latest fixes. still can be slow and freeze up but much improved!  I love my pintersst and spend wwaayy too much time on it!!!
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|I used to love this game, but now all the balls are black! Totally impossible to play as you cannot differentiate solid balls from striped. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, etc. with no change. Please fix this!!! Very disappointing to say the least.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Great series.  There was nothing I needed to know before purchasing this item it was a set of DVDs.  I am very happy with my purchase and cant wait until season 4 comes out on DVD.  I will be purchasing it from amazon again like I do everything else!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game to be available for the Kindle forever! I love it! The only problem is that about once every ten times I play it glitches a bit. But still, it's a great game!

B0034G4P80|4.0|I have been a THOR comic fan for years. This movie didn't follow the comic story line of how he came to earth, but still, it was an awesome movie.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Poor Harry Hole - he just never seems to get a break. This book left me wondering if I will ever read another story about him. . .
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was an excellent movie. It was well written, and the actors are excellent for the characters they played. The only bad spot was having scarlett Johansson in this movie.
B007EDYN36|4.0|Let me start by saying that I was a huge Kiss and Peter Criss fan as a kid in the seventies.  And my loyalty always was to Peter above the other three band members - although I liked them all. I am not a Kiss fanatic today nor have I been a member of the Kiss Army since I was ten.  lol  So when I saw this book, at first I was skeptical, thinking it may be a money grab for Peter.  But after debating, I went ahead and bought the Kindle version and dove in.  To my surprise, this is actually a good book that fills in some of the holes surrounding facts that have been out there for years.  I started in chapter one about Peter's upbringing, but quickly skipped to chapter 4 that begins to narrate the Kiss years.  It is enlightening to hear how much input and influence that Bill Aucoin, his partner Sean, and Neil Bogart had in shaping the band leading to its success.  A lot of the ideas that have been attributed to the members of the band really came from outside sources as you'll see as you read through. Sadly, Peter is his own worst enemy and he clearly has some undealt with anger towards the other band members.  And most of his bad luck is his own doing.  He comes across as honest and sincere, yet entitled and ungrateful so it is really hard to feel sorry for him - particularly due to his malicious statements towards just about everybody but his current wife and his daughter.  If you are on the fence concerning this book, it is well organized and worth a read for sure.  I found the book hard to put down as I knew little of his life after Kiss.  It has a happy ending as he seems to have a good relationship with his current wife and is a cancer survivor.  I always wondered exactly why he left and this book certainly answers that question.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really enjoy having Pinterest on my Kindle Fire. I tend to use it more on a portable device.  Great use of commercial time when watching Tv. I love seeing things that interest my niece now that she's off at college, although what's up with all those tatoo pins?
145162607X|5.0|Phillipa Gregory has a real knack for making ancient history vivid and alive, and this new book of hers is no exception. In 15th century England, at the time of the Cousins War to take the throne, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, was the most powerful man in the land, but unfortunately he had no son or heir. So he concentrated on his daughters, Anne and Isabel, determined to make one of them Queen of England. We first meet the sisters as delightful little girls, especially Anne, who hardly knowing what was happening to her, was married at 14 to a royal duke. But she was soon widowed and married again to another king-to-be, this time  a man she loved and admired. However, her beloved father is killed in battle, her mother placed in sanctuary (really house arrest), and her dear sister and confidant, Isabel, married to the enemy. Although Anne does her best to cope and be a loyal wife and mother, the court is so filled with intrigue and betrayals, political conspiracies and worse, mere survival takes all of Anne's wits and cunning. But survive she does, although in the process she loses the last of her innocense and much of her kindness. She also loses her precious only son, Prince Edward, and fails to get pregnant again. Through it all, however, Anne remains likeable, if not always admirable as she tries to adjust to circumstances beyond her control in this never-ending battle for power. In addition to Anne, all the characters in the story are vividly drawn, and with its lush descriptions and page-turning suspense this is history made vivid and palatable as the kingmaker's dream finally comes to fruition when, against all odds, his daughter Anne becomes Queen of England.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it. great to do with your kids or by yourself can get addicting love the missions and rooms
1594203334|5.0|I should start off by saying that throughout my pregnancy and my child's infancy, I never read a single parenting book. Every book will tell you something different, so I wasn't a big believer in this genre of self-help book. That said, this book's description sounded interesting and I wanted a non-traditional perspective. So far, I am halfway through the book, and although I don't 100% agree with everything, I think the author brings up many practical points that have a lot of value. My daughter is 16 mo, and I wish I read this when she was a bit younger; but there are still a lot of tips that I can use now and as she grows. Like any \\"parenting\\" book, it's up for the reader to decide what they buy into, but I love the fresh viewpoint and the author's sense of humor - it definitely gave me food for thought.

0307716988|5.0|Let me start by saying, that Michael is an amazing person. This book, has to be the best book of an autobiography by a well-known superstar ever written. I love the way Michael captivates the audience by telling from his point of view the stories of being with the Jackson 5, The Destiny Tour, the making of \\"We Are the World\\", just to name a few. Not only does he talk about his huge and major accomplishments, but he also provides fans with life lessons, and advice to show them they actually have a chance to succeed. Michael is one of those rare, and beautiful people that shows us there is no mountain high enough, or no valley low enough, in which one can go to, to get to where they need to go. I LOVE this book. I know this has to be my second time reading it, since buying it in the summer of 2011. Even when I'm not officially in the book, I like to go back, and read just a few of his words. I've even got emotional over some of the things he talked about. Like, how sometimes he felt so lonely. I won't tell the entire book but, this is a MUST for any wholehearted MJ fan like I am. He was so much more than a singer. Much more than an entertainer. He had so much to offer, and in so many ways. God, I love reading his words. And the good part about it is, it was Michael saying these things. Not the media. Not the press or tabloids to slander him.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is and excellent book i couldnt stop reading but i always do have to stop reading u should read this book

0525953728|5.0|I love this book. Easy reading and interesting in how the truth can be told. Helps me understand what happens on a mission our war heros must go through to get a job done and do it right! All the time and involvement there is with the men they work with. Trust is a big word.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I really love this CD by Taylor Swift.I want it so bad for Christmas.My favorite song is \\"I knew you were trouble\\"I just love it so much.<br /><br />State OF Grace: I really liked this song, So I'm going to give it a 9/10<br />Red: I loved this song! It takes you through the experiences of somebody you really love and what it feels like 10/10<br />Treacherous: Sad, almost like Sad Beautiful Tragic but it is a little faster. Nice slow, but not to slow of song 9/10<br />I Knew You Were Trouble: Fast, upbeat and poppy. Taylor did say her album was going to be a mix of emotions. It is a great song to start off her pop career instead of Country. Nice! 10/10<br />All Too Well: This song is about what they had, but don't have it anymore. 8/10<br />22: I absolutely love this song It's fun, fresh and danceable. It talks about forgetting everything and just having fun with people you love. 10/10<br />I Almost Do: This song is one of my favorites. It pushes Taylor's voice to a high note in the middle. Love this song! 10/10<br />We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together: This song was just for fun. And people need to get a grip on that. Just because she hugs someone doesn't mean she is dating them. Does your mom hug you? Yes, does that mean your dating her? No, it does not, so shut your pie hole. 10/10<br />Stay Stay Stay: It's sort of Ironic that it comes after We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together. This song is fun and danceable like 22. 10/10<br />The Last Time: The only problem with this song is that Gary overpowers Taylor's voice at the end. 8/10<br />Holy Ground: This song is amazing. Noting else to say. 10/10<br />Sad Beautiful Tragic: Nice and Slow:) 10/10<br />The Lucky One: Song is fabulous! 9/10<br />Everything has Changed: Awesome song, Taylor's voice and Ed's voice just are great together! 10/10<br />Starlight: The Song speaks about looking at first love and the Joy. 10/10<br />Begin Again: A Great song to End the album. 9/10
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I could not wait to read this book after reading Bared to You.  I read it in 3 days, could not put it down.  I am so excited and can not wait to read the 3rd book to find out what happens next.  I have so many different ideas of which way the 3rd book will go.  I hope Sylvia Day continues to write these types of love stories.  I have not read in years while raising my kids, now I have time and have enjoyed the books.  The book is easy to read and full of excitement.<br />Please continue to write these types of books.  It is very similar to Fifty Shades which I also loved.<br />Thank you for your gift of writing.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I would have liked to have seen more of Josh Holloway from #LOST, otherwise it was a good, but predictable MI movie!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I would initially say that this film - unlike the rest of the 'Aliens' franchise - poses significant ontological/metaphysical questions as critical structural elements (whether they are a well handled or not). I can imagine that the film could be offensive to some with strong religious beliefs. One could also treat these ideas as pure fantasy or even accept them as some kind of genuine critical thesis and enjoy the film because it really just uses these ideas as a vehicle for what is, after all, mostly an action-oriented sci-fi movie; one with a smidge more depth perhaps, than others. Cinematographically, handled with the usual deftness and aplomb that one would expect from Ridley Scott; though there are a few things that I thought were goofy (**POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT** notably the escape scene of certain character having had a certain surgical procedure was particularly ridiculous and coulda/shoulda been at least 'scified' into a semblance of believability). On the whole, I think Prometheus is a cut above its Hollywood peers intellectually; I was well entertained, and I really enjoyed the visuals.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|Well, Men In Black 3 was a great movie!!! Especially the ending!! Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are back in what I think is a great comedy and the best of the three. Oh, and let's not forget about Jemaine Cleament and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays a great agent k. And should star in a biography movie of Tommy Lee Jones. Surprised that this movie doesn't share all the hype along with the Dark Night Rises or the Avengers
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book so much that I read it in two days.  Much better than the first movie!  Love using the prime library and getting to check it out for free.

B008GVD6D8|4.0|A great fast paced read with enough twists and tuns to keep your attention, more than just an erotic romance read. Can't wait for the 3rd book to be released.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This entire series will be a classic along the lines of J.R.R. Tolkien. There is so much more than juvenile entertainment. For those interested in a deeper re-reading may I recommend 'Re-potting Harry Potter.' I look forward to more from this author even though her latest is not up to these standards.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Better than I expected!  It's not your average match 3 game. You must figure how to get the objects out before the time is up. I'm really enjoying playing it. Thanks for the free Game of the Day!
B005NPCUC8|4.0|Of course this is an amazing album. Five stars. The sound is great but the main reason I'm writing this is because the breaks in the songs are obnoxious. There had to be a better way to do it, and they aren't even in the right place. Where one song is flowing into the next it suddenly stops, reminiscent of an 8-track tape, except from what I recall, 8-tracks always faded out and back in if the break was in the middle of a song. This is once instance where I would rather listen on vinyl because of this problem.Very disappointing. Minus 1 star for that.
B008NABUU8|4.0|The in game physics engine seems pretty accurate, even allowing for a bridge that will hold a car but not a truck. I like it but, hey, I like bridges!
B0015DROBO|5.0|This one kept me reading.  Very surprising after attempting to watch the movie.  I am looking forward to completing the series.
B008U7ZPHS|4.0|Though I haven't finished the book yet, there is one thing I can say right away: Rick Riordan has done it again... He's been keeping me curious for more than three years. I couldn't wait to read another book and wondered whether the waiting was worth it. And it was.<br /><br />I really like the story-telling from various points of view in the Heroes of Olympus mini-series. As all the heroes express their feelings and thoughts and smoothly reveal the details, they let us slowly untangle the epic fabrication. I love Riordan's mixing of the ancient world stuff and modern devices, spiced with the teenage humor.<br /><br />I'm not a native speaker but I would recommend Rick Riordan's books to students of English as a foreign language who look for adventurous, gripping and funny reading.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I enjoy this game, it uses up quite a bit of time. Don't spend money that is unnecessary. A very nice settler type game.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I accidentally ordered this product mistaking it for the Marware leather case cover.I was worried that I would not be able to return it because I had already opened the packaging. Turns out, I don't have to return it at all and I will still receive my refund. The product itself is lightweight and durable. Good if you're not looking for something with a lot of extra bulk.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|There's all the things the plot draws from:<br />1. \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" (batman comic story)<br />2. \\"Knightfall\\" (batman comic story)<br />3. \\"No Man's Land\\" (batman comic story)<br />4. A mission impossible escape scene in the beginning, actually my favorite part of the movie<br />5. A James bond Goldfinger/Thunderball type \\"find and stop the nuke before it explodes\\" plot line<br />6. Some weird imaginary pit prison that seems like a leftover from inception. Here batman must have a vision quest to escape (it is supposed to be the worst prison on earth, maybe Nolan needs to watch some Oz)<br />7. Some half hearted attempts at an analogy between the villains and the Occupy wall street movement<br />8. A tie in to the first Nolan batman movies villain, who to be honest I didn't remember much about<br />9. I think there's also a kitchen sink in there somewhere<br /><br />Of course, tying all of this together is impossible, so we have some really dumb stuff like Joseph Gordon Levitt's character finding out who batman his just by shaking his hand when he was a kid, the police all going into the sewer at once, Bruce not really caring that his fingerprints were stolen and are obviously going to be used against him, Bruce seemingly having wolverines healing powers, etc.<br /><br />Because of the over abundance of material, nothing really gets the attention it deserve and the movie can't focus on anything. For instance, Bane had the potential to be a great villain, but nothing is really developed with him and in the end he's just a lackey and he has one of the most anti-climax defeats in movie history. As for Batman himself, Nolan seems so bored with him that we barely get to see him, and when we do he is so wimpy you want to go watch a brave and the bold episode.<br /><br />There are good things in this movie, but don't go in expecting anything above the level of your typical summer blockbuster movie.
1612130283|5.0|Fun book to read...entertaining and informative! Fun  and easy read for the senses.  Definitely leaves you wanting more...buy books 2 and 3!
1844137872|5.0|If you want to see Bansky's work then this is the perfect book.  I like the fact that no one knows who he is and that he's all about the art.  His political messages are right on target and while one or two people may compare him to Blek (Blek le Rat), Bansky is an original.  In a homage to Blek, Bansky once said that whenever he comes up with what he thinks is a new idea, he finds that Blek already did it years ago...but that in no way diminishes Banksy's originality or the huge impact his art is making around the world.  He's fabulous and so is this book.  It's one of my favorites.

B006Y9BVRM|5.0|I bought this as another addition to my SEIKO collection; I have other SEIKO divers (orange monster,additional 200 m SEIKO divers, etc.).  My other solar powered watches are the citizen 300 meter, g-shock (atomic), as well as some others.<br /><br />This is by far the coolest of the bunch, in looks, quality vs. cost, and \\"wow\\" factor.  Yeah, I'm a watch geek, and have around 30 watches, but you just can't beat this watch for value and quality.<br /><br />Dead on accurate (as most quartz watches are); solar charged; size, 200 meter depth rating, good lume, readable dial and registers, and a chronograph function no less!  Even screw down chrono pushers!<br /><br />The only negative is the date window is rather small, and has a black background with white numerals.  A little hard to read with older eyes.<br /><br />Other than that, you need this watch, you want this watch!

I couldn't put it down:)  I am really impressed when a book leaves you with wanting the author to continue the story.

1742200206|3.0|I've always enjoyed the Lonely Planet guides, which are friendly, interesting and updated regularly. I was a little disappointed in this one, which deals with my home town. It has excellent maps, and a great pull-out map that you can use if carrying a book is just too much trouble. But, like too many guides to The Big Apple, it focuses on the core and doesn't offer enough coverage of the outer boroughs. It has a little bit about Queens and Brooklyn, but the Bronx is given less than a page and Staten Island seems to be MIA. The good news is that addresses, phone numbers and websites are given for most places. The meh news is that some of the information is not completely accurate, which makes me wonder just how carefully the author researched or fact-checked. For example, The Strand, a marvelous used bookstore, is given some attention, but the description is partly out of date. Yes, it used to have enormous aisles of half-priced reviewer's copies that took up half the basement, but they were cropped back to just a few aisles. It's kind of hard to miss this change. Also, though the book notes that The Strand buys back books, it states that this is done on weekdays, but it is also done on Saturdays. My advice: this is a useful guide, but check the websites or phone to make sure the information is correct before you head out to enjoy your trip.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|Even though I was not that impressed with this movie, the second one was amazing. Worth watching to prepare yourself for the second movie.
0345803493|5.0|If you are not expecting a literary masterpiece, this book is great! I couldn't stop reading it! It is fan fiction, so expect a good story and an easy, fun read. I loved the love story and found myself totally wrapped up in the characters. Was the book realistic? NO! Do I care? NO! I think I read the trilogy faster than any others I have ever read. It is more like reading a fantasy than novel, so don't expect to relate! Keep an open mind, have a glass of wine and enjoy!

B007KOLNXC|5.0|Mad Men has to be one of the best written and best acted TV shows of all time. From the very first episode of the very first season, my wife and I have been hooked on this series. Even if you weren't born yet during the 50's and 60's, you'll end up loving this show. The characters are unique, and the excessive and overplayed smoking and drinking scenes just add to the effect of this powerful and at times comical series. This show definitely deserves and gets 5 stars from me.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|***Spoiler in my review****I really wanted this movie to be better than other reviewers said it was, but sadly it fell short.  Spectacular effects (as far as the main 'alien' character-though short screen time), but stupid things the characters do that you expect more from.  Seemed more like the film was made for Sy-Fy channel viewing with some of the acting, and the plot was so boring and over done.  I thought it might give some interesting perspective into origins of life, but that stale story of 'alien race bent on killing mankind' is kinda what we're left with.  The additional Giger/Alien characters made me roll my eyes, and though I watched it to the end, I can't say it saved itself anywhere in the movie.  Look elsewhere for interesting insight to creation, how about youtube for starters.  Cause you won't find much here in Prometheus.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|\\"Reflected in You\\" was just as heart-pounding as the first book \\"Bared to You\\" in the Crossfire Series.  It kept you on edge wondering what Gideon was going to do!  I love Fifty Shades of Grey, but I believe that this series is an easy competitor.  There was more struggle between Eva and Gideon in this book, thus giving me more anxiety as to what was going to happen.  I am very excited and looking forward to the conclusion of this trilogy.  Would definitely recommend it!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|MAJOR CLIFF-HANGER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have to admit I cried a bit at the end...Partially because of what happened, and partially because I have to wait until NEXT FALL! UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br />But it's a awesome book, as his books usually are. :)
B0054W4JQK|5.0|This book had me engrossed from the first page. I didn't know quite what to make of it at first, but kept on reading because the plot was developed and the tension increased so subtly I really couldn't put it down.<br />Even though the twist at the end wasn't a complete surprise by then, the way it was handled was very slick and skilful. Can't wait for the next book!
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Strangeland is great!!!  I originally purchased the album to hear \\"Silenced By the Night,\\" because the song has such a uniquely captivating melody; however, I was quickly captivated by other great songs as well, particularly: \\"Starting Line,\\" \\"On the Road,\\" \\"Day Will Come,\\" and \\"You Are Young\\" (in that order of preference).  The songs have beautiful, passionate, positive, and sincere melodies and lyrics.  I listen to this CD the most out of all CD's in my entire collection!  I very highly recommend this album! :)
B0031RS44S|5.0|This book is one of my favourite Reacher novels. Having thought about it this is probably because it features some of Reacher's army colleagues which enables the reader to gain a deeper insight into his past and personality as seen by people who know him. This is a different perspective to that seen in other novels where Reacher is seen  only through the eyes of the strangers he interacts with briefly but intensely.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I have to be honest I hated Bared to You (1st Book in Crossfire Novel) but I did finish it.  A total 50 Shades rip off.  I swore I would not read book #2, but while looking for a book to read I came across Reflected in You.  I figured let me give it a try.  I could not even get through the the first chapter.  I even got a refund!!!!!  TERRIBLE!!!!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Could not put this book down!  The author creates a compelling story that touches on aspects of the human condition at it worst and its best.  There are lines that my kindle said over a thousand people have highlighted.  And incredible author and an amazing story.  It is a mist read
1594202842|5.0|This book was a good read. I live in Hong Kong, am married to a Filipino and am myself a secondary school teacher. We have a 7 year old son. So, parenting is constantly on our minds. There are, I think, plenty of Tiger mothers in Asia.<br /><br />Amy Chua's book is a frank and honest discussion about her trials and tribulations as a tiger mother. It clearly illustrates the difference between western parenting styles where freedom of choice, creativity and individuality and the cornerstones of parenting and the Chinese tiger mother approach which is much stricter and is all about coercion. In the Tiger mother approach failure is not an option and the best grades are demanded and expected. Moreover, the teacher is always correct and should never be questioned. Also, things like sleep-overs, drama and using Facebook for hours on end are all discouraged. However, in the western approach good grades are not essential and if a child is not good at something it's o.k to give up.<br /><br />Which method is more successful? I think that the tiger mother approach has many benefits although some may argue that it is too strict. For example, in the western approach parents are often very lax and children lack discipline. They are allowed to play computer games for hours on end and spend countless hours on their electronic gadgets and are always using Facebook. My own son, through our own and his choice, is learning to play the violin and he loves it. Let's hope that his will continue. He is also not allowed to play computer games, TV is discouraged and he must concentrate on his schoolwork. We don't expect him to get A grades however but we do expect him to do his best for himself. I think Amy Chua was lucky in that she had two very gifted and intelligent children, Sophia and Lulu. Not all children are like this and the Tiger mother approach may not work with them.<br /><br />To sum up, this book was a really good read and I would give it 5 stars as it is controversial and stimulates debate. It is definitely a must read for all parents. The Tiger mother method of parenting may seem to be rather extreme but I think that western parenting has in many cases become too lax and discipline has been ignored with dire consequences for western societies. Indeed, some children in the west do not appreciate their parents and think that the world owes them a living so Western parents can definitely learn from the Tiger mother approach.

B007TK77QE|3.0|Tthis is JK Rowling's first adult novel and has a full cast of both adults and teeenagers. In fact, there are a large number of characters and they and their lives aand living styles are described in great and overdone detail.  This makes for a very long book that does not always hold the attention.<br />It is hard to identify with any specific character as none are particularly likeable and the social situations and issues that arise do more to indicate the author's moral stance than advance the story. There are aspects of a morality tale here with good and evil portrayed in the relationships, there are many issues seething under the skin and some get redemption, some don't.<br />There are many adult stereotypes, however, the teenagers are drawn well suggesting that the author is yet to make the move from her previous writing to the adult audience.

B009LROCJI|5.0|\\"Good composers borrow. Bad composers steal.\\" This quip has been attributed to several different composers. They probably all stole it from each other ... or maybe they borrowed it from each other. I don't know; I'm a bad composer at my best. But, let's talk about this disc. Well ... let's talk about it later.<br /><br />Back in the days before copyrights it was common practice for a composer to take a theme that he/she liked and rework it into a new composition. Bach did it all the time; Wachet Auf, Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor,.. the list could go on too long. Handel not only did this but took it to extremes and actually stole whole works and affixed his name to the original. (He was caught one time and his justification was \\"It was too good for  _____\\" [I've forgotten the plagiarized composer's name. It was no one I had ever heard of.])Well, let's think of Bach and not Handel right now. It was common practice for a composer to do this type of thing. That is what Max Richter has done with Vivaldi's 4 Seasons. It truly is \\"recomposed\\". It is a new work based on the Vivaldi Masterwork. Vivaldi's themes run throughout this new work but it is mostly Max Richter's new composition here.<br /><br />So; you love the original 4 Seasons? Who doesn't? Will you like/love this recomposition? Yes, IF you can accept the use of Vivaldi's 4 Seasons only as a starting point for a new and different composition. If you think Vivaldi's work is carved in stone and should only be played the way he wrote it, do yourself and everyone else within earshot of your kvetching a favor and just stay away from this disc. Personally, I really like it and I'm only on my second listening. Next stop: search the internet and see if I can find a score to buy.

But I have to criticize this book - I'm sorry.<br /><br />I had preordered the book and had been waiting anxiously for a week or so to read this. I'm 28% in & just getting super upset with your writing style. You write with such detail about events where you were not present.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />Ie: when you were in a coma, all the specific details of people holding your hands, the exact time they arrived at the hospital to visit you, people glancing at each other, etc. Or exact words doctors and nurses said to each other while operating on you in the er.<br /><br />It's way too detailed and reads like a fiction novel. Even if you went back and asked everyone what they said, how can people remember with such detail during a chaotic hospital scene?<br /><br />Another passage about talking to your birth mother. I'll quote here:<br /><br />\\"Over the next four hours, first mars, then saturn, then mercury and finally brilliant venus rose in the eastern sky to greet me into this world.\\"<br /><br />These are details from when you were born! I believe in your account of your nde but these types of details make it seem like a movie script. Im sure you looked up your birth time and backtracked positions of the planets - but why do this in a nonfiction book?<br /><br />I'll keep reading and update this review once I'm done but the writing style is really frustrating me so far. Way too cheesy.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|I'll start by saying that I'm a Taylor fan, so I may not exactly be impartial. Also, this album is definitely light on the \\"country\\" side of country-pop. Her lyrics are still beautifully descriptive, in the vein of Speak Now. Yes, the album is about love and boys and breakups, which a lot of people seem to complain about, but it doesn't actually bother me. With that in mind, here is a review of the tracks:<br /><br />State of Grace: (8.5/10) I didn't actually like this song much at first, but it has definitely grown on me. It is a very strong hook for the album, with a much a different feel than Taylor's usual. Out of all of the new sounds she experimented with on \\"Red\\", this is by far the most intriguing to me. It has, dare I say it, alt-rock roots, which is not anything I would expect from her.<br /><br />Red: (9/10) I have to say that I love, love, love the lyrics to this song. The verses are so vivid that her emotion is tangible. However, the auto tuned part of the chorus was a semi-deal breaker--otherwise, it would have been a perfect ten.<br /><br />Treacherous: (10/10) Gahhh I love this song so much. I've had it on repeat. Once again, Taylor is at her songwriting best, and this song has a Speak Now-ish feel--but with more maturity. She isn't a teenager anymore, and out of every song on this album, I think this one exhibits that fact the most. \\"I can't decide if it's a choice/getting swept away\\"<br /><br />I Knew You Were Trouble: (6/10) There's no denying that this song is catchy, and it will probably be a big hit. That being said, the chords and vocals are not at their strongest. I don't hate the lite dub step as much as I thought I would, but I don't necessarily want to hear much more of this sound for Taylor.<br /><br />All Too Well: (9/10) Every time I listen to this song, I like it a little bit more. It is something of a throwback to her earlier stuff--it seems like a more polished Fearless. But that's precisely what makes this song more effective--it isanother one that shows that she has, in fact, grown up a bit since then.<br /><br />22: (2/10) I really, really don't like this song. Her vocals are at a clear low for the album, and the lyrics/message are equally substandard. I blame Max Martin, and pray that he has nothing to do with the next album.<br /><br />I Almost Do: (6/10) This one is somewhat forgettable to me, and more of the same, but still good.<br /><br />We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together: (7/10) I like this song much more than I have any right to. Another Max Martin, I highly doubt that it will go down as one of her best songs. But it sure as hell is fun, and the humorous lyrics and talking bits make it an interesting fist-pumping pop anthem.<br /><br />Stay Stay Stay: (5/10) This song isn't particularly anything; it isn't good, it isn't bad. Neither the lyrics nor the chords are terribly complex, but is another catchy dance song. I feel like it would have fit in perfect on one of her earlier albums, like Fearless, when she still had the excuse of teendom for the cutesy feel.<br /><br />The Last Time: (10/10) When I first heard this song, I just loved it. Her vocals are reminiscent of Safe and Sound, and I love Gary Lightbody as well. The strings make it so atmospheric. Musically, this is the most intricate song on the album.<br /><br />Holy Ground: (8/10) I thought this would be a slow, sad song by the name, but it is quite the opposite. It has a get-up-and-dance feel, highlighting the fun flirtiness of a failed relationship.<br /><br />Sad, Beautiful Tragic: (4/10) Well, I knew there would be a token depressing ballad, and this would definitely be it. She sounds good, don't get me wrong, but honestly, this song just bores me.<br /><br />The Lucky One: (10/10) This song fascinates me. It tells the story of Hollywood dreams and stars, from the point of view of somebody who knows the game well. It is arguably the only song on the album that doesn't focus on a relationship. The lyrics also have something of a weathered strength, contributing to the overall maturity of this album.<br /><br />Everything Has Changed: (9/10) As soon as I heard that Ed Sheeran was co-writing a song for \\"Red\\", I legitimately freaked. He is one of my favorite artists at the moment. This song doesn't disappoint. I read somewhere that they wrote this on a trampoline with a guitar, and I can easily picture that. It tells the story of a sweet flirtationship in an earthy, carefree way.<br /><br />Starlight: (6/10) This is another \\"meh\\" song for me. It is wholly unremarkable and echoes many of Taylor's previous songs.<br /><br />Begin Again: (10/10) Perfectly ends the album with a hopeful note-- both thematically and musically.<br /><br />Bonus Tracks:<br />The Moment I Knew (6/10) Typically, familiarly Taylor, this song sounds like it maybe missed the cut for a previous album.<br /><br />Come Back...Be Here: (7/10) Ultimately forgettable, but it's sweet and the emotional desperation translates across to us. I also quite like the last chorus with the hand-clapping instrumentation.<br /><br />Girl At Home: (8/10) This one is super catchy, with a positive no-cheating message for girls. It details Taylor's frustration with a somewhat slimy guy who is hitting on her, despite his \\"girl at home\\".<br /><br />Treacherous Demo Version: Not sure how to rate this one, because it sounds virtually the same as the album version. It does have slightly different instrumentation, which I do like a bit.<br /><br />Red Demo Version: Besides a slightly longer introduction and a different drum rhythm, this also sounds basically the same. I prefer the album version.<br /><br />State of Grace Acoustic: (9/10) LOVE this version. It works perfectly as an accompaniment piece to the original, and the quiet, simple chords showcase Taylor's voice.<br /><br />Overall, I will say that this album is pretty much great, but there are some notable detriments. It is one part more of the same, and one part something completely new. Some of her risks pay off, but some do not at all. I have a feeling that some critics will say that this album is all over the place, which it is at points. I feel like in order to get that perfect five star review (from me at least), Taylor is going to have to figure out what, exactly, she wants to be, and commit to it. Her maturity exudes from certain tracks, but there are a few that are annoyingly teen-ish.<br /><br />But don't get me wrong--I know, without a doubt, that I will have this album on repeat for quite some time.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|This is an excellent show, love the instant video option for amazon.  We watched the first four seasons on netflix and of course didn't want to wait to see the latest season.
B005FISBV2|5.0|DEXTER IS A UNIQUE SHOW. CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT EPISODE COMES. KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. CHARACTERS ARE DEVELOPED VERY WELL. PRICE WAS RIGHT. ITEM IN PERFECT COND. CAN'T WAIT TO SEE SEASON 7.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Quiet is a brilliant book and should be read by all who have equated introversion with inferiority, something that needs to be overcome.  It shows how culturally we have been fed the idea that extroverts are superior people; after all, there is profit in teaching people how to act like or become extroverted.<br /><br />Quiet also brings out how other cultures value introversion.  It is an empowering read.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|im so glad thar i downloaded this awesome app! its just the right one for me!!! download it if you are creative and want to build your own inventions easily. my fav. game of all times. love it.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|Everyone who has kids or is thinking about having kids should read this book.  It is written in a clear way but with substantial academic back-up.  Recommend highly.
B007THA4FI|5.0|It was difficult at first to get used to the language and situations used by the Harry Potter author!  Once I let that go, it was a very enjoyable well-written book.  I recommend this book but would caution against letting children read the book.  Teens to young adult ages- it depends.
1416583432|4.0|Very entertaining and easy read with some funny stories that helped to understand what it must be like to be a dog in our world. Deep background into wolves to dogs and how that probably came about. Interesting stuff that helps to understand that dogs experience world thru nose, while we experience world primarily thru eyes.<br /><br />Some of the conclusions I think are false, but that's no reason to not enjoy the book.<br /><br />Spoiler alert.<br />She talks about experiments where owners faked heart attacks or other serious problems, and dogs didn't respond in heroic manner, and concludes that dogs are not heroic. But says earlier that dogs can tell minute changes in order and behavior, so I conclude that dogs are smart enough to know their owner is playing, and is not in serious danger.<br /><br />Still nice book for people with or without dogs.
B000063UR2|5.0|This is a favorite of mine from my childhood. I love this movie and was so glad that I found it on here!  As with other movies I've ordered from other sellers, the shipping time was a little long but again that's fine.  I knew it would be a while, they give you an estimate on shipping.  What was important was the condition of the movie when it arrived which was excellent.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Definitely Not the best book I've ever read, but i had so much fun.  Not to be read by people under 18 years of age.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|This movie was absolutely terrible! I can't understand why people actually liked it. Boring from start to finish with a terrible pace. I don't recommend it...
B00991TCOG|5.0|I love dubstep and electronic music. I also love classical music. This combines both into one amazing mixture. The music is both beautiful and awesome at the same time. Seriously, this CD does not have a bad song. If you haven't listened to it yet, go to youtube right now! You will probably be returning to buy the CD. This is one of the few CDs I feel is worth ripping to my itunes, then placing on my ipod in a lossless format.
B004MPESSY|4.0|The name of the movie made it seem like it was going to be super cheesy. Sure, it is a bit cheesy, but it's actually a well-done horror flick.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|its fun and very hard and thats exactly what i love angry birds is just to easy and kinda boring this is something totally worth it i would recomend in a heart beat!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|only about 10 status updates load correctly, after that they're blue blocked and will not load. i also can not &quot;like&quot; anything. app works great on my android cellphone just not on my Kindle Fire HD. major  bummer... please fix!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|this app is great for buying cheap stuff u can also find things on here that might not be in any store near you.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I so wanted to like this movie.  But it was so slow and boring. The costumes were great but all the funny parts were given away in the previews. Save this one for a day when you've watched everything else and don't waste a dime on it. And this is coming from a girl who will watch practically any bad movie.
B0044KI79S|5.0|I watched this season quickly - had to so I could see what would come next! The boys being so handsome didn't hurt either!  And I love the car!
B0047DVHV2|4.0|No holds barred from this legendary rocker! You'll find new respect for this artist as he takes you along on his journey with one of the legendary bands of our era! I couldn't put it down!
B007M45PMU|5.0|The song, \\"Hey Ho\\", was the first I'd heard of the Lumineers, and I love that song!  The entire album is unusal and great.  I'm glad I made the purchase!
B0013TTLDE|5.0|A little predictable here and there . . . yet has some twists I certainly did not expect.  I found myself enjoying the slow pace of Grace's story.  The meter of the tale, coupled with Grace's age, helped to immerse me in the time and surroundings.  I love Kate Morton's writing style.  This is one book, one author, not to be missed!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great app, gladly paid for it. My time spent texting has gone down and the more I do text the more it learns and predicts what I'm going to say next
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was amazing. Some parts almost got me pregnant. Lolx! Christian Grey is a plum mess but i love him all the same.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|Short and to the point, its not the best book in the entire series, but it maybe the worst. The author Rick Riordan at his worst is still a better story teller than 95% of other writers out there. To me the complaint I had is the story seems very disjointed in this book. In previous books the story just flowed effortlessly from start to finish. A good read, with you wanting to know what happens to Percy and company sooner than next fall.
0545123275|4.0|Summary: Grace had been watching the wolves behind her house for years. When a naked boy with a gunshot wound arrives on her steps, her suspicions are confirmed. She recognized one set of eyes through all of the years. Her wolf was really an eighteen year old boy. And now that they met, they want to find  a way to make him human, as this is the last time he will shift to a human form.<br /><br />Writing style: This book was a bit hard to read for me as it was like having little conversations. There were not more than a page or two at most in one person's perspective and then it switched. I felt a little scattered reading it and then found it could be hard to follow at times. It took much longer than most books for me to get into it.<br /><br />The werewolf theme: This is yet another new take on the werewolf theme. Here it is presented as a disease that affects them when they shiver- or rather get cold. They keep their human eyes, so that was unique also. Biting humans and the fascination of the main character with the abnormal was not new.<br /><br />OVERALL: GOOD book. I enjoyed it, though I did find at times it was a difficult read jumping around in everyone's minds all the time.
B004TSKKE0|2.0|While the story is interesting, the language is so complicated that I as a non-native English speaker has a problem getting into the flow of reading and therefore the book becomes somewhat a struggle to get through. I had to give up.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is lots of fun and very addicting.  I found myself checking it all the time!  Would like it more if you could complete the challenges without asking neighbors.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great app it is really fun and is really a mystery great app it is fun and fun to figure out the
B002MQYOFW|5.0|like everyone sooo likes this freaking  book lol('0') i guess i like this amazing book so much! i am so reading the rest of the series! thanks suzz! love ya!
B009DP9D6A|4.0|I really do u like the most of the songs but theres a few were im not q big fan of. Thats why im giving 4 out of 5 stars but for the most part most of the songs i really enjoyed so it was worth it and i would recommend it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|get both of the block games cus they are both fun and entertaining. I have both and i am never board when i play on my kind. fire.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mystery/legal thriller readers anticipate Grisham's books.  With 'The Racketeer' he doesn't disappoint.  Malcolm Bannister is serving ten years in prison for a RICO violation - a sentence he believes he received at the hand of an overly ambitious federal prosecutor.  When a federal judge is murdered along with his young secretary, Malcolm sees his ticket out.  Malcolm knows who did it, and why.<br /><br />Malcolm follows the investigation and when it is obvious the FBI has no clue as to the identity of the killer he offers the name and the motive for his freedom and a new identity.<br /><br />Grisham builds the suspense from page 1 - Malcolm's prison life is not terrible (he is serving time at a minimum security campus) but freedom is his obsession.  What price will he pay, indeed, what price would any of us pay?  Malcolm must stay one step ahead of the men he is manipulating. He must coordinate his plan with his limited resources and obvious disadvantage.<br /><br />The story is compact, the prose compelling and the reader must pay attention.  A can't put down page turner.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B000FC1CYG|5.0|This is an amazing book. In the style of books written back then, it was a perfect example of neat writing and careful planning. This story was told from different points-of-view throughout and it was excellently executed. I enjoyed it immensely.
B00884GR0W|4.0|this app is very close to mine craft and i really wish that they had mine craft for kindle fire its so freshtrating that they dont have mine ctaft this game is pretty fun and really close to minecraft so i give it 4 stars
B00127RAJY|5.0|First of all, I don't know if anyone will read this review since there are like 2000 reviews. But...... this video is seriously worth the few dollars it costs. Now, to clarify, I am the weakest female on earth. I can run 14 miles easily, but give me a pair of dumb-bells and I am ready to pass out after a few reps. To make matters worse, I have a hate-hate relationship with home workout videos. They bring back bad memories of my mom bouncing around in the living room to a very pregnant Kathy Smith. I just wanted to watch cartoons, geesh mom. Anyway, so back to the video. I decided off a whim to purchase this. I am not sure why, I think maybe someone on a blog recommended it. I figured 20 minutes of my life isn't too much.<br /><br />I tried this video for the first time and was utterly amazed. I didn't realize you could really be so sore from 20 minutes of exercise. I am the cardio queen, and even after 2 hours of working out I rarely feel sore (I know, I should exert myself more). This video kicked my trash. However, it was just intense enough for me to keep up. I felt like everything was doable (except the push-ups, I am working on that). Some workout videos are great in theory, but if you go into cardiac arrest after 5 minutes they lose their effectiveness. So, this video is just the right combination of intensity and reality. And, best of all, it really does shape your body. In all the right places. Try it, you will love it!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Absolutely loved this book - it has quickly become one of my all time favorites.  Can't wait for the 3rd book to come out !!!
1451695195|5.0|I received this book today and read it in one afternoon. I read Dr. Alexander's article in a medical journal a few months ago and have been looking forward to the expanded version in his forthcoming book. I found the book compelling in the very fact that he was unable to put into words much of what he experienced--even though he is a talented storyteller. His vision of \\"God,\\" especially a God who is love, confirms so much of my life experience. I have noticed that many times on Amazon when a book receives one or two stars, it is from someone who has read a book and it does not confirm their pre-conceived \\"Jesus Saves\\" view of life. I let go of the Satan mythology long ago and I appreciated how Eben explained evil and the age old question of \\"why.\\" If some reviewers see this as a \\"New Age\\" book, then that is a good thing, because it is a new age and it demands new paradigms for looking at the world. The recent Pew Study on religion shows that our children's generation is in dire need of those willing to share their experiences and show us the way to a better more tolerant world. Thank you, Dr. Alexander for the gift of healing and the gift of love you are sharing with the world. I will certainly be sharing this with my children and grandchildren.
B009HXGD4S|5.0|One of the greatest movies of the year.  Outstanding acting, script and camera work (some of the shots are truly wonderful).  Just give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed.
0345803485|2.0|I am a constant reader and lack a local bookstore. Sometimes, I have to settle for the sad excuse of the literary section of Walmart when I find myself in a bookless pinch. Everyone on the planet has told me I have to read this book, it will blow your mind. I avoided the bandwagon until now. I decided give it a try. The story I enjoyed and I liked the characters but I can assure you my mind is intact, though I might have to read some Isaac Asimov just to remind myself I'm still a smart woman.<br /><br />That being said, the writing is horrible. I don't care how good a \\"story\\" is if the language and writing are bad, the story is ruined for me. I was ready to give up in the middle but I kept on because I can't leave a book unfinished. By the last few pages of running hands through each others hair, pulling, tangling, twisting, smelling, and nuzzling I was ready to drown the book in my bathtub. I'm surprised either one of them had any hair left at the end. The sexual situations become so predictable I started skipping them. If all the repetitiveness was edited out this novel would have been a short story. I don't think I needed to read the rules of the contract three times. I got it on the first go around. Lastly, I noticed typos and important words to a sentence just left out.<br /><br />However, if you don't mind all that. You will like it. When I tried to ignore it I did actually enjoy the story.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is great!  I loved Fifty Shades of Grey so I knew I would love this book.  It has a darker story behind the characters and adds to the tension and the plot.
B007NU54H4|5.0|This is by far the best of Tinkerbell films to be made.  The DVD include among the bonus area a pair of music videos, the first time I believe a pixie preview short is place on a DVD and the made-for-TV special Pixie Hollow Games.  I once heard that only four Tinkerbell movies were planned but this video also has a preview for a new Tinkerbell movie coming out in the Spring where Tink and her friend have an accident that results in them swapping powers and abilities.<br /><br />The movie itself I think is the best Tinkerbell movie made yet.  Like the first Tinkerbell movie we have Tink as curious now about the winter woods as she once was about the main land and just as much want to visit there. When Fawn need help herding animals there she thought she had her chance to explore. Just when her wings start to glow, Fawn pulls her back and tell her its against fairy law for Winter fairies to cross over to their side or warm fairies to cross over into winter. AS she tries to learn more about why her wings glowed she decide to stow away on the next owl pick up to the winter woods after re-designing the outfit she wore in Lost Treasure for winter warmth. It is there that she meets her sister and find out how much alike they are. Being sisters when their wings are put together they have a secret power no fairy has ever seen before.  The two work together with a plan to try to convince the Lord of Winter and Queen Cleareon to resin the law about crossing over which like most of Tinkerbell's plans get worst before things get better.
B0072OFM28|4.0|Just what I expected from the producer and main characters, should have had more episodes though.looking forward to the next spartugus coming in Jan 2013.
B009MO5G90|3.0|One of the biggest setbacks to following a film during its production is that there's to be little to no surprise in the final product after you've indulged yourself in the tidbits the actors and production like to give its fans. Fortunately and unfortunately, \\"Resident Evil\\" as a franchise has never been one for maintaining surprise (either as game or a film) and thus the only real drawback is knowing what order the scenes will happen.<br /><br />[True to form, \\"Resident Evil: Retribution\\" gets off to a promising start by picking up where \\"[[ASIN:B004DTXJ4S Resident Evil: Afterlife]] (2010)\\" left of with the incursion of Umbrella gunships converging on the ship captured by Alice (Milla Jovovich), Claire (Ali Larter) and Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller).<br /><br />However, instead of a straightforward action sequence, we get a literal flashback in reverse wherein Alice emerges from the icy waters of the Los Angeles bay and fails to fend off the hordes of Umbrella soldiers --- lead by Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) --- as they lay siege to the ship, killing and capturing all in their path. Alice reintroduces the story of the original, second, third and fourth films to us once more in a video confessional and the story begins again with Alice waking from a dream in a cushy bedroom, married to Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) with a deaf daughter named Becky (Aryana Engineer).<br /><br />She lives the good life until their home is besieged by Las Plaga Undead in a scene straight out of Zack Snyder's \\"[[ASIN:B002NWOI0G Dawn of the Dead]] (2004)\\". She and her daughter manage to evade death long enough to encounter a suburban Rain Ocampo (Michelle Rodriguez) who rescues them from the horde only to be blindsided by a truck. Alice later wakes up in a white room and is interrogated by a brainwashed Jill Valentine demanding to know why she betrayed Umbrella.<br /><br />During a lull, the Umbrella facility she's being held in loses power and she is allowed the chance to escape,armed to the teeth with weaponry and a new outfit. On the outside she meets special agent Ada Wong (Li Bingbing, dubbed over by someone who is vaguely reminiscent of Ada's voice actress in \\"Resident Evil 4\\") who reveals to her who's pulling the strings of the clandestine biohazard operation.]<br /><br />In the aftermath of \\"[[ASIN:B000YPUF9W Resident Evil: Extinction]] (2007)\\" and \\"Resident Evil: Afterlife\\" there were plenty of criticisms from the franchise's fanbase that these two entries into the franchise moved too slowly and suffered from \\"too little action\\" (or too much Alice brooding in silence) and \\"too much talk\\" if that's remotely possible for this franchise. There were of course promises to rectify this problem, but if \\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Extinction\\" are the equivalent of a zombie-action film that movies too slow, \\"Retribution\\" is the zombie-action film that drops too much and moves too fast for the sake of appeasing its audience.<br /><br />Where dropping you into the middle of a story worked on some level in the original \\"[[ASIN:B000MPEIF6 Resident Evil]] (2002)\\", \\"Retribution\\" suffers from a lack of any kind of substantial background. Once Alice is freed from her imprisonment in the White Room, each scene following unfolds more like a series of music video sequences with some excellent fight choreography as opposed to the natural progression of scenes that compliment one after the other with a coherent narrative.<br /><br />On top of that, there are elements that pertain to Alice and Ada being rescued from the underwater Umbrella base by the likes of Leon Kennedy (Johann Urb), Barry Burton (Kevin Durand), Luther West (Boris Kodjoe) and two nameless men destined for cannon fodder that was an un-shot portion of the film unto itself. Team \\"Gorgeous Men with Guns\\" were hired by Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts) to infiltrate the Umbrella base and bring Alice back to the surface, but it's mentioned in passing and their introduction feels largely like a scene that was chopped down into almost nothing.<br /><br />And that's what a great deal of this film feels like: A longer or at least mildly more substantial film than the one unfolding on the screen before our eyes that was clearly cut down for running time reasons. While the dialog was never a shining achievement in screenwriting, the chosen scenes in which our characters interact or merely exposition dump for sake of the remaining plot feel poorly chosen and directed, especially in comparison to previous endeavors of the franchise. Pacing moves at breakneck speed and thus decisions made in regards to the film's narrative tend to beg to the question \\"Uh why did that just happen?\\"<br /><br />For one instance, of all the people or things that could've taken control of and kept Umbrella running in the face of a global apocalypse and extinction of the human race, why the Red Queen? Why not William Birkin or someone else the video game placed into a position power beside Albert Wesker? The Red Queen as a antagonist doesn't work because we're never given a reason for her motivations let alone why she is even still alive after being nuked by the very company that created her (unless she's a 2.0 version of her program). Plus her presence simply begs the question that will never be answered, \\"well, what happened to the White Queen?\\" Is she still active in Nevada working on Alice's miracle Anti-Virus or was she deactivated? Why exactly are Albert Wesker and Ada Wong not working for Umbrella anymore? The Red Queen hardly seems like a challenge for someone who has apparently gained control of his superhuman abilities, let alone a plausible roadblock to deter him from doing whatever he wanted in the face of the world's extinction or better yet, fixing the problem as he seems intent on doing as President Albert Wesker (pause for effect).<br /><br />How do Ada Wong and Leon Kennedy know each other, why does he trust her and so on and so forth? There's a whole unexplored element on the power of Umbrella's reach and the nature of how the clones are used and treated as test subjects that's glossed over. Becky, the daughter of \\"Suburban Alice\\" (a clone), brings up a rather interesting plot point in the story that is never used at all and sloppily executed.<br /><br />It's clear that Anderson wanted to pay homage to \\"[[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]]\\" with the relationship between Becky and Alice and it's nice to watch Jovovich and Aryana interact, but outside of some sweet and silly moments between the two, nothing really comes of it. It's normal things like that this I'm usually able to ignore because on some level Anderson never left them completely unanswered or at least covered the questions of the plot right in front of him better than this. The Red Queen just feels like a severe left turn into a wall as a result of writing oneself into a narrative rock and a hard place after removing your primary antagonist from the \\"villain\\" stable.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me was how certain characters died, or rather, how they were utilized. The clones of \\"One\\" (Colin Salmon), Carlos and Rain are used to very little effect and are cameos at best. They speak infrequently and never really interact with each other on any level. Worst of all they end up dying in ways they reflect how unnecessary they were to the overall film. Their roles could've been filled in by any nameless mook and there would be little difference.<br /><br />\\"Evil Rain\\" is exploited as the primary boss battle in the climax of the film, spouting off awkward one-liners like \\"I'm coming for you!\\" while she beats the ever-loving crap out of Leon and Luther like they were mere punching bags. The only redeeming factor in how she's used is the truly fitting underwater death scene she gets. \\"Good Rain\\" was probably one of the highlights of the film, showcasing Rodriguez's 'feminine side' as she portrays a \\"vegan eating, anti-gun protester\\" that wears stiletto heels you never really see inthe film.<br /><br />Unfortunately the character is killed off just as soon as she begins to do anything in the film. The same happens with Barry Burton. The character is barely put to any good use before he's pointlessly killed off for a dramatic ploy that never pays off in the end because you never got to know him. I even had to question why the two nameless guys that followed Leon and co. were there. It was just so apparent that they weren't necessary that I ask again \\"why are they there?\\" There's no risk or drama involved for our protagonists, its obvious that these guys are going to die, but why do it so quickly? The minor characters in \\"Afterlife\\" were treated better than this. Boris Kodjoe's Luther West --- one of the best parts of \\"Afterlife\\" --- is used about as well as Barry and the returning dead characters.<br /><br />His own death scene is so egregious and unimportant that I found myself grinding my teeth at the waste of such a capable and interesting character. After all that build up, that's what he gets (Carlos got a better send off in \\"Extinction\\")? Jill Valentine as the villain is underused as well, showcased in scenes with some truly stilted dialog that sounds spliced together and purposely distorted. The only saving grace in regards to her is that she also gets an impressive fight sequence with Alice and survives to possibly fall back into a useful character she was in \\"[[ASIN:B000I8ES70 Resident Evil: Apocalypse]] (2004)\\".<br /><br />Performances are for the most part okay; Li Bingbing and Johann Urb do serviceable jobs with the material given and truly embody the characters of Leon Kennedy and Ada Wong with what face time they're given in the movie, including that awkward romance angle that's barely touched upon in the games as well --- albeit in a throwaway scene that gets a chuckle or two. Milla Jovovich remains consistent as the super heroine Alice, throwing her physical everything into the roll with the ease of a practiced stuntwoman. At the same time she portrays a not-so-helpless scream queen soccer mom with just as much believability.<br /><br />Kevin Durand on the other hand is barely given anything to work with as Barry. He does his 'best' with character quirks (cigars, crouching in the face of death and one liners), but he just comes off as the weak link in a franchise with above-average performances and you know this man can act (particularly when he's the antagonist of a film). Boris Kodjoe and Michelle Rodriguez keep an upbeat and steely consistency with their characters; Boris, however misused he was, is still a joy to watch as Luther, the basketball star turned hero and fleeting love interest for Alice. Michelle is at her most entertaining when she's fighting or playing the flip side of her machinegun touting warrior woman. I can believe her as a conservative young woman voting for gun control and refusing to eat food with a face.<br /><br />Fight choreography, special and practical effects maintain their usual consistency (i.e., they were awesome). The use of popular BOWs like the Licker, Las Plagas and the Axeman (Executioner Majini) make for some fantastic action sequences, but they're unfortunately dispensed as easily as zombies. The hand-to-hand combat scenes are the best of the franchise. For once, you can see what's happening in the fight and it's clear that the actors (stunt people and production team) put their all into selling these fights as the genuine article, albeit stretched to the impossible lengths by movie logic. The film is beautiful to look at, the cinematography is at its strongest here since \\"Extinction\\". Even when the film shifts from on-location to studio shots the quality of the scenery remains consistent. However, its only mildly complemented by [IMAX] 3D which is used very little or so subtly that it's not always in your face until they want to spook the audience with something flying at the screen. On that level I can appreciate Anderson's ability to restrain hisself and not going overboard with the 3D like most directors tend to do. The only real flub I could complain about is the noticeable miniature set pieces used in wide shots. It was like looking at someone's homemade film with a sheet of Hollywood gloss. That little car toy and submarine were so painfully visible.<br /><br />The score by tomandandy is something of a hit-and-miss; it's primarily a rehash of the \\"Afterlife\\" score and its popular themes (\\"Flying\\" - \\"Tokyo\\" - \\"Axman\\"), with only one strong reoccurring motif playing throughout the film (\\"Flying through the Air\\") complimented by a grandiose piece that suits the half finale given before the movie truly ends (\\"Zombies Under Ice\\"). Otherwise the duo's score suits the frenetic pace of the film and does a serviceable job in the background.<br /><br />Overall, despite my problems with \\"Retribution\\", I enjoyed watching this. As far an action/chase film goes, it excels in spades and never lets us on that level. Narratively, however, it's a dang mess. My opinion is of course subject to change as I've only just seen this movie a couple hours ago, but I did enjoy it even when I was continually asking \\"why this\\" and \\"why that?\\" If you're a fan of the Resident Evil Movieverse, then by all means check this out. If not, do please avoid it at all costs, you'll only give yourself a headache. [a 3 out of 5]
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it so much its so adicting I play it every day.  really good app.  so much fun.<br /><br />awesome
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Visually very good; great special effects.  That's it.  Not the fault of the actors either.  It moved very slowly, was boring, characters were boring and it felt as though it dragged on and on.
B008OW1SAC|3.0|I really love this album, and love to collect vinyl.  Buts lets face it, its the 21st Century and MP3's are nice to download for use in cars, iPods, etc.  When I ordered this album, it said that an MP3 download card was included and it WAS NOT!  This card contains remixes that the Amazon MP3 download of the album does not.  Also, I have to pay for it.  I'm disgusted to say the least.
B00932A2MC|3.0|Battleship was a decent movie. The story was a little light, but the action was good. Nothing great to say, but nothing really bad to say.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this app, as I am a seamstress and always carry a tape measure with me in my purse, but this app really takes the pressure off when I'm in line waiting for fabrics to be cut...no holding up the line when figuring yardage and it keeps me from over-buying. This is a great little helper! And wait-there's more! The numbers are BIG and easy to read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I cannot put this book down!  It has so many twists and turns that keep you reading. I can't wait to see how it all turns out!  Highly recommend.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Seriously. The best series I have read in a really long time. 50 shades darker is twice the book one is only in the fact it actually  puts more of a plot. Just as much sex but a lot more plot. Then when you finally make it to freed. It is amazing. The plots get wild and still just as much craziness as the first two. Love the series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is by far the best calculator app on my kindle Fire, Nook, and Android. Everyone should have Calculator Plus to help with their math problems. Highly recommended especially for teachers!
B0092MDGBM|5.0|I absolutely love this show.  I try to watch at least one episode on the weekends but trying to stretch it out, I can't get enough.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really love this game! I just wish you could get more energy in different ways. The graphics are great and I have enjoyed playing. Glad I found it for free!  It is worth the download. I recommend this game.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Highly addictive game! you'll just want it to keep going. I got into this Tv show because of my daughter and this game is just as entertaining. If you like thinking and strategy games, you'll love this game.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These three books are all nicely written, have a great story line, and will make you blush at times.  I was disappointed when I finished the third book because they were all so good.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Excellent audio.  Excellent cinema photography techniques. It's nice to watch the video produced with scene continuity rather than rapid fire, split second clips.
B00004RF9G|5.0|I first saw Brigadoon in the movie theater, then live at an off-Broadway theater.  This DVD is very well done, the photography is perfectly reproduced, and it's wonderful to see the original cast performing it again!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed this more than the movie. It was good to know what her inner thoughts were the whole time. It made her actions in the movie more clear.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|The book and the one that precedes it show beyond a doubt that George R. R. (Read-on, Read-on) Martin is out of ideas.  This \\"saga\\" might as well have ended with the Red Wedding.  Each chapter is like an episode in a soap opera.  It just grinds on with no apparent direction.  When he is totally devoid of imagination, Mr. Martin resorts to gratuitous obscenity and sex.  This is recurring with increasing frequency.  I'm not sure I'm even interested in how this story ends, if it ever does.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|The animation and music in this movie are great, other than that, typical Disney princess formula. Princess is unhappy with her lot in life that is better than 98% of the peasants that are around her castle. An adult is making her unhappy, often a parent or step parent. Eventually princess shows some remorse and understanding, but gets her way after causing a lot of chaos. Yawn.... Oh yes, there is as always some kind of villain creeping around, in this case a bear.<br /><br />Also there is some nudity and a young boy that looks like a small bear diving down the front of a woman's dress - great kid fare, right?<br /><br />The best part of this movie at least for me was the witch - oh and the Pixar short \\"La Luna\\" that was before it - now that was a show of real creativity and imagination!
B008673ZAQ|4.0|This book stressed me out in a lot of parts, but I think that's exactly what the author wanted to achieve. And she did it well. By the end of the book I loved every minute of this story. Can't wait for the third book to come out!
0761163808|5.0|This book will appeal to all ages. Ms Kaufmanns writings about safari will touch the most experienced Africa traveler and the wonderful photo effects will inspire others to visit the most beautiful continent. My husband and I were lucky enough to meet her briefly at Leleshwa Camp and can testify to the her sense of awe brought on by time on safari!
B00846REIS|4.0|I didn't love this book at first, but as the story went on and the characters developed, I grew to like it more and more. I read the second one right away and I can't wait for the third book to come out!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|i Am a Big Fan Of Angry Birds....Now This Came Out And All My Dreams Came True...I Recommend This Game
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Can't stop listening to their music.  The arrangements are innovative, the timing, collaboration and synergy of these 5 talented artists is totally entertaining. I totally recommend this!
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|I loved this app sooooo much. I had about 43,000 coins. But then all my money got reset. So if one of the game makers is reading this, please give me 43,000 coins. Also it sucks that when I got 50,000 coins I was going to go on a shopping spree.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I used to be a military court reporter, so court type reading \\"grabs me,\\" but what I liked the most about this is the horrible situation this man found himself, i.e., his son was accused of murder and here he was an assistant district attorney.  I mean here he had prosecuted so many criminals in his life .... and now . . . oh my God, his son! The other thing that particularly held my interest was the possibility of a murder gene . . . now that DNA is being such a huge part of our lives . . . and here was being presented to himself and his family the possibility that he harbored this inward part of himself that he had a bad seed gene and perhaps he and his wife had birthed a murderer.  I won't say any more except I had to read it all the way through to its very unexpected ending.  I hope this man writes more and more.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|When I picked up this omnibus I was completely unprepared for the story to take me in the way it did.  From the very first section the writing accomplished giving me an insight into the characters In order to connect with them and be deeply vested in what was going to happen.  The unexpected twists made me stay up to continue reading the story.  I will not include anything especific about the story as anything I said would detract from your experience as a reader. If you are a scifi  / post apocalyptic world fan then do yourself a favor and get \\"wool\\".
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Cant say that I like this book very much - maybe it is just not type of book but was quite disappointed.
B005HEX8QC|4.0|'Lineage' is one of (if not, the only) surprisingly great episodes of season seven. It drops all the space battles, anomalies, and technobabble for a rich story centered on B'elanna's anxieties about her daughter's future.<br /><br />One of BLT's best character traits has been the fact that she perceives her Klingon heritage as a burden, instead of a source of strength. It's given her problems all her life, so much so that it clouds all the positives that have come from it. Those positives aren't enough though, as she tries to find a way through genetic manipulation to change her daughter's fate by extracting all the Klingon.<br /><br />She fears that her new family will be in shambles as her daughter goes through the same problems she did growing up. She doesn't want to lose her new family. It's great to watch Dawson grapple with these scenes. McNeill is also great, trying to comfort her, while also fighting for his own daughter's right to her heritage. This all leads to a conclusion that feels earned and satisfying.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Dawson and McNeill. 'Lineage' cements these two as one of Star Trek's best couples and an element Voyager got right.<br /><br />- B'elanna's request to the Doctor for his role in her baby's life. Really sweet scene.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- It seems to be way too easy to re-write the Doctor's program. What happened to those safe guards Seven of Nine talked about implementing at the end of 'Equinox - Part II'?
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The moment i started reading this book i did not want to put it down. i was intrigued by travis' bad boy behavior and abby's mysterious past. all hamds down and amazing book!
B005HEX1GO|3.0|'Repentance' has heart, but is hampered by the some of the clich&eacute;s Voyager is infested with.<br /><br />Voyager picks up a group of condemned criminals and volunteers to help escort them after their original ship breaks down. Hauling some guys to their executions suck, but Janeway and crew don't want to break the Prime Directive with this species (Voyager has gotten to the point where they don't even bother to come up with names for all the new foreheads they meet). One of the more violent convicts, Iko, turns out to have the node in his brain broken, which is then fixed (nano-probes), and he becomes a murderer with a heart of gold.<br /><br />Iko has become a new man, who understands what he has done was wrong and he never wants to do anything like it again. Yet, he still committed murder and the family wants him dead, even if he's no harm to anyone now. It's quite an ethical dilemma and it leads to some good scenes between Doc, Seven, and the Iko.<br /><br />What is irritating though, is that it feels undercut by Voyager's clich&eacute; shortcomings. Another alien species with hyper strict laws that the crew can butt heads with. Neelix getting suckered by an OK dude who might not be. The Doctor getting all up in peoples faces about ethics. The G.D. Prime Directive.<br /><br />This episode has moments to like, but that's it.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Jeff Kober as Iko. He has the acting skill of Ron Perlman and the presence of a WWE wrestler.<br /><br />- Seven of Nine speaking out loud about her crimes and regrets from when she was full Borg. How does one carry the burden of ending thousands of lives?<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- Hard to tell by the end what to actually think about the ethics brought up. Maybe that's the point, or the science behind Kober's rehabilitation never felt legit enough.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This book was amazing. i read this book for battle of the books for school . now that i was introduced to this series i am planning to read the rest of the books. i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read about a daring  romantic jaw-dropping adventure and sacrificing lives for the ones you love!!!!!
B007WZ55XI|5.0|First I've bought power tap hub. Started to train with power. Than I've started to use WKO+ software. But thanks these book I do realy feel what the trainings with power are all about it. Very supportive, easy to understand, easy to implement.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Much to my surprise the second book was as good as the first.  You meet the same old friends and add some new ones.  Plus you get a villain to hate.
B004I744AS|5.0|There are several fun and interesting things to read and do on this app's homepage in addition to being able to look up a word's definition.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book wasn't as surprising as the second, but this was more thoughtful.  The characters have developed into real people with real problems.  They learn that things are not always black and white, there are many shades of grey.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is an entertaining little game. my son and I really enjoy playing. I like how easy it is. I would recommend it to others.
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This is a great movie... HOWEVER I was sorely disappointed to learn there are absolutely NO extras on the DVD version.
B003O86FMW|5.0|it kept me engaged i hated to put it down. kept me wandering what was coming next, and afraid of what was coming next at the same time.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Works great on my android tablet!  Lots of helpful information on 1 page. Attractive graphics.  Well laid out page design. No problems with this app for me.
B0041H18MM|5.0|This is an excellent collection on neo-classical music with a dark ambiance like nothing else. Give this a chance and get it.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Who were the bad guys? Childs doesn't bother to make that known other than to assure that because Reacher killed them all it was likely that they were bad, i.e. a threat to national security.<br /><br />I learned more about riding around on Interstate highways in Kansas, Iowa and Nebreska than I needed to know and how all north, south, east and west roads end at T intersections.<br /><br />Also learned something, but I'm not sure what, about nuclear waste as a financial asset.<br /><br />\\"Wanted Man\\" was considerably worse than whatever it was by Childs that I read last. Blowing the plot halfway through the novel is not a wise thing to do.<br /><br />And how can 5'6\\" Tom Cruise play 6'5\\" Jack Reacher is something beyond my wildest imagination, Even computer generated imagery ain't gonna do it for me. Cruise is, truth be told, a runt.<br /><br />I may never read another work by Childs. Nothing literary; just Reacher did this, then he did that, and then he did something else and after all was said and done he stuck out his thumb to hitch a ride bearing only a toothbruch and the clothes on his back and enough dollars to buy other clothes after three days, not to mention Big Macs and 20-ounces jugs of coffee. Gack!
B0058YPGSY|4.0|But rather violent.  The Sons of Anarchy is by nature a violent show; however, I have to say that Season Four seemed to up the violence quite a bit.  The story lines are great and would continue to be so without the gratuitous violence.  Here's hoping Season Five focuses more on the story and characters while minimizing the violence displayed.
B006PFC2S2|1.0|The video quality of this picture was very poor, it was very fuzzy and then became clearer several times.  The movie was also terrible, terrible acting, terrible costuming, terrible screenplay.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|Everyone loves the Lorax!  I mean, who wouldn't?  He's an adorable character created by the amazing Dr. Seuss!  Great family movie; lots of fun for all ages!
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Townsend's book is fabulous.  His genius in song lyrics is no fluke.  Pete has plenty to say and has an accessible writing style that will delight his legions of fans.
1451662432|5.0|There are people in this world who are so mysteriously popular; as in Arnold Schwarzenegger's case, he was born very poor in a very oppressed spot of the world where he nearly became a Nazi; had it not been for the US invasion things would have turned out so very differently.  We're not so sure about his father, but Arnold himself had his old man investigated, and the authorities who conduct such investigations cleared the senior Scharzenegger's name. Whew for Arnold! From a very young age, Arnold decided he would be great and achieve greatness as early and as quickly as possible. And sure enough - he did!<br /><br />We all know him from his early bodybuilding days, and the opening part of the book was so brilliantly and warmly witten! I was pleasantly surprised at how well this book was composed and all the manners of descriptions given. I loved reading how truly positive a mind Arnold was blessed with. He always looked at life as the glass was 75% full! For a poor boy to see life this way must be attributed to his mother's attitude; mostly. His old man was a stern task master and curmudgeon, and it was his negative father that was the force which drove Arnold away from his childhood home.<br /><br />Joe Wieder spotted young Arnold and then supported young Arnold in the US when he was still just a budding body builder. Arnold had no money and spoke no English whatsoever when he first came over to US soil. Wieder took care of him and nurtured him; he was like Arnold's newfound father! So much of what we know today about bodybuidling  came from Arnold -and his own scientific thinking of what builds muscle mass and what makes a body so beautiful to behold. YES - Arnold admits to eating large quantities of protien to beef himself up and make his muscles huge, and he also used steroid injections weekly to pump himself up - but back in the day - steriods were considered healthy and not as huge a health risk as they are realized to be today.<br /><br />100% commitment to working out 8 hours a day shaped Arnold's body to be so world class as it was, and he won bodybuilding championships often.  Arnold stuck to the muscle man competitions worldwide, but he also had his own brick laying business, and his own mail order business, and also he invested in apartment buildings to create a portfolio of wealth. More than anything, Arnold was strong of mind and body / he didn't like listening to anybody!<br />He was the one to ultimately make decisions, although he would listen to successful people.<br /><br />He attracted many famous friends! Anyone who met Arnold instantly wanted to be his friend! He had this charismatic personality - nobody could be angry with him for long.<br /><br />Then he met his ultimate dream girl and status symbol- Maria Shriver, who was the niece of Pres John F Kennedy. I don't know if Arnold truly fell in love with her, but her status was like the most precious jewel he could ever have imagined. Luckily for Arnold - Maria was smitten with him! They married quite late in life - she at 30, he at 38. They shared a happy life and had 4 kids. He was a huge action hero and made lots of movies and was the biggest of the big in Hollywood elite actors. He also was a busness man and part-owner of the now defunct, Planet Hollywood Restaraunt chain. Then he got voted into office, and was elected Govenor of California as part of a recall election.  This part of the book discusses everything Arnold did while in office; it was the driest part of the book, but it was still very good and made for compelling reading.<br /><br />At this point I was simply so impressed with Arnold's ability to recall all the details of his life that were so interesting and funny! He tucks in funny one-liners he's told over the years and the puzzled reactions that people gave to him. This book was really a total recall of his amazing and happy life!!!<br /><br />Then he glossed over the juiciest part of his recent past; his relationship with Mildred -the housekeeper and baby mama of his fifth child, Joseph Baena Schwarzenegger. Out of his deep respect for his wife and kids, he did not offer alot of details, but enough to say, this is one out-of-the-box, unexpected thing that Arnold did in his life.<br />He should not say it was totally stupid because out of this illicit relationship was born a beautiful son. He has to be careful how to explain this relationship because his quiet, hidden son is listening very carefully - his young heart full of high expectations.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that he fathered two sons - 5 days apart! They are like virtual twins, but with different mothers!<br /><br /> Christopher Schwarzenegger and Joseph Schwarzenegger!<br /><br />(They do NOT look alike!) You have to look Jospeh up in the internet; Arnold forgot to include a picture of him in this book and that's a real shame!!! Arnold is a proud father and he is not ashamed to tell the world that he has a fifth child. I admire Arnold for taking the blame or taking the credit. This should not remain a secret for very much longer. The boy deserves as much prestige as the other four chillens of Scharzenegger.<br /><br />His son Joseph is a love child  that was kept secret for 14 years, but now that we all know about Josepeh, I hope Arnold does the right thing and not just support him financially, but spends quality time with him. Of all of Arnold's 5 children, Joseph is the one who most closely and magically resembles him. It's quite uncanny, but if Arnold had a clone, it would be Joseph! I wish them all the best!<br /><br />I know Arnold wants to reconcile with Maria now - more than anything else in his world, and I do wish them both the best of luck in this, but I hope that Joseph will be allowed to participate in family events and that they do not mistreat Mildred. She did the wrong thing, but it takes two to tango and they have been living under one roof for 20 years already, so they have been a family all along.<br /><br />Maria is not the sort of woman to allow herself to be a \\"Sister Bride\\" and nobody is asking her to do this. In a way however -  she was living in this type of arrangement for 14 years already. Only, she did not know it.<br />Arnold and Mildred knew, but Maria didn't have a clue and I can see how angry that must make her feel!<br /><br />Mildred cooked and cleaned for them like a humble servant, and she is a humble woman. I hope that she is treated well for the rest of her days. I also hope that she doesn't feel that she is entitled to a fortune either! She betrayed the trust of a kind woman. Maria was always so generous and loving towards her.<br /><br />My wish for you is that I hope that you read this book. It is extremely positive, uplifting and inspirational! Arnold is a good man and I think I've always loved him for my entire life.<br />I have never seen any of his movies, though - so you know I\\"m not a groupie or fantatic person about him. I just always respected Arnold for his beautiful, sculpted body and all that he's done to promote physical fitness and personal growth across the globe.<br />I wish him and Maria and then entire family many blessings from God, and that they can all be one happy family again.the housekeeper and baby mama of his fifth child, Joseph Baena Schwarzenegger.

I just always respected Arnold for his beautiful, sculpted body and all that he's done to promote physical fitness and personal growth across the globe.<br />I wish him and Maria and then entire family many blessings from God, and that they can all be one happy family again.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Had some funny parts but then the middle went off in a weird direction and went on too long.  That took away from the beginning humor of the movie.
0307887448|5.0|I will not speak long about this novel.  However there are something that need to be said.  This book is does a realy good job of drawing the audience into the post modern world that has become of humanity.  It also does and excellent job describing the OASIS and what is for many of the people who use it for their average every day lives.  For those of you who like to read I recommend this book but for those of you who like older video games it is a must read.

1416550550|5.0|I loved this story. Every time I got to the end of a chapter I would look at the next one and be like, \\"after this one, I'll go to bed.\\" The past four days I have been so sleep deprived! I haven't read many mysteries, but if thre are more like this out there, I have been missing out! I loved Eliz'a character from the start and had no idea that she would end up being Nell's mother till the last fourth of the book. I hated Adeline, the sad thing is, there are so many people in the world like her. I want to plant my own garden now! I wish I had some big juicy family secret to unfold... or any mystery at all. What fun!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very entertaining.  The story was very interesting and kept you involved until the very end.  The puzzles were just the right difficulty.  Well worth the money!
0375842209|5.0|Amazing! I was blown away!! Tears and laughs and pain and hope. Amazing! I loved the authors writing style and the bizarre narrative was gripping. Who knew death could have a sense of humor? The author did a great job describing things in a way that really made my imagination work over time. I have the most beautiful image of Papa in my head, with his accordion wrinkles making music when he smiles and talks... Beautiful language! I felt so much love for Max and the beautiful kind stories that he wrote for the girl... and poor Rudy who had to die to finally get the kiss he was after. My heart was broken at the end.. and I sobbed, but in my mind the girl went on to Marry Max and together they had their own massive library and gave each other weather reports for the rest of their lives. I loved this story and give it five stars!!
B00138J3LA|5.0|The interesting thing about this lp~cd. Saw them twice on the Brain Salad Surgery tour in Southern California, (LA and at the Cal Jam).<br />Having heard this dozens of times over the years it's surprising me that it took me this long to buy it.<br />Covers a lot of their really great tunes with a strong articulate scope to detail up to 1974.<br />They never sounded better, and never did again (On live recording that is) A few years later in 1977 a King Bisquit double live cd was recorded. (2nd cd being from 1974 and sounds great). Released in 1997 with all its bad recording scratches and all comes nothing close to WBMFTTSTNE's power and punch.<br />One of the all-around greatest groups, ever! This is a great live cd to have, so got it [!!]? Play it for the neighborhood, they'll love you XXOO
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a story of survival, faith and human nature. The story begins with a boy's tragic and fantastic story of surviving a sinking ship, losing his family and drifting on a life boat for almost a year with wild dangerous animals. Eventually Pi is left with only a ferocious Bengal tiger for company and manages to tame him and co-exist. At the end of the book another version of the story is revealed and the reader realizes that Pi was never in a life boat full of animals. He was with other human survivors. This realization makes you realize that sometimes human nature and the will to survive can be a dangerous and ugly thing. Pi faces a battle between his own animalistic desire to survive and his faith that God will provide and save him. Pi tamed the tiger. I wish the author would have wrote the story from the perspective of Pi as a young boy, instead of writing it from the perspective of Pi as an adult looking back. I feel like it would have made the entire experience more impactful. Gread read
B004VMVTNU|4.0|So far, this is the best alarm clock I've found for my 'droid. It offers many options and is easy to use.<br /><br />As others have mentioned, the only real change I'd like to see is when editing the time, it would be nice if this was bigger, easier to find on the screen, and a little easier to use.  Other than that, I have no complaints.
0307744434|4.0|This book started off beautifully. It was magical. The author took me to an imaginary place I've only ever visited before in my dreams. I especially loved the clock making. :) I found the mystery of the circus the driving force behind my page turning. I was so confused and could barely wrap my head around what conflicts were going on. This confusion added to my experience in a positive way. There were so many unanswered questions and things I didn't understand, that I didn't even think to question the illusions, charms and other mysteries that made up Le Cirque des Reves. The magic was real and it was bewitching. After the first half of the book the circus started to die and some of the mysterious details about the competition became clear and the book lost some of it's charm. I was like the reveurs, and if I could have I would have followed the circus around the world too. I only wanted to read about the magic! The descriptions of magic bottles holding memories, ice gardens, mazes that move and chocolate mice had me mezmorized. This book was a love story between two magicians, but I fell in love with the circus and was blind to anything else this book had to offer. The characters were so colorful and interesting, but I was never able to get into their head or really feel for them. They were just another amazing part of the circus to me.
B00006G8K0|5.0|I grew up with this film as it appeared on Detroit's Saturday night Chiller Movie Double-Feature in the 1970s quite often.  Along with many other Hammer films from the period, this was a great production I took for granted, thinking it--and films like it--would always be around.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Thanks to this nice DVD, I have been able to watch this film again for the first time in at least 30 years.  I had forgotten how well-made and classy it really is.  Having grown up during the years in which Christopher Lee played Dracula in numerous films, he is to me, the quintessential movie vampire.  It's hard to believe current generations remember him from contemporary fantasy films rather than his performances as the king of the undead.<br /><br />This DVD is of beautiful sound, picture and overall quality.  I am very happy with the purchase and the more than reasonable price.  I highly recommend it to anyone whose tolerance for druggy, post-modern grunge films featuring bad-mannered lower class stereotypes has reached its limit.  You won't be disappointed.
1400064627|4.0|I thought I knew what I was getting into when I started this novel, but I had no idea! I watched the movie about ten years ago and really couldn't remember too much about it besides there being a tom boy, a railroad accident and a nursing home. What I couldn't remember was the heart of the story... And wow, what a story! I must admit that when I realized I was going to be reading about the lives of two lesbians I almost gave up on the book. I'm so glad I didn't! Thankfully, this story wasn't a lesbian romance. It was a story about family and love and being happy with who you are. I wish I was able to more emotionally connect with the characters though. I wasn't too crazy about the layout of the story and spent a lot of time confused trying to figure out who was who in three generations of characters. I felt like all the newspaper articles and different narrations did give the story a more authentic feel though. In the end I was left with a smile on my face after I turned the last page and it was worth the time I spent reading it.<br /><br />I must get my hands on some friend green tomatoes and give them a try!<br /><br />P.S. I found Evelyn to be extremely irritating! What a weak, pathetic and annoying woman! I'm so glad I don't have to read about her complaining anymore
B007MHVVCU|5.0|ravens gate is one of the best books have ever read i would realy sugjest downloading this book. it has alo of action
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|**spoiler alert** \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", what an appropriate name for this book! It was cheesy, stereotypical, and ridiculous and I absolutely could not put it down! I loved this book and almost devoured the entire thing in one sitting. It's not going to win any literary awards, but it is going to be added to my list of favorites. I fell in love with bad boy Travis, but must admit that about half way through I found him to be a little clingy. This book was all about the chase for me, I wanted him and Abby to be together, but once I got what I wanted the book lost its appeal. Luckily, there were many breakups to keep me interested though and the ending was perfect! Love love love! I highly recommend to women of all ages!
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This is a fun game, and it will easily eat up a bunch of time. Simple tap, drop, watch. But if you want more coins, you sit and wait for time to pass by, or pull out some real money. That part is not so fun.
0061537969|4.0|This book gets added to my list of favorites! I don't like dogs, or racing particularly, so this is surprising. I really enjoyed the dog, Enzo's perspective and thought his narration was hilarious. I especially liked all of the conclusions he came to about life and the meaning of certain things (why dogs don't have thumbs, what happens when you die, and the evil zebra) LOL.. to fully appreciate the things I just listed you need to read the book! At times I was bent over laughing out loud (ask my husband) and at the end of the book I sobbed... loudly. I loved Enzo and I wanted him to go to Italy! I wanted him to experience more races from the passenger seat! Death is a hard thing to except and I think this book was great at allowing the reader to experience that loss in a way that felt real and it also showed us that sorrow can lead to happiness again.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Product arrived brand new and in a short amount of time. Good customer service and easy to work with. Highly recommended
1451627297|4.0|Science fiction, historical fiction, adventure, mystery and romance all tied up in a page turning thriller. I LOVED this book. I was equally tied up in all aspects of this story. I desperately wanted to know the mystery behind the \\"Jimla\\", I was holding my breath to find out what would happen to Kennedy and had my fingers crossed for Sadie and George. I have never read about characters that were so \\"ordinary\\", but at the same time so complex and real. The ordinary characters and extrodinary events made it an adventure I was able to easily put myself in and wow...what a trip!<br /><br />Fantastic read!
B00992CF6W|5.0|all of you people are saying that block story is better than mincraft but block story is a spoof of minecraft thus makeing minecraft better
0385738765|3.0|I did not enjoy The Scorch Trials as much as I did The Maze Runner. The beginning of the book was frustrating to me and boring. Seemed like there was a lot of waiting around and nothing more was really explained or added to about the mystery of WICKED for the first half of the book. I wasn't gripped till I was about 75 % done with the book and only then I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to figure out what the heck a killzone was! Teressa brutality in \\"pretending\\" to kill Thomas was a little much, and the descriptions of the monstors with the light bulbs on them was silly. I am not attached to the characters at all, but I have to find out what is going on! So I will read the next book!
B0079XPUOW|4.0|The first half of the book (thereabouts) focuses on the inherent humor in the situation and at the same time a lot of the things that don't quite make sense. And having a story told from the perspective of a pretty common sense ensign does give you a singular voice to listen to and potentially agree (or disagree) with as you all puzzle through what exactly is going on here on this ship. Are we really just making fun of the old Star Trek TV series. Does Scalzi have a different perspective that he wants to address in this very Federation-like Universal Union? And what the heck is in that Box? You'll get my drift in time.<br /><br />But when you get to the latter parts of the book (or at least the main story section), then you'll find that Scalzi really starts to work his magic and takes this book beyond the confines of mere parody. The story really takes a life of its own as our protagonists try to find a way to dramatically reduce their chances for death and perhaps figure out how to save even more lives in the longer term. And the way they they're going to do this is pretty impressive - or at the very least it's pretty fun indeed.<br /><br />I enjoyed how the book felt like light reading for the most part and yet tackled some pretty complex concepts and raised some great questions about shows that we love. Many of the story quirks that we've come to accept as tropes of the science fiction world, especially when it comes to TV and movies, take on a different perspective when you put yourself in the character's shoes. No one wants to feel like they're expendable and there are far more creative ways to make a situation seem important or more serious without introducing needless deaths into the picture after all.
0143119680|4.0|The more I got into this book the more sucked into the drama I became. The details that authenticated the story really impressed me. I loved the historical references made regarding Matthews past. I loved the 'House' and it's peculiar opinions on house guests. I felt teased by the small glimpses of power Diana had shown and found myself really invested in seeing what she is capable of. This book is about acceptance and love no matter who you are, what your race, your family background, or even species is. I can say with all sincerity, that a world where vampires and witches can love one another freely would be a beautiful world indeed!<br /><br />Most series I start I don't like enough to finish. This one I will be finishing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The book just focuses on descriptive sex without romance and far from love... Just sex as animals. I couldn't finish reading it.
B001TODO54|4.0|I am not a fan of fantasy, but Graceling by Kristin Cashore has made the short list of fantasies I have enjoyed. This was a wonderful adventure that I was able to put myself in and get lost. Every time Katsa overcame one obstacle, another one took its place. It was very exciting. The characters were all wonderful and interesting. The relationships between the characters came off a little shallow, but by the end of the book my eyes were damp at the thought of the main characters not getting their happily ever after ending. This is a great young adult book and I really liked it.
0439023513|5.0|I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoyed the first two. While some people felt that the ending was rushed, I felt that it went at the perfect pace, to make it go quicker or slower would have been to remove important pieces. You had to feel what Katniss was going through and really understand it before you could move on. The misery and despair that she felt, even at the end, were necessary given the full horror of the underlying motives within the story. To remove them or give her a happier ending would have been to kill what made the story as fascinating and terrifying as it had become. Wonderful book. Wonderful series.
0385737955|4.0|I was consumed by this book! I read it wide eyed, gripping the pages, wishing I could read faster than I could. This is a young adult book, but wow it was a page turner. I had the best time reading it! Very unique story. I didn't love the characters as much, but the story line is crazy! I was blown away with every new development and my curiosity was eating away at me. I kept trying to guess what was going to happen and I was always surprised. LOVED it, very fun easy read. One thing bothered me as I read, if the grievers could climb the walls, why did it matter if the doors shut at all at night? Why was it such a big deal when they didn't? Guess it doesn't really matter that much. :) Can't wait to start The Scorch Trials.
0811877485|1.0|I took measurements and applied them all.  I went to bed and and in the morning was excited to show the kids and every decal was on the floor.  The day prior to hanging I cleaned the walls and had fan in room for 36 hours.  I would not recommend.  I have used other decals with no problems.
030758836X|5.0|This book makes my short list of favorites. The book starts off with a light and witty tone that leads you to believe you are in for a humorous version of some Life Time drama....Shallow, but very enjoyable. Then suddenly you are in shock and caught so completely off guard that you can't do anything but turn the next page as fast as you can. The tone of the story changes and everything you read before turns into something so completely insane you just don't know what to believe anymore! Things continue to get darker and darker and the revelations more mind blowing. I finished this book and could only sit and shake my head with wide eyes and an unbelieving smirk on my face. Shock. This book is crazy, insane, unbelievable.... AMAZING.
0307341577|4.0|As the title says, this is a very dark novel. As disturbing as this book is, I could not stop reading.  I read this after reading Gone Girl and was not disappointed with Gillian Flynn's earlier work.  I recommend this to anyone looking for something not typical in current fiction.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Just read on a whim but found it to be enthralling. I'm a huge fantasy fan and this novel had it all cant wait till the next instalment!!!!!!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Super quick read just like the first! Eva's insecure personality gets a little annoying but this book is still worth reading if you liked the first one.  On that note, cant wait for the third!

B007IXWKUK|1.0|one of my friends told me that part ll was (at least) a little better, so i bought it. but i found it even worse. of course, it's easy reading, but it's not literature, unerotic and over any top imaginable.
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Lots of good songs here. I like the raw sound, but I wish the rhythm guitars were higher in the mix. They were cranked on Psycho Circus. Which is still my favorite of the last 3.

B007THA4FI|5.0|Though at times overwrought, this is a skillful and moving novel which leaves the black and white morality of Harry Potter's universe far behind.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a carefully and intricately plotted tragicomedy which takes place in the microcosm of a seemingly idyllic village called Pagford.  This world is gritty and brutally authentic, peopled with an interconnected web of very real characters.  The story revolves around an estate (government funded housing) called the Fields which is technically part of Pagford, though many Pagford residents consider it a blight on their storybook community.  The novel opens with the death of Barry Fairbrother, the man who leaves the titular vacancy on the Pagford council.  A local election ensues.  This would seem like an unimportant affair and dull basis for a novel, but Rowling illustrates the far-reaching effects such minor local politics can have.  There are no punches pulled in the grim finale.<br /><br />Others have complained that the characters are unlikeable and have no redeeming qualities.  I find that ridiculous.  To me the characters are refreshing, because in them Rowling explores truths we're often afraid to admit to ourselves.  On some level, I sympathized with every one of them.<br /><br />This is a book that takes place in the REAL world and concerns REAL people who are more multifaceted than the simpler heroes and villains of Rowling's earlier work.  I enjoyed Harry Potter, and I loved those characters, but they lived in a black and white world designed for children.  You won't find much Good vs. Evil here, just one complicated array of motives vs. another.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Read the first book with the understanding that is was a trilogy and had no idea that I had to wait months to read the next and it appears that the wait on the next is even longer. Even though I enjoyed the book I am thinking I may end now and call it quits.. I'll forget what its about by the time its ready NEXT YEAR....Why do a trilogy and not have all the books ready ???!! I think this writer needs to think about that... I say don't publish till they are all ready to read!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Book was a page turner.  Was fun to read and didn't know where it was leading you.  For the last book, it tied up all the loose ends and even left a bit to think about.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|works like it should keeps the cards covered, i did get the other one that dime card makes that only holds micro sd cards and it holds them perfectly and is half the thickness as this one and fits effortlessly in the a wallet. i would only get this one if you need to have a full size sd card or adapter on hand. check out the kingston micro sd card reader it is amazingly small.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great way to kill time. enjoyable and challenging.  nice to play on my kindle.  used to play on my computer all the time!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was well written but the story was lacking.  I kept waiting for something to happen but it never came.  The characters were not likable and in the end I did not care what choices they made.  Not a worth while read.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have hour breaks between classes and when the libray is closed I play this game. its easier then angry birds and its exciting to get further onto the game. when tings start to go real fast k get nervous and tend to do loads better then the beginning.
B001NTUAFC|5.0|great album ... Temple of the Dog was a unique fusion between members of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam/Mother Love Bone... needless to say the voices of Chris Cornell and Eddie Vedder combine perfectly generating an outstanding album ... if you are a true fan of Seattle sound from the 90s and all the grunge movement you MUST get this album for your collection

B004O3YGMC|5.0|The service does as advertised. With a strong connection, I never get kicked off. I don't rrecall having any force closes. I've even played mouse based flash games without any problems. My only qualm is that it doesn't support fullscreen. All in all' a really great app. It really deserves a. 4 and a half, for the fullscreen thing, but I'll round up because I enjoy using it so much.

0810989956|5.0|My daughter is absolutely in love with this activity book! This is the perfect gift for anyone who loves Diary of a Wimpy kid (I've got to be honest, I almost thought of getting myself this book also).<br /><br />There's almost like 3 sections to this book. The beginning is the activity section. It has pages where you fill in or draw stuff, here's a few examples of what's in it: Five things nobody knows about you, which would you rather do, a few questions from Rowley, draw your bedroom the way it looks right now, and good advice for next year's class. That's just to name a few just by randomly picking a page. Then there's about 15-20 pages of Zoo-wee Mama comics. Then lastly, there are some blank pages for \\"What's your story\\" where you can write your own story, or draw, or use it as a journal. That appears to be roughly 20-25 pages.<br /><br />My daughter has a blast filling out this book! It's a great keepsake also, I'll show it to her when she's an adult and I'm sure we'll get some laughs out of it. As for the price, Amazon has an unbeatable price on it. Right now it's $7.89 with the free shipping if you spend over $25. I bought this it Costco for $7.99. So if you're adding this to a free super saver shipping order it's unbeatable.
B007V65R54|3.0|This author presents some valuable information, but has too much about baseball!  For one not the least bit interested in baseball, it's a real slug!  This makes it hard to get to the meat of his argument.
B000001GQC|5.0|In 1938 Sergei Prokofiev supplied the score to the Sergei Eisenstein propaganda film classic \\"Alexander Nevsky.\\"  This score would go on to influence countless others - its influence is perhaps felt the most in the classic score by Basil Poledouris to the 1982 film \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" (the filmmakers even acknowledged this: the teaser trailer contains music from - you guessed it - \\"Alexander Nevsky\\").  Prokofiev's score (presented here in its concert suite version) is by turns exciting and deeply moving, in addition to stirring thoughts and feelings that cannot easily be explained - I can't even describe what I feel at the opening notes of the whole thing:  Fear?  Foreboding?  Mystery?  Excitement?  All of the above?  None of the above?  Whatever it is, I feel it deep to my core.  This is what makes Prokofiev a truly great composer.<br /><br />Also included on this disc is \\"The Scythian Suite,\\" (which also sounds \\"cinematic\\" despite being originally composed as a ballet!) which is another excellent piece of music that also displays nebulous, undefinable emotions and impressions.  \\"Lieutenant Kijé\\" rounds out the CD.  While not as musically great or emotionally affecting as the two previous suites, it is more catchy, melodic and *fun* than they are, which makes for a good end to the whole 78 minute listening experience.<br /><br />The performances by the LSO and CSO on this CD are superb - Claudio Abbado is quickly becoming one of my favorite conductors.  He is exciting without resorting to mindless bombast while simultaneously displaying a true intelligence and precision while avoiding clinical soullessness.  Everything that the man has done that I have heard so far has been solid gold.<br /><br />This DG \\"Originals\\" CD is presented in good remastered sound - clarity and tone are excellent throughout.  It comes with a booklet containing notes and lyrics.  This CD is a must for any classical music fan or any lover of film music.

B0063IH60K|3.0|I really like this game, dispite the adds.  I would be willing to pay money to get this game add free, as with so many app. like Angry Birds, etc..  I love the option to use family photos for card backs.  When the movie adds come up, use your &quot;back&quot; arrow and you are back to the game.  When an add pops up, tap the screen and tap skip.

0316228532|3.0|I never read a Harry Potter book, nor did I ever wish to. For some reason I had thought this would be an English murder mystery. I was clearly mistaken.  I am 170 pages in and there is no movement in the story. I'm bored. This book is a chore. That said, in some senses she is a fantastic writer, better than I had expected. I love her character delevopment, and I cannot overstate that. However, it seems as though that is all there is. If I am wrong, and this story picks up, please someone comment to this review and I will start reading the book again. In the meantime, I am putting it down.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Really cool how you can buy this movie on the Xbox 360 and then it is on every device kindle and lap top in the house.  Volume on all the other devices was fine but the volume through the xbox 360 is really low.  With this movie is not that huge of an issue except for the really soft talking Loki at times, but you crank it up to full on the TV and still couldn't hear him then the hulk smashes a wall and your trying to turn it down because your tv is about to fall off the wall.  I like Amazon and I like taking my movies everywhere without ruining them.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I have read all of Dan Brown's novels but somehow I missed \\"Deception Point.\\" Last week I corrected this by downloading it on my Kindle. I began reading and literally could not put this book down until the final page.<br />Brown begins with an intriguing plot set just above the Arctic Circle. From there you just hold on as he takes you from one adventure to another. The writing is tight, concise. The timing is excellent. Even though there are many characters in this novel, he does an excellent job of making sure we know each one -- and their intentions. Some noble. Some evil.<br /><br />This book takes the reader inside the Presidency, inside NASA and you believe it all. Dan Brown, to me, really shines in this book! I wanted the two main characters to go on and move into a sequel, maybe? Please?<br /><br />Great read! Don't start it and expect to read a chapter or two. It's just that good.<br /><br />Joyce Norman<br />Author, Publisher
B009JCL58G|5.0|I haven't seen Cloud Atlas, and hence cannot comment on the interplay between the music and the movie, so I will restrict my comments to the standalone quality of the score:<br /><br />While the music from the action scenes is fairly typical of what you would hear in other contemporary movies, the real strength of the Cloud Atlas album is in the main theme - \\"The Atlas March\\". For those that watched the 5 minute trailer for the movie, \\"The Atlas March\\" is the opening music for the trailer (and first track of this album), which is rounded out by M83's \\"Outro\\".<br /><br />I'm a fairly avid movie score collector and it's not often that you come across a theme so awe inspiring and refreshing - kudos to the trio of composers on a job well done!<br /><br />Notable tracks (favorites*)<br /><br /> 1) Prelude: The Atlas March*<br /> 3) Travel to Edinburgh<br />10) Kesselring<br />16) All boundaries are conventions*<br />18) Chasing Luisa Rey<br />20) Death is only a Door<br />21) Cloud Atlas Finale*<br />23) Cloud Atlas End Title*

0525953728|5.0|More gripping than a feature film Mark Owen tells the story of Seal Team 6's mission to confront Osama bin Laden in this short accessible 299 page book.<br /><br />From his early days as a kid in Alaska onward Owen also tells his personal story...about growing up, learning to use firearms, becoming interested in special operations work, applying for Seal Team status and ultimately applying for elite Seal Team status.<br /><br />In this account Owen is clear to share responsibility with all those really responsible for the success of Seal Team 6's raid: the people in the intelligence community who tirelessly spent years tracking bin Laden to his \\"hide away\\" which was in full view of Pakistan's elite military academy other military who tirelessly fought and suffered in the foothills between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Only at the end of the book does Owen modestly add the involvement of his own team as they spent 38 minutes on the ground at Abbotabad taking out bin Laden's command center and collecting vital intelligence information.<br /><br />Owen also reveals bin Laden's predictable cowardice. Unlike initial accounts, bin Laden didn't go down in a fire fight but rather had stayed put in his room with two of his wive's and some children.<br /><br />Aside from the story itself of course Owen gives the reader a bit of a taste of life as a Navy Seal. He generously uses terms like \\"watch your 6\\" and also talks about the various pranks team members play on each other. These homey qualities only add to the already heroic picture Owen so accurately paints of these special soldiers who routinely risk all they have for their country.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I like it. Good job on this game. I don't usually have much time, so this game is perfect for me.
B0091THRCU|4.0|Purchased this because I have always had slip cases for my iPhones.  I was tremendously disappointed with this case.  It is nigh impossible to get the phone into the case.  Often the silent switch is tripped.  The fit is way, way, way too tight.  Pulling on the tab takes significant force to even get the phone to move.  I am just really disappointed in the case.  It is like they designed it based on rumored iPhone specifications and didn't have one to use. I can't comment on the card capacity or durability because I will never be using this case long enough to evaluate those items.<br /><br />UPDATE: Snugg replaced the case with an updated one.  It fits better, though is still tight.  The card slots remain functional with a phone in the case.  It is a much more usable version, properly sized.  Revising to a 4-Star.
1451695195|5.0|This book made me believe in God almost immediately because it is such a highly persuasive and compelling read that coerces you to believe in something for which there is no physical proof, which is a very solid basis on which to assert a belief! Dr. Alex is indeed a very smart and MENSA-like neurosurgeon who is absolutely not doing this for the money or to capitalize on his 7-day coma, although I do find it a bit suspicious that he is selling his story as a book instead of making it available for free in some direct mail offerings. Oh well, I'm sure that that is just a coincidence and that I am asking all the wrong questions despite their obvious logic.<br /><br />I, too, consider myself something of a scientist, just like Dr. Alex, except that I am a subscriber to Nat Geo Magazine and not an actual neurosurgeon. As such, I have found it hard and downright impossible to reconcile my absorption of the information from Nat Geo Magazine with the concept of God or Allah, whatever you want to call Him. However, reading his book, I had my eyes open up and was blinded by the holy light of Dr. Alex's conviction in God to the point that I now, too, also believe in God. Of course, I also believe in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Clause and the Boogeyman, but make of that what you will.<br /><br />The strength of Dr. Alex's book is how vividly and engrossingly he describes his journey into Heaven. First, while he is in his 7-day coma, he is greeted by none other than St. Peter at the gates of Heaven. After he is let in, he is instantly reunited with all of the dead pets he ever had as a kid growing up. So far so good! In no particular order, he also meets all of Jesus' apostles, Mary Magdalene (demon-free, this time!), the thief who was nailed next to Jesus, Job, Noah, all the people who were fed with just the five loaves and two fishees, and, of course, Pope John Paul II. Yowza! Talk about an ultra-vivid account of awesomeness that grabbed my fledgling, religious attention and made me throw my hands up in praise of the Lord. Yessir...it did.<br /><br />As you can see, Dr. Alex's account of meeting all those guys in Heaven was so powerful that I could not help but fall under its awesome spell of conversion. Here's how I look at it: If God and Heaven aren't real, then how come Dr. Alex was allowed to write such an incredibly detailed and rich testimonial that he, as the capitalist he is, is now selling for a pretty penny?!?! You tell me, but I will tell you that this shows that God is real, baby.me throw my hands up in praise of the Lord.

B0071MQBX0|5.0|I think the lead female had a better voice than Sarah Brightman.  I'd seen this play three times live and this edition matched it beautifully.  The fact that the chandelier didn't fall didn't lessen the impact of the moment.  The music is what is the focal point of this production and a couple of times the phantom singing brought me to tears myself!  I will enjoy this musical many times in the future.  And it was great seeing the original cast and listening to ALW at the end.  Well worth the money!

B00866JL96|1.0|The movie was interesting the first time through. Acting good, locations interesting, but after that, the movie would come to a stop in different locations and start over all on it own. Tried playing it on different machines with the same results. Good movie, but quality of DVD questionable.

B007MB5OCE|4.0|Great book that translated well, for any nationality to laugh at and enjoy.  Some knowledge in global events helps, but no need for political passion.  Felt like I stumbled onto this amazing book, just like the main character Allan stumbled through life meeting amazing people.

Game's a lot of fun to mess around with. Definitely will be playing it quite a bit. Thanks Amazon!

1451695187|4.0|This is an intriguing book. Dr Eben Alexander III, a Harvard neurosurgeon, who had been skeptical of life after death becomes a convert to the cause in 2008 after having had his own near-death experience caused by a bout of severe bacterial meningitis and lapsing into a seven day coma.<br /><br />Dr Alexander who had been a man of logic and firm believer in the scientific method had not believed the spiritual accounts of near-death experiences  that some of his patients described finds himself writing a book in which in his own near death experience he sees \\"a  beautiful blue-eyed woman in a place of clouds, big fluffy pink-white ones and shimmering beings.\\"<br /><br />He is told, \\"you are not here to stay. We will teach you many things but you will be going back.\\" As to the content, I do not want to say more and give away the story!<br /><br />The book is important not only because of the content but also because of the credentials of the author.  Dr Alexander is a scion of a family of scholars that spans several generations. His grandfather was a surgeon, his father a prominent academic neurosurgeon, the long-time head of the Department of Neurosurgery at Winston Salem, N.C., and former editor of a prominent medical journal, Surgical Neurology.<br /><br />Dr Alexander III, the author himself has had a distinguished career in clinical and academic neurosurgery at prestigious institutions, so the out of body experience that transformed him from a dismissive skeptic to a firm believer who now asserts that heaven exists-can not be dismissed outright.<br /><br />I recommend that the seminal work of Psychiatrist Raymond A. Moody Jr., M.D., i.e.,  \\"Life After Life & Reflections on Life After Life\\" (1975) or his subsequent work be perused before one reads this book; it would serve as an essential introduction to and a useful reference for the initiate.<br /><br />For workers in this field-i.e., scientists,  theologians, physicians, and psychologist- the book is a most. For those who have enjoyed pondering this topic, aficionados of the great work of Dr. Raymond Moody, and readers with an open mind on the subject I recommend this book. For those who can neither fathom the reality of near death experiences nor have an interest in the spiritual or scientific basis for such phenomena, the book may still be interesting.

B008RC72G8|1.0|A horrible movie, start to finish. Gratuitous sex, mutilation, waste of fine actors. Who wrote this awful script? Ugh! Could have been so much better. The best part? The music clips which -don't really fit the movie. Where was the great Danny Elfman's touch? Not here. Tim Burton put his name on this smelly fiasco? And Johnny Depp, what a disappointment. No acting ability in this one-anyone could have done what he did. So sad to see Hollywood putting out garbage on the classic tv show. Don't they have other projects to invest in? And Barnabus getting a BJ by the doctor? Really? Not age appropriate at all. I can't believe the smut they stick into kids movies. Was it really necessary? And the killing of innocents, workmen and hippies? I almost turned this off half way through, see, the problem of who lit the candles in the 200 year old secret passageway bothered me, as did no dust on his precious treasures down there. So many 'bad' plot turns and poor writing make this a loser for all involved. Best parts are the vintage pop tunes and woodwork in the mansion. When the best actor of the movie is Alice Cooper-the woman, you got a problem. I pray to god they don't make a sequal to this turkey PLEASE!!!!
B008O9V4C2|5.0|I realize this is a solo album for Mr. Fagen, but to me it has the most Steely-Dan-like vibe of any of his albums.  I think this is for two reasons:<br /><br />1) He had a collaborator on this album -- the multi-instrumentalist Michael Leonhart, who co-produced, co-arranged horns and vocals, plays trumpet, clavinet, synths, and,under a pseudonym, drums. I think Fagen is different when he's working with a teammate. He's not just trying to express himself, he's trying to entertain a musical partner.  That sense of &#34;can you top this&#34; is not a feature of most Fagen solo work, but it is all over this album.<br /><br />2) Thematically, he's done with the autobiographical cycle of Nightfly, Kamakiriad and Morph the Cat.  Writing about himself, his songs were necessarily less edgy and more reflective.  It works great, especially on the first album, and his weaving of sci-fi and ironic political commentary made his albums tougher and more surprising than the competition, but compared with Steely Dan -- mellower.  This album is not about himself.  Instead, like Steely Dan, he is telling stories here, and the characters in many of these stories resemble Steely Dan characters at least somewhat. Maybe a little less depraved and existential.  But characters, for whom Fagen creates magnificent series of soundtracks, classic Dan-style guitar work and horns that any fan of &#34;My Old School&#34; or &#34;Black Cow&#34; will immediately recognize. Lyrically, he picks up a few Steely Dan themes that he tended to leave out of his solo work til now.  &#34;Slinky Thing&#34; brings back the horny old man trying to keep up with a young chick that we got to know well on Gaucho and Two Against Nature.  We get two songs about named women, &#34;Miss Marlene&#34; and &#34;Planet D'Rhonda,&#34; that remind you a bit of &#34;Josie,&#34; &#34;Peg,&#34; &#34;Lunch with Gina,&#34; or the &#34;Negative Girl.&#34; &#34;The New Breed&#34; features another Steely Dan trope--the love triangle, sexual jealousy. Although, this time, the narrator is more resigned and philosophical, even as he condemns his young gal to her &#34;new dotcom slash life.&#34;<br /><br />Based on the first few days of playing this over and over, I would say the album is amazingly consistent, only one or two songs falling short of the best tracks on here.  Man, the music sounds great!  My current favorites are probably &#34;I'm Not the Same Without You,&#34; &#34;Weather in My Head,&#34; &#34;Miss Marlene&#34; and &#34;Planet D'Rhonda.&#34;  &#34;Out of the Ghetto&#34; is funny with its concept of adding klezmer instrumentation to the rapid-fire funk.  The other songs are great too.  Really nothing bad to say about it; all four of his solo albums are treasures.ugh, this time, the narrator is more resigned and philosophical, even as he condemns his young gal to her &#34;new dotcom slash life.&#34;  Based on the first few days of playing this over and over, I would say the album is amazingly consistent, only one or two songs falling short of the best tracks on here.

B003SI05PG|4.0|My daughters are very excited about Halloween, and they really wanted to watch Nightmare Before Christmas.  They saw it last year, but I'm not sure how much they remembered.  This year they were very into it.  We rented it on Amazon Instant Video and I think they watched it three times during the rental period.  Since then they have watched several other Tim Burton movies and enjoyed them all (Corpse Bride, Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands).

B008G8SFGO|1.0|I grew up with KISS and idolized them as a pre-teen thinking they were a great rock n roll band.  I fell out of love with them around \\"Unmasked\\" and really did not like \\"Creatures\\" or anything that followed that until the reunited release of \\"Psycho Circus\\".  What I liked about early KISS was their unique sound, catchy rock tunes and memorable sounds. Memorable songs, memorable bass lines, memorable guitar solos, riffs, etc.  Those days are long gone.  Mediocrity is the vibe here and it appears like all these tunes were written in one day and recorded the next.  It \\"sounds\\" good with fat and crunchy guitars and some sweet tone from Tommy at times, but there are few decent songs, really churned out burned out toss off songs. Gene has more songs than Paul and most of them are just crummy tunes, perhaps paul has been to busy painting, I dunno, but no one brought any tunes, melodies, solos. or anything memorable to the table. Whem KISS try to go back to the old sound they never go back far enough as there is a lot of 80's KISS vibe here in the vocal sounds and I just don't appreciate that era of the band. Anyway, I am glad I heard it, but I don't need to own it.  For completists only.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|There's just so much description of sex and sex toys a person can take and then it becomes boring and mundane and by the end of the first book, I was bored with it and skipping pages.  This second book, I skipped pretty much anything that suggested sexual descriptions were imminent and when you do this, the book becomes much thinner.  So, I am a tad curious about book three but not for the sex....I want to know what more the two could possibly accomplish in the other parts of their life but I prefer to make that up in my own head and not buy the book because if there is any further references to their sex life it would just be disgusting and a waste of paper and trees and I read it on my Kindle.  Essentially, there was no need for a trilogy.  The sex could have been pared down and it all made into one book for my money.  The only reason I put one star above is because less than that was not made available and you have to put something in order to do the review but in actuality, I would not give this book an entire star just because there is far too much sex in it. Way more than is necessary.  It keeps you from using your own imagination and having your own sex life.

B000JCSBU0|5.0|I was familiar with Darren Aronofsky after seeing 'Pi' on video some years back.  When I heard he had a new film under his belt, I was more than eager to catch up.  What I didn't know was that I was in store for both one of the great movies of our generation and one of the most unexpected horror films you're likely to ever see.  I remember walking into the theater surrounded by warning signs about the film's unrated content, and ran into a 'Pi' fan in the lobby.  I sort of expected it to be uncompromising given 'Pi' and it's own excursion into madness and possible death, but I don't think one can ever really say they were 'prepared' for what 'Requiem' had in store for it's viewers.  Based upon the novel by Hubert Selby, Jr.(Last Exit to Brooklyn), it tells the story of 3 addicts, Harry Goldfarb, Marion Silver, and Tyrone C. Love, seeking backdoor success in the drug underworld, paralleling the story of an elderly woman and mother of one of the addicts, Sara Goldfarb.  While it cross-cuts between all 4 characters, the film is really about Sara Goldfarb and her innocent, naive foray into self-destruction.  The ultimate aim of the film, of course, is to show how all the characters are clinging to a notion and thus bury their heads in the sand even as the natural forces of the world start to erode them away.  When Harry Goldfarb, for example, shoots heroin into an open wound, it's both shocking visually but thematically illustrates his surrender to a notion that everything will wrap up nicely in the end.  It'd be easy to dub 'Requiem' an anti-drug film, but it's about addiction period, consuming until your own addictions start to eat you alive.  Everything from television, coffee, chocolate, sun-bathing, losing weight, etc., are all used by the characters to give their lives a sense of purpose.  Marion Silver, after snorting cocaine, says to Harry 'you make me feel like a person'.  These are people who don't know how to live with themselves, before and after their inevitable tragic downfall.<br /><br />In the years since, I feel writer-director Darren Aronofsky has indeed gone on to make greater films ('The Fountain' is my personal favorite of his), but he has yet to make a film quite as dark and unforgiving as 'Requiem' a second time, if ever again.  In the 12 years since it's initial release, it still has the power to horrify, enthrall, and deeply move all who come into contact with it.  Bravo, Mr. Aronofsky!  Bravo!
B007MDB548|4.0|First off, I want to express some dissatisfaction with Amazon and Disney Movie Rewards for not coordinating efforts on DMR's coupon offer. I ended up buying this elsewhere because Amazon does not take DMR coupons. There has got to be a way around this. I would much rather buy it on Amazon and have it delivered to my door.<br /><br />At any rate, Disney has hit it out of the park again with this one. There is a compelling story, surprisingly good animation for a direct to home video movie, good eye candy, great new voices and characters, old characters get appropriate screen time, and it beats the new stuff that Mattel is producing hands down. Monster High started off with a real stinker on DVD, and the Barbie movies are becoming unwatchable. The Tinker Bell movies are all good overall, but this one is probably the best.<br /><br />Fans of the Tinker Bell from Disney's Peter Pan should know that the character has been homogenized for mass consumption in these movies. This is a kinder, gentler Tinker Bell, made to sell toys to little girls. It's not intended for people waxing nostalgic for the little fairy in Peter Pan whose behavior was sometimes a bit sociopathic.<br /><br />In this installment, Tinker Bell meets her sister, a winter fairy who was born from the same baby's laugh as Tinker Bell. Tinker Bell breaks the rules again, because her curiosity is strong and that's just what she does. Winter fairies and spring/summer/autumn fairies cross into each others' worlds, and Tinker Bell and friends must once again save Pixie Hollow and the pixie dust tree.<br />Everything is better with sparkles - The fairy queen's dress is made of pixie dust, and there is plenty of glittery snow, with sparkling wings and other shiny things. The movie is visually appealing and is pretty to watch. Not to mention the handsome new male characters introduced as love interests for other peripheral characters.<br /><br />Hey, it's that guy! - There are plenty of celebrity voices in this edition, including heavy-hitters like Timothy Dalton and Angelica Huston. There are plenty of young, up and coming actors who lent their voices to this too, so there will be celebrity voices that just about everyone will recognize. Even some of the characters are familiar--Dewey appears to be channeling Father Guido Sarducci. This is an old, rather obscure reference that few people will get, but it was interesting to hear this accent on a librarian fairy.<br /><br />The extra features on the 4 disc combo pack are OK. There are 2 music videos and a teaser for the next Tinkerbell feature, along with a mini-movie called Pixie Hollow Games. Whatever you do, do not select the sneak peeks. There are so many of them that go for so long that by the time they're done, the polar ice caps will have melted and the earth will be ruled by dirty apes.<br /><br />I don't see anything here that might be considered inappropriate for children, and I would be comfortable watching this with the whole family. I think that this movie is something you will enjoy if you can accept this version of Tinker Bell, and if you enjoy children's movies in general. This is a great story with great lessons and clean adventure for everyone.ition, including heavy-hitters like Timothy Dalton and Angelica Huston.

B000XWJMGS|5.0|After six years and countless shows across the country, my Shure e5c ear monitors finally started to short out at the plug. I've tried so many different headphones, but none could fill the hole in my heart left by my e5's. I could have possibly sent them off to Shure and pay $270 to get an updated pair of e5's, but after dropping $500 on them in the first place, I decided on a simpler fix. Neutrik plugs are the top recommended on several audiophile websites I frequent, and so I ordered one of these. This was after I bought a replacement plug from The Shack.<br /><br />I'm fairly good with a soldering iron, so that wasn't the problem. Since the e5s's cord is basically a cat-5 cable, the only problem I had was fitting all the wires into place. I then finished it up with a dab of hot-glue to keep the wires separate, then super-glue on the joint, and then some nail-polish to cover the L joint.<br /><br />Overall, I can't hear any difference, but I'm also not a full-fledged audiophile. After a month of heavy use (working out, playing shows, practicing, etc), the short is gone.<br /><br />Please, do not waste $3 on plugs from The Shack because they are easier to get locally. Get it right the first time and order Neutriks.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I loved this game until I updated the software and the game reset itself. months of play down the drain! This happened to me twice. I am unistalling
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book! Its so entertaining I cant even put it down! All my friends love it too! I recommend it to anyone who likes action, with a little bit of romance and tragedy. It's so action packed! It keeps you wanting more! I am very happy with my purchase! If you haven't read it yet than I think you should or you'll be missing out!!!!!!!!!

0385535147|4.0|John Grisham's work runs the gambit.  Some serious, some funny, some nostalgic, and some sporty. But no matter what you know you're in for a good read. This one is no different. 'The Racketeer' falls somewhere between the seriousness of 'The Confession' and the fun of 'The Litigators'.<br /><br />Our friend, Malcolm Bannister, is a lawyer who is in jail (I'll pause for your jokes here) for a crime he didn't commit. (Another pause). Fortunately for him the unfortunate demise of a Federal judge and his lady (hot, young, sexy, hot, you get the picture) friend is his key for early release. No clues, no witnesses, no leads, and no evidence. These frivolous minor details don't bother the FBI and they don't really bother Malcolm. He knows the truth and the Feds will pay dearly for it. Of course when dealing with the Feds and a jailed lawyer, \\"truth\\" is more of a mythological punchline than anything else.<br /><br />While 'The Racketeer' is a fast read make yourself slow down, especially near the end. There are many pieces to this puzzle and you'll miss it if you read at the speed in which John writes. I mentioned earlier that our boy Malcolm goes through some pretty extraordinary lengths to get what he wants and that IS NOT an exaggeration. But then the question we must ask ourselves is; what is the price of freedom?  What would you pay for or suffer through just for the chance to be free?  You're about to find out. Oh... and what if that taste of freedom was seasoned with a bit of revenge?<br /><br />Malcolm has people to pay back, but before he does that he must deal with this little issue of piecing together a plan with more moving parts than the space shuttle and a failure rate of my high school algebra class. Will it work?  Well that depends on your working definition of \\"work\\". Either way it'll be fun.  And it was fun.  With every new Grisham book there are always the litany of superlatives that follow it.  \\"King of the legal thriller\\", \\"America's greatest storyteller\\", \\"John Grisham is uber-popular\\", \\"John Grisham is Jason's best friend\\", \\"John is a magnificent storyteller\\".  While I don't doubt these claims, I've never once bought a book based on a five word praise fest.  I rely on other book lovers like myself.  You don't know me, but I ask you to trust me on this; Grisham is the man and he's earned it.  That's my eight word praise fest.r\\", \\"John Grisham is uber-popular\\", \\"John Grisham is Jason's best friend\\", \\"John is a magnificent storyteller\\".

0060763280|1.0|Unfortunately I did not read the comments before I bought the book and I bought it due to its cover resemblance to \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\". After reading the comments I suspected it was intentionally made this way to hinder you into buying it. I printed the Amazon return code even before I got it and as soon as it was here I took it out of the box at the post office and sent it back.
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I bought this after listening to a couple songs and I could not love it more. Imagine Dragons is now one of my favorite bands and On Top of The World is basically my anthem. Everyone I've played the songs for has fallen in love too. If you're thinking about it, buy it. You can blame me if you don't like it... seriously.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|Typicall Follett -- Well written and keeps moving along at a good pace.  This is a hard time in history, and he keeps right on with the facts of the time.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great app, since the Fire HD doesn't have a built in meter.Lets you know exactly how much battery life you have for whatever app you want to use.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game! There is nothing better than a good HOG(hidden object game)!!! This one is very nice because you can find objects in a plethora of ways including with a flashlight, mixed up letters, shadows ext... I love it. The only problem that I have had was the fact that the game will sometimes shut down for no apparent reason, which is quite annoying, but if they fix  that then the game would be perfect!!!
0345803507|1.0|Admittedly I was sucked in with the first book, the second installment was a must read after the first book ended with such a teaser. The second book was really bad. The final book in this silly trilogy? Bad read. So much that it pained me to get through it - I read when I needed to fall asleep. Just finished last night. Good night and farewell Mr. and Mrs. Grey. I'll not be waking you no matter how tantalizing a fourth book might hit the market. Don't wast your time on book two or three.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|These two gentlemen truly take the gift of music a step further in being able to touch the hearts of many with their different genres of music that they are talented enough to branch out to include all listeners..  Actually had the opportunity to hear them at the Elton John Show in Tampa, FL a month ago and was totally impressed and amazed.  If you need more imput, just do a goggle yourself then sit back and enjoy a pleasant ride!!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|This movie is great. My granddaughter age 7 is very happy with it. She watches it over and over again. She loves Gizmo, I had to get her a doll of him!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Not one of my favorites. Diana is one of the last Bishop witches. Try as she might, Diana just can not escape her heritage. As Diana is researching a project she comes across an old manuscript known as Ashmole 782 and the demons vampires and other witches come out to try and capture the secrets within the manuscript. While I did enjoy parts of this book, I thought that it moved at a really slow pace - for each step forward, it seemed like I took two steps back. I did not love this story; it was just okay. I remember wishing it would just be finished.  This was s book club selection and so I did finish it.
B008NABUU8|1.0|this game is slow and it frozed my kindle this &quot;game&quot;  could have made me lose alot of money geting a new kindle i hate this game
B0063IH60K|5.0|it is entertaining for me because I have a small attention span. and it makes you think and it is very enjoyable
0679805273|5.0|The book was in excellent condition.  There was just one small pen mark on the inside of the front page but it was okay.  This is going to be a gift for my 8yr old when she graduates from high school.  We are getting all of her teachers each year to sign it for her and give it to her at graduation.
0385360177|1.0|totally my fault...but I ordered the audio, cd version to be downloaded (which I didn't download) instead of the paperback.  What I need to do is reorder the paperback...have not done so as of yet.
B0042AGN7I|5.0|This is my Number 1 Movie all my life,must see.must have it.<br />I have been watched it over 100 times.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie was great. It captures what is sorely missing from today's society. Compassion in the face of such great diversity. I hope the care in bringing these characters to life will be just as good in the next one.
B00933ZIF2|5.0|This is an excellent show but unfortunately I do not get it at home because we don't have Showtime with our satellite service.  The series looks great and I plan to order Season I soon, but for now using Amazon was the way to go for just wanting to see an episode.  It downloaded quickly and worked great on my computer with no problems!
B000W9399S|5.0|I came upon The Color of Magic after several forays into the Discworld. I was thoroughly pleased with the adventure of Rincwind and his tourist friend. It really is a fun read and a good introduction into Discworld. I originally started my journeys with \\"The Thief of Time.\\" And have been the occasional inhabitant of the Discworld from time to time.
