1469984202|5.0|I tore through the first six Wool stories in a day and a half.  I couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for number 7, and 8, and 9....  I haven't enjoyed a story this much since Ender's Game - I am completely drawn into it.  Hugh Howey is destined to become a leader in the genre, and he's just getting revved up!!
0307949508|5.0|I THINK IT WAS THE BEST IN THE TRILOGY!IT WAS FAST PACED AND EASIER TO GOT INTO FROM THE BEGINNING.
0345803493|5.0|I just loved this book!! I read it in one day then had to go out to Walmart and but the third book. I am fifty shades obsessed!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book!  I would highly recommend.  Made you feel like you were there.  Mr. Owens did an excellent job of making you feel like you were part of the SEAL Team.
1469984202|5.0|Most of what I like about this book has been said before. All of the elements that went into crafting this story meshed nicely, and I truly appreciate the painstaking effort that has been put into making this a cohesive world with multi-faceted characters and a rich history.<br /><br />It's all been covered by other reviewers. Exhaustively. It has been pretty well-established that Wool is an outstanding example of post-apocalyptic fiction, and is worthy of the positive attention it has garnered thus far.<br /><br />So here's a somewhat more personal review.<br /><br />I cannot remember the last time a character's words gave me chills, to the point that I had to put the book down for a moment and rub my arms. So much of this story was ... just intensely *satisfying* in a way that I don't often find.<br /><br />A lot of the events and twists in the story managed to surprise me. There were situations and twists that suddenly fit together in that happy \\"matching puzzle pieces\\" sort of way.<br /><br />I appreciate it. I'm glad I read it. Since I started reading it, I have already told half the people I know about Wool, and if they do not buy this for themselves, I may very well just gift them copies of it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|It was very good,alittle  slow at times but all and all a pretty neet movie.I think the wife enjoyed it more than I,but ya it was cool.
B008XNZMOU|3.0|I've loved all her albums until this one.  I agree with some other reviews ~ just didn't quite sound like her style of music.<br />Quite a few songs I have to just skip over (they actually hurt my ears, the sound is so bad) each time and I only like a couple songs ~<br />Just not very substantial  ~ disappointing.  Quality in the sound is not there.<br />I miss her old style ~
B007TK77QE|1.0|Parish Council elections have lttle general appeal. Too many superficial characters create confusion in the poorly constructed plot. Plentiful action in the last chapters remains unresolved. Not up to Harry Potter standard!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Loved the book; could not stop reading it. I read all three in the trilogy, but this one was the best.  Really keeps you going.
B008OOYALE|5.0|awesome addictive game. whole family plays and helps each other out. we finally have somethink they can play on ipods and i can play on my kindle
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is the best game in the world get it. it is really fun and you build flying things and cars it is the best.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Action!! Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?<br />Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
0061122416|5.0|I first discovered The Alchemist a few years back and loved it.  Since then I have re- read it over and over and each time enjoy it more and more.  I find a new message each time.  I recommend this book to all my friends (and really believe I am doing them a great service by doing so :-)).  This book is a beautiful story and evokes so many emotions and images of a mysterious world.  It is a gentle reminder to follow your instincts, your heart and have faith to find your true purpose.  Sometimes it is right in front of us and we don't see it and other times we have to take a journey to find it but that journey is always signposted, we don't always see or take notice of the signs, but after reading this story, I believe you will certainly be more aware of the forces guiding you.  I find this book a great comfort and looking forward to my next Paulo Coehlo book.  This man has a true gift.
B0091REZMW|4.0|over all good.  I refuse to pay for energy so I play in short bursts and let time recharge me.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is perhaps the most irreverent and sarcastic character I have followed. Corey's let's it all hang out. There is no such thing with him as being politically correct when speaking of government agencies, religion, sex etc etc.<br /><br />The story is very timely as it deals with U.S. relations with terrorism and Arab countries.<br /><br />Is Corey the hunted or the hunter. Read The Panther and see.
1936608898|5.0|The book is called It Starts with Food, because, as they say in the intro \\"Whatever you are seeking--improvement in energy, mood, focus, sleep, athletic performance, symptoms, medical conditions, body composition or quality of life...it starts with food.\\"<br /><br />The Whole30 program (30 days of eating the way they suggest) is available for free on their website (whole9life.com).  Anyone can do it or read about it for free, without the book. What makes the book so excellent is it gives you all the additional information about why it works and how to utilize the information to help yourself succeed. It gives a backbone to this method of eating, and provides the science behind it. If you're not interested in the science, there is a whole lot of \\"coaching\\" to help you understand how your past choices led you to where you are today.  It's not a diet or a method to lose weight (they even tell you not to weigh yourself, but the vast majority of people who try it lose weight).<br /><br />The authors' tone is light and engaging--not a sciencey snore-fest that has you struggling to pay attention. They believe in \\"tough love\\" so they will lay it on the line for you.<br /><br />My absolute favorite part of the whole book in on page 29.  A brief excerpt (if it's allowed!):<br /><br />You already know that fast food, junk food and sweets aren't good for you. You know you shouldn't eat them if you want to lose weight, get off your medication or be healthier. Yet you continue to eat them. You struggle with food cravings, bad habits, compulsions and addictions. You know you shouldn't but you feel compelled to eat these foods. Sometimes, you don't even want them, but you eat them anyway. And you have a hard time stopping. All of which makes you feel guilty and stressed--and more likely to comfort yourself with even more unhealthy food. We're here to tell you IT\\"S NOT YOUR FAULT. You are not lacking willpower. You are not lazy. And it's not your fault that you can't stop eating these foods.\\"<br /><br />That, by itself, shifted something for me. Reading, in bold, in the center of the page IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT--something finally clicked. It wasn't my fault.<br />Nevermind the \\"bad\\" foods, I have been \\"eating healthy\\", doing everything \\"right\\" the way \\"they\\" told me for the majority of my life. It didn't work.  This book explained why. It gave me the tools to take my life back.<br /><br />Notes on some of the other reviews/criticisms (and I feel a need to comment on them because I always read the negative reviews to see the counterpoints):<br /><br />This book has a ton of positive reviews--the reason being, it makes sense. When you read it, you get it. If you try a Whole 30 and you feel better, you will want to shout it from the rooftops (or the next best thing, an amazon review!)<br /><br />It is well researched--it includes 21 pages of sources and references at the back.<br /><br />Regarding \\"what people have eaten for thousands of years\\" or \\"that the French drink wine and that was never a problem for them! or \\"the Japanese have always eaten rice and they're fine!\\" There is a difference between SURVIVING and THRIVING. Yes, there are things that are edible that we can eat, and yes a lot of them have been eaten for a long, long time. But were we DESIGNED to eat them? Are they the BEST choice? Do they make us HEALTHIER or not? And, for every study that says milk is bad there will be another one that says milk is fine (or wine, or wheat, or corn or whatever). The point of the book and the program is TRY IT FOR YOURSELF. Do YOU feel better drinking wine? Then drink it! Do you feel terrible after ice cream? Don't eat it anymore. The point it to give your body 30 days to reset, to get back to basics, and then for you to be able to see which foods help you be a better you, and which foods make you feel crappy.<br /><br />Regarding food being difficult to source or expensive--the food recommended is meat, fruit and vegetables. They do mention some condiments or alternative fat sources (coconut aminos, coconut oil) none of which seemed overly expensive, and all of which were available on amazon the last time I checked.<br /><br />Regarding this being a \\"fad\\"-- when has eating real, whole foods (meat, fruit, veg) ever been a fad? It is the most basic and original way of eating. It makes the most sense. When did eating \\"edible oil products\\" and \\"artificial sweeteners--now with added fiber and antioxidants!\\" become acceptable \\"foods?\\" I think the Europeans would laugh a lot more at that crap than at someone eating a steak with salad and a sweet potato.<br /><br />If I had read this book a few years ago, I might not have been ready for it yet.<br />A lot of people who read it now might not be quite ready for it. You might not \\"buy in\\" to the information they are sharing with you because you're not ready to let go of your own wants/desires/habits/history/reasons/ideas regarding the food you eat.<br />The bottom line is everything you eat is going to make you more healthy or less healthy. The authors will share with you which food does what and why. And then provide you with a framework to try it out for 30 days and see how you feel. That's it.<br /><br />A lot of people will come to this book from the world of Paleo (and if you did, good choice. My top 3 Paleo book recommendations are It Starts with Food, Primal Blueprint and Practical Paleo). And some may not. One of the smartest things about this book is that although it provides many \\"paleo\\" concepts, it is not telling you to be a caveman. You don't have to concern yourself with what is or isn't \\"Paleo.\\" They say in the book \\"We are far more concerned with health than we are with history. We aren't recommending meat and vegetables because we think that's what our ancestors ate...we care about what is making us, here and now, more or less healthy. And we suspect that's what you care about, too.\\"<br /><br />30 days can seem \\"hard\\" or like a \\"long time\\" but honestly, once you do it, it goes by quickly. (And, as the authors say, \\"beating cancer is hard. Drinking your coffee black is. not. hard.\\")And the 30 day limitation, for me, was freeing because guess what? Those foods aren't going anywhere. After 30 days, they will still be there and if I want them, I can have them. But for 30 days, making myself say \\"no\\" allowed me to kick my sugar habit to the curb, and finally have a day where I didn't feel like I was on a rollercoaster of blood sugar, bloating, indigestion and fatigue.<br /><br />My results were so clear and so noticeable that my parents, husband, brother in law and sister all started a Whole 30 after seeing my success.<br /><br />If someone said to you, try this and you will feel better a month from now would you do it?<br /><br />Yes I lost weight. Yes I lost my sugar cravings. Yes I lost my joint paint and muscle tension. Yes I sleep better. Yes my skin looks brighter and more clear. Yes I am happier. Yes I have lost that \\"always hungry\\" feeling. Yes I have broken my bad habits. And it only took 30 days.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I never read any of the books and was afraid that this film might be just for teens but it really surprised me.  I loved the cast and I enjoyed the action scenes and the special effects. My only objection is that so much of it took place at night and it was hard to see in the dark.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great resource plus I like the traditional Hangman game on the home page.  Really works well on the Kindle and it's also available from the web on my computer.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Well written but bit too predictable and convenient.  There was no struggle for the protagonist.  Grisham's characters always win in the end but there is usually some intrigue.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I was absolutely happy with the headset when I first purchased it at an electronics chain store for around $80.  Worked well for the first couple years, with moderate use, and then the noise started cutting out on the right and then left side.  Having no excessive wear or abuse, the headphone side of the volume control box wiring was broken.  They made the PS3 end of the wiring very sturdy and then used the flimsiest wires for the headset side.  Having worked in the electronics manufacturing industry for years, this is a cheap manufacture, designed to fail.  For the money, I am disappointed with the product and would not recommend this to anyone else.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I love it and the music is out of this world.
B009L32R5I|5.0|I wasn't a Genesis fan until a few years ago.  A friend got me into early Genesis, starting with ?..and Then there Were Three and Trick of the Tail. Steve Hackett is an amazing guitar player and when I saw Genesis Revisited on Amazon, I had to have it.  What a great album.  Then I got an email saying Genesis Revisited II was out.  Right away I got it.  WOW! Even better than the first.  Ripple and Afterglow are just 2 of my favorite Genesis pieces.  Steve Hackett does wonderful interpretations of them. Afterglow sounds similar, to me, like the version on the Wind and Wuthering Genesis album.  Afterglow is my favorite on Hacketts album so far. Steve Hackett has done a suburb job putting his interpretation into the pieces while keeping each piece recognizable.  It's what I liked about Genesis Revisited.  Genesis Revisited II is similar in that respect.  If your a Genesis fan and like Steve Hackett, I say it's a buy.  Enjoy!

B009GEBBNQ|4.0|we enjoyed it thoroughly, but i guess i was hoping for a little more.  the \\"space invaders\\" were a little too over the top.  it does keep well with the avengers storyline overall though, and robert downey jr carries the show again.

B00902MCVY|5.0|A powerful, flawless album.  The time spent since the last album has produced demonstrable results.  This is one of the strongest albums to come out of the genre in recent years.  If you don't believe me, take a listen on Youtube.
0525953728|5.0|This was one of the best books I've have ever read hands down.  Thanks goes out to former US Navy Seal \\"Mark Owen\\" who had the courage to write his first hand account of that day.  After reading this book I now have a much greater respect for these very elite warriors and how they put their lives on the line for all of us without hesitation.  A truly remarkable read that has a great flow to it.  SEAL TEAM SIX KICKS ASS!!!

B000EWD1KK|5.0|\\" The Secret Life Of Walter Mitty \\" is defiantly a comedy classic. For all those Danny Kaye fans this movie will land in your top 5 favorite Danny Kaye.<br /><br />For all those who are unfamiliar with Danny Kaye and have yet to see this movie, allow me to enlighten you.<br /><br />  The plot: Murder. A book of hidden treasure. Is it reality or a dream when adventure comes knocking,or in Mitty's (Kaye's) case driving up in a cab.<br /><br />  Story Line: Walter Mitty is an executive in a big billboard commercial company, who has a habit of slipping into daydreams. Mitty's life is run by his boss, his mother, his fiancee, his soon to be mother-in-law, and his fiancee's want-to-be suitor. To escape his reality, Walter Mitty's imagination takes off, altering him into the man he wishes he could be.<br />  Each dream phase has a different storyline with Mitty in the spotlight.<br />Though the back ground theme changes,three things remain; Walter Mitty has a man of action, his theme song<br />\\" de-pock-it-tit de-pock-it-tit de-pock-it-tit,\\" and the girl of his dreams(Virgina Mayo).<br />  Walter Mitty is taken for a spin when the girl of his dreams and he, end up sharing a cab and the girl's companion ends up mysteriously dead. Things get interesting when Mitty's dream girl (Virginia Mayo) starts seeking his help to solve the murder and catch the villain known as \\" The Boot \\". If that is not bad enough the situation steams up when romance between Mitty and his dream girl starts to bloom, as \\" The Boot\\" closes in on them and a hidden treasure.<br />Mitty starts to question reality verses his dream world when Mitty's dream girl disappears.<br />Is Mitty able to become the man of his dreams to safe the woman of his dreams, or will he walk down the aisle and say \\"I do\\" to his controlling fiancee?<br /><br />Laugh your worries away with this hilarious Danny Kaye classic!!!! This movie is good for all ages, and as a late night movie. Watch it once and you won't be sorry. Miss out and it will TRULY BE your loss.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is not written very well, but it sure sucks you in.  I find myself reading and reading in order to get to the next chapter.  Can't put it down.  Christian Grey has got my attention!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't expect to like this book; thought it would be one of those that appealed only to a younger crowd.  Very pleasantly surprised.  Very different and well written.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I find out lots of things about my friends and family, that I wouldn't normally.  This is a good thing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is very hard to put down! Once you get started the action intensifies in plenty of thrilling change ups it gives you no choice but to read the next one.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After slogging through this tale of distasteful characters (the only one I liked was the female detective), I was furious at the \\"ending.\\" The writing is great; that's why I kept going. I'm angry at the author for leaving us hanging. I was going to buy more of her books, but won't now - unless maybe there's a sequel to \\"Gone Girl.\\" Then I'll reconsider.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I purchased this for my sons iPad. My son has autism and he has trouble holding the smaller stylists and breaking them. This is so easy to use and sturdy. I can even use it on my android phone!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Although the story line had great opportunities and was very well planned, I found the three books very poorly written. It was like the author researched a word that fit her description and used it in overkill until a new word was established... although I did enjoy the read of all three books, the loose ends were tied and the plot was established well they read like they were written by a very young novist author, not all established writer.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Action right from the beginning. Great laughs. Good guys - Bad guys. Loved It.  From start to finish, this movie had me.  I don't see how anyone could be disappointed with this movie.

B006GHA9QQ|1.0|This was a real disappointment. Wish I had previewed it before I bought it.<br />Stick with the original production. Too bad ALW didn't.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|My favorite author returns with a heavy dose of sarcasm and witticism . An enjoyable read and insight into what's happening in the Middle East ,particularly Yemen. John Corey and Paul Brenner give us a double dose of intrigue , excitement and macho ism . The ending is quite \\"khathartic\\" Always waiting in anticipation for Nelson DeMille's next work.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series surprised me with how much I liked it. It's well written with engaging characters, and I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|As an adult coming to this book I already knew about myself but had not accepted a label on my particular temperament.  If for nothing else, this book was good for telling me, this is who you are and there's nothing wrong.  That said, I bumped into a lot of social furniture growing up and into the person I am.  So the book's focus on what parents can do to help their introverted kids to discover who they are and what their strengths are, is very valuable.  And yes, I see myself in both my kids who are creative and out of the box thinkers.  Frankly, I am not sure I'd want it any different.  I can only wish that the more extroverted society would pay attention.  Introversion, like left handedness and many other traits, is just an example of the infinite variability of any species and it should be celebrated.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This is one of the most interesting science fiction books I've read in quite a while. It's more of a mystery than a science fiction piece, and the way Crouch combines these elements is really cool. The author's voice is extremely refreshing. If you are looking for something different to read, this book will definitely satisfy you.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|I can only give 4 stars for one reason. I haven't completed the program for any length of time. I will update my results!<br /><br />Unlike many of the people that have left reviews, I was fairly knowledgeable of the nutrition aspects (no offense). The advice and specific directions were top notch, and when some of the directions weren't supported by direct scientific studies or evidence Michael Matthews said so, but also gave his reasoning and any supportive information and personal experience.<br /><br />I would draw a few main points:<br /><br />If you can measure it, you can control it. This is calories, protein or your own body. Follow this good advice and track your diet and your own body.<br /><br />Pay attention to your body! If something doesn't work, give it a bit of a tweak! Everyone is a little different.<br /><br />Any product that he endorses are not the most expensive, but what has worked for him.<br /><br />I would give the author himself 6 stars. I emailed a few questions about my schedule and the best time to train. He emailed me the next morning and fully answered my questions, and asked a few of his own. He was extremely friendly, helpful and encouraging.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|works great simple and effective whenever you need it highly recomend it great calculator don't have anything bad to say.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like how the higher currency (gold) is easier and cheaper to get. You can breed many different dragons, and evolve them with food and the Evolution Temple. You can only gift one thing which is good, but only three people can get your gold. Nothing expires, unlike other TeamLava games, which is really nice for a change. :) I think this a good game! Play it quite often throughout the day
B00428ZRFY|5.0|Exceeded my expectations. Absolutely love this deluxe edition. Love every song on this cd. Rhianna did it again.the DVD is incredible a good background about her album.
B007TK77QE|5.0|The story line is simple the essential quality of the book is the cast of characters their individual  circumstances and interaction..

034580404X|5.0|The books are more than just SEX. I loved the actual story line & characters!! Want MORE!!! Yes there is lots of sex & sex talk, but the story line is what actually pulled me in. I couldn't put the books down once I started & left me wanting more when I had finished all of them. Can't wait for more on these characters!
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|Light, quick & easy read.  Main character reminded me of lead in Shopaholic series.  Most of it is predictable, but there is one twist that I didn't see coming.  Comparable to a light, romantic comedy movie.
B009KHCT94|1.0|When playing this suck-fest play it at fast forward You won't miss anything. Not funny , bad in every way .
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a joyful, Tearful reading of a phenomenon seen through the eyes of a skeptic scientific mind. Great read!
B004YF6MHW|1.0|This is an outdated release of an outstanding product. Amazon has not updated the version of this since 3.5.2! The current version is 4.0.2 available on Play. If Amazon wants to be taken seriously as a point of purchase for Android apps, it should at least keep current with releases of products!
B00005JLR8|3.0|Not very good sound. Was good for a copy but lacked sound quality. Had to turn T V way up!
B003R50FRI|5.0|An unbelievable story but true. It is so captivating that it is hard to imagine the life in these almost 1000 pages actually happened. Gregory David Roberts certainly has a way with the written word and it is so compelling that the depth and breadth of the novel is exhilarating. I stumbled upon this book by chance on my kindle and am so glad I purchased it to read. It has all the makings of being turned into a majestic film. Do yourself a favour and listen to the over 600 reviews here and buy this book to read. You won't regret it.
B0042YHC38|3.0|Good choice. I like it, and I wear it on my daily workout.<br />It's only problem is that the armband is a little too big for me. This particular issue is uncomfortable as I have to maintain a certain arm position to keep it from falling off; too bad they did not think that petites would also want to listen to music while exercising. Quality is good and everything else was just as expected.
B0068THAGY|1.0|Watched this because it was produced by Spielberg. Have found that this is not a good way to select movies - too many losers such as this one (also '1941,' 'War Horse,' and War of the Worlds'). A '60 Minutes' interview with Spielberg suggested the reason - turns out Spielberg had problems in his relationship with his father, and was overly caring for his mother (had left his father for another man).<br /><br />Regardless, the 'plot' here involved a group of friends making a super 8 movie who witness a train crash while filming at night. Inexplicable events begin to take place in town (dogs and people disappear), their biology teacher is somehow involved, and the Air Force imposes an informal martial law control. Too much sci-fi silliness ruins even the chance of this movie being a charming story of teen-age relationships.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The book is good but meant for a mature reader, I don't think this is a teen book even though I know a lot of teens reading it. I enjoyed all the books they sucked you in and kept you thinking about what would happen next or wonder what really happen to Christian Gray.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I am sorry to give this review, but this book is such a bore, that I can't even finish it!!  I painstakingly made it to 20% in the book and simply cannot go any farther.<br />I hate to begin a book and not finish it, but take my advice and do not waste your money purchasing this book.  What a disappointment after Harry Potter!!!
B005LAII8A|4.0|\\"Looper\\" (2012 release; 118 min.) brings the (initially rather complicated) story of Joe Simmons (played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a contract killer in Kansas, Year 2044, who is paid to knock off guys sent back in time from 2074, when time travel was invented and immediately outlawed, and used illegally by \\"the bad guys\\". Then one day, the guy sent back from 2044 is none other than the older Joe himself (now played by Bruce Willis). Young Joe can't pull the trigger (literally) and so old Joe runs away. It's not possible that two of the same person are running around, so something must be done about it. There are a number of subplots, too long to explain.<br /><br />When I say that this \\"threw me for a loop\\", I'm being facetious of course, although it did take me a while before I truly understood what all was going on. That said, once that Bruce Willis comes into the picture after about half an hour or so, the story really picks up and kept my attention all the way through. Much had been made about the make-up of Gordon-Levitt to make him look like a younger Bruce Willis, but it never struck me that he looks \\"just\\" like a younger Bruce Willis. Not that it matters one way or another. Also I didn't realized until the credits rolled that the role of Sarah is played by Emily Blunt, even though I saw her earlier this year in The Five year Engagement, as well as in Your Sister's Sister.<br /><br />As others have noted, this movie brings a much appreciated fresh perspective on the sci-fi genre, but I will say more, namely that this is a great movie that will be appreciated by anyone, not just sci-fi fans. \\"Looper\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B002RI98BA|5.0|As the moment approached when Wilkes-Booth was to shoot the President I had the strangest desire for history to be different. Although I knew the outcome, as we all do, in light of what I had read about him, I felt incredibly strongly that Booth should miss or Lincoln should survive. The tension the author creates is palpable. I have not read any other detailed biography of Lincoln and am not in a position to judge if the inferences the author draws are all correct. However, upon the facts she asserts it is clear that this President was the most exceptional character. His monumental legacy is wholly justified. I once visited the Lincoln Memorial and wondered if the size of the statue wasn't excessive. Now I know why he is represented as this giant figure. This book is engrossing not only in relation to its principal character but also as social history. The authors style is simple and very easy to read. I enjoyed this book from the first word to the last and recommend it highly. Enjoy!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another excellent book by De Mille.<br />John Corey continues to be one of my favorite characters. Looking forward to his next adventure!
0446580848|5.0|The Panther by Nelson Demille is a continuation of the John Corey saga. A former NYPD homicide detective, Corey's new career in the FBI Anti-Terrorist Task Force once again has him face to face with Al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen.  Written in Demille's engaging narrative style, the book is a page-turner that keeps you wanting more, and I always end up reading his books far too quickly.<br /><br /> In this book, as in the last, I am a little troubled that the Corey character is able to accept a mission that puts his wife, FBI agent Kate Mayfield, in such a dangerous position. He doesn't seem to mind her being sent to Yemen at his side, although he is at least a little aware that she would certainly be a target of some really nasty folks. I don't know many real-life husbands who would welcome the opportunity to place the love of their lives in just jeopardy. It makes me find the wise-cracking Corey character a little less engaging than he would have been if he showed a bit of concern for Kate's well-being.<br /><br />The other issue that I have with this book is that one is well over halfway through it before there is much of the shoot-em-up action that Demille does so well.  The book will do well with Nelson Demille fans and it introduces a new set of CIA villains for Corey and Mayfield to combat in the next book in this series.<br />[[ASIN:0446580848 The Panther (John Corey)]]

B009NQKPUW|3.0|I believe that Ridley Scott has been living off of his laurels since making Blade Runner, probably his best and most original film.  Gladiator wasn't bad but Russell Crowe made that movie.  It seems that every time he makes a movie it gets lots of (undeserved) attention.  This movie doesn't  have the visceral atmosphere and excitement of the first two Alien movies, which were sheer fun to watch.  In fact it is rather dull and attempts to be 'deep,' which is part of its problem.  I'm not sure we care all that much about these big white men coming to earth to create us.<br /><br />The special effects are fabulous.  But there are enough holes in the plot to drive a spaceship through.  I didn't get the part about the attack on the ship from those two dumb scientists who were left behind because of the storm and then possessed by the alien entities.
B0089PJFFY|5.0|I adore Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl and have read it multiple times over the years. Anne's diary has come to mean different things to me as I've grown older - when I first read it as a ten-year-old girl, I was fascinated by the hidden life she led with her family and there was a sense of dread and excitement about her precarious circumstances, the danger of being discovered. When I read Anne's diary again as a teenager, I came to empathize with Anne's frustrations with her mother and the other adults around her whom Anne felt did not understand her and treated her as a child. I felt Anne's desire to be 'heard' and not just treated as an inconvenience or child was so much aligned with what I was going through during adolescence.<br /><br />When I re-read the diary as an adult, I came to appreciate all the other things - the tragedy of having lost such an amazing and talented young voice in the most horrible of circumstances; the beauty of Anne's writing which is all the more amazing given how young she was when she wrote this diary; and the themes of alienation, fear, and hope. Now, as the mother of a young daughter, I read this diary again and gain another fresh perspective - of the complex relationship between daughter and mother. Anne had a strained relationship with her mother Edith, and clearly gravitated toward her beloved Pim (father). This was obvious even before Anne and her family were compelled to move into hiding in the Annex. As a mother, reading Anne's thoughts about her mother (often unflattering) was a disconcerting experience, though things do improve somewhat later on.<br /><br />Anne Frank's Diary of a Young Girl is a classic not only of Holocaust literature, but also a classic Young Adult read with its myriad themes that will appeal to both adolescents and adult readers.
B007THA4FI|1.0|Filled with unlikeable characters that are hard to keep straight, Rowling has squandered her considerable talent on this incredibly boring, difficult-to-finish book. A diagram of who is who in Pagford would have been helpful, but without characters to care about, A Casual Vacancy has left me...um...vacant, and longing for Harry, Ron and Hermione. I have two friends, one a librarian, that simply chose not to finish, rather than struggle through the mire any longer.

B0058Z4NR8|3.0|Sharing the gains from trade:<br />This very interesting book would be more convincing if the authors were more balanced and gave due consideration to sharing of the gains from trade between the \\"paragon\\" that seems to be the England and its trading partners.<br /><br />If the governance model based on the English Glorious Revolution of 1688 is the best why was it that the benefits do not extend to the trading partners, such as Portugal, the \\"oldest ally\\"?

B001HNE3NO|4.0|The history lesson was very informative.  I had not heard about the French camps and their collaboration with the German's horrible treatment of the Jews.  So sad!  The story of Sarah and her family and her life after escaping was a little confusing and I didn't like how it ended.  The story of Julia and Bertrand was also a little vague and I didn't like how it ended either.  I did like the way the author switched back and forth from Sarah's life to Julia's life and then they finally blended together.  I would recommend this book to others.

0761171703|5.0|Full Disclosure: I've known Jordan since 2005. I was happy to assist him on a few shoots for Dancers Among Us, brainstorming ideas, and trying to get every dancer I knew to work with him. If you believe that taints my ability to give a decent review, I suppose I understand. But I'd argue I'm the perfect person to give a review because I can promise you that these pictures are real. The sweat, passion, and commitment of each dancer is real. The sheer talent of the photographer is real. And the power of this book is real.<br /><br />Even being close to this project, I was in no way prepared for how completely this book would consume me once I finally had it in my hands. I looked at the website dozens of times, I saw some of these shoots first hand, and there were still images that were new, that surprised me, made me laugh, and some that took my breath away. I stayed awake for several hours getting completely lost in each page, feeling my heart swell. Even if I spent some time thinking, \\"Oh, I wish I looked like that\\" (these bodies are amazing!), I spent more time thinking, \\"Oh, I've felt like that.\\" The situations in the book are so recognizable and are divided into sections depicting things we all do: Dream, Love, Play, Explore, Grieve, Work, and above all, Live.<br /><br />Jordan has included background stories for several pictures, and anecdotes from his own life so you can see how personal and heartfelt the creation of this book was. The pictures would be remarkable on their own, but it is so much more meaningful to know how much went into devising each shot - or how some of them seemingly created themselves. I can say it was a privilege to witness the enthusiasm, dedication, and courage of these dancers firsthand. I watched Carrie Nicastro jumping off the side of Buckingham Fountain over 200 times during the course of almost 2 hours (page 36). Marissa Horton didn't think twice before stripping down and jumping into Lake Michigan in October when we suggested a nighttime skinny-dip (page 78). Erin Clyne leaped across active train tracks with the Northbound Metra train speeding towards her (page 172). Kara Lozanovski rolled herself in oily, gritty asphalt (page 148). Over and over again dancers volunteered, saying, \\"Yes!\\" or \\"I'll try!\\" or \\"What if...?\\". Improvising, thinking on their feet, and all the time willing to give their all just to share their love for dance. This book is a testament to humankind's best potential for creativity, spontaneity, and collaborative spirit.<br /><br />I remember a lecture from an art history class about the difference between photography and painting; the gist was that photography captures a moment as it is and painting captures a moment as it could be. With \\"Dancers Among Us\\" Jordan and his amazing team of dancers manages to do both. These images freeze a single moment in time - some of them as mundane as sitting on a park bench, crossing the street, or drinking a cup of coffee - but fill it with all of the life, emotion, and power that sits, too often unseen, inside each of us.
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is an excellent app for my FireHD. The app is laid out for easy user experiences and contains a lot of different content. If I had paid for the app, then it would be rated less stars. The reason for that, is I would still be getting day old news, only having paid for this right. But, it was free, so how can you complain about it.<br />In all, this is an excellent app. For me, it's nice to have a look at how some Europeans view what's going on it the world as opposed to what our press is showing. Sometimes I even find huge differences in perspectives (lol). The only thing better would be is if the news were on a current feed.

B002KYHZLQ|5.0|With the Malazan Book of the Fallen series, Steven Erikson has created on of the best fantasy worlds i have ever experienced. The first book might be a bit much at times, as it introduces a lot of characters and various story lines, but they all neatly tie up in the end and over the entire series all characters are explored and explained in depth. Steven Erikson does not spend 200 pages on pagantry, he describes the important parts of scenery and surroundings, but then he moves on to narrating events and dialogue. His characters talk frequently, and when they do they sound real, with all the emotions one could expect and hope for.<br /><br />I can highly recommend the entire series to any fantasy fan out there, and the first book is a fun and entertaining read.

A \\"Feel Good\\" Movie With Heroes Who Win In The End....But With Both Class And Depth!<br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />The odds of a movie project ending up as good as The Seven Samaurai (1954) ended up (one of the best of the best in all movie history) are the same as the odds of a couple trying to conceive a child (\\"make a baby\\") who, they hope, ends up being a world class artist like Shakespeare or Michaelangelo<br /><br />When a movie ends up being as much of a winner as this movie was (is), it must be treasured, and certainly screened over and over and over by anyone who cares for cinema.<br /><br />It's so good, there's no way to say how good it is really....one can only comment, state emphatically, that it's wonderful, and thank heaven for that.<br /><br />Everything is right, everything works...the script, the direction, the acting, the set decoration, the camera work, the editing.....let me count the ways.<br /><br />The depiction of violent, out of control weather elements in The Seven Samaurai 1954) is memorable.<br /><br />The story characters face a hostile, severe physical world, only sometimes gentle and cooperative, but often brutal and oppressive.<br /><br />Kurasawa, the director, used the sounds and image of violent pouring water in Rashomon (1950) from which players in the movie were forced to huddle. We see this again in The Seven Samaurai (1954).<br /><br />We see drenching down-pouring rain pouring torrentially over the fragile retreats where movie characters huddle. We see characters wallowing in deep, oppressive mud and large, deep mud puddles which dominate the landscape and the world where the story is set. Violent winds blow across the land, bending young trees and old ones alike, and creating dust clouds, lifting dirt into the air. Thick mist and fog are part of rain soaked vistas, all part of the rural Japan setting.<br /><br />The violent, pounding hoof beats of the villain bandit horses are heard throughout the movie, and the power of the horses themselves are shown brilliantly. The villains are well equipped and powerful in ways the hero Samaurai cannot match. The power of the horses, and the horsemen who ride the horses (bandits) are depicted memorably.<br /><br />Japan has a great tradition of stage acting and stage drama, and the movie actors part of the story come from that world, and do very well in front of the camera. We see wonderful character actors and dramatic actors alike.<br /><br />One of the most memorable parts of the movie is simply the way the actors run with great speed and power....actors of both genders seen running relatively short distances, but with great urgency, purpose, and sheer physical power. One seldom sees people running with the skill and dramatic meaning frequently depicted in The Seven Samaurai (1954).<br /><br />The two headline people part of the movie, Akira Kurasawa (the director) and Toshiro Mifune (the lead actor), went on to stormy futures after the movie was made and rightly heralded as a permanent world classic in 1954, now (2012) almost 60 years ago.<br /><br />Just like Orson Welles after Citizen Kane (1941).<br /><br />Movies are one of the great art forms ever in human history, and this movie proves that is so.<br /><br />Watch it, again and again and again.....you'll never be sorry.<br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG-AFTRA movie actor.beats of the villain bandit horses are heard throughout the movie, and the power of the horses themselves are shown brilliantly.

1455519006|4.0|Most thrillers start sounding the same after a few pages.  Robie establishes a different vibe from the first chapter.  He makes you want to understand him even though you know you can't (as Agent Vance says later in the book).  I thought Julie was a stretch.  As a character, she was pretty unrealistic.  Her dialogue was a bit unusual and stilted.<br />Overall, the storyline was solid, although somewhat predictable.  Either way, I listened to the 12.5 hours of the audio version with great interest.  -SG
B0082EOJYE|2.0|\\"The Artist\\" Won The 2011 Best Picture Academy Award: ....Was this good news?<br /><br />I have my doubts......<br /><br />I'm a SAG Actor and follow the Academy Awards yearly, and comment here about \\"The Artist\\" (2011) winning the Best Picture award recently (Feb. 2012).<br /><br />This is not an American movie, as neither Hamlet (1948) nor SlumDog Millionaire (c. 2008) were, either. That is worthy of comment, and perhaps protest.<br /><br />I doubt that either of the two main actors, or the director speak fluent English, or English without a thick foreign accent. Yet the main actors portrayed Americans in a movie where their voices are (almost) never heard....it's a \\"silent movie\\" with a music and sound effects sound track, but almost no dialog.<br /><br />Several older USA actors (John Goodman and James Cromwell) are included as supporting actors, neither in major or key parts.<br /><br />This movie is a clever movie, very well done with set decoration, costuming, and camera work, but not at all ideal regarding it's story and screenplay. It's important to like the main actors (even the villains) from the start of the movie, and, at least for me, this didn't happen. The main male character....he got a Best Actor Award from the Academy....didn't \\"fetch me,\\" and I always think that is mandatory if one is to rate the movie top drawer.<br /><br />THE ARTIST (2012) is this year's big deal movie......not my choice, but I don't control things. Based on A STAR IS BORN movies and story, done 3 times....1937 starring Janet Gaynor and Frederick March (I screened it last night......sappy...Fred commits suicide at the end of the movie....Janet carries on bravely by not leaving Hollywood, stays on as a movie star!), 1954 starring Judy Garland and James Mason (Judy got a Best Actress Academy Award for that movie, which I've never seen), and finally Barbra Streisand in the 1970's with Kris Kristofferson, I think. Never saw that, either.<br /><br />Same story in all three movies.....old time older actor getting dissed and not hired any more marries an unknown young, up and coming girl who becomes a bigger star than he was and isn't any more....she stays loyal to her older husband to the end!<br /><br />THE ARTIST (2012) has a happy ending, different from at least the 1937 movie....don't know how the other two 1954 and 1970's STAR IS BORN movies ended...maybe happy, too.<br /><br />Well........<br /><br />The Academy Awards voters gave us SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE as \\"Best Picture\\" recently and it shows how capricious the whole thing is.<br /><br />I own a great retrospective book analyzing the history of the awards, and the politics part of it all.....book is titled THE REAL Oscar (1981 or so)....which is good to page through....the history of the whole thing up to 1981 (it started in 1929).<br /><br />It's all about glitz and jazzy outfits and celebrities quipping, etc. etc. Show biz putting on a night of show biz.<br /><br />I also own a pretty good documentary about it all titled OSCAR'S GREATEST MOMENTS (1991) which shows the history of the show from 1970 through 1990.<br /><br />It's a big institution over the years.....83 years by now!

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I am biased because I liked the movie. It has a good mix of action, interesting personalities, and great interaction and humor between the main characters. That said, this is a great deal. You get Blu-Ray plus DVD of the movie and a decent amount of features. On top of that, you get a 3D Blu-Ray disk, free digital download of the movie (standard def but real download instead of the crummy Ultra-Violet crap), and free digital download of the film's soundtrack (not the original instrumental tracks, the various rock band performances). All of the material is interesting and adds some value to those interested in more than just the movie. A very cool feature is the free app that will synch the Blu-Ray version of the film to your iPad. You can control the movie as you see bonus content on the iPad...very cool.<br /><br />Bottom line: great value for the price...and a darn good action movie.

He went on to win a Best Actor Academy Award for Stalag 17 (1953) and was future USA President Ronald Reagan's best man at Reagan's 1952 shot-gun, justice of the peace wedding to his pregnant bride, Nancy Davis (Reagan's daughter, Patty Davis, who went on to pose nude for Playboy Magazine, was born 7 months after the wedding...the bride, Nancy Davis, was later first lady of the USA Nancy Reagan...\\"good girls go to heaven...bad girls go everywhere!\\").<br /><br />Holden went on to die alone in a humiliating way in the early 1980's (found dead for days alone in his apt.), and Reagan went on to be USA President....occupied the White house when Holden was found dead.<br /><br />Holden became what he portrayed. This happens a lot in the movies. A word to the wise for movie stars and other actors...be careful what roles you play....you may end up playing these roles in real life.<br /><br />Gloria Swanson plays an old lady in this movie, and still hadn't reached age 50. Compare her with Cher, roughly the same age in Moonstruck (1987) who won a Best Actress Academy Award which included romantic nude sex bedroom scenes with much younger Nicholas Cage (roughly the same age as William Holden when Holden acted in Sunset Blvd. [1950]).<br /><br />Cher stayed gorgeous in her 40's, became the mother of a famous homosexual daughter turned \\"male\\" first named \\"Chastity,\\" then re-named \\"Chaz,\\" not a bit as pretty as Mom...bad weight problem, among other problems. That's Hollywood!<br /><br />Swanson and Cecil B. DeMille both acted in Sunset Blvd. (1950) and both were very good. Two of the biggest major players in silent era world cinema history....this movie is worth seeing just to look at them, see them talk, see why they were so good at what they did.<br /><br />The final scene shows the hero getting shot in the back....by the other hero in the movie.<br /><br />No epic is big enough for two heroes. Keep that in mind if you're a hero.<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.roblems. That's Hollywood!<br /><br />Swanson and Cecil B.

B004BEMC6G|5.0|Salt (2010 Columbia) starring Angelina Jolie and directed by Philip Noyce is a duplication and update of a well done French classic movie make in 1990 titled La Femme Nikita (1990 France) starring Anne Parillaud and directed by Luc Beeson.<br /><br />See the \\"Alternatiave Ending\\" version of this movie.....it's better, makes better sense, should have been chosen as the \\"primary\\" or \\"main\\" version of the movie released to movie houses. The Alternative version ending is very intelligent and satisfying in a way the \\"official,\\" \\"main\\" version of the movie is not. Nuff said!<br /><br />Well....more about that....(to drive the point home!)......<br /><br />The \\"Alternative Ending\\" version of \\"Salt\\" (2010) available on DVD's with several variations of the movie is the best one, and all interested in the great \\"Salt\\" movie should see that version, rather than the version which was released to the movie houses in 2010, and which is the \\"default\\" \\"official,\\" and \\"main\\" version viewers see unless they visit the \\"special features\\" section of the DVD of \\"Salt\\" and choose the \\"alternative ending.\\"<br /><br />To get back to the comparison of \\"Salt\\" (2010) with \\"La Femme Nikita\\" (1990), both movies are about beautiful females who look like high fashion ramp models, both unusually underweight with exotic faces and thick, sensuous lips, who are recruited, manipulated, forced to become government assassins, and who murder many innocent people in cold blood 'doing their job\\" during the course of the story and the movie, but in the end \\"jump ship\\" and escape from their government manipulator puppet-masters, and disappear at the end of both movies to an unknown and uncertain future....the price both women pay for escaping from their roles as forced government assassins.<br /><br />Both movies demonstrate and assert that the classical \\"femme fa tale\\" may be part of a story which has almost nothing to do with romance or connection with any male, and also that the female protagonist in an action/ mystery story (both Salt and La Femme Nikita are action/ mystery stories) can be capable of astonishing feats of physical prowess and strength against male antagonists in which the female wins physical fights and the males lose....repeatedly.<br /><br />Both Angelina Jolie as \\"Evelyn Salt\\" in SALT and Anne Parillaud (one of the top fashion models in France before she became a movie star) as \\"Nikita\\" retire from the stories both star in \\"undefeated\\" in all serious contests they engage in....the men they come up against always lose, the female protagonists always win.<br /><br />The female protagonists never face female antagonists in either movie, which is significant.<br /><br />The Salt (2010) movie uses a lot of tricky editing and fast paced cutting to assist Angelina Jolie 'do her thing\\" beating up men and doing Harrison Ford style action miracles which would easily kill most people....<br /><br />The La Femme Nikita (1990) movie is smoother, and more believable for that reason, and probably the better of the two movies for that reason.....it is much less a \\"video-game\\" Dark Knight type movie, relies far less on gimmicks and technical/ digital tricks.....<br /><br />Salt (2010) starring Angelina Jolie lacks the needed humorous and human intervals provided in La Femme Nikita (1990). The main female character in Salt (2010) is much less lovable and far more driven...she really does stay \\"on task\\" and is almost a machine as military ideal soldiers are supposed to be. Women may or may not be capable of all the superstar action and heroic stunts Angelina Jolie performs as the \\"Evelyn Salt\\" character, but such ladies are like the napkins neatly folded for wedding anniversaries Angelina Jolie (\\"Salt\\") comments on at the start of the movie...\\"Not too sexy.\\" How true, how true.<br /><br />But Salt is a good movie worth seeing....so, of course is/was La Femme Nikita (1990).<br /><br />The DVD disc version for home viewing I bought included three different versions ofthe movie, including an \\"extended cut\\" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending. I can see why the version ultimately released in movie houses and offered as the \\"official version\\" was chosen. The released version (the \\"official\\" one) is more logical, and the ending is closer to La Femme Nikita (1990 French).<br /><br />Both Salt (2010) and La Femme Nikita (1990) examine the potential and unexpected physical and mental power of beautiful females built like super-models one sees on Vogue Magazine covers, and almost never in Hollywood (or French) action movies.<br /><br />Both are good movies. We need more just like them....odd that it took 20 years for Salt (2010) to pick up where La Femme Nikita (1990) left off.<br /><br />--------<br /><br />Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.the movie, including an \\"extended cut\\" which showed and alternative ending and at least one key part earlier in the movie changed to fit the alternative ending.

B008QTVNUI|2.0|'Homeland' is the US version of an Israeli show \\"Prisoners of War'.  I'd heard so much about 'H' that I bought it--but then realized during episode 2 that it was a copy,,,except: It's been sexed up and violenced up for US production.  Where the Israeli version seemed to focus on relationships (the Israelis were hostage for 17 years) and what happens at homecoming, the US version veers into politics.  While there were two Israeli survivors, the US 'hero' is an amalgam of not only them but also of the dead Israeli...and 'our' female FBI agent is an amalgam of several Israeli characters, including the 'dead' soldier's sister, who has a psychotic episode when she realizes he's dead.  The 'messed up' teen girl isn't just messed up in the Israeli version--she has affairs with men old enough to be her father, and this is made explicit and related to her missing father.  All in all, the US version pales in comparison.  I stopped watching the US version when the 'hero' tries on a suicide vest and talks about blowing his own head off...unnecessary and sick.  All in all, the Israeli version grabs you by the gut and the US version punches you in the gut.  While I haven't seen the second season of the Israeli show, I will look for it...but not 'H'.
B003N0XDT4|2.0|STOP.  Do you need this product?  Why?  Do you need it because of the studio headphones you have are like 250ohms or something?  Or, are you buying this because you are chasing a dragon, and you don't really know what you're doing?  That's what I was doing.  I hoped that buying this product would drastically improve the sound quality of my system.  I have a beyerdynamic dt770 pro 80 ohms studio headphones, macbook pro 2012, sony mdr 5600 studio headphones, and an ipod.  I'm a terrible laptop dj/sound enthusiast, can't say I'm a legit audiophile in terms of technical knowledge, but I try.  Anyways, I can honestly say I don't notice THAT much of a different with this product.  I guess its best for the Ipod, but if I could return it I would. Not a total waste of money because someday it might be nice to split a signal so that me AND a friend can listen to something on headphones without losing quality, but yea, in my personal circumstances, I can't really justify buying this product.  Many people indicated to me that it was a gamble to buy this product and I warn you the same thing - unless you KNOW that you need this product, you might think twice about it, unless you're super rich and are free to spend frivolously because money is not important to you.  However, a lot of people, that is normal, not rich people, who work hard for their money - they might feel ripped off after buying this and its because they were misinformed and idealistic about the kind of improvement this would make.
0385737955|5.0|Everybody runs out of good books. But if you have not read the book, \\"The Maze Runner,\\" you are in for a surprise.  \\"The Maze Runner,\\" has action, suspense, even some mystery. You will not want to put it down; it is so good.  If you want a good book, this is the perfect one.<br /> Like I said at the beginning, we all run out of good books.  But this book will keep you interested and hooked with the conflict and characters that will keep you interested.  The main characters are Thomas, Newt, Teresa, Minho, and Chuck, who range in ages from 12 to 18 years old.  For some unknown reason, they only remember their names and they can't remember their past lives. They have all been sent to the Glade, a place with a huge maze around it, sometime in the future.  They have to work together and trust each other to get out of the Glade and get their revenge on the Creators, the people who put them in the Maze.  They also have something else driving them: the need to find out why they were sent there, (not just anybody) and what happened in their past.<br />  I like to play video games, and in some video games your character needs to think quickly, solve puzzles, use skills to move on and such.  This book's characters do, also.  Thomas, one of the main characters, must solve the puzzle of the Maze and survive the deadly Grievers (half-monster half-robot creatures that come out at night).  All the action will keep you reading.  The author just has an awesome writing style.  He packs in a lot of suspense and action, which keeps you focused and interested throughout the whole book. He also includes details that help you picture what is happening and understand better what is going on.  The book is fast-paced and suspenseful; you'll never want to stop.<br /> Everybody likes stimulating plot twists and climaxes, interesting and resourceful characters, and fascinatingly dangerous environments.  I think, \\"The Maze Runner\\" offers all of these and so much more.  You will love it because it provides so many different ideas and conflicts that are usually spread out throughout a book series, but this book provides everything in one. It also has an excellent life lesson; you can achieve more when you work together as a team.  These characters were only able to figure out the mystery of the Maze, and some other issues and mysteries, when they worked together as a team maximizing the knowledge, skills and abilities they each possessed individually.  Without one another, they wouldn't have been to even come close to what they were able to achieve together.<br /> In conclusion, this book is great. I guarantee that most people would like it, because it has many twists, plots and problems that most books can not fit into one book.  It keeps you interested the whole time; there is almost no time when you are bored with what is happening. I believe that if you read this book you will remember it as one of the best you've ever read.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|As always, anything with Judy Dench in it has to be good. I read the book and loved it, and was anxious to see the movie. While the story was changed a little in the movie, it didn't hurt it much, and I enjoyed it.

0786955570|4.0|This is a very simple and straightforward board game themed around the old Ravenloft D&D campaign setting. It's basically a combination of high fantasy and horror---think dwarves and elves battling werewolves and vampires, and you'll start to get the idea.<br /><br />It's worth noting what this game is not: it is not a role playing game by any stretch of the imagination (wordplay not intended, but I'll take credit for it). Aside from a few lines of flavor text you read at the beginning of each adventure, there isn't much of a sense of character and setting. You won't be going to town to buy equipment, you won't be bargaining with shopkeeps, and you won't be crafting an elaborate back story for your character. Castle Ravenloft is essentially a tile exploration game in which you move your miniature, draw a tile, place a monster figure on it, and roll a die to see if you get hit. Then, on your next turn, you'll attempt bloody revenge, rolling in an effort to make monster stew. Well, maybe not monster stew. Unless you like to eat kobolds. I mean, do what you like, I won't judge you. But eating kobolds, man? Seriously??<br /><br />Ahem, anyhoo, you'll progress through the stack of tiles, eventually reaching a goal tile. The goal tile is usually anywhere from 10-15 tiles deep, and most adventures --the game comes with a good number of different adventures to choose from -- most adventures will feature a \\"boss\\" you'll try to slay once you reach the goal. Along the way you'll draw lots of Encounter cards, which are generally pretty brutal (roll a die and add 8, if it hits you, take a couple damage. Oh and if it misses you, go ahead and take one damage).You'll also get treasure cards, which are rewards a Hero gets for killing a monster. These can be items that provide bonuses to die rolls; sometimes they're \\"blessings\\" which provide an immediate, one-time benefit.<br /><br />That's pretty much it. There are wrinkles here and there-- the different adventures in the provided booklet do a good job mixing up goals and tile layouts-- but overall, the game is somewhat repetitive. Don't expect a lot of tactical choices and depth from Castle Ravenloft.<br /><br />It's worth mentioning that this is a cooperative game. The players don't compete, but rather work together toward a common goal. This ensures that no one has to play the \\"bad guys\\", ie, control the monsters, there are simple instructions printed on each monster card that tell you what the monster does (\\"move next to the closest hero and attack\\".)<br /><br />All this might make it sound like I don't like the game. On the contrary, I do quite like it. It plays in an hour, which is great. It really does provide a cool \\"D&D Lite\\" experience. It looks great on the table. Who doesn't want to play with plastic monsters and heroes?? It also scales well with different numbers of players, being equally good played solo or with the full complement of five players.<br /><br />If you are looking for a quick-playing dungeon crawl, this is the one to get. Just realize what it isn't: it isn't a deep tactical exercise, and it isn't a role playing game. But if you like the theme, you'll enjoy it.

B0083P1QUM|5.0|This is Patricia Cornwell's best book so far. I don't like books that have a predicable ending, and this was certainly in that category. There was a bit less animosity between the characters. In the last couple of books it seemed as though all the characters were angry at each other which made the book less enjoyable for me.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|With plot (!), character and structures ably covered elsewhere, this review is about my experience of David Mitchell's CLOUD ATLAS. I was curious when I started and weeping when I finished. In between, taken heart and soul. Resonating in the background were some of my favorite reading experiences: The majesty and moral character of Melville's MOBY DICK. The gimlet eye and heartbreaking hindsight of Michener's HAWAII. The rich, musical ethos of Elise Blackwell's AN UNFINISHED SCORE. The hardboiled cunning of Elmore Leonard's OUT OF SIGHT. The chilling resonance of George Orwell's 1984. The bleak dystopian vision of Cormack McCarthy's THE ROAD.<br /><br />Each of the six worlds in CLOUD ATLAS vividly awakened sense memories, books, music, movies, conversations, experiences. The nesting doll metaphor is apt for the structure of the novel itself but doesn't talk about the air in between where a willing reader will feel his/her own personal past and future. This is one of those rare books capable of drawing you in on that level.<br /><br />The writing craft is fine, and I mean *fine* fine, as in particularly, specifically, exquisitely made. The range and depth of voices is spectacular; I experienced only a few moments of dialogue fatigue. The storytelling is entertaining and pace-conscious with philosophizing that feels more conversational than preachy. The concept is brilliant without being overworked or parlor-tricky. The infrastructure of the story is a balls-out astonishing accomplishment.<br /><br />I've actually had CLOUD ATLAS on my TBR pile for several years. A review copy was sent to me when the book was originally published, but it's a big book, and I'm always pressed for time. This week, in the hospital for a hysterectomy, I downloaded it to my iPhone because I want to see the movie as soon as I'm up and able. In a weird way, I feel like the book called to me at a rare moment when I was quiet enough to receive it, and I'll always be grateful for that.<br /><br />In the final amazing chapter, Adam, with whom, appropriately, we began the journey, takes us to its resolution, forcing us to despair at the utter darkness, then showing us a redeeming beam of light.<br /><br />Reflecting on all this, Adam says, \\"A life spent shaping a world I want Jackson to inherit, not one I fear Jackson shall inherit, this is a life worth living.\\"<br /><br />Of course, I was already having that same thought about the world my children live in, and as he translated his good intentions into a pragmatic plan of action, I could see myself doing the same. As flaky as this sounds, I felt a sort of rebirth in this story of transmigrating souls, and Lord, I hope that's not just painkillers talking, because I want to take that better self with me into the future. I will. I already have.<br /><br />Bottom line: It's a beautiful, ambitious, spiritual wrecking ball of a book. Probably not for cynics, speed-readers or fundamentalists. Highly recommending for old hippies, young hipsters, anyone open to having their soul stirred and mind blown.<br /><br />A footnote: The Kindle version is one of those sloppy conversions publishers did hastily when ebooks became the thing after 2007ish. Shame on Random House for marring this author's transcendent work with those shoddy production values. But transcend it did. I can't bring myself to deduct a star for the numerous technical errors and anomalies./>In the final amazing chapter, Adam, with whom, appropriately, we began the journey, takes us to its resolution, forcing us to despair at the utter darkness, then showing us a redeeming beam of light.<br /><br />Reflecting on all this, Adam says, \\"A life spent shaping a world I want Jackson to inherit, not one I fear Jackson shall inherit, this is a life worth living.\\"<br /><br />Of course, I was already having that same thought about the world my children live in, and as he translated his good intentions into a pragmatic plan of action, I could see myself doing the same.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|Preface:<br />I've been a fan of Kamelot since I first heard The 4th Legacy.  When I heard this incredible singer, Roy Khan, for the first time in the song, \\"New Allegiance\\" I was completely blown away.  I was already tired of the cliché power metal singers that sound like castrated screaming cats.  Kamelot's unique singer set them apart immediately and they have been defined by their operatically smooth and warm singer.  While many regard The Black Halo as their crowning achievement, my personal favorite album is Karma.  However, Ghost Opera felt like a huge let down.  The songwriting felt rushed... choruses felt truncated and bridges felt shoe-horned in to the songs.  I had hoped Kamelot would right the wrongs from Ghost Opera when they released Poetry for the Poisoned.  I was even more let down with that album.  The mix felt very weak, guitars pushed way to the back to make way for production fluff.  Even the lyrics felt pretty silly at times.  To the point, for the past few years it sounded like Kamelot had lost their passion and instead were just going through the motions churning out mediocre music to support catchy choruses.<br /><br />Review:<br />After Khan left the band, I thought for sure they were done producing music that I'd like.  Oddly enough, around the time of his leaving, by coincidence I started listening to the band, Seventh Wonder.  Tommy Karevik quickly became one of my favorite singers of all time.  His perfect pitch and ear for melodic lines woven throughout very complex progressive music made his band an instant favorite of mine.  If anyone was capable to replacing Roy Khan, it was this guy!  I was cautiously optimistic about what Kamelot would do now that Karevik was in the band.  Would he be allowed to collaborate with the writing or did they just want a singer for hire?  Thankfully, it turned out to be the former.  Kamelot's new album, Silverthorn, is one of the best albums that they've ever released.  I hear the spirit and passion thatwas existent in Karma.  The band is firing on all cylinders and utilizing all of their talents.  Every song on the album is unique and memorable.  The mix perfectly balances the heaviness of the guitars with the lush orchestrations and keyboards, which add to their signature multi-textured depth.  While I was previously pretty harsh on Ghost Opera, it did have a brilliant use of string arrangements adding to the epic vibe of the music.  Silverthorn takes it a step further and even rivals what Nightwish does with their symphonic arrangements.<br /><br />The female guest singers are new to Kamelot and sound great with Tommy's voice.  Being so familiar with Seventh Wonder, I can hear his influence in the writing.  He has this wavering ability switching to falsetto and back at the drop of a hat which gives his delivery a very personal touch.  The keyboards are given a much greater presence on this album than in the past.  You will hear dueling guitar/keys solos frequently.  Drumming is as always stellar.  I don't notice the bass much other than just to support the band.  Each song is strong and there is no filler, unless you want to count Continuum (which is just a light instrumental epilogue).  Stand out tracks for me are: Ashes to Ashes - great unique vibe! My Confession - I just love the chorus!, and Silverthorn - incredible orchestral arrangement!<br /><br />Story: (Spoiler alert)<br />This is a concept album set in the 19th century where two twin brothers accidentally let their little sister, Jolee fall into a river while playing with a kite.  She drowns and the body is never recovered.  Instead of coming clean, the two brothers keep quiet and never reveal the truth about what happened.  They make a pact with each other carving the word \\"Veritas\\" on their chests, as an oath never to speak of this tragedy to anyone.  The album explores the emotional guilt and burden this secret plays on each brother.  One seeks redemption and the other seems to let it eat at his soul until he becomes a monster.  The lyrics of the album primarily deal with the emotions and internal struggle within these brothers.  To get the full story, you need to buy the premium package which comes with a gorgeous hard book printed on thick paper.  The packaging of this CD is incredible and definitely worth the extra money for the special edition.  The artwork is just beautiful and tells a story if you pay attention!<br /><br />I highly recommend this album, particularly if you felt that Kamelot had lost their way since The Black Halo.  Silverthorn is a spectacular achievement!

B005PR44XC|5.0|Michael Lewis makes the subject matter interesting and provides insights into how events unfolded, prior to the bubble bursting in various economies around the world. The information is presented in such a compact manner and makes for very easy reading. I found the events leading up to the property bubble and subsequent burst in Ireland, particularly fascinating. It provides the evidence for the kind of craziness that prevailed everywhere, prior to 2008. The scary part for the average man in the street is that the \\"lone voices of reason\\" who spoke out about what had become very common financial practices, were made a mockery of. And this was not isolated to one or two economies, but was widespread. Loved this book!

B008NEMN0K|4.0|I really wanted to love this because if this turned out to be a winner then the JVC 3D conversion product would be used to convert many older movies, and we'd see an inexpensive onslaught of 3D movies.<br /><br />This was middle of the road +.  There were some weird overlaps of backgrounds and foregrounds (bending of light where the two meet).  There was a slightly flat feel through the entire thing, which ain't good when rating 3D quality.  The high def was very good, even on my 110 inch projection screen, so the package doesn't get the three stars I would have given it based solely on the 3D, but I can't go above a 4 because of the 3D (I think I'm already being generous).<br /><br />I think the process could work, but it still needs more human involvement.  Convert, watch the movie with a critical eye, tweak the conversion, watch again, rinse and repeat...  :)<br /><br />Maybe in the near future we'll have a better automated conversion process so we can get all the classics in 3D before 3D becomes a dead technology (again).  I hope it doesn't, but many movies came out in 3D decades ago and eventually they went bye-bye, so it could happen again.  Of course, the 3D was nothing like it is now, but still, there are many people who don't like wearing the glasses no matter how well they work.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|What a great cd.  This is my first Buddy Guy cd that is not a collection.  I am quite pleased with this purchase.  Everybody who listens to this disc is amazed.  Buddy's blues are so powerfull.  This is not one of those \\"boring \\" blues records where every beat is predictable.  The lyrics are great and you get a real picture of the man's life.  Buy it.
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|Hell's Angels meets Tony Soprano. Just love the action and story line. This is best tried to be believed. It is not something I would pick to watch. It was recommended to me and now I am hooked. Try it!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it really is like the real game.  it allows you to earn more coins quicker when u level up.  trying to fill in the puzzle is a cool twist.  you can start and stop at any point so very convienent for entertainment at anytime.@@
1619695006|1.0|We expected much much better, one hit with the potter series I guess, We hope not, young kids these days need as many chances to read as possible.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very addictive game. Much like ones at the carnival except you don't lose any actual coin. Play all day long.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|i think this game is pretty fun I think it could be better but not too bad for free I guess
0525952926|4.0|After reading \\"The Fall of Giants,\\" I was anxious to see how the story continued.  Ken Follett does his research and has a way of bringing history to life.  Although long, the story moves quickly.  The trilogy should be required reading for all high school or college history students. Can't wait for Book Three.
B005S9EJ14|2.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is noteworthy basically because of the cast. Judi Dench would be interesting reading from a telephone directory and Bill Nighy is endearing no matter what. Tom Wilkison and Penelope Wilton are strong supporters.  And what can be said about Dame Maggie Smith that hasn't been said before? But the rest of the cast and the story line are not at all impressive. Who wants to watch a bunch of senior citizens discovering that the fabled benefits package the UK has promised for all its people isn't at all what they expected? Once the disappointment has set in, they all set off to India for a retirement they can afford. They become acquainted at the airport when it dawns on them that they must find their own way to the hotel despite the promises otherwise.<br /><br />The hotel is another character in the plot as it battles Western expectations. While no one finds the Holiday Inn very appealing to any but the most pedestrian tastes, this place is a little too exotic for those used to indoor plumbing, standard electrical service, or even walls. A young man, very eager to recapture former glory, turns himself upside down to please his guests and this has its comical moments as he struggles to define all deficiencies as unexpected benefits in disguise. It is clear by the words he uses to describe his hotel (The Best Exotic...) that there will be something of a disconnect between the description and reality.<br /><br />Wilkison is the only one familiar with the terrain as he is a closeted gay who once lived in the country. It's vaguely appealing as he explains politely what the customs are although few in his group find them appealing (think of the red hot cuisine). Penelope Wilton who plays the bullying senior we all have come to know and hate, harangues her hubby (the shy lovable type played by Nighy) to take her back immediately. No way, Jose. They invested their last pound on a daughter's start-up company leaving them financially depleted.The bigot, Maggie, can't find a thing to smile about but accidentally shows an unexpected respect for one of the Indian persona non gratas in that stratified world.<br /><br />Each person struggles to right themselves in a foreign country so their declining years won't be the worst of their years. How likely do you think it that our gay fella will come out badly? hmmm? Some succeed and some don't but it's just too obvious who is who. There are some amusing scenes but as someone who just reached sixty, I find the rest is simply too real for comfort. I wish there was something encouraging in this mess but it's just not that good.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I love the little bubbles and the Colorado costimization. it is a good app but I wish it wouldn't open when I plug and unplug the charger.
B008PO8PG4|5.0|Wow, first listen last night. Thought I put in the wrong cd, like phantom of the opera or something from Halloween. It was perfect background music running around the house and handing out treats.<br /><br />Now I need to listen closer in 'repeat' mode all day long. Can't wait.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This review is for the \\"Digital Copy\\".  Don't waste your time.  The hoops that you have to jump through to get to the digital copy are ridiculous. After attempting this process I still was not able  to get the copy.  Save yourself the headache, disregard the advertising bullshit, buy the non \\"Digital Copy\\" version and just rip it yourself.
0452289963|5.0|This book will take you to the next level if your ready. I have bought this book for friends after I read it.
B00003CXB4|1.0|as the title suggests, the disk wouldn't play at certain points. the whole beginning is pretty much unwatchable. I'd say about 20 minutes of it cannot be seen. I felt I was mislead by the product description... who would buy a disk that doesn't work?
B000XJ5TOK|1.0|This version has been edited...I'm guessing..per Millia's request...aka shower scene is almost completely gone.<br />Granted it is a nudity scene yes, however I don't want to pay of something that has been edited down...if I didn't want blood, sex and violence I'd watch network tv.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The Trilogy, while predictable, is very good reading.  You care about the characters and you root for them to be together, and to make it, to the very end.  I read the first book, on a recommendation and immediately had to buy the second book.  Before I finished the second book, I was buying the third.  I was somewhat let down and disappointed that there was no fourth.  If you can get past the steamy portions (I skipped through most of them in book two and three) the storyline and phrasing are excellent.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love the changes now that I can play on my Kindle. I do really wish though that you could gift more than 3 people a day.
B008JIFJ4W|5.0|Michael Angelakos is a fascinating individual. Shortly after I purchased this album, I heard an interview with him on Sound Opinions, and I was kind of blown away with his honesty. Jim and Greg talk to him *at length* about his bipolar disorder and how his mental health issues had dominated his life in recent years.<br /><br />One of the things that's easy to overlook about this album (and Passion Pit in general) is the striking contrast between the sound and the lyrics: the tempo is upbeat, the sound is chipper, the hooks massive - but underneath it all, the lyrics are stark and deeply depressing at times. Passion Pit music feels like an embodiment of Angelakos's own self-described experiences, with echoes of lyrical despair thinly veiled behind a layer of exuberant sound.<br /><br />Let's back up: \\"Gossamer\\" is \\"pop,\\" with a huge dose of electronics thrown in for good measure. This describes a lot of music these days, but even discarding the lyrics, Angelakos injects layers of sound that elevate Passion Pit beyond the standard fare you're likely to hear on Clearchannel. The sound: huge! The hooks: killer! But, as Angelakos says, Passion Pit songs take the \\"long way\\" to get there, and the payoff is all the greater for it.<br /><br />Bottom line: Passion Pit is simply incredible. And this album is simply incredible. Buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|love it, needs to have open servers and cooked food needs more hearts, other than that explanation game woke on the up dates

B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are a great duo. Thier songs range from comical to conscious music. It's a great albus because gets to the roots of hip/hop and rap, not lilke the crap that's out there today.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|When it comes to Taylor Swift, you don't have favorite songs (because they're all so good!), you have favorite lyrics. Honestly, it is the strength of Taylor's lyrics that make the songs so good. I mean, the music is good and she sings great, but the lyrics really take it up to the next level. \\"All To Well\\" has got to be my favorite song! Every time I hear it I get goosebumps! haha. I can't wait to see the Red tour!
B006VGGAC4|3.0|I really enjoyed the first part of the book.  I learned a lot about Arnold Schwarznegger that I didn't know before, especially about his childhood and bodybuilding.  However, as the book went on, it seemed like he was just bragging about himself.  I also didn't like how the whole situation involving his child with the housekeeper was just tacked on at the end of the book as an afterthought.  I'm sure if the scandal never came out to the public, it wouldn't have been in the book at all.
B007THA4FI|5.0|This book was great.  I could not put it down - amazing development of characters keep pulling me along to see what the next connection or cross-over event would be and how it would take place.  I never read Harry Potter but was happy I choose to read this novel.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I had spent many hours on this game and was up to level 45...THEN there was an update and it was reset to the beginning!!  not so sure I want to invest all that time again...???
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|While I somehow didn't realize the bonus features were all on Blu-Ray and am a little disappointed that that is the case, I am pretty satisfied with the purchase of this product as it arrived relatively quickly after I ordered it and it was in great condition.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Finally, after twenty years, KISS comes back with their best album since \\"Revenge\\". Nearly every song rocks. The only exception is the Eric Singer sung \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll\\". It could have easily been left off the album. Other than that, it truly is a \\"Monster\\" of an album.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|On A Personal level, this film hits all check lists. The fact that a Batman film is set in New York City, just a year after I did a personal art project highlighting the city is amazing. The movie itself is stunning, and super-fast paced. Seeing it 10 times in theatres was not enough for me, I need to own this in splendid Blu ray, with MASTER AUDIO - which is now becoming standard for Blu rays. MASTER AUDIO is like, a cold ginger ale on a hot day.<br /><br />Back to the film. The story is unusually awesome, and it takes Gotham City to hell and sets it on to a brighter future. The \\"plot holes\\" and \\"film length\\" are a product of movies that will never be fixed. People want more, and they somehow need everything explained, but that is not the case with this movie, for good reason. I'm all over the place with this review, so I'll settle it down.<br /><br />This is a great Batman movie, with many explosions, flying vehicles, fist fights, hot girls, and more explosions. Also, Batman gets his ass kicked, and comes back for more.<br /><br />The only downfall - it does eventually end, so owning this on Blu ray will satisfy that need.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|once I tryed to play this game and when I opened it a blank page poped up then it Quentin back to the main worsen I never got to play the game

B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book isn't absolutely horrible, or great. I just wanted to see what the hype was all about. If you've seen porn or read other erotic books, you probably won't be impressed. I was a little annoyed with the amount of Oh my's, impassives, flushes and blushes. That made it a little lame. There are plenty of other words to express what the characters are feeling, believe me. All in all I would recommend the book to get a few ideas to spice up your relationship. Some things I already knew about but just needed some reminding ;-)
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is a great movie, with great acting. It is also a great story. I can see why it won so many awards.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Have played this everyday since downloading. I am hooked on it, time just passes by. Keep saying last game, and 3 games later still playing. No problems with it at all.
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|Enjoyed this because it had humor and some scares.  Overall enjoyable movie.  The actors seemed to have a good time with it and it helped that it was filmed near my home
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I was not expecting a continuation of the 70's 'Soap' that I loved as a young teenager.  I was expecting that Barnabas was freed from his long sleep into the current decade and entered a world foreign to him - and how he dealt with it all.  I was not disappointed one bit.  Not one dull moment in this film. I thoroughly enjoyed the 70's scene and lingo and how Barnabas interacted with it.  Johnny Depp is the coolest vampire yet!
B004LWZW24|4.0|This movie was scarier than I expected.....the best part was no gore. I am weary of the slasher/gore movies which rely on startles and lots of blood.  At one point the hairs on the back of my neck literally stood up and chills ran down my spine.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It was an interesting read, but I had trouble relating to such a lost soul. Somewhere she missed the lesson that happiness derives from love shared with others and getting outside oneself to recognize the needs of others. She's certainly not the only person to experience great loss. Few of us get through life unscathed. Self-destruction is not the best of coping skills, especially when it causes such pain to others. I particularly was unnerved at her lack of regret, even when she found a measure of healing. I would just call it self indulgent.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|We got this game for our dads 54th birthday, He is loving it. Lego sets are always a reliable product, the large box was filled with separate bags and 2 detailed instruction booklets. We were impressed with the design of the model.

B005XDHNF4|5.0|We bought this for our Wedding cake, the assemble yourself aspect was wonderful, the bride had 3 different hair colors (blonde, brown, black) and 3 flower colors (red, white, pink).  I opted to make the Lego bride's veil out of my veil material, although tulle is included.<br /><br />Looked Great!

B006LSZECO|5.0|I feel violated and misled by every character in this book. It is going in my re-read pile! Flynn is an author that has hit my radar, I will most definitely be checking out her other novels.
B004LROUNG|5.0|John Grishman writes books that play-out in his own backyard. Not specifically where he lives, but in his profession as an active attorney.  Grisham's tales are fictional in genre, but real as reflected in life, pretty much the same way television's Law and Order works.  One can find the case from which it was born by reviewing headlines.  I love the book and anything Grisham writes.<br /><br />Dr. Ronald Gordon
B0081BU42O|4.0|Having read all of Banks' books over the years this is by far his best in some time. The Culture and all it's quirks are brought back in full force. Character development is strong, and the the book concludes in a very satisfying way. Long live hard science fiction and space opera!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Absolutely enthralling. I'm hesitant to see the movie because of how incredible the book is. The protagonist is such a complex character I don't know how she could possibly be captured on film.
B006LSZECO|1.0|It was a really good story with all kinds of twists.  The language was awful.  I think you could have written this story and left out all the \\"F\\" words and have a much more appealing book for everyone - even her son - to read.  I won't purchase another of her books.
0393343405|1.0|I kept turning the pages hoping I would find something besides conjecture and supposition. In an attempt to find something nice to comment about the book I must say it was pleasant it was printed using a large typeface.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The Casual Vacancy is a compelling read once you get into it. It is a grim story about self-serving and struggling characters -- no doubt real and not at all flattering. While I was hooked, I couldn't wait to finish reading it and get on to something else. It is raw in places but that's how life is. Good character development woven into an interesting story -- the conniving and maneuvering to fill a vacancy on a town council and the struggles of individuals to survive amid the mess of low level politics and strained-to-the-limit relationships. It is a story about life being hard enough with people and circumstance making it worse. If you think your life is bad or screwed-up, read The Casual Vacancy. You'll feel better about yourself and your life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was mesmerized with the ins and outs of this mystery. I thoughtI had it figured out only to have another twist throw me off
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Better look than default android calculator, primarily because commas make large numbers much easier to read. Only drawback is the advertising bar detracts from appearance.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|A fine Blue Ray presentation.  It may not be loaded with great songs, but the dance numbers are terrific.  It is worth viewing to see Carol Burnette mug her way through a hilarious role.
B009NPKTN6|5.0|It had a good story line, it was funny and Tom Cruise rocked doing his own singing.  I loved the movie and Tom Cruise

B00973902K|5.0|My daughter loves this song. It was worth the money. This is a upbeat clean song even for the younger generation.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|I think it's a fun little game to have. I do wish you could play all the songs though...I have just about zero piano experience and I still love it. You don't really have to be an expert for this. I suppose a little piano knowledge would help, but it's not a necessity.

0783229526|3.0|This film depicts an out-of-control drug-induced orgy of destruction and idiocy. That doesn't mean the film is bad, it is just that it is about 150 minutes of chaos that is almost exhausting to observe and virtually impossible to comprehend fully. The film left me with the question: Why would two educated adult men embark upon a drug eating disaster in which their safety is constantly in jeopardy? There are probably many reasons but primarily, the change of human consciousness is positively reinforcing, that the distortion of perception is highly entertaining, and that the bending and melting of reality is a statement of rebellion against the system but also against the futility of trying to live a good productive life in a world of hypocrisy and idiots. The film shows men taking drugs that distort all perception, which they find extremely entertaining, far more than television. This distortion makes them feel good in the wildest, dangerous, hedonistic manner. They lose their humanity. The film actually starts with a quotation from Dr. Samuel Johnson to the effect that men become beasts to escape the pain of being human. This was more than a witty opening to the film, it is actually the meaning of the entire production. The film could be taken at many levels but many folks will be highly entertained by the outlandish foolishness that these drug intoxicated fellows create around them. It is entertaining and I found it kept me absorbed, shaking my head in disbelief, for over 2 hours. But underneath the foolishness, what was being said?  I think it was saying that human existence is not a bed of roses for we are confronted with death, loss, illness, violence, boredom, and a host of other barriers and burdens. We also are fully aware of these pains, for the most part. Yet we have an escape, the escape of changes to our consciousness that makes it all go away and get replaced by another reality and this wild reality is in place until we come back down to our senses and land back into the world of the living. So was this really a film about existentialism?  Only if you are an existentialist. For most of the world it was about 2 wacky guys acting outrageous while out of their minds from drug use.
0738711500|5.0|Excellent purchase! Have really enjoyed the information and the presentation. Capricorns abhor the waste of unnecessary verbage, but it seems that twenty, or more, words are required! Albeit unnecessarily!! Go figure!
B008K7WCJM|2.0|Gira is very right that this is \\"the culmination of every previous Swans album as well as any other music [he's] ever made, been involved in, or imagined\\".<br /><br />But to label it as SWANS is a bit misleading then.  I've listened to the album a handful of times, and this does not resonate at all with me--a fan who has been listening to their core albums, from FILTH to THE GREAT ANNIHILATOR, almost daily since 1991.  While old fans like me will keep hoping for another SWANS album full of brutally charged tribal musical instinct, cynically elegant lyric-driven content, poetic intelligence, the swirly gothic ambiance of an Beatles/Joy Division hybrid waltzing from an industrial welding shop to the sketchy jazz cabaret across the street, and maybe even some driving dance beats...this is hardly that representation.  Like the previous 'ROPE' album, this 'new' direction for SWANS is too much of a new direction (i.e., they're becoming a \\"jam band\\") for me to hang on to the tailgate.<br /><br />Some songs offered some meandering hints of--and portional resemblances to--the old sound (\\"Lunacy\\", \\"Avatar\\", \\"A Piece of the Sky\\"), but certainly not the offering of lyrical brilliance and sly wit.<br /><br />In fact, this is mostly an unintelligent, overly repetitive, \\"progressive\\" (ahem) drone-chant album a la Angels of Light cloaked in faux fur were-dog insanity that seems quite foreign to SWANS.  Am I entirely against drone?  No, but for a similar yet more satisfying variety of experience, I suggest Loop's [[ASIN:B001ERDYDI Wolf Flow (The John Peel Sessions 1987-90) Double Lp]], Neurosis' [[ASIN:B00005M1D2 Sun That Never Sets]], or Godflesh's [[ASIN:B00000584W Songs of Love & Hate]].  Am I against prog? No, but for a more intellectually honest experience, try Sleepytime Gorilla Museum ([[ASIN:B00138F62K Grand Opening And Closing]]).  And if it's genuine dark-flavored insanity you want, try Virgin Prunes's [[ASIN:B0002YCUSE If I Die I Die]] or Jarboe's [[ASIN:B000R02E5C Anhedoniac]] (her \\"break-up\\" response to M. Gira).<br /><br />Lastly, there are actually TWO bright spots on this album. One really redeeming point is \\"The Daughter Brings The Water\\", which is absolutely brilliant both poetically and aesthetically and completely breaks out of the aforementioned mold to summon the spirit of Ennio Morricone and past SWAN gems like \\"No Cure For The Lonely\\" (see: [[ASIN:B000009PJT Love of Life]]).  \\"Song for a Warrior\\" could have joined it, if only **Hope Sandoval** had sung it with Gira instead of Karen O! [Note: if it's twisted Gothic Country you desire, you can't go wrong with [[ASIN:B0014BF5QS Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots]]...one of the best albums ever.  True backwoods insanity that will satisfy better than the end portion of \\"The Seer\\" on this album].<br /><br />The second is \\"93 Ave. B Blues\\".  This bounds straight from back out of the No Wave interchange of Sonic Youth and Swans when they were playing the underground of New York together (ref: \\"[[ASIN:B007UWCGWQ The World Looks Red]]\\" written by Gira).  What a satisfying throwback to Filth, which I'd love to hear more of from a band that fits the name and reputation of \\"SWANS\\".<br /><br />Gira, please give us back a pure and potent SWANS.  All-encompassing is just creatively dilute.<br /><br />(My sincere hope is that this review wasn't helpful to any of you).
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The characters are well developed. A true release of the imagination into a future that interlinks quite ironically as a metaphor of todays society.The slow build up to the action sequence in every book in the trilogy, while predictable in written pattern, always has a well developed little twist. Well done!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|very addictive..... having way too much fun. spending much too much of my break time playing this game. wish there were more ways to get silver coins for the mini game though.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|Couldn't live without it. It does everything I need it to,  simply, easily. I furnished a new home almost entirely from Amazon - and that, entirely from my phone while I was juggling kids, dogs, movers, utilities, repairmen and contractors.

B004TSXUWY|5.0|A truly inspiring and edgy thriller. Beautifully written. Thoroughly enjoyed with a brilliant twist at the end of the book.
034580404X|3.0|i only read this trilogy because every girl at my work was talking about it.  i was never interested in reading it because it is not my style. but i had to see what everyone was talking about, and i ended up not caring about it that much. but at least i know what the gossip was about now.
B007BDK3SS|4.0|This game still needs a little polish but it is a fun way to blow 5 or 10 minutes. The physics are a little off but it doesn't matter as it is completely unrealistic.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|Linkin Park has written numerous number one singles in their previous albums, but the album Minutes to Midnight, made in 2007, offers a new approach from their original nu-metal, alternative rock sound to something deeper and a much quieter feel. Although it has some heavier rock songs, such as \\"Bleed It Out\\" and \\"Given Up\\" that resembles their past albums, there is a distinct difference about the Minutes to Midnight that has a different taste than what the band has done before. The record marks a turning point for the band, from their original hyper, energetic music to a more calm, mellow sound. Even their heavier rock songs don't quite add up to what they've done before, and it's definitely a mature sound they are evolving to. There are two seemingly separate sections of Minutes to Midnight: heavy rap-rock and quiet, mellowed-down ballads. They have attempted and have succeeded their explorations to a different musical direction.<br /> As their previous albums with the nu-metal sound that contributed to what their main fanbase was used to, Minutes to Midnight has strayed from their initial style of music into a post-modern rock genre. Their unique rap-rock sound isn't completely apparent in this album, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. The album flows well and has a variety of instruments which their past albums didn't offer. Most of their songs have a more mellow touch to them, such as \\"Shadow of the Day,\\" \\"Hands Held High,\\" and \\"Leave Out All the Rest,\\" and doesn't have that hardcore feel that past listeners would be used to. These songs appeal more to the deep, emotional listeners who feel for the songs that have a connection with them. The album does offer songs to keep die-hard fans satisfied, but overall it wouldn't be enough for the listeners to have those songs on their playlist. In Minutes to Midnight, Linkin Park could have added more originality because the album has a kind of stale sound. They have the potential to create something greater but most of the tracks sound too similar to each other and sometimes the album sounds like one long song. The album could easily just go with one sound alike in the genre but Linkin Park's goal was to create something new and listening to the album would define the band's drift to a contemporary tone. Aside from that, the album does offer a mixture of heavy riffs and anthem-like playing leaves them in the listener's head.<br />This album has an overall mix between positive and negative reviews because of their experimental process in attempting to create something new, but their \\"failure\\" to create a stable sound. The album did not live up to most of the fans' expectations, but their new sound sets a tone that shows their growth as a band. It wouldn't be normal for a group to play the same music for the rest of their lives because music changes and so does their lifestyle. Groups who adjust to that change, however, accept the ongoing lifestyle. It's easy for them to have the same sound over and over again, and sometimes it is fine, but other groups want to challenge themselves to grow or change, which is what Linkin Park has done with this record. Linkin Park's change in direction also brings their music to a broader audience while still keeping some of the fans from before.<br />Although the band has sold over ten million copies on Minutes to Midnight, it isn't nearly as successful as the fan-favorite Hybrid Theory released in 2000. Linkin Park's change in music is mainly the reason why the album is not as popular as their past albums. Their change in music was affected by their new producer Rick Rubin, not Don Gilmore who previously worked with<br />them on their last two albums. Many people, however, enjoyed the album because it was refreshingly different from their older work, which consisted mostly of rap-rock and heavy guitar riffs. The fans did not enjoy the Minutes to Midnight as much because they were used to the band's earlier sound. Even their plain black and white album cover reflects on the band's change in musical direction. While listening through the album, there's a mixed feeling that pulls the audience in two directions. The record seems to have a muddle since they haven't strayed too far from before, but hanging onto their old sound can be confusing for listeners. Having less than half the record consist of rap-rock and transitioning to a ballad-style sound pulls the listeners on both sides of the rope. Although they haven't stretched their sound horizon to a whole new level, it's a step in the right direction that doesn't stray too far away from what the fans are used to. Their hip-hop influence that contributed to their past nu-metal sound has disappeared, but in place has turned to an ambient rock band, which is still in the same style of music. Their music eventually leads to a techno-fusion rock that is completely different from Minutes to Midnight and its predecessors, based on their future work A Thousand Suns and Living Things.<br />Two years after their creation of Meteora in 2003, the band went on a two-year hiatus. Since then, they had matured in their sound and attempted to work more experimentally with new elements that weren't used before. As opposed to Linkin Park's past albums, Minutes to Midnight uses an array of instruments that surprisingly blends quite well with their new approach, such as the use of the string section and a church organ.  \\"Shadow of the Day\\" presents a much more dramatic tone that singer Chester Bennington has done than his previous work. Since maturing their sound, rapper Mike Shinoda has less of an importance that the band by abandoning most of his rapping, which the band was notable for in their previous work, but<br />substitutes his rapping by playing part of the variety; he sings in the harmonies and plays guitar as well. Even DJ Hahn has lessened his scratching on the turntables into programming and electronic beats.<br /> Contrastingly, their sound on the album seems to be emotionless, yet emotional. The songs in the album don't seem to be much different from each other musically, but within those songs have deep, meaningful lyrics that address life and world problems, like war. One of their tracks \\"Hands Held High\\" uses meaningful lyrics that identify the problem of the Iraq war:<br />For a leader so nervous in an obvious way<br />Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay<br />And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day<br />both scared and angry like \\"what did he say?\\"  (\\"Hands Held High,\\" 2:15 Linkin Park 2007)<br />The band's use of real-world political situations in their music really tells the long-time fans how they are growing from their previous sound. The record has potential for the band to start anew.<br />The album has a resemblance to other bands, like Radiohead's Kid A and U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind; they have a mellow and alternative rock sound that unifies the band as a whole in which they work together. Linkin Park has creatively distinguished their turning point in their music history from their album Minutes to Midnight, although it has received mostly mixed reviews. Overall, the album doesn't have much of a lasting value but it's good in the sense where the listener can think deeply on it, as if it were a book that leaves the reader hanging. The band loosened up their tight-hard style and material from before to release an ambient record.
B0000549B0|5.0|Harvey is a wonderful movie that transcends generations. Jimmy Stewart makes everything he is in that much better. I recommend this movie highly.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have not read books of this nature in a long while. I also have NEVER stayed up reading until early morning. Christian seemed evil but after reading I realized he was just in need of a gentle spirit like Ms Steele's to help him be normal. The eroticism in the book I thought was not the main focus in the book.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love reading Cornwell's Scarpetta series. I love her style of writing. She is the only author whose book I will buy on its release date and read till I am done. Nothing interferes with this. Sadly though, it will likely be another year before another installment in the series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I loved how he brought two of his previous characters into this one book even though they are basically the same character.  Smart, wise cracking and intuitive.  I love the John Corey books!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A story that held my attention from the first page to the end. A fascinating insight into the world of our SEALS and what they are prepared to do for their country and the world.<br />  The \\"leak\\" of sensitive informatio by persons high in our government are<br />a disservice to our people in uniform and places them in a very dangerous situation for the future.<br /><br />A must read for all history buffs.<br /><br />Found this book on Amazon Kindle
B0095R64AO|5.0|Really enjoyed this film, very real but good.  Been a siegel fan for a long time, and enjoyed the female lead as well.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This was mindless fun, but I got bored with it. There isn't anything new, just added pipes. The puzzles are easy to solve once you understand the logic.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Fun game with very nice graphics.  Two thumbs up for it.  You have to think a little to figure things out, which I personally like.
1451683405|5.0|At first I was only going to give this book 4 stars because I was disappointed in its length even though I knew its length when I bought it.  However, after reflecting on it I think its brevity is a positive.  I love reading clear and rigorous thinking and I just wanted more.  However, Harris makes his case in a powerful way in few words.  This is a really good book.  You have to think when you read this book and you have to think deeply or you will miss the point.  Whether you agree or not you have to give the man credit.  This is a good introduction to free will that might actually cause some to change their minds.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005LAIH5O|4.0|Wrath of the Titans was a much better picture than the original, Clash of the Titans. The plot was a lot more interesting and the acting way better. I would give this a 3 out of 4.
B009ZQC4HW|5.0|Benny, the vampire that Dean escaped Purgatory with finally re-enters the story after being introduced in the first episode. Benny is on the track of vengeance and is hunting his maker when he takes on too many other vampires in a fight. He calls Dean for aid and assistance and as Dean is both loyal to Benny and things are still tense between Sam and Dean, he goes to Benny's assistance giving Sam the minimum of explanation.<br /><br />What follows is a story of cunning, revenge, love and loss with very little redemption - and it is an excellent story indeed. I am so impressed with the new season of Supernatural. I read recently that the creators are hoping to tell their story over ten seasons and if the show continues at this new level of quality I will be watching with renewed passion. Supernatural is a real winner this season. Catch up on all the episodes.<br /><br />A final note, the actor who plays Benny plays him with a laconic, creepy, sexual appeal and it really adds to the interest of the character. Again, Supernatural has improved this season in leaps and bounds.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Since I don't subscribe to Showtime and read and heard from my sis in Aussie about this,I decided to give it a try. I tried renting it from the local video store but some of the episodes were missing. I also checked it at few stores and it was sold out. So when I saw it on Amazon I did not hesitate. It is a very addictive show , wonderful cast and very compelling story line.I can't wait to see the season two.

B00136NW4G|5.0|When the late 80s came around, Ozzy went along with it; perhaps not as much compared to Poison and Slaughter to name a few. But he had the musicianship to follow him, with Zakk Wylde at guitar, Bob Daisley at bass, the late Randy Castillo at drums (RIP) and Randy Sinclair at the Keyboards.<br /><br />Not only the music falls in the metal category, it goes to different places. Crazy Babies, which was a hit at that time, did have the guitar crunch, but had that Pop Rock feel. Miracle Man, also a hit, had Ozzy taking a swing at televangelism (along with the video), particularly against Jimmy Swaggart who was going through some trouble at the time. Don't forget the third hit, Breakin' All the Rules.<br /><br />The album included a dark hymn with Fire in the Sky, including an intense guitar solo by Mr. Wylde. And a more soft tone of the bonus track Hero which is a fantastic ending for an album.
B009ZQ92DG|4.0|After setting up the backstory and all of the relationships, Arrow is settling into its apparent pattern which will be a combination of servicing its longer arcs and detailing Arrow's attempts to save the city through a crime or adventure of the week. In this episode, an innocent man, tangentially connected to the names on the Arrow's naughty list from his father, is about to be executed for a crime he didn't commit. The Arrow goes after the miscreants with mixed success and a twist at the end that leaves the viewer panting for the next episode.<br /><br />The Arrow is good and solid, but has yet to achieve the level of great at least for this viewer. I am hard put to put my finger on just where the lack is, but something both subtle and essential seems to be missing. The actors are all solid enough and the darkly spun comic book hero on his quest for justice is tried and true but the whole thing is like eating rice that hasn't got quite enough salt. Don't get me wrong, the arrow is solid, just not yet great. I will be watching to see if the show survives its growing pains.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Mr De Mille delivered another winner!  If you enjoy the John Corey stories this one is a must read.  If you haven't read any what are you waiting for?  Start with Plum Island.  This book was 600 and some pages and too short!

B0096PAA6E|5.0|People are expecting an album of blues songs that all sound the same. This album has taken alot of shallow music fans by surprize. A masterpiece from front to back. like flipping through a radio and stopping on the good songs no matter what style they are : GC has done it. the 4:38 mark of \\"when my train comes in\\" could be the greatest guitar solo of the last 20 years. Open your mind and enjoy this for what it is : amazing music and talent

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I was actually looking forward to an update, but ever since the game updated a couple of days ago, it freezes or crashes every time I try to play. In its current state, I wouldn't recommend this game at all.
030759565X|5.0|Delicious! I have already made the Eggplant Three Cheese Calzone.  So so good.  I even used the homemade ricotta from her blog to put into the filling.  As Deb mentions, putting in a little extra effort really makes a difference.  I would have to admit I was a tad disappointed when I flipped through the cookbook and saw repeat recipes that have appeared on her blog.  Also the layout could have been better.  Meaning, the recipe list (with the amounts and measurements) is on a different page than the instructions which is a little frustrating when cooking, having to flip back and forth.  However, with those two miscues aside I love smitten kitchen and the blog is what got my interest in cooking.  Knowing the recipes are reliable and outstandingly delicious, is what makes this cookbook worth it.
B00968THRE|5.0|Worth every penny. Ellie goulding did an amazing job. Worth but the deluxe edition. The songs Halcyon and Atlantis are my favorite songs from the album. Really well done:)
0307474259|5.0|I have read this book at least 3 times if not 4. If you have health problems or weight problems, and who doesn't, you have got to hear what this author says. It will shock your socks off. Then you will either throw it away in disgust or it will change your life. When he says that what you eat is what is making you sick, he is right. The American diet as prescribed by our government over the last 50 years has created the health crisis that we are \\"enjoying\\" right now. I was shocked at the degree of gullibility of the medical community and the general public in accepting the hogwash that is the food pyramid. The food pyramid is the same diet they feed to cattle at the feedlots to get them ready for slaughter. HELLO! It is doing the same to us.<br />I can attest to the fact that when you eat a diet that is better suited to the human physiology, that is a protein and fat based diet, you will move toward a leaner healthier state. I have lost over 100 pounds and am still loosing. I am not hungry. I am so healthy I don't know when I have a cold except for a sneeze or two. This has been over a period of 3 years.<br />So back to this book. It is a well written treatment of the history of the present recommended diet. It is scary. I went to Weight Watchers when I was 12 years old before the current \\"point type system.\\"  At that time you ate a set amount of meat and veggies and fruit, 3 breads(teenager program), 3 servings of milk and no fat. I was hungry all the time. I lost weight, yes, but as soon as I could eat again, I gained it all back and then some. Let the yo-yo begin. I have been on all the diets and lost, but I was hungry all the time. Gary Taubes' book has helped me see why.<br />I would urge everyone to take their health into their own hands. Do your own research. See what makes sense. As a very wise doctor said, \\"Dr. Atkins had it right.\\" If you try this way of life, you will find your health will improve. Slowly, maybe, but remember how long you have been feeding it junk.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Started the 30 Day Shred with two of my friends... we only did the shred twice a week.  Every once in a while we'd throw in a fast-paced long walk at the park.  At \\"our pace\\" I went from a flabby out of shape 8 (yes you can be an out of shape size 8!) to a SUPER toned size 4. Couldn't be happier with the results. I BELIEVE IT saying it's a 30 DAY SHRED... About to take the challenge again, as getting married and baby time has brought back some weight. SO THANKFUL FOR JILLIAN's 30 Day SHRED!!!!!! :)

B008IYSMLY|5.0|Love shows like this.  Prefer crime thrillers over reality tv shows any day. Very unique show from other prime time tv..

0316228532|1.0|If you are a true JK Rowling fan, do not buy this book. It is so saturated with too much sexual information that even as an avid romance reader, I was cringing. This is such a disappointment that I actually ended up returning it before even finishing. The plot is ok, but the sexual details don't classify it as adult to me, just unnecessarily crude.

B0053O89U6|5.0|The best comedy that's out there today after archer. Ever since friends got over I've been finding it very difficult to find a single comedy series that could hold my interest. Arrested development did that till they canned the series. Then came scrubs..but once that got over....well archer and modern family saved the day.  So if you though arrested development and scrubs were funny then this one is a definite YES
B009CPJHY4|3.0|We've watched the actors in this cast for many years and enjoy watching what ever project they choose to do. It's a good little movie but it's lacking something that would make it great. I'm not sure exactly what it's lacking but at the end we felt the movie was unfinished. We were expecting a comic movie but felt a sense of sadness at the end. I would recommend this movie based on the quality of the cast if nothing else.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Wow can't believe this movie comes out from Indonesia. A very well made movie and a complete action flick. I think the director was European or something. Sorry don't remember. But a great action movie
B007SGM084|5.0|What did I think of this trilogy?  To quote Ana \\"Hmmm\\". :) This was the most intriguing, exasperating yet satisfying literary experience I have had in a long while.  Once you pick it up, you cannot put it down.  E.L. James takes you through the gamut of emotion with this series. To consider the trilogy as a point, \\"Fair point, well made,\\" Mrs. James. Laters.
B007USWD0U|4.0|I presumed this was an animated movie! Didn't read the review properly. Got suckered in by the cover, but having said that I am glad I picked it up. Was a bit expensive..was waiting for the price to drop but two months later realized it wouldn't so picked it up. The director has done a fantastic job and the style he uses is really unique. Trust me,  you won't be disappointed in this one do give it a look.
B007K8ILUQ|3.0|FEAR AND DESIRE (1953)<br />A little-known, rarely seen, low budget, Military Adventure film.<br />Short, crudely edited, and with a crew of only 15 people, Fear and Desire is Stanley Kubrick getting to grips with his style. He later tried to prevent it from being screened, since he had little love for his debut.<br />Fear and Desire is not extraordinary. Only a true Kubrick fan would love it.<br /><br />It's Kubrick, warming up for his greatness to come.<br /><br />P.S. I hope you enjoyed this short review, and read my other Kubrick reviews. Thanks!

If you've thought about reading this book - what are you waiting for??
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I found the first part of the novel in Montana very compelling.  The narrator is unusual and his unformed and often naive sense as a 15 year old is contrasted well with the comments of 65 year old self (the real narrator).  His parents are rendered vividly and the theme of acceptance is established convincingly.<br /><br />The later parts of the novel in Canada are less successful IMO.  The Arthur Remlinger character remains mysterious--he's sort of blocked and empty and does not, I suppose, accept responsibilty, but I never understood his violent tendencies or how his politics relates to other themes.  This part of the novel goes on too long.  The ending of the novel is moving but feels kind of anti-climactic.<br /><br />There is too much repetition in the prose so the novel ends up feeling baggy rather than tight.  Needed a stern editor.  But Ford's prose is fine and his psychological insight is  often penetrating.  I did feel sucked into a world and memories of some scenes are very vividly etched in my brain.  There are some real bravura passages that you might savor.<br /><br />Fans of Ford will not want to miss it.  Others should try it and see if it floats their boats.<br /><br />--Albert Rouzie

B009ESIGHI|3.0|The missing song in question is a very important part of scrooge's character.  It's what ties him to actually being human, not a monster.  It's what makes him real and gives the viewer time to relate and feel compassion for him.  I purchased this movie when it first came to DVD, and will not purchase it again until it is Blu-ray, original format and with the song added.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Raven's Shadow Book One follows the early career of Vaelin, the estranged son of the Battle Lord for King Janus, a manipulative ruler who will do anything to keep the newly unified four Northern States under his rule. At the beginning of the novel Vaelin is delivered to the Aspect of the Sixth Order for military training as a defender of the Faith, in service to the Realm and King. As Vaelin's training progresses he gets entangled in the web of power struggles between nobility and the Crown and religious struggles between the Faith and the heretic \\"Deniers\\". The cast of well developed characters follow an equally intriguing story line.

B0067QPVJ6|4.0|When I saw the John Carpenter 'Thing' in the theater as a kid, I was blown away. It sent my date into hiding with her head turned into my shoulder for most of the film.<br />  I had always wondered if someone would produce a sequel so we could know Mac's ultimate fate. Wisely, this was never done ( although Dark Horse comics did produce a series of books as a follow up but I didn't keep up with them ). Hollywood will produce superior sequels, on occasion but, for the most part, they eff it up.<br /><br />  As a prequel, this movie didn't work for me, at first. I saw it as too derivative. I let it go for awhile. I had occasion to watch it again, recently, and found my initial reaction a little too judgmental. There's room for legitimate comparison. However, I thought about the concept paired with the location similarities and decided, 'why would there not be a fair amount of deja-vu-ness'?<br />  The finished product can stand on its' own, I feel.<br />  My only real criticism would be with the film makers vision of the alien craft interior. The mesh of a good mech representation on the exterior vs. the claustrophobic, organic interior was a good idea, just didn't work for me somehow.<br />  But, that's it. Otherwise, upon viewing it for a second time, I really enjoyed this prequel.

1612183956|4.0|First book I read by Crouch.  I enjoyed the premise, didn;t hate the end as much as some reviewers did.  A page turner that did keep me up till two in the morning to finish.  But... I did have two problems.  Towards the end, as our hero is running, running, running, it does bog down.  Quite a bit for a book that's supposed to keep the tension level high.  It's like fifteen pages, or the Kindle equivalent of, quicksand, and I skipped quite a bit.  The other thing was, to try and disturb the reader, Crouch has his town people act in quite a bizarre way towards the middle of the book.  I don't want to spoil anything, so all I say is, it doesn't fit.  I think he did it for the shock value.  He tries to explain it away at the end of the book, but it is a very weak explanation and it just doesn't work, and it kind of bothers me that Amazon, who I believe published this, didn't make him give a better explanation for this out of place behavior.  All of that aside, though, I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone who likes a quick, relatively mindless read.

1250010489|5.0|I just finished Trojan Horse this morning and absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Zero Day was very compelling and hard to put down and Trojan Horse keeps on par with its predecessor. One of the best things about these books; they're not overly technical. I've already recommended Zero Day as well as Trojan Horse to a few friends who are not computer professionals. I'm waiting to hear the reviews but when I gave the synopsis to one friend, he ordered it that night.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|And it hasn't changed! I have enjoyed how her music has evolved over the years and this album is a very refreshing collection of holiday songs. Not only does it have the traditional warm and fuzzy bits, it's got covers of Joni Mitchell and Dolly Parton! Kinda heartbreaking but nevertheless beautiful!

If I had to compare it to anyone else, I'd say its similar to the music by Munson & Sons-mellow, somewhat Celtic-style. If I could, I'd give this cd 10 thumbs up-its well worth the $$$!

0399157565|4.0|All three women were unlikely candidates for abduction and murder.<br />The first was Mildred Lott, the socialite wife of a billionaire acquitted of her murder after a clever stunt by the defense. A tall, strong woman whose husband says would rather be shot on the spot than comply with her attacker, she is snatched from her home late one night. Those who knew her found Mildred condescending and overbearing.<br />Following the tragic deaths of her husband and young family, Peggy Stanton had withdrawn into the confined private space of her own grieving, venturing out only to perform acts of charity.<br />The third victim, Dr Emma Schubert, was digging for dinosaur bones in Canada when she disappeared. Colleagues described her as driven, indefatigable and passionate. Over 2,000 miles away in Boston, the Chief Medical Examiner, Dr Kay Scarpetta, had received a video of the palaeontologist's severed ear.<br />Peggy Stanton's mummified body turns up in Massachusetts Bay, strung between a boat fender bobbing on the surface and a weighted cage.<br />A giant Leatherback Turtle had become entangled with the body and was pulling it along, his huge head barely out of the water as news crews hovered overhead to capture macabre footage of the body's retrieval.<br />The killer had tethered Peggy Stanton in such a way he expected her to be pulled apart during her recovery from the bay. But he hadn't counted on the genius of Scarpetta.<br />On the same day, the body of the missing palaeontologist turns up in a shallow grave near her campsite in Alberta.<br />The FBI Profiler, Wesley Benton, who is married to Dr Scarpetta, believes the killings are about power, degradation and destruction. The victims are standing in for someone this clever, cruel, cunning killer hates--a mature, powerful woman.<br />For followers of the series, Cornwell develops the character of Lucy, Scarpetta's brilliant niece; a maverick who pilots her own helicopter and marches to her own beat sexually and professionally.  Lucy is the original kick-ass girl with the dragon tattoo.<br />The Bone Bed is also about Scarpetta's lead investigator, the butch and boozy Pete Marino, who has been compromised by the killer using a hacked Twitter account.<br />Scarpetta herself is having fantasies about a colleague while a beautiful but brittle fellow FBI agent is stalking her husband.<br />Patsy Cornwell is the original CSI writer and over 20 Scarpetta novels has portrayed increasingly detailed forensic techniques, sometimes at the expense of the pace of the story. The reader needs to either digest the material or skip loads of scientific detail like, \\"I pour in the LCV, a cationic triarymethane dye, and mix with a metallic stirrer.\\"<br />Highly recommendedssionally.

B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Five Stars<br /><br />I was happy with Stephen‘s decision to wait for the right time to write this book.  I never wanted to read about JFK's assassination in any prior book because it was too painful the first time. I loved the story of George and Sadie truly reminiscent of my time growing up and mirrored my own thoughts about \\"what if\\" in a much more personal sense of heartache and loss of my innocent times in the 60's.Even so I learned, like George did, that we cannot change the past even if we wanted to and as \\"life does turn on a dime“ fate is seldom understood until time puts it into perspective.
B00913DPW2|4.0|Great price, great game, cool graphics and sound.  The game has depth, it's spooky, the price is right.  This is an all around good buy - would most definitely consider it one of my best purchases relative to apps. Recommended highly for fans of horror or puzzles.

B000929AJQ|1.0|I still remember the last months of my junior year in high school (April-May 2005) and I know \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" was being played like crazy on the radio.  Even though this was a time when I had no interest or knowledge of the industrial genre, I was still turned off by how bad that song was.  Looking at this album now, I have to laugh like mad at the title \\"With Teeth.\\"  The title is supposed to imply that this is something gritty and harsh, while this is really as harsh as a baby teacup chihuahua named Tinkerbell.<br /><br />PHONY DARKNESS<br /><br />Since I've already made my disgust for Trent Reznor pretty clear in my review for \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" I'll save you all the bile and focus on the album.<br /><br />Just like NIN's supposed magnum opus \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" this album is loaded with phony darkness and aggression.  Even worse, compared to \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" this perfectly shows that Trent Reznor is getting old rather than growing up.  He was in his late thirties when \\"With Teeth\\" came out and he's still singing about teenage anger and angst.  Reznor sinks even lower compared to his past efforts now that he's \\"tamed\\" his sound (not that it was extreme to begin with, because it wasn't) that makes this seem like a disco album with some distortion rather than the industrial pop he was cranking out in the 90's.  At the same time, in an odd way, I feel a little less cheated since Reznor is now showing his true alternative rock/pop colors instead of dressing up the music as the darkest the industrial genre has to offer (which is precisely what he did for \\"The Downward Spiral\\").<br /><br />MUSICIANSHIP<br /><br />Again, the musicianship on this album is atrocious.  Yes, Reznor knows how to make a pop melody that's infectious to mainstream music listeners, but this doesn't mean that his music is any good.  Reznor further waters down his already watered down formula for industrial rock by cutting back on this distorted instruments and amping up the \\"accessibility\\" in his vocals that are more well-suited for an alternative rock band (yuck) than an industrial one.  He's watered down the \\"darkness\\" and \\"grittiness\\" in his music so much, that he might as well be watering down water.  The instrument work on this album is terribly weak as well.  So much of the guitars, keyboards, bass, and drums all form \\"by the numbers\\" songs you'd hear in so many of the mainstream bands of the time...with the occasional industrial elements, of course.<br /><br />SONGS<br /><br />The songs on this album are either painfully boring or trying-too-hard to be noisy and dark.<br /><br />An example of the former is \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same.\\"  No joke, this song sounds like a ballad from your run-of-the-mill, MTV-approved alternative rock band.  \\"You Know What You Are\\" is an example of the latter and much like many of the \\"masterpieces\\" off \\"The Downward Spiral,\\" it's just another \\"loud\\" alternative hard rock song with the occasional industrial elements to it.<br /><br />\\"With Teeth\\" isn't a good song by any stretch, but I did think the bass in that song was kinda catchy and cool-sounding, but that's all the praise I got for that one, as it just feels like an angst-laden b-side from Audioslave's early recording sessions.  \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" is the \\"hit\\" off this album, and what a pretentious, lame song it is.  It's loaded with hammy poetry and I was gritting my teeth when I heard those horrible lyrics (\\"What do you believe/When you bite the hand that feeds/When you chew until it bleeds\\").  \\"Getting Smaller\\" is another track on here that's supposed to be \\"noisy,\\" but it's really not.  It honestly sounds like a hard rock \\"party anthem\\" with an \\"angry\\" aesthetic to it.  \\"Sunspots\\" sounds like a bad alternative ballad with an electronically-manipulated scream behind it.  \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is another example of Trent Reznor wanting to have his cake and eat it, too.  It starts off with an industrial beat and while it maintains it,it quickly descends into bad alt-rock territory.  I can keep going but I think you all get the picture.<br /><br />PRODUCTION<br /><br />Supposedly, Reznor wanted to stay away from making the album sound \\"digital,\\" and resorted to using more analogue instruments and recording equipment.  Analogue or not, this album, like all other phony \\"dark and gritty\\" albums, has perfectly clean production and sound quality.  Again, it's things like this that show Reznor is really a pop musician at heart putting up an image of being \\"dark.\\"<br /><br />FINAL WORD<br /><br />Skip this album and get your paws on the Front Line Assembly demo collection called \\"Complete Total Terror.\\"  Despite only being demos recorded with minimal resources in 1986-87, the tracks on this collection show a true love for dark, unsettling music unadulterated by pop melodies and urges for mass appeal.<br /><br />Let \\"With Teeth\\" collect dust on the store shelves, along with anything else in the music section that has NIN or Marilyn Manson stamped on it.it quickly descends into bad alt-rock territory.

B0084IG7KC|5.0|Every avid reader will tell you that no movie is ever as a good as a book, but this one was awfully close.  It is an enjoyable movie with a subtle social commentary I think most young viewers might not even pick up on.  The story of a young woman forced by her government to participate in a fight to the death with 23 other teenagers at a publicly televised arena for all of the nation to see.  It has drama and action, an unlikely love story in the midst of the chaos and death. Who will prevail...who will get the girl?  You are truly missing out if you haven't seen this movie yet.

0316228532|5.0|Just finished reading Casual Vacancy and I loved it.  It reminds me of Charles Dickens or Jonathan Franzen type novels about human nature and behavior.  This book is also very humorous and had me almost laughing out loud- some of the plot twists are that funny.  Yes, the book has its tragic moments- vivid scenes of poverty, violence, drug addiction- but all very realistic portrayals that are essential to the plot development.  This is sort of an expose on arrogant behavior, elitism, sexism, insensitivity- and its effect on the children and disadvantaged that are targets of these abuses.  This is a book that is serious in its intentions and execution.  I highly suggest reading it if you are a serious fan of fiction and literature.  Gotta say I was surprised how readable and riveting this novel was for me- now on to Back To Blood by Wolfe.
B008FTAAG2|4.0|First album of in this moment but seems pretty good. Hope they stay true to their style with upcoming albums. Look forward to the future!
0618526412|1.0|Don't believe Amazon when they say you can have overnight shipping.  MY daughter could not find a book for school, so I ordered it from Amazon.com.  I paid more for shipping two copies of the book, so I could read it too, than I did on the two books.  We are at 1 week past the day I ordered the books and they still have not shown up.  My daughter has since driven 25 miles away to another bookstore, purchased the book and finished it.  Two days I ago, I put in a request to stop the shipping and was told it was too late.  This is ridiculous!

B005EGXTL2|3.0|This is really well written, but unbelievable. NO one kills kids. Paedophiles are destroyed in jail. Also people are starving? Not even via overpopulation, just because? On this fertile planet?<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like about it was the graphic violence. Why? I mean, is this really a kids series? Because it certainly gave me nightmares. This book is supposed to be for YA. Really? What is it about the world today where kids are recommended to read explicit violence, but not a swear word or the naked body? Sex and swear words no - detailed violence that makes you want to throw up for 12 year olds? Sure!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have not looked forward to a story's furtherance in many many years. I am in my 40's and female.  I doubt I fit your demographics.  ;-) I would like to tell all of you that when you read a book a day, as I have done for most of my life,<br />it is seldom a tiny story slips into my attention.  I never stop looking for originality & an excellence of writing that is sadly lacking in the world today. There is no genre I don't read. As a rule I dislike intensely anything written in stages purposefully, however I could see that was unintentional here. It is my fondest wish that you return to this story, and write as much as you can for a very long & enjoyable feast of reading. Please do not follow the path of fellow writers and bend to what \\"they\\" think your fan's want. Listen to The Fans, don't give us bit's and pieces of stories. (trilogies)(The nightmare of the future!!) if you must release material in this manner?  PLEASE, for the sanity of those who like to burrow into a book for a long, long time. Make them offer a boxed set at the end. We who love excellence in writing will happily pay the price of it. I forget more books than I remember, they are not worth remembering.  This story has been stuck in my head for ages, I'm actively stalking any further issuance. I feel the tale is not done. The reason it's so well loved is it's humanity, you brought these people to life in our imaginations & kept the story intriguing. Please remember this as you write anything, and we will follow you anywhere. The second your publishers stick you in a small categorized slot? True readers will go look for the originality you had. Don't let them do it to you. Wishing you every success in the future.  Legacy 1st Shift (Prequel) was Equally Good. Please come back to Wool with a novel's worth of more reading for your fans!!  ;-) This is by FAR your Best work.

I felt that the book was not up to Ken Follett's usual standards.  I was turned off by his obvious bias against Republicans in the World War 2 era. I felt the book was hurriedly written in order to score political points before this year's election.

1401235166|3.0|Reason for Reading: Next in the series.<br /><br />The main story being told in this issue is the titular story in which an heir to the North Wind must be found.  This becomes the beginning of a new story arc that will carry over now in which the cubs will feature more as main characters.  Throughout this story there are also various sideline stories as well: one of major note follows Bufkin in the new land of Oz carrying over from last volume and is proving interesting.  Also of smaller note both Rose Red and Miss Sprat have their own storyline as well.  This arc leads us to many new beginnings (since much was wrapped up last volume).  Not a lot really happens though, not much excitement or reveals but storywise things are being set up for the new story arcs.  After this main portion of the book we are treated to two smaller stories.  The first is a Christmas issue which takes Rose Red out in search of finding Hope in a cross of Dickens' A Christmas Carol and The Cricket on the Hearth.  Finally, the end section is a series of small vignettes which tell tales from \\"In those days\\" back to the times before or during the rule of the Adversary.  Most of these have nothing to do with the overall story arc, but they do tell interesting little tidbits of background information and there are a couple which hint at what is in store for a couple of characters further down the line.  Overall a passable issue, but nothing really happens, except for finding the heir to North Wind, as this is otherwise a set-up issue for the new paths the story will be taking.
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|The movie arrived quickly and was new. it was in great condition and i love the series. thank you so much for this awesome series
1906735875|4.0|Reason for Reading: I've read quite a few Judge Dredd collections now including book 5 of these Case Files and knew it was time to start at the beginning.<br /><br />This is where it all started!  The very first Judge Dredd stories collected together in chronological order are a delight for any fan to read.  I had such a fun time reading this book.  The book starts off with single episode stories but it doesn't take long until the Robot Wars issues start and we have a long running sequential story.  After this the stories vary from one short episode to several long running issues.  Midway through the book Dredd is sent to Lunar-1, the moon, as the new Marshall, and the rest of the book takes place there which was a little disappointing as such little time was spent in MegaCity 1 for this book.  However just at the very end he returns home to earth.  I had not ever read any stories that took place on the moon so this was all interesting for me and I have to say I enjoyed everything in this collection along with all the cheesiness involved in the early days of Dredd.<br /><br />First, I had not realized Dredd started in the late '70s, I had thought it was early '80s, and this makes a difference in how the comic was presented.  My first shock right on page one was being presented with a skinny Dredd!  This skinny '70s Dredd is surrounded by other skinny people with Afros and Charlie's Angels' haircuts.  It takes the whole book for Dredd to develop into a muscular Terminator-type though not quite up to his '80s self yet.  Also MegaCity 1 is in the US and Judge Dredd though a British comic is very American in presentation, however as we start to read the first couple of comics I was hit by the \\"Britishisms\\".  Right away way the word \\"lorry\\", then came \\"petrol\\", \\"lift\\", etc. this continues for quite some time and starts to disappear midway through the book, though even at the end the word \\"lift\\" was used.  In the collections I've read so far I haven't gone back this early, and have paid particular note to how \\"American\\" the MegaCity culture is so this was surprising.  Another difference was the lack of Block names, instead of the amusing famous people names for the city Blocks MegaCity is just divided into numerical Sectors, Sector 64, etc.  It will be interesting to see when the Block names are incorporated.  Finally, a major difference in the early Dredd is his personality.  Dredd, of course, always gets his man and is on the side of justice no matter what, but this early Dredd is a bit of a goody two-shoes compared to the mid-80s onwards Dredd.  Every crook is captured and goes to prison.  Dredd drives around handing out fines to citizens for jaywalking and driving too slowly.  He main concern in life is following the law to the letter.  He's really a bit of a jerk when it comes down to it, not the complex character he is now, and I wouldn't love him if this was my first exposure to him.  But it's not and I do.<br /><br />I could go on about \\"this\\" Dredd and the later Dredd but when all is said and done this was a load of fun for a fan.  I would not recommend a newcomer start here; you probably wouldn't \\"get\\" what the big deal is, a lot has changed.  But these stories are fun, yes some are cheesy, but some are very good.  I loved seeing how Walter was introduced, the first glimpse of Judge Rico, the whole Robot Wars episode, the \\"red shirt\\" syndrome of any other Judge who went out on a call with Dredd, the introduction of Judge Giant and the introduction of Sov-City.  Looking forward to volume 2 which promises to bring the epic \\"Cursed Earth\\"!, and have paid particular note to how \\"American\\" the MegaCity culture is so this was surprising.  Another difference was the lack of Block names, instead of the amusing famous people names for the city Blocks MegaCity is just divided into numerical Sectors, Sector 64, etc.  It will be interesting to see when the Block names are incorporated.  Finally, a major difference in the early Dredd is his personality.

But it's not and I do.<br /><br />I could go on about \\"this\\" Dredd and the later Dredd but when all is said and done this was a load of fun for a fan.  I would not recommend a newcomer start here; you probably wouldn't \\"get\\" what the big deal is, a lot has changed.  But these stories are fun, yes some are cheesy, but some are very good.  I loved seeing how Walter was introduced, the first glimpse of Judge Rico, the whole Robot Wars episode, the \\"red shirt\\" syndrome of any other Judge who went out on a call with Dredd, the introduction of Judge Giant and the introduction of Sov-City.  Looking forward to volume 2 which promises to bring the epic \\"Cursed Earth\\"!
B0015DROBO|5.0|I had the book on my kindle. But I could not finish reading it. My kindle quit working on me for about 4 month, so I needed to buy the book, so I could finish reading it. After I was done, I bought the other 2 books. Now my kindle is working again and I deleted the book.
B0098460O4|5.0|I give this CD 5 stars not just for the beautiful voices but also for Jonathan's Loyalty. I was moved by his BGT performance and was upset with Simon for putting them down; however, Simon was right. She is good but Jonathan is amazing. Don't get me wrong, she is very good but they have different styles. Some people may like the combination of voices. She can also go solo, as she is also very talented or they can stay together, as long as they keep singing we will all be blessed with such amazing talent.<br /><br />The CD is very, very good, excellent, but Jonathan needs to be on his own. His voice was toned down. Jonathan is God's gift to his generation. He should not be robbed of his talent. Jonathan's voice is just so powerful; it will be hard to get him a comparable female voice; probably Joanna Marie, if I remember her name right, from one of his high schools videos in YouTube. I do like Charlotte. She is an excellent singer and has an excellent voice. It's just that singing next to Jonathan, Charlotte's talent is eclipsed as he is a Megastar with a Mega-voice. His voice is like a Supernova. Jonathan is the \\"Tenor of the Century\\".<br /><br />I am glad that Jonathan and Charlotte were able to do this CD as the world will now know about them.  We must remember that they are only 17 years old. The whole World is waiting for them, together or solo. He has just such an amazing voice that he can stand on his own and make an auditorium shake. In their BGT audition, when he sung, you could feel the power in his voice like he was bringing down the place and the whole ceiling was going to collapse. I have to admit that it brought tears to my eyes and every time that I see it, I still get that amazing feeling. Yes, that's how magnificent he is. She is good too. She can go on to Broadway or do musical theater and Jonathan can do opera. His voice moves me and that is something that does not happen to me as I'm not sentimental or emotional.  Jonathan can sing very difficult pieces and makes it look so easy, like we could also do it. He does not even break a sweat.<br /><br />The most wonderful thing is that Jonathan does not have only an amazing voice, but he also has a beautiful soul and stood by his friend, and it's not the other way around like most people think. I hope that he has built up his confidence to go onto the World stage alone. He has such an amazing voice, so much power, the tone, even when he sings the slow mellow parts. I love everything about his voice. I'm buying more CDs for my friends and I hope that one day he has a CD alone and best of all a World tour.  I bought two CDs and I already gave them away to my best friends as I had to share it. I copy it to my phone while I get more copies. I should have ordered more.<br /><br />Excellent CD, love it, love Jonathan and I love Charlotte too; and I love Jonathan's loyalty. The song selection is excellent. The Caruso rendition and the Ave Maria are superb.  Their version of Forse is better than the original. I hope someday Jonathan signs opera in some major World stage. I can't say enough, I love the CD, I love Charlotte and I love Jonathan. Did I mentioned that I Love Jonathan. I read some reviews saying something about the orchestra drowning his voice. I don't really care; I want to hear Jonathan with or without an orchestra. You don't have to agree with me. I highly recommend the CD, unless you want to keep listening to them in YouTube.<br /><br />I bought from Amazon for many years and have never left a review, that's how impress I am with Jonathan and Charlotte.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler is one of the few artists I know of that gets better with time. He consistently produces exceptional albums and this keeps the trend going.<br /><br />This album has the same feel as his last few... maybe a little stronger on the Blues style. Some fun, rollicking numbers blended with some real heart-squeezers. The Drowned Submariner song on disc 2 is such beautiful sorrow, it often brings a tear to my eye.<br /><br />What an exceptional songwriter and musician!<br /><br />I'm so glad this is a double CD... lots of songs to keep me going until the next album :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It was not what I expected, it was actually much better. I think it ended up being a prequel to alien serious but overall I really love this movie and I hope to see more
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think this app is fantastic. In fact, I like how it slowly wakes you up that I've completely switched off of my alarm clock and just used this. It has easy to set times, slowly wakes you, and makes you jump through mathematical hoops if you want to hit snooze, making this one of the better apps in my arsenal.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a book club selection and I was not enthusiastic about reading it.  I have to say I was very surprised how much I enjoyed it!  It was one of those books that stays with you.  Someone in my life will say or do something and it will remind me of something in this book.  I recommend this book to both young adults and adults.  Tough subject but great perspective.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|THANKS TO THIS GAME I CAN NOT PUT MY KINDLE DOWN IT'S SOOOOO ADDICTIVE!!! I NEED MORE COINS PLEASE!!!!!! LOVE IT
B000B5OD4I|3.0|On the positive side, I like the looks of the watch.  On the other hand, there are 2 major drawbacks in my opinion: 1) the jubilee bracelet and clasp feel very cheap and flimsy (note: I usually wear oyster bracelets) 2) the screw down crown is not very smooth.<br /><br />I haven't had it long enough to gauge accuracy.  I am keeping the watch, but almost returned due to the bracelet.  Fortunately, there are numerous options for a replacement.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love playing this game. you can buy stuff if you choose to but you don't have to. it is a really good free app! the graphics are amazing!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a total time waster and you don't really get anywhere. But for some crazy reason I just keep plunking in those coins.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it I couldn't put it down. It kept you captivated from beginning right to the end. A must read book.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Not a horrible movie but was ok. The story line was a bit too light and full of holes for me and the ending wasn't satisfying for me, either.
0751517089|5.0|I'm amazed by the inefficiency of Baring's at the time !<br />It's tremendously well written, just mind - blowing story.<br />thanks for all that Nick.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have been reading through Percy's journey from the beginning and grown to love his character and Annabeth. Have read the first two in this series and Rick Riordan has not disappointed me yet. Both series have been one that I have been able to share an interest with other adults who love the journey as well.
030759565X|5.0|Deb makes everything easy.  She has tested these recipes so many times that they are completely foolproof.  Everything I have made from her book or her blog comes out perfectly and wildly impresses every one I serve it to.  In addition, Deb is such a captivating writer that you cannot help to hang onto every word.  Move over Julia Child and Martha Stewart, there is a new MUST HAVE cookbook in town.
B0086700CM|5.0|where do I begin I love this app. a friend had it and I started playing it and I loved it. when I got my kindle fire temple run was the first thing I downloaded.I highly recommend this app to everyone.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Time to uninstall i suppose so yeah i guess they just want the iphone one to only get updates a a a a
0786715103|5.0|It is a fine book.  The subject is so extreme I can hardly take it.  EVERYBODY needs to be aware of Genocides - and work to insure that it never happens again!!!!!
B00979CS50|4.0|It iscan excellent album with the Horse sound. The extended jams and the social commentary, from Driftin' back to Walk Like A Giant, are relevant and captivating.  But I still think Ragged Glory is their best, and this recording cannot hold a candle to that excellent recording, so it set Young on such a path through to date with the Horse.
B008EK91XU|1.0|The Kindle is MORE expensive than the hard back.<br />Why would I do that?  I would like to read this book, but something is wrong with this situation.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is not that bad and is similar to Temple Run in many ways. Those who've played it will find limited enjoyment here as it's tedious and repetitive.<br /><br />My reason for the high rating is because I see potential.<br /><br />For starters, there are a lot of characters but what if the player were able to make one of their own? Not only that but the level is repetitive. What if there were different areas, such as a subway station in New York, a highway or just a busy city street? Last but not least, there really needs to be more powerups...<br /><br />On a side note, if the game is uninstalled but reinstalled, it would be nice to retain your progress, especially if money way spent in game.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing a new and improved game.
B004EF2XC0|5.0|This is the best drama I have seen over the last few years.<br />Don't usually go for love stories, but the drama and realism<br />made this a can't put it down till the end movie.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After the comments I heard about it, I expected something else. I find this book poorly written, and the story not attractive and credible enough. I don't think I'll keep reading the following books...
B0069UP2PI|3.0|Contagion is a decent movie, but not a great one. The plot of the movie is simple:  A mysterious new infectious disease breaks out, it spreads rapidly across the world, and altruistic medical scientists labor to bring it under control.  The idea for this film was reportedly inspired by the 2003 SARS outbreak. This is not virgin territory.  This same theme was the basis for the 1995 movie, Outbreak, starring Dustin Hoffman and Rene Russo, and it was covered even better in Richard Preston's best-selling book, The Hot Zone.<br /><br />Contagion does benefit from a stable of A-list actors and director, Steven Soderbergh.  Befitting a big-budget, Hollywood film, the cinematography, international film sets (Hong Kong, London, Geneva), and technical production aspects of the film are excellent.  The plot is fast-paced, but it harbors no surprises and is predictable.<br /><br />The actors give good performances, but the characters are one-dimensional and almost stereotypical.  Matt Damon, as a harried father, scrambles about, frenetically protecting his daughter from the virus, after the death of his cheating wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) and son.  Playing a character that doesn't quite fit into the plot, Jude Law portrays a sleazy blogger that attacks the Centers for Disease Control, while secretly profiting from a homeopathic, Forsythia extract cure.  Laurence Fishburne plays the role of a heart-of-gold CDC researcher that is more of a caricature than a character.  First, he is threatened with disciplinary action for warning his fiancée to leave Chicago, one of the disease epicenters.  (This warning presumably precipitates an immediate mass exodus from Chicago.)  Then he gives his dose of the precious nasal vaccine to the janitor's son, rather than immunize himself.  This is the stuff of sainthood.  The actors do a god job with the material they are given, but there was little opportunity for nuance or complexity in their characters.<br /><br />In short, the movie is well-acted, well-crafted, technically competent, and scientifically accurate.  But it has a thin plot and shallow, one-dimensional characters.  Contagion can provide an evening's entertainment, but it will leave no lasting memories.
0525425578|4.0|This story is definitely designed for adolescents and is a very good story for that age bracket. For adults it may be a little simplistic, but for adolescents John Grisham has provided a challenge with several built in challenges, as well. For instance, should he call his parents when he decides to leave town in pursuit of the victim's presumed location? That's a major dilemma for a 13 year old. Too many things could go wrong. John Grisham teaches the adolescent reader why parents make rules and how to both respect those rules even when it appears they should be bypassed and how to achieve the higher goal, in this case rescuing the person abducted. Kids have a tough time with decisions that flaunt independence rather than obedience, and Mr. Grisham shows respect for both the responsible parents and the responsible adolescent who may sometimes bend the rules but won't do things that harm anyone, including himself. Good book, great author.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I  am addicted to Dexter!!!!!!  Arrived  on time and safely. As always it kept me glued to my chair. All I need is popcorn!
B001EC2ISA|1.0|*update*<br />Amazon revised the rating to PG. When I purchased this, it was showing a rating of G. (there is a G version out there on VHS. Trust me. We owned it.) My original review was based on the fact that Amazon had this showing as &#34;G&#34;. It was not. There was a G version out there, when this was on VHS. I assumed this was the same version based on the G rating they provided in the info. They have since updated the listing to reflect that it is NOT the G version.<br /><br />Warning to those parents thinking of introducing a G-rated version of this movie to your kids: this is NOT the movie you're looking for!<br />While Amazon clearly states this as G rated on the regular and HD versions of the download, it is NOT. (I am not talking about the actual DVD, I'm talking about the INSTANT VIDEO option)<br /><br />Much to my dismay, I found myself scrambling for the remote when a scene popped up with vulgar language! (F bomb, anyone?)<br /><br />Not cool. So, to warn parents hoping for the elusive &#34;G-rated&#34; version for your kids? Um, this is not it!<br /><br />As an adult, with appropriate ratings disclosed, it's great.
B0012PDVQ2|5.0|I needed to see this movie for a film class I am attending. I literally can't believe I have never seen this movie. Blade Runner is an amazing movie. Remember it was released in 1982 so the view of the future is different but that's part of the beauty in the story. The last 15 minutes will change your life. Maybe not literally but possibly yes. Watch this movie, it's worth your time.
B000NU2CY4|5.0|Best Russel Crow movie ever. This is a movie of historic perportion. It is one of the best Ancient history movies. Filmed well, lot's of action and adventure.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|In this day and age and with all his cinematic experience he produced a real sleeper It's no wonder this movie is hardly known.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|Excilent movie. I, served in Vietnam, 1968 and 69. But htis is about in the beginning of the Conflick, this was the beginning of the big buildup, Very realistic, grafic, very well made film. The relation ship of the characters at war and the home folks brought me to tears. You will feel the pain of the people involved.
0451232852|4.0|Although a little bit long it was an enjoyable escape as well as being informative. Opened my eyes to times I can only imagine.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|Excelent, story, action and landscapeing senes. I, would recomend this to anyone who likes action and adventure. I, got it on Blu Ray, it is far better than the DVD. Of course m0st Blu Ray items are far more visuwal.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I had bought the blue ray version only. But when I say this deal I bought it again. It is definitely worth the purchase.

B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I use this in my college comp. class. It is a great alternative to a paper dictionary!; it is also very very helpful at work.

B005IQZB14|4.0|Good book.  I really felt for the author and wished her luck the whole way.  Wish I was strong enough to take on a challenge like that on my own.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|This is one of the worst movies I've paid to see and I while I hardly review films I wanted to share my disgust with this so others save their $4 to rent.<br /><br />Why was it so bad? I already saw this movie, it was called \\"Alien\\". I then saw Aliens, Aliens II, III, and then Predators and Aliens I-IX, etc, so on and so forth.<br /><br />Did we really need another Alien origin story? And was it really an origin story for Alien or Human or both? You see, that's the main problem I had with this film. Scott had clearly dropped a ton of references to Alien throughout the film but the storyline had no clear path and tried to do too much as it hopped around for what seemed like 3 hours and then boom there's an alien.<br /><br />The entire story made little sense and there wasn't any real draw for why a couple of scientist spelunkers would travel to a particular star system looking for big dudes (titans, woah Prometheus made us!).<br /><br />Exploring the stars is great, but why does it matter where you're going? Do you really need a cave drawing to convince you to go somewhere and why do you need Guy Pearce to get there? Apparently so as Pearce's character is the vehicle, literally and figuratively, for how they get to the other planet. His character was useless though and due to editing it was rendered meaningless.<br /><br />Ridley used the idea of rich guy looking for immortality as the rational for him spending $1trillion to go across the universe, umm, what? Ahem, if I had $1trillion and I could freeze myself indefinitely and had a android son I would probably just tell him to wake my ass up only when there was a cure or some way to just download me into Data from Star Trek. In other words, don't wake me up when you find giant aliens that kill people, oops!<br /><br />Michael Fassbender really mucked things up for Guy but he was probably the most interesting character in the movie and yet he was pretty clichéd and was turned useless, except I guess to tell the Girlwith the Dragon Tattoo how to get out of the movie, too bad he didn't tell us how to get our money back, zing!<br /><br />On the whole Ridley Scott wasted too much time doing nothing and fails to deliver - there were so many directions this film could have went and there was a ton of time to actually tell a story but instead he drops Alien all over the place. Maybe why it didn't work is because this is two movie ideas mashed into one, perhaps Ridley was looking to make a movie about Prometheus and couldn't help himself, and so he pulled in aliens?<br /><br />Honestly this movie is just boring and every scene where an alien jumps out is expected and something you've all seen before. By the time the climactic moment comes you won't give two shits about any of the characters nor will it be interesting how the titan is defeated and when the movie is \\"over\\" you're not going to be surprised at all when an alien-alien is pooped out.<br /><br />I will just add that in the instant watch rental there was an added bonus with an alternate ending that's slightly better and brings more meaning but it's nowhere near enough, but it made me wonder, did Ridley Scott film more scenes like this, scenes with more dialogue, and the studio cut it up in editing?<br /><br />Finally - if this was a free rental I would probably have given it 3 stars. Sometimes having to pay for something makes us more critical and $4 was a bit too much for this, hoho!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I have been playing this game for a long time and I haven't seen any of the ads for gems. If you don't have anything good to say, then don't say it. Let the people reading these reviews choose for themselves if it is good or bad. If you like it have fun with it, if you don't it was at least free, well except the gems but that isn't the point. You have the right to choose if you want to spend money or not. I prefer not payingand I have a sucessful resturant now.<br /><br />-A happy customer.
B008I3QZKU|2.0|Just as The Killers went 80's retro when they first hit the scene, now they've gone mid-70's Top 40 Pop retro.  If you like Christopher Cross, Al Stewart, Supertramp, and the more ballad-esque Foreigner, then this album belongs in your collection.

0741470314|5.0|If some one were to challenge me to propose a one word description for the work done by Dr. Karen Moriarty, author of \\"Dending A King-His Life and Legacy,\\" I would select the word \\"Redemption.\\"<br /><br />Michael Jackson was one of the most maligned celebrities of all times! He was forced to defending himself in court accused of henious crimes. There was a media frenzy about this and other issues in his life.<br /><br />Dr. Karen Moriarty did the research to proclaim his innocence as well as announce that he was a gentle, decent man, a dedicated father, generous citizen and an outstanding performer. She took on the herculean task of calling attention to her redemptive research in publishing \\"Defending A King-HIs Life and Legacy.\\"<br /><br />One of the many significant facts that remains in my memory is that Michael Jackson contributed more than $300 million to thirty nine identified charities.<br /><br />Redemption indeed!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I rarely purchase music these days.  Between being able to listen on YouTube to exactly what you want to hear, and Pandora that has introduced me to many new artists... I just don't see the need to own the actual songs or CDs anymore.<br /><br />I came across The Piano Guys by accident on YouTube.  That evening I spent the next two hours searching out every one of their songs/videos.  For the next two weeks, I was completely enamored.  Finally I saw a video where they were asking for sponsors because they would love to quit their days jobs.  I paid $35 for the first CD/MP3 download - more than strictly necessary to merely own the music.  This is their second album and it is better than the first.<br /><br />Peponi is an African style re-imagining or Coldplay's Paradise.  The video is awesome, the passion of the singer, the music... the whole package is so well done that my husband will come home, put this song on repeat at max volume (hope the neighbors appreciate it) and hum along for 30 minutes or more to it.  The Cello Song is one by Bach (sorry, can't recall which one) remixed as a song for eight cellos.  Each and every song here is a remix of a song you know well and can hum along to, but done by top notch musicians with great arrangers behind the scenes.  Reminds me of when Beatles tunes were gotten ahold of by Herb Albert and Brazil 66.<br /><br />Steven Sharpe Nelson is the cellist.  He started with guitar lessons as a kid, then switched to drums in his teens, then switched to cello (I may have the order wrong).  Well now, the physical instrument he uses most often is the cello... and he plays it like a guitar and a drum set at the drop of a pin.  (He plays piano, too, and Lord knows what else.)<br /><br />John Schmidt (no verification on whether or not his middle name is Jingleheimer) is the usual pianist.  He is hugely talented and plays with the same passion as Steven.  It is the passion combined with the skill that makes this such a worthwhile listen.
0525953728|5.0|I remember exactly what I was doing on the morning of September 11, 2001. My wife called to wake me up before I was to be at class and mentioned I should turn on the TV. The images that flowed over the screen have been emblazoned on my mind and I will never forget.<br /><br />For the past ten years we followed the hunt for Osama bin Laden and when he was finally killed we celebrated the justice served to one of the greatest terrorists the United States has ever had to face.<br /><br />With OBL's death, the media flooded us with stories of the quick assault that ended his life and as always we questioned their accuracy.<br /><br />When I read a blurb about No Easy Day I immediately put it in my wishlist and waited for its release. I picked it up while wondering Walmart the other night and couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Whoever Mark Owen is, thank you for writing a first had account that neither glorifies or romanticizes what happened.<br /><br />The book is a journey of what it is like to be a Navy Seal that works with Seal Team Six as it is commonly known and gives a behind the scenes look at the training and previous missions of those who were assembled for this all star team. Mark Owen serves as the personal storyteller and I was glad to see that it was handled with care.<br /><br />Many books like this tell stories that seem to be fiction. I never felt that Owen went beyond what actually happened in his descriptions. It was just like every other mission he had been on but they had a higher targeted individual and what he describes differs greatly from the steady stream that we were fed via the mainstream media.<br /><br />I can't remember a book that captured my attention as much as this one did since reading We Were Soldiers Once...and Young: Ia Drang - The Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam.<br /><br />Part of what draws me to these books is reading about a life that I will never live. Again, I know a lot of books glorify serving in the military and the stories that are told are full of romanticized fabrications, but books like these that tell the truth in readable and interesting ways can bring that aspect of life to reality.<br /><br />It always amazes me at how often we take our military for granted. I wouldn't consider myself a pacifist or a warmonger, but somewhere in the middle. I know war is necessary and our military is necessary in ensuring our safety and freedoms. I have lived most of my life near an Air Force Base and have many friends that serve in the military and I am so thankful for their sacrifices.<br /><br />Reading this account of the path that lead to OBL's death was fascinating. While I plan on reading Mark Bowden's account The Finish: The Killing of Osama Bin Laden to get an account of the methods and information that led to finding his whereabouts from an intelligence perspective, I found Owen's book to be a satisfactory account told from a soldier's perspective.<br /><br />It was never boring and I came to care about this guy and several others as they trained and prepared for these dangerous missions. The Navy Seal's are the real deal and this book testifies to that.<br /><br />I must say, the actual assault on bin Laden's compound was pretty boring. I think many will be surprised by the account of the actual event compared to what we heard written about and shown on the major news networks.<br /><br />I won't spoil it for those who want to read and experience the account for themselves. All I can say is that the book is worth the purchase and its one I know I will return to read again.tories that are told are full of romanticized fabrications, but books like these that tell the truth in readable and interesting ways can bring that aspect of life to reality.<br /><br />It always amazes me at how often we take our military for granted.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I was really looking forward to this novel as I have read all of the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them immensely.  This book was really not up to par, and didn't really grab my interest until near the end, and then it was over.  I hope that future books are better!
0385535147|4.0|I found this to be an &#34;OK&#34; read, but not a book I hated to put down.  In fact, there were portions of it where the lack of perceivable progress in the story became so tiresome, I longed for an excuse to close the book.  But then, as if to reward my perseverance, Grisham began to reveal the 'real story',after which I found it much more enjoyable.<br /><br />I would have preferred to rate 'The Racketeer' with 3-1/2 stars.....somewhere between &#34;It's OK&#34; and &#34;I like it&#34;,

1400052181|3.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks<br /><br />A black mother of 5, in 1951, was admitted to John Hopkins' charity hospital, the only hospital that would treat a black person, complaining of a \\"knot in her stomach\\". She had cervical cancer. The doctor's removed some cancer cells from her cervix during a biopsy to be cultured and eventually used in millions of laboratories around the world as one of the only kinds of cells strong enough to survive outside of a human body. The colored woman, who died after intense and drawn out radiation therapy, was never compensated, or even told, that this was happening.<br /><br />\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\", by Rebecca Skloot, is a non-fiction book about the ethics of race and medicine, and how they changed between the 1950s and now; of scientific medical discoveries and faith healing; and of a daughter desperate for answers about her famous mother. Eric Roston writes in the Washington Post, \\" 'Immortal Life' reads like a novel. The prose is unadorned, crisp and transparent. Skloot frequently glides into section and chapter breaks with thought-provoking quotations from interview subjects.\\" Lisa Margonelli writes in the Ney York Times that the book made her \\"hair stand on end\\". The book includes the story of how Rebecca Skloot began a journey to discover the truth behind HeLa cells, and along the way brought an end to a lot of suffering for a family that was ignorant of what exactly had happened to their beloved Henrietta. The book especially explores the ethics of taking cells without consent from patients. Skloot includes many pictures of the Lacks family, as well as photos of other important figures in the story.<br /><br />Skloot's purpose in writing this book was to bring to light exactly how the HeLa cells (named for Henrietta Lacks) came to be, and to reveal the troubles that afflicted the family of the person those cells came from. Skloot writes in her book that it was in an early biology class in college thatSkloot first heard about HeLa cells, human cells that are capable of surviving in a laboratory workspace and are thereby excellent for experimentation. Skloot writes from her own point of view as she talks to family members, doctors, journalists, and social activists who all are involved with the creation of the HeLa cells or with Henrietta as a person. Skloot explains about biology, history of medical science, history of medical ethics, and the life of Henrietta and her family members. The book relies on historical documents and on Skloot's own journalistic work. It's written for everyone, and explains very complex concepts in simple ways that make it easy to understand, is clear and concise, but is dramatic in the way that it tells the story. Skloot jumps around in time, talking about the birth of Henrietta in 1920 in one chapter and her own endeavors to speak with Henrietta's daughter in 2008 in the next. For readers with experience in the biological sciences or medical field, this book should speak directly to the reader, as it covers many of the basic practices involved today in those fields. The book has launched Henrietta and her family into fame, is being made into an HBO movie by Oprah Winfrey and Alan Ball, and is a New York Times Bestseller.<br /><br /> The subject of the book is the HeLa cells, the person who they came from, her family, and ethical and scientific questions that were raised by the discovery of the HeLa cells potential. Skloot's thesis is that at the time that the HeLa cells were harvested, medical ethics, especially as they related to the race of individuals, were much worse than they are today, although today they still have a long way to go, and is perhaps best epitomized when she writes, \\"Pneumoencephalography was a technique developed in 1919 for taking images of the brain, which floats in a sea of liquid. That fluid protects the brain from damage, but makes it very difficult to X-ray, since images taken through fluid are cloudy. Pneumoencephalography involved drilling holes into the skulls of research subjects, draining the fluid surrounding their brains, and pumping air or helium into the skull in place of the fluid to allow crisp X-rays of the brain through the skull. the side effects--crippling headaches, dizziness, seizures, vomiting--lasted until the body naturally refilled the skull with spinal fluid, which usually took two to three months. Because pneumoencephalography could cause permanent brain damage and paralysis, it was abandoned in the 1970s.<br /><br />\\"There is no evidence that the scientists who did research on patients at Crownsville got consent from either the patients of their parents. Based on the number of patients listed in the pneumoencephalography study and the years it was conducted, Lurz told me later, it most likely involved every epileptic child in the hospital including Elsie. The same is likely true of at least one other study called \\"The Use of Deep Temporal Leads in the Study of Psychomotor Epilepsy,\\" which involved inserting metal probes into patients' brains.\\"<br /><br /> Additionally, Skloot points out that the family of Henrietta was treated poorly throughout their involvement with Henrietta's cells and the outcomes of those cells being harvested, as when she writes the words of Deborah, Henrietta's daughter, \\"\\"She's the most important person in the world and her family living in poverty. If our mother is so important to science, why can't we get health insurance?\\"<br /><br /> Skloot tells the story as a series of events: those of her engaging the family of Henrietta, those of Henrietta's life, those of the scientific and medical community, and those of activists who have made it their lives' missions to support Henrietta and her family. She tells us what happens, sometimes non-chronologically, emphasizing the events of what has taken place, and the decisions and impact of those decisions by all parties involved.<br /><br /> It uncovers many hidden secrets that would have otherwise remained unobserved. It is also very accurate, relying on many historical sources for much of its information. Skloot appears to be objective save for the fact that she develops a personal relationship with the family of Henrietta, especially her daughter. The importance of the subject of the book is debatable, but in my opinion it does present a large part of America's history and the history of medical research in an easy to understand way. It is very thorough; Skloot herself personally researched the subject by herself over the course of several years in order to ensure that the information presented in the books was accurate. An ordinary reader will find the book very useful for learning more about Henrietta or parts of the history of medical ethics.<br /><br /> Skloot does very little arguing as opposed to simply laying out the details of her research before the reader, and never directly states her own opinions. The book explores the ethics of taking cells without consent from patients, discriminating between white and black people, profiteering from production of HeLa cells, experimenting on HeLa cells, and of how medical research is conducted. The book is unique, and its subject hasn't ever been the sole subject of another book.<br /><br /> The book has its detractors. Lariah writes in an Amazon customer review, \\"The book erratically seems to rehash over and over how (ostensibly) Henrietta Lacks was exploited when during (free/charity) surgical treatment of her cancer, the physician took a sample of the tumor tissue (Did she want to keep the tumor tissue for herself? Did she want more of the tumor tissue left on her cervix?)... The physician and researcher did not use HeLa cells to get rich - indeed, while professionally notable, they never profited from HeLa research, and their conduct was standard protocol for the time.\\" Gerry O'Malley writes in a Google book review, \\" By referring to Henrietta somehow being \\"alive\\" is falacious. The cells are not Henrietta - in fact they are the opposite of Henrietta. The cells are anti-Henrietta and are what actually killed her... Frankly, the only part of the book that isn't salacious, pandering, Jerry Springer-level anthropology is the 13 page Afterword, which is actually a well-written and thought-provoking essay. Now Ms. Skloot is forever linked to this pseudo-story, not as an objective observer but as a character in her own fevered imagination. It is a tremendous effort at self-promotion and glory-seeking which throws a dark shadow over the believability of any of the events of the story... The descriptions of injecting the prisoners with cancer cells and the Nazi experiments (Chapter 17) can only remotely, peripherally be construed as having ANYTHING to do with HeLa cells. It's comparing apples to oranges and these conversations have no place in this book... I cannot believe that Dr. Lengauer doesn't speak with an accent, yet the author elected NOT to colloquialize his speech or any of the other non-minority characters. This was probably the single most offensive thing about this book. It is condescending, sanctimonius, patronizing and probably racist.\\"<br /><br /> I personally consider \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" to be an excellent source of information on the life of Henrietta and her family, of the history of medical and scientific ethics. Skloot's account is riveting, at times evoking emotions from the reader through even simple descriptions of the events that changed the lives of the Lacks family. It is an engrossing story for any mature reader.
B004BBDHEK|3.0|The Album was somewhat classic Yanni, but a couple of vocal tracks got thrown into the mix. This made the recordings very \\"pop\\" in nature and detracted from why I purchased this album. I actually fast-forwarded through the second vocal track. This sounded like an attempt to cross genres, but just fell flat. The rest was as expected.

B007HJ84ZK|1.0|It is unfortunate that we have come to demand explicit sexual content to say a show is good.  This and Boradwalk Empire would be so much better without the sex trade 'actors/actresses' involved.<br />Is HBO getting its funding from the porn industry, like STARZ for Spartacus?<br />Sad that we Americans are taking the low moral ground with our television production.  It is especially sad that the entertainment industry gives these folks awards, etc. to hype them up.

The best tracks are The Dude and especially Razzamatazz; I have such a deep appreciation for Patti Austin's vocals at the end. After all this time I still can't sing \\"We can make it better with a little bit of razzamatazz\\" as fast as she can without stumbling!

B00873GRU4|5.0|This book is terrific. It harks back to the golden age of science fiction but with a modern feel. The characters are well drawn and the plot and setting very powerful and moving. I was left touched and very moved by this book. Well worth the price, I wish I had bought the paperback to keep on my shelves instead of the Kindle.
B007TK77QE|4.0|It was a good read, totally different to Harry potter and not a kids book. Bit confusing at the start with the introduction of lots of characters but keep at it, it becomes a lot clearer as you learn how their lives intertwine. Really enjoyed its humor, detailed insights to people's darkest thoughts & feelings. I enjoyed it.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. The author weaves together 1970's and 80's pop culture, video gaming and retro computer technology into a thoroughly modern setting and a plot that rips along at a cracking pace. If you know what Defender, Galaga and a TRS-80 are, you MUST read this book. Enjoy ! I sure did.

B008X8QCTO|4.0|I absolutely loved this game..Alawar has some pretty good adventure games and this one was even better. Its creepy and isn't super easy but there are hints if u need them. The only thing I didn't understand is how they priced it its 99 to begin with then they charge u another 1.99 in the middle of the game to finish..why not just charge 2.99 to begin with? I feel it was worth it though if u like these kinds of games. Definitley a keeper!
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I've listened to this record maybe 40 times, and it just seems to get better and better. At first, many of the lyrics seemed awkward or trite. But as other reviewers have noted, once you get into the groove of Born to Sing, the music really cooks -- and the lyrics work. It's been a long time since Van put out a record without backing vocals -- Veedon Fleece maybe? -- and what a luxury it is to hear his glorious rich voice, the growls and scatting, out there all alone. Listen to the third time the word \\"sing\\" appears in the title track: It has seven syllables. It's almost as if Van is winking to the listener, saying \\"You want singing? I'll turn a one-syllable word into seven. How's that for singing?\\" The musicians are terrific, and I of course include Van here with his breathy alto sax, keyboards, and guitar. \\"If In Money We Trust\\" is a real knockout; it sounds like nothing Van has done, to my ear, since Veedon Fleece. The third chorus of \\"Where's God?\\" explodes, showing again how Van can build a song dynamically, like a little symphony. I love this record and have deducted a star only because it doesn't quite scale the peaks of Van's best work.

B004LWZWGA|1.0|I am not a Batman nerd, but I have seen all the Batman movies and loved Nolan's first 2 of the trilogy, but this was a total mess! So many ridiculous things happened that I lost count. I KNOW it is based on a comic book, but if you are going for modern times believeability, at least try to make sense. There was no comedy at all in this which could have helped some of the huge plot holes. Some of my \\"favorite\\" things were...<br /><br />All the \\"poor\\" people of Gotham just decide to destroy the no crime peace and take down anyone who has any money. Yeah, that's a good idea because somebody with a face mask and a few guns thinks it's a good idea. Maybe they couldn't understand what country his accent was from because it kept moving from country to country.<br /><br />The 3000 cops just rush the automatic weapons and manage to subdue them with fists while Batman and Bane duke it out. Can't one of the cops manage to use a gun and shot him while this is going on? Millions of lives are at stake-wouldn't want to be a hero and do the right thing.<br /><br />And what is with Batman not using a gun? Gee, you think he might WANT to after thousands get killed because he doesn't and millions could die later? Where is the Bat Logic? \\"I'm going to hit you with my fist repeatedly and hope that does the job!!\\"<br /><br />And why does he let \\"Catwoman\\" keep duping him? And why does he waste valuable seconds kissing here while they are mere seconds away from an atomic bomb explosion. Just ridiculous!!! You killed my father so I'm gonna destroy a city and millions of lives.<br /><br />Why is it snowing when it looks like it is 80 degrees outside-so fake!!!<br /><br />And so many more for you to see in the biggest messiest film of the year
B0017SWPXY|1.0|I was hesitant to buy the book after I read that it was in the view of the dog, but there were so many good reviews. This book was not only boring but repetitive and annoying. It kept telling a part of the story that the dog wouldn't have any insight into because he wasn't there, then back stepping and saying he (the dog) could only speculate because he was in fact a dog. The author did that several times. WE GET IT...

B007GCY8FS|1.0|Jack Reacher, Jack Reacher, where are you? Certainly not to be found anywhere in \\"A Wanted Man\\".<br /><br />Lee Child has always been an auto-buy for me, but I couldn't even finish this book. When I realized I was not enjoying the read, but felt as if I were taking a dose of bad-tasting medicine, I quit. Sorry, Lee - I love you, but this was not even close to the quality writing you usually produce.<br /><br />The first inkling of discomfort arose when Reacher, who was a passenger in a car with three strangers who'd picked him up hitch-hiking, was taking his turn driving and the female passenger began silently communicating with him via weird blinking signals. Not Morse code blinks, but some way-out alphabetical left-right first-last stupid confounded, impossible for anyone to comprehend blinks.<br /><br />The female passenger was a single-mother cocktail waitress who'd been abducted when car-jacked by the two male passengers. Wait, no - she was an undercover FBI agent. Huh? Oh, and one of the male passengers was an undercover FBI agent. And no one was doing anything that made any sense or was remotely in the realm of realistic.<br /><br />The confusion and not-plot continue: a sheriff who died of a heart attack. a little girl that was kidnapped, but wait, no, she wasn't - she was reunited with her mother, the non-waitress undercover FBI agent, and they were being held in a fenced enclosure, along with Reacher, another female FBI agent who didn't know anything either, and a missing witness to a murder, and on-and-on nothingness.<br /><br />If you're now confused, you can understand my feeling while trying to read this poor example of a Reacher novel. I tried to finish this novel - I'd read a few painful paragraphs and set it aside. Go back to it another day and tried again. It just wasn't worth it.

I found the child to be so precocious as to be completely annoying and the scenarios too unrealistic (who would let a kid that age roam all over NYC by himself, let alone get in cars with people whom he barely knows?).

Just verbiage and saying in 100 words what would take three by a competent person. Do not wast your money on this junk; I got it free from someone who was sent a review copy but after reading 5 pages, he threw it into a pile of give away barrel in a book store. If you must read the book, read a book on statistics before you begin so you will see the absurdity of the book.
0307588343|5.0|A Colossal jorney: On average- I read 3-4 books a month- I know-- however it is a passion of mine. Biographies; Economics; Leadership; From Lincoln to Richard Branson; \\"The Tao of Pooh\\" to \\"The Art of Power\\"; Hayek and Ferguson: I can state- firmly, A Colossol Failure of Common Sense- has a bit of every part of Maslows Hierarchy stiched into it. From the ambition and dreams of a young man who everyone thought- was not going very far- to self doubt / mastery of inner fears; Self- Actualization - The Power of belief- and of hard work; The bond of friendship- over years: The \\"arrival\\"- the \\"realization\\" and the \\"heartache of loss\\"- and redemption through firm values-- all while winding through a minefield of business timebombs- ethical ; emotional and intellectual.<br />The inside look at how even the mighty- can be felled by lack of common morals, ethics, boundries and sense; The book is also filled with insights into the decision making- both tactically and fundementally- that goes into a major analysis of a portfolio. Perhaps for a MIT or Wharton grad- the book may point out the obvious ( easy to say AFTER the fact, as many of the protagonists WERE from famed business schools and lineages) - however for the 99% who never smell the cold, oxygenated air of a Wall Street Power Centers \\"Bridge\\"- the book is compelling. I finished it in 48 hrs-- and felt bad when I finished - as I looked forward to coming hone and \\"Going to war\\" with Mr.McDonald at Lehman-- I hope another book is forthcoming- lets all just hooe it is not titled \\" Another - Colossol Failure of Common Sense\\".

When a member of the local council dies it has far reaching ramifications for a number of the residents - it's game on for the casual vacancy on the local council...<br />I found this book a real page-turner and a really enjoyable read. After putting aside her Harry Potter-style of books, J K Rowling has successfully written an \\"adult\\" book and peeked inside the lives of a variety of residents of Pagford to uncover the unsavoury and, at times, thought provoking lives of this quiet little town. I would recommend this book.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I just wanted to make sure that anyone reading the bad reviews should take them with a grain of salt. YES, it sucks that they are dragging out the Avatar releases, and not including any special features or the extended version on this. But if you own a 3D system, you HAVE to own this. I'm not even a huge fan of the movie (plot is predictable and cliche), but I'm loving 3D, and this movie is the best of the best. The world of Pandora comes alive with 3D, and I found myself watching this multiple times to fully soak in the amazing visuals. And if someone wants to see what 3D Blu-Ray can offer, this is the first movie I pop in.<br /><br />I also didn't own any of the previous versions, so it was an easy purchase for me. But even if you have a previous version, I would seriously consider getting this...why deprive yourself of the eye candy? Who knows when they will come out with the \\"3D Special Edition\\"...

B008QTV3X0|5.0|We are downloading this to our Tivo - it is working great (my first time to purchase a series as a download). My husband and I both are totally into this series - is he a marine or a spy? Every week we think he's really a good guy, and then he must be a spy. The cast is excellent and I am totally hooked. I recommend to anyone!
B0013F1D02|5.0|A very unique fantastical movie. It was very enjoyable to watch and not like a typical fantasy movie. I even bought the book after seeing the movie.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|This gives a detailed explanation of the routine preparation of a Navy Seal and its application to the killing of Osama Bin Laden. The ultimate telling of the raid was suspenseful and exciting, however the pre-raid day to day account of SEAL activities was much less so.  Although the author disavows political intention, he nevertheless questions  the validity of the role & control assigned our (non battlefield) commander in chief, implies disdain for the news media's response and strongly advocates that all credit for such stealth missions should be give (not to the commander in chief as has been traditional), but to the men who actually carry out the missions. This position seems to be the motivation behind  the author's breach of secrecy contract, a breach that some may consider brave and others disloyal, but nevertheless is a breach that is highly unusual, questionably illegal and quite political. If this is the author's position, it ultimately questions our democratic process and while it is every citizen's right to question thusly, it is appropriate and honorable that the author has removed himself from his duty as a Navy SEAL. I admire and  thank him for all his years of service and can only imagine his sense of burnout. I (we) also thank every man and woman in all the branches of military service who, on a daily basis, risk their lives while serving our country. We non military citizens owe them everything.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love this game. However, lately I have not been able to play for more than one minute before it tells me the application is not responding and won't let me play. Has been going on for two or three days now. Will update my rating if being able to play resumes.

1451662432|4.0|Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story is the autobiography of Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Arnold's story really is amazing.  What are the odds that a poor boy growing up in post WWII Austria would come to America, become the greatest bodybuilder in the world, make millions of dollars in real estate, become one of the most recognizable actors in the world, have his films gross almost $4 billion, marry into American royalty, and become the governor of California?<br /><br />Having followed Arnold's career for 30 years and now having read the book, it's clear that he beat those supposedly insurmountable odds because of four things:<br /><br />1) An optimistic refusal to believe it couldn't be done<br /><br />2) Systematic step-by-step planning<br /><br />3) Hard work<br /><br />4) The support of friends<br /><br />Arnold takes us through his entire life (so far), from the lessons he learned as a child in Graz, Austria to his return to Hollywood, after his terms as Governor.  Arnold is candid, throughout the book.  He takes pride in his successes and mistakes.  Arnold sees each mistake as a lesson that is needed for later success.<br /><br />The bodybuilding career is well detailed, although I'm not sure the readers will come away with an appreciation for how much work it was, because Arnold looks back on it with a nostalgia that makes it seem joyful.  I found it very interesting how valuable the mindset he developed as a bodybuilder was to all his later accomplishments.  As a bodybuilder Arnold knew that to perfect a pose or to build a muscle it took thousands of repetitions of an exercise.  Nothing is accomplished instantaneously or without effort.  Therefore when he became an actor, he thought nothing of practicing dialog or stunt work for hours upon hours.  Although, thirty-five years of seeing hard work turn into achievement turned into a stumbling block when he entered the world of politics, where things aren't as orderly.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that the chapters on his movie career were not as all encompassing as I'd hoped.  It appeared to me that each progressive movie was discussed less than the ones before it.  Some movies are never mentioned.  I understand why - the book has a theme and narrative and talking about some of the movies would not have added anything new to that theme or narrative.  Of most surprise was there being no mention of Christmas in Connecticut - a TV movie that he directed.  I would have been interested in what he learned being on the other side of the camera.<br /><br />The chapter that unfortunately has been of most interest to the press is that chapter dealing with the infidelity that resulted in a child with a household employee.  It's important for the sake of balance that that chapter is in the book - not only for the necessary candor but because it too was a learning experience.<br /><br />Arnold's story is a very motivational story.  He didn't start with any advantage over the rest of us, he's human and makes mistakes like the rest of us, and yet has accomplished so much.  I think you will enjoy reading it and will learn from it.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are Awesome. They have taken and run with a fresh new way of bringing classical instuments, music from yesterday and today, together in an unexpected and exciting way. Their ingenuity within their arrangements and humor are refreshing. Their videos are visually stunning and very entertaining. Piano Guys,,,, Bravo!
B0056BMK6K|3.0|The book has an interesting perspective on how to use social media and blogging to promote your book, but I didn't find it as original as the author seems to think it is. Nothing particularly groundbreaking. I also felt that his advice would work best for very extroverted people, as a lot of it depends on a person's willingness to spend hours \\"making friends\\" with other people on social media in the hopes that they will slowly get \\"upgraded\\" into email friends, and eventually be willing to spread the word whenever a new book comes out.<br /><br />I'm not saying this couldn't work ... it obviously worked very well for him. But I also get the sense that he is a real extrovert who loves making online small talk. I just think most authors wouldn't be geared towards this type of promotion. But then the world is a changing, and one has to change with it, so it could be said that many more traditional options are not very effective either.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate was learning that less is more when it comes to blogging. On that point it was good to get his perspective.
B005LAIHSG|1.0|Disgusting!!! So much violence. Lack of real imagination and lack of tenderness that in fairy tales balances the cruelty of violence. If a young one or even a child sees it before sleeping he will have some nightmares. Perhaps minds are different now. Think that our mothers and fathers used to recite or read to us snow white before sleeping!!!<br /><br />But the actors were very good and the same for the photography.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I liked every one of the characters, and the uplifting theme appealed to me very much.  Judi is one of my favorites as is Bill.

B002RT2BXQ|5.0|The Fountain Head demenstrates the moral strength and integrity that is needed to succeed, and to be persistant in your endeaver. Others who have power (people who rule and have control) will try to destroy you.  It's like all odds are against you. The Fountain Head will show you \\"what it takes\\" and what sometimes happens to the people/person that has lost his/her power. The video reveals just how difficult this can be when the people on top rule.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett has done it again and written another page turner. It was every bit as good as The Fall of Giants if not better. I learned just how important spies were in WWII and just brutal the Russians were. It was interesting to see how the cold war unfolded. Definitely an exciting read.
B008HK3XU4|1.0|Everyone seems to like this case but I must be doing something wrong because my KindleFire HD 7\\" does not seem to fit. how do you get the clips to hold it in? Mine doesn't seem to fit under them also they seem to block the volume button. Did I get the wrong case??? I think I would really like it if I could only get it to fit plus I wish there was someplace to store the stylus.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|In my opinion, Walking Dead is the most entertaining show on television (or amazon in my case).  Great mix of story and action...  Season 3 does promises to be the best so far...

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Couldn't wait to get this DVD.  The movie was awesome.  There was not one minute in it that you can miss.<br /><br />My favorite part?  Near the end when the Hulk confronts Loki in Stark's penthouse.  Small scene but awesome.  And there is a scene following the credits.  Don't miss it.  Funny.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie, you should.  Other awesome action movie of the year:  The Dark Knight Rises.

1451650728|5.0|Much can be said the last couple of years about the way the star trek novels have been reshaping the universe Rodenberry originally created. This series is definitely going to help redefine and reshape that universe, and this Novel is a huge step with that. The only part I am not a fan of is the way of loss of life, but I know that it will play a critical aspect in the future. David Mack does that...a breadcrumb will turn into a rollercoaster. The story, writing and character development is amazing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Perfect for my Kindle Fire, use it everyday! Very easy to use and very easy to navigate as well. Repinning and selecting boards, following other Pinners, awesome!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Read the introduction about the three kinds of silences.  It's poetic in the individual words, yet at the same time extremely tight and pithy in the pacing and structure, almost like Hemingway.  The entire book sustains this intensity, which is hard to believe, until you read it.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|An excellent album with the help of Jeff Lynn playing and co-producing.  Shows how to make pop music interesting.  Joe didn't need to be drunk to make good music!

0525958002|5.0|I have been i fan of Duran Duran for many years and i still am.<br />Reading Johns book really makes me appreciate who is.To read about<br /> everything he has struggled through from family,friends,relationships,fame and addiction but yet he still brought all of us the music we love and still love.<br />He has opened my eyes and touched my heart to see the person he is and not<br />the sexy guy in a poster on my wall long ago.I would recommend this book<br />to anyone if you are Duran Duran fan or not.Excellent job Nigel John Taylor!
B008GAV6YA|5.0|My son loves this book. We are big readers here and he probably has over 100 books, yet he still chooses to have this book read to him @ 5 times each day. It is a basic, good book to introduce the idea of using the potty. True, it does not elaborate on the \\"process\\", however it is a great beginner book to begin the conversation of using the potty.
B008PWUWLC|5.0|My Fire cover has been a beautiful pink embossed cover. However, my husband and I are going on vacation and he will be using it, so I really wanted a \\"not so girly\\" case. The Timbuk2 Gripster Jacket for the Kindle Fire, Grey/Cold Blue is perfect! It is very attractive and clean looking.<br />The Kindle slides in easily and is held very securely, with a velcro closure on the fold edge that tucks under the Kindle.<br />The jacket has rubber grippers on the long open side that allow it to stand open. I feel this is a much better system than my other case, which used slots in the opposite side of the case from the Kindle. Eventually, the case just wore enough to not allow it to stand well.<br />I think there is more than enough padding to protect your Kindle. Buy this jacket with confidence.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This really is a great game.  You can spend money but not needed to ensure you advance.  They are always adding new dragons and content to keepnyouninto the app.  Just try it I'm surenyou'llnlove it.
1476712042|5.0|LOVED this...can't believe the next one isn't out now!  Simply a masterpiece!  It holds your attention to a point in which you are almost afraid to continue in fear of what you will read.  The intensity of their love is amazing.  Could not put this down!!!

030758836X|4.0|I wasn't sure I was going to like this book but once I started it I just couldn't put it down.  And just when you think you know what it going to happen next.....not what you think.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone but I now know why this book has been on the best seller list for so long.  There is a little bit of everything....romance....suspense...thriller..... I feel it is unlike any other book I have read.....just read it and you will know what I am talking about.
B004EPYZPS|4.0|From beginning to end, this movie held me enrapt!  The characters were loveable, adventuresome and bold!  This film was pure SPIELBERG!
B008OOYALE|4.0|this game is fun but it takes patience and real money. a lot of things take gold.  other wise it is fun
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I found this book thru my daily deals and noticed the great reviews so wanted to give it a shot. I am so glad I did! It was a thriller, mystery, drama and a bit of romance all in one. I devoured it.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. London is a very good writer and that shows in this book as with all his other books. (Which I recommend!) A great school read if you are studying the Yukon Gold Rush. I highly recommmend it!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|As a fan of the AMC television series, The Walking Dead, I just had to read the comic to see how much of the story is being adapted from the comic. So far its almost identical, aside from some few tweaks and adjustments here and there. Overall, I love the comic, and will be reading up on the following series.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|only one color, blue. good selection of alarm tones. screen on kindle fire is kinda bright even with color/brightness turned down

B0091REZMW|4.0|...so good. Well, I haven't  been playing this game for very long. However,  I like what I have seen so far. I plan to continue playing. It is definitely worth checking out.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|got this one when it was free for the app of the day.  Now that I've played it, I would definitely purchase it even if it wasn't free
B009O8I34O|5.0|It was good to see Ducky in this new role.  It reminds of the old days when he was a part of the Avengers.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Build it knock it down build again. My son loves this game. He either plays it the way intended or just plays Witt eh birds included. Good price for a toy that can be used multiple ways to entertain a child.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a feeling these characters deserved each other. Not too far fetched at all. Great psychological insight. The author really pieces together this intricate piece very seamlessly. The format used is different yet easy to follow. She did a great job. It's fresh, interesting & completely sick.
B001CTDH76|4.0|I love the time I get to watch the Mentalist. amazon has help me get all four seasons. I just happen to catch an episode on cable that Amanda Rightti was added half way through and Simon Bakerwas only a guest. I didn't see that on my first season. Help find out if I missed alot.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I liked kings storytelling in a suspenseful yet non scary way. I highly recommend, the plot and characters make you want to read on and on.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I kind of suspected the twist at the ending but I felt like the author handled it really well and it held true to the characters as they had been crafted.  I really enjoyed this second installment and look forward to the next.  Highly recommend for those who read the first book in the series.
B008OOYALE|5.0|got my husband involved in it to we compare notes on the game we love that we can visit others as well as our own
B005K01VZS|5.0|REally enjoyed this book.  A fast read with lots of food for thought. Love the writings of Mitch Albom!  This is one I'll read again.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great 3d affects answered a lot of questions. Added a couple new questions will we have to wait another 30 years for those.
B009B2U73I|5.0|A different approach than her past albums. Excellent musicianship, as always, but with a different feel. Krall's version of Fred Fisher's \\"There Ain't No Sweet Man . . .\\" has a spooky feel and is a lot of fun. \\"Prairie Lullaby\\" somehow merges a western feel with light jazz. The lullaby has a genuine feel to it; you can easily imagine her singing it to her children. Two songs (\\"There Ain't No Sweet Man\\" and \\"Glad Rag Doll\\") have brief reprises towards the end of the album. A great album and highly recommended.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Catching fire A great conclusion to the trilogy. Could not put it down  had to keep picking it up and reading more<br />Can't wait to see the movie  a really good read buy it now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. The author  writes so vividly, you feel as if you know these people.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Great way to spend some time. Reminds me a lot of the arcade games when I was a kid. I wish there was less of a time between coin regeneration, but other than that it is a fun game.
B003K15INU|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  I found it to be interesting and well written. It has an interesting mix of fiction and actual history.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed the book, but was disappointed with the very end.  The book had a great pace and the characters were interesting.  The plot twists were great, several of which I did not see coming.  The problem is that the author spends the entire book building up your feelings about each of the characters and it's a disappointment at the end when they don't get what they deserve.  Amy was never held accountable for any of her actions her entire life and at the end she is still able to escape accountability.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I would recommend this mystery to any mystery reader as a quintessential Christie novel. The pacing is excellent and the characters are well developed, every day people.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|Hands down, one of the finest albums of the year.  Miss Marlene.....worth the price of admission. A great sounding organic hip listen for sure!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|First off, good luck finding another book as good as Beautiful Disaster. The quest for just that seems to be everyone's objective after they finish reading this book; me included. I've read several series before this - and several after. None will give you the same feeling as the roller coaster ride of Travis and \\"Pidge's\\" romance. So good!!
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Thought it was a great read.  The characters were compelling and the story, although, it started off slow, had a very satisfying ending.<br /><br />-WG
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Look, it's 2012. It's time that we stop running around chasing special effects in place of smart, well written stories. The plot in this film is frankly hilarious and improbable at best, cynical and stupid at worst. Without a good story, there is no dramatic tension. Without dramatic tension, there is no film. Period. I want my 2 hours back Ridley, I really do.<br /><br />I will refrain from citing specific examples save for this one. After our male lead visits the area of interest, all he does for the balance of the film's running time is toddle around drunkenly on the ship. He is effectively removed from the plot. Why was he introduced as a lead in the first place?<br /><br />Two 10 year old boys could come up with a better script over the lunchroom table. Pow Pow!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I've used the free version for quite a while before opting for the paid version to support a great app. I can't imagine going without it anymore. The percentage and time I have to charge is a lifesaver and I can't find anything wrong with it. Definitely a great app to have.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It has been a while, but having John Corey and Kate Mayfield back is pure pleasure.  The setting for The Panther is Yemen and the reader is taken on a deluxe tour of that county early in the book.  Seeing Yemen through John Corey's eyes is priceless.  Great reading!!
B005HEJLUO|2.0|This episode proved that it is much better to shoot at aliens with cool looking lasers than pretend that people watch Start Trek for intellectual or pyschological stimulation.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A deceptively simple looking game that provides hours of addictive fun. The tranquil classical music score and more organic and beautifully rendered graphics help provide a compelling puzzle game that is both challenging and relaxing when compared to similar games using tediously repetitive arcade music and boring design or a cast of silly characters. The overall gameplay and design and of Quill reflect raises it far above the mundane.
0316228532|4.0|In the manner of the time honored novel \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", J.K. Rowling has penned a classic look at small town pettiness and prejudice.  In \\"Casual Vacancy\\", Rowling holds our hidden agendas up to us for examination.  It is impossible not to be moved by this first adult fiction of a marvelous writer.
B002S0KBUY|5.0|“No one starts a war- or rather, no one in his sense ought to do so- without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intends to conduct it.“ CARL VON CLAUSEWITZ<br /><br />I was a bit hesitant to pick up this book to begin with. I have read a few other books of Jodi's and I know how beautiful her writing is but also, I know how she can easily pull your heart out of your chest and stamp on it... hard!<br /><br />I honestly thought, however, that I was prepared to read ‘My Sister's Keeper‘- I watched the film and was left hardly touched by it but of course nothing can prepare you for that gut wrenching final twist of hers, that comes just as you get that happy ending that she has worked towards the entire book. And I cried!<br /><br />Jodi's writing is consistent with her other stories and she effortlessly makes you fall in love with all her characters from the wayward Judge to the tear away son. I was gripped as soon as I started reading this book and I can now totally understand why, as soon as I mentioned to friends that I was reading it, they winced and said “ooh you're brave!\\"<br /><br />This story is gut wrenching, painful but amazing!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars. Anything less than 5 would be insulting it. I feel that watching all the other 4 movies about the acid spitting alien will help in understanding this movie. But that is my opinion.
B000FCKRDI|1.0|To me, dont even bother starting reading this book. It is so boring from the beginning that is ridiculous!!!! I wish I wouldnt spent my money on it....
B000MD9UJC|5.0|This LED conversion is very easy to install....no tools required....just 2 hands. Quality seems to be good and it works as described. I am not sure that having an on/off switch on the end is necessary since the factory switch has to be utilized at some point to adjust the beam. I still rated it  5 stars.
1476712042|4.0|I know it is a YA target audience and i might be kind of old for this type of stories, but what can i say ....i am a \\"junkie\\" when it comes to romance and happy endings.<br />I have read this book a few times now. I loved all the characters and reminded me my time in college. There is nothing like YOUNG LOVE...intese, passionate,protective, jealous, \\"making out\\", i cant breath or live without you kind of love; to fight and reconcile; Love, love love in every sense of the word.<br />Travis and Abby gives you just that...
B0087HT36U|5.0|cant wear the next level. to come. out.  how long is it going to take for the next level. to be released
030758836X|3.0|I enjoyed this book until the end. And although i dont want to spoiled for you I would say....IF this book would have had another ending, I would have given it four stars. However, the ending was nothing credible to me. I just did not buy it. IT WAS REALLY A SHAME, BECAUSE I ACTUALLY ENJOYED....
B008MM9630|5.0|This is one app i love to play on my kindle. The deals they offer for gems and pets and coins are pretty good considering the price of buying them separate. Love this app.
1476715904|3.0|This is a nice story. I cried, laughed and cried again. This love story captivated me by the fact that sometimes life is not all flowers and we must make lemonade from lemons. is a bitter-sweet story where despite the circumstances love prevails.
B004LKVHSY|4.0|Well done movie with an especially engaging performance by Elizabeth Shue. The script painted itself into a corner, in that any outcome more optimistic than the one we got would have been contrived, a happy ending for the sake of a happy ending. Nicholas Cage's character was expressly trying to drink himself to death. Once that gauntlet is thrown, the plot is kinda married to that outcome. Certainly the love of a good hooker is an item in the plus column, but not enough to lift a fella out of \\"the hole you're in,\\" unless you're making \\"Pretty Woman.\\" This is a nicely executed picture of a pocket of spiritual and emotional pus, but it's a god-awful view, and not much to be done about it.<br />  Which leads me to this - there are certain stories (The Doors, Wired, and now Leaving Las Vegas) in which the lead characters display precious little in the way of redeeming qualities, seem hell-bent on destroying themselves, and leave the viewer (me,certainly) wondering why we're supposed to care. None of the characters I've mentioned had it that bad; in fact, they all had kind of plum lives and, had they not thrown it away with both hands, could have retired happy and rich. I might have mustered more sympathy had they not been so resolutely not-likeable.<br />  All that aside, this is a well-acted and well-wrought film that achieves an elegiac tone, one that stays with you for a while. I don't see how any person could watch this movie and not take a long, hard look at his own foibles, and certainly not without rueing any part of his or her personality that isn't life affirming, and maybe THAT'S the point.
B009NSHZLW|1.0|I installed this App thinking it would actually play my movies. No it diddn't. In fact it did nothing. Once the software is launched all it does is announce itself audibly then that's it. Nothing. It's almost as if this is nothing. I have only given it one star because this medium doesn't allow me to score it any less otherwise I would have given it a complete zero.
B001KVZ6HK|1.0|The movie was great, this review is based on the 4 disk combo. First like others have stated the movies are stacked onto each other, than the issue with the digital copy. My son loves this movie witch is why I opt for the combo with the digital copy I figured I can transfer it to my samsung tab \\"WRONG\\" you cant even watch the digital copy of the movie on your computer. I get a msg stating that the license is not valid, whats the point of the digital copy if you cant use it.

B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom Selleck is my favorite. In this series one gets to know and care for the characters. The Jesse Stone series does all of that for me. Well written, well acted and I can watch these over & over.
B000002RXS|5.0|This is a great recording. Callas is genius in her choice of expression, and the orchestra is also wonderful. A must have for opera lovers.
630587493X|5.0|The movie begins as a family purchases a robot. All the humans eventually grow older except (Robin Williams) the robot. He soon realizes he has feelings as human beings have and pursues some sort of conformity to become a human being himself.<br />I've seen this movie years ago, and liked Robin Williams (the actor) in have many films with him starring in the leading roles. In this film his wit and humor becomes contagious, as does most his other roles.<br />I give it two thumbs-up as a comedy and family oriented movie.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|Using this app on my Galaxy S3. Loved it until I updated it yesterday and now the full feature aspect of the app is shot to pieces! 1) The themes are no longer. I'm stuck with the generic theme that comes with it. 2) The update requires that the old version, along with user data, be removed and the new version installed. This deleted all of the \\"learning\\" that the old version had done. Now it's back to square one. 3) The suggestions aren't as intuitive as they were before. I would hope that these issues are addressed soon.  At that point I'll go with 5 stars but until then it'll have to stay at 2.

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|One of the best loved movies of all time, in a deluxe 2 DVD set. I got the 40th Anniversary edition, and it's great!

B008FIHUDO|4.0|A great album from a great Detroit soul singer and the word \\"thankful\\" doesn't come close. Bettye LaVette is one of those singers who like Mavis Staples has never quite garnered the respect she deserves. She is lauded in critical circles and by lovers of soul, has paid her dues and then some; but the world is a cruel place and as more below par warblers are inflicted upon us in programmes like the X factor, true talent is sidelined. Bettye LaVette celebrates her 50th anniversary in the music business this year and it has seen her tour with the premier division of rhythm and blues musicians such Clyde McPhatter, Ben E. King, Barbara Lynn and Otis Redding. Her past is very colourful and her recently published autobiography \\"A Woman like me\\" is understood to be a salty good read.<br /><br />On \\"Thankful n Thoughtful\\" she produces an album which you listen to in marvel. That voice could sing the menu down the local Tandoori house and make you weep, just check out the two covers of Ewan MacColl's \\"Dirty old town\\" one very soulful the other so full of emotion its almost impossible to get that lump out of your throat. Her version of Neil Young's \\"Everyone knows this is nowhere\\" takes Shakey's plaintive country rock and infuses it with a passion that you never thought possible. Equally she turns Gnarls Barkley's pumping dance anthem \\"Crazy\\" into a haunting raw blues song that you should really seek out as a matter of urgency. Other great covers of the Black Keys \\"Im not the one\\", Patty Griffin's lovely \\"\\"Time will do the talking\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Everything is broken\\" are included and amply demonstrate the sheer versatility of an artist who has seen and done it all. However it is her New Orleans music hall version of Tom Waits \\"Yesterday is here\\" that steals the show. The late night bar stool philosophies and heartaches of Waits are the perfect backdrop for the hurt in LaVette's voice and she really should undertake a whole album of Waits covers and send that young Scarlett Johansson off with a flea in her ear. Why not take a punt and as we approach Christmas before your cursor hovers over the Amazon \\"add to basket\\" on artists like Emeli Sande or Adele go to the source of the river instead and honour one of the best women singers alive today.Johansson off with a flea in her ear.

1938469003|4.0|Excellent historical look at the style and evolution of IPA. A little disappointed in the recipes in the fact they weren't geared toward home brewers and require you to do conversions. All in all a good book.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this 2nd book in the trilogy, but I do not think that it is as good as the first.  I found the writing to be dumbed down to to about a middle school level.
B00913P6G0|4.0|I think I'm finally ready to write this. After my initial listen I was really disappointed with how this album turned out. All I kept reading was how good the story was and oh my god the story, the story. Well, in reality, the story is all over the place. Maybe it's too early in his career and Kendrick is too young to take on a project like this, but the end result is far from a classic.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if I was wrong, but I'll explain my interpretation of the story from my last listen. I say that because my interpretation has changed almost as much as my overall score has. Anyway, the album begins right in the middle. After the first song the album continues with \\"B***h, Don't Kill My Vibe\\" which has almost nothing to do with the story. Then on track three, \\"Backseat Freestyle,\\" the story picks up somewhere towards the beginning, but not the very beginning. You don't catch up to the beginning of the album until after track six, \\"Poetic Justice.\\" After that the story continues to the end. The album's final song is kind of tricky. Some people say it's present day Kendrick, but I think it's the very beginning of the story. Because after the song ends you hear him say he's borrowing the van. So possibly \\"Compton\\" is him in his room listening to music and reflecting on his city. I don't know.<br /><br />Honestly, this is my main issue with this album. It had so much potential and the story is really good, but the execution was terrible. I kept feeling like I was forcing pieces of the puzzle together when it should have fit together just right. Also, it feels like some people are using the \\"story\\" card to justify that some of the tracks on here, \\"Backseat Freestyle\\" & \\"Poetic Justice,\\" are in fact terrible. It was just an excuse for him to make some really corny songs that might garner some attention from people that wouldn't normally listen to him. The concept of \\"Backseat Freestyle\\" had a lot of potential, but he took the easy route. What would've been dope is if he actually spit a freestyle off the top. Instead we get a generic rap song with a \\"hook-verse\\" format.<br /><br />Another big issue is that on a very fundamental level most of the music doesn't reflect what's going on in the story. Which is another thing that made the story so damn hard to follow at first. The songs that do actually lend to the story are: \\"Sherane a.k.a. Master Splinter's Daughter,\\" \\"The Art of Peer Pressure,\\" \\"Money Trees,\\" the first verse of \\"good kid,\\" \\"Sing About Me, Dying of Thirst\\" & the first verse of \\"Real.\\" The others kind or brush upon the topic that was discussed in a previous skit, but nothing major. Another minor complaint is the fact that he combined \\"Sing About Me\\" and \\"Dying of Thirst\\" into one song. Two completely different songs made into one long ass track.<br /><br />As far as guests go they weren't terrible. Considering this is his major label debut I was expecting a lot worse. You get to hear verses from Jay Rock, Drake, MC Eiht, and Dr. Dre. Then you have Anna Wise providing hook support on \\"Real.\\" The only guest I have an issue with is Drake. Once again, it was an attempt to attract people that wouldn't necessarily check Kendrick out otherwise. Honestly, the only guest I truly agreed with was Anna Wise. In my opinion if you're doing a concept album like this you should be the only one with verses.<br /><br />I wasn't really impressed with the bonus songs either. I read one person say \\"They kind of continue the story after 'Compton',\\" but I think that's kind of reaching. The only song I can say I sort of liked was \\"Black Boy Fly.\\" If you're a fan of Kendrick I would recommend checking them out regardless. You might end up liking them.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"The Art of Peer Pressure,\\" \\"good kid\\" & \\"Real (Feat. Anna Wise)\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 8/10 - I'm going to borrow something I read online about this album. I don't remember who said it, but it went \\"Kendrick's album is good. I just wish I liked it more.\\" That's truly how I feel about this album. If he would've stuck to the hard storytelling that was present in the songs I mentioned earlier and if he would've made the story easier to follow then this definitely would've gotten a perfect score. With that said, I give props to Kendrick for not dumbing down his lyricism and trying something different in the commercial scene. He could've taken an entirely different path with this album, but he didn't. Honestly though the only people giving this a perfect score and calling it a classic are those that box themselves into what gets played on the radio. So of course this is going to sound godly to them. I'm not saying their opinion is wrong and mine is right, but it's the truth. There have been stronger albums that have come out this year.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The Hunger Games series tell an amazing and thought provoking tale.<br />The third and final book of the series is in many ways different from the two previous books and in some way it loses the touch that made these books special. It does not leave you thinking about your own actions as much as it leaves you in grief for the many dead. But it is still a well written book and it ties up the ending neatly.

B007XNAOS0|1.0|Genre doesn't matter, this isn't good metal or good rock. Yellow and Green doesn't suck because of fan's expectations from the artist, it sucks because it sucks. No matter what name you put on it, it sounds like run of the mill crap.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I really enjoyed the Percy Jackson series, I can only imagine how much that series helped spur interest in Greek mythology and I'm sure teachers are saying thank you to Rick Riordan everywhere. So when I heard he started a new series (Heroes of Olympus) with some of the characters from the first series, I knew I would like it. I think one of the reasons I enjoy books like this (it's for ages 10 and up, which makes me feel awesome) is they're quick and entertaining reads. There's romance, fighting, good vs. evil...all the life themes people never tire of.<br /><br />The first book, The Lost Hero, and second, The Son of Neptune, will soon be followed up by the Mark of Athena later this fall. According to the wondering Wiki, there will be four books total and I'm definitely looking forward to the rest!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This book kept my interest from beginning to end.  All the familiar characters are involved plus some surprising former ones.
0312641893|5.0|It took me a while to admit, but after reviewing some of my favorite books, one thing is clear: I have a ridiculous obsession with the fantasy/made up world/so far from reality genre of fiction. Not to say I don't love some good historical fiction, but when Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Percy Jackson and Eragon line my book shelf, there's no denying the evidence. That and apparently \\"young adult\\" fiction works great for 29 year old adults as well.<br /><br />When I came across Cinder (think Cinderella) by Marissa Meyer, a story set in the future complete with crazy lunar queens, androids and cyborgs, you can see why my interest was peaked. And who doesn't love a story about a handsome prince and a girl who defeats evil? Never gets old.<br /><br />I'll keep this short with four points:<br /><br />1. The only thing I was upset about was that this is the first book in series and now I have to wait for the next one to be published. To this I say boo! I still remember the anguish of waiting for the final HP.<br />2. One part totally caught me off guard and the person next to me at the airport probably thought I was loco for randomly saying \\"Wha???????\\" out loud to myself.<br />3. This takes place in New Beijing - awesome!<br />4. If you love the classic fairy tales, you'll enjoy seeing pieces of the fairy tale pop up throughout the book.<br /><br />Not only is Meyer's a fantastic writer, but it's refreshing to see young adult fiction out there that's incredibly creative, engaging and not about the same ol same ol that seems to be coming out in masses these days. I think this will turn out to be a great series and definitely recommend! It's a great read, quick, but entertaining also.

0812416503|5.0|Based off the amazon.com description, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what this story would entail.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Daphne du Maurier threw out some shockers with Rebecca. Where I got the idea there was an actual ghost involved, I have no clue. Maybe because it was written in 1938.<br /><br />It took me about three chapters to get into the story and then came page 264. What I read on this page may have been the greatest shock of my book reading life.<br /><br />After page 264 I read for 4 hours straight, forgoing dinner because I HAD TO FINISH. I was still in shock after  I finished it.<br /><br />Without giving too much away (because you should really read it), I'll say just a few more things:<br /><br />I wanted to punch Mrs. Danvers in the face the entire book (I hated her character almost as much as Dolores Umbridge from Harry Potter)<br />I thought the development of the new Mrs. de Winters was fantastic (she annoyed the heck out of me for quite a while)<br />I'm a fan of Beatrice<br />I'm still in shock at the turn of events. Days later, writing this review..my brain is thinking \\"Wha?\\" Talk about a good story. Usually I can predict the basic story line. Not this one folks. Not this one.<br />Read it!
B004G5ZY7E|4.0|If this was my first Harry Hole book to read I would be thrilled. Jo Nesbo really gets a grip on the reader. I needed to fight against reading the book at one go. However after several Harry Hole books this doesn't feel as fresh as before. Yes, Jo Nesbo does create rather interesting portraits of human nature, the story flows very well, but the reason why I didn't give 5 stars is the fact that the book feels like a movie. Compared to thrillers from other authors it is still a breeze of cold Norwegian air that makes you want more.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey makes me laugh. Her first book involving such things as car creepery, white denim suits, fires on her honeymoon cruise and \\"manually releasing her butt cheeks\\" after an encounter with Sylvester Stallone on SNL are just a few examples of the random, yet hilarious stories you'll find in Fey's Bossypants.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Saturday Night Live, then you should definitely read this book. While I'm not a diehard fan of the show, I do appreciate a good laugh and SNL has provided a few good chuckles. Part of her story gives an inside look at the life of an SNLer. I sometimes find myself thinking anyone famous (actor/singer/athlete) has it easy once they \\"make it.\\" But of course it's quite the opposite. Anyone who is great at their job is great because they work really hard (of course talent plays a part), but when you are doing what you love, you'll naturally work harder. I think it goes hand in hand.<br /><br />As a bonus, Tina shows you how to balance Oprah, playing Palin and making sure your daughter's birthday party is perfect, in case you ever find yourself in that situation.<br /><br />One of my favorite chapters was her response to crazy hate mail (people are insane and mean). Not only does she respond with humor, but provides a great example that you just can't let every loco person get to you. I'm thinking people's hate mail stems from jealousy. Why else would you call someone a troll?<br /><br />Even if you don't agree with her on every subject or topic, she's honest, funny and willing to share the good and the not so good about her life. And all with a touch of humor. After reading her book I feel like we're friends. So in my mind, I'm just going to keep thinking that.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this...I pin all of the time!  Especially now that I can use my Kindle Fire to do so!  I highly recommend...you can find ideas on how to do mostly anything.  You won't be disappointed!
0525952926|3.0|I'm so disappointed to report that Ken Follett has become a cheap imitation of his former self. He has seldom been able to resist the impulse to throw in some overly fantastic coincidences but this book seemed one circumstance after another that stretched the reader to their limit as far as suspension of doubt. It was ok, overall, but just that - okay. I so very much looked forward to receiving my pre-ordered copy of this book. I'm not anticipating the next volume in The Century Trilogy at all. Pillars of the Earth and World Without End were some of my favorite books of all time. I need to start managing my expectations for Ken Follett in the future.

But, I figured it who it was and bought the cassette and immediately fell in love The Blue Nile.  I eventually replaced the cassette with a CD, which was even better.<br /><br />Every song on the album is excellent.  My favorites are &#34;Headlights on the Parade&#34; and &#34;From a Late Night Train,&#34; though I do love every song on the disc.  The lyrics and music are gut-wrenching.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|My daughter recommended this book to me, and frankly, I only started it because I had nothing else to read, but I am glad that I gave it a chance.  It was a bit more violent than I like, and if you are looking for storybook endings, then keep on looking. There are no storybook endings when it comes to the ugly politics of power and royalty.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the last book of the trilogy.  Even though this series is marketed to young adults, I loved it, and I am 55 years old.  There were plenty of characters, and plenty of surprises.  All the main characters were three-dimensional. If you liked the movie, The Hunger Games, then you must read all three books.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I loved Shadow and all the Gods.  A lot of twists and turns.  I would have liked to have been given a bit more info on each of the Gods, but I think the book would have to be a thousand pages for that.  When I read the preview of this book, I really could not imagine how the ancient Gods were even relevant in the 21st century, but the author has a great imagination and executed it perfectly.

B008Y5OW20|5.0|I just received my copy of Long Wave yesterday and I've already listened to it three times going on a fourth. Lynne's rendition of these timeless classic is truly incredible. He's not trying to imitate the originals...nor is he trying to make these better than the originals. He's just giving us HIS renditions of these great songs. I love that he chose Running Scared as part of the collection paying homage to his old friend Roy Orbison. You don't have to be a fan of ELO to enjoy these tunes. The production is flawless and his voice is as smooth as ever. I wish there were at least 10 more songs on the CD but as they say, a great artist always leaves his audience wanting more. I just pray he doesn't wait another 20 years before putting out another solo album.

It is a long and unforgiving journey to the finale (which pretty much changed the comic book industry as we know it). Watchmen has been virtually praised by all, even making Time magazine's list of 100 greatest literary works of the 20th century serving as the only graphic novel to ever grace that list, now that is saying something.<br /><br />What makes Watchmen such a good book is not the fact that it's a superhero novel or that it's one of a kind. It's really the fact that it's a superhero novel about superheroes. Going to great lengths to do delve beyond the psychology behind being a 'super-hero', what it's like, individual motives and the sacrifice of what it takes. The book is very long and there is probably more dialogue in it than any other graphic novel out there. If you're a fan of the movie but have never read the novel start here to find out why the movie is so faithful.
0385536828|3.0|Okay, so let's take a look at the \\"disengaging\\" cast of characters in SWEET TOOTH.  First we have Serene Frome, the daughter of an Anglican bishop and avid but uncritical literary sponge who having been disappointed by an affair with a professor is recruited by and accepts a low level job with MI5.  At what appears to be warp speed, the gullible lass is offered an opportunity to take part in a surreptitious operation with the codename SWEET TOOTH and for all practical intents and purposes becomes a spy.  Next we have Thomas Haley academic and writer of anti-capitalist fiction who is the target of Serena's assignment as well as her \\"love interest\\".....although I would like to make a personal observation and state categorically that while \\"love\\" for Serene appears to be a series of emotionally detached sex acts and this \\"sexual self-confidence\\" is not only irritating - it simply will not ring true to most female readers.  Serena's first \\"love\\" Tony Canning is another unlikable piece of work and a majority of the secondary characters pop in and out of the story like children playing a game of hide and seek. Overall most of the characters in this book are not very likable or even believable- - of course likability is not necessarily a pre-requisite for a good read but believability is.<br /><br />Set in early 1970's England the book explores the rampant misogyny within government organizations as well as the continuing battle between a government attempting to win the war of ideas and ideals against a radicalized intellectual elite, via covert methods. It also addresses a question concerning artists and writers which is \\"When does writing become political, rather than personal, propaganda\\" and how concerned should a government be?<br /><br />Part spy story, part love story and part \\"thinly veiled journey into the author's life and personal political propaganda\\", SWEET TOOTH is a first person narrative whose spokesperson is part of the mystery.  While not as crushingly boring as other McEwan works like SATURDAY and SOLAR, neither is it exceptional.  At best, this is just an okay read.oring as other McEwan works like SATURDAY and SOLAR, neither is it exceptional.  At best, this is just an okay read.

0525958002|5.0|I had to get this because it was John Taylor. He was my first rockstar crush. I figured it would be fun to read and at least entertaining. Personally I got more out of it than that. I didn't realize he was such a music geek; and there's a lot of music geekdom in the first third of the book. Second, some of the stuff he chose to share about his growing up really helped me think about my own family. My family is very different, but the way he shared it was very insightful and truly did help me think about my own family. And third, reading about what was going on in his life during the rest of the eighties kind of brought pieces of that time and my own experience of that time back to me. I dunno. There are many billions of people on the earth, and just a handful of those people influence you in your lifetime. Some of those people are people you know personally, and some of those people are famous. You don't know them personally, but for whatever reason, they resonate with you. So if one of those people writes a book like this, it's worth reading, because in a way, their story is also a part of your own life, even though it's also very separate from your own life. Anyway. He didn't do a book signing in my hometown, but if he had, I would have said, \\"Thanks for sharing.\\" And that would have been sincere, not sarcastic.

B009IKPOUO|5.0|This is a must for all Streisand fans.  As you listen you can almost identify the year each of these songs were recorded by the timbre in her voice.  If this is any indication of music Barbra wasn't worthy of release before, I wonder what other gems does she have hidden.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is a N.Y. Metropolitan Opera Ring series from about 20 years ago.  I remembered seeing it then on PBS when it was televised on consecutive nights.  I have to admit that I taped those performaces and have watched them several times since then.  Alas!  VHS tapes degrade woefully over 20 years.  I thoroughly enjoyed these performances then and I thoroughly enjoy them now.<br /><br />I am not an opera wonk so I am sure that there are lots of refinements that escape me as to these performances, or any other for that matter.  But I find these to be wonderful productions. These are not in the least \\"quirky\\" like some I have seen.  Throughout the voices are solid, as actors the performers are engaging, their voices are as good as any I have heard in these roles, and the costuming and staging are both imaginative and effective.  Maestro Levine gets a rich and energetic performance out of his orchestra - especially important with Wagner, in my opinion.<br /><br />The recordings are very good.  Captioning is available in English, German, and French.  I have watched it with the English captions and with the German captions - not that I understand German but I like to be able to see the actual words as they are being sung.  One minor glitch:  On the disc for Das Rheingold there seems to be a repetition of one part of a scene of a \\"conversation\\" between Wotan and Loge.  I don't think this diminishes the watching experience at all.  (Maybe it's there just to see if the watcher is really paying attention?)<br /><br />In any event, I would recommend this set without reservation.
B004SYP5WC|5.0|Absolutely love this app. It helps me keep organized with my bills. I use it every month.  You can set up notifications to remind you when a bill is do. This is a great app worth the money.
0743297334|2.0|A meandering novel with many meaningless conversations that really don't amount to very much. There were a few high-lights - the bull-fighting scenes towards the end were, I suppose, vintage Hemingway. Also the setting at the fishing village (or vacation spot) had the beginnings of some introspection, but was not taken very far. The first one hundred pages in Paris were repetitive and bland.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The \\"stars\\" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!
1936608898|5.0|Reading about the Whole30 online, I was excited, but felt I needed to know more.  So I bought the book.<br /><br />It changed my life.<br /><br />I was already wheat and dairy-free, with very little alcohol, and no sweeteners except a teensy bit of molasses or sucanat when absolutely, unequivocally called for.  So, I didn't expect the 30-day switch (to no grains, legumes, dairy, sweeteners, or alcohol, and no overeating or emotional eating allowed), to be that profound.<br /><br />I was so wrong.<br /><br />It changed the way I relate to food (something I have struggled with my whole life). And halfway through my challenge, when my aunt (who struggles with GERD and thyroid issues) saw how good I looked, she started right away, too.  And it changed her life.  She cooks for her husband, so it changed his life.  Now, 3 months later, my parents are on board with no dairy, no grains, no legumes, and it's changed THEIR lives.  My sister's reading it, too.<br /><br />I've done a lot of research regarding food and nutritional science.  \\"The End of Overeating,\\" \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories,\\" \\"Deep Nutrition,\\" \\"Real Food,\\" \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma,\\" all of Mark Bittman's books...It's all important.  But if you're struggling, this is the book to start with.  Read those books about the science and history and sad, sad state of the American diet later, when you're feeling better (because your Whole30 is a success, because you did your homework and read this book).

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really loved this series! A lot better than I expected. I really enjoyed the story line and the characters.
0525953728|4.0|\\"No Easy Day\\" is the story behind the mission that ended in the death of Osama Bin Laden. The author, whose alias is Mark Owen, not only describes the details behind the infamous mission, but also tells us the story of what made him want to become a Navy Seal and his military career.<br /><br />The strongest part of the book is far and away the chapters telling of Bin Laden's demise. It's a thrilling and intense description of one of the most significant moment's in recent memory. The last few chapters of the novel are dedicated to this and Owen presents the chain of events in great detail.<br /><br />There are a few problems I have the book. First of all, the pacing is very uneven. The author jumps from story to story pretty quickly, leaving the reader confused and slightly annoyed. While the portion of the book dealing with Bin Laden's death are thrilling, the rest of the book is kind of mediocre. A look into the life of a Seal is fascinating, but I feel like the first two-thirds of the book could have been condensed into 50 pages.<br /><br />Another issue I have with the book is that it's written in present tense. The book could have been a lot stronger if Owen had simply recalled the events instead of making the book read like the events were happening real time.<br /><br />Finally, a problem with the prologue. Owen claims his love of the Navy began when he read a book in middle school describing stories from the battlefield. He hopes his book will inspire similar feelings in today's youth. The problem I have with this is that there is a lot of language in the book that I wouldn't want my middle school-aged child reading. While I know members of the military are no strangers to cursing, and I personally don't have a problem with vulgarity in books, I thought this notion was a little hypocritical.<br /><br />The book without the Bin Laden mission would only get three stars but because that part of the book is so insightful and fascinating, I'm adding another star..

B006HGXGWU|2.0|I honestly cant recall watching another movie as straight up boring as this one was. And i thought about it for quite awhile before making that statement just to be sure I wasnt going to say something that was an exaggeration. Normally i would've shut this movie off after watching about 30-40 minutes of uninteresting, unentertaining nothingness. But because of the 7.1 IMDb rating and the 80% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, i stuck with the whole movie thinking the entire time that because of those high marks, that this movie has just got to get better eventually. BUT NOPE! It remained thoroughly uninteresting, unentertaining and VERY BORING throughout. The only reason i gave this 2 stars and not 1 star is because of the dialoge and how it was recited. The words they spoke and the way the actors delivered those lines were very realistic. Like the way real people in real life speak and communicate with each other. For me, that was the only good thing about this waste of 2 hours of my life film. To me, this was an utter pointless waste of celluloid. And im not an action movie junkie or anything like that. I dont mind a slow-paced movie as long as it has a good story and a point to it with a satisfying ending. This movie had none of that. Only painfully sloooow and booooring.

There are at least 10 recipes that need to come out of my kitchen ASAP. I am an avid follower of Deb's blog and was very pleasantly surprised that most of the book was new content, but still recipes and writing in the vein of what is on the blog. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves food, likes to cook, or just loves to lust over the beautiful photographs!
B001W2I9Y4|4.0|As a fan of rock and metal, I nevertheless did not encounter Mastodon for a very long time.  This was my first purchase from the band - previously I'd taken a swing at \\"Blood Mountain\\" but didn't find it appealing.  Decided to check this out during one of Amazon's $5 MP3 sales.<br /><br />It does not disappoint... it's hard throughout, but musically diverse.  The somewhat odd theme carries the album well, and truly enough the vocalist's style - a kind of tight wail, like a much nastier Geddy Lee - fits well.  If you don't appreciate weird tempos and abrupt time changes, you won't like this - it's occasionally hard to just \\"listen\\" to the music because of the asynchronous melodies.  That's part of its charm, though.  It's the kind of album that requires multiple listens to fully appreciate - so far I've listened to it a dozen or more times.<br /><br />I've never heard anything quite like it, and am looking forward to checking out more of their music.

B005FITIK0|1.0|This movie is awful.  It is proof that you cannot make a good movie by simply putting an academy award winning actress in it, even when her performance was incredibly good.<br /><br />The story is utterly non sequential nonsense with no dialogue continuity.  Theron's character is a 37 year old alcoholic who discovers her high school boyfriend just had a baby, and she decides to try and win him back.  The first 5 minutes of the movie show her in her self absorbed, narcissistic pointless life, having a one night affair, and leaving the guy in her bed as she dons a Hello Kitty shirt and drives off in her Mini Cooper to the little town in Minnesota where she grew up.  This short time is supposed to introduce you to this terribly flawed human.  She then arrives at a bar where a guy - who in high school she would not have (and did not) even notice - recognizes her, and they *immediately* strike up an in depth conversation demonstrating both of them as flawed and life abused.  Nonsense.  The guy is a cripple, apparently having been beaten to an inch of his life by a bunch of jocks who thought he was gay, to the point his penis is \\"bent.\\"  This poor cripple - who does not even know the former boyfriend, then goes to some great length to try and disabuse the woman from her youth-recapture effort.  Nonsense.<br /><br />The story is so bad - there are multiple characters that are randomly introduced, who have some \\"small town\\" connection to the main character, and then they disappear.  Why?  For example, in a bar scene, a guy in a wheel chair appears - turns out he is one of those happy go lucky wheel chair bound people and the cousin of Theron's character?  Wait, what?  So what?  Why?  Pointless.  The dialogue here is just stupid.<br /><br />This is not a black comedy.  If that is what they were shooting for, they missed it by a mile and then some.  Someone else compared this to Christian Bale's effort in American Psycho.  Trust me, there is NO COMPARISON.  American Psycho pulls you into the main character's psychosis.  You want to watch a *masterful* black comedy - watch Kevin Spacey in [[ASIN:B003VJTGLQ American Beauty (Sapphire Series) [Blu-ray]]].  That movie defines the genre.  Black comedies are often narrated - this movie is not narrated.  They are narrated because it is hard to convey the rich flaws in just 2 hours of visual work.  This movie has effectively no sound score that builds either momentum or suspense.<br /><br />In the end, this is a movie with a bunch of sad people doing sad depressing things.  And the end of the movie . . .  I won't spoil it because it cannot be spoiled . . . she just drives off.  This movie is like listening to a musician who plays technically perfect with no soul or musical sense.<br /><br />When I looked here at the rating I was flabbergasted to see 5 star reviews.  Many of the scenes mentioned that were allegedly \\"hilarious\\" are so awful I literally was squirming.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the horrible script, lack of plot, lack of direction, lack of remotely suspenseful music or soundtrack and implausible dialogue . . . if there is a redeeming part of this movie, it was Ms. Theron's performance.  Her acting range is extreme, and some of the \\"evil\\" looks she gives to the boyfriends wife . . . sends chills down your back.  Her performance, as good as it was, simply does not save this horrible, horrible waste of celluloid.<br /><br />-mikells you into the main character's psychosis.

B003O85W44|5.0|While I have been listening to The Arcade Fire for years through iTunes, this is my first vinyl record by them.  The production is excellent, but not too refined as to sound overly polished.  The album still communicates the angst and frustration with modern western society through their signature sound.  It is by far my favorite Arcade Fire album yet.  The songs flow naturally from one track to the next in a way that reminds me of Abbey Road.  It is a record you will want to reserve some time to be able to listen to all the way through.  If, like me, this is your first Arcade Fire vinyl record, you will never want to listen to another Arcade Fire MP3 again.  The sound is warm, deep, and complex.  The medium brings to light every note and instrument.  The music truly comes to life though your speakers.  If you are not a vinyl convert, this album will make you one.
B009ESIGHI|3.0|On this date, January 3, 2013, I moved my review that 850 of 927 people found helpful over seven years.  It has been the top-rated review for THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL all this time and has been the first review you see on the product site, but I moved it because I no longer have any hope that Disney will ever issue the movie properly, so what is the point of keeping up the review? As soon as I delete it, its top rating will vanish and it will become only another ordinary review at this spot, where it may help somebody. Peace!<br /><br />Oh well, the bottom-line purpose of my 2005 review was mainly to encourage Disney to release the COMPLETE MOVIE (that is, with \\"When Love Is Gone\\") in WIDESCREEN in THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION available--ALL AT THE SAME TIME! What a concept!<br /><br />So here it is 7 years later and Disney has released the movie in high-resolution Blu-ray, in widescreen, but an INCOMPLETE version. So close but so far away! The 1993 Laserdisc was complete and widescreen and wonderful! Then since the dawn of DVD, I've been waiting for the next high-resolution widescreen complete version: the 2002 DVD was a bust, as was the 2005 DVD, and now the Blu-ray is pathetic.<br /><br />The fact is that I'm old enough now that I may not be alive when Disney releases the \\"next best\\" high-resolution format, whatever that may be. And Disney doesn't seem inclined to ever again release the film properly or take notice of those of us who sincerely consider the song a vital part of the movie. Frankly that is insulting. Though it's nice to know that many folks agree with me, it is truly disturbing that the Disney people could easily do the perfectly reasonable, common-sense RIGHT thing--but don't! My sounding off till doomsday hasn't done anything. I've tried to persuade them with logic (see below) for seven years till I'm blue in the face, only to be either unnoticed or blown off. And the worst of it is that with Blu-ray technology, Disney could have solved this problem any number of ways, yet they persist in ignoring the simple concept of preserving the integrity of this Brian Henson Christmas classic. Instead of fixing a problem, they made it worse!<br /><br />Thanks to all who have supported the proper presentation of Brian Henson's PERFECT movie THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL!<br /><br />P.S. I just had to get a Widescreen \\"fix\\", and so I put on the 2005 DVD for a few minutes, and, of course, it was preceded with a trailer for another Disney movie, THE LADY AND THE TRAMP. The scene in the preview was the delightful one where Tramp shyly rolls the meatball over to Lady with his nose with the beautiful song \\"Bella Notte\\" in the background and then they wind up eating the same strand of spaghetti and . . . kiss!  Well, it occurred to me that if Disney was so hot \\"into\\" cutting great scenes from its movies, this would be a great one to remove! Of what possible value is it--other than it is at the heart and core of the film, much like the \\"When Love Is Gone\\" scene in THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL?<br /><br />PLEASE, DISNEY, I'M ON MY KNEES. PLEASE MAKE THINGS RIGHT BY **QUICKLY** RELEASING THE COMPLETE MOVIE WITH \\"WHEN LOVE IS GONE\\" IN WIDESCREEN IN THE HIGHEST RESOLUTION ALL AT THE SAME TIME! PLEASE DO THE RIGHT THING INSTEAD OF THE COMMERCIAL THING. Read the reviews.  There are lots of unhappy people out there! It should be obvious by now that the home video version of the movie is a MUCH LOVED CHRISTMAS TRADITION FOR WHOLE GENERATIONS--for 20 years.  You are messing with people's memories!  Someone suggested that you may have lost the widescreen masters of the scene with the song.  Well, in that case, the Widescreen Laserdisc exists.  Isn't there a way to digitally \\"cut and paste\\" the scene from the Laserdisc over to Blu-ray and enhance it as much as possible.  The worst thing that could happen is that you'd sell more discs!  Thank you for your attention and Merry Christmas.<br /><br />-----------<br /><br />Today is November 6, 2012. Itis now official that today the Disney Company, in their infinite wisdom, released the Blu-ray of this movie WITHOUT the Paul William's song \\"When Love is Gone,\\" which has been a fixture in all home video versions of the movie since 1993. The Muppet Christmas Carol's legions of fans have grown up with the home video version--NOT the original theatrical version that does not include the song--and I suppose that most of its hundreds of thousands of fans love the movie just as they remember it  . . . from home video . . . WITH the song. How many viewers have watched this movie at home during the last 20 years? For however many that might be--and I'm sure it is a huge number--\\"When Love Is Gone\\" is simply a part of the movie as they've always known it.  So why on earth would Disney release the Blu-ray with this severe cut of a song that thousands (millions?) of video viewers expect... and have every right to expect? For these viewers, the song being cut out is brutally jarring! And as I've said before, this film is a work of art and deserves better.<br /><br />I originally wrote the below review in 2005 in anticipation of the second DVD release of the movie that year. During the seven years since then, more than 700 customers have checked that my review has helped them. Frankly I'm grateful that I could have been of service. And since this new flawed 2012 Blu-ray release has appeared SEVEN years after the previous flawed 2005 release, I suppose it is safe to say that another SEVERAL years must pass before Disney reissues the movie again, and there is absolutely no evidence that the company will EVER heed the general outcry for THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL to be released COMPLETE (as it was in the 1993 Laserdisc version) in WIDESCREEN WITH THE SONG INTACT IN A HIGH-RESOLUTION FORMAT--all at the same time!<br /><br />Some say that the original theater release (of perhaps a couple of months duration) lacked the song and, thus, the 2012 releases are \\"true\\" to the original. That may be true, but can that possibly trump the fact that all home video versions in the US have included the song since 1993, and is therefore the only version nearly anybody has ever known?  There are others who say that Disney made a commercial decision because its surveys indicate that some children wiggle through \\"When Love is Gone.\\" But isn't it hypocritical to be so concerned about childish wiggling when children are regularly traumatized by the shooting of Bambi's mother, the murder of the Lion King's dad, and the decimation of Nemo's whole family, and any number of other atrocities foisted on children over the years in the name of drama. And then, there is the simple fact that TIME has proven that THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL is not just another children's movie; it has become a classic of the first water, a cinematic work of art, on the order of SNOW WHITE, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and SINGING IN THE RAIN. Yet for some inexplicable reason, the Disney company refuses to acknowledge this and continues to treat THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL as only a children's movie! A glance through these reviews should prove that it is as much an important adult movie as a kid's movie. Yes, I'm sure the Blu-Ray shows magnificent \\"to-die-for\\" high-resolution, but such a PLUS does not outweigh for me the downside that the movie is INCOMPLETE. I suppose I could, as I suggest myself further down, juggle two different formats of the movie in order to play the song in the appropriate spot, but, let's face it, that takes the fun out of the whole experience! I wish I could buy the Blu-Ray in good conscience . . . but that is impossible!<br /><br />You'd think they could include the complete movie as an \\"Easter Egg\\" at the very least!<br /><br />Well, I'm whistling into the wind because, as I type, the movie is FLYING off Amazon's shelves. I'm not sure what that means. Whether customers don't notice or care, whether the discs are being bought mainly for indiscriminating children, you can bet that Disney feels affirmed in their decision to remove the song from the Blu-ray. Very very Sad. For me it's exactly like cutting out \\"Over the Rainbow\\" from The Wizard of Oz, which, by the way, some executives would have done if they had gotten their way, back in the day. All that I can figure is that the business executives at Disney over the years haven't ever understood that the film (with the song) is a genuine classic, a genuine work-of-art, and should be respected and studied every bit at much as, say, \\"Singing in the Rain\\" or \\"Rashomon\\".<br /><br />The complete version (widescreen and song included) plays perfectly. In every possible way it is perfect: the design, the casting, the songs and music, the costumes, the Muppet humor, the AMAZING attention to detail right out to the edges of the picture (which is why the widescreen version is so important) ... I can go on and on. To NOT keep \\"WHEN LOVE IS GONE\\" in the film is like cutting out \\"Rosebud\\" and the snow globe breaking at the beginning of CITIZEN KANE; it is the motivation for everything that happens in the movie. Closer to home, can you imagine the Disney classic SNOW WHITE without the \\"Mirror, mirror on the wall\\" scene? It too is the motivation for the whole movie. Would SNOW WHITE make sense if that scene was cut?<br /><br />Purely and simply, \\"When Love Is Gone\\" should be reinstated. THE BLU-RAY SHOULD BE RECALLED, THE SONG PUT IN ITS PROPER PLACE AND in all subsequent versions of the movie. PERIOD. BTW, it's a beautiful Paul William's song, as wonderful as all the songs in the movie.<br /><br />My first experience of this movie was the widescreen Laserdisc about 1993. When DVD became a format about 1997, I looked forward to the DVD version of this movie...but I had to wait nine years until 2002...but, guess what? It was a terrible Pan&Scan! I was very disappointed! So, I had to wait until 2005 for the next DVD release...and guess what? There were two versions of the movie on this disc--the same Pan&Scan from the earlier release PLUS a nice widescreen version THAT DID NOT INCLUDE \\"WHEN LOVE IS GONE\\"!  I was so incredibly disappointed!  Well, I rationalized, the NEXT version should correct that mistake and include the WHOLE movie in widescreen.  What a concept! So I waited ANOTHER seven years, and heard the Blu-ray was coming...and guess what...? Well you know the answer to that one!  I've been waiting 19 (nineteen) years for the next high-resolution of this movie beyond Laserdisc, and the Disney Company made the commercial decision this year to REMOVE the song entirely from its 2012 Blu-ray. I FEEL BETRAYED! TOTALLY AND UTTERLY BETRAYED...19 years is a long time...and guess what?  I find I can't watch ABC anymore, the Disney network. I saw LINCOLN the other day, and when I saw that it was partly financed by Disney, I felt sick. The only reason I didn't get up and leave was because my wife was with me. Basically I find myself avoiding anything Disney! My feeling is that all the good that Disney does from now on simply does not make up for this betrayal! It's incomprehensible...and very sad!]]<br /><br />It's clear that the Disney folks have zero motivation to EVER heed or respect the call to include \\"When Love Is Gone\\" in a complete Widescreen High-resolution format. Here follows my original 2005 review. At the end are some further thoughts about the abortive Blu-ray.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Review of 2005 DVD Release:<br /><br />While the complete widescreen version (WITH the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\") of this film is worth five+ stars, THIS 2005 DVD IS NOT THAT VERSION. This 2005 DVD release is a mess and gets 3 1/2 stars. See explanation below.)<br /><br />In Oct. 2002, Disney Home Video released its first DVD formatted THE MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL.  The response was both pro and con.  The response that was negative dealt with two primary issues:<br /><br />(1)  That  the 2002 DVD was pan-and-scan (AKA \\"full screen\\" or \\"1.33:1\\") instead of widescreen, and, in fact, unlike many DVDs, did not even offer the viewer a choice between pan-and-scan and widescreen.  For fans of the movie who prefer widescreen, this was a great disappointment!<br /><br />(2)  That the 2002 DVD for Region 2 and perhaps other regions also removed the \\"When Love Is Gone\\" song.  Disney has not, to my knowledge, offered an explanation for the removal.  I would guess that it was because the song is \\"sad\\" and someone at Disney probably decided that such a \\"sad\\" song did not belong on a DVD intended for children.<br /><br />Thus, that 2002 DVD had TWO strikes against it as far as MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL purists were concerned. At the Amazon site for that earlier DVD, you can find more than 130 reviews, many of which express PROFOUND disappointment about the lack of widescreen and the missing song. (Note: Amazon has unaccountably merged those 2002 reviews with the 2005 reviews. Just got toward the end of the list to see the older reviews.)<br /><br />Fast forward to 2005, just a couple of months ago.  Disney announced a new release of this film--The Muppet Christmas Carol - Kermit's 50th Anniversary Edition.  Eager fans immediately assumed that this would be the long-awaited anamorphic widescreen version. However, various statements and press releases listed the movie as 1.33:1 or, in other words, pan-and-scan.  When this was discovered, the fans HOWLED at what seemed like a betrayal and an absence of common-sense by the people at Disney.  THEN, within a few days of the official announcement, Disney \\"back-peddled\\" and issued a new announcement that the first one was in error and that the 50th Anniversary version would be in BOTH pan-and-scan and widescreen.  The ***SIGH*** of relief was like a wind that rushed across the globe!<br /><br />But now comes the TRICKY PART that tries to answer your specific question.  Some fans who have contacts within the industry or have means of mining the Internet, discovered that the CONTENT of the pan-and-scan and the widescreen versions that would be on the same disc would be different in that one would have the afore mentioned song and one would not. As mentioned HERE in these reviews for this new release, apparently the version to contain the song is the pan-and-scan version--which, if it's true--is a totally incomprehensible creative decision. (Why would the the version that was TRUE to the widescreen format be missing the song, thereby compromising that version?)<br /><br />Right now, as a GIANT FAN of MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL, who has longed for a widescreen DVD since the advent of DVD, I am hoping that there has been some miscommunication going on (for example, look above at the official aspect ratio listed in the Product Details. On today's date of Oct. 13, 2005, it's listed as 1.33:1, so the facts about this release seem to be unfortunately garbled!)<br /><br />Incidentally, there exists a WIDESCREEN (though obviously not anamorphic) Laserdisc version of the film that INCLUDES the song \\"When Love Is Gone.\\"  I know because I own it . . . and it is among my most precious possessions!!<br /><br />All we can do is wait until November 29 to find out what this new release will truly hold.  I  personally hope there will be an anamorphic widescreen version that also includes \\"When Love Is Gone.\\"<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  Well, yesterday was November 29, 2005, and I picked up this DVD.  There's good news, bad news, and some qualified good news.  The anamorphic widescreen image far exceeds any previous video or DVD version.  However, the rumours are TRUE that the widescreen does NOT include the wonderful song \\"When Love Is Gone,\\" and that the fullscreen version DOES include it as \\"Extended with Deleted Scene.\\"  However, for the diehard, there is this awkward-but-workable compensation:  The two versions are on the same side of the DVD, thus when the widescreen version comes to the point when the song should be sung, you can use your remote to go back to the menu, choose fullscreen, go to chapter 5, listen to the song, and then go back to widescreen to view the rest of this glorious Christmas movie. It is a BIG pain and an unfathomably poor decision by the suits at Disney!<br /><br />Since a complete widescreen version obviously does exist in the Disney archives (the Laserdisc version in the mid 90s was both widescreen AND complete), one can only wonder how and why Disney made this very insensitive and unprofessional decision!<br /><br />Neverthless, FINALLY having MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL in anamorphic widescreen is definitely a plus. Being able to see all the Muppet antics clear to the sides of the screen is a pure joy, and not being forced to watch tastelessly SQUISHED images is a tremendous relief! Also, this disk is the best resolution (though not perfect) that has ever been available in any home media format, and the Dolby Digital sound is quite acceptable.<br /><br />Since this is likely to be the last DVD version of this movie for quite some time, we should (1) continue to ponder Disney's callous obliviousness and its clear childish stubbornness to do what's right, while (2) counting our blessings that at least we are nonetheless PART way to the ideal MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL DVD.<br /><br />Talk about MIXED emotions!  I think that one problem is that nobody at Disney is clear that the film is a true WORK OF ART, instead of \\"just a movie stamped out for kids.\\" I think nobody there realizes that the film deserves far more respect than the grudging, lackluster, shoddy efforts they have so far foisted on the public.  I am very pleased to see the many astute reviewers for this new edition over and again make this point exceedingly clear!  THE WORST OF IT IS THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!<br /><br />BTW, on November 29, 2005, Garan Grey posted a review mentioning several EXCELLENT points underscoring Disney's faulty decision-making--especially about the lackluster special features, recycled menu design, and so forth, in what is supposed to be a very special \\"special edtion\\"!  However, this reviewer says: \\"By the way, it seems that the \\"widescreen\\" version is just matted down from the full 35mm 1.33 frame, so the fullscreen version is not missing any of the picture.\\" In point of fact, ALL pan&scan versions that I have seen (INCLUDING the pan&scan on this very disc) SQUISHES the titles, cuts Muppets off the sides of the movie, and even sometimes squishes scenes so the characters look tall and skinny.  Which is WHY I have been waiting for the widescreen for years!  In general, I'd say that Garan Grey is definitely incorrect on this point.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />November 6, 2012<br />What follows are some of my thoughts on hearing about the abortive 2012 Blu-ray:<br /><br />To Whom It May Concern At Walt Disney Studios: This Movie Is A Work Of Art<br /><br />It is worth listing here the various versions of the movie that have been released at different times:<br /><br />(a) Original theatrical release WITHOUT \\"When Love is Gone\\" (naturally in widescreen)<br />(b) First VHS release in PAN & SCAN and WITH \\"When Love is Gone\\"<br />(c) The Laserdisc release which is COMPLETE because it is BOTH in widescreen and includes \\"When Love is Gone\\"<br />(d) The first US DVD release in PAN & Scan and WITH \\"When Love is Gone\\"<br />(e) The first UK DVD release in PAN & SCAN and WITHOUT \\"When Love is Gone\\"<br />(f) The second US DVD release, which includes \\"b\\" and \\"d\\" above plus \\"a\\" above<br />(g) The first Blu-Ray release that (apparently) includes only \\"a\\" aboveScan from the earlier release PLUS a nice widescreen version THAT DID NOT INCLUDE \\"WHEN LOVE IS GONE\\"!

B007FEFLTO|5.0|entertaining and so easy to read. easy to follow that one want more to happen ans hopefully there will be a item 3
B0098VYCCE|1.0|Dull and uninspiring - the only good thing was that I didn't see it in the movie theaters and could fastforward through the really painfully bad moments (there were quite a few of those).  You are better off watching Stardust or Enchanted ... movies which have much better storylines and above all acting.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|very easy to see and use. The screen is huge and colorful which makes it fun to use. I definently recomend this calculator for all ages it is the best calculator ever.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Theirs not much more that can be said about Disney/Marvels the avengers so I'm digging straight into a review of this film in 3D.<br />The verdict.................... Absolutely amazing. The 3D conversion is worthy of much praise and looks noticeably better than the two times I saw it in the theater. The final fight scene in the middle of new york city is simply stunning. The film has a few great pop out scenes but the real highlights of the films 3D release is Iron Man flying high through the city and The Hulk lunging towards the screen before destroying a fighter jet. If you have the chance to experience this movie in the comforts of your own home in the 3D than I would say this film is a must have just to showcase how well a movie can look in home 3D.<br /><br />So you might be asking next,is their any cons to Avengers 3D?<br /><br />Very minimal. The biggest thing I noticed is that if I'm skipping between scenes than it will take the disc a second before readjusting to 3D. The only other 3D film I'v noticed to do this was Ghost of the Abyss 3D.<br />The only of other point of contention I noticed was when Loki is looked in the small prison created for the Hulk. While talking to the Black Widow the spit from his mouth is very noticeable in 3D. Drooling down the the side of the screen. But once they cut back to him,the spits magically gone.<br /><br />Final verdict: Worth every dollar.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I keep rereading this series. I feel in love with it. When this author makes a fourth book for this series (which I hope happens) I will most certainly buy it the first day it hits the shelf.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have always like pride and prejudice so much with Kira Knitley. She has played this role to perfection in my estimation. I did see another one at Walmart for $5.00. But that was ok with what you sent me.Thank you so much.<br /><br />Susan Rodgerson
0316228532|4.0|In ordering Casual Vacancy I wanted first to get the book quickly and with little hassle through Amazon and then to find it lived up to the hype as a worthwhile read that didn't try to fly on Harry Potter's broomstick.  The service was a tad better than the book, but both lived up to expectations.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the second Nicholas Sparks book I have read (The Rescue is the other). This book was Sleeping with the Enemy-esque. It was very well written and kept me captivated and wondering how it would all turn out. Now I am ready to see the movie in February. It has been awhile since I found a book I couldn't put down.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Ah. Well... I attended Juilliard... I'm a graduate of the Harvard business school. I travel quite extensively. I lived through the Black Plague and had a pretty good time during that. I've seen the EXORCIST ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVEN TIMES, AND IT KEEPS GETTING FUNNIER EVERY SINGLE TIME I SEE IT... NOT TO MENTION THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING TO A DEAD GUY.
1572707208|2.0|Very disappointed in the non-ability to hear the audio version I purchased. Tried it in two vehicles and the same result. Volume turned up all the way was difficult to hear while traveling. I now will have to schedule it when I have total quiet time outside of driving. Hard to understand why this was done.

B00914JWSW|5.0|Product arrived on time and in good condition.  This CD is very entertaining, as many of the songs I'd not heard before.  Interesting to follow the changes in Barbara's presentation as the years have gone by.  What a great entertainer and personality.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|a bit gory. certainly exciting.<br />I wonder if i can switch left and right hands?<br />lacks characters and story line, so far.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Product arrived on time and in good condition.  This CD shows some previously not heard/seen musical talent and diversity by Diana Krall.  You will certainly enjoy this musical adventure.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you like super hero movies with a ton of action, world destroying nemesis, and fun jokes... You will love this movie too!!<br />It pokes irreverent fun at the superheroes, you laugh at them, then with them!! It's fantastic!<br />The \\" this idiot is giving me all\\" in the interrogation scene? Priceless! The \\"suit up\\" iron man... Then.. \\"No, really--suit up!!\\" ...<br />The \\"millionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist \\" line, another classic-- and the Hulk and Loki's thrashing? Absolutely Hilarious!! The Director and the writers are geniuses...<br />Get it!

B009PJA8XG|5.0|absolutely funny. They make being a nerd cool. If your not watching it then you aren't cool enough to be a nerd.
B007UPNA6Y|2.0|As a confirmed Jack Reacher fan, I found this book to be a disappointment.  The story meandered along.  It felt at times that the author wanted to end it but the story was too short, so further bits were added for the just to get a required number of words.  Still , I am prepared to allow Mr Child this one disappointment after all the other good times I have had with this character.  Let's hope it is just a small hiccup - or has Jack Reacher reached the end of his journey?
B008N1V11U|4.0|This game was worth it; the only down fall with this game is the missions get a bit repetitive but fun
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Vert good book about Navy Seals and the life of Adam brown.  He was a drug user who reformed to become a Seal.  Well written, but tragic story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like temple run GET this it is just like it but way more entertaining and better with trains rushing and so much like temple run but better!
1591843162|3.0|This book is written in a style that consists mainly of quick bursts of information around one topic, then skip to another, then skip to another. Most all of the information revolves around the central theme of being more than an anonymous worker, instead being a value added contributor to your organization. If you are more accustomed to chapters, rather than passages, then this may be a different reading experience for you. Either way, the message is good but a little over-baked.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is really good but I would recommend subway surfer... much more fun and also more entertaining with way better courses!
B008KE3960|5.0|This is an excellent game. It's rather challenging after only a couple of levels. If you're looking for something that'll cause you to be late for school or work, this is what you're looking for.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is one of the grates invented and i love to bilding them and i love playing with my friends.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|It's a matter of taste for sure, but I missed this series because we don't have cable.<br />This lets us enjoy it anyhow. We love it.
0385344333|3.0|The first part of this most recent book was good but the last part to the ending was quite boring.  All of the hullabaloo about the storage facility for military trucks and equipment was a real let down after the first part of the book.  I was very disappointed.  Apparently Mr. Child is good at writing a great story but at a certain point does not know how to finish it on as high note. I lost count of the number of people Reacher killed in that storage facility!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works well on the Kindle Fire HD, this is the classic game that has dominated computers and is the cause of procrastination in users everywhere! :)
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Wonderful book. I could imagine every tent, every character, every costume. I truly enjoyed this! It really came to life for me. Thank you.
B00628RVV0|4.0|Just echoing the sentiments of everyone else: it's a thought-provoking and emotional film, but not in the slightest historically accurate. Critics say that its fairytale plot over-simplifies/trivializes/commercially exploits the Holocaust; and that by allowing impossible events to take place or glossing over critical facts, less informed audiences might assume concentration camps weren't nearly as bad as they are.<br /><br />Although I think the latter is an especially dangerous line to cross, I defend the film for what it is--the narrative of a sheltered boy. His innocence isn't meant to symbolize/defend people who pretend they didn't know what was happening at the time--his misinformation is just that of a child whose mother attempts to conceal the truth. After all, the movie is MEANT to exist through the naivete of a child's world.<br /><br />If you want accuracy, go read a memoir instead of a fantastical distortion written in a few days by an author with no connection to the Holocaust--if you think the subject is too grim for fairytales, this might upset you. If you want tweens to understand that time period, I would rather recommend \\"I Have Lived A Thousand Years\\"; this isn't the type of movie to learn from. Otherwise, \\"The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas\\" is a must-watch emotional 'what-if' historical fiction with superb acting and character development.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All three books in The Hunger Games series are fantastic and I'd highly recommend them. I was disappointed that there weren't more and I look forward to trying more Suzanne Collins books!
B008OOYALE|5.0|even more awesome then I said earlier<br /> I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I love love love love love it
B008OOYALE|5.0|I used to have issues with this game when playing it on my phone, but the problems are solved on the Kindle Fire.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was the perfect way to contnue the series Annabeth's quest was very interesting and I hope to read the House of Hades very soon.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great movie, can't wait til the sequel!  If the next movie is going to be as action packed as this one, it is going to be another top seller.  Always a great experience dealing with Amazon.
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I didn't watch the series this is based on and didn't know much about it except what I saw in commercials.  The commercials make it seem like a dark comedy but I found the comedy lacking.  The acting was blah, the plot was blah, the movie was boring.  It takes a long time to build to the climax and it falls short. I'll pass on this if it comes to TV.
0345803485|1.0|^^^^Refer to title of this review.^^^^<br />This book isn't even worthy of the 1 star I gave it. It isn't even worthy of a proper review.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I found this movie as eery as the others in the series.  Yes as I scientist a lot of it is either far-fetched or not what a real scientist would do but it is a movie.  Just like in horror movies when the girl investigates the dark by herself (which should not happen in real life), in this movie the characters do stuff real scientists wouldn't do but who cares?  This movie is freaky and beautiful at the same time.  The lighting and music/sounds heighten the experience.  Michael Fassbender plays a great cyborg/robot.  Most of the time you can see what is coming but you want to watch anyway.  That's a great movie.  You'll be rooting for the humans but you may appreciate the bad guys too.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I found reading lots of the reviews that a lot of people didn't like the ending. I did. Stiefvater tied up all the loose ends with Grace and Sam. She did leave a few openings with Cole and Isabel, but there relationship was never the focus of the books. Additionally the story ends where it began- the exact same spot in the woods. It was a nice touch and you left the series feeling satisfied that everything was nice and orderly. I personally like the open ending feeling of the book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I have this game on my computer and I love it I want to get it on my kindle. but I have one question are the levels the same as the computer?
B0084I9QIW|3.0|Michael just blows his audience away with his performance. The problem...if any...with this concert dvd is the quality. It is not a bad job on any body's part, it is simply from 1988! The technology simply did not exist back then to make this performance all that it could be. Michael's performance however, it is GREAT and deserves 5 stars.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love that I can choose from my songs and that the alarm starts quiet and increases in volume.  No obnoxious blare.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Masterfully produced, Oracular Spectacular seems to resemble some kind of audible, dopamine releasing drug, while simultaneously hitting the listener with a strong dose of subliminal cosmic wisdom.  MGMT manages to evoke sounds from some kind of higher, future universe where everything glows and sings.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is the best game ever because I said it is. The only bad thing about is that you have to have Internet access to play
B00008972S|4.0|Overall, I was satisfied with my purchase. The DVD was not scratched and didn't skip or freeze as I watched the movie. However, the description said that there would be minor wear and tear etc on the outer case and that is quite an understatement. Each item in the case (the box, booklet, and each DVD) had a person's name written across it in black Sharpie. They had attempted to remove the writing but besides being slightly faded, it was still very noticeable. Since this did not affect the DVD's ability to play, I did not return it. When I purchase something online, I read the description carefully to decide whether or not it is worth the price, and if I had known that there would be writing across every item in the DVD case, I probably would not have purchased the item.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  If you liked The Help, you will love this book.  It is well written.  Two of the main characters tell the story.  I highly recommend this book.  You will laugh and you might shed a tear, but you will enjoy the book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book does an excellent job playing into the emotions one would feel in the different situations and packs in a lot of pulse-pounding excitement.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazingly well written...drawn in from the very beginning and couldn't put it down. Recommend this for any age group that can read.
B000VWSI8S|5.0|This is a lovely album.  These two masters play very well together.  This is what Jazz is all about.  Enjoy!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have found this app to be very helpful and very accurate. It is far better than many other apps that cost money. I would recamend this app to everyone.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This is a must read for anyone who has a dog or who is an animal lover. Heartwarming story, very believable and a reminder of just how loyal and lovable our furry companions are.
B001BKTEZA|4.0|This classic still gets it done. Henry Fonda is excellent in the starring role and the supporting cast turns in excellent performances as well.<br />The steady erosion of the present-day middle class and the emergence of an increasingly arrogant and greedy plutocracy only increases the film' currency.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I highly recommend this book. It's a quick and easy read, a page turner that you can't put down. A number of fellow readers I spoke to seemed to have mixed feelings about the ending, but I wouldn't dare spoil it. Would be a great book club discussion!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|While a lot of the puzzles were challenging, the pop up ads after completing the puzzles were annoying.  I also prefer games that don't have an end.  This game ends after a series of four levels.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun good variety the ads get to be a bit much<br />would be nicer if you could unlock the other games in other ways.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I really love this game but found it frustrating when at level 80 or so it reset to start again. we'll see if it happens again when I get that high again.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I love this album from start to finish. The upright bass really adds a good foundation and she's a beautiful singer.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The game keeps you busy when you need to pass time. the game was very entertaining. If you like hidden object games with a good story behind them I recommend this game!
B00881VLCE|5.0|Awesome old fashioned jigsaw puzzle game! love it! Extensive library of both free &amp; priced puzzle packs. Great game! Can't put it down!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Was a great flick<br /><br />Would recommend it to any superhero fan. Had a little something for everyone...appeals to all audiences
B000HF6XKO|5.0|that go and kill all the stupid people, terrorists and poor people in other places, since USA is so great and no one else is. Really, that is main idea behind so many movies, that the theme, \\" The USA is most intelligent, best run and the only country where people are right,\\" is so sickening. Surpising too, as this movie is not new.
B004S5C91Q|4.0|Room was an excellently written book, based somewhat loosely on an abduction case in the US a few years' back.  The detail and Author's imagination of the Room was brilliant. Couldn't put it down.  I am hoping to read other books by Emma Donaghue. I purchased from Amazon to my Kindle.
1423140605|5.0|Book arrived on time and my family enjoyed the reading.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has children that love to read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|a good way to waste of time! I highly recommend that you try this game if you are bored and don't watch a lot of television.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Now finally the Kindle Fire gets Minecraft. The game will get better and cheaper as time goes on. Mojang updates about once a month with new features being added each update. Minecraft is a really great game and the game corralates well with the screen. The only possible bug is that when you have to jump, Minecraft doesn't have the best system. However it is a great game that may even bring back memories of the 8-bit years but with 3-D Models. Have a great time playing one of the nations most played games, Minecraft.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Love this book the second in the series! Has a great story with twists and turns! I am awaiting num three so I can continue on the journey! If you like the Greys trilogy u will love this even more!
B008V4H60E|5.0|Flying Lotus' Until The Quiet Comes is a fantastic work.  It brings together the best parts of Los Angeles and the best parts of Cosmogramma, while at the same time creating a new face of Flying Lotus and a brand new sound.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />However, go buy it somewhere else.  I bought this album from Amazon, and when I received it, huge scratches on All In, Sultan's Request, and The Nightcaller - each the first track of their respective sides - made it almost impossible to appreciate this album the way I should have.<br /><br />So, naturally, I return the album... and Amazon sent me a new copy with scratches on the exact same tracks.<br />The problem seems to be with amazon's packaging of vinyl albums.  The box that holds the record contains two flaps that clamp the record down, to keep it from moving around during shipping.  These clamps are on incredibly tight both times - the record's edges were permanently compressed as a result.  I think that this packaging method also compressed the vinyl itself, causing the grooves in the first tracks of each disk to be malformed and easily skipped out of.<br /><br />So, in closing - beautiful album, but buy it from someplace that actually cares about shipping music, like Insound or Bleep.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an awesome enstallment to the series. The plot definitely left you on the edge of your seat. As always Percabeth was my favorite couple with lots of cute moments:). Leo also was really developed as a character and shined in this book. Also it's great to see things from Annabeth's point of view! The ending leaves me hungry for the next one!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great follow up to the first book. Can not wait for the third book! This series is so freakin  addictive.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I'm a big fan of the original Alien movies (up until about number 4) and was kind of excited to discover some new information about the origin of the creature, some back story, etc. . .I figured Mr Scott, of all people, would be the one to tell the story masterfully.  After having seen this turd of a flick, I wish they would have left the story well enough alone. My wonderings about the history of the alien were far more interesting than the plot of this overblown CGI - heavy, plot-light movie.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, the characters are complete idiots who insult the intelligence of the audience by posing as \\"scientists.\\" The \\"plot\\" is convoluted and really not very interesting.  Several times throughout the movie I found myself scratching my head and saying \\"huh?\\" If you're looking for an intelligent,engaging, believable sci fi flick, DON'T rent Prometheus. You're better off revisiting the first or second Alien movie, or even Blade Runner. Stay far far away. . . .
B006LSZECO|2.0|I had high hopes for this book, and for the first 25%  I thought it was going to be great.  The way she explored the dissolving relationship between Nick and Amy was fascinating and I thought it was going to develop into a smart, tightly wound, believable story.  Just reading about how bitter their relationship had become made it seem like, \\"Yes, this is something that could really happen.\\"  Other reviews keep talking about how the twists were so surprising, but I thought as the book went on, it became more and more unbelievable and predictable.  It went from being a psychological thriller exploring that dark side of intimacy to a really bad Lifetime movie.<br /><br />SPOILER: And the ending was TERRIBLE.  I don't need there to always be justice in the end and I understand ending a book so that it leaves you hanging, but this just kind of trailed off.  99% of the book was painstakingly detailed, and then the last 1% was rushed.  Like the author wanted to wrap up a few loose ends {when Nick tells Go and Boney about Amy's news} and then that's it.  The end.  Nothing else.  It was an ending so much as an abrupt stop.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this book. Based on some of the reviews I had read and heard from friends, I thought it was going to be a crime thriller that wasn't lowest common denominator.  It started out that way, but ended up being a disappointment.
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|I really like Steve Carell, and I tried to enjoy this, but I just couldn't get into it.  It lacks the clever multi-level humor I'm used to from the classic Pixar films like Toy Story and A Bugs Life.  I found myself becoming bored with the plot after about 30 minutes, and the characters weren't interesting enough to really grab me. It seems to be a hit with the kids - my girlfriend's 9 year old son enjoyed it, but I don't think it has enough substance to maintain an adult's interest.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|I enjoyed the book but wasnt as good as the first, but worth reading . In fact the first book The Hunger Games was a stand out.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I could not put this book down. Intriguing plot, engaging characters, unexpected twists. i'm looking forward to her next book.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Got to read them. I have never been that hooked up by any bok. . . . . . .
B000HEWEEY|5.0|Un must per tutti gli appassionati di fantascienza<br />Il DVD merita considerazione non solo per il film, che da solo é un capolavoro, ma anche per gli extra.<br />Il modellino di Robbie é incantevole<br />Da conservare nella vostra videoteca
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is very addicting.  You win some and you lose some. The game runs smoothly. No crashes or freezing. Very worthwhile downloading.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|\\"Jetpack Joyride is one of the best games I've played,\\" says my seven year old daughter.  She says it is one of her favorite games.  You can play this game hundreds of times and still be happy playing it.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|Directors Cut was great.  Brought back memories of when I first saw the movie.The movie was crystal Clear which made it more enjoyable to watch.
1469984202|5.0|I just finished this series and started looking for more books by this author!  What a great series that you simply can not put down -- sorry family!  Can't wait for hubby to finish reading it -- I am walking around with a grin on my face.  A sign of a truly great piece of art.
0142405809|5.0|My 4 year old son really loves this book.  We have a large book collection and he will pick this one out on his own and ask for it to be read.  It's a beautiful story of a little snail that wanted to travel the world and the whale that came by one day and let the snail ride on his tail.<br />They travel the world and the snail enjoys all the wonders while riding on the whale's tail.  But then the whale gets beached and the snail must help him.  A sweet story of friendship and there are so many parts of this book which show others taking care of one another.  A great lesson for small children to learn.  Endearing and an enjoyable read.  My 2 year old will also sit through the tale.  :)
B008I3R2VG|5.0|This is a great album, like always the killers put out an amazing record keeping on expanding their musical horizons
B005RAO0GS|5.0|This album is not quite as good as Lungs, but it's still amazing. I would highly recommend it for anyone who likes good music or strong female voices.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was skeptical to start reading these, but I'm so glad that I did! They were really good books, and I became addicted to them very quickly. I couldn't put them down.<br /><br />Also, at the end of this book, where they go through the first interview with Mr. Grey and Ana from Christian's perspective.... this was amazing!! I would love it if the author wrote these books again, but all in Christian's point of view. This short section was hilarious, and getting to visualize his frustrations and arguments within himself was worth it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What an incredible window into a genius that was completely nuts!  Walter Isaacson gave a great insight into the man and took us along the journey of the computer industry as it went from the hobbyist's den to every American home.  It was fascinating to read about Steve Jobs' intuitive understanding of where technology could lead, his difficult relationships with those close to him, and even his unusual dietary habits, such as the time he told his mother, \\"I'm a fruitarian and I will only eat leaves picked by virgins in the moonlight.\\"<br /><br />A few days after Jobs passed away, I wrote the following on my personal blog, \\"It was because he embraced his imperfections that he understood the imperfections in all of us. It was because he understood that we are imperfect beings that he sought to give us things we could understand (such as the point-and-click usability of the Mac) but knew where to draw the line when it crossed over into something we would never get (like the restriction on users accessing the operating system on a Mac).\\"<br /><br />Now I realize that while he was imperfect, he was relentless in demanding the closest to perfection that anyone could give.  He constantly challenged engineers to do things they thought impossible only to prove them wrong.  In a bizarre way, he became successful running antithesis to the Alcoholics Anonymous credo in that he couldn't accept the things he could not change, he was belligerent in changing the things he could change, and he didn't have the wisdom to know the difference.<br /><br />He was an incredibly complex man and I feel like I learned something about people and about myself having read this biography about him.
B008NW67E0|3.0|TRUTH IS, it doesn't matter what I say about this album.  If you have been waiting as long as I have for M&S to put out this album, you are going to buy it no matter what anyone says and I don't blame you.  After all, I did.<br />  Yes, this album flows better with less wildly sporadic low to high volume exchanges as their first album(or maybe I am more used to their sometimes screaming approach) BUT However, I have to agree with another reviewer, it's noticeably more preachy and religious in nature.<br />  I wouldn't be surprised to hear this music on a Christian Music Station(not that I would ever listen to one.)  Van Morrison could make you feel spiritual without preaching but M&S are not as subtle, their songwriting is certainly more naive than the great bard.  [At times they remind me of my friend's band, Rusted Root. In the days of tapes this album would have been a great pairing with Rusted Root's first or second album on the other side.]<br />  There are parts that are interesting(and catchy) but also some chords and melodies that are redundant.  They lost some of their rough edge and some of their uniqueness, probably a result of more heavy-handed producing and editing. I do believe this album is music for the masses(and I mean both kinds.)  The mostly Christian, Country Music Loving, middle of this country has just been invited to the Mumford and Sons Party... and unfortunately, unless you live on the coast, that is the new mainstream.
141694737X|5.0|Cute story and unlike many of the books made this way, these flaps are really durable! My grandson and his mother loved it!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Lived up to the Billing....great album... incredible album they did a fantastic job.... look forward the pending tour.... monster rocks!
B001FB4W0W|4.0|A Japanese company has invented a blood substitute called True Blood, originally meant for humans during surgery, it becomes the drink of vampires.  Yes, vampires are real in this story and have been inhabiting Louisiana for hundreds of years, unbeknownst to the human population.  Now as they can portray themselves as non-threatening to humans, they have decided to mainstream into human society and are demanding equal rights.  Enter a vampire named Bill who purchases a house on Bon Temps, LA.  The same house he lived in during the civil war when he was alive.  A waitress named Sookie serves him True Blood at the local restaurant and it is True Love!  While the story is truly in the fantasy genre and doesn't get much respect, this series is very well made and very enjoyable.  Alan Ball of Six Feet Under fame developed the show and kept much of the same staff working on True Blood.  The actors are excellent and led by Anna Pacquin, the youngest person to win an acting Oscar.  The main story surrounding these two characters are the deaths of a series of women who have been having sexual relationships with vampires.  Sookie's brother, Jason who is very sexually active seems to have had relationships with all of them too.  Is it Jason who is killing the women?  Or are they vampires?  Along the way, we meet a group of interesting human characters and vampires.  This season tells a comprehensible story and well developed characters.  One could see it as totally silly or find more depth in this story than other more \\"serious\\" fare.  I really enjoyed the show and I found the extras insightful.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|I've read all of Grisham's books and I'd rate this one as one of the less memorable efforts. The first 2/3rd's  of the book is a great read but the ending is unfulfilling and even worse, uninteresting. Over the years I've noticed that poor endings have become a trademark of Grisham books. After enjoying his previous two books, I was hoping he was turning the corner and finally delivering good books start to finish but this one is definitely a step back.
0985081821|4.0|\\"This books' going to make you run into a corner and explore your dark side!\\" @itsablurbthing<br /><br />With Halloween only just passing, I thought it only fitting to review `The Forever Girl' by Rebecca Hamilton.<br /><br />Firstly, I've got to say, after reading the summary blurb for this book I was as excited as a child in a sweet shop and couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of the full version. Not least because of the fact that it was a paranormal fantasy type book but because the summary blurb was so well written that, like a fine red wine, it made me instantly want more!<br /><br />I'm also not ashamed to admit however, that I found myself being rather sceptical after finding out that this was Rebecca's debut book; I was hoping for genius but couldn't help fearing a train crash! I needn't have worried though as it only took half-way through the first chapter before I was suddenly hit with the realisation that this book was going to be as good as the feeling you get when you take that first big bite of chocolate after a stressful day at work!<br /><br />Writing Style<br /><br />I was instantly hooked and bowled over by the natural flow and sharpness of Rebecca's writing style and her story descriptors really made me feel as though I was being catapulted into the book to actually live out the story with Sophia as opposed to being just another observer. This aspect of Rebecca's writing really did take me by surprise as I always feel that some debut writers can go overboard with story descriptions and lose the reader in the depths of overzealous `scene setting', which is not at all evident in this book. Rebecca also has an uncanny way in which she uses the end of a chapter to hook the reader into the next chapter - as a reader I tend to book mark at the end of a chapter, however Rebecca's hook style renders you incapable to do such things!<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />The characters are realistic and true to their origins - Rebecca has really put in theeffort to research her work thoroughly and this really shows within her characters interactions, back stories and her knowledge of Wiccan. Sophia, the main character, is a character that has a real sense of depth and has that all important `longevity' aspect to her personality - which is so important for a book series (she also has a wicked sense of sarcasm, which instantly attracts the reader to her sense of self-worth).<br /><br />Story<br /><br />The story itself is fantastically played out and although, at times, the pace is slightly off key and slows down at points (especially at the beginning of the book), however the fact that this book has a well thought out twist and ending, means that it is certainly worth sticking with. And whilst I agree, in part, to some reviewers reference that this book resembles Twilight, I feel a shot of realism needs to injected here...yes Twilight is a massive franchise and with the last instalment bound for the cinemas very soon, it will, yet again be thrust into the heads and hearts of those that love it, which will mean, unfortunately that yet again books which involve vampires, hints of romance and basically anything that involves sucking a large amount of blood from someone will be stigmatised!<br /><br />However that being said and even though I am a huge Twilight fan myself (and yes some men are, so don't knock it - I will still remain at the edge of my cave at night letting out my huge roar whilst beating my chest in a manly manner!), Rebecca has taken a concept, made it her own and build it to a heightened level of Paranormal sophistication.<br /><br />All in all I would highly recommend this book and will definitely be the first in line when the next one comes out!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Very entertaining and challenging.....I enjoy playing every chance I get  love the journey through the levels.  Enjoy that my grandchildren love it as well.
B0001VV1GK|3.0|We were looking for a garage for our large collection of toy cars. This is a well made, sturdy product with a little car wash and an elevator. It even comes with one vehicle. Strangely, the kids didn't really use it. It is pretty pricey and didn't get much use. If you know your child will use it and enjoy it, then worth the investment for the quality. However, it just wasn't a hit for us.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldnt put it down - very enjoyable to read while traveling - the ending<br />got a bit contrived but all in all I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I recommend it because it is user friendly,  plus has a good choice of different Bible versions. Some have readback option.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I loveeeee this book!!!  Its a very good book that I have read. Love it! You need to read this!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|its fun to play when I'm bored. ads aren't a problem.. just wish it was more customizeable and more Colorado
1416550534|5.0|I began reading this book while I was watching the entire series the of BBC Upstairs Downstairs.  To my delight it was similar in the general sense of the maid keeps secrets for the sisters out of empathy.<br /><br />The author's details to the house description via the filmmaker's set design are excellent.  The mother-daughter character contrast of Grace and Ruth, felt very close to home for me.  So it might not be a stretch for me to say that this book was a great place for me to escape, while my own mother and I were finding ourselves coping with our personality differences while she was dying.<br /><br />If you love old mansions, a Great Gatsby type of mood & great character development ... This book is for you!<br /><br />Oh, and a mystery with a TWIST!  This author has the best TWISTs!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a fast-paced addition to the Heroes of Olympus series. It includes 4 perspectives, including one from Annabeth for the first time. I cannot wait until the next installment arrives next year!
B000F8O4E0|4.0|While there's only eight songs in the original release format, they are all very good.  This is a case where the non-hits are the real gems - Poker rocks, Down Home Town is a funny take on the southern US from a Brit's perspective, and the lush One Summer Dream wraps up the package nicely.  I had a chance to see them perform some of this material live in a small theater in Chicago and it was one of the best rock shows I ever saw.  They were having a great time performing and it showed.  Later I saw them in a large arena during the \\"Out of the Blue flying saucer\\" tour and it wasn't quite the same at all.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Julia Roberts, Lily Collins, Armie Hammer, Nathan Lane, Sean Bean work extremely well in this movie.  It is funny threw out the movie and gives you a new look at Snow White.  Great movie!!!
B008OOYALE|5.0|very fun game. especially if you love dragons. tons of different dragons. you can breed, grow,care for and evolve them into different forms.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|TTSS is truely one of the best spy thrillers in cinema history. Gary Oldman's performance is quietly intense. Colin Firth's character depicts the darker side of having a \\"licence to kill\\", a very sobering \\"OO\\" agent. A must see for anyone who grew up during the cold war.
B00975L81Y|5.0|First of all, people should stop expecting bands to go back to their early sounds all the time. Get real!!! CoF can probably never re-create \\"Principles of evil made flesh\\" or \\"Dusk and her embrace\\". Every band's music music evolves and sometimes compromises need to be made and musical directions need to be shifted a bit to prevent redundancy. Megadeth can never re-create 'Rust in peace' but 'Endgame' was nevertheless equally powerful yet contemporary for the times. Similarly, CoF's deviation from their trademark sound since Nymphetamine is certainly not seen in this album. This is more like their early stuff, although more contemporary, as I would like to call it. I feel this a landmark album for CoF and would be a reference for good black metal records in the future. There is definitely a lot of variety in the album, starting and ending with instrumentals (special mention about Sinfonia, which is awesome!). While 'Illicitus, Manticore, frost on her pillow, huge onyx wings reflect classic CoF, tracks like For your vulgar delectation and succumb to this are more mainstream. I respect their experimentation with their sound, while still staying heavy. This is the secret of success for this band that has survived through the decades to become the biggest band next to Maiden to come out of UK. Personally, I feel CoF is only going to get better. THE HORROR WILL LIVE ON!!
1423140605|5.0|This was the best book I read this year.<br />Go, Rick Riordan, go!<br />Go, demigods, go!<br />This universe really rules.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Where to start...  I really wanted to like this book.  I wanted to be engrossed in the mystery & at first I was...in fact, even with the very off-putting profanity & vulgarity I stuck with it all the way through because I wanted to see how it would end...but the ending was awful.  A previous reviewer nailed it.  It's like the author couldn't find a crafty way to tie it all together & bring justice in the end.  So she just quit.  It was flat, anti-climatic, and a real disappointment.  I do NOT feel like the characters were developed in a believable way and neither of them were ever likable...even early on in Amy's diary.  And honestly, I found it quite predictable.  It just didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />The good news is that is was a fast, easy read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This is a much better story than I thought it would be. I had heard that it was aimed at the junior high-high school crowd and didn't think it would interest me. I generally like the spy novel/detective/action type but there was enough of that in this book to keep me reading.  There is a reason why they made it a movie; find out for yourself! Download the Kindle version and be reading in no time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was an awesome book! I loved the suspense and it kept me reading! I'm really excited to read Mocking jay!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Awesome game. One time when I went to play, after playing another game all my progress was gone. Other than that, this game is the best game Rovio has come up with so far
B005LAIHR2|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Yes, the storyline was cheesy and very basic as most musicals tend to be. But the cast do a great job with their individual caricatures of the various roles they each play. Tom Cruise, especially surprised me. His tongue-in-cheek impression of the egomaniac lead singer was hilarious and was worth the money itself.<br /><br />Alec Baldwin, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Malin Akerman all do great caricatures of their various roles.<br /><br />Enjoyed the music, particularly the Foreigner numbers. Some were a bit corny but \\"Hit me with Your Best' by Zeta-Jones and the \\"Juke Box Hero/I Love RocknRoll\\" medley were highlights.<br /><br />Julianne Hough was a surprise. A dancing Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />If you like musicals and especially if you like 80s soft rock, then you'll enjoy this movie for sheer entertainment value.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|My children saw this film in the theatre and then I kept renting it from RedBox.  Finally after about $5 in rentals I decided to buy the video.  We are so happy to own it!! Also, the shipping was quick and we are very satisfied.
B003L77G38|5.0|I've been a Fringe fan since Day one, and Season Three was the best yet. I'm so sorry this has to be the last season.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|This was Grisham at his worst. I bought this because one of the previous reviews said it was like the Grisham of old. It was awful. The plot was so unbelievable, it was insulting to read. I kept checking to make sure this was really written by John Grisham.  The main character displayed an arrogance and his plan for revenge was childlike in theme, had no logic nor basis in fact or possibility. All in all, I would like to get back not only the money I paid for this but the time I wasted reading it.  I find it still annoying just thinking about it.
1451608659|5.0|I could not put this book down! I have been a huge fan of Dominique since I was a little girl and I still am! Very good book!! I now have all 3 of her books! It's a must read :)
0553582461|3.0|I was engrossed in the Fitz series . . . with the carefully detailed and crafted characters and setting. I totally bought in to it, which, of course, is why I read fantasy fiction. When I was about 2/3 way through Fool's Fate, I looked at the 1/3 inch of pages left, and thought \\"how is she ever going to resolve everything in such little space?\\" Basically, she didn't. Fitz with Molly and not the Fool? How about Kettricken .  .  . I was expecting that maybe Web would end up as a \\"close advisor\\" or something. Also left blowing in the breeze, without closure: Nettle, Thick, Chade . . . on and on. I have read that Robin Hobb's deadline was tightened on this book, and I sympathize, but still . . . the ending of an otherwise entrancing series seemed extremely rushed, almost as if someone else had written it, following a tic list. Might there be another book in the series? Or might she sneak some pithy details on these northern characters into the newest Rainwilds book? I am rarely as upset by a book, with the final book in DG's Outlander series being a close second.<br />Daleanna
B00846REIS|3.0|I much preferred shades of grey. Maybe because I had read the latter I expected more in this novel. It was ok but not enough to warrant the reading of her other novels
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love this app-&amp; I use it everyday! I love how it has the reading plan catagories. It also is nice that it is free! :)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|This was my favorite app until I updated it. Used to work great! Now it freezes up on me after 1 minute of playing. Needs a fix!!! I won't waste my time trying to play this!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game because I get live a story most ppl who luv dragons wuld want. This really is THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book primarily because the author took the time to explain in detail what occured and then reviewed the process clinically. While the conclusion of the experience may be up for debate by some, I will lean towards the author's explanation until someone can offer a more viable explanation that hasn't yet been researched. The book does leave one wanting more follow-up details and updates.
1451695195|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book after reading the Newsweek cover article about it and ended up disappointed. Perhaps this book will be interesting to people unfamiliar with religion, spirituality, and life after death experiences but for anyone who's read about these topics elsewhere - there's nothing new, profound or thought-provoking contained within. The author describes his experience in the Core, the Gateway and the realm of the earthworm's eye view but he does not give over any of the answers or knowledge he gained while traveling through these places. This book does not provide answers to questions like \\"What are we doing here?\\" \\"What's my purpose?\\" \\"How long will the Earth and humankind's journey last?\\" \\"Will we live to see a time of Divine intervention on a global scale?\\" The only lesson learned is that the Creator loves us; I was hoping for more details. The book may be a starting point for scientifically-minded skeptics but it is NOT written for spiritual seekers. It does sound like a valid experience written by a previous skeptic, however.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was a lot of fun.  Well worth the money.  Looking forward to the next one!  If you like these kinds of games, you'll enjoy this one.
B000FCKBCU|5.0|A modern love story with a lot going on. Interesting live change desitions. Fun and easy to read, great for your vacation's time
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I like monster life because u can make your monsters and teach them how to fight<br />I like that you can get all different kinds of monsters and feed them wash them and play with the monsters
B007MJSYF0|1.0|Whether it was the inspiration for 'The Hunger Games' or not, this movie is laaaaaame. No character development, horrible, stupid dialog (\\"I always thought you were cute\\" - \\"You never said anything!\\" - after shooting her male schoolmate...), just 2 hours of kids killing each other. I think I liked Hunger Games more than others did because I read the book first, but that aside, this was the worst $5 I ever spent. Quentin thinks this is his \\"favorite\\" movie?
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|The Avengers movie is a lot of fun, full of action and great acting and cool superheroes. The only complaint I have is the set of special features. No real behind the scenes footage. Nothing relating to building sets, designing costumes, special effects, sound effects and music. What it does have is a funny (but short) gag reel, and a somewhat interesting feature where the main actors talk about themselves and segue into the next actor by mentioning them. There are some interesting deleted scenes. I love special features, and this movie could have had hours of them with it's scope. I hope it's not a marketing thing where next year they'll come out with another release which will have all the cool special features!
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I think CRUISE portrayed a perfect drug addict and he showed a true 80's rocker! I thought it was funny and light hearted like A MUSICAL SHOULD BE .....
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a wonderful continuation to the first book. I love that there was no gap between the two it made for a much smoother read.
3442217784|5.0|[[ASIN:B005TOCOEW How to be an Affiliate-with Clickbank!]]I bought this book years ago and  I just cant stop applying it to my daily life! For example Im always now thinking what smart way to do x thing or what other passive income can I find or do to have multiple income streams. Right now I have two passive incomes thanks to this book. An mlm, selling my ebook and selling copies of my art works. If it werent for this book I would have just thought of working my whole life from 8am to 5 pm until 65 or 70! Now I have other plans and goals and that is to as I mentioned to have multiple passive incomes. If you really want to learn how to be a millionaire one day and have the time to enjoy life, this is the book you should start reading!
1932735410|5.0|I passed PMP exam last month and this book was a major contributor to my success. I am very glad that I did not start reading PMBOK guide before reading this book. PMBOK guide provides all information but doesn't explain anything, and this is where this book comes in picture. The book is primarily focused on passing the PMP exam. But at the same time, it does an extremely good job of explaining all the processes and relating them to real world examples. Some people may not like a bit aggressive tone but personally I was perfectly OK with it. I read PMBOK guide after I was done reading this book twice and then PMBOK guide made sense. But without reading this book, PMBOK wouldn't have been any useful to me. I did not read any other book for exam preparation. I strongly recommend this book for doing PMP exam preparation.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Movie never gets old. Behind the scene and deleted scene.This is a must own for all superhero fans. This is a must own period!
B00526ZKYS|5.0|This book was recommended to me based on my previous reads from Amazon (Hunger Games, Divergent, etc), and after reading some of the reviews I was conflicted at purchasing it.  However, I ended up buying it and reading it in a week.  I probably have to agree with many reviews that the story goes through a very intricate and secretive love story and less of a physical battle with the dystopian society, however the main character has an intense internal battle with the society and expectations.  The writing is phenomenal and Lauren Oliver does an amazing and unparalleled job of describing situations and visual scenes, so much so that I would have to reread several passages because they were so epic. Some other people have made comments describing the reasons that they didn't like certain parts of the read and I agree with many, but it did not ruin the read for me. In the end, I could not put the book down, so in my mind the writing and the story were very successful and I have already bought the next installment in the series!  Can't wait! Read this!!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The second book is an emotional roller coaster. I loved every minute of it. I can't wait for the third book. I'm very disappointed I have to wait so long for it to come out.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is one of my favorite TV shows and this completes the seasons for my household  -  I've watched all four several times.  The seasons seem to get better and better  -  love the romance, humor and action!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|I'm an occasional fan of Bob Dylan and have only a few of his albums.  But Tempest is my new favorite.  From the first song, Duequene Whistle, a great melody with a unique train rythem takes you to the end.  Each time I  listen to in I take something different from it.  Different messages about life come out.  [[ASIN:B0094U0RJQ Tempest]] Looking forward to the tour.
B003UYUP58|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good read which makes you learn something.<br /><br />There are a lot of fascinating stories about the history of our understanding of this disease.<br /><br />The book as at its best when it describes the times when our understanding of cancer was very limited or just wrong; when the search for cures was merely trial and a lot of error.<br /><br />However, I was not as enthusiastic about the more recent descriptions of cancer research, and in particular about the genetics of cancer. I found myself asking a lot of questions. For example:<br /><br />- I understand some cancers 'require' mutations in several genes. Do you just need bad luck to get such combination of mutations? Or are there mechanisms that make it more likely that certain patterns of mutations occur simultaneously? The discussion about 'pathways' was mostly beyond me.<br />- Angiogenesis sounds really fascinating, but the book does not give a lot of details about the extent to which tumours sometimes set up new blood channels.<br />- The section on smoking was good, and there is also something about asbestos, cell phone use, etc... However, even more detail about the studies on environmental factors would have been welcome.<br />- etc

B000000H5K|5.0|Roots Bloody Roots is among the best songs of all time in heavy metal, no questions asked.  This album helped shape metal for today's bands.  Yeah, they had a couple others that would help redefine and reshape metal, but Roots is a defining moment for metal.  Whether you like the album or not, you have to respect the influence this album had.  Max Cavalera is among the most talented and gifted metal musicians of our time and probably of all time.  Sepultura is not remotely the same without him and have sucked major time without him.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app allows you to find those great ideas you're looking for and keep them all in one place. I love being able to browse and see what my friends are into too! Great for gift ideas and crafts... also a virutal cookbook with any recipe under the sun!
030759565X|5.0|This is my first book purchase in ages and after spending all of yesterday reading it cover to cover like a novel I have to say it was a wonderful investment.  I am a regular follower of the SK blog and all of my friends and family know when it is a SK recipe.  Deb always sheds light on the logic behind attempting a new recipe or why she has a new go-to for xyz and why you should too.  I love that the cookbook has a photo for every single recipe (there are a few that require flipping back to a previous page that serves as a chapter intro but there is still a gorgeous photo of the final product.)  I thoroughly enjoy the bloglike intro before each recipe.  I find her antidotes charming and a wonderful addition to setting up the reason you need to get to your kitchen and bake/cook IMMEDIATELY.  I have already gifted a number of her cookbooks through the pre-order but believe it is appealing to anyone who enjoys cooking and sharing beautiful recipes that people will remember and request again and again.  I can see this being a signature gift for bridal showers, new homeowners, holidays, and birthdays.  Even though I often print out my favorite recipes from the web there are so many recipes in this book I can see becoming a part of my daily repertoire that I am thrilled to have it in book form.  And if the recent power outage from Hurricane Sandy has taught me anything it is that there is a definite benefit to having some things in tangible print.  You will not regret this purchase!
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Was looking for an easy to control dungeon game and this one fit the bill.  fantastic graphics, runs fairly well with minimal loss of framerate.  I lose control of the guy now and then but it doesn't ruin the experience.  Great addition to the games library on my Kindle.
1401937268|2.0|I've been reading and collecting tarot cards for over 25 years. Doreen Virtue is well known as an oracle deck maker and her artwork is sweet. I would never really use these as a serious reading deck because it's just sugarcoated tarot cards which to me obscure the intricacy of the ancient tarot. But the *worst* part of this deck is the cards are SO thick and SO huge that it's impossible to shuffle them. They're uncomfortable and akward to use and for the life of me I can't see who made the decision to make them like this. I mean I could use one as a frisbee it's so thick and hefty.<br /><br />So for a collection it's nice. If they were smaller I could see playing with them on occasion. As a serious reading deck? No dice.
B008D19WBQ|1.0|Unfortunately i will not be purchasing this Blu-ray box set now, or ever, Unless WB decides to publish ALL the episodes as they are on the DVD's.  This is a huge disappointment! I am really surprised that so much great footage has been cut from almost every episode, and what, they thought no one would notice?!?!???? I'll keep my DVD's! Thanks.

B007KOYEOC|5.0|Purchased from Amazon. Great story well written. Layout of the chapters is excellent.It has suspense, excitement all the other things in previous books. Would recommend this as a good read. I think its better than the other books. Can't wait for the next one.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Absolutely ADDICTING but I love it!!!! The app works great. Many times I lose time player! Thanks for a good time!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|The story line was OK,along with the acting. Tom Cruise was very good. The cast is excellant. The music is great and makes the movie worth watching.The vocals are amazing !I am glad I purchased it.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Recent interviews with the author in light of the movie launch made me (a decidedly not YA) read the book.  It's a first-person story, told through letters to someone whose identity is not revealed.  The narrator is a likeable nerd with more genuine issues than most nerds.  As befits a book allegedly written by a smart teenager, it's spotty.  The fatigue and constant social worries of high school are well documented, and those are ratcheted up intensely by Difference -- being gay, or sexually available, or being viewed a strident.  Though I enjoyed it, I never felt really close to the characters though.  They are all held at some distance, maybe so the narrator can examine them more closely.  Not all of their actions are consistent with what you might expect (though, teenagers man, that can happen), and I never really felt like all these characters lived.  In short, it's a little like reading the script to a John Hughes' movie.  Much to recommend it, but not exactly a great work of art.
B001A4LYN2|5.0|this movie is one of my favorites because it's storytelling at its simplest and its best. for the first 30 min or so there is no dialogue, which i didn't notice until i watched it for the third time, but the film and Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is so great that it doesn't even matter. If your looking for a lot of killing or if you like fast paced films then this one isn't for you. There Will Be Blood is for movie buffs who enjoy a wide range of genres and who are looking for a very interesting story about an oil man who is a little \\"off.\\" Daniel Day-Lewis gives another outstanding performance and I believe without him this film would be difficult to watch...but There Will Be Blood definitely delivers!!! ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES
B0087JTAKW|1.0|juvenile science fiction too implausible even for science fiction.  it is a very fast read and a couple of the chapters and, therefore, author's philosopy is thought provoking but, again, a little too simplistic for me
034580404X|5.0|The books were everything I thought they would be. Once you start reading them you cant put them down. Very good books, highly recommend them.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I as everyone else was looking for a filler book after reading 50 shades of grey. I found it. An amazing young fresh love story that is a great read for all ages of 17 and up. I love the banter of all the characters and the love hate relationships. Everything about this book was relateable. I can't wait to find a book as good as this one.
B00785P2QC|5.0|its a good easy game. no need to pay for money or anything. I leveled up pretty fast. its even a bit addicting. really fun
B0091REZMW|3.0|the game is fun but always asks me to redownload graphics. this game always keeps me entertained and is very fun.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|This CD has many songs on it not really played on the radio or presented on other CD mixes, really great to hear songs that are not so commercial and over played, it showcases the talent this man had, missed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This really is a good app. It has an alarm and and a timer sort of thing. It has never failed me in the mornings when I have to get up. It works great and is totally worth getting!

B008IGP8QE|5.0|My 15-month-old boy loves \\"Austin & Ally\\" and this cd has all songs from the show.  We just listen to it over and over every day, he doesn't stop dancing
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton has done it again! For anyone who has read her previous books and loved them as much as I did, this one won't disappoint. She has such a talent for creating these two distinct stories and intertwining them in amazing ways. I'm such a fan - please keep them coming, Kate!!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I do not like how the worlds are smaller and there isn't that munch seeds you could use. cant wait for the next update
0446572993|4.0|I just spent a month in France and I took along two books that I wanted to read. One was David Baldacci's THE INNOCENT. This was the first Baldacci novel that I have read and I found it good enough for me to begin reading his other works. I enjoyed his character development especially that of Will Robie and Julie, the fourteen year old. I did, however, find the story a bit convoluted and difficult to follow at times. I would give it four stars. And as I said, it did make me want to read more of his work.
B008RTE09S|4.0|I host a Beatles show here in Seattle every Sunday morning so of course I had to check out the TV show the boys made for The BBC to air in black and white on Boxing Day. While the actual show was pretty disjointed(pun intended) the music was fantastic. Giles Martin, son of Beatles producer George, did a bang up job remixing in 5.1 surround. I have a good laugh every time I watch the spaghetti scene and a sentimental feeling for The Fool On The Hill segment. The Bonus footage is great. While the story line or lack there of is weak, the music more than saves the day. John Paul George and Ringo looked like they were having fun and you will too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am enjoying my Bible from You Version. I recommend this app to friends and family..I especially love the daily devotional plans.
1451662432|5.0|What an Unbelievable Story.  I think that the best part is that you can tell that Arnold wrote this book himself. There is only one person that could say what he says.  You hear his voice in every word.
B009SSGBOE|5.0|I don't know what it is about Fagen or Steely Dan's music, but often it takes multiple listens to really appreciate it.  And that's the case with Sunken Condos.  On first listen to the samples, I was about ready to skip the album entirely.  I was concerned that Donald had maybe blown it this time.  The reviews on here didn't help--lots of mediocre ratings.  I was afraid that this album was going to be another Everything Must Go--perhaps the weakest album in the Fagen oeuvre.<br /><br />So I bought the Sunken Condos CD and went through it in full.  And my first reaction was--there was maybe one of two winners and the rest of the album was just OK.  \\"I'm Not The Same Without You\\" was a clear winner and the incredibly catchy and I.G.Y.-like \\"Miss Marlene\\" were awesome.  On listen six of the CD, I now think every song is very good and some are just wildly impressive and among Fagen's best.  The Issac Hayes klezmer-rific cover of \\"Out of the Ghetto\\" has a really stupendous backup harmony.  And \\"Weather in My Head\\" has a BB King bluesy vibe.  Both are stellar.<br /><br />Will Don get a grammy for this album?  Who cares!  Everyone knows that this music is far better than 95% of what is released these days.  If you are a mild fan of Don's other solo albums, you'll enjoy this CD.  If you are a bigger SD fan (at least from the mid-70s on), you'll really enjoy the album.  And if you are a big fan, you should have already bought this CD.  So why are you reading this anyways?  Buy the album already and enjoy some tremendous music.
B004GYY714|3.0|I purchased this app so that I could listen to my hometown basketball team (pre-season games) while visiting my mother on the other side of the country.  While it linked to the station back home, it didn't play the same programs.  I think the custom local feed, was not used in the link.  This was disappointing.  I ended up watching the play-by-play on NBA.com.<br />When Alaska had an earthquake that triggered tsunami warnings in Hawaii, I didn't find much here in the Hawaii listings.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great book. Kept me reading when I should be doing something else! Good suspense. Well written and would recommend it to others.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Ridley Scott's Prometheus is not a disappointment.  I really enjoyed the movie and found it to be entertaining.  Although it answedred a lot of questions from the \\"Alien Series\\" it did leave me with new questions.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a good app but updates required like sprinting, exploding TNT on creative, and creative mode sprinting.<br />Great App

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Run this on my Asus TF3003t android tablet.  It gives so much more info about battery than the included Asus battery info.  I use the verbal voice announcement on battery level, which is a great feature.  Set it when discharging at 25 and 10 percent.  Then when charging at 50, 75 and 95.  If you have it speak out at 100 percent, it keeps doing it so gets annoying,  Has nice graphics as well and shows digit of charged rate in addition to the verbal notice.  No ads either, at least that pop up and take over the screen.  I would highly recommend this app
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a very, very good book! I enjoyed it very much, never a boring moment and few surprises thrown in. Highly recomend it!
B002SSUQFG|5.0|So I've been wearing this for about a week now, and I am very impressed. I personally love the simple, non-flashy design - when my girlfriend first saw it, she begged me to let her wear it for the day :)<br /><br />The watch is definitely very accurate (maybe gained a few seconds this past week), perhaps even more accurate than the automatic Relic I own.<br /><br />In terms of comfort, I have to say it's amazing. I don't have very big hands, so the smaller size that others have mentioned is perfect for me. The strap did feel a bit uncomfortable in the beginning, but after a week of wearing it, I am already used to it, and doesn't bother me one bit. The watch is so lightweight and comfortable, that I actually keep it on at night.<br /><br />I can't comment on how sturdy or durable it is, as I always take it off while working out/etc.<br /><br />Definitely a great every day watch - I am more than happy I bought it!

0385535147|2.0|This is the worst Grisham ever. Half-way through the book, the protagonist is out of jail and in the witness protection program while the apparent murderer is indicted. I wondered, we're only halfway through, so far so good, now what? The protagonist inexplicably takes up with another ex-con, and their wild and unlikely adventures take up the rest of the book. I thought, I must have skipped a page where he explains the role of this other ex-con, but I couldnt' find such a page. At the end, at last, Grisham suddenly gushes up the backstory on the second ex-con. I don't mind a little fanciful adventuring but I don't like having the critical explanation dumped on me at the end of the story. It's cheating.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|4/3/13 revision based on several hours' use of the version 1.1.0 update for the KFHD7 (Max version of the program).<br />----------------<br />Both issues mentioned in my original review (see below) have been fully and elegantly addressed in the 1.1.0 update.  The program now asks at startup if you want to use Location Services.  If not, location defaults to either your previously entered latitude and longitude, or to that of a city that you have entered.  I use my own lat/long for accuracy.  Selector wheels for entering latitude and longitude have been redone.  They're easy to use and accurate.<br /><br />Zoomed in, the program shows positions of the major moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and of Jupiter's Great Red Spot.  If the positions are accurate, this program would be especially useful for observers with a telescope.  They seem to be close, but I haven't verified.<br /><br />Minor issue: Program launch dumped me back to the GUI (I use ADW) a couple of times but very rarely and not in any kind of pattern.  I have not seen the kind of problems described in Tim Hendon's review for version 1.09.<br /><br />This is a first class astronomy app for the KFHD. It shows you the sky around you, at any time and place, at the level of detail you specify.  Controls are intuitive, display is attractive, information is extensive.  This is the one to get.  Thanks, Mike - 5 stars.<br /><br />Original review dated 11/2/12:<br />-------------------------------<br />This otherwise excellent app has 2 unresolved issues on the KFHD:<br /><br />1) Location Services must be enabled before the app will run.  This is a nuisance and a waste of power unless you are away from known locations.  The app ignores its own Use Location Services (on/off)setting.<br /><br />2) When and Where Preferences allow you to set your longitude and latitude, or select a nearby city.  Selector wheels used for setting coordinates do not read out correctly.<br /><br />Developer Mike Smithwick responded quickly and positively to my emails and expects to fix the problems.  When the update comes out, this will be a 5-star app, even at its hefty price.  Until then, not recommended.d positively to my emails and expects to fix the problems.  When the update comes out, this will be a 5-star app, even at its hefty price.  Until then, not recommended.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie is well worth owning.  I will be looking for anymore of the sequels for this movies.  I am absolutely hooked.
B001J710Y8|1.0|Without a doubt this is the worst movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />Horrible story, pointless acting, a torture to watch.
B004GJXQ20|4.0|I didn't think I would be able to read this book to begin with as I found it very hard to get into; however after about 5 chapters and hard concentration I was loving it. I am looking forward to reading the second book in the series now.
B000URWYTS|3.0|This story starts out promisingly and slows down to a sonambulistic crawl. The writer is well spoken but dwells on minutia to the point of distraction. I could hardly wait to get it over and done.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I got this game and right away loved it! then it started ctashing my kindle making me restart it every two minuets I played without saving I can not get any were! App is a waist if money for some thing that does not evenwork.:(
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I got extremely tired of his constant off hand comments that take away from the narrative. I found myself skipping whole pages. It was cute for a few chapters, but got extremely tiresome. If all his books are like this I will not read another one.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started my workouts with this dvd back in february. It is now November, and i'm still doing Jillian! I lost all the 30 lbs though in the first 3 months. I ate right 80-90% of the time..had one cheat meal in one day per week. I did her workouts (one level for one month) and did 4-5 days a week. It paid off! I honestly didnt think it would've worked...I had NEVER had any success with weight loss, until I came across this dvd. This is the BEST AMAZON.COM Purchase i've ever made! The dvd wasnt expensive either! Now i'm doing her Ripped Dvd and i'm honestly in the best shape of my life! I didnt lose ALL of the baby flab though...still trying to work on that.<br />This is definitely a worthwhile purchase though! Its worth a shot for sure!
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Good ole fashioned Western at its good natured best.<br /><br />The camaraderie and chemistry between the actors off camera shows up in their characters on screen.<br /><br />They look like they having fun and enjoying working together in telling the story.<br /><br />I also love the warm tone colors in the cinematography. We've lost it in todays films which tend to be much bleaker and cooler tones. kind of depressing and dead to look at.<br /><br />I've seen this at the show as a kid and at least a dozen times more on TV....and plan to watch it again this Saturday morning with my GF ....in PJ's....with a good cup of hot Joe. YEAH!

B0086700CM|4.0|I like it. it passes the time. pluses its really addicting! the only thing I don't like is the fact that..... well come to think of it... I love it. not a negitive thing to say about this game.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|don't update I did this morning and all it does now is force closes aaaaalllllll the time. hate it now. :(
B000I9YX06|5.0|I started watching I Robot while I was at a service station waiting for my car to be fixed.  I was fasinated by the movie, but, I didn't have time to finish it.  I felt I just had to get the film in blue ray so I could finish watching it.  I immediately got on Amazon and ordered I Robot and I'm pleased that I did!!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|The album is great muse. Madness gets a lot of air time on the radio right now, but every song on that album is great as well.
B008Y212PI|5.0|absolutely love this game, could spend hours playing it!!  Very challenging and keeps your brain working!  I really hope that you continue yo make more of these types of games.  The art work is also done beautifully!
0345803493|5.0|I thought this book was amazing. I can read it over and over again. I would definitely recommended fifty shades darker to anybody I come across.
1936608898|5.0|For me, the biggest thing I liked about the book were the easy to implement advices. One was how to build your food plate. The other was about when and how much to eat. Simple instructions. It's been 30 days and I sleep better, energy is higher and loving the foods. Less irritability. One warning, is that this book didn't solve everything for me and alas, it's only been 30 days, so I think there's more to be learned for me in my particular case. My goal is to have loads of energy all day ... getting there. This book is a must have in my library, I bought 2. Best of luck to you.
B008M721MS|5.0|I got my new Kindle HD 7\\" yesterday.  I downloaded the SKYPE app.  This was the main reason that I upgraded from the original Kindle Fire.  I did a Skype session this afternoon with my daughter-in-law and grandbaby this afternoon.  Worked wonderful!  I had no problems whatsoever getting it working.  I already had a Skype account that I used on my desktop computer.  Logged in. D-I-L called and I answered with video...  was wonderful.  Good quality picture.  She sent me photos via Skype at the same time that we were video chatting.  They came through just fine. A really great App and for me, it was worth getting the Kindle Fire HD.  Thanks, Amazon and Skype.  Now I can Skype with them no matter where I am (as long as I can get wifi).
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Great app. Tubemate. Works great for me. Galaxy s3. I have no problems with it. easy to use,all the downloads were very fast.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This game is very cool and fun! all these little birds sure do pack a punch! its fun for everybody and each bird has a different trait. the yellow one can speed up. the little blue one can split into 3. and u knock down buildings in so many themes levels! u should really get this game!! BEWARE LITTLE GREEN PIGS!!!!!
0451418441|5.0|This second book was just as great as the first one \\"Fall of Giants\\".  I am waiting for the third book to see how it all comes together in the end.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Well John Grisham you did it again. Another great read. I was fascinated by the planning that went on to get where they want to be.(don't want to give anything away here.)<br /> Highly recommend all his books.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Despite the fact that I already had about 7 or 8 of her songs, this CD was certainly worth buying!  I love her newer items (Zi-Zi's Adventure, Moon Trance, and Anti-Gravity stick out for me), and it was great to hear all of the songs I've come to love.<br /><br />The only thing I can complain about is that the \\"springy\\" part of the cd-holding section of the case (looks like a small circle with cuts in it?)- some of the teeth broke the first time I took the CD out and so the CD doesn't stay in its spot and easily moves around, even when the case is closed.  Granted, I could just put it in another case.<br /><br />But, highly recommended, a wonderful album.  I hope this is only the first of many by this talented artist!
B008KY5X2I|5.0|Gabriel Macht plays Harvey Specter Superbly.  Although he is surrounded by an excellent cast he manages to steal the spotlight on those scenes he is in.  The screenplay is well done if you get past the unlikelihood that a partner in a major NYC law firm would tell major lies to his firm about a new attorney he hired.  (Played by Patrick J. Adams) No matter how talented he is, can you ever conceive of his being hired in the real world?  If you can get past that premise then sit down and enjoy the series.  This series has many fine actors in supporting cast.  Louis Litt is portrayed by Rick Hoffman and is the man you love to hate.  He is such a good actor you hate him and feel empathy for him at the same time.  The screen writers take the time to develop each of the main characters. There are no shallow personalities on this show.  They have layers that are peeled back as the series progresses and the audience gets to understand what motivates them.  What I like about this show is my favorite characters has changed several times, that is rare.  It is a tribute to how well the show works.  All in all, this is a very well done show that is worth the time to invest in it to get to know the characters.  It is very entertaining.  If you haven't seen it, make time for it.  Each episode gets better.
B005Q6MJ8O|3.0|I somehow managed to make it through my childhood without ever coming across C.S. Lewis and the Chronicles of Narnia. I had heard of the series but never read it, and it's only now as an adult that I have picked up \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\". I knew a little going in; there was a magical land known as Narnia, it featured a lion, and somehow a wardrobe was invovled.<br /><br />The book centers around four children, Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy. They have been sent away from London to escape the air raids of World War II and are staying at a professor's house in the country. While exploring the mansion one day, the youngest, Lucy, comes across an old cupboard that houses coats. Opening it up to hide in, she discovers that, rather than being an ordinary wardrobe, it is a gateway to a magical land called Narnia. There are many interesting creatures, from unicorns to giants, centaurs and dwarves. Sadly, Narnia has been put under a spell by an evil witch who has made it winter all the time - but never Christmas. The land is waiting to be freed, and freedom can only happen with a war against the witch and those on her side.<br /><br />Lucy eventually makes it back to the professor's house and quickly tells her siblings what she has seen. They don't believe her, even when Edmund accompanies her into the wardrobe on another adventure in the land. There, he is met and falls under the witch's spell. Eventually, all four siblings enter the magical land, where they participate in a battle to rid Narnia of the witch and restore Aslan as ruler of all.<br /><br />I've read commentary that the Chronicles of Narnia is a very religious series, and coming from a Christian perspective, I can agree. Aslan is definitely representative of Jesus Christ, and aspects of the story mimic biblical events. But this is something I was looking for as I was reading; if I hadn't been aware of it, I may not have made the connection. And, while this book isn't as vivid as, say, Harry Potter, it is still a great tale.<br /><br />Overall, while I was less than thrilled with \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\", I can see the appeal to children. I am going to delve into the rest of the series to see what it's about; after all, it's a fast read and an interesting one at that.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is full of fun.you get to build families collect coins ect.this game is fine not one thing wrong with it.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I thought this book was definitely geared to a British audience and was mostly boring. I do not reccomend it. I hope she brins bak Harry potter as head master.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game.  very addicting. the only thing ive never passed is the endless I zombie. I cant get to level 10 or whatever it is that you need to pass it. otherwise I love it.
B004PR71JC|5.0|Our granddaughter loves this movie and was very excited when I started playing the CD in the car. She loves the music from the movie and was happy to listen to the songs in the car. Great CD!
B0010XR2WK|5.0|Wonderful show. I wish it would have never gone off. Clear picture! I used this episode as a teaching tool with my class on a discussion on criminal trials.
B0091TGWYE|5.0|This is a great product.  When I opened up the package, I was pleasantly surprised at the nice quality of the leather.  The sleeve has a very high quality look, having nice stitching and good quality leather.  It looks great in-hand.  The phone fits snugly, as the name implies.  The case is fairly rigid, and should provide reasonable protection from any bumps while carrying it.  The pull tab brings the phone out enough to pull it out fully.  I am impressed with the case, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a low-profile leather slip-cover that provides some protection, and looks more expensive than it is.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This was a wonderful fantasy novel. I agree with the massive number of readers who have enjoyed it.  It is the story of Kvothe (pronounced almost like Quothe) who has been \\"the hero and villain of a thousand tales\\" and is presumed dead.  He keeps hidden as an inn keeper under a false identity.  A chronicler comes to town, uncovers Kvothe's true identity, and pressures the protagonist to tell his life story.  I found the story extremely engaging and I believe the author was especially good at bringing us to care about Kvothe.  The amount of magic and fantasy is relatively light and I think this increases the book's appeal among adults.  Kvothe's extremely slow and hesitant attempts to win over the love of his life are especially touching.  My only complaint is that I felt the plot could have moved a bit quicker.  I couldn't help but thinking that the author was purposely slowing things down in order to insure enough material for three volumes.  Nevertheless, I am anxious to read the second volume very soon.  I prefer a 10 point scale for ratings, and gave it a 9 our of 10.
B003BWERF8|5.0|Used on the square nano.  Works perfectly.  Uses the nano battery but my wife hasn't complained about it running the battery down too fast.
030759565X|5.0|I have been following Deb's blog for a few years and have tried many of her recipes and haven't ever been dissappointed.  Her writing in the book (and the blog) is very funny and witty and I love to read about how each recipe came about.  From the cookbook, I tried the Chicken with Olives and Grapes right away because I had all of the ingredients and it was wonderful!  My kids and husband enjoyed it and my 8 YO son said that it's like something from a restaurant.  Now that's a compliment!  I also love her general cooking/kitchen tips; especially the one about getting rid of your measuring cups - that was truly a revelation!  I have a big kitchen in the suburbs, so I can't relate to cooking in a tiny NYC apartment, but it doesn't matter because the recipes work in kitchens big or small.
1469984202|5.0|This book is fantastic! It is well written and keeps you wanting more. I just order book # 6 in the series.
1476715904|5.0|I think I just did a Chuck Norris round house kick to the 'hell yeah!' If you haven't read this book, or have it collecting dust on your shelf, stop what you're doing and get it! Bump it up in your must read pile! I'll wait...hurry up, go get it!  This book was recommended to me a while ago and I debated because the synopsis really didn't grab me. Boy, was I a ding dong! Thank you NetGalley for giving me a second chance to review this exquisite read. Don't let the back cover blurb fool you, this isn't just another teen drama, but a goose bump, toe-curling, tear-jerking, comical and gut-wrenching miraculous book. I swear, I physically ran the gamut on emotions. It was like I had the worst case of PMS ever to hit my body in a 24 hour period, but instead of hormones, this was literary induced. Perhaps I should note: I have only cried once (yes, once!) while reading a book, so I'm not a gooey girl by a long shot. However, I must confess the content hit on real life issues I've similarly experienced. Even if you haven't gone through similar trials and tribulations, I can't image any reader would not be able to connect with the characterization and depiction of the topics. Seriously, if you don't get all funny feeling at some point during this read you need to go see the Wizard, because your heart is obviously made of tin!<br /><br />Deep breath....okay, now that I've gone all fan girl, let me talk seriously about what makes it great. The voice is genuine and consistent. It also varies between characters, making them unique and easy to decipher. From the beginning, you get a clear idea of style and pacing without it being predictable. The author throws in a few zingers and twists proving they don't have to be totally unrealistic to get you gasping. Because of this, it is the type of read you'll probably not want to put down. I read it in a day because I just didn't want to stop! Without giving too much away, the involvement of musical lyrics at the beginning of the chapters is working on multiple levels. This is important and enriches the purpose making the inclusion more than just a cool idea. The tie-in to the rhythm of the characters lives measured against the meter of slam poetry, and coupled with driving meaning behind the lyrical proses is an ambitious task that Hoover pulls off masterfully. Bravo! As I said, this is so much more than just another teen drama. It will appeal to a wide readership. Slammed is an engaging, entertaining, moving and best of all, it comes across as what seems to be an effortless work of literature, but it's not.  It is complex enough to be discussed, compared and contrasted with other literary works. I recommend Slammed for a personal read, classroom or book group.

0321344758|5.0|What a great resource on usability!<br /><br />Many designers (or would be designers & do-it-yourselfers) don't realize the role usability (UI / UX) makes in the bounce rates for their sites.<br /><br />I highly recommend this resource to explain the why's and why-not's that most people miss.<br /><br />The book is written in launguage that is common sense and practical. You will definitely get your money's worth.
B008GVD6D8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it actually has a fairly decent story line besides all the naughty stuff and of course its good enough to follow on from fifty shades.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I bought the Kindle Fire for grad school to &quot;organize&quot; and keep my pdf's and research material on one device. The HORROR after two weeks of use, 30 pdfs, 5 textbooks, and 15 free ebooks later was maddening. I spent two days searching discussion boards before i finally picked up the buzzword &quot;file manager&quot; and searched for apps. Ijust downloaded this and almost cried with delight and relief. All of my documents instantly were uploaded and organized in folders with drop down list views like in windows explorer. Granted the naming convention for already exsting docs is a little annoying and I will probably spend my friday night renaming files, but its soo worth it! Now I have no more buyers remorse. This solves the &quot;collection&quot; and organizing documents problem new kindle users are facing.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|These blocks are absolutely great, genius in their simplicity and fun for everyone in the house.  The only problem is that now we all want more.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was so excited about reading this book since I am a fan of JK Rowling's work.  I'm just really disappointed with every aspect of the book.  It featured a bland storyline with really scummy characters.  There wasn't enough reconciliation in the end to justify reading it.  If I want to hear a depressing story without a happy ending, I'll watch the news.
0812973992|5.0|A book that just blows you away.  It is not a book that you read in one sitting.  I sometimes stopped reading and closed the book, because that one sentence was so powerful, so beautiful written that I could not keep on reading.  The stories are so intricately woven, yet so balanced that it is magical.  While you know that the tight-rope walker will keep his balance high above, the people below are loosing theirs...and yet. Brilliant, brilliant book.
B00304RMFE|1.0|I am a big fan of the halo games but I did not like this movie much at all. It had too much anima which I don't care for. It for the most part was cheaply made. There is one good part with some Spartans kickin ... Butt  but that was about 10 min of the movie
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Totally fulfilled my fifty hangover. Totally a different story line with the same intensity. A must read for fifty lovers
B007FEZQF8|3.0|I more fondly appreciate Kirkman after reading the first issue. Having said that, the show is so much better. Graphic novels aren't my cup of tea. The art is great, the story was way too sparse.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Enjoyed learning about another culture through this beautifully filmed story of a girl who has a love of family and nature!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|But when I do it's because the music is simply amazing. The way the Pianoguys blend the various genres of music seamlessly together is incredible. If you haven't seen their videos they are worth a watch.  They show a group of guys passionately playing music and enjoying what they are doing. I was concerned the music alone would lose something with out the visuals.  I have never been happier to be wrong.  Their passion and enjoyment permeate every note of this album!  This is the kind of music I wish would top the charts!
B00785P2QC|3.0|this is a nice game.  you can end up spending a lot of money to progress. otherwise progress is very slow.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Shows he potential the Halo universe holds in the Feature Film/Show department. Excellent acting, writing, and effects that makes a great movie quality narrative on a relatively shoestring budget.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it is a very entertaining app! but you can only get a maximum of 40 coins but it is an amazing app!:) GET IT!:)
B00000DCHI|5.0|I have alot of greatest hits cds,this one of the best.Great quality.If you are having a party,this is great party music.
B004132HZS|5.0|This show is wonderful! I have gotten my whole fa,ily and quite a few friends addicted to it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are a wonderful pairing. One of the best Sherlock adaptations ever!
B006LSZECO|3.0|After reading all the reviews of this book, I bought it and was mildly sorry I bothered. It is written well, and there were parts of the story I thought were clever and good. But<br />overall, except for a brief surprise in one chapter, I wished I could return it to Amazon. Good, if familiar, premise but by the end, I was left unsatisfied and wished<br />one of the two lead characters had killed each other or themselves. Sorry to say: not as great as the reviews.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|If you type a message for the other person playing or vice versa, the app becomes defective and stops working. Very disappointing!
B006LSZECO|4.0|What did I like about this book? Well, let's make a list.<br /><br />1. The two main characters are writers, and much of their story is told in a diary format (some in actual diary entries). Because it's told in the words of two writers, it is fantastically well written. The imagery is so detailed, the emotions so real. Some of the phrases feel like they were crafted like a piece of old furniture - worked and reworked until they were just perfect.<br /><br />2. Subterfuge. There were several locations in the book where I thought I knew what was going on - or what was going to go on - only to find out that something totally different was happening. I read a lot of crime/mystery novels, and the author does a fantastic job of using that fact to her advantage. In other words, the fact that I'm a fan of the genre actually worked against me in trying to figure out the ending. This was awesome because I kept guessing about how it would end until it did.<br /><br />3. The ending. Ok, so really the last 25% of the book. I loved seeing some of the characters changing their plans, making new ones, having to deal with things going awry... I wanted some of the characters to get more of what was coming to them, and others not, but who I wanted to get what changed throughout the book. I could have been satisfied with a couple of different endings, and the one that was presented... well, I might have wanted it to be a little different, but it was good.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I couldn't wait for the second installment after reading the first.  Now I can't wait for the third one!  Enjoyed both of these books.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|Only Tim Burton and Johnny Depp could pull off this remake of the classic TV show. A touch campy, a touch melodrama, good effects that don't scream at you, \\"HEY! I'm a special effect!\\".<br /><br />I found it true to the spirit of the original TV show (which I watched as a kid against my mother's orders) and yet its own creation.<br /><br />The only item I went back and forth upon was Depp's make-up as it was both a send-up of Nosferatu and a bit jarring to the suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />All in all, a good evening's viewing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is exciting, challenging and just plain fun! Love it! And its free, not $5 or $6 bucks.. GREAT GAME!
1469984202|5.0|This series was absolutely fantastic.  Each story congruent and interesting. Couldn't put it down.  I am really looking forward to next story and have really found myself wondering about the future of these characters.  In the past I found it difficult to identify with characters in short stories but these were so wonderfully portrayed that they made me buy stock in each of them.  Buy this book, recommend this book.  This is a great read!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Great historical read with blend of fiction and nonfictional characters.  The characters carry right into the second book of the series with the next generation.
B0091REZMW|5.0|graphics are great not easy sorta challenging the little goblins are cute :3 hahahahhah lol hi<br />how are you<br />good<br />good<br />good<br />cool<br />yeah I don't care
B007U4DIM6|3.0|Cute movie.  Kids liked it.  I guess if your young and you like dogs this is a good movie to curl up and watch.
B006H5120E|4.0|Seen it on DVD before, blu ray is amazing with crisp picture and sound, be sure to have good av receiver to get the best effects.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is much cheaper than the fair.... and tons more productive!  this is a definite keeper!<br />I've seldom found a game this fun for free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great app. very satisfying. helps pass the time. advertising is not obtrusive. love it. would recommend it to anyone.
0061245097|5.0|Being a one time fan of the Anita Blake series, I was more then excited to come across another series that I thoroughly enjoy.<br /><br />I absolutely love Cat and Bones and the relationship between them. After taking on a new life and working under Don, Cat trains her own unit of soldiers in her quest of ridding the undead.<br /><br />I got a little giddy when Bones was the man that showed up to her friends weddings, it was one of the most amusing scenes in the book - the attraction between them and the jealousy that Cat rides every time she meets one of Bones old flames are all rather amusing.<br /><br />More of the past comes hunting both Bones and Cat within these series and you can watch them come to life and grow with excellent character development that doesn't skip a beat. I grow more and more attached to these characters, and the ending over all in this book has me hoping to get my hands on the third one to continue this fascinating journey.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is addictive but entertaining.  it changes often enough to keep you going ... one more prize, one more special coin, one more... (:
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Well, if you're not supposed to, I will anyway... it's beautiful! Everything about it is beautiful. Let me highlight some of the things I love:<br /><br />1. The size is perfect<br />2. The weight is perfect<br />3. The blade is sharp (the finish is cool too)<br />4. The heel can be used for multiple things<br />5. It's extremely well made<br />6. This is the best sheath I've ever seen for a knife like this (more like a SCUBA sheath)<br />7. Even the box it came in is cool<br /><br />Don't think about it too much, just go for it; you won't be disappointed.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is  terrific program.  The acting is superb and the script is amazing.  I love all of the characters and the plot lines.
B008PNBU30|5.0|I love this cd so much, especially \\"Chalk Outline\\".<br />I would recommend this. I enjoyed it very much. Saw them live at Pain in the grass and they played this song. It was awesome. That's why I wanted this cd.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Yay! I'm so excited that they finally came out with a live version of phantom of the opera. I am a huge fan of this musical. I've seen it twice in NY and I own the movie version of it, not to mention some collectiables.But this, live 25 anniversary addition is so much better than the movie. ( of coarse it dosen't compare to seeing it live in person, but it's the next best thing.) The music is beyond words. It's soft,sometimes loud. Dark, haunting, hypnotic, out of this world, incrediable music. It dosen't get better than phantom. And the storyline is romantic and gothic.I love the Phantom. Especially his since of humor. For those of you who don't know what Phantom of the Opera is about it's about a musical genius who lives underneath the Paris Opera House and he falls obsessivly in love with the soprano singer at the opera, Christine. Raoul is the Phantom's rival for Christine's affections. There is a special surprize at the end of this addition of Phantom some guest stars come out along with Andrew Lloyd webber and sing. The only thing that I had a big problem with with this dvd is that the chandelier does not come crashing towards the audience like it would in the NY version if seen in person. I would think, since this version is supposed to be the best and they made a big deal over it, that it would have the chadelier crash. But nooo. That was my only let down for this. Other than that Phantom is Phantastic.
B0026OE2NY|1.0|I know the content is good as I previously saw it on French TV, but the DVD I was sent in the UK is a region 1 DVD which does not work on m UK equipment. I  can therefore do nothing with it . Shipping it back to the US at twice the cost of the DVD seems not worth it .... I have asked for a refund but will probably not get it as item opened and not resent.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan delivers again in the 3rd installment of the Heroes of Olympus series. The story line is fresh and the action does not fail to drive you to the edge of your seat. Once I started I could not put it down until I had completely devoured the entire book. I look forward to the next installment.
B001CTDH76|5.0|I just absolutely love the many different/various episodes that can be watched.  They're all about 42 to 45 minutes long (not the full hour) but the nice thing is you can watch individual episodes per disc or the entire disc in continuous format.  The best thing -- they're not all cluttered/full of commercials! One of the reasons why I watch movies and not prime time tv!
0547995660|4.0|...where everyone is taken care of.  Infants are never neglected, are always well fed, and are always raised by parents who want them.  Old people are never neglected, not just taken care of but entertained and comforted in every way possible.  People thrive in workplaces that they are well suited for, and no one is \\"better\\" than anyone else, all are healthy and thrive.  Well, unless you don't \\"fit in\\"...<br /><br />  This book really roped me in.  It's easy to read and the characters make you want to root for them.  It's hard to put down.  I have just one complaint.<br /><br />  WAY TOO EXPENSIVE.  It should be a Kindle single.  It only takes 3 hours or so to read in entirety.  So then you download the second of the quartet (which is a whole different sort of reality, but characters are just as wonderful and the tale just as compelling) and that's another $7.51 or something.  The last of the quartet is almost $10 because it's new.  All four of them together can easily be read in a week even for slower readers, and it costs about $35.00.<br /><br />  So I'm a little upset because I started 2 days ago with the first book and am 77% through the second already and really shouldn't spend so much money to finish the series, which I will surely do anyway within the next few days.  I might suggest to others using Kindle that maybe they should wait until the whole quartet is available together at a reduced rate, because you will want the whole quartet anyway.

0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas: Here is the term used in the book. \\"What wouldn't I give now for a never-changing map of the ever-constant ineffable? To possess, as it were, an atlas of clouds.\\"<br /><br />I believe it to mean a set of data so preposterous and large that even god herself cannot manifest the calculations.<br /><br />This book is a collection of short stories, their relevance to each other delicately revealed as each narrative is brought to a climax.  I laughed many times and would have cried if not for my icy male resolve. I especially loved the Frobisher story. I cannot say how much I loved this book because I am not a gifted author.  Extremely gratifying.  The entire book is thoughtful and exciting. A new favorite in my cache of reading. Thank you.<br /><br />Some of my highlights:<br /><br />\\"Peace, though beloved of our Lord, is a cardinal virtue only if your neighbors share your conscience.\\"<br /><br />\\"Faith, the least exclusive club on Earth, has the craftiest doorman.\\"<br /><br />\\"What if the differences between social strata stem not from genomics or inherent excellence or even dollars, but merely differences in knowledge? Would this not mean the whole Pyramid is built on shifting sands?\\"<br /><br />\\"As if Art is the What, not the How!\\"<br /><br />\\"The forces that really kick ass are all invisible.\\"<br /><br />\\"The glances musicians exchange, when music is effortless, that was what he wanted.\\"<br /><br />\\"Because she makes me think about something other than myself.\\"

B008XX6J4C|5.0|These men have the love of their wives and children but also that of their fans. All of The Piano Guys,even those behind-the-scenes, are artists! Every song they record is beautifully done...their original pieces are awesome and their covers are usually better than the original. They LOVE what they do- it is apparent by the spirit of their music (and if you see their videos and watch their expressions you would concur). If I wasn't 60 years old- and more musically inclined, I would seriously be inspired to take up cello or piano lessons. I know that the younger members of our family are considering it.<br />These men can even make Pachabel's Canon in D a hip song! This album is a delight! The only downside is that it took so long for them to release it. :)
B007THA4FI|4.0|I have never read any Harry Potter books so this was a first for me. I loved the depth of her writing, totally left me wanting more. A great writer, the reason for 4 stars is I dont know if it is possible to give 4.5 stars. The only reason for not giving 5 stars is i wanted even more depth on some characters & i wasnt ready for the book to finish. having said that i am very picky & have up to now never given a 5 star rating.If you are into real English village life with great characters & a great story you will love this!

B009EANE3M|4.0|Solid album with a concerted effort to move more towards R&B sound.  This album does not contain any \\"The man that can't be moved\\" or \\"(heart)Breakeven\\" songs.  It has more of a pop feel. If you enjoy Top 40 and/or The Script, you will enjoy this album.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Hans Zimmer is the man! Great music, great quality, has the ID tags works perfectly in itunes and on the iphone and ipad.
B008673ZAQ|1.0|I was very disappointed in this book.  It tries so hard to be a \\"Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy\\" wannabe.  I thought this would have fresh ideas, plots and characters.  Everything was a rip-off of \\"Fifty Shades\\".<br />If you haven't read the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy and are looking for something different, go ahead and get this book.  But if you have, you'll be very disappointed.

B0041D843M|4.0|Very interesting book which makes me question why we haven't heard more about this study. Are organisations wielding their power and shielding their interests and maybe actively protecting themselves and preventing this information from becoming common knowledge.  It is a book that tells us how to eat to keep healthy for life.
B009ZQBZZE|5.0|If this is your genre, go for it. Fun ride. Great esccape with mindless entertainment. As I said, if this is your genre go for it and you will enjoy.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|It was a light and fun movie - really a chick flick.  I'd have had a better time watching it with several friends.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I really liked this movie. It was more serious and dramatic than the older ones (especially the bubbly \\"Great Fairy Rescue\\"). The graphic and music were really awesome. The characters won my heart as well. BUT! There is something I just have to tell about. I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, so if you didn't watch it, then better don't read it.<br /><br />There are few things I don't understand.<br /><br />1) The winter fairies cannot leave the Winter Woods, because if they do, their wings will melt and break. But in the first \\"Tinkerbell\\" movie the snow fairies didn't have any problems with visiting the warmer places. There was even Quana who put the magical snowflake on the mushroom. The Minister of Winter (that tall, white-haired woman) also visited the Queen's Pixie Dust Tree. None of them had a problem with wings or fainting of heat. I know that the \\"Tinkerbell\\" was made before \\"Secret of the Wings\\" but I don't like the mistakes like that. In the first 3 movies the winter fairies could easily fly to the warm kingdroms and in this one they can't?<br /><br />2) If the winter fairies cannot leave the Winter Woods because of their wings, then how do they travel to the mainland? They have to pass by the ocean and visit the warm countries. There is no snow or coldness.<br /><br />And finally the number 3 - but it is related with the all movies about Tinkerbell. The main characters like Tink, Fawn, Rosetta, Silvermist, Fairy Mary, Queen Clarion or the couple of the guys have original looks. But the rest of the fairies look almost the same. There are only few styles of looks and the Disney company doesn't care about creating more. For example - one of the winter fairies looked exactly like the crying one from the \\"Pixie Hollow games\\". Another male fairy looked like Buck. It happens all the time and is annoying, because the certain fairies lose their individuality.<br /><br />That's all I wanted to write. \\"The Secret of the Wings\\" is a very nice movie and people who have seen the earlier movies probably will like it.
B0013TPVGK|5.0|This is a very good book for a serious musician looking for some very valuable insights to becoming a better musician.  If you are looking for some inner self help tips and you are a serious musician trying to improve in your playing then this is the book for you.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I was not sure at first when my five year old son wanted this game. However after getting it and seeing him play with it, I am impressed with it. He has to build and balance the different towers to play and then postition the sling shot in the correct place in order to knock it over. I have since ordered two additional Angry Birds games for him and love the fact that he would rather play this then watch tv or play some sort of video game. :)

B0098460O4|3.0|Just don't expect what you heard on BGT. They mostly alternate singing and<br />seldom sing together. When they do sing together Charlotte's voice tends<br />to get lost in the backing choir. Who thought they needed a choir anyway?<br />Track 6 is the only one that features them as a duo and it is incredible.<br />The combination of their voices is what I expected to hear and this CD is<br />disappointing. Too much orchestra, way too much choir, and too little J&C together.
B004LUS390|4.0|WHAT IS SKETCHBOOK MOBILE?<br />Sketchbook Mobile is a game especially made for an artist. It includes many tools to use so you can make the perfect piece of art on your kindle.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE:<br />There are so many choices on Sketchbook. The app has so many tools to modify your brush, whether it's the color or the thickness. It really has so many choices for you so you can have your picture made just how you like it. Sketchbook has nice graphics so you can admire your creation clearly. It's not just a simple coloring and drawing game. I like how it's very advanced, but simple to use. If you love to sketch, this is the app for you.<br />WHAT I DISLIKE:<br />This app costs two dollars, and there is a free version. Although, this edition is more advanced and has many more options. The free one a nice app too, but I think it's more fit for beginners. If you have a huge passion for art I suggest paying two dollars for this version.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|Being one of my favorite bands, I was crushed the morning I learned Roy Khan had quit Kamelot. I thought there is no way the band would ever be the same. Throughout the \\"poisoned\\" tour, I read that Fabio Lione (whom I thought was a strange fit for Kamelot), was doing most of the vocal duties. Being a Seventh Wonder fan for a couple years now, I heard that Tommy was doing some songs/shows occasionally and I thought that would be great, but there's no way.<br />  Fast forward to the days before the announcement for the new singer was revealed. I just knew it was going to be Fabio. There were two people in the world (besides Roy, of course) whom I wanted to be the one. Tommy was my first choice, and Michael Eriksen (Circus Maximus). When I read Tommy's name, I was ecstatic! I couldn't wait to hear the NEW Kamelot.<br />  I though with \\"Ghost Opera\\", the band was going in some strange directions, but I do like it a lot (after it grew on me for a while). \\"Poetry For The Poisoned\\", not so much! There were a few great songs, but I did'nt like the \\"weirdness\\" of it. Unlike my other albums, I just kinda put it away.<br />  Now, the melodic Kamelot is back with an outstanding singer. I couldn't be happier. Yes, he does sound like Roy a lot of the time, but who wouldn't? That is their style. Listen to \\"Song For Jolee\\" if you want to get the real feel of Tommy's incredible voice.<br />  In a nutshell, 4.75/5 stars for me. Not a throwaway track in the bunch and the story is quite interesting, too. Melodic metal fans, you won't be disappointed!
0307200477|3.0|I received this book from a number of friends and family, because they think it's just fabulous. I can see the benefits of having a tactile book to explore with little hands and connect to what's being described. However, the page on \\"smells\\" is just absolutely a deal breaker. I'm very sensitive to parfume, and this book gave me a headache almost immediately. The smell page stinks like the strongest and cheapest clothes dryer sheet you've ever smelled. Just turning to that page was more than I could handle. I put it away after reading it only once. Sadly, not aware of my dislike for this book, my mother in law brought another copy for my daughter to read. I didn't have the heart to tell her or my husband that I had this negative reaction to it, so thought I'd wait it out. After opening it once, my husband commented on the absolutely unbearable and offensive smell of the book, and he's not one to notice strong smells! Sadly, this book will not be on our baby's library shelf as it's just too toxic and disgusting!<br /><br />Love the idea of the book, but please change the scent page!!

0307361012|4.0|This is the first Jo Nesbo novel I have read, and first in the detective Harry Hole series I believe. The plot was intricate, and it kept me guessing right to the end. Nesbo has painted some real strong characters here, and weaved them in with some Aussie history, and his own Norwegian back story. I personally like the way this author shifted from character to character, and scene to scene. I have read many reviews about his more recent works, and judging from this one, I am looking forward to how this series and character evolve. I think I'll be a huge fan of the series. Hole' character is very realistic and different in many ways to the standard detective fare. I am eagerly awaiting my next excursion with Harry.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|This is one of those rare stories that sticks with you many years after you first read it.  I'm normally a paranormal fiction/science Fiction/Fantasy fan, so reading a straight up suspense novel with shades of the paranormal like this book is a refreshing break from my norm.  Read this book if you are interested in a quick, suspensefull read that keeps you on the tip of your toes.
B0031RSA24|5.0|Dawkins' invocation of the Darwinian concept of evolution through natural selection in \\"The God Delusion\\" seems to bear a parallel in one essential sense to Hawking's explanation in terms of physics in his The Grand Design, where quantum theory would appear to make the idea of an independent God unnecessary. However, both in biology and in physics, in Dawkins and in Hawking, there are two viewpoints which, perhaps unwittingly, reinforce the views of both writers - and yet... there seems no need in either book to conclude that God, particularly a good, loving or benevolent god, SHOULD not exist.<br /><br />On the one hand, while Dawkins, like Hawking, may argue that God does not 'exist', Dawkins acknowledges that there has been an essential need within human psychology for such a god and, indeed, that the belief in a deity as we see, for instance, in the Christian religion, is actually a part of our evolution in surviving as coexisting individuals/societies/countries.<br /><br />For his part, Hawking, on considering the integration of the main theories of modern physics explainS how, of necessity, the universe materialised and how God's 'role' in its metamorphosis could, in so far as such a role might exist, be no more than a consequence of quantum theory.<br /><br />Both books, the biological and the physical explanation on the 'redundancy' of God, tend for me to rob the imagination of the magic, awe and mystery of an independent entity to whom we might also attribute love and compassion for humanity. Moreover, I am not enthusiastic about jumping on the bandwagon of those who would instantly rejoice that we have in Dawkins' or Stephen Hawking's excellent books a glorious battle between science and religion in which science is logically bound to attain its own omniscience and omnipresence while religion should crawl away in shame for all it has tried to achieve for mankind across millennia.<br /><br />Whilst it is sadly true, particularly in Medieval times, that Christianity has often been convenient as a dogma by which to achieve the subservience of the multitude, nevertheless, a belief in a loving, benevolent God, the 'Father', has also done much to deliver mankind from slipping into the quicksands of brutality which have so often threatened to surface as the product of international ego.<br /><br />Some will gloat that in Dawkins and Hawking's books their parallel theories might deliver us from superstition and bigotry but I am not at all sure that either saw their theories like this nor that they would need to deny that the deity as we conceive it (with our attributions to it as a repository of love and grace), is in fact an essential part of mankind's improved evolution and so its survival.<br /><br />For, do natural selection/quantum theory and God inevitably need to be mutually exclusive?<br /><br />If we are able to concede that, for example, a Christian God is not an 'independent' entity or mover of the universe but simply our intellectual (and emotional) CONSTRUCT - albeit the repository of all the highest aspirations our human credo can attribute to a deity; there is every reason why our construct of a good and loving God SHOULD exist - if only for our sanity, dignity and - if I can be forgiven the image of one walking around with a placard -  our deliverance from evil.<br /><br />If we are left only with science - vital though it is (as a tool) to our survival - will THAT deliver us, again, from a WW1 or a WW2?stianity has often been convenient as a dogma by which to achieve the subservience of the multitude, nevertheless, a belief in a loving, benevolent God, the 'Father', has also done much to deliver mankind from slipping into the quicksands of brutality which have so often threatened to surface as the product of international ego.<br /><br />Some will gloat that in Dawkins and Hawking's books their parallel theories might deliver us from superstition and bigotry but I am not at all sure that either saw their theories like this nor that they would need to deny that the deity as we conceive it (with our attributions to it as a repository of love and grace), is in fact an essential part of mankind's improved evolution and so its survival.<br /><br />For, do natural selection/quantum theory and God inevitably need to be mutually exclusive?<br /><br />If we are able to concede that, for example, a Christian God is not an 'independent' entity or mover of the universe but simply our intellectual (and emotional) CONSTRUCT - albeit the repository of all the highest aspirations our human credo can attribute to a deity; there is every reason why our construct of a good and loving God SHOULD exist - if only for our sanity, dignity and - if I can be forgiven the image of one walking around with a placard -  our deliverance from evil.<br /><br />If we are left only with science - vital though it is (as a tool) to our survival - will THAT deliver us, again, from a WW1 or a WW2?
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|The Matrix itself is an amazing action movie with mind blowing special effects.  It keep my intrest from start to finish and only a few movies actually ever keep my intrest from start to finish.  The plotline I agree with most people makes you think of that was the real world and your eyes were just open for first time for example when you can say welcome to the real world.  So if your looking for for a great action film with scfi elements and great fight scenes then this is the movie for you to enjoy time and time again.  I have watched it mutiple times since it first came out and never ever get tired of it.  This is defently a great add on to any action movie collection so if you dont have it yet buy it now, you wont be sorry.
0307730697|5.0|I listened to the book on my iPod. I'm going to buy the book because I want my fifteen yr old son to read it, so he can, hopefully, realize what kind of incredible people we have on the front line protecting us. I was moved to tears at times.  Great book.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded was actually a good second film in the series.  To me the movie was just as amazing as the first movie, though it did have more plotline then action scenes.  But that didn't ruin the movie it made it more enjoyable to me because I enjoy movies with plotlines, also with action scenes.  But in any movie don't ever believe the reviews you read, sometimes you just have to make up your own mind about the movie you want to see and sometimes just take a chance on seeing it.  I've been watching the series since my college and high school days and still havent gotten tired of watching all 3 movies yet to this day, I'm 30 now.  But to me the movie had just enough plotline and action scenes to keep my intrest going in the series.  I would tell anyone to buy this series who enjoys great fight scenes and intresting plotlines.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great game with very good graphics, would be great if it was a little longer but still fun.
B0001BKAEY|4.0|The Matrix Revolutions was to me a good third and final movie in the series.  Just when I first saw the movie long time ago what shock me was the different path it took to end the series.  I wont spoil it for those who have yet to see the series in it wholeness.  To me it still had a good storyline and enjoy action scenes to make the movie enjoyable and make your mind think. So if your like me and enjoy some great action scenes or fight scenes then pick this last movie up or do yourself a favor and buy the whole set at once and get the trilogy.  Also the movie wasn't over the top or lost it edge the directors knew what they were doing and made the best of the 3 movie series.  The way the ended the movie made lot of people mad but to me all it did was shock me I was like oh darn really never expected that.  So look into this movie series and be prepared to enjoy the movies time and time again.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|Tasteful, emotional, heartwarming and funny.  What more can one ask from a movie.  The subject was one that is rarely approached and was handled with skill and good taste.
B007MDB6L0|4.0|This movie is typical of most Disney series in that it contradicts previous titles (as per this movie Winter fairies are forbidden from entering the \\"warm\\" side, but in the original TinkerBell there are clearly Winter fairies in attendance at her arrival and a snowflake is placed as a talent item... Also the Minister of Winter makes an appearance or two and she doesn't exist in this movie, being replaced by the Lord of Winter...). This is enough to bother me, but not my daughter (4 years old) yet. She was upset by the missing scenes, the pictures on the cover of the movie are misleading as some of the 'screenshots' never happen.<br /><br />But this is still a good movie and has entertained us and my daughter loves it :)

B009NPKTN6|1.0|I love 80's hairbands, musicals, and movies- but this combination of the three does not work.  I had read the bad reviews, but figured with this cast, it could not be that bad.  I WAS WRONG.  Don't waste your time or money.  Parts of it were over the top cheesy which I appreciated, because I thought they were making fun of themselves and the 80's era; but then there were too many parts that felt serious, which then had me wondering if I'd misread the parody.  The parts with Stacee Jaxx- were over the top funny, while the Sherri/ Drew parts were just too sweet and bordered dramatic.  The whole thing turns out to be a mess.  Very disappointed.
B009YDAUJ0|1.0|This review is for Amazon's \\"Streaming\\" not the show itself...because unfortunately I was unable to watch it since amazon doesn't know how to have reliable streaming.

On a side note, they had zero problem charging me for the show, at least they have that right. Don't waste your time and money, go somewhere else more reliable!!

It begins with the somber and moody opener Plainsong, and just continues to dazzle throughout the entire length of the album.  I particularly love its unhurried pace - more than a few songs begin with a lengthy and spectacular instrumental piece, as if Robert Smith is telling a beautiful story and is in no particular rush to get through it.  Instrumentally, Disintegration is sheer genius.  Electric guitar and synthesizer compliment each other perfectly throughout, with Simon Gallup's brilliant and underrated bass lines galvanizing the entire album, particularly in Fascination Street.  Pictures Of You is truly a classic, and instantly recognizable to anyone with even a passing interest in rock music coming out of the 80's.  Having said that, this album is not confined by the decade of its release.  It trancends any limitations that time and timely music would place upon it.  This album is truly enjoyable at any moment; past, present or future.  I usually list a handful of favorite songs from the album in my reviews, but I can't do that here - I love all of it.  Having come from The Cure, less enlightened listeners might dismiss it as a typical dreary and angst-driven album that their reputation would validate.  I, for one, have never dismissed The Cure is a 'doom and gloom' band, and I do not do so here.  In fact, I find this entire album laced with an undercurrent of hope - optimism that the clouds will part and the sun will soon shine through.  I will say with only the barest hint of facetiousness that if recorded music ceased to exist after the release of Disintegration, the art form would truly and greatly be fulfilled.  I hope you love this album as much as I have come to love it.  Thank you.

0709058764|5.0|I have bought 6 books on violin making and this one is the best by far. The instructions are clear and the photos and illustrations are top notch. The authors are masters of the art and there step by step instructions are excellent. I would say that if you by only one book to guide you on violin making this is the one to buy! It's worth exceeds it's higher price.
B008ER9QLK|4.0|This new Met Ring is quite traditional despite it's much talked about high-tech machine. With members of its faithful well-heeled customer base trumpeting they have seen 35 Rings \\"and want no changes\\", management would defy its paymasters at their peril and thank God for that. We have two modern Blu-ray Rings already and we do not need another just now.<br />The casting is outstanding. Deborah Voigt is brilliant in her first Br&uuml;nnhilde, and a vast improvement over Jennifer Wilson in the Spanish space age Ring. Hans-Peter K&ouml;nig looked a bit as if the rats had been at him as Hunding but was magnificent as Hagen. All the lesser members were exceptionally well cast, even Stephanie Blythe, whose many assets I thought might overwhelm her. Not a bit of it, she was well suited to Fricka who she played imperiously. Eric Owens as Alberich was another find. \\"I don't want to be just a black Alberich but chosen for my acting and musical skills\\". Well he deserved his part on great merit. Bryn Terfel's stocky Welsh frame is no match for Uusitalo, the giant Finn from the Arctic tunturi but what he lacks in size he makes up with good acting.<br />As usual the Met colour is drab and dark and it must be very frustrating being one of their cameramen. Focus is soft and the overlayed light patterns on the machine play havoc with actor definition. This is not a very good overall picture but it is far better than the old Met SD, it could just have been a lot better. The sound is generally good but it did not remind me of Solti! Now and again, (one example was in the Norn's scene), I detected some muddle in the sound. Let us see what others detect. I enjoyed this a lot and it is a worthy alternative to the brilliant Spanish space age Ring, although they are so different any comparison is not too helpful. Get both!
B007SGM084|1.0|This trilogy only had a few editing mistakes on the eBook edition, but it just honestly was not up to par with my expectations.  Christian is not a believable character, nor is a majority of the events in this book.  I've read better.
B000QUUD60|5.0|this elvis : that's the way its is, i buy for my 13 years old son as a gift,<br />soon as he received the CD, now feels like elvis had a concert in my house.<br />he loves it.<br />thanks alot<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000QUUD60 Elvis: That's the Way It Is (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B005G5PPGS|5.0|This is a great read for baseball fans and non fans alike. I found the math and number crunching very interesting and will probably never watch a baseball game the same again. Opinions vary on the use of sabermetrics, but I for one think it has alot of value. This book gives a real primer on it's use, while being easy to understand at the same time. Well written.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love this CD.  Yes, Rod is not singing rock music.  Who cares!  I especially love the duets with Ella Fitzgerald (What Are You Doing New Year's Eve) and Michael Buble (Winter Wonderland).  This version of Silent Night is also very nice.  I love how mellow this music is without losing the Christmas spirit.  Lovely.  If you get the CD you also get a free download from his upcoming Spring 2013 rock album.  Try these songs, you will find yourself singing them in your head. That is the sign of a good song.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I like this game.  It is like jewel quest where you match symbols but you have to release the pieces to pass the level.  Good when you need to pass the time!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good game provides lots of play time and provides ways to earn acorns and silver coins, instead of forcing u to buy like most games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the Wool Omnibus Edition 1-5 and now I hope that silo 18 drills through to silo 17 or at least makes suits so they can walk between the silo's so jimmy can have some more friends.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I never thought I would read Book One, but once I began reading the Fifty Shades Trilogy I had to keep going.  I loved Book Two! Christian and Ana discover more about each other and deepen their relationship.  There are twists and turns, humor, conflict and resolution.  A must read!
0375507256|2.0|This book showed promise during the first two sections but got weaker as it went on. The part about the nuclear power plant reminded me of Harold Robbins. The publishers journey to the nursing home bored me. The last straw was the prospect of wading through a chapter of dialect. That's where I quit. Literary novel? I don' think so.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I enjoyed this more than angry birds. I made it through the whole game without having to spend any money on it. The levels were nice and challenging. I found the game fun and addicting. Can't wait for the next level!
B0081BU42O|5.0|Fans of Banks and the Culture novels will love this. It strikes a welcome balance between epic scale and snarky humor, present in \\"Player of Games\\" and some of his other novels. Starts to explore the true nature of the universe in which the Culture novels take place.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the series. I am not a reader normally, but heard about these books and wanted to read them. So glad I did. Wish there was another.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Both the audio and written book are excellent.  Many people don't like the audio reader, but I've enjoyed her very much voices and all.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book takes you in a direction that has your emotions going on a rollercoaster ride ending with you knowing no matter what you have to go through true love is worth it...<br />At the end of this book I wasn't ready to let it end so I've reread this triology over four times.. I lost count.. This love story, these characters are so so worth it...
B00005JNNZ|4.0|This story says it is possible to reach young Americans otherwise ignored.  Glad it was made.  Share with your kids.
B00942V1J4|5.0|This movie touches your heart in a way that makes you want more... more time to get it right. It gives you hope that forever love does exist. If you've read the books and have watched the earlier three movies you can understand this... If you haven't I suggest you do. This love story touches the heart of all ages...
1423140605|3.0|I waited for this one. After reading the other two lost hero books, plus his original series, I was hoping this third one would be epic. Unfortunately, this one was bland, lacking originality. I'm still a fan. So, I hope the next one rocks.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book continues the journey of Ana and Christian and their struggle to be what the other needs them to be while not losing all of themselves.<br />I admire the people they are becoming and how they both are willing and ready to give all... just to spend forever together.<br />This love story can't help but make you feel alive and willing to maybe bend the rules a little.
B0097UO87U|5.0|By far the best thing I've hear all year.  If you are a Jeff Lynne fan this is a must.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I missed this movie when it was in the theater, so I was eager to see it. I enjoyed Judi Densch, the actress in her role as well as the other cast members. I found this to be entertaining and human interest story. It is a nice change from all the violence and in your face sex!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book candidly takes any woman on a secret \\"carpet ride\\". Fantasy has never been a sin. We all need to explore the horizins, whether it is fact or fiction. Body perfect, dreams amazing!!!!
B009GX7O56|5.0|We're big NCIS fans and enjoyed this new episode.  We had to find out what happened to Ducky after he was lying on the beach at the end of Season 9.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|This Album has got to be one of the best I've bought in a long time. Every song is phenomenal. Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is the best game ever it is in a way like temple run but much better. it is also very addicting. lots of things to unlock:characters. upgrades. everything... so I really like this game!
B0090CMMIC|5.0|Absolutely love this album!!! I found them on my satellite radio stations and have not stopped listening to them since I was able to purchase their album!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book kept me glued to my Kindle. This book had more twists and kept me eager for more. I can't wait to read the next one.
0375812024|5.0|My boys spend lots of time looking at the book, the eldest one even read it to the younger ones, that's very very sweet! We always love Richard Scarry's books ...
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I heard a couple of songs on the radio from this album and thought it would be nice to have it on CD.  I still have my vinyl copy but you can't play that anywhere.
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|For Clancy,,,  the only problem is the verbage in the first third of the book gets in the way of what should be an exciting story.  Names are introduced in quantity, and the action takes a backseat to unexciting background.  A great writer, but down the list from some of his other writings.  Like he squeezed a 400 page book into 800 pages.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|This is a truly entertaining, educational and thought-provoking book. It is also a very well-researched and documented historical analysis of real persons struggling with incredible challenges and in so doing achieving remarkable results. But I would disagree in part that the world has become modern. We are still straddling between a world of superstition and a world of rational, empirically-based reason. And this despite the historical context of the spot-on conclusions of the ancient Greek philosophers profiled in this book, and the renaissance discoverers who make up the main characters of our work-in-progress, namely, trying to become modern.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot get enough of this world. I have not read any novels in the last 10 years and I just finished all G. R. R. Martin Game of Thrones and related novels. Please write the next one soon.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|His voice and lyrics are just amazing and it gets you everytime. Great CD to listen to when you're on the road.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|nice free hack n slash action game. a little shallow so far but im only 2 floors in.<br />good graphics and controls
B008673ZAQ|5.0|GREAT BOOK!!! I can't wait for the last one! Sylvia Day is a great author!! Keep up the amazing work!!
B008RNGCAO|5.0|The thing I love about this series is that so many characters come into play. Multiple heroes, multiple villains and multiple plots. Plenty of emotional and physical conflicts. Looking forward to volume 2&3.
B00275EHJG|4.0|This is the only cartoon I have ever been in tears, to be honest. I'm not a cartoon person and don't watch so many kinds of cartoon. Even though, it beats any Disney cartoon in terms of story and character. It's worth watching again and again.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|THIS WAS A GREAT BOOK. EVA AND GUIDEON ARE A GOOD BUT YET COMPLICATED COUPLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE. I JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK!!!!!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|This is definitely a pretty solid game that plays very similarly to the wildly popular Bejeweled game. It includes some different mechanics that add to the experience, making it more interesting for longer.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I love this book. I read  the whole book on a plane ride back home. The characters were so well written I just kept turning page after page wanting to know what was going to happen. It was so believable, I could relate to what was going on with the characters, enjoyed it so much.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Deserted on an island and you can only bring one album.  This one would be a good choice.  This is the album that set Radiohead in the spotlight, and also gave them the cash to sit back and do what they wanted to do...Kid A namely.  Haven't seen this kind of album since Pink Floyd.  The whole disc is a journey, really.
B007V693YK|5.0|excellent app for any guitarist! i use this app on a daily basis to speed up learning new material for 3 bands i play in.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. It was very well written and the story unfolds deliciously.<br />Both characters are despicable and sick and amazing and it's impossible to put the book down. You just can't believe what they will do next. I like books that are not the \\"same old thing\\" like whodunnits, love stories, etc and this book fits that bill. Unique, terrific writing style, a story and characters like none other. Great job, Gillian Flynn!!!
0525478817|5.0|***I WILL ATTEMPT TO KEEP THIS AS SPOILER FREE AS POSSIBLE***<br /><br />This is, without a doubt, one of the greatest novels I have ever read. That being for many reasons:<br /><br />1. The palpable emotions that this book conveys - I guarantee that you will laugh. I guarantee that you will cry. This incredible novel calls upon every human emotion and forces you to live the story. I will not hesitate to admit that I sobbed whilst reading this. I also laughed so hard that I had to take a moment to gather myself. If you don't like public displays of emotion, don't read this book outside the home.<br /><br />2. The characters are just so realistic - Enough said. There weren't many cliches (of course there were a few, cliches are EVERYWHERE and NO archetypes that I could see. No one was flawless, no one was so imperfect that no one could stand it. Everyone was the beautiful mixture of flaws and perfection. Not only this, their personalities were so realistic that they jumped off the page and sat right next to you as you read about their turmoils (for there are plenty of turmoils). You fall in love with characters, but there are also things about them that you can't stand. You come to despise characters, but their were things about them that you liked. Just like actual people, no?<br /><br />3. The story itself is VERY realistic - Again, self-explanatory. All these things could happen (in a way, they do happen). There aren't many corny coincidences (the ones that are there are beautifully explained), and everything is just so REAL. It has a realness to it that few other books capture. I can't find anything else to say about it other than, IT'S SO REAL.<br /><br />4. The narration - John Green does a beautiful job of putting us in Hazel's mind through her narrations. It's so perfect, I'm surprised it hasn't ascended to heaven. There were opinions (amazing), but not too many that we didn't get to form out own opinions (which sometimes happens with first person). Not onlywere scenes set beautifully and things explained fantastically, but you really got a teenagers voice. We didn't get an adult's pathetic attempt at trying to sound like an angsty teen. No, we got a teenager, a true teenager. It's incredible.<br /><br />5. Anything else that you could possibly fathom: IT HAS EVERYTHING: philosophy, romance, life, death, love, hate, excitement, disappointment, deepness, shallowness, and everything else. It is so incredible<br /><br />CITIQUES:<br />-At time it did get a tad bit philosophical (and by a tad bit, I mean a lot bit). If that's not your thing, push through it.<br />-References were made to \\"An Imperial Affliction\\" many times. I do not know if this book actually exists or not. It is explained well enough, but still. Too many referenced for my taste.<br />-I can't think of anything else, I just wanted more than two bullet points.<br /><br />All in all, this novel is incredible. It blows his previous work of Looking for Alaska out of the water (which is saying something because I consider Looking for Alaska one of the greatest novels of all time). I HIGHLY recommend it for ANYONE, for it is a must-read masterpiece made for anyone and everyone.
B00992CF6W|4.0|4 stars not 5 its fun but it needs to be updated I would wait till its updated before u bye it.
B000WC39SG|5.0|After the victory at Normandy the Allies launch operation market garden. It was a disaster. This movie depicts one of the biggest mistakes of WWII. The casting in thos movie is great. Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, and Robert Redford all play great roles in this movie. it is nearly 3 hours long, so it definitely has an epic vibe to it. If you haven't seen this movie you are missing out.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|I have purchased the phone app and the google tv app. I use the client on a roku and on my PC. It is nothing short of awesome.
B004LROMSO|5.0|There isn't much worth watching on TV anymore. Unless you want to watch people chase non existent ghosts or like to watch people pawn their junk off. This show is a breath of fresh air. It revisits the old King Arthur story. Even though it's been done plenty of times, a good show is a good show. This film has some good actors and a well done story line. There is also great action, drama, and suspense.  I'll skip talking about the plot since you probably have the general idea. I will say that Camelot is a great series and I think almost anyone can find something to love about it.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|It had the right characters but it had the wrong ending, suggesting a writer suffering sunlight affective disorder from long winter nights.
B002UNMWAG|5.0|The MacManus brothers have been hiding with their father in Ireland until the heat from their run in with the mafia blows over. They come back to the US after hearing of the murder of an old priest that they knew well. They gain a new partner and also have a new FBI agent on their tail almost as soon as they arrive to set things right.<br /><br />This sequel had been anticipated for quite a while. After all the anticipation one would think this movie may fail to live up to expectations. That is definitely not the case. I was very happy with this movie. It has everything that made the 1st one grear and more. The action, comedy, and all the great twists make this movie worthy of being called The Boondock Saints 2.
B000I3SYEI|5.0|This is the best Star Trek movie hands down.  This movie has everything a movie should have Excellent actors, script, and action.  There are some loose ends here and there but nothing that really detreacts from the overall movie.  If you don't like the movie you don't like Star Trek..
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is probably the best movie Mel Gibson has ever done. It has everything. Action, drama, romance, and suspense all overflow in this awesome film. There's even a dash of comedy thrown in there. This movie is written, directed, and acted out beautifully. The soundtrack is also unforgettable. The historical signifigance of Braveheart is also very profound. There's absolutely no reason for anyone to miss seeing or dislike this film. I think everyone needs to own Braveheart. This collector's edition has pretty many special features and is a great buy.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|Eric Church's 1st album \\"Sinners Like Me\\", is one of the best country-rock cd's, put out there in a long time.  Jay Joyce does a tremendous job producing this great album.  Eric was 28 at the time of this release, and i knew he would have a good future in upcoming years.  Here you get 12 great tracks in,  the smokin' \\"Before She Does\\", the title track #51, that should of been a big hit (radio programmers still don't understand Eric Church).  \\"Lightning\\", which is a fantastic song, kind of like the movie \\"The Green Mile\\", the lyrics here are just beyond excellent.  The banjo picking of \\"How Bout You\\", his first hit #14, the many roads of \\"These Boots\\", the reflection of what life could of been on \\"What I Almost Was\\", his third top 40 hit \\"Guys Like Me\\" #17, great single should of hit top 5.  \\"Pledge Allegiance To The Hag\\", about the legend Merle Haggard, great in concert song, the chorus is great in \\"Tip our hats and raise our glasses of cold cold beer\\".  The melodic \\"Can't Take It With You\\", his 2nd big hit \\"Two Pink Lines\\",  #19, a super story song, fun stuff, with good harmonica work by Michael Rapheal, and the strutting of \\"Livin' Part Of Life\\".  This is a classic debut by Eric Church!
B004WGIXX4|1.0|I never thought I'd say that Ashton Kutcher is a better actor than Natalie Portman.  This movie boasts at least two Oscar winners, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.
